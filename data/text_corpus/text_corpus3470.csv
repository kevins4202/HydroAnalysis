17350,photodegradation of the natural steroid 17β estradiol e2 an endocrine disrupting hormone that has been widely detected in aquatic environments was investigated in wastewater effluents at various ph ranges under simulated solar irradiation the rate of e2 degradation in the sewage effluents was stable at ph 6 0 7 0 but suddenly increased from ph 8 0 10 0 the second order reaction rate constants of e2 with 3efom and co3 were measured to increase 11 0 fold and 18 0 fold from ph 6 0 to 10 0 respectively two main reasons are proposed for this sharp increase first the change in the ionization state of e2 made it susceptible to oxidation by triplet state effluent organic matter 3efom and carbonate radicals co3 second the steady state concentration of co3 increased with increasing ph indirect photolysis was suggested to be the main degradation pathway in the sewage effluents and 3efom was proposed to play a major role at ph 8 0 9 0 while co3 played a significant role at ph 10 0 in this study efom was shown for the first time to inhibit the oxidation of e2 initiated by 3efom and co3 thus we suggest that efom plays a dual role in the photodegradation of e2 efom can not only be activated as 3efom to degrade e2 but also can inhibit the degradation of e2 by reducing the e2 oxidation intermediate back to e2 the estrogenic activity of the photodegradation products was also studied the in vitro estrogenic activity of e2 solutions decreased approximately as fast as the e2 photodegradation occurred in the effluent water at various ph values suggesting that solar photodegradation in sewage effluents reduces the risk of endocrine disruption in waters impacted by e2 and subject to continuing inputs the results of this study are important for predicting the environmental fate of endocrine disrupting chemicals and developing methods for their removal from aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photodegradation sewage effluent endocrine disrupting chemicals reactive oxygen species inhibitory effect 1 introduction the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in aquatic environments has garnered significant attention among scientists and the public since the widespread feminization of male fish was first observed downstream of wastewater treatment plants wwtps jobling et al 1998 edcs include a wide range of industrial chemicals synthetic pharmaceuticals and natural steroid estrogens bolong et al 2009 which can interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine system and present a potential threat to aquatic life and human health most natural edcs exist in human and animal excreta and can enter surface and ground water through a variety of waste treatment facilities such as urban sewage treatment plants waste ponds and livestock waste disposal facilities leech et al 2009 among the edcs 17β estradiol e2 is one of the most studied endogenous estrogens bradley et al 2009 fan et al 2007 johnson et al 2014 e2 is responsible for the development of female secondary sex characteristics and reproduction hecker et al 2002 in addition to its endogenous occurrence this natural estrogen is manufactured and used in oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy in large quantities astedt et al 1977 it was reported that the concentration of e2 in domestic sewage effluents ranges from 1 to 50 ng l 1 ohko et al 2002 while studies have shown that fish change their sexuality upon exposure to e2 even at a concentration as low as 0 5 ng l 1 hu et al 2003 therefore knowledge of the fate of e2 after discharge into natural aquatic systems via effluents is essential for ecological risk assessment phototransformation driven by sunlight is one of the most important natural processes in the attenuation of e2 in surface water several studies have reported on the photodegradation of e2 during the photosensitized transformation of natural organic matter nom chowdhury et al 2011 diaz et al 2009 liu et al 2017 it was reported that the removal of e2 is mainly due to photosensitization initiated by nom bertoldi et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2011 leech et al 2009 silva et al 2016 and photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as hydroxyl radicals ho organic matter in the triplet state singlet oxygen 1o2 carbonate radical co3 and superoxide ion o2 are involved grebel et al 2012 jasper and sedlak 2013 although previous studies focused on the photodegradation of e2 in natural waters bertoldi et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2010 leech et al 2009 liu and liu 2004 silva et al 2016 sewage effluents were reckoned to be the most important origin of e2 in the aquatic environment shon et al 2006 moreover effluent organic matter efom has different photochemical properties compared to nom for example triplet states of effluent organic matters 3efom exhibited higher energy than triplet states of nom 3nom zhou et al 2019 meanwhile the quantum yields of ho and 1o2 are higher in the efom lee et al 2013 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 therefore the phototransformation and fate of e2 in efom may be different from those in nom however the photodegradation of e2 in municipal sewage effluents has rarely been reported additionally in sunlit surface water contaminant oxidation initiated by ppris may be inhibited by nom canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2011 via the reduction of oxidation intermediates back to their parent compounds nom has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of aquatic contaminants in particular anilines by excited triplet induced oxidation sulfate radicals so4 and co3 canonica and laubscher 2008 canonica and schönenberger 2019 hao et al 2020 no nom induced reduction was observed for the reaction of ho with a series of organic compounds wenk et al 2011 however the analogous inhibitory effects of efom are largely unknown thus it is important to elucidate the inhibitory effect of efom on e2 transformation in natural aquatic systems the current study aims to study the phototransformation of e2 in wastewater effluents the roles of several ppris including triplet state effluent organic matter 3efom 1o2 ho o2 and co3 in e2 photodegradation in the effluents were reevaluated and the rate constants for the reactions of those ppris with e2 were determined at various ph values moreover experiments were performed to quantify the potential inhibitory effects on the oxidation of e2 induced by ppris a photochemical model considering the contribution of ppris and the inhibition factor if was used to predict e2 photodegradation finally estrogenic activity assessments were performed to assess the potential disrupting effects of e2 degradation products on aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1

80 methanol a fluorescence detector fld was employed to measure the concentration of e2 with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 280 and 310 nm respectively 2 3 photolysis experiment an atlas solar simulator suntest xls equipped with a 1700 w xenon lamp and a solar filter to block the irradiance below 290 nm was employed to conduct the irradiation experiment the temperature was set at 25 c suncool the irradiation intensity on the surface of the solutions was set to 40 w m 2 1 36 10 8 einstein s 1 cm 2 at 290 400 nm the irradiation intensity spectra of the simulated solar light and natural sunlight were recorded using a spectrometer usb 4000 ocean optics inc as shown in our previous studies li et al 2016 lian et al 2017 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2017b all solutions were prepared using ultrapure di water the experimental concentrations of e2 and efom were 0 2 mg l 1 and 5 0 mgc l 1 respectively control experiment e2 efom dark were performed to check the possible interferences such as adsorption the degradation of e2 was negligible in these experiments the data were shown in figure s1 of the supplementary materials ipa was employed as ho scavengers to explore the role of 1o2 in the degradation of e2 a solution containing e2 0 2 mg l 1 and efom 5 0 mgc l 1 was prepared in d2o all solutions were adjusted to the target ph by using phosphate buffer and placed in custom made cylindrical quartz containers diameter 6 0 cm height 2 0 cm thickness 0 2 cm samples were removed at set time intervals 1 h 2h 3 h 4 h and 5 h during illumination and retained for analysis 2 4 bimolecular second order reaction rates of e2 with the ppris the bimolecular second order reaction rates of e2 with the ppris co3 ho and 1o2 at different ph values can be calculated based on competition kinetics by using eq 1 1 ln c c 0 l n e 2 e 2 0 k c p p r i s k e 2 p p r i s where the term in square brackets denotes the molar concentration k e 2 p p r i s is the second order reaction rate constant m 1 s 1 between e2 and ppris and k c p p r i s denotes the reaction rate constant of ppris with competitors ho and co3 were generated by uv254 nm irradiation of h2o2 and ctc respectively pcba and ipu were used as competitors rose bengal 0 1 mm was irradiated in a sunlight simulator to generate 1o2 and ffa was employed as a competitor k p cba h o k i p u c o 3 and k f f a 1 o 2 values of 5 109 m 1 s 1 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 and 8 3 107 m 1 s 1 respectively were reported boreen et al 2008 canonica et al 2005 neta and dorfman 1968 the rate constant for the bimolecular reaction of o2 with e2 was measured using the method reported in our previous study ma et al 2020 the detailed procedures mentioned above can be found in text s2 s5 and figure s2 s5 of the supplementary materials the methods reported in our previously published works were employed for measuring the steady state concentration of ppris ppris ss furfuryl alcohol terephthalic acid and sorbic alcohol were employed as probes to detect 1o2 ss ho ss and 3efom ss li et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 o2 ss was directly measured by using a chemiluminescent method ma et al 2019 co3 ss was calculated by the model developed in our previous study yan et al 2019 the data can be found in figure s6 s8 of the supplementary materials 2 5 inhibition factor the inhibitory effect of efom on the transformation of e2 induced by 3efom and co3 was measured in this study the ifs for 3efom at various concentrations of efom efom were investigated by using photoexcited cbbp as the oxidant canonica and laubscher 2008 the ifs for co3 at various efom were measured based on earlier publications canonica and schönenberger 2019 hao et al 2020 in brief ctcs were irradiated under uv254nm to generate pure co3 ipu was used as the competitor to detect the reaction rate with e2 since the degradation of ipu is not affected by dom in co3 induced oxidation reactions hao et al 2020 furthermore the pka value of ipu was calculated as 15 0 which indicated that the value of k i p u c o 3 would keep constant at ph range of 6 0 10 0 the possible interferences by direct or indirect phototransformation reactions of e2 and ipu were eliminated by the control experiments with irradiation were performed with ctc free solutions no significant degradation of e2 or ipu could be detected in the competition kinetics experiments indicating that side reactions could be neglected in this study moreover the co2 involved photosensitized oxidation was examined by irradiation of a pre illuminated ctc solution mixing with e2 the results of the control experiments are shown in figure s9 of the supplementary materials 2 6 estrogenic activity assay the estrogenic activity of e2 during photodegradation was tracked by an estrogenic activity assay by using the recommended yeast expressing human estrogen receptor her as previously described li et al 2008 briefly the recommended yeast was grown in synthetic dextrose sd medium sd leu trp for 24 h at 30 c with shaking at 150 rpm and the od600 of the culture was measured by a plate reader biotek synergy ht then the yeast culture was transferred to a 96 well plate and fresh liquid medium was added to bring wells to a final volume of 180 μl with an od600 of 0 4 0 5 next 20 μl of 1 2 serially diluted e2 analyte standards e2 at known concentrations or photolysis solutions was added to each well a set of positive controls e2 and negative controls only phosphate buffer were run on each plate and each sample was analyzed at least in triplicate then the plates were incubated in the dark at 30 c for 3 5 h with shaking at 800 rpm after centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min beckman coulter avanti j 26 xpi 150 μl of supernatant was discarded and then 120 μl of test buffer na2hpo4 12h2o 2 15 nah2po4 2h2o 0 62 kcl 0 07 mgso4 7h2o 0 03 sodium dodecyl sulfonate sds 0 0033 and mercaptoethanol 0 27 and 20 μl of chloroform were added to each well and incubated for 10 min at room temperature to initiate the reaction 40 μl of o nitrophenyl β d galactopyranoside o npg was added to each well after incubation at 30 c with shaking at 800 rpm for 20 min 100 μl of 1 0 m na2co3 was added to each well and incubated for 10 min to stop the β galactosidase reaction the plates were then centrifuged for 2 min 200 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new 96 well plate and the od420 was measured by a plate reader the β galactosidase activity u was calculated by eq 2 as described in the literature ma et al 2005 2 u o d 420 s o d 420 b t v o d 600 d where od420s and od420b are the od420 values of the samples and controls respectively t is the β galactosidase reaction time which was 20 min in the present study v is the test volume which was 0 2 ml in the present study and d is the dilution ratio before and after the addition of na2co3 1 0 m the dose response u curves were fitted to a four parameter logistic model by using graphpad prism 5 version 5 04 and the 50 effective concentrations ec50 were calculated from each curve the estrogenic equivalent quantity eeq of the photolysis samples was calculated using the following eq 3 3 eeq ec 50 e 2 ec 50 photolysis samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 the role of ppris in the photodegradation of e2 a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the photodegradation of e2 in efom solutions under simulated solar irradiation at ph 8 0 and ph 10 0 fig 1 depicts the photolysis of e2 in phosphate buffered solution and the negligible overlap of the uv absorption of e2 with the solar irradiation spectrum liu and liu 2004 matheson et al 1978 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 zuo et al 2006 suggested that the direct photodegradation rate of e2 was slow k d i r e c t 6 33 0 21 10 6 s 1 at ph 8 0 and 6 37 0 42 10 6 s 1 at ph 10 0 in the efom solutions the photodegradation followed pseudo first order decay and rate constants k e f o m of 4 25 0 16 10 5 s 1 at ph 8 0 and 6 78 0 07 10 5 s 1 at ph 10 0 were reported which represents a notable increase because indirect photodegradation occurred furthermore the results illustrate that the degradation rate sharply increased as a function of ph in general indirect photodegradation involves ppris 3efom ho 1o2 o2 and co3 to determine the role of ppris in e2 phototransformation ppri quenched enhanced experiments were performed first to determine the role of ho in e2 photodegradation ipa was employed as a ho scavenger compared with the degradation rate in sewage effluent that in ipa spiked samples k i p a was slightly decreased which indicated that ho played a minor role in indirect photodegradation a contribution of ho k e f o m k i p a k e f o m k d i r e c t of 2 0 at ph 8 0 and 1 0 at ph 10 0 could be calculated to explore the role of 1o2 d2o was applied as the solvent instead of h2o since 1o2 has a longer lifetime in d2o solutions than in h2o solutions merkel and kearns 1972 zepp et al 1977 rates of e2 photolysis in efom d2o solution of 4 77 0 16 10 5 s 1 at ph 8 0 and 8 02 0 04 10 5 s 1 at ph 10 0 were measured which was not significantly different from the rates in the efom h2o solutions these results suggest a limited contribution of ho and 1o2 it was reported that co3 can be generated from one electron oxidation of co3 2 and hco3 by ho and 3nom behar et al 1970 canonica et al 2005 sulzberger et al 1997 thus the role of co3 in e2 photodegradation was identified in efom solution with dissolved inorganic carbonate dic as shown in fig 1 when dic spiked the pseudo first order degradation rate of e2 in dic spiked efom solution k d i c at ph 8 0 cannot be distinguished from k e f o m suggesting that the impact of co3 at ph 8 0 is negligible this result is in agreement with a previous study liu et al 2017 however at ph 10 0 k d i c was significantly higher than k e f o m suggesting an important role of co3 in e2 photodegradation at high ph values to investigate the role of 3efom the effects of dissolved oxygen do were investigated in wastewater effluent since o2 is a well known 3efom quencher a change in the concentration of do do would lead to enhanced or attenuated 3efom ss chen et al 2009 our results demonstrated that the degradation rate of e2 was inversely related to do from 0 5 mg l 1 to 20 0 mg l 1 fig 2 a the degradation rate of e2 was approximately 6 03 fold higher at 0 5 mg l 1 do than at 20 0 mg l 1 demonstrating that 3efom was the primary reactive species 3 2 influence of ph on the photolysis of e2 the abovementioned results indicated that the photodegradation behavior of e2 could differ on the basis of ph however the detailed mechanism for this behavior is largely unknown the role of ppris in e2 photodegradation was studied at varying ph values ranging from 6 0 to 10 0 bear et al 2017 jasper and sedlak 2013 as shown in fig 2b the rate of e2 photodegradation increased from 2 82 10 5 s 1 to 3 10 10 4 s 1 as the ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 in wastewater effluent we propose two reasons for this increase first as a monoprotic acid deprotonated e2 e2dep under alkalic conditions reacts faster with ppris than does neutral e2 e2neu second the steady state concentrations of some ppris such as 1o2 and co3 may increase with increasing ph as listed in table 1 in this study the bimolecular second order rate constants for the reaction of e2 with ppris were measured at various ph values as shown in fig 3 the second order rate constant for 1o2 k e 2 1 o 2 underwent an insignificant change from ph 6 0 to 7 0 1 39 107 m 1 s 1 but sharply increased when the ph increased from 8 0 to 10 0 1 67 107 to 1 07 108 m 1 s 1 the bimolecular second order rate constant for co3 k e 2 c o 3 dramatically changed with the ph as illustrated in fig 3a k e 2 c o 3 remained constant at an average value of 5 85 107 m 1 s 1 as the ph increased from 6 0 8 0 but increased approximately 17 0 fold when the ph increased to 10 0 different from those for 1o2 and co3 the bimolecular rate constants for ho k e 2 h o and o2 k e 2 o 2 were measured to be 9 5 109 m 1 s 1 and 8 95 102 m 1 s 1 respectively and these k values remained constant at ph 6 0 10 0 data not shown nevertheless the extraordinarily slow value of k e 2 o 2 implies that o2 is not involved in e2 phototransformation clearly the values of k e 2 c o 3 and k e 2 1 o 2 increased as a function of ph in accordance with the increase in the second order rate constant for the reaction of phenol with 1o2 as the ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 diaz et al 2009 scully jr and hoigné 1987 it was reported that the second order rate constants for the reaction of methylphenol with 1o2 at ph 9 0 were nearly two orders of magnitude faster than those at ph 7 0 considering that a pka of 10 4 was reported for e2 hurwitz and liu 1977 which is close to the pka of methylphenol 10 2 it could be speculated that e2 has a mechanism similar to that of methylphenol with 1o2 and co3 since e2 is a monoprotic acid the ph dependence of k can be attributed to a combination of effects derived from co3 1o2 reacting with dissimilar e2 species e2neu and e2dep under alkaline conditions the phenolic group of e2 was deprotonated to form phenolate ions which react with co3 1o2 emerged at a notably higher rate compared with phenolic groups phenolate ions are much more vulnerable to attack by other ppris schwarzenbach et al 2003 thus the species specific second order rate constants were calculated using least squares regression of the experimental data and were quantitatively modeled by eq 4 4 k e 2 a p p 1 1 10 p k a p h k e 2 d e p p p r i s 10 p k a p h 1 10 p k a p h k e 2 n e u p p r i s where k e 2 d e p p p r i s is the second order rate constant for the reaction of e2dep with co3 1o2 and k e 2 n e u p p r i s is the second order rate constant for the reaction of e2neu with co3 1o2 as shown in fig 3 a and b a good correlation between the experimental and modeled values was obtained the change in k corresponds to the distribution of e2neu and e2dep according to eq 4 second rate constants for the reactions of e2neu and e2dep with co3 of 5 40 0 30 107 m 1 s 1 and 2 4 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 respectively were calculated for 1o2 2 40 0 60 107 m 1 s 1 and 1 30 0 10 108 m 1 s 1 were measured respectively therefore the efficiency of e2 removal is controlled not only by the rate of its reaction with ppris but also by the steady state concentration of the ppris in the reaction solution the ppris ss in bulk solutions was determined by using chemical probes and mathematical calculations as shown in table 1 ho ss and 1o2 ss were measured by using the chemical probes terephthalic acid and furfuryl alcohol respectively haag and hoigne 1986 mark et al 1998 as a result the ho ss values monotonically decreased as a function of ph while co3 ss exhibited the opposite trend since co3 2 exhibited a higher reaction rate constant with ho than did hco3 the rate of ho quenching and the rate of co3 formation may have increased at high ph no significant change was observed for 1o2 ss 3efom ss or o2 ss in the studied ph range according to previous studies the contribution of ppris can be calculated based on the measured steady state concentrations and the bimolecular reaction rate constants however a new reaction between the reduced moieties in nom and organic compounds was reported which may have a great effect on the photodegradation of contaminants thus this effect was further investigated in our study to more precisely evaluate the role of ppris in e2 photodegradation 3 3 influence of the if on the photolysis of e2 in surface waters nom was reported to play an important role in the phototransformation of organic compounds in general nom can generate ppris which can lead to not only the degradation of organic contaminants but also competition between the ppris and contaminants a third effect of nom was reported in recent years nom can inhibit the oxidation of organic compounds initiated by excited triplet states so4 and co3 leading to inaccurate estimation of photodegradation when using a first order model canonica and laubscher 2008 at the same time nom induced reduction was not observed for the reaction of ho with a series of organic compounds the if can vary among nom organic compounds and oxidation agents thus in this study the inhibitory effects of efom on the 3efom and co3 oxidation of e2 were evaluated as shown in eq 5 10 a model developed by canonica and schönenberger 2019 was employed to explain the dependence of if on efom as we proposed in the above section the ppris 3efom and co3 oxidation of e2 can generate the intermediate e2 eq 5 e2 can be oxidized into the stable oxidation product e2ox eq 6 when efom is involved some of the e2 can be reduced back to e2 by efom eq 7 eqs 8 10 demonstrate that the oxidized efom intermediates react with e2 and lead to e2 degradation 5 ppris e 2 ppri s r e d e 2 k e 2

laubscher 2008 canonica and schönenberger 2019 hao et al 2020 however there are some differences between the calculations for 3efom and co3 for 3efom the if if sens was calculated according to eq 11 11 i f s e n s k s e n s e f o m c o r r k s e n s c o r r where k s e n s c o r r is the obtained corrected rate constant without efom as shown in figure s10a k s e n s c o r r k c b b p k b l a n k k s e n s e f o m c o r r is the corrected rate constant determined for samples with efom k s e n s e f o m c o r r k c b b p e f o m k e f o m the if was calculated according to eq 12 12 i f s e n s 1 1 ef o m ef o m 1 2 where ef o m 1 2 is defined as the concentration of efom at if 0 5 overall the inhibitory effects of efom on 3efom oxidation of e2 were examined at various ph values ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 as shown in fig 4 a if decreased monotonically as the efom concentration increased 0 5 0 mgc l 1 efom 1 2 values of 5 45 0 54 4 91 0 45 and 8 06 0 87 mgc l 1 were measured at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 respectively for co3 the if is defined by eq 13 13 i f c o 3 k c y n c o 3 a p p d o m k c y n c o 3 a p p d o m 0 where k c y n c o 3 a p p d o m 0 and k c y n c o 3 a p p d o m are the measured reaction rate constants with without dom respectively as demonstrated in figure s10b the inhibition factor i f c o 3 can also be expressed as eq 14 further information on the derivation of eq 14 can be found in the literature canonica and schönenberger 2019 14 if c o 3 1 1 ef o m ef o m 1 2 d ris ef o m where efom 1 2 k e 2 k c o 3 d o m r e d dris represent the reactivity of e2 with the efom intermediates risefom relative to its reactivity with co3 as shown in fig 4b there was a significant decrease in the if when efom increased from 0 2 0 mgc l 1 followed by a slight increase when efom exceeded 3 mgc l 1 this observed increase in if at higher efom concentrations suggests that the secondary reactive intermediates ris formed from the reaction of co3 with efom may create additional e2 transformation routes ef o m 1 2 values of 2 41 0 14 1 55 0 45 and 1 81 0 28 mgc l 1 were fitted at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 respectively indicating that the inhibitory effect of efom on the oxidation of e2 by co3 cannot be neglected the dris for ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 were 0 027 0 041 and 0 056 l mgc 1 respectively the detailed data are shown in figure s11 and s12 3 4 assessment of the role of ppris in e2 photodegradation at various ph values to further assess the role of ppris in e2 photodegradation the contributions of ppris to e2 regeneration related to photodegradation in effluent water at various ph values were estimated based on the following equation eq 15 15 k t o t k d i r e c t k e 2 3 e f o m 3 e f o m s s i f 3 e f o m k e 2 h o h o s s k e 2 co 3 c o 3 s s i f co 3 k e 2 1 o 2 1 o 2 s s k e 2 o 2 o 2 s s as shown in fig 5 the predicted contributions of each photolysis mechanism to the overall rate of e2 photolysis at various ph values were similar to those observed when using quenchers fig 1 3efom played the most important role at ph value from 8 0 9 0 considering that the value of 3efom ss remained constant while the contribution of 3efom to the photodegradation rate increased from ph 6 0 to 10 0 we suggest that the rate of the reaction of 3efom with e2 increased with ph the k values were estimated to increase 11 0 fold from ph 6 0 to 10 0 e2 photodegradation at high ph values due to the increased rates of the reaction of co3 with the deprotonated species at alkaline ph values and the significantly increased co3 ss it can be predicted that co3 play the most important role when ph higher than 10 0 these results were different from the results in the nom solutions which reported that ho played an important role in the photodegradation of e2 and its analogues in the nom chen et al 2013 leech et al 2009 note that the average values of if at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 were applied in the calculation of the contributions of ppris these values were 0 5 and 0 9 for 3efom and co3 respectively 3 5 estrogenic activity assessments of e2 phototransformation products the degradation of e2 and measurement of its estrogenic activities are of great importance for water treatment in addition to kinetic studies on the photodegradation of e2 in sewage effluents the estrogenic activities were also a focus of this study an estrogenic activity assay using the recommended yeast was employed to determine the estrogenicity of e2 photodegradation products the human estrogen receptor her is expressed in this recommended yeast during the estrogenic activity assay and causes transcription of a promoter that carries estrogen responsive sequences by an estrogen dependent mode routledge and sumpter 1996 in this study three representative samples were taken during e2 degradation in sewage effluent one each at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 to study the estrogenic activity of phototransformation products produced by different mechanisms fig 6 a b and c shows the change in estrogenic activity determined by means of the estrogenic activity assay of ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 sewage effluent respectively we combined biological and chemical analyses to explore the decrease in and disappearance of the estrogenic activity of e2 under various conditions all three experiments showed that the observed estrogenic activities paralleled the concentration of e2 measured by hplc fld these results implied that estrogenic products were not formed to a significant extent and or did not exhibit activity under our experimental conditions as shown in fig 6 mao et al has investigated the estrogenicity of the transformation products after oxidation by lignin peroxidase results demonstrated that the dimer and trimer are the predominant products of e2 which are not estrogenic mao et al 2010 in this study similar products were detected by hplc apci qtof data not shown the estrogenic assessments results indicated that the solar irradiation can efficiently remove the estrogenicity 4 conclusions e2 is a typical edc in our study a series of experiments were performed to determine the roles of ppris and the effects of ph on the indirect photolysis of e2 in sewage effluent the if which refers to the efom induced reduction in the rate of e2 oxidation by 3efom and co3 was investigated and the estrogenic activity of the phototransformation products of e2 was evaluated according to our experimental results 3efom made the major contribution to the photolysis of e2 in sewage effluent at high ph value while co3 played an important role at ph 10 0 furthermore the second order rate constants for the reaction of e2 with co3 and 1o2 increased with ph the estrogenic activity of the phototransformation products of e2 at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 was negligible

17350,photodegradation of the natural steroid 17β estradiol e2 an endocrine disrupting hormone that has been widely detected in aquatic environments was investigated in wastewater effluents at various ph ranges under simulated solar irradiation the rate of e2 degradation in the sewage effluents was stable at ph 6 0 7 0 but suddenly increased from ph 8 0 10 0 the second order reaction rate constants of e2 with 3efom and co3 were measured to increase 11 0 fold and 18 0 fold from ph 6 0 to 10 0 respectively two main reasons are proposed for this sharp increase first the change in the ionization state of e2 made it susceptible to oxidation by triplet state effluent organic matter 3efom and carbonate radicals co3 second the steady state concentration of co3 increased with increasing ph indirect photolysis was suggested to be the main degradation pathway in the sewage effluents and 3efom was proposed to play a major role at ph 8 0 9 0 while co3 played a significant role at ph 10 0 in this study efom was shown for the first time to inhibit the oxidation of e2 initiated by 3efom and co3 thus we suggest that efom plays a dual role in the photodegradation of e2 efom can not only be activated as 3efom to degrade e2 but also can inhibit the degradation of e2 by reducing the e2 oxidation intermediate back to e2 the estrogenic activity of the photodegradation products was also studied the in vitro estrogenic activity of e2 solutions decreased approximately as fast as the e2 photodegradation occurred in the effluent water at various ph values suggesting that solar photodegradation in sewage effluents reduces the risk of endocrine disruption in waters impacted by e2 and subject to continuing inputs the results of this study are important for predicting the environmental fate of endocrine disrupting chemicals and developing methods for their removal from aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photodegradation sewage effluent endocrine disrupting chemicals reactive oxygen species inhibitory effect 1 introduction the presence of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in aquatic environments has garnered significant attention among scientists and the public since the widespread feminization of male fish was first observed downstream of wastewater treatment plants wwtps jobling et al 1998 edcs include a wide range of industrial chemicals synthetic pharmaceuticals and natural steroid estrogens bolong et al 2009 which can interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine system and present a potential threat to aquatic life and human health most natural edcs exist in human and animal excreta and can enter surface and ground water through a variety of waste treatment facilities such as urban sewage treatment plants waste ponds and livestock waste disposal facilities leech et al 2009 among the edcs 17β estradiol e2 is one of the most studied endogenous estrogens bradley et al 2009 fan et al 2007 johnson et al 2014 e2 is responsible for the development of female secondary sex characteristics and reproduction hecker et al 2002 in addition to its endogenous occurrence this natural estrogen is manufactured and used in oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy in large quantities astedt et al 1977 it was reported that the concentration of e2 in domestic sewage effluents ranges from 1 to 50 ng l 1 ohko et al 2002 while studies have shown that fish change their sexuality upon exposure to e2 even at a concentration as low as 0 5 ng l 1 hu et al 2003 therefore knowledge of the fate of e2 after discharge into natural aquatic systems via effluents is essential for ecological risk assessment phototransformation driven by sunlight is one of the most important natural processes in the attenuation of e2 in surface water several studies have reported on the photodegradation of e2 during the photosensitized transformation of natural organic matter nom chowdhury et al 2011 diaz et al 2009 liu et al 2017 it was reported that the removal of e2 is mainly due to photosensitization initiated by nom bertoldi et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2011 leech et al 2009 silva et al 2016 and photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as hydroxyl radicals ho organic matter in the triplet state singlet oxygen 1o2 carbonate radical co3 and superoxide ion o2 are involved grebel et al 2012 jasper and sedlak 2013 although previous studies focused on the photodegradation of e2 in natural waters bertoldi et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2010 leech et al 2009 liu and liu 2004 silva et al 2016 sewage effluents were reckoned to be the most important origin of e2 in the aquatic environment shon et al 2006 moreover effluent organic matter efom has different photochemical properties compared to nom for example triplet states of effluent organic matters 3efom exhibited higher energy than triplet states of nom 3nom zhou et al 2019 meanwhile the quantum yields of ho and 1o2 are higher in the efom lee et al 2013 mostafa and rosario ortiz 2013 therefore the phototransformation and fate of e2 in efom may be different from those in nom however the photodegradation of e2 in municipal sewage effluents has rarely been reported additionally in sunlit surface water contaminant oxidation initiated by ppris may be inhibited by nom canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2011 via the reduction of oxidation intermediates back to their parent compounds nom has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of aquatic contaminants in particular anilines by excited triplet induced oxidation sulfate radicals so4 and co3 canonica and laubscher 2008 canonica and schönenberger 2019 hao et al 2020 no nom induced reduction was observed for the reaction of ho with a series of organic compounds wenk et al 2011 however the analogous inhibitory effects of efom are largely unknown thus it is important to elucidate the inhibitory effect of efom on e2 transformation in natural aquatic systems the current study aims to study the phototransformation of e2 in wastewater effluents the roles of several ppris including triplet state effluent organic matter 3efom 1o2 ho o2 and co3 in e2 photodegradation in the effluents were reevaluated and the rate constants for the reactions of those ppris with e2 were determined at various ph values moreover experiments were performed to quantify the potential inhibitory effects on the oxidation of e2 induced by ppris a photochemical model considering the contribution of ppris and the inhibition factor if was used to predict e2 photodegradation finally estrogenic activity assessments were performed to assess the potential disrupting effects of e2 degradation products on aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1

supplementary materials text s1 carbonato tetramine cobalt iii chloride co nh3 4co3cl ctc was synthesized using a method reported in a previous study yan et al 2019 for the estrogenic assay the

measured by a toc analyzer sievers m9 portable toc analyzer 2 2 analytical method an agilent 1260 hplc system was used to determine the concentration of e2 the injection volume was 100 μl and a c18 analytical column agilent eclipse plus 1 8 μm 75 4 6 mm was used for separation the flow rate was set to 1 ml min 1 e2 was separated with 20 deionized di water containing 0 05 trifluoroacetic acid and 80 methanol a fluorescence detector fld was employed to measure the concentration of e2 with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 280 and 310 nm respectively 2 3 photolysis experiment an atlas solar simulator suntest xls equipped with a 1700 w xenon lamp and a solar filter to block the irradiance below 290 nm was employed to conduct the irradiation experiment the temperature was set at 25 c suncool the irradiation intensity on the surface of the solutions was set to 40 w m 2 1 36 10 8 einstein s 1 cm 2 at 290 400 nm the irradiation intensity spectra of the simulated solar light and natural sunlight were recorded using a spectrometer usb 4000 ocean optics inc as shown in our previous studies li et al 2016 lian et al 2017 liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2017b all solutions were prepared using ultrapure di water the experimental concentrations of e2 and efom were 0 2 mg l 1 and 5 0 mgc l 1 respectively control experiment e2 efom dark were performed to check the possible interferences such as adsorption the degradation of e2 was negligible in these experiments the data were shown in figure s1 of the supplementary materials ipa was employed as ho scavengers to explore the role of 1o2 in the degradation of e2 a solution containing e2 0 2 mg l 1 and efom 5 0 mgc l 1 was prepared in d2o all solutions were adjusted to the target ph by using phosphate buffer and placed in custom made cylindrical quartz containers diameter 6 0 cm height 2 0 cm thickness 0 2 cm samples were removed at set time intervals 1 h 2h 3 h 4 h and 5 h during illumination and retained for analysis 2 4 bimolecular second order reaction rates of e2 with the ppris the bimolecular second order reaction rates of e2 with the ppris co3 ho and 1o2 at different ph values can be calculated based on competition kinetics by using eq 1 1 ln c c 0 l n e 2 e 2 0 k c p p r i s k e 2 p p r i s where the term in square brackets denotes the molar concentration k e 2 p p r i s is the second order reaction rate constant m 1 s 1 between e2 and ppris and k c p p r i s denotes the reaction rate constant of ppris with competitors ho and co3 were generated by uv254 nm irradiation of h2o2 and ctc respectively pcba and ipu were used as competitors rose bengal 0 1 mm was irradiated in a sunlight simulator to generate 1o2 and ffa was employed as a competitor k p cba h o k i p u c o 3 and k f f a 1 o 2 values of 5 109 m 1 s 1 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 and 8 3 107 m 1 s 1 respectively were reported boreen et al 2008 canonica et al 2005 neta and dorfman 1968 the rate constant for the bimolecular reaction of o2 with e2 was measured using the method reported in our previous study ma et al 2020 the detailed procedures mentioned above can be found in text s2 s5 and figure s2 s5 of the supplementary materials the methods reported in our previously published works were employed for measuring the steady state concentration of ppris ppris ss furfuryl alcohol terephthalic acid and sorbic alcohol were employed as probes to detect 1o2 ss ho ss and 3efom ss li et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 o2 ss was directly measured by using a chemiluminescent method ma et al 2019 co3 ss was calculated by the model developed in our previous study yan et al 2019 the data can be found in figure s6 s8 of the supplementary materials 2 5 inhibition factor the inhibitory effect of efom on the transformation of e2 induced by 3efom and co3 was measured in this study the ifs for 3efom at various concentrations of efom efom were investigated by using photoexcited cbbp as the oxidant canonica and laubscher 2008 the ifs for co3 at various efom were measured based on earlier publications canonica and schönenberger 2019 hao et al 2020 in brief ctcs were irradiated under uv254nm to generate pure co3 ipu was used as the competitor to detect the reaction rate with e2 since the degradation of ipu is not affected by dom in co3 induced oxidation reactions hao et al 2020 furthermore the pka value of ipu was calculated as 15 0 which indicated that the value of k i p u c o 3 would keep constant at ph range of 6 0 10 0 the possible interferences by direct or indirect phototransformation reactions of e2 and ipu were eliminated by the control experiments with irradiation were performed with ctc free solutions no significant degradation of e2 or ipu could be detected in the competition kinetics experiments indicating that side reactions could be neglected in this study moreover the co2 involved photosensitized oxidation was examined by irradiation of a pre illuminated ctc solution mixing with e2 the results of the control experiments are shown in figure s9 of the supplementary materials 2 6 estrogenic activity assay the estrogenic activity of e2 during photodegradation was tracked by an estrogenic activity assay by using the recommended yeast expressing human estrogen receptor her as previously described li et al 2008 briefly the recommended yeast was grown in synthetic dextrose sd medium sd leu trp for 24 h at 30 c with shaking at 150 rpm and the od600 of the culture was measured by a plate reader biotek synergy ht then the yeast culture was transferred to a 96 well plate and fresh liquid medium was added to bring wells to a final volume of 180 μl with an od600 of 0 4 0 5 next 20 μl of 1 2 serially diluted e2 analyte standards e2 at known concentrations or photolysis solutions was added to each well a set of positive controls e2 and negative controls only phosphate buffer were run on each plate and each sample was analyzed at least in triplicate then the plates were incubated in the dark at 30 c for 3 5 h with shaking at 800 rpm after centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 2 min beckman coulter avanti j 26 xpi 150 μl of supernatant was discarded and then 120 μl of test buffer na2hpo4 12h2o 2 15 nah2po4 2h2o 0 62 kcl 0 07 mgso4 7h2o 0 03 sodium dodecyl sulfonate sds 0 0033 and mercaptoethanol 0 27 and 20 μl of chloroform were added to each well and incubated for 10 min at room temperature to initiate the reaction 40 μl of o nitrophenyl β d galactopyranoside o npg was added to each well after incubation at 30 c with shaking at 800 rpm for 20 min 100 μl of 1 0 m na2co3 was added to each well and incubated for 10 min to stop the β galactosidase reaction the plates were then centrifuged for 2 min 200 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new 96 well plate and the od420 was measured by a plate reader the β galactosidase activity u was calculated by eq 2 as described in the literature ma et al 2005 2 u o d 420 s o d 420 b t v o d 600 d where od420s and od420b are the od420 values of the samples and controls respectively t is the β galactosidase reaction time which was 20 min in the present study v is the test volume which was 0 2 ml in the present study and d is the dilution ratio before and after the addition of na2co3 1 0 m the dose response u curves were fitted to a four parameter logistic model by using graphpad prism 5 version 5 04 and the 50 effective concentrations ec50 were calculated from each curve the estrogenic equivalent quantity eeq of the photolysis samples was calculated using the following eq 3 3 eeq ec 50 e 2 ec 50 photolysis samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 the role of ppris in the photodegradation of e2 a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the photodegradation of e2 in efom solutions under simulated solar irradiation at ph 8 0 and ph 10 0 fig 1 depicts the photolysis of e2 in phosphate buffered solution and the negligible overlap of the uv absorption of e2 with the solar irradiation spectrum liu and liu 2004 matheson et al 1978 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 zuo et al 2006 suggested that the direct photodegradation rate of e2 was slow k d i r e c t 6 33 0 21 10 6 s 1 at ph 8 0 and 6 37 0 42 10 6 s 1 at ph 10 0 in the efom solutions the photodegradation followed pseudo first order decay and rate constants k e f o m of 4 25 0 16 10 5 s 1 at ph 8 0 and 6 78 0 07 10 5 s 1 at ph 10 0 were reported which represents a notable increase because indirect photodegradation occurred furthermore the results illustrate that the degradation rate sharply increased as a function of ph in general indirect photodegradation involves ppris 3efom ho 1o2 o2 and co3 to determine the role of ppris in e2 phototransformation ppri quenched enhanced experiments were performed first to determine the role of ho in e2 photodegradation ipa was employed as a ho scavenger compared with the degradation rate in sewage effluent that in ipa spiked samples k i p a was slightly decreased which indicated that ho played a minor role in indirect photodegradation a contribution of ho k e f o m k i p a k e f o m k d i r e c t of 2 0 at ph 8 0 and 1 0 at ph 10 0 could be calculated to explore the role of 1o2 d2o was applied as the solvent instead of h2o since 1o2 has a longer lifetime in d2o solutions than in h2o solutions merkel and kearns 1972 zepp et al 1977 rates of e2 photolysis in efom d2o solution of 4 77 0 16 10 5 s 1 at ph 8 0 and 8 02 0 04 10 5 s 1 at ph 10 0 were measured which was not significantly different from the rates in the efom h2o solutions these results suggest a limited contribution of ho and 1o2 it was reported that co3 can be generated from one electron oxidation of co3 2 and hco3 by ho and 3nom behar et al 1970 canonica et al 2005 sulzberger et al 1997 thus the role of co3 in e2 photodegradation was identified in efom solution with dissolved inorganic carbonate dic as shown in fig 1 when dic spiked the pseudo first order degradation rate of e2 in dic spiked efom solution k d i c at ph 8 0 cannot be distinguished from k e f o m suggesting that the impact of co3 at ph 8 0 is negligible this result is in agreement with a previous study liu et al 2017 however at ph 10 0 k d i c was significantly higher than k e f o m suggesting an important role of co3 in e2 photodegradation at high ph values to investigate the role of 3efom the effects of dissolved oxygen do were investigated in wastewater effluent since o2 is a well known 3efom quencher a change in the concentration of do do would lead to enhanced or attenuated 3efom ss chen et al 2009 our results demonstrated that the degradation rate of e2 was inversely related to do from 0 5 mg l 1 to 20 0 mg l 1 fig 2 a the degradation rate of e2 was approximately 6 03 fold higher at 0 5 mg l 1 do than at 20 0 mg l 1 demonstrating that 3efom was the primary reactive species 3 2 influence of ph on the photolysis of e2 the abovementioned results indicated that the photodegradation behavior of e2 could differ on the basis of ph however the detailed mechanism for this behavior is largely unknown the role of ppris in e2 photodegradation was studied at varying ph values ranging from 6 0 to 10 0 bear et al 2017 jasper and sedlak 2013 as shown in fig 2b the rate of e2 photodegradation increased from 2 82 10 5 s 1 to 3 10 10 4 s 1 as the ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 in wastewater effluent we propose two reasons for this increase first as a monoprotic acid deprotonated e2 e2dep under alkalic conditions reacts faster with ppris than does neutral e2 e2neu second the steady state concentrations of some ppris such as 1o2 and co3 may increase with increasing ph as listed in table 1 in this study the bimolecular second order rate constants for the reaction of e2 with ppris were measured at various ph values as shown in fig 3 the second order rate constant for 1o2 k e 2 1 o 2 underwent an insignificant change from ph 6 0 to 7 0 1 39 107 m 1 s 1 but sharply increased when the ph increased from 8 0 to 10 0 1 67 107 to 1 07 108 m 1 s 1 the bimolecular second order rate constant for co3 k e 2 c o 3 dramatically changed with the ph as illustrated in fig 3a k e 2 c o 3 remained constant at an average value of 5 85 107 m 1 s 1 as the ph increased from 6 0 8 0 but increased approximately 17 0 fold when the ph increased to 10 0 different from those for 1o2 and co3 the bimolecular rate constants for ho k e 2 h o and o2 k e 2 o 2 were measured to be 9 5 109 m 1 s 1 and 8 95 102 m 1 s 1 respectively and these k values remained constant at ph 6 0 10 0 data not shown nevertheless the extraordinarily slow value of k e 2 o 2 implies that o2 is not involved in e2 phototransformation clearly the values of k e 2 c o 3 and k e 2 1 o 2 increased as a function of ph in accordance with the increase in the second order rate constant for the reaction of phenol with 1o2 as the ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 diaz et al 2009 scully jr and hoigné 1987 it was reported that the second order rate constants for the reaction of methylphenol with 1o2 at ph 9 0 were nearly two orders of magnitude faster than those at ph 7 0 considering that a pka of 10 4 was reported for e2 hurwitz and liu 1977 which is close to the pka of methylphenol 10 2 it could be speculated that e2 has a mechanism similar to that of methylphenol with 1o2 and co3 since e2 is a monoprotic acid the ph dependence of k can be attributed to a combination of effects derived from co3 1o2 reacting with dissimilar e2 species e2neu and e2dep under alkaline conditions the phenolic group of e2 was deprotonated to form phenolate ions which react with co3 1o2 emerged at a notably higher rate compared with phenolic groups phenolate ions are much more vulnerable to attack by other ppris schwarzenbach et al 2003 thus the species specific second order rate constants were calculated using least squares regression of the experimental data and were quantitatively modeled by eq 4 4 k e 2 a p p 1 1 10 p k a p h k e 2 d e p p p r i s 10 p k a p h 1 10 p k a p h k e 2 n e u p p r i s where k e 2 d e p p p r i s is the second order rate constant for the reaction of e2dep with co3 1o2 and k e 2 n e u p p r i s is the second order rate constant for the reaction of e2neu with co3 1o2 as shown in fig 3 a and b a good correlation between the experimental and modeled values was obtained the change in k corresponds to the distribution of e2neu and e2dep according to eq 4 second rate constants for the reactions of e2neu and e2dep with co3 of 5 40 0 30 107 m 1 s 1 and 2 4 0 06 109 m 1 s 1 respectively were calculated for 1o2 2 40 0 60 107 m 1 s 1 and 1 30 0 10 108 m 1 s 1 were measured respectively therefore the efficiency of e2 removal is controlled not only by the rate of its reaction with ppris but also by the steady state concentration of the ppris in the reaction solution the ppris ss in bulk solutions was determined by using chemical probes and mathematical calculations as shown in table 1 ho ss and 1o2 ss were measured by using the chemical probes terephthalic acid and furfuryl alcohol respectively haag and hoigne 1986 mark et al 1998 as a result the ho ss values monotonically decreased as a function of ph while co3 ss exhibited the opposite trend since co3 2 exhibited a higher reaction rate constant with ho than did hco3 the rate of ho quenching and the rate of co3 formation may have increased at high ph no significant change was observed for 1o2 ss 3efom ss or o2 ss in the studied ph range according to previous studies the contribution of ppris can be calculated based on the measured steady state concentrations and the bimolecular reaction rate constants however a new reaction between the reduced moieties in nom and organic compounds was reported which may have a great effect on the photodegradation of contaminants thus this effect was further investigated in our study to more precisely evaluate the role of ppris in e2 photodegradation 3 3 influence of the if on the photolysis of e2 in surface waters nom was reported to play an important role in the phototransformation of organic compounds in general nom can generate ppris which can lead to not only the degradation of organic contaminants but also competition between the ppris and contaminants a third effect of nom was reported in recent years nom can inhibit the oxidation of organic compounds initiated by excited triplet states so4 and co3 leading to inaccurate estimation of photodegradation when using a first order model canonica and laubscher 2008 at the same time nom induced reduction was not observed for the reaction of ho with a series of organic compounds the if can vary among nom organic compounds and oxidation agents thus in this study the inhibitory effects of efom on the 3efom and co3 oxidation of e2 were evaluated as shown in eq 5 10 a model developed by canonica and schönenberger 2019 was employed to explain the dependence of if on efom as we proposed in the above section the ppris 3efom and co3 oxidation of e2 can generate the intermediate e2 eq 5 e2 can be oxidized into the stable oxidation product e2ox eq 6 when efom is involved some of the e2 can be reduced back to e2 by efom eq 7 eqs 8 10 demonstrate that the oxidized efom intermediates react with e2 and lead to e2 degradation 5 ppris e 2 ppri s r e d e 2 k e 2

laubscher 2008 canonica and schönenberger 2019 hao et al 2020 however there are some differences between the calculations for 3efom and co3 for 3efom the if if sens was calculated according to eq 11

and 10 0 as shown in fig 4 a if decreased monotonically as the efom concentration increased 0 5 0 mgc l 1 efom 1 2 values of 5 45 0 54 4 91 0 45 and 8 06 0 87 mgc l 1 were measured at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 respectively for co3 the if is defined by eq 13 13 i f c o 3 k c y n c o 3 a p p d o m k c y n c o 3 a p p d o m 0 where k c y n c o 3 a p p d o m 0 and k c y n c o 3 a p p d o m are the measured reaction rate constants with without dom respectively as demonstrated in figure s10b the inhibition factor i f c o 3 can also be expressed as eq 14 further information on the derivation of eq 14 can be found in the literature canonica and schönenberger 2019 14 if c o 3 1 1 ef o m ef o m 1 2 d ris ef o m where efom 1 2 k e 2 k c o 3 d o m r e d dris represent the reactivity of e2 with the efom intermediates risefom relative to its reactivity with co3 as shown in fig 4b there was a significant decrease in the if when efom increased from 0 2 0 mgc l 1 followed by a slight increase when efom exceeded 3 mgc l 1 this observed increase in if at higher efom concentrations suggests that the secondary reactive intermediates ris formed from the reaction of co3 with efom may create additional e2 transformation routes ef o m 1 2 values of 2 41 0 14 1 55 0 45 and 1 81 0 28 mgc l 1 were fitted at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 respectively indicating that the inhibitory effect of efom on the oxidation of e2 by co3 cannot be neglected the dris for ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 were 0 027 0 041 and 0 056 l mgc 1 respectively the detailed data are shown in figure s11 and s12 3 4 assessment of the role of ppris in e2 photodegradation at various ph values to further assess the role of ppris in e2 photodegradation the contributions of ppris to e2 regeneration related to photodegradation in effluent water at various ph values were estimated based on the following equation eq 15 15 k t o t k d i r e c t k e 2 3 e f o m 3 e f o m s s i f 3 e f o m k e 2 h o h o s s k e 2 co 3 c o 3 s s i f co 3 k e 2 1 o 2 1 o 2 s s k e 2 o 2 o 2 s s as shown in fig 5 the predicted contributions of each photolysis mechanism to the overall rate of e2 photolysis at various ph values were similar to those observed when using quenchers fig 1 3efom played the most important role at ph value from 8 0 9 0 considering that the value of 3efom ss remained constant while the contribution of 3efom to the photodegradation rate increased from ph 6 0 to 10 0 we suggest that the rate of the reaction of 3efom with e2 increased with ph the k values were estimated to increase 11 0 fold from ph 6 0 to 10 0 e2 photodegradation at high ph values due to the increased rates of the reaction of co3 with the deprotonated species at alkaline ph values and the significantly increased co3 ss it can be predicted that co3 play the most important role when ph higher than 10 0 these results were different from the results in the nom solutions which reported that ho played an important role in the photodegradation of e2 and its analogues in the nom chen et al 2013 leech et al 2009 note that the average values of if at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 were applied in the calculation of the contributions of ppris these values were 0 5 and 0 9 for 3efom and co3 respectively 3 5 estrogenic activity assessments of e2 phototransformation products the degradation of e2 and measurement of its estrogenic activities are of great importance for water treatment in addition to kinetic studies on the photodegradation of e2 in sewage effluents the estrogenic activities were also a focus of this study an estrogenic activity assay using the recommended yeast was employed to determine the estrogenicity of e2 photodegradation products the human estrogen receptor her is expressed in this recommended yeast during the estrogenic activity assay and causes transcription of a promoter that carries estrogen responsive sequences by an estrogen dependent mode routledge and sumpter 1996 in this study three representative samples were taken during e2 degradation in sewage effluent one each at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 to study the estrogenic activity of phototransformation products produced by different mechanisms fig 6 a b and c shows the change in estrogenic activity determined by means of the estrogenic activity assay of ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 sewage effluent respectively we combined biological and chemical analyses to explore the decrease in and disappearance of the estrogenic activity of e2 under various conditions all three experiments showed that the observed estrogenic activities paralleled the concentration of e2 measured by hplc fld these results implied that estrogenic products were not formed to a significant extent and or did not exhibit activity under our experimental conditions as shown in fig 6 mao et al has investigated the estrogenicity of the transformation products after oxidation by lignin peroxidase results demonstrated that the dimer and trimer are the predominant products of e2 which are not estrogenic mao et al 2010 in this study similar products were detected by hplc apci qtof data not shown the estrogenic assessments results indicated that the solar irradiation can efficiently remove the estrogenicity 4 conclusions e2 is a typical edc in our study a series of experiments were performed to determine the roles of ppris and the effects of ph on the indirect photolysis of e2 in sewage effluent the if which refers to the efom induced reduction in the rate of e2 oxidation by 3efom and co3 was investigated and the estrogenic activity of the phototransformation products of e2 was evaluated according to our experimental results 3efom made the major contribution to the photolysis of e2 in sewage effluent at high ph value while co3 played an important role at ph 10 0 furthermore the second order rate constants for the reaction of e2 with co3 and 1o2 increased with ph the estrogenic activity of the phototransformation products of e2 at ph 6 0 8 0 and 10 0 was negligible

17351,granulated activated carbon gac filtration is a common process for advanced wastewater treatment in such filters the removal of organic substances results from adsorptive as well as biological processes this work investigated the potential of biological processes and their influence on gac filter performance during 32 months the removal of micropollutants dissolved organic carbon doc and the spectral absorption coefficient was monitored in six gac filters the effects of pre treatment cloth and or membrane filtration ebct from 6 35 min and gac type were evaluated likewise the impact of the influent s fluctuations in temperature flow and concentration ammonia nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus srp were analysed biological processes were tracked by the frequency of backwashing oxygen consumption removal of poorly absorbable micropollutants and production of transformation products pre treatment influenced biofilm growth significantly membrane filtration delayed the first backwashing event by 122 d in comparison to cloth filtration where the first backwash was conducted after only 21 d removal of poorly absorbable substances was observed early on 40 50 d parallel operation contributed to a better utilisation of the gac capacity and the biological removal potential influent nitrogen species 0 5 mg n l promoted biofilm growth whereas srp seemed to have no effect the developed biofilm and optimal operating conditions led to longer life spans of the gac filters making carbon usage rates comparable to those from pac applications the results suggest that biological processes accounted for about 25 42 of the totally removed doc at the end of the operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated carbon filtration adsorption biodegradation empty bed contact time ebct micropollutants tertiary treatment 1 introduction the adsorption capacity of granulated activated carbon gac filters decreases with increasing operation time if biological activity is present within the gac filter organic substances are further removed even after the adsorption capacity has already been depleted the presence of organic substances dissolved and adsorbable and nutrients in the influent leads to the formation of a biofilm on the activated carbon surface çeçen and aktaş 2011 sbardella et al 2018 stewart et al 1990 due to the abundance of microorganisms substrate availability and optimal growth conditions biological processes take place in gac filters and extend the filter life span reungoat et al 2012 reungoat et al 2011 scholz and martin 1997 the performance of biofilters in general depends on contact time specific surface area that is available for biomass growth temperature biomass concentration oxygen supply and backwashing events huck and sozan ski 2008 the diversity of microorganisms in the biofilm in combination with longer sludge retention times promote the biodegradation of organic substances that are poorly or non biodegradable in a conventional activated sludge cas process of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp çeçen and aktaş 2011 reungoat et al 2011 based on long term investigations sbardella et al 2018 were able to show an increase in the removal of moderately to poorly biodegradable micropollutants for example about 25 for bezafibrate and about 32 for sulfamethoxazole compared to non biologically active filters micropollutants that have been presumed to be persistent to conventional biological processes were removed by biologically active gac filters joss et al 2006 rattier et al 2012 sbardella et al 2018 siegrist and joss 2012 the rough porous structure of the gac offers slowly growing microorganisms an optimal growth surface and protection against shear forces korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 the gac type also affects the biodegradation processes thermally activated gac shows a high potential for biodegradation due to a higher oxygen affinity yapsakli and çeçen 2010 and the fact that some micropollutants are biodegradable only under aerobic conditions joss et al 2006 it is assumed that the oxygen on the gac surface leads to a catalytic chemical reaction that transforms non biodegradable substances into biologically available substances korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 uhl 2000 the oxidation of organic substances and the consumption by microorganisms lead to a decrease of the oxygen concentration in gac filters as a result of the synergy of gac and biofilm the substrates are supplied from the liquid phase as well as from the adsorbent surface herzberg et al 2005 due to the size of bacterial cells 200 nm they are not able to penetrate into the activated carbon pores 200 nm macropores 50 nm 2 nm mesopores 50 nm klimenko et al 2003 xiaojian et al 1991 therefore biodegradation occurs mainly on the external surface of the activated carbon the formation of a biofilm can take weeks to months lazarova and manem 1995 however biological activity already starts in the early stages of biofilm formation sbardella et al 2018 while the biofilm is being formed lag phase adsorptive processes dominate the removal in the gac filters when the biofilm reaches the exponential phase both processes run parallel until the biofilm attains the stationary phase flemming 1991 simpson 2008 in the stationary phase the biological processes then dominate biofilm development and thickness can be controlled by regular backwashing so that a certain biofilm thickness is achieved and blockages are avoided korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 scholz and martin 1997 this work is the first to assess the potential to biologically remove micropollutants within full pilot scale gac filters for tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater as first step of the assessment biodegradability and adsorbability of wwtp effluent were investigated additionally the effect of the biological removal on the adsorbability was analysed for six gac filters the influence of pre treatment empty bed contact time ebct nutrient availability dissolved oxygen concentration and seasonal changes on the biofilm development and biological activity was systematically investigated this study showcases the backwashing frequency otherwise a merely operative parameter as suitable indicator for biofilm development and indirectly its activity moreover this study also gives valuable insight into the long term performance of gac filters by extensively tracking micropollutant concentrations dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and unlike other studies the concentrations of transformation products for a period of 974 days 2 material and methods 2 1 advanced wastewater treatment plant design and operation an advanced wwtp treated the effluent of a municipal wwtp in southern hesse germany for 32 months the wwtp is thoroughly described elsewhere fundneider 2020 the advanced wwtp average inflow 30 35 m³ d had two treatment stages stage one was a pre treatment stage to remove residual phosphorus and suspended solids the second stage consisted of a battery of gac filters for the removal of micropollutants fig 1 the pre treatment stage incorporated two steps a coagulation iron iii chloride and aluminium iii chloride and a solids separation step for this purpose two different separation systems were tested a cloth filtration cf mecana umwelttechnik gmbh switzerland and a membrane filtration system microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf pall corporation germany further information on the pre treatment is listed in table i

pre treated effluents effluent cf effluent of a combination of cf and mf uf effluent mf uf different gac types see table iii in the supplementary material as well as various ebcts between 6 35 min influent dissolved oxygen concentration was close to saturation in all filters the gac filters were back washed manually and bottom up using an air water mixture backwashing was initiated after reaching the maximum gac filter pressure s1 3 6 bar s2 s6 200 300 mbar following the interruption of the filtration operation the filter bed was loosened by using compressed air s1 vair 10 20 m h t 5

with water without air until the backwashing water was no longer turbid s1 vbw 4 m h t 15 30 min s2 s6 vbw 10 20 m h t 10 20 min so that the filtration could continue detailed information about the operation of the gac filters was already reported in fundneider 2020 for the filters s1 s4 and s5 dissolved oxygen concentration in both influent and effluent were determined with an online sensor oxymax cos61d endress hauser ag 2 2 sampling and chemical analyses 2 2 1 wastewater sampling an automatic sampler collected daily samples of the influent and effluent of each filter the samples were 24 h flow proportional mixed samples 24 h ms the 24 h ms were stored dark and cold in 5 l glass bottles and were used for the analyses of the conventional parameters a weekly mixed sample w ms was prepared from each of the 24 h ms these w ms were used for micropollutant analysis 2 2 2 analysis of conventional parameters and micropollutants for doc and uv254nm samples were filtered using a

laboratories fresenius university of applied sciences hsf idstein germany performed ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms of filtered samples 0 45 µm with and without pre concentration only standard analyses were performed by this laboratory an extensive collection of micropollutants was measured by the federal institute of hydrology bfg in koblenz germany they conducted high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms of non enriched filtered samples 0 45 µm the measurements were done according to the procedure described by hermes et al 2018 further information can be found in the supplementary material and fundneider 2020 2 3 quantification of biomass on the activated carbon surface for the quantification of the biomass content on the activated carbon the filter material was uniformly sampled along the filter bed the sample was filled into a 100 ml measuring cylinder with standard ground glass joint hirschmann em techcolor so that about 60 ml moist gac including biomass could be used for the analysis gac quantity was also gravimetrically quantified using a precision balance cp124s sartorius ag the measuring cylinder was then filled with 40 ml milliq water academic millipore merck and closed with a glass stopper the biomass was detached by panning the cylinder 10 times so that the mechanical stress did not lead to abrasion of the gac after about 10 20 s of sedimentation the supernatant without gac was transferred into a beaker v 500 ml duran schott prepared for the determination of the tss and vss the procedure was repeated 10 times until the supernatant looked clear to the naked eye the remaining gac was dried at 150 c and used as reference value in addition the tss at 105 c heraeus instruments drying cabinet and the vss at 550 c n11 muffle furnace naber were determined from the extracted biomass based on the analysed organic mass as well as the dry weight of 60 ml gac it was possible to indicate the specific biomass content per unit of weight or volume in moist or dried state a triplicate determination was used to calculate the specific biomass content 2 4 measurement of the biodegradability of dissolved organic substances the biological activity of the biomass in the filters as well as the biodegradable doc in the influent were determined by aerobic batch tests the biomass was extracted from the backwash water of the gac filters sieved 200 µm retsch repeatedly rinsed with drinking water or test medium and thickened to 5 g vss l filtered effluent of the wwtp 0 1 µm was used for the batch tests concentrated inoculum 0 01 0 02 ml l was added to the test medium and continuously mixed for 7 d at 20 c in a thermocabinet using a magnetic plate variomag multipoint 6 thermo scientific to ensure aerobic conditions the test medium was initially saturated with oxygen during the experiment oxygen was introduced through continuous mixing before and after the test the potential fluid loss was measured gravimetrically using a precision balance lp620p sartorius and taken into account the doc as well as scod concentration ph value sentix 950 wtw oxygen concentration fdo 925 wtw and temperature were determined using a multi 9620 ids wtw before and after the tests 2 5 adsorption analysis of doc from wwtp effluent the basis of the adsorption analysis were adsorption isotherms according to dvgw 2011 and zietzschmann et al 2018 filtered effluent from the wwtp 0 1 µm was used for this purpose the gac were pulverized universalmühle m 20 ika fractionated retsch ve 1000 and dried at 150 c the stock suspension 3 g l was prepared with gac 45 µm and milliq water academic millipore merck using a precision balance lp620p sartorius wetting and degassing was ensured by an ultrasonic treatment 15 min and a contact time of 24 h for the isotherm 200 ml of the test medium volumetric and gravimetric determined were filled into 250 ml narrow neck bottles with ptfe seal vwr and after the addition of the stock suspension 3 150 mg l n 10 mixed for 72 h at 20 c and 20 rpm in an overhead shaker typ 3040 gesellschaft für labortechnik mbh the addition of the stock suspension was carried out by eppendorf research plus and was additionally gravimetrically measured using a precision balance subsequently the samples were filtered with a membrane filter 0 45 µm polyethersulfone vwr and uv254nm and doc were analyzed based on the isotherms an adsorption analysis was performed with the software adsana version 1 5 worch 2016 to determine the freundlich coefficients k a systematic variation of the k was carried out the freundlich exponent n was set to 0 25 adsana uses the ideal adsorbed solution theory based on sontheimer et al 1988 which allows the calculation of equilibrium data from the doc concentrations and individual isothermal parameters of the mixture components after error minimization adsana delivers the percentage doc portions assigned according to the k coefficients 2 6 data processing of the gac filters for the analysis of the system the ratio c c0 between effluent c and influent c0 concentrations of micropollutants and doc was calculated the effluent concentration of the pre treatment stage was taken as influent concentration of the gac filters concentrations below the limit of quantification loq were disregarded for the influent and set to loq value for the effluent qdoc is defined as the adsorbed doc on the gac surface a mass balance for each gac filter was used for the calculation of qdoc calculated qdoc includes both adsorbed doc and biologically removed doc the removal of the filters was evaluated for individual micropollutants doc and uv254nm table iv of the supplementary material lists all the analysed micropollutants and organic sum parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological and adsorptive availability of dissolved organic substances fig 2 a displays the ratio of doc and scod concentration before and after a 7 d incubation time with biomass from gac filters it shows that a fraction of biodegradable doc bdoc of 21 5 8 2 and scod including nitrite correction of 24 2 7 2 were available for further biological processes the biodegradable fractions varied due to changes in the inoculum and in the composition of the wastewater such as nutrients or trace elements the seasonal performance of the biological stage of the wwtp also alters the biodegradable fraction in the effluent a relation between bdoc and sludge retention time srt 19 32 d of the wwtp and wastewater temperature t 11 23 c could not be established fig 2 b and c display the results of the adsorption analyses determined with adsana the fractionation and the absolute value of each of the k components is specific to the treated wastewater substances or fractions with k equal or higher than 100 mg g l mg 1 n can be considered well adsorbable in the advanced wastewater treatment the doc was divided into 5 categories according to their k sontheimer et al 1988 k ranged between 0 not adsorbable and 180 strongly adsorbable mg g l mg 1 n fig 2 b presents the average doc fractionation for the wwtp effluent over a year nsamples 7 the doc fractions did not greatly fluctuate over the evaluation period which suggests that the fractionation was independent of the seasonal variations flow concentration temperature 70 of the doc in the wwtpe was moderately adsorbable k 60 mg g l mg 1 n whereas 20 3 n 7 of the doc was non adsorbable k 0 mg g l mg 1 n in this case our results also correspond to other studies e g by benstöm 2017 metzger 2010 and zietzschmann et al 2014 their results showed a non adsorbable doc fraction of 18 25 finally fig 2 c shows doc fractions before and after the biological treatment with biomass from gac filters see section 2 4 this treatment affected primarily the well and strongly adsorbable doc fractions k 100 k 180 mg g l mg 1 n those fractions were reduced by approximately 35 and transferred to the moderately adsorbable doc fraction k 60 mg g l mg 1 n no change in the non and poorly adsorbable doc fractions k 0 mg g l mg 1 n k 20 mg g l mg 1 n was observed it can be assumed that the occurrence of biological processes led to a reduction in the competition between micropollutants and the well and strongly adsorbable doc fractions 3 2 influence of the pre treatment on biofilm growth all the pre treatment technologies successfully achieved low levels of suspended solids tss 2 mg l and turbidity 1 fnu fundneider et al 2020 however mf uf were more efficient in removing them due to their membrane cut off of 0 1 µm 0 01 µm respectively despite the difference in the suspended solids removal nutrients and doc remained the same after all pre treatment technologies the influence of the suspended solids on the gac filters was thus negligible regardless of the pre treatment all gac filters had to be backwashed after a certain time of operation the need of backwashing arose from the biomass growth happening on the external activated carbon surface while the gac type with the same grain size did not affect the backwashing frequency the pre treatment played an important role the gac filter s6 with an mf pre treatment required its first pressure triggered backwashing after 122 d whereas the first backwashing for the gac filters s4 and s5 with cf pre treatment happened after only 21 d notably the gac filters s2 and s3 with a mixed influent cf mf needed their first backwashing also after only 21 d our results show that the membrane based pre treatment led to a backwashing frequency of 0 1 1 week in comparison the cf pre treatment had a backwashing frequency of 1 2 1 week due to the difference in filter geometries as well as the rapid biomass attachment and growth in the upper zone of the pilot scale gac filters s1 a transfer of the results from pilot scale to full scale gac filters is only possible to a limited extent 3 3 biomass content in gac filters in all filters biofilm growth on the gac surface was detected it has already been demonstrated that macropores 200 nm nm are an adequate niche for biofilm formation wright et al 1995 the biomass enclosed in the gac macropores makes up for the majority of the total biomass and is only slightly removed through backwashing figure i in the supplementary material illustrates the colonization of the macropores a backwashing event removes only the portion of the biomass that accumulates on the outer layer of the biofilm and in the spaces of the gac bed we measured that each backwashing event in the full scale gac filter s1 removed less than 10 of the total biomass although the specific surface area of pores accessible to microorganisms accounts for less than 1 of the total surface gac offers a surface close to 10 times larger than the surface of other filter media such as sand or anthracite knezev 2015 our results suggest a fast colonization of the activated carbon surface with microorganisms substances that were not eliminated in the wwtp started to be removed by the gac filters in early operation stages for instance fig 3 exhibits that gabapentin gpt was fully removed by sorption until day 30 when breakthrough took place afterwards removal remained constant at approximately 60 until the end of the operation biological processes probably caused the flattening out of the gpt s breakthrough curve additionally the sustained removal of a poorly adsorbable micropollutant also points towards an already well established biofilm in all filters the vss concentration decreased along the filter depth for example in the full scale gac filter s1 with a filter bed of 4 m the total biomass content reached 3 5 1 4 kg vss m³gac n 24 in the stationary phase t operation 652 d however biomass was not evenly distributed along the bed in the first layer 0 1 m a biomass content of 5 3 0 5 kg vss m³gac was measured the second layer 1 2 5 m had a biomass content of 3 2 0 4 kg vss m³gac and finally the third layer 2 5 4 m had a biomass content of 2 0 0 2 kg vss m³gac figure i in the supplementary material shows images of the gac at different depths of the filter bed for the activated carbon used in the filter s1 652 d and for fresh carbon in the pilot scale gac filters s2 a lower biomass content of 0 65 0 13 kg vss m³gac was measured in the stationary phase toperation 974 d the biomass content in the pilot scale filters was lower than the biomass content in the full scale filters the different backwashing methods and intensities used for the pilot scale and full scale filters caused such differences in the biomass content see section 2 1 3 4 impact of the influent quality on biological activity monitoring the backwashing frequency and the vss content in the backwashing water allowed us to track the biofilm development on the gac surface a direct relationship between backwashing events nutrients content in the influent and oxygen concentration in both influent and effluent was identified fig 3 a shows wastewater temperature and oxygen concentration in the influent o2 in and effluent o2 eff of the full scale gac filter s1 the average oxygen concentrations in the influent and effluent were 7 3 0 7 mg l n 314 and 2 3 1 1 mg l n 323 respectively which indicates that oxygen was consumed within the gac filter this oxygen consumption is caused by biological processes and also by the interaction between oxygen and the gac surface prober et al 1975 the oxygen on the gac surface is able to oxidize the already adsorbed substances and probably to modify the interactions between the gac and the biofilm hubele 1985 jin et al 2013 the oxygen consumption along the filter bed was also measured in the pilot scale gac filters figure ii in the supplementary material at high temperatures 25 c and or low o2 in concentrations the bottom zone of the gac filter presented low oxygen levels 1 mg l which indicates occasional occurrence of anoxic conditions at t 20 c more that 80 of the oxygen was consumed in the filter whereas at t 15 c only 50 of the oxygen was depleted in the respective temperature range the biological removal is highly sensitive to temperature changes at high temperatures faster growth and more substrate consumption in the biofilm is expected the increased oxygen consumption could thus be mainly attributed to the increased biological activity after each backwashing event oxygen consumption o2 in o2 eff decreased however biodegradation remained the same than before the backwashing event fig 3 b shows the doc concentration in the influent and effluent with increasing time the adsorption capacity decreased and the primary mechanism for the removal of organic substances was biodegradation rather than adsorption the c c0 curve behaved typically for a gac filter roberts and summers 1982 sontheimer et al 1988 zietzschmann et al 2016 three phases were distinguished in the first one the removal was dominated by adsorption 0 100 d in the second phase 100 350 d biodegradation and adsorptive removal overlapped and finally in the third phase 350 d biodegradation dominated as described in section 3 1 the lab scale experiments revealed bdoc fractions close to 20 and similar results were found for the full scale filters s1 in the third phase c c0 remained constant around 0 8 confirming a bdoc fraction of approximately 20 fig 3 c and d show nutrient concentrations in the influent srp nh4 n and no2 n between operating days 370 420 peak concentrations of nh4 n 5 mg l and no2 n 0 7 mg l appeared during this period backwashing events became more frequent see fig 3 d pointing to an acceleration in microbial growth our results suggest that in contrast to nh4 n and no2 n srp was not removed and did not affect the microbial growth when srp concentrations peaked no change in the backwashing frequency was observed likewise influent srp concentrations of 0 05 mg l did not limit the biomass growth according to liu et al 2001 a nutrient ratio doc nh4 n srp close to 20 5 1 is optimal for biofilm growth at operation days close to 300 400 and 500 a nearly optimal doc nh4 n srp ratio was reached during those periods the vss load in the backwashing water rose see fig 3 d and e which indicates an acceleration in the biofilm growth the vss content of the effluent however remained under 1 fnu during the whole operation period fig 3 e illustrates the vss load measured for each backwashing event for our filters the backwashing events on average were 2 to 6 times less frequent 14 20 d than reported by kårelid et al 2017 merkel et al 2015 and knopp et al 2016 figure iii in the supplementary material finally fig 3 e also shows the removal of gpt and 4faa gpt poorly adsorbable and biodegradable which have broken through after 40 50 d afterwards c c0 fluctuated between 0 3 and 0 4 due to the constant biologically removal due to dilution effects under rainy weather conditions q qmax 0 4 in fig 3 c c c0 was higher than 0 4 reungoat et al 2011 and sperlich et al 2017 also observed removal of gpt in gac filters in the experiments for the treatment of drinking water of sperlich et al 2017 40 of gpt was removed under aerobic conditions o2 7 4 mg l with an ebct 30 min whereas with an ebct 15 min only 20 was removed 4faa moderately adsorbable showed a similar behaviour to gpt although the removal of gpt and 4faa is driven mainly by biodegradation it varied only slightly with temperature due to the complex microbial community and its variability filters with the same effluent and ebct but with different geometries and vf table ii in the supplementary material still presented differences in the individual removal of some micropollutants figure iv in the supplementary material for instance the gac filter s1 removed dcf or 4faa better than gac filter s2 3 5 influence of empty bed contact time temperature and dilution on adsorptive and biological removal previous studies have shown that ebct is a key for the design and operation of gac filters the sorption capacity of the activated carbon can be best utilized by operating the filters at ebcts close to 20 to 30 min ebcts longer than those have been reported to be non advantageous for the adsorptive removal fundneider 2020 nevertheless long ebcts influence substrate uptake fostering the biological removal of micropollutants terry and summers 2018 fig 4 shows the influence of ebct on the removal levels of a 4faa b gpt c tmd and d oxipurinol opn our results show that qdoc did not increase for ebct 20 regardless of the micropollutant properties in terms of adsorbability and biodegradability alongside the ebct temperature had an effect on the biological removal in the case of the known biodegradable substances 4faa altmann et al 2016 ruhl et al 2014 and gpt henning et al 2018 sperlich et al 2017 a better removal was observed at high temperatures the breakthrough curve of 4faa in fig 4 a clearly illustrates this effect for example for an ebct 16 min and at approximately 12 c the relative removal was 0 5 q 155 mgdoc ggac once the temperature reached 20 c the c c0 decreased down to 0 1 q 196 mgdoc ggac this behaviour was also recognized for gpt as displayed in fig 4 b for tmp as non biodegradable micropollutant rattier et al 2012 a similar effect as for 4faa and gpt was found we hypothesize that biodegradation shifted the competition for adsorption sites between doc and micropollutants and that this shift may have indirectly improved the adsorptive removal of some non biodegradable micropollutants such as tmp finally for opn a non biodegradable micropollutant funke et al 2015 sperlich et al 2017 no impact of the temperature was visible fig 5 shows the influence of changing the ebct on the breakthrough of selected micropollutants over the bv increasing the ebct to 20 min after a long period of operation with an ebct 20 min can enhance the utilization of activated carbon capacity fig 5 c and d display that at about 25 000 bv and onwards the ebct continuously increased to final values between 30 and 40 min the breakthrough curves of several individual micropollutants illustrate the effect of increasing the ebct on their removal the ebct impacted both adsorptive and biological removal for pmd moderately adsorbable and non biodegradable and cbz well adsorbable and non biodegradable the removal improved after increasing the ebct in the case of 4faa and dcf the overlapping of adsorptive and biological processes was recognized for both micropollutants at bv 15 000 m³ m³ after the adsorptive removal stopped c c0 started decreasing which marked the beginning of the biologically dominated removal on the one hand for 4faa after the biodegradation started c c0 dropped from 0 5 to nearly zero demonstrating the dominating role of the biodegradation on its removal for dcf the production of the transformation products 4h dcf and c dcf provided a clear indication of biological removal fig 5 d shows the breakthrough curves of the dfc transformation products from about bv 15 000 m³ m³ the c c0 of 4h dcf and c dcf was higher than 1 which points to the biological production of such substances within the biofilm an additional factor that visibly affected the gac filters performance was the dilution of the influent due to rainy weather conditions in fig 5 b the ratio q qmax illustrates the influent dilution dynamics dilution causes an inversion of the concentration gradient between influent low concentrations and the activated carbon high concentrations hence when a diluted influent comes into the gac filter desorption is likely to take place and the removal of the micropollutants may be affected increase in c c0 for instance at approximately bv 30 000 m³ m³ an unusual increment in the c c0 of pmd and cbz occurred which was attributed to the sustained dilution that the system experienced during this period q qmax of nearly 1 3 6 long term performance of the micropollutant removal prerequisites for a successful gac process are a suitable pre treatment stage removal of phosphorus and suspended solids and the correct selection of the activated carbon type additionally an adequate ebct 20 min and a developed biofilm contribute to the optimal utilization of the gac adsorption capacity the long term performance data from gac filter s2 which was operated under such conditions was selected as the example hydraffin ar ebct 24 2 1 8 min toperation 974d fig 6 a shows the breakthrough behaviour of two non biodegradable substances pmd and cbz that differ in their adsorbability for cbz the effluent concentration remained below the loq until approximately bv 17 000 m³ m³ whereas for pmd breakthrough started at approximately bv 5 500 m³ m³ after breakthrough the effluent concentrations increased constantly which verified their non biodegradability fig 6 b displays the breakthrough behaviour of two biodegradable and well adsorbable substances metoprolol met and amisulpride asp met breakthrough started at bv 20 000 m³ m³ from bv 25 000 m³ m³ onwards c c0 fluctuated between 0 1 0 2 due to biodegradation for asp effluent concentrations were below the loq until the end of the operation period approximately bv 45 000 m³ m³ this indicates the constant removal of asp due to both biological and or adsorptive processes the extent to which each process contributed to the removal could not be clearly differentiated lastly fig 6 c shows the breakthrough behaviour for opn and tmd as non biodegradable substances although these two substances are considered in the literature as non biodegradable the observed breakthrough behaviour of both substances suggests that biological processes might have taken part in their removal with our data however we cannot fully explain the specific influence that biodegradation had on the removal of opn and tmd fig 6 d shows the relationship between treated bv carbon usage rate cur and qdoc at the end of the operation period qdoc was higher than the expected equilibrium capacity qe 140 180 mgdoc mggac for doc0 4 1 6 6 mg l the q surplus can be explained by the biologically removed doc moreover it accounted for 25 42 of the total qdoc although the microbial colonisation of the gac surface is likely to cause pore blockages we were able to prove that biofilm growth on gac did not affect removal of micropollutants and on the contrary it fostered their removal to achieve a c c0 0 2 a single gac filter had a cur between 8 19 mg l cur is specific to each micropollutant and for our system it can be ranked as follows asp met tmd cbz the required cur was comparable and even lower than the cur of similar pac systems as reported by böhler et al 2012 and rizzo et al 2019 parallel operation of several filters can improve the utilisation of the carbon capacity section 3 5 for the same gac filter s2 breakthrough behaviour of 12 other micropollutants uv254nm and doc is included in the supplementary material 4 conclusions gac filters contribute to reaching high quality effluents in this study the long term performance of gac filters and their biological activity was monitored the occurrence of biological processes that improved the micropollutant removal was evident from our results the conclusions were both lab and pilot scale experiments showed that the bdoc in the effluent of the wwtp accounted for 20 of the total doc similarly adsorption analyses showed that the non absorbable doc fraction accounted for 20 of the total doc biodegradation changed the distribution of the adsorbable doc fractions reducing the competition between micropollutants and well adsorbable doc fractions k 100 mg g l mg 1 n the early start of the removal of moderately adsorbable and otherwise poorly biodegradable substances such as gpt suggested a fast colonisation of the gac surface by specialized bacteria backwashing was necessary to control the biofilm growth in the gac filters depending on the pre treatment the frequency of the backwashing events changed we observed backwashing frequencies of 0 1 1 week for filters operated with a membrane pre treatment and 1 2 1 week for filters operated with cf wastewater temperature and nutrient concentrations also influenced the backwashing frequency backwashing did not affect the effluent quality optimal operation conditions in combination with a developed biofilm led to a better utilization of the adsorption capacity the curs of gac filters were comparable to or even lower than those from pac applications in terms of qdoc biological removal extended the life span of the filters by approximately 25 42 declaration of

17351,granulated activated carbon gac filtration is a common process for advanced wastewater treatment in such filters the removal of organic substances results from adsorptive as well as biological processes this work investigated the potential of biological processes and their influence on gac filter performance during 32 months the removal of micropollutants dissolved organic carbon doc and the spectral absorption coefficient was monitored in six gac filters the effects of pre treatment cloth and or membrane filtration ebct from 6 35 min and gac type were evaluated likewise the impact of the influent s fluctuations in temperature flow and concentration ammonia nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus srp were analysed biological processes were tracked by the frequency of backwashing oxygen consumption removal of poorly absorbable micropollutants and production of transformation products pre treatment influenced biofilm growth significantly membrane filtration delayed the first backwashing event by 122 d in comparison to cloth filtration where the first backwash was conducted after only 21 d removal of poorly absorbable substances was observed early on 40 50 d parallel operation contributed to a better utilisation of the gac capacity and the biological removal potential influent nitrogen species 0 5 mg n l promoted biofilm growth whereas srp seemed to have no effect the developed biofilm and optimal operating conditions led to longer life spans of the gac filters making carbon usage rates comparable to those from pac applications the results suggest that biological processes accounted for about 25 42 of the totally removed doc at the end of the operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated carbon filtration adsorption biodegradation empty bed contact time ebct micropollutants tertiary treatment 1 introduction the adsorption capacity of granulated activated carbon gac filters decreases with increasing operation time if biological activity is present within the gac filter organic substances are further removed even after the adsorption capacity has already been depleted the presence of organic substances dissolved and adsorbable and nutrients in the influent leads to the formation of a biofilm on the activated carbon surface çeçen and aktaş 2011 sbardella et al 2018 stewart et al 1990 due to the abundance of microorganisms substrate availability and optimal growth conditions biological processes take place in gac filters and extend the filter life span reungoat et al 2012 reungoat et al 2011 scholz and martin 1997 the performance of biofilters in general depends on contact time specific surface area that is available for biomass growth temperature biomass concentration oxygen supply and backwashing events huck and sozan ski 2008 the diversity of microorganisms in the biofilm in combination with longer sludge retention times promote the biodegradation of organic substances that are poorly or non biodegradable in a conventional activated sludge cas process of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp çeçen and aktaş 2011 reungoat et al 2011 based on long term investigations sbardella et al 2018 were able to show an increase in the removal of moderately to poorly biodegradable micropollutants for example about 25 for bezafibrate and about 32 for sulfamethoxazole compared to non biologically active filters micropollutants that have been presumed to be persistent to conventional biological processes were removed by biologically active gac filters joss et al 2006 rattier et al 2012 sbardella et al 2018 siegrist and joss 2012 the rough porous structure of the gac offers slowly growing microorganisms an optimal growth surface and protection against shear forces korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 the gac type also affects the biodegradation processes thermally activated gac shows a high potential for biodegradation due to a higher oxygen affinity yapsakli and çeçen 2010 and the fact that some micropollutants are biodegradable only under aerobic conditions joss et al 2006 it is assumed that the oxygen on the gac surface leads to a catalytic chemical reaction that transforms non biodegradable substances into biologically available substances korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 uhl 2000 the oxidation of organic substances and the consumption by microorganisms lead to a decrease of the oxygen concentration in gac filters as a result of the synergy of gac and biofilm the substrates are supplied from the liquid phase as well as from the adsorbent surface herzberg et al 2005 due to the size of bacterial cells 200 nm they are not able to penetrate into the activated carbon pores 200 nm macropores 50 nm 2 nm mesopores 50 nm klimenko et al 2003 xiaojian et al 1991 therefore biodegradation occurs mainly on the external surface of the activated carbon the formation of a biofilm can take weeks to months lazarova and manem 1995 however biological activity already starts in the early stages of biofilm formation sbardella et al 2018 while the biofilm is being formed lag phase adsorptive processes dominate the removal in the gac filters when the biofilm reaches the exponential phase both processes run parallel until the biofilm attains the stationary phase flemming 1991 simpson 2008 in the stationary phase the biological processes then dominate biofilm development and thickness can be controlled by regular backwashing so that a certain biofilm thickness is achieved and blockages are avoided korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 scholz and martin 1997 this work is the first to assess the potential to biologically remove micropollutants within full pilot scale gac filters for tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater as first step of the assessment biodegradability and adsorbability of wwtp effluent were investigated additionally the effect of the biological removal on the adsorbability was analysed for six gac filters the influence of pre treatment empty bed contact time ebct nutrient availability dissolved oxygen concentration and seasonal changes on the biofilm development and biological activity was systematically investigated this study showcases the backwashing frequency otherwise a merely operative parameter as suitable indicator for biofilm development and indirectly its activity moreover this study also gives valuable insight into the long term performance of gac filters by extensively tracking micropollutant concentrations dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and unlike other studies the concentrations of transformation products for a period of 974 days 2 material and methods 2 1 advanced wastewater treatment plant design and operation an advanced wwtp treated the effluent of a municipal wwtp in southern hesse germany for 32 months the wwtp is thoroughly described elsewhere fundneider 2020 the advanced wwtp average inflow 30 35 m³ d had two treatment stages stage one was a pre treatment stage to remove residual phosphorus and suspended solids the second stage consisted of a battery of gac filters for the removal of micropollutants fig 1 the pre treatment stage incorporated two steps a coagulation iron iii chloride and aluminium iii chloride and a solids separation step for this purpose two different separation systems were tested a cloth filtration cf mecana umwelttechnik gmbh switzerland and a membrane filtration system microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf pall corporation germany further information on the pre treatment is listed in table i

pre treated effluents effluent cf effluent of a combination of cf and mf uf effluent mf uf different gac types see table iii in the supplementary material as well as various ebcts between 6 35 min influent dissolved oxygen concentration was close to saturation in all filters the gac filters were back washed manually and bottom up using an air water mixture backwashing was initiated after reaching the maximum gac filter pressure s1 3 6 bar s2 s6 200 300 mbar following the interruption of the filtration operation the filter bed was loosened by using compressed air s1 vair 10 20 m h t 5

with water without air until the backwashing water was no longer turbid s1 vbw 4 m h t 15 30 min s2 s6 vbw 10 20 m h t 10 20 min so that the filtration could continue detailed information about the operation of the gac filters was already reported in fundneider 2020 for the filters s1 s4 and s5 dissolved oxygen concentration in both influent and effluent were determined with an online sensor oxymax cos61d endress hauser ag 2 2 sampling and chemical analyses 2 2 1 wastewater sampling an automatic sampler collected daily samples of the influent and effluent of each filter the samples were

prepared from each of the 24 h ms these w ms were used for micropollutant analysis 2 2 2 analysis of conventional parameters and micropollutants for doc and uv254nm samples were filtered using a

hermes et al 2018 further information can be found in the supplementary material and fundneider 2020 2 3 quantification of biomass on the activated carbon surface for the quantification of the biomass content on the activated carbon the filter material was uniformly sampled along the filter bed the sample was filled into a 100 ml measuring cylinder with standard ground glass joint hirschmann em techcolor so that about 60 ml moist gac including biomass could be used for the analysis gac quantity was also gravimetrically quantified using a precision balance cp124s sartorius ag the measuring cylinder was then filled with 40 ml milliq water academic millipore merck and closed with a glass stopper the biomass was detached by panning the cylinder 10 times so that the mechanical stress did not lead to abrasion of the gac after about 10 20 s of sedimentation the supernatant without gac was transferred into a beaker v 500 ml duran schott prepared for the determination of the tss and vss the procedure was repeated 10 times until the supernatant looked clear to the naked eye the remaining gac was dried at 150 c and used as reference value in addition the tss at 105 c heraeus instruments drying cabinet and the vss at 550 c n11 muffle furnace naber were determined from the extracted biomass based on the analysed organic mass as well as the dry weight of 60 ml gac it was possible to indicate the specific biomass content per unit of weight or volume in moist or dried state a triplicate determination was used to calculate the specific biomass content 2 4 measurement of the biodegradability of dissolved organic substances the biological activity of the biomass in the filters as well as the biodegradable doc in the influent were determined by aerobic batch tests the biomass was extracted from the backwash water of the gac filters sieved 200 µm retsch repeatedly rinsed with drinking water or test medium and thickened to 5 g vss l filtered effluent of the wwtp 0 1

thermo scientific to ensure aerobic conditions the test medium was initially saturated with oxygen during the experiment oxygen was introduced through continuous mixing before and after the test the potential fluid loss was measured gravimetrically using a precision balance lp620p sartorius and taken into account the doc as well as scod concentration ph value sentix 950 wtw oxygen concentration fdo 925 wtw and temperature were determined using a multi 9620 ids wtw before and after the tests 2 5 adsorption analysis of doc from wwtp effluent the basis of the adsorption analysis were adsorption isotherms according to dvgw 2011 and zietzschmann et al 2018 filtered effluent from the wwtp 0 1 µm was used for this purpose the gac were pulverized universalmühle m 20 ika fractionated retsch ve 1000 and dried at 150 c the stock suspension 3 g l was prepared with gac 45 µm and milliq water academic millipore merck using a precision balance lp620p sartorius wetting and degassing was ensured by an ultrasonic treatment 15 min and a contact time of 24 h for the isotherm 200 ml of the test medium volumetric and gravimetric determined were filled into 250 ml narrow neck bottles with ptfe seal vwr and after the addition of the stock suspension 3 150 mg l n 10 mixed for 72 h at 20 c and 20 rpm in an overhead shaker typ 3040 gesellschaft für labortechnik mbh the addition of the stock suspension was carried out by eppendorf research plus and was additionally gravimetrically measured using a precision balance subsequently the samples were filtered with a membrane filter 0 45 µm polyethersulfone vwr and uv254nm and doc were analyzed based on the isotherms an adsorption analysis was performed with the software adsana version 1 5 worch 2016 to determine the freundlich coefficients k a systematic variation of the k was carried out the freundlich exponent n was set to 0 25 adsana uses the ideal adsorbed solution theory based on sontheimer et al 1988 which allows the calculation of equilibrium data from the doc concentrations and individual isothermal parameters of the mixture components after error minimization adsana delivers the percentage doc portions assigned according to the k coefficients 2 6 data processing of the gac filters for the analysis of the system the ratio c c0 between effluent c and influent c0 concentrations of micropollutants and doc was calculated the effluent concentration of the pre treatment stage was taken as influent concentration of the gac filters concentrations below the limit of quantification loq were disregarded for the influent and set to loq value for the effluent qdoc is defined as the adsorbed doc on the gac surface a mass balance for each gac filter was used for the calculation of qdoc calculated qdoc includes both adsorbed doc and biologically removed doc the removal of the filters was evaluated for individual micropollutants doc and uv254nm table iv of the supplementary material lists all the analysed micropollutants and organic sum parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological and adsorptive availability of dissolved organic substances fig 2 a displays the ratio of doc and scod concentration before and after a 7 d incubation time with biomass from gac filters it shows that a fraction of biodegradable doc bdoc of 21 5 8 2 and scod including nitrite correction of 24 2 7 2 were available for further biological processes the biodegradable fractions varied due to changes in the inoculum and in the composition of the wastewater such as nutrients or trace elements the seasonal performance of the biological stage of the wwtp also alters the biodegradable fraction in the effluent a relation between bdoc and sludge retention time srt 19 32 d of the wwtp and wastewater temperature t 11 23 c could not be established fig 2 b and c display the results of the adsorption analyses determined with adsana the fractionation and the absolute value of each of the k components is specific to the treated wastewater substances or fractions with k equal or higher than 100 mg g l mg 1 n can be considered well adsorbable in the advanced wastewater treatment the doc was divided into 5 categories according to their k sontheimer et al 1988 k ranged between 0 not adsorbable and 180 strongly adsorbable mg g l mg 1 n fig 2 b presents the average doc fractionation for the wwtp effluent over a year nsamples 7 the doc fractions did not greatly fluctuate over the evaluation period which suggests that the fractionation was independent of the seasonal variations flow concentration temperature 70 of the doc in the wwtpe was moderately adsorbable k 60 mg g l mg 1 n whereas 20 3 n 7 of the doc was non adsorbable k 0 mg g l mg 1 n in this case our results also correspond to other studies e g by benstöm 2017 metzger 2010 and zietzschmann et al 2014 their results showed a non adsorbable doc fraction of 18 25 finally fig 2 c shows doc fractions before and after the biological treatment with biomass from gac filters see section 2 4 this treatment affected primarily the well and strongly adsorbable doc fractions k 100 k 180 mg g l mg 1 n those fractions were reduced by approximately 35 and transferred to the moderately adsorbable doc fraction k 60 mg g l mg 1 n no change in the non and poorly adsorbable doc fractions k 0 mg g l mg 1 n k 20 mg g l mg 1 n was observed it can be assumed that the occurrence of biological processes led to a reduction in the competition between micropollutants and the well and strongly adsorbable doc fractions 3 2 influence of the pre treatment on biofilm growth all the pre treatment technologies successfully achieved low levels of suspended solids tss 2 mg l and turbidity 1 fnu fundneider et al 2020 however mf uf were more efficient in removing them due to their membrane cut off of 0 1 µm 0 01 µm respectively despite the difference in the suspended solids removal nutrients and doc remained the same after all pre treatment technologies the influence of the suspended solids on the gac filters was thus negligible regardless of the pre treatment all gac filters had to be backwashed after a certain time of operation the need of backwashing arose from the biomass growth happening on the external activated carbon surface while the gac type with the same grain size did not affect the backwashing frequency the pre treatment played an important role the gac filter s6 with an mf pre treatment required its first pressure triggered backwashing after 122 d whereas the first backwashing for the gac filters s4 and s5 with cf pre treatment happened after only 21 d notably the gac filters s2 and s3 with a mixed influent cf mf needed their first backwashing also after only 21 d our results show that the membrane based pre treatment led to a backwashing frequency of 0 1 1 week in comparison the cf pre treatment had a backwashing frequency of 1 2 1 week due to the difference in filter geometries as well as the rapid biomass attachment and growth in the upper zone of the pilot scale gac filters s1 a transfer of the results from pilot scale to full scale gac filters is only possible to a limited extent 3 3 biomass content in gac filters in all filters biofilm growth on the gac surface was detected it has already been demonstrated that macropores 200 nm nm are an adequate niche for biofilm formation wright et al 1995 the biomass enclosed in the gac macropores makes up for the majority of the total biomass and is only slightly removed through backwashing figure i in the supplementary material illustrates the colonization of the macropores a backwashing event removes only the portion of the biomass that accumulates on the outer layer of the biofilm and in the spaces of the gac bed we measured that each backwashing event in the full scale gac filter s1 removed less than 10 of the total biomass although the specific surface area of pores accessible to microorganisms accounts for less than 1 of the total surface gac offers a surface close to 10 times larger than the surface of other filter media such as sand or anthracite knezev 2015 our results suggest a fast colonization of the activated carbon surface with microorganisms substances that were not eliminated in the wwtp started to be removed by the gac filters in early operation stages for instance fig 3 exhibits that gabapentin gpt was fully removed by sorption until day 30 when breakthrough took place afterwards removal remained constant at approximately 60 until the end of the operation biological processes probably caused the flattening out of the gpt s breakthrough curve additionally the sustained removal of a poorly adsorbable micropollutant also points towards an already well established biofilm in all filters the vss concentration decreased along the filter depth for example in the full scale gac filter s1 with a filter bed of 4 m the total biomass content reached 3 5 1 4 kg vss m³gac n 24 in the stationary phase t operation 652 d however biomass was not evenly distributed along the bed in the first layer 0 1 m a biomass content of 5 3 0 5 kg vss m³gac was measured the second layer 1 2 5 m had a biomass content of 3 2 0 4 kg vss m³gac and finally the third layer 2 5 4 m had a biomass content of 2 0 0 2 kg vss m³gac figure i in the supplementary material shows images of the gac at different depths of the filter bed for the activated carbon used in the filter s1 652 d and for fresh carbon in the pilot scale gac filters s2 a lower biomass content of 0 65 0 13 kg vss m³gac was measured in the stationary phase toperation 974 d the biomass content in the pilot scale filters was lower than the biomass content in the full scale filters the different backwashing methods and intensities used for the pilot scale and full scale filters caused such differences in the biomass content see section 2 1 3 4 impact of the influent quality on biological activity monitoring the backwashing frequency and the vss content in the backwashing water allowed us to track the biofilm development on the gac surface a direct relationship between backwashing events nutrients content in the influent and oxygen concentration in both influent and effluent was identified fig 3 a shows wastewater temperature and oxygen concentration in the influent o2 in and effluent o2 eff of the full scale gac filter s1 the average oxygen concentrations in the influent and effluent were 7 3 0 7 mg l n 314 and 2 3 1 1 mg l n 323 respectively which indicates that oxygen was consumed within the gac filter this oxygen consumption is caused by biological processes and also by the interaction between oxygen and the gac surface prober et al 1975 the oxygen on the gac surface is able to oxidize the already adsorbed substances and probably to modify the interactions between the gac and the biofilm hubele 1985 jin et al 2013 the oxygen consumption along the filter bed was also measured in the pilot scale gac filters figure ii in the supplementary material at high temperatures 25 c and or low o2 in concentrations the bottom zone of the gac filter presented low oxygen levels 1 mg l which indicates occasional occurrence of anoxic conditions at t 20 c more that 80 of the oxygen was consumed in the filter whereas at t 15 c only 50 of the oxygen was depleted in the respective temperature range the biological removal is highly sensitive to temperature changes at high temperatures faster growth and more substrate consumption in the biofilm is expected the increased oxygen consumption could thus be mainly attributed to the increased biological activity after each backwashing event oxygen consumption o2 in o2 eff decreased however biodegradation remained the same than before the backwashing event fig 3 b shows the doc concentration in the influent and effluent with increasing time the adsorption capacity decreased and the primary mechanism for the removal of organic substances was biodegradation rather than adsorption the c c0 curve behaved typically for a gac filter roberts and summers 1982 sontheimer et al 1988 zietzschmann et al 2016 three phases were distinguished in the first one the removal was dominated by adsorption 0 100 d in the second phase 100 350 d biodegradation and adsorptive removal overlapped and finally in the third phase 350 d biodegradation dominated as described in section 3 1 the lab scale experiments revealed bdoc fractions close to 20 and similar results were found for the full scale filters s1 in the third phase c c0 remained constant around 0 8 confirming a bdoc fraction of approximately 20 fig 3 c and d show nutrient concentrations in the influent srp nh4 n and no2 n between operating days 370 420 peak concentrations of nh4 n 5 mg l and no2 n 0 7 mg l appeared during this period backwashing events became more frequent see fig 3 d pointing to an acceleration in microbial growth our results suggest that in contrast to nh4 n and no2 n srp was not removed and did not affect the microbial growth when srp concentrations peaked no change in the backwashing frequency was observed likewise influent srp concentrations of 0 05 mg l did not limit the biomass growth according to liu et al 2001 a nutrient ratio doc nh4 n srp close to 20 5 1 is optimal for biofilm growth at operation days close to 300 400 and 500 a nearly optimal doc nh4 n srp ratio was reached during those periods the vss load in the backwashing water rose see fig 3 d and e which indicates an acceleration in the biofilm growth the vss content of the effluent however remained under 1 fnu during the whole operation period fig 3 e illustrates the vss load measured for each backwashing event for our filters the backwashing events on average were 2 to 6 times less frequent 14 20 d than reported by kårelid et al 2017 merkel et al 2015 and knopp et al 2016 figure iii in the supplementary material finally fig 3 e also shows the removal of gpt and 4faa gpt poorly adsorbable and biodegradable which have broken through after 40 50 d afterwards c c0 fluctuated between 0 3 and 0 4 due to the constant biologically removal due to dilution effects under rainy weather conditions q qmax 0 4 in fig 3 c c c0 was higher than 0 4 reungoat et al 2011 and sperlich et al 2017 also observed removal of gpt in gac filters in the experiments for the treatment of drinking water of sperlich et al 2017 40 of gpt was removed under aerobic conditions o2 7 4 mg l with an ebct 30 min whereas with an ebct 15 min only 20 was removed 4faa moderately adsorbable showed a similar behaviour to gpt although the removal of gpt and 4faa is driven mainly by biodegradation it varied only slightly with temperature due to the complex microbial community and its variability filters with the same effluent and ebct but with different geometries and vf table ii in the supplementary material still presented differences in the individual removal of some micropollutants figure iv in the supplementary material for instance the gac filter s1 removed dcf or 4faa better than gac filter s2 3 5 influence of empty bed contact time temperature and dilution on adsorptive and biological removal previous studies have shown that ebct is a key for the design and operation of gac filters the sorption capacity of the activated carbon can be best utilized by operating the filters at ebcts close to 20 to 30 min ebcts longer than those have been reported to be non advantageous for the adsorptive removal fundneider 2020 nevertheless long ebcts influence substrate uptake fostering the biological removal of micropollutants terry and summers 2018 fig 4 shows the influence of ebct on the removal levels of a 4faa b gpt c tmd and d oxipurinol opn our results show that qdoc did not increase for ebct 20 regardless of the micropollutant properties in terms of adsorbability and biodegradability alongside the ebct temperature had an effect on the biological removal in the case of the known biodegradable substances 4faa altmann et al 2016 ruhl et al 2014 and gpt henning et al 2018 sperlich et al 2017 a better removal was observed at high temperatures the breakthrough curve of 4faa in fig 4 a clearly illustrates this effect for example for an ebct 16 min and at approximately 12 c the relative removal was 0 5 q 155 mgdoc ggac once the temperature reached 20 c the c c0 decreased down to 0 1 q 196 mgdoc ggac this behaviour was also recognized for gpt as displayed in fig 4 b for tmp as non biodegradable micropollutant rattier et al 2012 a similar effect as for 4faa and gpt was found we hypothesize that biodegradation shifted the competition for adsorption sites between doc and micropollutants and that this shift may have indirectly improved the adsorptive removal of some non biodegradable micropollutants such as tmp finally for opn a non biodegradable micropollutant funke et al 2015 sperlich et al 2017 no impact of the temperature was visible fig 5 shows the influence of changing the ebct on the breakthrough of selected micropollutants over the bv increasing the ebct to 20 min after a long period of operation with an ebct 20 min can enhance the utilization of activated carbon capacity fig 5 c and d display that at about 25 000 bv and onwards the ebct continuously increased to final values between 30 and 40 min the breakthrough curves of several individual micropollutants illustrate the effect of increasing the ebct on their removal the ebct impacted both adsorptive and biological removal for pmd moderately adsorbable and non biodegradable and cbz well adsorbable and non biodegradable the removal improved after increasing the ebct in the case of 4faa and dcf the overlapping of adsorptive and biological processes was recognized for both micropollutants at bv 15 000 m³ m³ after the adsorptive removal stopped c c0 started decreasing which marked the beginning of the biologically dominated removal on the one hand for 4faa after the biodegradation started c c0 dropped from 0 5 to nearly zero demonstrating the dominating role of the biodegradation on its removal for dcf the production of the transformation products 4h dcf and c dcf provided a clear indication of biological removal fig 5 d shows the breakthrough curves of the dfc transformation products from about bv 15 000 m³ m³ the c c0 of 4h dcf and c dcf was higher than 1 which points to the biological production of such substances within the biofilm an additional factor that visibly affected the gac filters performance was the dilution of the influent due to rainy weather conditions in fig 5 b the ratio q qmax illustrates the influent dilution dynamics dilution causes an inversion of the concentration gradient between influent low concentrations and the activated carbon high concentrations hence when a diluted influent comes into the gac filter desorption is likely to take place and the removal of the micropollutants may be affected increase in c c0 for instance at approximately bv 30 000 m³ m³ an unusual increment in the c c0 of pmd and cbz occurred which was attributed to the sustained dilution that the system experienced during this period q qmax of nearly 1 3 6 long term performance of the micropollutant removal prerequisites for a successful gac process are a suitable pre treatment stage removal of phosphorus and suspended solids and the correct selection of the activated carbon type additionally an adequate ebct 20 min and a developed biofilm contribute to the optimal utilization of the gac adsorption capacity the long term performance data from gac filter s2 which was operated under such conditions was selected as the example hydraffin ar ebct 24 2 1 8 min toperation 974d fig 6 a shows the breakthrough behaviour of two non biodegradable substances pmd and cbz that differ in their adsorbability for cbz the effluent concentration remained below the loq until approximately bv 17 000 m³ m³ whereas for pmd breakthrough started at approximately bv 5 500 m³ m³ after breakthrough the effluent concentrations increased constantly which verified their non biodegradability fig 6 b displays the breakthrough behaviour of two biodegradable and well adsorbable substances metoprolol met and amisulpride asp met breakthrough started at bv 20 000 m³ m³ from bv 25 000 m³ m³ onwards c c0 fluctuated between 0 1 0 2 due to biodegradation for asp effluent concentrations were below the loq until the end of the operation period approximately bv 45 000 m³ m³ this indicates the constant removal of asp due to both biological and or adsorptive processes the extent to which each process contributed to the removal could not be clearly differentiated lastly fig 6 c shows the breakthrough behaviour for opn and tmd as non biodegradable substances although these two substances are considered in the literature as non biodegradable the observed breakthrough behaviour of both substances suggests that biological processes might have taken part in their removal with our data however we cannot fully explain the specific influence that biodegradation had on the removal of opn and tmd fig 6 d shows the relationship between treated bv carbon usage rate cur and qdoc at the end of the operation period qdoc was higher than the expected equilibrium capacity qe 140 180 mgdoc mggac for doc0 4 1 6 6 mg l the q surplus can be explained by the biologically removed doc moreover it accounted for 25 42 of the total qdoc although the microbial colonisation of the gac surface is likely to cause pore blockages we were able to prove that biofilm growth on gac did not affect removal of micropollutants and on the contrary it fostered their removal to achieve a c c0 0 2 a single gac filter had a cur between 8 19 mg l cur is specific to each micropollutant and for our system it can be ranked as follows asp met tmd cbz the required cur was comparable and even lower than the cur of similar pac systems as reported by böhler et al 2012 and rizzo et al 2019 parallel operation of several filters can improve the utilisation of the carbon capacity section 3 5 for the same gac filter s2 breakthrough behaviour of 12 other micropollutants uv254nm and doc is included in the supplementary material 4 conclusions gac filters contribute to reaching high quality effluents in this study the long term performance of gac filters and their biological activity was monitored the occurrence of biological processes that improved the micropollutant removal was evident from our results the conclusions were both lab and pilot scale experiments showed that the bdoc in the effluent of the wwtp accounted for 20 of the total doc similarly adsorption analyses showed that the non absorbable doc fraction accounted for 20 of the total doc biodegradation changed the distribution of the adsorbable doc fractions reducing the competition between micropollutants and well adsorbable doc fractions k 100 mg g l mg 1 n the early start of the removal of moderately adsorbable and otherwise poorly biodegradable substances such as gpt suggested a fast colonisation of the gac surface by specialized bacteria backwashing was necessary to control the biofilm growth in the gac filters depending on the pre treatment the frequency of the backwashing events changed we observed backwashing frequencies of 0 1 1 week for filters operated with a membrane pre treatment and 1 2 1 week for filters operated with cf wastewater temperature and nutrient concentrations also influenced the backwashing frequency backwashing did not affect the effluent quality optimal operation conditions in combination with a developed biofilm led to a better utilization of the adsorption capacity the curs of gac filters were comparable to or even lower than those from pac applications in terms of qdoc biological removal extended the life span of the filters by approximately 25 42 declaration of

17352,the disposal of huge municipal sludge with high moisture content has led to numerous energy consumption and brought extensive concerns in the world in this paper three dewatering modes ultrahigh pressure mechanical dewatering mode umdw pressurized electro dewatering pedw with constant voltage mode u pedw and constant voltage gradient mode g pedw were performed on a self designed pressurized electro dewatering apparatus for municipal sludge the pore structures and moisture distributions were detected by low field nuclear magnetic resonance technology meanwhile the moisture distributions and quantitative bound strength were analyzed by the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry test moreover a pore scale electro osmosis model was accordingly developed based on the fractal characteristics of pore size distribution finally the effect of dewatering modes and operating parameters on moisture content and energy consumption were examined in detail the results indicate that the pore scale electro osmosis model show good consistency with experimental data the electric field can drive the middle layers water to overcome the capillary pressure and make g pedw removing more water than umdw the moisture content of dewatered municipal sludge by g pedw and u pedw reaches to 28 41 and 27 33 respectively furthermore the energy consumption of g pedw is 189 62wh kg h2o it is much lower than that of u pedw therefore the g pedw mode with low moisture content and less energy consumption indicates best dewatering performance compared with umdw and u pedw modes the present work is helpful to understand the dewatering mechanisms of g pedw and provides useful guidelines for g pedw dewatering technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords municipal sludge pressurized electro dewatering constant voltage gradient moisture content pore structure fractal 1 introduction along with the process of industrialization and modernization the annual increase in the production of sludge has led to a sharp increase in energy consumption and disposal costs therefore municipal sludge dewatering has attracted increasing interests maspolim et al 2015 wu et al 2016 in order to reduce the moisture content m c municipal sludge is generally conditioned by chemical physical or biological methods such as chemical additives wei et al 2019 liang et al 2020 ultrasound liu et al 2014 cai et al 2018 microwave rao et al 2019b heating wang et al 2019 freezing shahheidar et al 2018 before mechanical dewatering mdw the m c of dewatered sludge can be lowered to 60 80 with these traditional dewatering technologies however rao et al 2019a recently reported that there was a dewatering limitation for mdw technology and they ascribed this dewatering limitation to the bound water within the internal floc structure and capillary water in the micro pores therefore different technologies have been proposed to further reduce m c of sludge one of the most successful technical solutions is pressurized electro dewatering pedw technology yuan et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2016 and 2018 the particle suspensions of municipal sludge possess negative surface charges surrounded by a layer with a higher density of positive charges the electric double layer forms on the channel surface wakeman 2007 christensen et al 2015 guo et al 2018 wójcik and stachowicz 2019 thus water in sludge can be quickly and effectively removed by using electro osmosis principle in pedw technology tuan et al 2008 found that more water was removed by the electric field coupled with compressed pressure p c glendinning et al 2008 showed that pedw technology can effectively remove water in micro pores which is difficult to remove by mdw mahmoud et al 2011 indicated that pressurized electro dewatering with constant voltage mode u pedw could remove extra 10 24 water compared with mdw visigalli et al 2017 reported that the m c by u pedw further decreased with increased potential although high voltage with high electric current accelerates the water flow and lower m c of the sludge it simultaneously leads to increased sludge resistance and numerous energy consumption olivier et al 2014 2015 mahmoud et al 2016 yu et al 2017 stated that more low utilization joules heating would generate with high voltage in the pedw and it may induce considerable loss of energy citeau et al 2012 found that the pressurized electro dewatering with constant electric current mode i pedw created more joules heating and consumed more energy because of the increased resistance of the sludge cake in order to further reduce the energy consumption pham et al 2010 performed pressurized electro dewatering with constant voltage gradient mode g pedw and found that m c was reduced to 52 when vg reaches to 10v cm since the vg is defined as the voltage value per unit thickness of the cake the change of cake thickness t c during dewatering process has significant influence on vg and m c of sludge however the quantitative change of t c in most of the present studies was neglected and it is lack of real time vg detection methods and apparatus municipal sludge is a highly porous medium with complex pore network and colloid particles the microscopic structures and moisture distribution of sludge cake have great influence on pedw vaxelaire and cézac 2004 xu et al 2013 2016 2017 hassine et al 2017 liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 feng et al 2014 and krejcirikova et al 2019 used the scanning electron microscope to detect the pore structure of the sludge cake during dewatering and found that the applied electric field can effectively destroy the flocs in the sludge and change the pore structure accordingly cao et al 2018 found that the pore volume near the cathode plate increased as the applied voltage increased while pore volume near the anode plate was almost invariable because the flocs would gather toward the anode due to the electrophoresis effect mahmoud et al 2018 proposed a micro dewatering model for u pedw and i pedw to explain the phenomenon that the pore volume increases from anode to cathode by electric field as a non destructive rapid measurement method low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technology has been widely used to study the micro pore structures evdokimov et al 2003 jin et al 2013 tian et al 2014 lu et al 2019 rao et al 2019a investigated the pore structures of sludge in the umdw process by lf nmr mao et al 2018 adopted lf nmr to measure the moisture distribution of sludge in order to study water mobility under different pre treatment methods cai et al 2018 used the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry tg dsc to understand the mechanisms of acidification and ultrasound treatment before mdw however quantitative study of pore size distribution during dewatering process remains insufficient and water migration in micro pores as well as layer pore structure is not clear in this paper three dewatering modes including umdw and u pedw as well as g pedw modes will be performed on a new self designed pedw apparatus for municipal sludge the pore structure and moisture distribution of g pedw will be quantitatively characterized by using lf nmr and tg dsc technology and a pore scale fractal model will be accordingly developed to further understand the dewatering mechanisms of g pedw the effect of multiple parameters including dewatering time t d compressed pressure p c initial sludge mass m is voltage and voltage gradient vg on the m c of sludge cake and energy consumption will be carried out to provide useful guidelines on pedw 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples the municipal sludge was sampled from hangzhou qige wastewater treatment plant in china which has a capacity of wastewater treatment of 1 2 million tons per day with anaerobic anoxic oxic process these sludge samples were pre dewatered by a belt pressure filter through pretreatment with 2 3kg cationic polyacrylamide per ton of dry sludge and the m c of the pre dewatered sludge is approximate 80 the samples were stored at 4 c no more than 3 days to avoid property transformation 2 2 experimental apparatus the self designed pedw device consists of an ultrahigh pressure dewatering apparatus with applied electric field and vg control system as shown in fig 1 a the pedw device is composed of hydraulic system lifting jack steel chamber filter chamber moving piston upper cover plate cathode plate anode plate polycarbonate tube filter cloth reinforced cloth pressure controller and filtrate measuring cylinder the diameter of filter chamber is 100mm and the applied pressure ranges from 0 to 12mpa the anode and cathode plates are made of graphite and titanium alloy respectively the electric field is provided by a direct electric current dc stabilized voltage power supply lw 6020kd hong kong longwei instrument co ltd china with measuring range of 0 80v and accuracy of 0 1v the electric current value was measured by a digital electric current voltmeter vc890c shenzhen yishengshengli technology co ltd china the temperature of the sludge cake in the anode was measured by a k type thermocouple and its thermometer as shown in fig 1 b the vg control system includes controller stm32f103zet6 stepper motor pufeide 57byg250b displacement detection module xiyuwxy31 0505 s3 cable displacement sensor and voltage detection module icl7135 the working principle of the constant voltage gradient cvg control system is illustrated in fig 1 c firstly the t c of cake was measured by the displacement detection module and the applied voltage was detected by the detection module then the controller correspondingly controls the stepper motor to adjust the power supply voltage according to scheduled vg furthermore the difference between target and real time measured voltages was solved to ensure the accuracy of cvg the synchronous thermal analyzer sta449f3 netzsch scientific instruments trading co ltd german was used to determine the bound strength b s of sludge the lf nmr analyzer mesomr23 060h i suzhou niumag analytical instrument co ltd china was used to detect the pore structure of sludge cakes it is mainly composed of permanent magnet sample tube radio frequency system data acquisition and analysis system the main parameters of lf nmr analyzer are listed as follows magnetic field strength 0 5 0 05t instrument main frequency 21 3mhz probe coil diameter 60mm effective sample detection range ø60mχh60mm 2 3 experimental methods the influence of three dewatering modes including umdw and g pedw as well as u pedw on the m c and energy consumption was explored and the value of voltage gradient in g pedw was equal to the value of voltage in u pedw single factor method was used to study the effect of different operating parameters including compressed pressure p c dewatering time t d mass of initial sludge m is voltage and voltage gradient on the m c and energy consumption under three dewatering modes the operating parameters are shown in tables 1 and 2 it should be noted that the t d are 10 20 30 40 50 60min for every experimental group in table 1 in addition each series of experimental groups were repeated three times and single experiment was carried out for the non quantitative researches oven dry method is commonly used for m c measurement of sludge which is defined as 1 m c m 1 m 2 m 1 where m c is the moisture content of sludge cake m 1 is the mass of dewatered sludge cake g and m 2 is the mass of dry sludge cake after drying at 105 c for 24h g the sludge compression ratio c r is defined as rao et al 2017 2 c r l 1 l e l 1 where l 1 and l e are the thickness of initial sludge and final sludge cake respectively mm the thickness of sludge cake was measured by a vernier caliper with an accuracy of 0 02mm due to few energy consumption of compressed pressure the electric energy consumption accounts for most of the whole energy consumption the electrical energy consumption can be calculated by the following equation yuan and weng 2003 visigalli et al 2017 mahmoud et al 2016 3 e c v i t dt m where e c is the energy consumption required to remove unit mass of water wh kg h2o m is the mass of removed water kg v is the real time applied voltage values v and i t is the real time electric current values of the sludge cake a the filtrate was collected in a graduated cylinder from both the cathode and anode side and data was recorded every unit time during the dewatering process the dewatering process continues until no more than two drops of filtrate flow out within 15min 1hour if necessary then the transient filtration data was obtained feng et al 2014 the filtrate flow rate is defined as 4 f r m s t d where f r is the filtrate flow rate g min m s is the mass of filtrate g during the unit time and t d is the unit time min the filtrate rate can be used to evaluate the influence of electric field on the dewatering performance and efficiency the type of moisture distribution was divided as free water fw interstitial water iw and the sum of bound water and surface water bw sw in this paper these types of moisture distribution can be classified by different b s shown in table 3 keey 1972 the b s of moisture in the dewatered sludge kj kg is calculated by the following equation 5 b s q c m s where q c is the heat flow at 90 c kj s m s is the drying rate g min the sludge sample weight for a tg dsc test was maintained at approximately 10mg to detect the b s cell temperature was heated from 25 to 90 c with heating rate of 10 c min and kept stable at 90 c for 45min deng et al 2011 the pore size distribution and mass of different layers water were measured by testing the relaxation time t 2 in sludge pores with lf nmr technology the t 2 value is closely related to its pore construction rao et al 2019a and the relationship between t 2 and radius of pores is defined by 6 1 t 2 λ 2 r where λ is the transverse relaxation rate which is related to the chemical property of sludge and r is the radius of pore µm based on eq 6 it can be found that greater value of t 2 represents a larger pore size therefore the pore size and t 2 distribution of dewatered sludge cakes under different dewatering conditions were measured by carr purcell meiboom gill method the mass of water in different cake layers was obtained according to t 2 value of different layers by one dimensional gradient hard pulse spin echo method the small round piece originated from the dewatered sludge cake was put into a test tube it was divided non destructively into 11 layers with unit layer thickness of 0 16mm lf nmr signal distribution in different cake layer was obtained and produced and mass of water in different layers was obtained accordingly 3 pore scale fractal model in order to understand the dewatering mechanism the pore structures were measured by lf nmr and a pore scale fractal model for electro dewatering was developed accordingly it can be seen in fig 2 a that the percentage of r 0 01 pores the radius is less than 0 01µm of g pedw is larger than that of umdw while the percentage of pore radius ranging from 0 01µm to 0 1µm of g pedw is smaller than that of umdw it has been shown that the pore size distribution of sludge cake indicates statistically fractal scaling characteristics qiu et al 2020 therefore as shown in fig 2 b the porous sludge sample is assumed to be composed of a bundle of tortuous capillaries xu et al 2016 2019 shen et al 2020 7 f r d f r m i n d f r d f 1 where f r is the fractal probability density function of pore capillary radius r d f is the fractal dimension for pore size distribution according to fractal theory yu 2008 the total number of pores capillaries in a representative volume element rve is n r max r min d f and the relationship between porosity ϕ and pore fractal dimension is expressed by 8 ϕ r min r max d e d f where d e is the euclidean dimension the subscripts min and max denote the minimum and maximum pore radii the pore fractal dimension is calculated by d f d e ln ϕ ln r min r max the electro osmosis flow rate through a tortuous capillary can be expressed by rice whitehead equation rice and whitehead et al 1965 paillat et al 2000 liang et al 2015 9 q π r 4 8 μ δ p t l where μ is fluid viscosity l is the length of capillary δp t is the pressure difference caused by electro osmosis flow at equilibrium the pressure difference with time is written as 10 δ p t 8 ε ζ v r 2 1 2 i 1 κ r κ r i 0 κ r 1 exp t η where ε is the dielectric constant ζ is the zeta potential of solid surface v is applied voltage κ 1 δ is the reciprocal of double layer thickness i 0 and i 1 are the zero order and first order modified bessel functions respectively the response time η is determined by η 4 μ r 2 l n ρ g r 4 where n is the parallel channels number ρ is the liquid density g is the acceleration r is the radius the capillary radius r is much larger than the double layer thickness δ which is around 2nm for a conductive liquid such as water thus the value of 1 2 i 1 κ r κ r i 0 κ r is approximated as 1 as κ r 1 therefore the electro osmosis flow rate through a tortuous capillary can be simplified as 11 q r π ε ζ μ v l r 2 1 exp t η the electro osmosis flow rate through a unit cell a u in a porous medium is obtained by integrating eq 11 from the minimum to maximum radii 12 q r min r max q r f r ndr π ε ζ μ v l d f 2 d f r max 2 1 ϕ 1 exp t η accordingly the total electro osmosis flow rate through the sludge sample with cross sectional area a c can be written as 13 q t a c a u q a c ε ζ μ v l ϕ 1 exp t η where the cross sectional area of rev is expressed as a u a p ϕ π d f 2 d f 1 ϕ ϕ r max 2 and the dewatered water weight in time t can be calculated by 14 q st 0 t q t dt a c ε ζ μ v l ϕ t η exp t η η in order to evaluate the dewatered water in electro dewatering the experimental set up and parameters are concluded in table 4 with the determined maximum and minimum pore radii the pore fractal dimension and averaged pore radius can be gotten by d f d e ln ϕ ln r min r max 1 95 and r ave d f d f 1 r min 0 21 μ m respectively thus parallel channels number and response time can be calculated as n 3 384 1 0 9 and η 1304 7 respectively in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed electro osmosis model the electro osmosis experiments were carried out without p c it can be clearly seen that the predicted dewatered water by electro dewatering eq 14 agrees well with measured data as the change of m c is not obvious it should be noted that the decrease of m c in the electro dewatering process was not taken into account in the present fractal model thus the predicted dewatered water will increase sustainably with time but the measured dewatered water will decrease after a few minutes of dewatering therefore the model is available for the prediction of dewatered water in the early stage of electro dewatering 4 results and discussion 4 1 filtrate flow rate to further characterize the dewatering performance of solid liquid separation process the samples were dewatered by umdw p c 8mpa m is 100g t d 120min and g pedw p c 8mpa m is 100g t d 120min vg 36v cm then the transient filtration flow rate f r during the umdw f r umdw and g pedw f r g pedw dewatering process is shown in fig 3 a it can be clearly seen that f r varies with different dewatering time the fastest f r umdw and f r g pedw appear within the first 2min and they drop greatly to 4 5g min in the following 2min and subsequently reduce slowly during 4min to 15min finally they gradually tend to be 0 after 15min furthermore f r g pedw is much higher than f r umdw within the first 2min the maximum difference of f r between g pedw and umdw is 6 82g min it indicates that the electric kinetics improves the dewatering efficiency of g pedw with applied electric field with the continuous run of dewatering f r umdw exceeds f r g pedw after 6min and the maximum difference is only 0 67g min at 6min during this period the mechanical pressure extremely decreases the porosity and pore radius and the electro osmosis flow rate accordingly drops because of pore structure changing based on eq 13 when t d exceeds 90min the g pedw process is still proceeding f r g pedw 0 017g min while f r umdw is 0 as shown in fig 3 b the m c will decrease from 83 15 to 45 38 and 50 13 for g pedw and umdw respectively the 4 75 difference of m c between g pedw and umdw is attributed to the effect of electro osmosis 4 2 moisture distribution and pores structure as shown in fig 4 a the calibration curve reflects that the t 2 value is highly related to the mass of water thus the t 2 distribution curve can be used to calculate the m c of sludge under g pedw and umdw as shown in fig 4 b the percentage of different t 2 value builds the t 2 distribution curve the t 2 distribution curve of umdw and g pedw is both composed of two peaks one is a large peak around 1ms and the other one is a small peak between 10ms and 100ms the area of t 2 peak is related to the m c of sludge and the larger area of peak is the higher m c is therefore as shown in table 5 the m c of umdw and g pedw is 37 14 and 28 85 respectively furthermore the t 2 can deduce to the features of b s of water molecular in the sludge and lower t 2 means more b s of water molecular mao et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 b bw sw of g pedw and umdw modes is represented by the large peak and iw is the small one these results are consistent with quantitative b s results of tg dsc test as shown in fig 4 c under g pedw and umdw bw sw has a high b s over 166 67kj kg thus the percentage of bw sw and iw is obtained and shown in fig 4 d and the results of tg dsc and lf nmr are similar firstly the moisture of sludge cake consists of huge bw sw and little iw under g pedw and umdw because most of iw and fw can be removed by the effect of mechanical pressure and the bw sw of g pedw is lower than that of umdw the difference of bw sw between g pedw and umdw is 6 61 and 8 21 by tg dsc and lf nmr respectively in order to study the influence of pore structure on the water removing process the moisture mass in different layers of cake is illustrated in fig 5 a the first layer no 1 is the anode side and the no 11 layer is the cathode side it is found that the most of water of sludge cake under umdw distribute between 3rd to 8th layers ranges from 0 51mm to 1 32mm rao et al 2019a found that the outer layer of cake by umdw is more compact than the inner layer in which the water is hindered so that most of water is trapped in the inner layers and cannot be removed by umdw however as for the cake after g pedw the highest moisture weight locates within the 5th to 9th layers although plenty of water is still located in the inner layer like the distribution of umdw the water migrates to the cathode side under g pedw and the mass of water under g pedw around cathode ranges from 1 49mm to 1 82mm is higher than that of anode range from 0 17mm to 0 51mm then the motion of water leads to a higher m c of g pedw in the cathode side than that of umdw these results mean that the electro osmosis drives the water with positive charge to the negative electrode mahmoud et al 2018 a physical model is proposed and shown in fig 5 b in order to illustrate water migration process the dewatering process is essentially a solid liquid separation process where the moisture is discharged through the solid channels the particles are compacted during dewatering process and large pores may change into micro pores then the water migration of sludge cake under g pedw and umdw is illustrated as shown in fig 5 b1 1 and b2 1 many micro pores hinder the water to discharge because of the capillary pressure between adjoining particles xu et al 2016 2017 rao et al 2019a however due to the electric kinetics phenomenon the negative charged particles move towards the anode yang et al 2009 and the water with associated cations is driven towards the cathode mahmoud et al 2018 the motion of solid and liquid works together to make the water overcome the capillary pressure and pass the micro pore as shown in fig 5 b1 2 and b2 2 therefore f r g pedw shown in fig 3 a will firstly decrease as the pore structure changes fig 5 a and b s increases fig 4 c but g pedw removes more water than umdw because some water may overcome the capillary pressure in g pedw mode fig 5 b thus m c of sludge by g pedw is lower than that of umdw 4 3 constant voltage gradient it is clearly seen from figs 6 a and b that municipal sludge is a kind of high compressibility sludge the maximum c r of g pedw and u pedw reaches up to 83 36 and 89 18 respectively as shown in figs 6 c and d the t c of both g pedw and u pedw modes significantly decreases with the enhanced mechanical applied pressure but increases with the more initial sludge these changes of t c bring about a great influence on the applied voltage under g pedw thus as shown in fig 6 e the real time voltage of g pedw mode drops sharply in the early dewatering process then gradually tends to be stable finally the minimum applied voltage is only 6 59v it should be noted that the variable voltage in g pedw is far below the constant voltage in u pedw after 10min 4 4 parameters analysis figs 7 a and b indicate the relationship between m c and p c as well as t d with g pedw and u pedw modes the different parameters of g pedw and of u pedw were used the results show that u pedw and g pedw can significantly reduce the m c of sludge the minimum m c under u pedw p c 8mpa m is 100g voltage 36v cm t d 60min and g pedw p c 8mpa m is 100g voltage 36v cm t d 60min can reach 31 17 and 29 07 respectively figs 7 c and d show the relationship between m is and m c of the sludge cake the m c of dewatered sludge cake is both higher than 45 under g pedw and u pedw when m is increases to 200g in addition as shown in fig 7 e by using different voltage and vg values the m c can be lowered to 27 41 and 28 33 under u pedw and g pedw respectively although the dewatering rate of u pedw is faster than that of g pedw in the early stage of dewatering process it slows down with time and the changing trends of m c with the dewatering run are similar in u pedw and g pedw with different voltage and vg values fig 7 f illustrates m c of dewatered sludge cake of three dewatering modes it can be seen that m c from high to low is umdw g pedw and u pedw and the maximum difference of m c between u pedw and umdw is 8 1 at 20min however the maximum difference between g pedw and u pedw is only 4 02 at 60min after 40min of dewatering process m c of umdw almost no longer drops and remains stable while m c of g pedw and u pedw continues to decrease because of the electric field furthermore it can be seen that m c of g pedw and u pedw at 20min is equivalent to that of umdw at 60min it means that the applied electric field can significantly save dewatering time and improve the dewatering efficiency 4 5 energy consumption analysis in order to study the energy consumption of pedw the value of voltage was set to be equal to vg based on eq 3 the energy consumption per unit of removed water can be calculated by the real time electric current voltage and mass of removed water as shown in fig 8 a the energy consumption of u pedw and g pedw increases with enhanced voltage and vg respectively the minimum difference of energy consumption between them is only 33 24wh kg h2o while the maximum difference reaches up to 189 62wh kg h2o on the other hand it can be seen in fig 8 b that minimum m c of u pedw and g pedw is 27 33 and 28 85 respectively the difference of m c between u pedw and g pedw is only 1 52 therefore g pedw mode indicates better dewatering performance with low m c and less energy consumption the electric current for gs pedw and u pedw both increases in the first 20min as shown in fig 8 c this can be attributed to the electrode reaction and the diffusion of charged species through the sludge cake from one electrode to another during this period mahmoud et al 2010 2016 citeau et al 2012 then the dropping f r induces the electric current to decrease after 20min oliver et al 2015 in addition it can be seen that the electric current of u pedw is much higher than that of g pedw and the maximum difference of electric current between them is 250ma fig 8 c indicates that the resistance of sludge cake under u pedw and g pedw both decreases with dewatering time in the first 20min because of the decrement of cake thickness mahmoud et al 2011 and then the resistance increases with time which can be ascribed to the reduction of m c conrardy et al 2016 furthermore as shown in fig 8 d the temperature of g pedw and u pedw will increase during the dewatering process it is important that u pedw can cause numerous joules heating when m c reaches a lower level mahmoud et al 2016 yu et al 2017 because the energy consumption of u pedw is similar to that of thermal drying when m c is less than 55 olivier et al 2015 however the maximum temperature of u pedw reaches to 45 7 c while that of g pedw is only 24 3 c and the temperature of g pedw and u gped in the dewatering process is all below 50 c which cannot meet the needs of solid pyrolysis and moisture evaporation zaker et al 2019 thus the effect of temperature on pore structures was not included here 5 conclusion three dewatering modes ultrahigh pressure mechanical dewatering mode umdw pressurized electro dewatering with constant voltage mode u pedw and constant voltage gradient mode g pedw were performed on a self designed pressurized electro dewatering apparatus for municipal sludge the pore structures and moisture distributions were detected by low field nuclear magnetic resonance technology meanwhile the moisture distributions and quantitative bound strength were analyzed by the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry test a pore scale electro osmosis model is developed based on the fractal characteristics of the pore size distribution which is available for the prediction of dewatered water in the early stage of electro dewatering experimental results show that the moisture content of dewatered municipal sludge by g pedw and u pedw reaches 28 41 and 27 33 respectively but the energy consumption of g pedw is much lower than that of u pedw the maximum difference of energy consumption reaches up to 189 62wh kg h2o based on the analysis of filtrate flow rate moisture distributions b s as well as pore structure g pedw can remove more water and has higher dewatering efficiency compared with umdw g pedw indicates better dewatering performance with low m

17352,the disposal of huge municipal sludge with high moisture content has led to numerous energy consumption and brought extensive concerns in the world in this paper three dewatering modes ultrahigh pressure mechanical dewatering mode umdw pressurized electro dewatering pedw with constant voltage mode u pedw and constant voltage gradient mode g pedw were performed on a self designed pressurized electro dewatering apparatus for municipal sludge the pore structures and moisture distributions were detected by low field nuclear magnetic resonance technology meanwhile the moisture distributions and quantitative bound strength were analyzed by the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry test moreover a pore scale electro osmosis model was accordingly developed based on the fractal characteristics of pore size distribution finally the effect of dewatering modes and operating parameters on moisture content and energy consumption were examined in detail the results indicate that the pore scale electro osmosis model show good consistency with experimental data the electric field can drive the middle layers water to overcome the capillary pressure and make g pedw removing more water than umdw the moisture content of dewatered municipal sludge by g pedw and u pedw reaches to 28 41 and 27 33 respectively furthermore the energy consumption of g pedw is 189 62wh kg h2o it is much lower than that of u pedw therefore the g pedw mode with low moisture content and less energy consumption indicates best dewatering performance compared with umdw and u pedw modes the present work is helpful to understand the dewatering mechanisms of g pedw and provides useful guidelines for g pedw dewatering technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords municipal sludge pressurized electro dewatering constant voltage gradient moisture content pore structure fractal 1 introduction along with the process of industrialization and modernization the annual increase in the production of sludge has led to a sharp increase in energy consumption and disposal costs therefore municipal sludge dewatering has attracted increasing interests maspolim et al 2015 wu et al 2016 in order to reduce the moisture content m c municipal sludge is generally conditioned by chemical physical or biological methods such as chemical additives wei et al 2019 liang et al 2020 ultrasound liu et al 2014 cai et al 2018 microwave rao et al 2019b heating wang et al 2019 freezing shahheidar et al 2018 before mechanical dewatering mdw the m c of dewatered sludge can be lowered to 60 80 with these traditional dewatering technologies however rao et al 2019a recently reported that there was a dewatering limitation for mdw technology and they ascribed this dewatering limitation to the bound water within the internal floc structure and capillary water in the micro pores therefore different technologies have been proposed to further reduce m c of sludge one of the most successful technical solutions is pressurized electro dewatering pedw technology yuan et al 2011 mahmoud et al 2016 and 2018 the particle suspensions of municipal sludge possess negative surface charges surrounded by a layer with a higher density of positive charges the electric double layer forms on the channel surface wakeman 2007 christensen et al 2015 guo et al 2018 wójcik and stachowicz 2019 thus water in sludge can be quickly and effectively removed by using electro osmosis principle in pedw technology tuan et al 2008 found that more water was removed by the electric field coupled with compressed pressure p c glendinning et al 2008 showed that pedw technology can effectively remove water in micro pores which is difficult to remove by mdw mahmoud et al 2011 indicated that pressurized electro dewatering with constant voltage mode u pedw could remove extra 10 24 water compared with mdw visigalli et al 2017 reported that the m c by u pedw further decreased with increased potential although high voltage with high electric current accelerates the water flow and lower m c of the sludge it simultaneously leads to increased sludge resistance and numerous energy consumption olivier et al 2014 2015 mahmoud et al 2016 yu et al 2017 stated that more low utilization joules heating would generate with high voltage in the pedw and it may induce considerable loss of energy citeau et al 2012 found that the pressurized electro dewatering with constant electric current mode i pedw created more joules heating and consumed more energy because of the increased resistance of the sludge cake in order to further reduce the energy consumption pham et al 2010 performed pressurized electro dewatering with constant voltage gradient mode g pedw and found that m c was reduced to 52 when vg reaches to 10v cm since the vg is defined as the voltage value per unit thickness of the cake the change of cake thickness t c during dewatering process has significant influence on vg and m c of sludge however the quantitative change of t c in most of the present studies was neglected and it is lack of real time vg detection methods and apparatus municipal sludge is a highly porous medium with complex pore network and colloid particles the microscopic structures and moisture distribution of sludge cake have great influence on pedw vaxelaire and cézac 2004 xu et al 2013 2016 2017 hassine et al 2017 liang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 feng et al 2014 and krejcirikova et al 2019 used the scanning electron microscope to detect the pore structure of the sludge cake during dewatering and found that the applied electric field can effectively destroy the flocs in the sludge and change the pore structure accordingly cao et al 2018 found that the pore volume near the cathode plate increased as the applied voltage increased while pore volume near the anode plate was almost invariable because the flocs would gather toward the anode due to the electrophoresis effect mahmoud et al 2018 proposed a micro dewatering model for u pedw and i pedw to explain the phenomenon that the pore volume increases from anode to cathode by electric field as a non destructive rapid measurement method low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technology has been widely used to study the micro pore structures evdokimov et al 2003 jin et al 2013 tian et al 2014 lu et al 2019 rao et al 2019a investigated the pore structures of sludge in the umdw process by lf nmr mao et al 2018 adopted lf nmr to measure the moisture distribution of sludge in order to study water mobility under different pre treatment methods cai et al 2018 used the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry tg dsc to understand the mechanisms of acidification and ultrasound treatment before mdw however quantitative study of pore size distribution during dewatering process remains insufficient and water migration in micro pores as well as layer pore structure is not clear in this paper three dewatering modes including umdw and u pedw as well as g pedw modes will be performed on a new self designed pedw apparatus for municipal sludge the pore structure and moisture distribution of g pedw will be quantitatively characterized by using lf nmr and tg dsc technology and a pore scale fractal model will be accordingly developed to further understand the dewatering mechanisms of g pedw the effect of multiple parameters including dewatering time t d compressed pressure p c initial sludge mass m is voltage and voltage gradient vg on the m c of sludge cake and energy consumption will be carried out to provide useful guidelines on pedw 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples the municipal sludge was sampled from hangzhou qige wastewater treatment plant in china which has a capacity of wastewater treatment of 1 2 million tons per day with anaerobic anoxic oxic process these sludge samples were pre dewatered by a belt pressure filter through pretreatment with 2 3kg cationic polyacrylamide per ton of dry sludge and the m c of the pre dewatered sludge is approximate 80 the samples were stored at 4 c no more than 3 days to avoid property transformation 2 2 experimental apparatus the self designed pedw device consists of an ultrahigh pressure dewatering apparatus with applied electric field and vg control system as shown in fig 1 a the pedw device is composed of hydraulic system lifting jack steel chamber filter chamber moving piston upper cover plate cathode plate anode plate polycarbonate tube filter cloth reinforced cloth pressure controller and filtrate measuring cylinder the diameter of filter chamber is 100mm and the applied pressure ranges from 0 to 12mpa the anode and cathode plates are made of graphite and titanium alloy respectively the electric field is provided by a direct electric current dc stabilized voltage power supply lw 6020kd hong kong longwei instrument co ltd china with measuring range of 0 80v and accuracy of 0 1v the electric current value was measured by a digital electric current voltmeter vc890c shenzhen yishengshengli technology co ltd china the temperature of the sludge cake in the anode was measured by a k type thermocouple and its thermometer as shown in fig 1 b the vg control system includes controller stm32f103zet6 stepper motor pufeide 57byg250b displacement detection module xiyuwxy31 0505 s3 cable displacement sensor and voltage detection module icl7135 the working principle of the constant voltage gradient cvg control system is illustrated in fig 1 c firstly the t c of cake was measured by the displacement detection module and the applied voltage was detected by the detection module then the controller correspondingly controls the stepper motor to adjust the power supply voltage according to scheduled vg furthermore the difference between target and real time measured voltages was solved to ensure the accuracy of cvg the synchronous thermal analyzer sta449f3 netzsch scientific instruments trading co ltd german was used to determine the bound strength b s of sludge the lf nmr analyzer mesomr23 060h i suzhou niumag analytical instrument co ltd china was used to detect the pore structure of sludge cakes it is mainly composed of permanent magnet sample tube radio frequency system data acquisition and analysis system the main parameters of lf nmr analyzer are listed as follows magnetic field strength 0 5 0 05t instrument main frequency 21 3mhz probe coil diameter 60mm effective sample detection range ø60mχh60mm 2 3 experimental methods the influence of three dewatering modes including umdw and g pedw as well as u pedw on the m c and energy consumption was explored and the value of voltage gradient in g pedw was equal to the value of voltage in u pedw single factor method was used to study the effect of different operating parameters including compressed pressure p c dewatering time t d mass of initial sludge m is voltage and voltage gradient on the m c and energy consumption under three dewatering modes the operating parameters are shown in tables 1 and 2 it should be noted that the t d are 10 20 30 40 50 60min for every experimental group in table 1 in addition each series of experimental groups were repeated three times and single experiment was carried out for the non quantitative researches oven dry method is commonly used for m c measurement of sludge which is defined as 1 m c m 1 m 2 m 1 where m c is the moisture content of sludge cake m 1 is the mass of dewatered sludge cake g and m 2 is the mass of dry sludge cake after drying at 105 c for 24h g the sludge compression ratio c r is defined as rao et al 2017 2 c r l 1 l e l 1 where l 1 and l e are the thickness of initial sludge and final sludge cake respectively mm the thickness of sludge cake was measured by a vernier caliper with an accuracy of 0 02mm due to few energy consumption of compressed pressure the electric energy consumption accounts for most of the whole energy consumption the electrical energy consumption can be calculated by the following equation yuan and weng 2003 visigalli et al 2017 mahmoud et al 2016 3 e c v i t dt m where e c is the energy consumption required to remove unit mass of water wh kg h2o m is the mass of removed water kg v is the real time applied voltage values v and i t is the real time electric current values of the sludge cake a the filtrate was collected in a graduated cylinder from both the cathode and anode side and data was recorded every unit time during the dewatering process the dewatering process continues until no more than two drops of filtrate flow out within 15min 1hour if necessary then the transient filtration data was obtained feng et al 2014 the filtrate flow rate is defined as 4 f r m s t d where f r is the filtrate flow rate g min m s is the mass of filtrate g during the unit time and t d is the unit time min the filtrate rate can be used to evaluate the influence of electric field on the dewatering performance and efficiency the type of moisture distribution was divided as free water fw interstitial water iw and the sum of bound water and surface water bw sw in this paper these types of moisture distribution can be classified by different b s shown in table 3 keey 1972 the b s of moisture in the dewatered sludge kj kg is calculated by the following equation 5 b s q c m s where q c is the heat flow at 90 c kj s m s is the drying rate g min the sludge sample weight for a tg dsc test was maintained at approximately 10mg to detect the b s cell temperature was heated from 25 to 90 c with heating rate of 10 c min and kept stable at 90 c for 45min deng et al 2011 the pore size distribution and mass of different layers water were measured by testing the relaxation time t 2 in sludge pores with lf nmr technology the t 2 value is closely related to its pore construction rao et al 2019a and the relationship between t 2 and radius of pores is defined by 6 1 t 2 λ 2 r where λ is the transverse relaxation rate which is related to the chemical property of sludge and r is the radius of pore µm based on eq 6 it can be found that greater value of t 2 represents a larger pore size therefore the pore size and t 2 distribution of dewatered sludge cakes under different dewatering conditions were measured by carr purcell meiboom gill method the mass of water in different cake layers was obtained according to t 2 value of different layers by one dimensional gradient hard pulse spin echo method the small round piece originated from the dewatered sludge cake was put into a test tube it was divided non destructively into 11 layers with unit layer thickness of 0 16mm lf nmr signal distribution in different cake layer was obtained and produced and mass of water in different layers was obtained accordingly 3 pore scale fractal model in order to understand the dewatering mechanism the pore structures were measured by lf nmr and a pore scale fractal model for electro dewatering was developed accordingly it can be seen in fig 2 a that the percentage of r 0 01 pores the radius is less than 0 01µm of g pedw is larger than that of umdw while the percentage of pore radius ranging from 0 01µm to 0 1µm of g pedw is smaller than that of umdw it has been shown that the pore size distribution of sludge cake indicates statistically fractal scaling characteristics qiu et al 2020 therefore as shown in fig 2 b the porous sludge sample is assumed to be composed of a bundle of tortuous capillaries xu et al 2016 2019 shen et al 2020 7 f r d f r m i n d f r d f 1 where f r is the fractal probability density function of pore capillary radius r d f is the fractal dimension for pore size distribution according to fractal theory yu 2008 the total number of pores capillaries in a representative volume element rve is n r max r min d f and the relationship between porosity ϕ and pore fractal dimension is expressed by 8 ϕ r min r max d e d f where d e is the euclidean dimension the subscripts min and max denote the minimum and maximum pore radii the pore fractal dimension is calculated by d f d e ln ϕ ln r min r max the electro osmosis flow rate through a tortuous capillary can be expressed by rice whitehead equation rice and whitehead et al 1965 paillat et al 2000 liang et al 2015 9 q π r 4 8 μ δ p t l where μ is fluid viscosity l is the length of capillary δp t is the pressure difference caused by electro osmosis flow at equilibrium the pressure difference with time is written as 10 δ p t 8 ε ζ v r 2 1 2 i 1 κ r κ r i 0 κ r 1 exp t η where ε is the dielectric constant ζ is the zeta potential of solid surface v is applied voltage κ 1 δ is the reciprocal of double layer thickness i 0 and i 1 are the zero order and first order modified bessel functions respectively the response time η is determined by η 4 μ r 2 l n ρ g r 4 where n is the parallel channels number ρ is the liquid density g is the acceleration r is the radius the capillary radius r is much larger than the double layer thickness δ which is around 2nm for a conductive liquid such as water thus the value of 1 2 i 1 κ r κ r i 0 κ r is approximated as 1 as κ r 1 therefore the electro osmosis flow rate through a tortuous capillary can be simplified as 11 q r π ε ζ μ v l r 2 1 exp t η the electro osmosis flow rate through a unit cell a u in a porous medium is obtained by integrating eq 11 from the minimum to maximum radii 12 q r min r max q r f r ndr π ε ζ μ v l d f 2 d f r max 2 1 ϕ 1 exp t η accordingly the total electro osmosis flow rate through the sludge sample with cross sectional area a c can be written as 13 q t a c a u q a c ε ζ μ v l ϕ 1 exp t η where the cross sectional area of rev is expressed as a u a p ϕ π d f 2 d f 1 ϕ ϕ r max 2 and the dewatered water weight in time t can be calculated by 14 q st 0 t q t dt a c ε ζ μ v l ϕ t η exp t η η in order to evaluate the dewatered water in electro dewatering the experimental set up and parameters are concluded in table 4 with the determined maximum and minimum pore radii the pore fractal dimension and averaged pore radius can be gotten by d f d e ln ϕ ln r min r max 1 95 and r ave d f d f 1 r min 0 21 μ m respectively thus parallel channels number and response time can be calculated as n 3 384 1 0 9 and η 1304 7 respectively in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed electro osmosis model the electro osmosis experiments were carried out without p c it can be clearly seen that the predicted dewatered water by electro dewatering eq 14 agrees well with measured data as the change of m c is not obvious it should be noted that the decrease of m c in the electro dewatering process was not taken into account in the present fractal model thus the predicted dewatered water will increase sustainably with time but the measured dewatered water will decrease after a few minutes of dewatering therefore the model is available for the prediction of dewatered water in the early stage of electro dewatering 4 results and discussion 4 1 filtrate flow rate to further characterize the dewatering performance of solid liquid separation process the samples were dewatered by umdw p c 8mpa m is 100g t d 120min and g pedw p c 8mpa m is 100g t d 120min vg 36v cm then the transient filtration flow rate f r during the umdw f r umdw and g pedw f r g pedw dewatering process is shown in fig 3 a it can be clearly seen that f r varies with different dewatering time the fastest f r umdw and f r g pedw appear within the first 2min and they drop greatly to 4 5g min in the following 2min and subsequently reduce slowly during 4min to 15min finally they gradually tend to be 0 after 15min furthermore f r g pedw is much higher than f r umdw within the first 2min the maximum difference of f r between g pedw and umdw is 6 82g min it indicates that the electric kinetics improves the dewatering efficiency of g pedw with applied electric field with the continuous run of dewatering f r umdw exceeds f r g pedw after 6min and the maximum difference is only 0 67g min at 6min during this period the mechanical pressure extremely decreases the porosity and pore radius and the electro osmosis flow rate accordingly drops because of pore structure changing based on eq 13 when t d exceeds 90min the g pedw process is still proceeding f r g pedw 0 017g min while f r umdw is 0 as shown in fig 3 b the m c will decrease from 83 15 to 45 38 and 50 13 for g pedw and umdw respectively the 4 75 difference of m c between g pedw and umdw is attributed to the effect of electro osmosis 4 2 moisture distribution and pores structure as shown in fig 4 a the calibration curve reflects that the t 2 value is highly related to the mass of water thus the t 2 distribution curve can be used to calculate the m c of sludge under g pedw and umdw as shown in fig 4 b the percentage of different t 2 value builds the t 2 distribution curve the t 2 distribution curve of umdw and g pedw is both composed of two peaks one is a large peak around 1ms and the other one is a small peak between 10ms and 100ms the area of t 2 peak is related to the m c of sludge and the larger area of peak is the higher m c is therefore as shown in table 5 the m c of umdw and g pedw is 37 14 and 28 85 respectively furthermore the t 2 can deduce to the features of b s of water molecular in the sludge and lower t 2 means more b s of water molecular mao et al 2018 as shown in fig 4 b bw sw of g pedw and umdw modes is represented by the large peak and iw is the small one these results are consistent with quantitative b s results of tg dsc test as shown in fig 4 c under g pedw and umdw bw sw has a high b s over 166 67kj kg thus the percentage of bw sw and iw is obtained and shown in fig 4 d and the results of tg dsc and lf nmr are similar firstly the moisture of sludge cake consists of huge bw sw and little iw under g pedw and umdw because most of iw and fw can be removed by the effect of mechanical pressure and the bw sw of g pedw is lower than that of umdw the difference of bw sw between g pedw and umdw is 6 61 and 8 21 by tg dsc and lf nmr respectively in order to study the influence of pore structure on the water removing process the moisture mass in different layers of cake is illustrated in fig 5 a the first layer no 1 is the anode side and the no 11 layer is the cathode side it is found that the most of water of sludge cake under umdw distribute between 3rd to 8th layers ranges from 0 51mm to 1 32mm rao et al 2019a found that the outer layer of cake by umdw is more compact than the inner layer in which the water is hindered so that most of water is trapped in the inner layers and cannot be removed by umdw however as for the cake after g pedw the highest moisture weight locates within the 5th to 9th layers although plenty of water is still located in the inner layer like the distribution of umdw the water migrates to the cathode side under g pedw and the mass of water under g pedw around cathode ranges from 1 49mm to 1 82mm is higher than that of anode range from 0 17mm to 0 51mm then the motion of water leads to a higher m c of g pedw in the cathode side than that of umdw these results mean that the electro osmosis drives the water with positive charge to the negative electrode mahmoud et al 2018 a physical model is proposed and shown in fig 5 b in order to illustrate water migration process the dewatering process is essentially a solid liquid separation process where the moisture is discharged through the solid channels the particles are compacted during dewatering process and large pores may change into micro pores then the water migration of sludge cake under g pedw and umdw is illustrated as shown in fig 5 b1 1 and b2 1 many micro pores hinder the water to discharge because of the capillary pressure between adjoining particles xu et al 2016 2017 rao et al 2019a however due to the electric kinetics phenomenon the negative charged particles move towards the anode yang et al 2009 and the water with associated cations is driven towards the cathode mahmoud et al 2018 the motion of solid and liquid works together to make the water overcome the capillary pressure and pass the micro pore as shown in fig 5 b1 2 and b2 2 therefore f r g pedw shown in fig 3 a will firstly decrease as the pore structure changes fig 5 a and b s increases fig 4 c but g pedw removes more water than umdw because some water may overcome the capillary pressure in g pedw mode fig 5 b thus m c of sludge by g pedw is lower than that of umdw 4 3 constant voltage gradient it is clearly seen from figs 6 a and b that municipal sludge is a kind of high compressibility sludge the maximum c r of g pedw and u pedw reaches up to 83 36 and 89 18 respectively as shown in figs 6 c and d the t c of both g pedw and u pedw modes significantly decreases with the enhanced mechanical applied pressure but increases with the more initial sludge these changes of t c bring about a great influence on the applied voltage under g pedw thus as shown in fig 6 e the real time voltage of g pedw mode drops sharply in the early dewatering process then gradually tends to be stable finally the minimum applied voltage is only 6 59v it should be noted that the variable voltage in g pedw is far below the constant voltage in u pedw after 10min 4 4 parameters analysis figs 7 a and b indicate the relationship between m c and p c as well as t d with g pedw and u pedw modes the different parameters of g pedw and of u pedw were used the results show that u pedw and g pedw can significantly reduce the m c of sludge the minimum m c under u pedw p c 8mpa m is 100g voltage 36v cm t d 60min and g pedw p c 8mpa m is 100g voltage 36v cm t d 60min can reach 31 17 and 29 07 respectively figs 7 c and d show the relationship between m is and m c of the sludge cake the m c of dewatered sludge cake is both higher than 45 under g pedw and u pedw when m is increases to 200g in addition as shown in fig 7 e by using different voltage and vg values the m c can be lowered to 27 41 and 28 33 under u pedw and g pedw respectively although the dewatering rate of u pedw is faster than that of g pedw in the early stage of dewatering process it slows down with time and the changing trends of m c with the dewatering run are similar in u pedw and g pedw with different voltage and vg values fig 7 f illustrates m c of dewatered sludge cake of three dewatering modes it can be seen that m c from high to low is umdw g pedw and u pedw and the maximum difference of m c between u pedw and umdw is 8 1 at 20min however the maximum difference between g pedw and u pedw is only 4 02 at 60min after 40min of dewatering process m c of umdw almost no longer drops and remains stable while m c of g pedw and u pedw continues to decrease because of the electric field furthermore it can be seen that m c of g pedw and u pedw at 20min is equivalent to that of umdw at 60min it means that the applied electric field can significantly save dewatering time and improve the dewatering efficiency 4 5 energy consumption analysis in order to study the energy consumption of pedw the value of voltage was set to be equal to vg based on eq 3 the energy consumption per unit of removed water can be calculated by the real time electric current voltage and mass of removed water as shown in fig 8 a the energy consumption of u pedw and g pedw increases with enhanced voltage and vg respectively the minimum difference of energy consumption between them is only 33 24wh kg h2o while the maximum difference reaches up to 189 62wh kg h2o on the other hand it can be seen in fig 8 b that minimum m c of u pedw and g pedw is 27 33 and 28 85 respectively the difference of m c between u pedw and g pedw is only 1 52 therefore g pedw mode indicates better dewatering performance with low m c and less energy consumption the electric current for gs pedw and u pedw both increases in the first 20min as shown in fig 8 c this can be attributed to the electrode reaction and the diffusion of charged species through the sludge cake from one electrode to another during this period mahmoud et al 2010 2016 citeau et al 2012 then the dropping f r induces the electric current to decrease after 20min oliver et al 2015 in addition it can be seen that the electric current of u pedw is much higher than that of g pedw and the maximum difference of electric current between them is 250ma fig 8 c indicates that the resistance of sludge cake under u pedw and g pedw both decreases with dewatering time in the first 20min because of the decrement of cake thickness mahmoud et al 2011 and then the resistance increases with time which can be ascribed to the reduction of m c conrardy et al 2016 furthermore as shown in fig 8 d the temperature of g pedw and u pedw will increase during the dewatering process it is important that u pedw can cause numerous joules heating when m c reaches a lower level mahmoud et al 2016 yu et al 2017 because the energy consumption of u pedw is similar to that of thermal drying when m c is less than 55 olivier et al 2015 however the maximum temperature of u pedw reaches to 45 7 c while that of g pedw is only 24 3 c and the temperature of g pedw and u gped in the dewatering process is all below 50 c which cannot meet the needs of solid pyrolysis and moisture evaporation zaker et al 2019 thus the effect of temperature on pore structures was not included here 5 conclusion three dewatering modes ultrahigh pressure mechanical dewatering mode umdw pressurized electro dewatering with constant voltage mode u pedw and constant voltage gradient mode g pedw were performed on a self designed pressurized electro dewatering apparatus for municipal sludge the pore structures and moisture distributions were detected by low field nuclear magnetic resonance technology meanwhile the moisture distributions and quantitative bound strength were analyzed by the thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry test a pore scale electro osmosis model is developed based on the fractal characteristics of the pore size distribution which is available for the prediction of dewatered water in the early stage of electro dewatering experimental results show that the moisture content of dewatered municipal sludge by g pedw and u pedw reaches 28 41 and 27 33 respectively but the energy consumption of g pedw is much lower than that of u pedw the maximum difference of energy consumption reaches up to 189 62wh kg h2o based on the analysis of filtrate flow rate moisture distributions b s as well as pore structure g pedw can remove more water and has higher dewatering efficiency compared with umdw g pedw indicates better dewatering performance with low m

17353,neonicotinoid insecticides nnis are the most extensively used insecticides worldwide threatening ecosystem and human health however nationwide studies of nnis and their metabolites in drinking water are limited in order to characterize the contamination status of nnis in drinking water throughout china we collected 884 drinking water samples including 789 tap water and 95 groundwater samples from 32 provinces covering seven regions of mainland china south central east north northeast northwest and southwest and hong kong ten nnis and six of their main metabolites were determined in the water samples the relative potency factor method was used to assess the cumulative concentrations of nnis and their metabolites imidacloprid equivalent total nnis imieq based on the chronic reference doses crfds of the nnis or the toxic effects of the mataboilites the imieq varied among the studied regions with a median concentration of 24 5 ng l and a maximum concentration of 8 622 ng l the predominant nnis in drinking water were acetamiprid ace and imidacloprid imi compared with tap water derived from groundwater much higher concentrations of imieq and nnis were found in tap water derived from surface water different concentrations and patterns of nnis in drinking water were observed in different regions provinces and capital cities mainly due to regional and provincial differences in crop types and volumes of pesticide usage the concentrations of nnis in the drinking water of provincial capitals and small medium cities were higher than the concentrations in rural areas the estimated daily intake edi of imieq was at least two orders of magnitude lower than the crfd of imi while the nnis in 16 drinking water samples exceeded the acceptable value 100 ng l recommended by the european union this study provided a nationwide profile of the occurrence of nnis and their metabolites in the drinking water of china and the associated potential cumulative human health risks taking into account of the toxicity differences between nnis and their metabolites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water groundwater imidacloprid imidacloprid urea desnitro imidacloprid desmethyl acetamiprid 1 introduction neonicotinoid insecticides nnis are gradually replacing organophosphates carbamates and pyrethroids and have become the most widely used class of insecticides worldwide mainly because of their relatively higher selective toxicity to arthropods and lower toxicity to mammals fish and birds tomizawa and casida 2003 2005 simon delso et al 2015 thompson et al 2020 however a growing number of studies have reported that nnis may exert adverse effects on non target organisms including vertebrate wildlife gibbons et al 2015 bees whitehorn et al 2012 woodcock et al 2017 and aquatic organisms van dijk et al 2013 morrissey et al 2015 the serious threat of nnis on the ecosystem has led to concerns throughout the world the european commission restricted the use of three nnis clothianidin clo imidacloprid imi thiamethoxam thm for seed treatment in 2013 commission 2013 and completely banned their outdoor use in 2018 commission 2018a b c to protect bees in addition to clo imi and thm france even banned the use of acetamiprid ace and thiacloprid thcp not only outdoors but also in greenhouses in 2018 france 2018a b canada has restricted the use of clo imi and thm to protect aquatic invertebrates canada 2018a b and pollinators canada 2019b c d since 2018 the united states u s has also restricted the uses of clo dinotefuran dnt imi and thm to address the ecological and human health risks usepa 2020a b c in addition the netherlands lowered the freshwater quality standard for long term exposure to imi from 67 to 8 3 ng l in 2014 because the mayfly is sensitive to imi rivm 2014 five nnis namely ace clo imi thcp and thm were included in the first and second watch lists for union wide monitoring in the european union pietrzak et al 2019 in vitro and animal studies have shown that nnis may have the potential for endocrine disruption caron beaudoin et al 2017 caron beaudoin et al 2018 developmental neurotoxicity kimura kuroda et al 2012 efsa 2013 and reproductive toxicity gu et al 2013 gonsioroski et al 2020 limited epidemiological studies have reported that proximity to farms using nnis as a measure of exposure was related to congenital heart defects carmichael et al 2014 anencephaly yang et al 2014 and autism spectrum disorders keil et al 2014 urinary n desmethyl acetamiprid dm ace a metabolite of nnis was shown to be correlated with an increased prevalence of neurological symptoms mario et al 2015 in addition some metabolites of nnis have been shown to be more toxic to non target organisms than parent compounds for example imine derivatives of imi and thcp were over 300 and 190 times more toxic to vertebrates respectively based on the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 tomizawa and casida 2000 2005 thus studies on the occurrence of such metabolites are also required because drinking water is an important exposure pathway for humans and conventional water treatment processes cannot effectively remove nnis klarich et al 2017 wan et al 2019 contamination by nnis and their metabolites in drinking water for the public is of concern however only a few studies have reported the occurrence of nnis in tap water including the u s klarich et al 2017 craddock et al 2019 wong et al 2019 southern ontario canada sultana et al 2018 québec canada montiel león et al 2018 wuhan china wan et al 2019 wan et al 2020 hangzhou china lu et al 2020 and northern vietnam wan et al 2021 and only four studies have found measurable metabolites of nnis wan et al 2019 wong et al 2019 wan et al 2020 wan et al 2021 regulations for nni contamination in drinking water are still lacking and nationwide data on nnis in drinking water are not available for china formed by hydrolysis photolysis microbial degradation or duckweed microbial facilitated degradation metabolites of nnis such as desnitro imidacloprid dn imi imidacloprid urea imi urea and dm ace may be present mulligan et al 2016 todey et al 2018 muerdter and lefeyre 2019 in source water therefore a nationwide study of nnis and their metabolites in drinking water is required in china to better understand the contamination status and to provide baseline data for future regulations in china many regions use surface water as the source of tap water although groundwater is the most reliable source of public drinking water in many regions of the world elizalde velázquez and gómez oliván 2020 most residents in cities use tap water sourced from surface water or deep groundwater treated by drinking water plants as drinking water and some residents in rural areas use shallow well water hereinafter groundwater as drinking water without much treatment against this background we conducted a nationwide survey on the occurrence of nnis and their metabolites in drinking water including tap water and groundwater from china we determined seven typical nnis and three new nnis ace clo dnt imi nitenpyram ntp thcp thm flonicamid flo imidaclothiz imit and sulfoxaflor sul in addition six metabolites of nnis were measured including a metabolite of ace dm ace four metabolites of imi dn imi imi urea imidacloprid olefin imi olefin and 5 hydroxy imidacloprid 5 oh imi as well as a metabolite of thm n desmethyl thiamethoxam dm thm furthermore we estimated the human health risks from exposure to nnis in drinking water utilizing a new approach taking the variances between the toxicity of parent nnis and their metabolites into consideration 2 material and methods 2 1 standards and reagents the details of the standards for the sixteen target analytes mentioned above and the isotope labeled internal standards including ace d3 clo d3 dnt d3 imi d4 and thm d4 are presented in table s1 lc ms grade methanol acetonitrile and water were purchased from fisher chemical inc waltham ma usa sodium sulfite was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa all the stock solutions were stored at 20 c 2 2 sample collection in june 2019 we collected 884 drinking water samples including 789 tap water samples and 95 groundwater samples both for drinking water supply from 32 provinces throughout china covering seven regions of mainland china north east northeast central south southwest and northwest and hong kong among the 789 tap water samples 662 were derived from surface water and 127 were derived from deep 60 m groundwater the sampling sites on the mainland covered 139 cities including 32 provincial capitals municipalities pcms 50 small medium cities smcs and 57 rural areas ras fig 1 at least three different districts were included in each sampled city or county drinking water was collected from domestic homes workplaces and public places such as shopping malls parks campuses and restaurants we rinsed the precleaned polyethylene bottle three times with the site drinking water before sampling and then collected 500 ml of water after letting the water flow for 3 min then we transported the water samples at 4 c and extracted them within 48 h each water sample was collected from a different tap or well and lc ms grade water was used for the travel blanks 2 3 sample pretreatment no obvious changes were detected in the concentrations of the target nnis and their metabolites in the tap water samples with the addition of sodium sulfite table s1 wan et al 2020 therefore each water sample 500 ml was spiked with 125 μl of the sodium sulfite solution 20 g l to eliminate the potential residual free chlorine and 50 μl of the isotope labeled internal standard solution mixture of ace d3 clo d3 dnt d3 imi d4 and thm d4 at 100 ng ml to quantify the target analytes the water samples were loaded onto waters oasis hlb cartridges 500 mg 6 ml milford ma usa which were pre conditioned with 5 ml of acetonitrile and 5 ml of water then the cartridges were rinsed with 5 ml of water and vacuum dried for 5 min and the target analytes were eluted with 4 ml of acetonitrile and 4 ml of methanol in sequence finally the eluates were dried under a gentle nitrogen stream at 35 c and reconstituted with 0 5 ml of 30 acetonitrile in water for analysis suspended solids were removed from groundwater samples using nylon filters sun et al 2020 2 4 instrumental analysis chromatographic separation was performed on a waters acquity i class uplc system with a waters acquity uplc hss t3 column 1 8 µm 2 1 mm 100 mm waters corporation milford ma usa maintained at 35 c water with 0 005 formic acid a and acetonitrile b constituted the mobile phase and the separation was achieved using a gradient elution program table s2 the detection was performed on a waters xevo tqs tandem mass spectrometer waters corporation milford ma usa with multiple reaction monitoring mrm in positive electrospray ionization mode details such as the mrm transitions of the target analytes are shown in table s1 2 5 quality assurance and quality control calibration curves consisted of 14 points 0 01 200 ng ml spiked with the internal standards mixture 2 ng for each and the correlation coefficient r of each curve was over 0 998 the travel blanks procedural blanks duplicates and matrix spiked samples 5 ng for each target analyte were analyzed every 25 30 samples the carry over of analytes between the samples and the drift in instrumental sensitivity were monitored after every 10 samples as described elsewhere wan et al 2018 the average recovery rates rrs generated from 35 parallels of the matrix spiked samples ranged from 74 to 123 and the standard deviation of the rrs ranged from 1 6 to 7 3 table s1 the instrumental limit of quantification loq was defined elsewhere wan et al 2019 for the absence of target analytes in the blanks the method detection limits mdls were calculated from the loq by taking into account the sample volume van den eede et al 2015 ranged from 0 01 to 0 2 ng l table s1 2 6 cumulative exposure and risk assessment to better assess the cumulative human exposure to the total nnis we integrated individual nnis and their metabolites detected in drinking water into a single metric imieq imi equivalent total nnis utilizing the relative potency factor rpf approach proposed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2010 chang et al 2018 selecting imi the most abundantly studied in the world as an index compound rpfs were generated by normalizing each nni to imi based on the relative chronic reference dose crfd table s3 imieq was derived using equation 1 1 im i eq rp f k nn i k ng l imi 1 ace 0 80 thm 9 50 clo 5 82 dnt 2 85 thcp 14 3 dm ace 0 80 dm thm 9 50 dn imi 71 3 imi urea 0 81 where k represents the different nnis and metabolites thereof given the lack of crfd for the studied metabolites of nnis and taking the toxicity variances between the parent nnis and their metabolites into consideration we used the half maximal inhibitory concentrations ic50 indicated binding affinity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nachr of imi urea and imi to generate the rpf of imi urea chao and casida 1997 because in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the toxicity of dn imi was similar to that of nicotine ic50 value of 8 2 nm for dn imi vs 7 0 nm for nicotine and a median lethal dose ld50 of 8 mg kg for dn imi vs 7 mg kg for nicotine tomizawa et al 2001 we used the crfd of nicotine 0 8 μg kg bw d to calculate the rpf of dn imi efsa 2009 wan et al 2020 as for dm ace and dm thm we assumed that they share the same rpf value with thecorresponding parent compound because the desmethylation demethylation pathway did not change the electronegative nitro or cyano pharmacophore of ace and thm tomizawa and casida 2003 muerdter and lefeyre 2019 imi olefin 5 oh imi sul imit ntp and flo were excluded from the imieq calculation because of their low detection frequencies dfs lower than 5 we estimated the daily intake edi pg kg body weight bw d of each nni and the imieq via drinking water consumption based on the daily water ingestion rate dwir l kg bw d and the absorption rate ar after oral administration of the corresponding compound to assess human exposure potential using equation 2 2 ed i k c dwir ar 1000 where k represents the nnis and c ng l is the concentration of each nni or imieq in the water samples to assess normal and high exposure scenarios we employed the median and 95th percentile concentrations in the edi calculation respectively the median dwir values were used based on the usepa exposure factors handbook usepa 2011 because in vivo studies demonstrated that the parent nnis including ace jmpr 2011 clo yokota et al 2003 jmpr 2010 dnt jmpr 2012 imi jmpr 2001 thcp jmpr 2006 and thm jmpr 2010 were rapidly and almost completely absorbed 90 after oral dosing in rats we assigned the ar of nnis with a constant value of 100 in addition we assumed that the metabolites share the same value of ar as their corresponding parent nnis because of the lack of toxicological studies of the metabolites of nnis but similar solubility and molecular structures between the parent nnis and their metabolites finally we compared the median and 95th percentile of the edis against the current crfd of imi to evaluate the risk of nnis to human health 2 7 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical analysis system sas statistical software 9 4 version sas institute inc cary usa and excel software version 2019 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa for concentrations less than the mdls we assigned them to zero in the calculation of imieq and σnnis sum of nnis for the analyses of individual chemicals we generated assigned values with the maximum likelihood estimation mle method based on the concentrations above the mdl proportion of the data below mdl and assumed log normal distribution helsel 2005 efsa 2010 field 2011 the descriptive analysis was used to present the occurrence of nnis and imieq in drinking water from china the kruskal wallis test a non parametric test was performed to examine the significant differences in each nni with a detection frequency df above 50 and imieq among various groups such as the seven studied regions or pcms smcs and ras spearman s rank correlation coefficient analysis was performed to explore the correlations between the target analytes with the statistical significance level set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and concentrations of target analytes in drinking water from china table 1 shows the concentrations and dfs of nine nnis four main metabolites of nnis and imieq detected in drinking water including tap water and groundwater in all the water samples the concentrations of the total nnis imieq varied widely ranging from 0 02 to 8 622 ng l with a median value of 24 5 ng l among the nni parent compounds ace df 93 was the most frequently detected compound followed by imi 82 clo 69 and thm 66 while the others were detected with dfs below 50 sul was not detected among the metabolites dm ace 77 imi urea 67 and dn imi 60 were frequently identified whereas dm thm was detected in only 12 of the water samples 5 oh imi and imi olefin were not detectable therefore sul 5 oh imi and imi olefin were not included in further analyses the median concentrations of nnis and metabolites were found in descending order of imi 0 80 ng l ace 0 30 ng l imi urea 0 29 ng l thm 0 22 ng l clo 0 14 ng l dn imi 0 12 ng l and dm ace 0 06 ng l ace imi clo thm dm ace imi urea and dn imi were the major nnis and metabolites found in tap water with dfs above 60 and their median concentrations ranged from 0 08 to 0 86 ng l table 1 whereas ace imi and dm ace were the most frequently detected compounds in groundwater with dfs over 60 generally the highest median concentrations of imieq and individual target analytes were found in surface water derived tap water imieq 57 0 ng l followed by groundwater 3 41 ng l and deep groundwater derived tap water 0 99 ng l table 1 on agricultural lands less than 20 of the active ingredients of nnis can be absorbed into crops over 80 would be spread into the environment such as soils pietrzak et al 2020 surface runoff was responsible for nnis transport into the surface waters pietrzak et al 2020 thus the surface water and shallow wells were more likely to be the primary receivers of nnis than deep groundwater in addition most water treatment plants in china utilize conventional water treatment processes in which no to low amount of nnis could be removed from the water sources klarich et al 2017 wan et al 2019 craddock et al 2019 also determined that the average concentration of imi in groundwater samples was lower than that in treated water samples in china many more formulations containing ace imi and thm as active ingredients were registered for manufacturing than other nnis mahai et al 2019 therefore ace imi and thm were the most frequently detected nnis in surface waters such as the yangtze river mahai et al 2019 and the pearl river yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a in china consistently ace imi thm and dm ace were frequently detected in 100 of the tap water samples from wuhan china wan et al 2019 with median concentrations of 2 78 4 30 3 54 and 0 20 ng l respectively table 2 clo was also frequently detected in china which might be attributed to the fact that clo can also be transformed from thm in the environment simon delso et al 2015 in addition to the contribution of the use of clo itself a good correlation was found between thm and clo in drinking water with a correlation coefficient of 0 859 p 0 001 in our study table s4 dn imi and imi urea were frequently detected in the tap water from wuhan china in july with median concentrations of 3 47 and 1 90 ng l respectively wan et al 2020 compared with other countries the median concentrations of imi 0 86 ng l clo 0 16 ng l and thm 0 28 ng l in the present study were lower than those in tap water from the university of iowa usa imi 3 97 ng l clo 11 9 ng l and thm 0 95 ng l klarich et al 2017 the median values observed in this study could not be compared with those values reported in canada because the medians in their studies were lower than the detection limits table 2 presently ace and dm ace have only been reported in china and vietnam with detectable concentrations table 2 which could be explained by the much lower agricultural use and registered amounts of ace than imi clo and thm in the u s and canada usgs 2016 canada 2019a the median concentrations of dn imi 0 16 ng l and imi urea 0 36 ng l were higher in the present study than those in iowa median 0 03 and 0 06 ng l for dn imi and imi urea respectively wong et al 2019 3 2 regional and provincial differences in the concentrations and patterns of neonicotinoid insecticides fig 2 illustrates the regional a and provincial b differences in the concentrations and contamination patterns of nnis in drinking water samples as shown in fig 2a drinking water from south china was the most heavily polluted by nnis with σnnis of 27 6 ng l followed by central china 8 07 ng l east china 7 39 ng l southwest china 3 28 ng l northeast china 1 16 ng l northwest china 0 25 ng l and north china 0 20 ng l table s5 as shown in fig 2b the concentrations of nnis in drinking water varied in different provinces drinking water from guangxi province located in south china had the highest σnnis of 98 9 ng l followed by hunan province 42 8 ng l central china guangdong province 42 4 ng l south china shanghai 38 8 ng l east china and other provinces less than 30 ng l table s6 for the capital cities of each province nanning guangxi had the highest σnnis of 321 ng l followed by guangzhou guangdong 69 9 ng l nanchang jiangxi 58 4 ng l changsha hunan 49 8 ng l shanghai 34 9 ng l nanjing jiangsu 30 6 ng l wuhan hubei 29 9 ng l and other capital cities fig s1 different contamination patterns of nnis were observed in various regions and provinces fig 2a shows that clo imi and thm are the predominant nnis in south china central china and southwest china while ace imi and thm are the major nnis in east china and northeast china ace and imi are the most significant nnis in northwest china and north china currently the exact application volumes of nnis in different regions of china are not available guangxi has the highest crop production volume in china and the information of pesticide usage by volume per unit of land area and planting area per unit of land area in each province in china in 2018 indicates that the provinces in south central and east china are among the top consumers in china fig s2 and supporting information 2 which may explain the higher concentrations of nnis observed in these areas in addition from the china statistical yearbook 2019 fig s3 nbsc 2019 there are different agricultural crop planting structures in different provinces and regions which might explain the varied concentrations and patterns of nni contamination in drinking water observed in different provinces and regions from the website of china pesticide information network fig s4 cpin 2019 nnis registered in china are mostly used for rice and wheat and relatively small amounts of nnis are used in other agricultural crops such as corn fruit trees vegetables peanuts and rapeseed therefore the provinces or regions that planted predominantly rice and wheat tend to have higher nnis in the drinking water samples for example rice and sugarcane are the main crops in guangxi rice is the main crop in guangdong in south china hunan in central china and jiangxi fujian zhejiang and shanghai in east china rice and wheat are the primary crops in hubei in central china and in jiangsu and anhui in east china rice corn and potatoes are the predominant crops in sichuan yunnan guizhou and chongqing in southwest china the provinces mentioned above demonstrated higher nnis in drinking water however the provinces and regions that planted mostly corn or other crops have relatively lower nnis in drinking water for example liaoning heilongjiang and jilin provinces which are located in northeast china mainly planted corn henan planted mostly wheat corn and peanuts corn and wheat are the most substantial crops in north china including beijing tianjin hebei shanxi and inner mongolia and in northwest china including shaanxi gansu and ningxia and shandong in east china cotton is the predominant crop in xinjiang and rapeseed is the main crop in qinghai and tibet fig s3 3 3 differences in neonicotinoid insecticides in drinking water and tap water in the three types of communities overall nnis in drinking water from pcms were much higher than those in ras fig 3 fig 3a presents the differences in nnis dfs 50 in drinking water among the three types of communities ace in drinking water from pcms median 0 52 ng l was significantly higher than that from smcs 0 33 ng l and ras 0 08 ng l with significantly higher ace in smcs than in ras clo imi and dm ace were higher in pcms 0 16 0 78 and 0 08 ng l respectively than in ras 0 11 0 53 and 0 04 ng l thm and imi urea in both pcms 0 38 and 0 40 ng l and smcs 0 26 and 0 32 ng l were higher than those in ras 0 04ng l and 0 05 ng l table s7 in tap water only ace in pcms was significantly higher than that in ras with no significant differences between other nnis and the total nnis among pcms smcs and ras were observed fig 3b this may be because the other nnis contamination levels in surface water derived tap water samples in ras were similar to those in pcms and smcs table s7 while drinking water samples in ras contained more groundwater samples in which the concentrations of nnis were lower than those in tap water table 1 in china cities usually use surface water as tap water sources while in some rural areas groundwater is the predominant drinking water source in the present study drinking water samples in pcms and smcs mainly consisted of tap water derived from surface water 82 6 but water samples of ras were 41 4 groundwater supporting information 2 the concentrations of nnis and their metabolites in surface water derived tap water were much higher than those of groundwater derived tap water and groundwater directly for drinking water supply table 1 in addition population density in larger cities was higher than that in rural areas which leads to a higher demand of crop supply higher density of planting areas and higher volume of pesticide usage around larger cities than in remote rural areas 3 4 human exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides via water ingestion to assess human exposure to nnis through drinking water consumption in china the edis of each nni and the total nnis imieq were estimated for different age groups including infants 1 year toddlers 1 3 years children 4 11 years teenagers 11 20 years and adults 21 years fig 4 and table s8 for both normal median and high 95th percentile scenarios infants toddlers and children had higher potential edis than teenagers and adults via drinking water ingestion due to the variations in daily water ingestion rate for different age groups for example the edis of imieq for infants toddlers and children with median values of 2 250 760 and 711 pg kg bw d respectively were higher than those for teenagers and adults median 392 and 490 pg kg bw d respectively table s8 in addition the median edis of imieq varied widely among the seven different regions across china for each age group and the highest values were observed in central china fig 4 due to the varied median levels of imieq in the regions the edi of imieq for infants under the high scenario 95th percentile 59 0 ng kg bw d table s8 was 3 orders of magnitude lower than the crfd of imi 57 000 ng kg bw d enacted by the usepa table s3 in guangxi the most heavily polluted province the edi of imieq 95th percentile for infants 266 ng kg bw d was 2 orders of magnitude lower than the crfd of imi table s9 however nnis can be ingested by humans through diverse pathways such as water ingestion food ingestion dust ingestion and inhalation table s9 and drinking water ingestion is a significant exposure pathway compared with dust ingestion and inhalation chen et al 2019 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b zhou et al 2020 the conclusion of the risk assessment based on the current crfd should be drawn cautiously as recent studies have demonstrated that imi can pose adverse health effects on animals at much lower levels even below the currently recommended no observed adverse effect level noael bal et al 2012 sun et al 2016 burke et al 2018 therefore a downward adjustment of crfd of imi is expected in the future in addition concerning the guideline for a single pesticide 100 ng l in drinking water recommended by the european union commission 1998 nnis in some drinking water samples n 16 from guangxi henan jiangxi shandong guangdong and jilin provinces in this study exceeded this guideline value table s10 suggesting potential risks to human health for crop production sum of production for rice corn wheat soybean and sugarcane planting area and volume of pesticide usage in each province in china in 2018 henan guangdong shandong jilin jiangxi and guangxi provinces ranked the highest for example guangxi was the highest for crop production henan and shandong were on the top two for volume of pesticide usage fig s2 and supporting information 2 thus further studies on nnis in drinking water and related potential health risks of nni exposure for sensitive populations children and pregnant women are required in the provinces with relatively heavy contamination because fetal and early postnatal exposure to imi has led to lasting effects on behavior and brain function in mice burke et al 2018 many potential degradation products of nnis such as decyano ace decyano thcp desnitro thm desnitro clo desnitro dnt thm urea clo urea and dnt urea were not included in this study but it is necessary to include these compounds to better depict the compositional profile of nnis given the lack of crfd for the metabolites the estimated daily intake of nnis through water ingestion may not be accurate the limited sample sizes in this study may not be representative enough to illustrate the contamination profile of nnis in the studied provinces because there are numerous cities counties towns and villages in each specific province furthermore seasonal variations were not considered in this study either finally the assumption on the absorption rates of the major neonicotinoid metabolites may not be accurate enough due to the lack of animal studies 4 conclusions this is the first nationwide study on the occurrence of nnis and a selection of metabolites in drinking water in china ace clo imi thm dm ace dn imi and imi urea were frequently detected in the drinking water the highest concentrations of nnis were found in surface water derived tap water followed by groundwater and deep groundwater derived tap water the contamination levels and patterns of nnis in drinking water varied considerably by region and province total nnis in pcms and smcs were significantly higher than in ras for drinking water substantially more ace was found in pcms than in ras for both drinking water and tap water potential exposure via drinking water ingestion and food consumption were important potential exposure pathways compared to dust ingestion and air inhalation among all age groups the edi of imieq was at least two orders of magnitude lower than the crfd of imi however more attention should be paid to the risk of human exposure to nnis in that nnis in drinking water samples from some provinces exceeded the guideline limit for a single pesticide in the drinking water 100 ng l regulated by the european union further studies are needed to focus on the risk assessment of human exposure to nnis especially for fetuses

17353,neonicotinoid insecticides nnis are the most extensively used insecticides worldwide threatening ecosystem and human health however nationwide studies of nnis and their metabolites in drinking water are limited in order to characterize the contamination status of nnis in drinking water throughout china we collected 884 drinking water samples including 789 tap water and 95 groundwater samples from 32 provinces covering seven regions of mainland china south central east north northeast northwest and southwest and hong kong ten nnis and six of their main metabolites were determined in the water samples the relative potency factor method was used to assess the cumulative concentrations of nnis and their metabolites imidacloprid equivalent total nnis imieq based on the chronic reference doses crfds of the nnis or the toxic effects of the mataboilites the imieq varied among the studied regions with a median concentration of 24 5 ng l and a maximum concentration of 8 622 ng l the predominant nnis in drinking water were acetamiprid ace and imidacloprid imi compared with tap water derived from groundwater much higher concentrations of imieq and nnis were found in tap water derived from surface water different concentrations and patterns of nnis in drinking water were observed in different regions provinces and capital cities mainly due to regional and provincial differences in crop types and volumes of pesticide usage the concentrations of nnis in the drinking water of provincial capitals and small medium cities were higher than the concentrations in rural areas the estimated daily intake edi of imieq was at least two orders of magnitude lower than the crfd of imi while the nnis in 16 drinking water samples exceeded the acceptable value 100 ng l recommended by the european union this study provided a nationwide profile of the occurrence of nnis and their metabolites in the drinking water of china and the associated potential cumulative human health risks taking into account of the toxicity differences between nnis and their metabolites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water groundwater imidacloprid imidacloprid urea desnitro imidacloprid desmethyl acetamiprid 1 introduction neonicotinoid insecticides nnis are gradually replacing organophosphates carbamates and pyrethroids and have become the most widely used class of insecticides worldwide mainly because of their relatively higher selective toxicity to arthropods and lower toxicity to mammals fish and birds tomizawa and casida 2003 2005 simon delso et al 2015 thompson et al 2020 however a growing number of studies have reported that nnis may exert adverse effects on non target organisms including vertebrate wildlife gibbons et al 2015 bees whitehorn et al 2012 woodcock et al 2017 and aquatic organisms van dijk et al 2013 morrissey et al 2015 the serious threat of nnis on the ecosystem has led to concerns throughout the world the european commission restricted the use of three nnis clothianidin clo imidacloprid imi thiamethoxam thm for seed treatment in 2013 commission 2013 and completely banned their outdoor use in 2018 commission 2018a b c to protect bees in addition to clo imi and thm france even banned the use of acetamiprid ace and thiacloprid thcp not only outdoors but also in greenhouses in 2018 france 2018a b canada has restricted the use of clo imi and thm to protect aquatic invertebrates canada 2018a b and pollinators canada 2019b c d since 2018 the united states u s has also restricted the uses of clo dinotefuran dnt imi and thm to address the ecological and human health risks usepa 2020a b c in addition the netherlands lowered the freshwater quality standard for long term exposure to imi from 67 to 8 3 ng l in 2014 because the mayfly is sensitive to imi rivm 2014 five nnis namely ace clo imi thcp and thm were included in the first and second watch lists for union wide monitoring in the european union pietrzak et al 2019 in vitro and animal studies have shown that nnis may have the potential for endocrine disruption caron beaudoin et al 2017 caron beaudoin et al 2018 developmental neurotoxicity kimura kuroda et al 2012 efsa 2013 and reproductive toxicity gu et al 2013 gonsioroski et al 2020 limited epidemiological studies have reported that proximity to farms using nnis as a measure of exposure was related to congenital heart defects carmichael et al 2014 anencephaly yang et al 2014 and autism spectrum disorders keil et al 2014 urinary n desmethyl acetamiprid dm ace a metabolite of nnis was shown to be correlated with an increased prevalence of neurological symptoms mario et al 2015 in addition some metabolites of nnis have been shown to be more toxic to non target organisms than parent compounds for example imine derivatives of imi and thcp were over 300 and 190 times more toxic to vertebrates respectively based on the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 tomizawa and casida 2000 2005 thus studies on the occurrence of such metabolites are also required because drinking water is an important exposure pathway for humans and conventional water treatment processes cannot effectively remove nnis klarich et al 2017 wan et al 2019 contamination by nnis and their metabolites in drinking water for the public is of concern however only a few studies have reported the occurrence of nnis in tap water including the u s klarich et al 2017 craddock et al 2019 wong et al 2019 southern ontario canada sultana et al 2018 québec canada montiel león et al 2018 wuhan china wan et al 2019 wan et al 2020 hangzhou china lu et al 2020 and northern vietnam wan et al 2021 and only four studies have found measurable metabolites of nnis wan et al 2019 wong et al 2019 wan et al 2020 wan et al 2021 regulations for nni contamination in drinking water are still lacking and nationwide data on nnis in drinking water are not available for china formed by hydrolysis photolysis microbial degradation or duckweed microbial facilitated degradation metabolites of nnis such as desnitro imidacloprid dn imi imidacloprid urea imi urea and dm ace may be present mulligan et al 2016 todey et al 2018 muerdter and lefeyre 2019 in source water therefore a nationwide study of nnis and their metabolites in drinking water is required in china to better understand the contamination status and to provide baseline data for future regulations in china many regions use surface water as the source of tap water although groundwater is the most reliable source of public drinking water in many regions of the world elizalde velázquez and gómez oliván 2020 most residents in cities use tap water sourced from surface water or deep groundwater treated by drinking water plants as drinking water and some residents in rural areas use shallow well water hereinafter groundwater as drinking water without much treatment against this background we conducted a nationwide survey on the occurrence of nnis and their metabolites in drinking water including tap water and groundwater from china we determined seven typical nnis and three new nnis ace clo dnt imi nitenpyram ntp thcp thm flonicamid flo imidaclothiz imit and sulfoxaflor sul in addition six metabolites of nnis were measured including a metabolite of ace dm ace four metabolites of imi dn imi imi urea imidacloprid olefin imi olefin and 5 hydroxy imidacloprid 5 oh imi as well as a metabolite of thm n desmethyl thiamethoxam dm thm furthermore we estimated the human health risks from exposure to nnis in drinking water utilizing a new approach taking the variances between the toxicity of parent nnis and their metabolites into consideration 2 material and methods 2 1 standards and reagents the details of the standards for the sixteen target analytes mentioned above and the isotope labeled internal standards including ace d3 clo d3 dnt d3 imi d4 and thm d4 are presented in table s1 lc ms grade methanol acetonitrile and water were purchased from fisher chemical inc waltham ma usa sodium sulfite was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa all the stock solutions were stored at 20 c 2 2 sample collection in june 2019 we collected 884 drinking water samples including 789 tap water samples and 95 groundwater samples both for drinking water supply from 32 provinces throughout china covering seven regions of mainland china north east northeast central south southwest and northwest and hong kong among the 789 tap water samples 662 were derived from surface water and 127 were derived from deep 60 m groundwater the sampling sites on the mainland covered 139 cities including 32 provincial capitals municipalities pcms 50 small medium cities smcs and 57 rural areas ras fig 1 at least three different districts were included in each sampled city or county drinking water was collected from domestic homes workplaces and public places such as shopping malls parks campuses and restaurants we rinsed the precleaned polyethylene bottle three times with the site drinking water before sampling and then collected 500 ml of water after letting the water flow for 3 min then we transported the water samples at 4 c and extracted them within 48 h each water sample was collected from a different tap or well and lc ms grade water was used for the travel blanks 2 3 sample pretreatment no obvious changes were detected in the concentrations of the target nnis and their metabolites in the tap water samples with the addition of sodium sulfite table s1 wan et al 2020 therefore each water sample 500 ml was spiked with 125 μl of the sodium sulfite solution 20 g l to eliminate the potential residual free chlorine and 50 μl of the isotope labeled internal standard solution mixture of ace d3 clo d3 dnt d3 imi d4 and thm d4 at 100 ng ml to quantify the target analytes the water samples were loaded onto waters oasis hlb cartridges 500 mg 6 ml milford ma usa which were pre conditioned with 5 ml of acetonitrile and 5 ml of water then the cartridges were rinsed with 5 ml of water and vacuum dried for 5 min and the target analytes were eluted with 4 ml of acetonitrile and 4 ml of methanol in sequence finally the eluates were dried under a gentle nitrogen stream at 35 c and reconstituted with 0 5 ml of 30 acetonitrile in water for analysis suspended solids were removed from groundwater samples using nylon filters sun et al 2020 2 4 instrumental analysis chromatographic separation was performed on a waters acquity i class uplc system with a waters acquity uplc hss t3 column 1 8 µm 2 1 mm 100 mm waters corporation milford ma usa maintained at 35 c water with 0 005 formic acid a and acetonitrile b constituted the mobile phase and the separation was achieved using a gradient elution program table s2 the detection was performed on a waters xevo tqs tandem mass spectrometer waters corporation milford ma usa with multiple reaction monitoring mrm in positive electrospray ionization mode details such as the mrm transitions of the target analytes are shown in table s1 2 5 quality assurance and quality control calibration curves consisted of 14 points 0 01 200 ng ml spiked with the internal standards mixture 2 ng for each and the correlation coefficient r of each curve was over 0 998 the travel blanks procedural blanks duplicates and matrix spiked samples 5 ng for each target analyte were analyzed every 25 30 samples the carry over of analytes between the samples and the drift in instrumental sensitivity were monitored after every 10 samples as described elsewhere wan et al 2018 the average recovery rates rrs generated from 35 parallels of the matrix spiked samples ranged from 74 to 123 and the standard deviation of the rrs ranged from 1 6 to 7 3 table s1 the instrumental limit of quantification loq was defined elsewhere wan et al 2019 for the absence of target analytes in the blanks the method detection limits mdls were calculated from the loq by taking into account the sample volume van den eede et al 2015 ranged from 0 01 to 0 2 ng l table s1 2 6 cumulative exposure and risk assessment to better assess the cumulative human exposure to the total nnis we integrated individual nnis and their metabolites detected in drinking water into a single metric imieq imi equivalent total nnis utilizing the relative potency factor rpf approach proposed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2010 chang et al 2018 selecting imi the most abundantly studied in the world as an index compound rpfs were generated by normalizing each nni to imi based on the relative chronic reference dose crfd table s3 imieq was derived using equation 1 1 im i eq rp f k nn i k ng l imi 1 ace 0 80 thm 9 50 clo 5 82 dnt 2 85 thcp 14 3 dm ace 0 80 dm thm 9 50 dn imi 71 3 imi urea 0 81 where k represents the different nnis and metabolites thereof given the lack of crfd for the studied metabolites of nnis and taking the toxicity variances between the parent nnis and their metabolites into consideration we used the half maximal inhibitory concentrations ic50 indicated binding affinity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nachr of imi urea and imi to generate the rpf of imi urea chao and casida 1997 because in vitro and in vivo studies showed that the toxicity of dn imi was similar to that of nicotine ic50 value of 8 2 nm for dn imi vs 7 0 nm for nicotine and a median lethal dose ld50 of 8 mg kg for dn imi vs 7 mg kg for nicotine tomizawa et al 2001 we used the crfd of nicotine 0 8 μg kg bw d to calculate the rpf of dn imi efsa 2009 wan et al 2020 as for dm ace and dm thm we assumed that they share the same rpf value with thecorresponding parent compound because the desmethylation demethylation pathway did not change the electronegative nitro or cyano pharmacophore of ace and thm tomizawa and casida 2003 muerdter and lefeyre 2019 imi olefin 5 oh imi sul imit ntp and flo were excluded from the imieq calculation because of their low detection frequencies dfs lower than 5 we estimated the daily intake edi pg kg body weight bw d of each nni and the imieq via drinking water consumption based on the daily water ingestion rate dwir l kg bw d and the absorption rate ar after oral administration of the corresponding compound to assess human exposure potential using equation 2 2 ed i k c dwir ar 1000 where k represents the nnis and c ng l is the concentration of each nni or imieq in the water samples to assess normal and high exposure scenarios we employed the median and 95th percentile concentrations in the edi calculation respectively the median dwir values were used based on the usepa exposure factors handbook usepa 2011 because in vivo studies demonstrated that the parent nnis including ace jmpr 2011 clo yokota et al 2003 jmpr 2010 dnt jmpr 2012 imi jmpr 2001 thcp jmpr 2006 and thm jmpr 2010 were rapidly and almost completely absorbed 90 after oral dosing in rats we assigned the ar of nnis with a constant value of 100 in addition we assumed that the metabolites share the same value of ar as their corresponding parent nnis because of the lack of toxicological studies of the metabolites of nnis but similar solubility and molecular structures between the parent nnis and their metabolites finally we compared the median and 95th percentile of the edis against the current crfd of imi to evaluate the risk of nnis to human health 2 7 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical analysis system sas statistical software 9 4 version sas institute inc cary usa and excel software version 2019 microsoft corporation redmond wa usa for concentrations less than the mdls we assigned them to zero in the calculation of imieq and σnnis sum of nnis for the analyses of individual chemicals we generated assigned values with the maximum likelihood estimation mle method based on the concentrations above the mdl proportion of the data below mdl and assumed log normal distribution helsel 2005 efsa 2010 field 2011 the descriptive analysis was used to present the occurrence of nnis and imieq in drinking water from china the kruskal wallis test a non parametric test was performed to examine the significant differences in each nni with a detection frequency df above 50 and imieq among various groups such as the seven studied regions or pcms smcs and ras spearman s rank correlation coefficient analysis was performed to explore the correlations between the target analytes with the statistical significance level set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and concentrations of target analytes in drinking water from china table 1 shows the concentrations and dfs of nine nnis four main metabolites of nnis and imieq detected in drinking water including tap water and groundwater in all the water samples the concentrations of the total nnis imieq varied widely ranging from 0 02 to 8 622 ng l with a median value of 24 5 ng l among the nni parent compounds ace df 93 was the most frequently detected compound followed by imi 82 clo 69 and thm 66 while the others were detected with dfs below 50 sul was not detected among the metabolites dm ace 77 imi urea 67 and dn imi 60 were frequently identified whereas dm thm was detected in only 12 of the water samples 5 oh imi and imi olefin were not detectable therefore sul 5 oh imi and imi olefin were not included in further analyses the median concentrations of nnis and metabolites were found in descending order of imi 0 80 ng l ace 0 30 ng l imi urea 0 29 ng l thm 0 22 ng l clo 0 14 ng l dn imi 0 12 ng l and dm ace 0 06 ng l ace imi clo thm dm ace imi urea and dn imi were the major nnis and metabolites found in tap water with dfs above 60 and their median concentrations ranged from 0 08 to 0 86 ng l table 1 whereas ace imi and dm ace were the most frequently detected compounds in groundwater with dfs over 60 generally the highest median concentrations of imieq and individual target analytes were found in surface water derived tap water imieq 57 0 ng l followed by groundwater 3 41 ng l and deep groundwater derived tap water 0 99 ng l table 1 on agricultural lands less than 20 of the active ingredients of nnis can be absorbed into crops over 80 would be spread into the environment such as soils pietrzak et al 2020 surface runoff was responsible for nnis transport into the surface waters pietrzak et al 2020 thus the surface water and shallow wells were more likely to be the primary receivers of nnis than deep groundwater in addition most water treatment plants in china utilize conventional water treatment processes in which no to low amount of nnis could be removed from the water sources klarich et al 2017 wan et al 2019 craddock et al 2019 also determined that the average concentration of imi in groundwater samples was lower than that in treated water samples in china many more formulations containing ace imi and thm as active ingredients were registered for manufacturing than other nnis mahai et al 2019 therefore ace imi and thm were the most frequently detected nnis in surface waters such as the yangtze river mahai et al 2019 and the pearl river yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a in china consistently ace imi thm and dm ace were frequently detected in 100 of the tap water samples from wuhan china wan et al 2019 with median concentrations of 2 78 4 30 3 54 and 0 20 ng l respectively table 2 clo was also frequently detected in china which might be attributed to the fact that clo can also be transformed from thm in the environment simon delso et al 2015 in addition to the contribution of the use of clo itself a good correlation was found between thm and clo in drinking water with a correlation coefficient of 0 859 p 0 001 in our study table s4 dn imi and imi urea were frequently detected in the tap water from wuhan china in july with median concentrations of 3 47 and 1 90 ng l respectively wan et al 2020 compared with other countries the median concentrations of imi 0 86 ng l clo 0 16 ng l and thm 0 28 ng l in the present study were lower than those in tap water from the university of iowa usa imi 3 97 ng l clo 11 9 ng l and thm 0 95 ng l klarich et al 2017 the median values observed in this study could not be compared with those values reported in canada because the medians in their studies were lower than the detection limits table 2 presently ace and dm ace have only been reported in china and vietnam with detectable concentrations table 2 which could be explained by the much lower agricultural use and registered amounts of ace than imi clo and thm in the u s and canada usgs 2016 canada 2019a the median concentrations of dn imi 0 16 ng l and imi urea 0 36 ng l were higher in the present study than those in iowa median 0 03 and 0 06 ng l for dn imi and imi urea respectively wong et al 2019 3 2 regional and provincial differences in the concentrations and patterns of neonicotinoid insecticides fig 2 illustrates the regional a and provincial b differences in the concentrations and contamination patterns of nnis in drinking water samples as shown in fig 2a drinking water from south china was the most heavily polluted by nnis with σnnis of 27 6 ng l followed by central china 8 07 ng l east china 7 39 ng l southwest china 3 28 ng l northeast china 1 16 ng l northwest china 0 25 ng l and north china 0 20 ng l table s5 as shown in fig 2b the concentrations of nnis in drinking water varied in different provinces drinking water from guangxi province located in south china had the highest σnnis of 98 9 ng l followed by hunan province 42 8 ng l central china guangdong province 42 4 ng l south china shanghai 38 8 ng l east china and other provinces less than 30 ng l table s6 for the capital cities of each province nanning guangxi had the highest σnnis of 321 ng l followed by guangzhou guangdong 69 9 ng l nanchang jiangxi 58 4 ng l changsha hunan 49 8 ng l shanghai 34 9 ng l nanjing jiangsu 30 6 ng l wuhan hubei 29 9 ng l and other capital cities fig s1 different contamination patterns of nnis were observed in various regions and provinces fig 2a shows that clo imi and thm are the predominant nnis in south china central china and southwest china while ace imi and thm are the major nnis in east china and northeast china ace and imi are the most significant nnis in northwest china and north china currently the exact application volumes of nnis in different regions of china are not available guangxi has the highest crop production volume in china and the information of pesticide usage by volume per unit of land area and planting area per unit of land area in each province in china in 2018 indicates that the provinces in south central and east china are among the top consumers in china fig s2 and supporting information 2 which may explain the higher concentrations of nnis observed in these areas in addition from the china statistical yearbook 2019 fig s3 nbsc 2019 there are different agricultural crop planting structures in different provinces and regions which might explain the varied concentrations and patterns of nni contamination in drinking water observed in different provinces and regions from the website of china pesticide information network fig s4 cpin 2019 nnis registered in china are mostly used for rice and wheat and relatively small amounts of nnis are used in other agricultural crops such as corn fruit trees vegetables peanuts and rapeseed therefore the provinces or regions that planted predominantly rice and wheat tend to have higher nnis in the drinking water samples for example rice and sugarcane are the main crops in guangxi rice is the main crop in guangdong in south china hunan in central china and jiangxi fujian zhejiang and shanghai in east china rice and wheat are the primary crops in hubei in central china and in jiangsu and anhui in east china rice corn and potatoes are the predominant crops in sichuan yunnan guizhou and chongqing in southwest china the provinces mentioned above demonstrated higher nnis in drinking water however the provinces and regions that planted mostly corn or other crops have relatively lower nnis in drinking water for example liaoning heilongjiang and jilin provinces which are located in northeast china mainly planted corn henan planted mostly wheat corn and peanuts corn and wheat are the most substantial crops in north china including beijing tianjin hebei shanxi and inner mongolia and in northwest china including shaanxi gansu and ningxia and shandong in east china cotton is the predominant crop in xinjiang and rapeseed is the main crop in qinghai and tibet fig s3 3 3 differences in neonicotinoid insecticides in drinking water and tap water in the three types of communities overall nnis in drinking water from pcms were much higher than those in ras fig 3 fig 3a presents the differences in nnis dfs 50 in drinking water among the three types of communities ace in drinking water from pcms median 0 52 ng l was significantly higher than that from smcs 0 33 ng l and ras 0 08 ng l with significantly higher ace in smcs than in ras clo imi and dm ace were higher in pcms 0 16 0 78 and 0 08 ng l respectively than in ras 0 11 0 53 and 0 04 ng l thm and imi urea in both pcms 0 38 and 0 40 ng l and smcs 0 26 and 0 32 ng l were higher than those in ras 0 04ng l and 0 05 ng l table s7 in tap water only ace in pcms was significantly higher than that in ras with no significant differences between other nnis and the total nnis among pcms smcs and ras were observed fig 3b this may be because the other nnis contamination levels in surface water derived tap water samples in ras were similar to those in pcms and smcs table s7 while drinking water samples in ras contained more groundwater samples in which the concentrations of nnis were lower than those in tap water table 1 in china cities usually use surface water as tap water sources while in some rural areas groundwater is the predominant drinking water source in the present study drinking water samples in pcms and smcs mainly consisted of tap water derived from surface water 82 6 but water samples of ras were 41 4 groundwater supporting information 2 the concentrations of nnis and their metabolites in surface water derived tap water were much higher than those of groundwater derived tap water and groundwater directly for drinking water supply table 1 in addition population density in larger cities was higher than that in rural areas which leads to a higher demand of crop supply higher density of planting areas and higher volume of pesticide usage around larger cities than in remote rural areas 3 4 human exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides via water ingestion to assess human exposure to nnis through drinking water consumption in china the edis of each nni and the total nnis imieq were estimated for different age groups including infants 1 year toddlers 1 3 years children 4 11 years teenagers 11 20 years and adults 21 years fig 4 and table s8 for both normal median and high 95th percentile scenarios infants toddlers and children had higher potential edis than teenagers and adults via drinking water ingestion due to the variations in daily water ingestion rate for different age groups for example the edis of imieq for infants toddlers and children with median values of 2 250 760 and 711 pg kg bw d respectively were higher than those for teenagers and adults median 392 and 490 pg kg bw d respectively table s8 in addition the median edis of imieq varied widely among the seven different regions across china for each age group and the highest values were observed in central china fig 4 due to the varied median levels of imieq in the regions the edi of imieq for infants under the high scenario 95th percentile 59 0 ng kg bw d table s8 was 3 orders of magnitude lower than the crfd of imi 57 000 ng kg bw d enacted by the usepa table s3 in guangxi the most heavily polluted province the edi of imieq 95th percentile for infants 266 ng kg bw d was 2 orders of magnitude lower than the crfd of imi table s9 however nnis can be ingested by humans through diverse pathways such as water ingestion food ingestion dust ingestion and inhalation table s9 and drinking water ingestion is a significant exposure pathway compared with dust ingestion and inhalation chen et al 2019 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b zhou et al 2020 the conclusion of the risk assessment based on the current crfd should be drawn cautiously as recent studies have demonstrated that imi can pose adverse health effects on animals at much lower levels even below the currently recommended no observed adverse effect level noael bal et al 2012 sun et al 2016 burke et al 2018 therefore a downward adjustment of crfd of imi is expected in the future in addition concerning the guideline for a single pesticide 100 ng l in drinking water recommended by the european union commission 1998 nnis in some drinking water samples n 16 from guangxi henan jiangxi shandong guangdong and jilin provinces in this study exceeded this guideline value table s10 suggesting potential risks to human health for crop production sum of production for rice corn wheat soybean and sugarcane planting area and volume of pesticide usage in each province in china in 2018 henan guangdong shandong jilin jiangxi and guangxi provinces ranked the highest for example guangxi was the highest for crop production henan and shandong were on the top two for volume of pesticide usage fig s2 and supporting information 2 thus further studies on nnis in drinking water and related potential health risks of nni exposure for sensitive populations children and pregnant women are required in the provinces with relatively heavy contamination because fetal and early postnatal exposure to imi has led to lasting effects on behavior and brain function in mice burke et al 2018 many potential degradation products of nnis such as decyano ace decyano thcp desnitro thm desnitro clo desnitro dnt thm urea clo urea and dnt urea were not included in this study but it is necessary to include these compounds to better depict the compositional profile of nnis given the lack of crfd for the metabolites the estimated daily intake of nnis through water ingestion may not be accurate the limited sample sizes in this study may not be representative enough to illustrate the contamination profile of nnis in the studied provinces because there are numerous cities counties towns and villages in each specific province furthermore seasonal variations were not considered in this study either finally the assumption on the absorption rates of the major neonicotinoid metabolites may not be accurate enough due to the lack of animal studies 4 conclusions this is the first nationwide study on the occurrence of nnis and a selection of metabolites in drinking water in china ace clo imi thm dm ace dn imi and imi urea were frequently detected in the drinking water the highest concentrations of nnis were found in surface water derived tap water followed by groundwater and deep groundwater derived tap water the contamination levels and patterns of nnis in drinking water varied considerably by region and province total nnis in pcms and smcs were significantly higher than in ras for drinking water substantially more ace was found in pcms than in ras for both drinking water and tap water potential exposure via drinking water ingestion and food consumption were important potential exposure pathways compared to dust ingestion and air inhalation among all age groups the edi of imieq was at least two orders of magnitude lower than the crfd of imi however more attention should be paid to the risk of human exposure to nnis in that nnis in drinking water samples from some provinces exceeded the guideline limit for a single pesticide in the drinking water 100 ng l regulated by the european union further studies are needed to focus on the risk assessment of human exposure to nnis especially for fetuses

17354,vibrio parahaemolyticus v p is an epidemiologically significant pathogen that thrives in coastal waters where oysters are harvested posing high risks to human health and shellfish industry and requiring effective forecasting models for emergency preparedness and interventions this study sought to develop forecasting models with differing lead times which are able to predict the level of v p in oysters in advance to mitigate the health risk to the general public and the economic loss to the shellfish industry the random forest method along with 227 sampling datasets from two different geographic locations were utilized to 1 identify the most critical environmental predictors controlling the level of v p in oysters 2 select the most important time lags for the environmental predictors as model input variables and 3 develop four forecasting models rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day with the lead time of one to four days the uncertainty involved in model predictions was quantified using the bootstrapping method results showed that v p abundance in oysters is controlled by antecedent environmental conditions 1 11 days before the antecedent environmental conditions can be described using time lagged sea surface temperature sst and salinity the v p abundance can well be forecasted 1 4 days in advance using the four models the performance of the models decreases with increasing lead time the rf 3day and rf 4day models can be employed primarily for emergency preparedness due to their relatively long lead time while the rf 1day and rf 2day models can be used primarily for management interventions due to their relatively high predictive performance keywords vibrio parahaemolyticus random forest forecasting models 1 introduction vibrio parahaemolyticus v p is a gram negative and halophilic bacterium that thrives in coastal waters davis et al 2017 zimmerman et al 2007 where oysters are commonly harvested v p is also an epidemiologically significant pathogen that is the leading cause of seafood borne illnesses associated with the consumption of raw seafood especially shellfish harvested from warm water estuaries daniels et al 2000 levy 2018 oysters are natural filter feeders facilitating the concentration of v p in oyster tissues wang and deng 2016 oliver 2015 human exposure to v p may cause gastroenteritis wound infections and septicemia depending on virulent strains and exposure routes v p has several virulence factors including adhesins thermostable direct hemolysin tdh and tdh related hemolysin trh in addition to two type iii secretion systems to survive in the environment makino et al 2003 the major virulence factor of v p is tdh that is a pore forming toxin that contributes to the invasiveness of the bacterium in humans and causes gastrointestinal symptoms letchumanan et al 2014 the first reported v p outbreak occurred in 1950 in japan and led to 272 illnesses with 20 deaths due to the consumption of raw seafood fujino et al 1953 the first confirmed v p outbreak in the united states u s happened in 1971 in maryland due to contaminated shellfish molenda et al 1972 since then v p has been recognized as a common cause of seafood related bacterial infections globally posing serious risks to the public health and the shellfish industry turner et al 2013 the estimated annual public health cost of v p infection in the u s is 1 5million due to direct exposure to v p and more than 21 million due to seafood born infections ralston et al 2011 given the growing rate of seafood production and consummation it is important to manage the v p infection risks by identifying potential hotspots of v p occurrence using predictive models therefore forecasting tools are needed to manage and prevent seafood born outbreaks extensive research efforts have been made in identifying environmental predictors and modeling and predicting v p abundance in coastal waters and oysters in terms of environmental predictors a number of environmental factors have been linked to the presence of v p including sea surface temperature sst salinity ph chlorophyll a and turbidity davis et al 2017 fernandez piquer et al 2011 urquhart et al 2016 williams et al 2017 for instance seasonal changes in the level of v p are generally attributed to seasonal variations in sst in fact sst is a critical factor to the ecology of v p and the incidence of human infection johnson 2015 when sst is lower than 13 c v p becomes dormant entering the viable but nonculturable vbnc state oliver 2005 v p may survive in sediment in cold seasons and emerge into the ambient water again when sst increases in warm seasons su and liu 2007 furthermore v p as a halophilic bacterium needs sodium chloride salinity for multiplication and survival yeung et al 2004 it is critical to include the most relevant environmental determinants of v p in predictive models for informing the presence of v p in oysters and harvesting waters in terms of modeling and predicting v p abundance urquhart 2015 utilized several different methods including generalized linear modeling glm generalized additive modeling gam and random forest models rf to predict the likelihood of occurrence as well as the abundance of v p in the chesapeake bay the best model was capable of predicting the abundance of v p with a mean absolute error of 5 8 cells 10 ml 1 another model developed by urquhart et al 2016 was able to estimate the likelihood of v p presence absence in oysters in new hampshire they used sst salinity and chlorophyll a as environmental parameters for predicting the likelihood of v p in oysters the results showed true positive rate tpr true negative rate tnr and matthews correlation coefficient mcc of 0 52 0 91 and 0 46 respectively by utilizing the datasets collected in the chesapeake bay over multiple seasons between 2007 and 2010 and dividing the datasets into summer and autumn subsets davis et al 2019 established the tobit regression models for predicting the abundance of v p in the chesapeake bay the tobit regression models used both the time indexed zero lag and the lagged environmental parameters including salinity dissolved oxygen sst and secchi disk depth semenza et al 2017 utilized sst and salinity to predict the odd ratio of vibrio infection in the baltic sea coast conditional logistic regression was utilized to establish the relationship between sst and the number of outbreaks from june 2006 to october 2014 it was found that the sst of 16 c was the threshold for vibrio infections with a relative risk of 1 14 also they found that the risk of infection will increase due to the impact of climate change in the future levy 2015 also confirmed that the baltic sea is the largest low salinity water where the projected climate change can create a favorable condition for the growth of v p in spite of the extensive efforts in modeling and predicting v p abundance there is currently no effective model with sufficient lead time available for forecasting the v p abundance in oysters the overall goal of this research is to develop such a forecasting model using environmental predictors to that end the specific objectives include the selection of model input variables the determination of the most appropriate modeling method and finally the assessment of uncertainty involved in model predictions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area fig 1 shows the six oyster harvesting areas in new hampshire and north carolina the united states u s two oyster harvesting areas oyster river and nannie island are located in new hampshire coast in the northeast of the u s the other four areas including south river north river hoop pole creek and harlowe creek are in north carolina estuaries from the perspective of environmental conditions the main difference between the new hampshire areas and the north carolina areas is temperature as they are located in different latitude zones based on the us climate data www usclimatedata com the annual average air temperatures in new hampshire and north carolina are 7 94 and 15 44 c respectively the second major difference is the annual precipitation that may affect salinity according to the us climate data the annual precipitation depths in new hampshire and north carolina are 2583 and 1159 mm respectively 2 2 data collection and processing data used in this study were collected from different sources and then combined specifically the data on v p concentration were obtained from urquhart et al 2016 who collected oyster samples from 2007 to 2013 in the two oyster harvesting areas in new hampshire and williams et al 2017 who collected samples from 2013 to 2015 in the four oyster harvesting areas along the north carolina coast the supplementary data in urquhart et al 2016 also consisted of environmental data for sea surface temperature sst salinity ph chlorophyll a and turbidity in addition to v p concentration data the supplementary data in williams et al 2017 also included the data for sst and salinity in addition to v p concentration data the required data for other environmental parameters including ph chlorophyll a and turbidity in north carolina and the data for the antecedent conditions of the environmental predictors including hourly time series sst and salinity were collected from online data sources for the period of 2007 2015 specifically data for sst were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration tides and currents noaa tides currents stations located in the bogue sound https tidesandcurrents noaa gov current chlorophyll a data for north carolina and the data describing antecedent conditions of salinity were downloaded from the noaa system wide monitoring program swmp https coast noaa gov swmp as a result the combined datasets include both the v p concentration data and the data for environmental predictors the combined datasets were collected over the eight year period of 2007 to 2015 from two distinct regions representing a wide range of environmental conditions after data cleaning a total of 227 data samples including 123 samples from new hampshire and 104 samples from north carolina were compiled in this research the compiled data were then normalized using feature scaling so that each parameter is scaled to a fixed range of 0 1 in order to improve the speed and efficiency of the machine learning algorithms used in this study daily sst and salinity data were also reorganized to form time lagged variables with the time lag of up to 30 days to describe the effects of antecedent environmental conditions on the v p abundance since antecedent environmental conditions were found to improve the prediction of the abundance of virus and v p chenar and deng 2018 davis et al 2019 2 3 input variable selection and model development random forest rf has demonstrated strong predictive performance in addressing a wide range of classification and regression analysis problems while providing measures of feature importance for each candidate predictor chenar and deng 2017 peters et al 2007 svetnik et al 2003 thus rf was adopted in this study not only to develop forecasting models but also to select relevant model input variables to minimize the negative effects of irrelevant and or redundant candidate inputs on the model training process rf integrates a large number of trees into a single procedure and uses the bootstrap method as a powerful idea for reducing the variance of a statistical learning method to produce many new populations from the original population by resampling data james et al 2013 with the combination of the idea of bagging peters et al 2007 and random feature selection shih and tsai 2004 rf grows an unpruned classification or regression trees and then predicts new data by cumulating the predictions of the trees svetnik et al 2003 the number of trees and predictors used to identify the split at each node are key principals of the rf method the gini variable importance or gini impurity was applied in this study to calculate the importance of each feature shih and tsai 2004 strobl et al 2007 the gini impurity is a measure for each tree to choose the best random variable for each node the gini impurity decreases following each split of a tree the rf method accumulates all the gini impurity decreases and divides them by the number of trees 500 in this study to find the average of gini impurity for each predictor the average is used to rank the importance of relevant environmental parameters associated with v p abundance minimize the number of explanatory variables and then select the most significant input variables it should be pointed out that the scale of the gini variable importance is unitless and irrelevant and only the relative value indicates the relative importance of a variable and shows which variable plays a more important role in predicting the v p abundance the implementation of the methods involves the following five major steps 1 to identify the most critical environmental parameters controlling v p abundance in oysters 2 to select the most significant time lags for each environmental parameter identified in the first step 3 to develop an rf based v p abundance forecasting model using the independent environmental parameters and their time lagged variables identified in the previous two steps as the model input variables 4 to evaluate the model performance using statistical measures 5 to assess the uncertainty involved in model predictions using the bootstrap method rf was utilized to rank the importance of environmental parameters including sst salinity chlorophyll a turbidity and ph the potential time lagged variables of each environmental parameter with the time lag of 1 30 days were identified in step 2 then the top ranked time lagged variables with the highest gini index and continuous daily data were selected as significant model input variables to avoid over training and further test the reliability of the rf based models the datasets were divided into two groups including a training group and an independent validation group the training group consisted of 60 of the total datasets utilized in the development of the rf models the remaining 40 of the total datasets were used as independent datasets for validation of the rf model performance the independent datasets were randomly selected with 50 of the data from the new hampshire datasets and the other 50 from the north carolina datasets the number of trees to grow is 500 ntree as the value was generally used in the literature as a default value for random forest liaw et al 2002 genuer et al 2010 the number of variables mtry randomly sampled as candidate predictors at each split is the number of predictors 3 and the minimum node size is five friedman et all 2017 the mtry 5 was chosen in this study for the rf forecasting models the random forest package within the rstudio environment version 1 1 456 was used for the rf analysis 2 4 metrics for model performance evaluation the performance of the rf based forecasting models was evaluated using two types of metrics including the goodness of fit and the predictive performance the goodness of fit metrics used in this study include the pearson s correlation coefficient and mean square error mse measuring the extent to which model predictions fit observed data the predictive performance metrics used in this study include the receiver operator characteristic roc curve true positive rate tpr true negative rate tnr accuracy acc and error rate er tpr tnr acc and er are defined in the following equations matthews 1975 1 t p r t p t p f n 2 t n r t n t n f p 3 a c c t p t n t p t n f p f n 4 e r f p f n t p t n f p f n where tp the number of samples that are predicted correctly by a model as positive presence tn the number of samples that are predicted correctly by a model as negative absence fp the number of samples that are mispredicted by a model as positive fn the number of samples that are mispredicted by a model as negative the roc curve illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier model like rf based models fawcett 2006 the roc curve is created by plotting tpr against fpr so that an area of 1 0 represents perfect predictive performance while an area of 0 5 shows poor predictive performance it should be pointed out that the predictive performance metrics were calculated using 30 mpn gram as the threshold level of v p outbreak or oyster safety according to the national shellfish sanitation program nssp report nssp 2017 it means that oysters are safe to eat if the v p concentration in oysters is lower than 30 mpn gram based on this threshold level the abundance of v p in oysters is transformed into the binary presence absence classification that is v p presence occurs if the v p cell count is higher than 30 mpn gram otherwise v p absence is reported 2 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis ua was performed to evaluate the uncertainty involved in model predictions due to potential errors in model input parameters various techniques have been proposed in the literature to determine model uncertainty including bayesian methods beven and binley 1992 analytical and approximation methods melching 1992 tung 1996 methods based on the analysis of model errors montanari and brath 2004 fuzzy set theory based methods maskey 2004 and simulation and sampling based methods kuczera and parent 1998 the uncertainty analysis of a random forest model was conducted based on sampling methods bootstrapping is a statistical technique that is commonly used to estimate the uncertainty involved in a statistic or model prediction hastie et al 2009 the method relies on random sampling with replacement as an approximation of what would happen if the population is resampled let z z1 z2 zn denote the original data set n 136 91 and 227 for training testing and all data respectively and z 1 to z b are the random samples with the size of n of the original data set with replacement b 1000 and g z 1 z 2 z b are the predictions computed from the data z 1 t o z b the bootstrap sampling procedure used in this study is illustrated in fig 2 and summarized as follows 1 to randomly draw datasets b 1000 with replacement from samples n 136 227 60 for the model training data n 91 227 40 for the model test data and n 227 for all data 2 to refit the model g z 1 z 2 z b to each of the bootstrap datasets 3 to estimate the root mean squared error rmse of each observation and the predictions over the b 1000 replications 4 to calculate the 95 confidence interval ci in this study 1000 datasets were randomly drawn with replacement from the training data test data and all data producing 1000 bootstrap datasets then random forest models were refitted to each of the bootstrap datasets and the behavior of the fits over the 1000 replications was examined using rmse 3 results the results achieved in this study are shown using figures and tables with details described in the sections below 3 1 independent input variables fig 3 shows the relative importance of the five environmental variables associated with the v p level in oysters based on the gini importance index the figure clearly indicates that sst is by far the most important model input variable or environmental predictor affecting the v p level in oysters salinity and ph appear to be equally important to the v p abundance forecasting chlorophyll a is less important than the first three variables but it is obviously more important than turbidity that is the least important variable overall sst salinity and ph are the top three environmental predictors for the v p level in oysters due to the lack of sufficient daily data for ph chlorophyll a and turbidity particularly for the extended lag time up to 30 days sst and salinity are the only two variables finally selected as the independent variables for the forecasting models 3 2 time lags for selected independent variables rf ranked time lags up to 30 days for each selected independent variable sst and salinity based on their scores of gini importance to v p abundance fig 4 shows the relative importance of different time lags of sst and salinity variables calculated using the gini index where the sst or salinity for each day is treated as a separate variable it is apparent from fig 4 a that the sst variable with the time lag of 2 days is the most important predictor for v p abundance followed by the time lags of 3 1 4 5 and 8 days similarly the most important salinity variable is the salinity with the time lag of 3 days fig 4 b followed by the time lags of 11 7 4 1 and 5 days since the goal of this study was to develop forecasting models with the differing lead times of one day two days three days and four days to ensure both the necessary forecasting accuracy and the sufficient lead time for emergency preparedness and interventions the top three time lags were selected for each independent variable leading to six input variables for each rf model the selected input variables for the four forecasting models are summarized in table 1 3 3 forecasting models and performance four best trained and tested models called rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day were selected as the forecasting models with different lead times for the v p abundance it means that v p abundance in oysters could be forecasted one to four days in advance with rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models respectively figs 5 shows how well each model performs with the training datasets by comparing the log transformed v p concentrations forecasted with rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models and observed from june 2007 to september 2015 the model performance metrics for fig 5 are summarized in table 2 in terms of the goodness of fit the correlation coefficients of the model forecasts with the training datasets are 0 92 0 92 0 92 and 0 91 for rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models respectively all the four models have the same mean square error mse of 0 24 with the training datasets the quantitative metrics demonstrate excellent performance of the forecasting models with the training datasets the models were also tested with the independent datasets that were not used in the model training process to avoid overtraining of the models figs 6 shows the performance of individual forecasting models with the independent testing datasets by comparing the log transformed v p concentrations forecasted with rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models and observed from june 2007 to october 2015 overall the model predictions follow the seasonal variations in the observed v p abundance showing the efficacy of the forecasting models the quantitative performance of each model with the independent testing datasets is also summarized in table 2 the correlation coefficient and mse are 0 74 and 0 58 for the rf 1day model 0 73 and 0 60 for the rf 2day model 0 70 and 0 64 for the rf 3day model 0 68 and 0 68 for the rf 4day model respectively the independent validation results clearly indicate that the model performance deteriorates with increasing lead time in terms of overall performance with all datasets including both the training and testing datasets the correlation coefficients and the mse of model forecasts are 0 86 and 0 37 for the rf 1day model 0 85 and 0 40 for the rf 2day model 0 84 and 0 40 for the rf 3day model 0 83 and 0 41 for the rf 4day model respectively the predictive performance of the forecasting models is also illustrated quantitatively in table 3 with tpr tnr acc and er values and graphically in fig 7 with the roc curve the areas under the roc curve for rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day model forecasts are 0 97 0 96 0 95 and 0 94 respectively indicating the very good performance of the forecasting models the 95 confidence band representing the uncertainty involved in the v p abundance predictions with a model using the 8 years of available datasets is plotted in fig 8 and compared with observed data for rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models respectively the width of each shaded band describes the uncertainty from re running a model with the 1000 resampled datasets or replications table 4 shows the rmses of the model predictions with different datasets the overall rmses of the model predictions are 0 66 0 66 0 68 and 0 69 for rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models respectively the table also indicates that the model predictions contain higher rmses and thereby higher uncertainty with the independent testing data furthermore the rmse and thereby the uncertainty generally increase with increasing lead time the color bands in fig 8 show the 95 confidence intervals of model predictions for individual observation samples the black dash line in fig 8 indicates the average of g z 1 z 2 z b 4 discussion despite advances in medicine and public health v p infections to humans are expected to increase in the future due to global warming and growing population and demand for seafood baker austin et al 2018 semenza et al 2017 effective and efficient forecasting models can help identify potential v p infection risks and design effective intervention strategies to mitigate the infection risks to the public health and shellfish industry a major contribution of this study is the identification of the important environmental predictors fig 3 and particularly the time lags of the predictors figs 4 confirming that the v p abundance is controlled by antecedent environmental conditions rather than the current or real time conditions that are the theoretical basis of many existing models semenza et al 2017 and guidelines nssp 2017 more importantly the time lagged environmental predictors are subtly integrated into a random forest forecasting system within the r statistical computing environment the random forest forecasting system consists of four forecasting models with the differing lead times of 1 day 2 days 3 days and 4 days the forecasting system provides both the sufficient lead time particularly 4 day for emergency preparedness and intervention and the high predictive performance particularly the 1 day model as evidenced by the highest predictive performance of the 1 day model and the increasing predictive performance of models with decreasing lead time shown in tables 2 and 3 the implication of the increasing predictive performance of models with decreasing lead time is that the rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models could be employed by infectious disease epidemiology programs and oyster safety monitoring programs for emergency preparedness due to their relatively long lead time while the rf 1day model could be used primarily for management interventions due to its high predictive performance specifically oyster safety monitoring programs should be informed and prepared for field sampling if the rf 4day model forecasts the potential presence of v p in oysters oyster farmers should be informed of potential v p outbreak in oysters if rf 2day and rf 3day models forecast the potential presence of v p in oysters oyster harvesting should be suspended and field sampling and laboratory analysis of samples should be conducted on the forecasted outbreak day if rf 1day model forecasts the potential presence of v p in oysters implicated oyster harvest areas are generally closed for an extended time typically 21 days nssp 2017 if the laboratory analysis result confirms the presence of v p in oysters by combining the model forecasts and management interventions such as field sampling laboratory analysis oyster harvesting suspension and oyster area closure the potential risk of v p infections to humans and to the seafood industry could be mitigated it should be pointed out that the selection of time lagged temperature and salinity as the model input variables is consistent with the oyster population dynamics hofmann et al 1994 wang et al 2008 that affects oyster filtration rate and thereby the concentration of v p abundance in oysters while all the performance metrics indicate that the forecasting models with two independent variables temperature and salinity performed reasonably well the model performance might be further improved by incorporating additional environmental predictors particularly ph and chlorophyll a identified in fig 3 and additional time lags into the models in future modeling efforts if continuous daily observations are available for the additional predictors overall the first five days day 1 day 5 are the most important time lags and the first eleven days are important to modeling and forecasting as shown in fig 4 the importance of the time lag to the v p abundance generally decreases with the increasing number of lagged days the high performance of the rf models confirms the previous research findings that the rf based models provide stable predictions and they are computationally efficient and straightforward to train cracknell et al 2014 wiesmeier et al 2011 it is also important to note that while the application of the rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models to other regions may require additional validation and calibration particularly the time lags with local data the modeling methods presented in this paper are generally applicable another important contribution of this paper is the uncertainty analysis that is rarely conducted for v p models even though it is important to address the uncertainty of model predictions hengl et al 2017 nussbaum et al 2017 westerberg and mcmillan 2015 in fact the uncertainty is always involved in model predictions no matter how accurate a model might be it is therefore essential to quantify the uncertainty so that the potential risk of v p outbreak due to the uncertainty in model predictions could be taken into account and the v p infection risk to the public and seafood industry could be minimized the bootstrapping results of uncertainty analysis as shown in fig 8 and table 4 indicate that the uncertainty involved in model predictions increases with the model lead time ranging from 1 day to 4 days while the 4 day or 3 day lead time is beneficial to the emergency preparedness the predictions of rf 3day and rf 4day models overall contain higher uncertainty according to table 4 justifying the need for rf 1day and rf 2day models for management interventions consequently the random forest forecasting system of four models provides an effective and efficient forecasting tool for the infection risk management of v p abundance in oysters a major limitation to the application of the forecasting system is the requirement for the continuous at least 11 days daily data for the two environmental predictors 5 conclusions a random forest forecasting system consisting of four models with differing lead times is created within the r statistical computing environment for predicting the v p abundance in oysters based on the findings from the modeling system development and predictions the following conclusions can be drawn 1 v p abundance in oysters is controlled by antecedent environmental conditions 1 11 days before the antecedent environmental conditions can be described adequately using time lagged sst and salinity 2 the v p abundance in oysters can be forecasted 1 4 days in advance using rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models with reasonable performance indicating the efficacy of the rf based forecasting models the accuracy of model forecasts increases with decreasing lead time therefore it is recommended that the rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models be employed primarily for emergency preparedness due to their relatively long lead time while the rf 1day model be used primarily for management interventions due to its relatively high predictive performance 3 the random forest forecasting system enables public health agencies and oyster harvesters to focus more on preventing v p infections rather than relying on reacting to problems after they have occurred greatly reducing the risk of v p infection to human health and the risk of economic loss to the seafood industry 4 while the random forest forecasting system was created for the study regions the forecasting models and particularly the modeling methods may generally be applicable to other regions as long as proper model

17354,vibrio parahaemolyticus v p is an epidemiologically significant pathogen that thrives in coastal waters where oysters are harvested posing high risks to human health and shellfish industry and requiring effective forecasting models for emergency preparedness and interventions this study sought to develop forecasting models with differing lead times which are able to predict the level of v p in oysters in advance to mitigate the health risk to the general public and the economic loss to the shellfish industry the random forest method along with 227 sampling datasets from two different geographic locations were utilized to 1 identify the most critical environmental predictors controlling the level of v p in oysters 2 select the most important time lags for the environmental predictors as model input variables and 3 develop four forecasting models rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day with the lead time of one to four days the uncertainty involved in model predictions was quantified using the bootstrapping method results showed that v p abundance in oysters is controlled by antecedent environmental conditions 1 11 days before the antecedent environmental conditions can be described using time lagged sea surface temperature sst and salinity the v p abundance can well be forecasted 1 4 days in advance using the four models the performance of the models decreases with increasing lead time the rf 3day and rf 4day models can be employed primarily for emergency preparedness due to their relatively long lead time while the rf 1day and rf 2day models can be used primarily for management interventions due to their relatively high predictive performance keywords vibrio parahaemolyticus random forest forecasting models 1 introduction vibrio parahaemolyticus v p is a gram negative and halophilic bacterium that thrives in coastal waters davis et al 2017 zimmerman et al 2007 where oysters are commonly harvested v p is also an epidemiologically significant pathogen that is the leading cause of seafood borne illnesses associated with the consumption of raw seafood especially shellfish harvested from warm water estuaries daniels et al 2000 levy 2018 oysters are natural filter feeders facilitating the concentration of v p in oyster tissues wang and deng 2016 oliver 2015 human exposure to v p may cause gastroenteritis wound infections and septicemia depending on virulent strains and exposure routes v p has several virulence factors including adhesins thermostable direct hemolysin tdh and tdh related hemolysin trh in addition to two type iii secretion systems to survive in the environment makino et al 2003 the major virulence factor of v p is tdh that is a pore forming toxin that contributes to the invasiveness of the bacterium in humans and causes gastrointestinal symptoms letchumanan et al 2014 the first reported v p outbreak occurred in 1950 in japan and led to 272 illnesses with 20 deaths due to the consumption of raw seafood fujino et al 1953 the first confirmed v p outbreak in the united states u s happened in 1971 in maryland due to contaminated shellfish molenda et al 1972 since then v p has been recognized as a common cause of seafood related bacterial infections globally posing serious risks to the public health and the shellfish industry turner et al 2013 the estimated annual public health cost of v p infection in the u s is 1 5million due to direct exposure to v p and more than 21 million due to seafood born infections ralston et al 2011 given the growing rate of seafood production and consummation it is important to manage the v p infection risks by identifying potential hotspots of v p occurrence using predictive models therefore forecasting tools are needed to manage and prevent seafood born outbreaks extensive research efforts have been made in identifying environmental predictors and modeling and predicting v p abundance in coastal waters and oysters in terms of environmental predictors a number of environmental factors have been linked to the presence of v p including sea surface temperature sst salinity ph chlorophyll a and turbidity davis et al 2017 fernandez piquer et al 2011 urquhart et al 2016 williams et al 2017 for instance seasonal changes in the level of v p are generally attributed to seasonal variations in sst in fact sst is a critical factor to the ecology of v p and the incidence of human infection johnson 2015 when sst is lower than 13 c v p becomes dormant entering the viable but nonculturable vbnc state oliver 2005 v p may survive in sediment in cold seasons and emerge into the ambient water again when sst increases in warm seasons su and liu 2007 furthermore v p as a halophilic bacterium needs sodium chloride salinity for multiplication and survival yeung et al 2004 it is critical to include the most relevant environmental determinants of v p in predictive models for informing the presence of v p in oysters and harvesting waters in terms of modeling and predicting v p abundance urquhart 2015 utilized several different methods including generalized linear modeling glm generalized additive modeling gam and random forest models rf to predict the likelihood of occurrence as well as the abundance of v p in the chesapeake bay the best model was capable of predicting the abundance of v p with a mean absolute error of 5 8 cells 10 ml 1 another model developed by urquhart et al 2016 was able to estimate the likelihood of v p presence absence in oysters in new hampshire they used sst salinity and chlorophyll a as environmental parameters for predicting the likelihood of v p in oysters the results showed true positive rate tpr true negative rate tnr and matthews correlation coefficient mcc of 0 52 0 91 and 0 46 respectively by utilizing the datasets collected in the chesapeake bay over multiple seasons between 2007 and 2010 and dividing the datasets into summer and autumn subsets davis et al 2019 established the tobit regression models for predicting the abundance of v p in the chesapeake bay the tobit regression models used both the time indexed zero lag and the lagged environmental parameters including salinity dissolved oxygen sst and secchi disk depth semenza et al 2017 utilized sst and salinity to predict the odd ratio of vibrio infection in the baltic sea coast conditional logistic regression was utilized to establish the relationship between sst and the number of outbreaks from june 2006 to october 2014 it was found that the sst of 16 c was the threshold for vibrio infections with a relative risk of 1 14 also they found that the risk of infection will increase due to the impact of climate change in the future levy 2015 also confirmed that the baltic sea is the largest low salinity water where the projected climate change can create a favorable condition for the growth of v p in spite of the extensive efforts in modeling and predicting v p abundance there is currently no effective model with sufficient lead time available for forecasting the v p abundance in oysters the overall goal of this research is to develop such a forecasting model using environmental predictors to that end the specific objectives include the selection of model input variables the determination of the most appropriate modeling method and finally the assessment of uncertainty involved in model predictions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area fig 1 shows the six oyster harvesting areas in new hampshire and north carolina the united states u s two oyster harvesting areas oyster river and nannie island are located in new hampshire coast in the northeast of the u s the other four areas including south river north river hoop pole creek and harlowe creek are in north carolina estuaries from the perspective of environmental conditions the main difference between the new hampshire areas and the north carolina areas is temperature as they are located in different latitude zones based on the us climate data www usclimatedata com the annual average air temperatures in new hampshire and north carolina are 7 94 and 15 44 c respectively the second major difference is the annual precipitation that may affect salinity according to the us climate data the annual precipitation depths in new hampshire and north carolina are 2583 and 1159 mm respectively 2 2 data collection and processing data used in this study were collected from different sources and then combined specifically the data on v p concentration were obtained from urquhart et al 2016 who collected oyster samples from 2007 to 2013 in the two oyster harvesting areas in new hampshire and williams et al 2017 who collected samples from 2013 to 2015 in the four oyster harvesting areas along the north carolina coast the supplementary data in urquhart et al 2016 also consisted of environmental data for sea surface temperature sst salinity ph chlorophyll a and turbidity in addition to v p concentration data the supplementary data in williams et al 2017 also included the data for sst and salinity in addition to v p concentration data the required data for other environmental parameters including ph chlorophyll a and turbidity in north carolina and the data for the antecedent conditions of the environmental predictors including hourly time series sst and salinity were collected from online data sources for the period of 2007 2015 specifically data for sst were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration tides and currents noaa tides currents stations located in the bogue sound https tidesandcurrents noaa gov current chlorophyll a data for north carolina and the data describing antecedent conditions of salinity were downloaded from the noaa system wide monitoring program swmp https coast noaa gov swmp as a result the combined datasets include both the v p concentration data and the data for environmental predictors the combined datasets were collected over the eight year period of 2007 to 2015 from two distinct regions representing a wide range of environmental conditions after data cleaning a total of 227 data samples including 123 samples from new hampshire and 104 samples from north carolina were compiled in this research the compiled data were then normalized using feature scaling so that each parameter is scaled to a fixed range of 0 1 in order to improve the speed and efficiency of the machine learning algorithms used in this study daily sst and salinity data were also reorganized to form time lagged variables with the time lag of up to 30 days to describe the effects of antecedent environmental conditions on the v p abundance since antecedent environmental conditions were found to improve the prediction of the abundance of virus and v p chenar and deng 2018 davis et al 2019 2 3 input variable selection and model development random forest rf has demonstrated strong predictive performance in addressing a wide range of classification and regression analysis problems while providing measures of feature importance for each candidate predictor chenar and deng 2017 peters et al 2007 svetnik et al 2003 thus rf was adopted in this study not only to develop forecasting models but also to select relevant model input variables to minimize the negative effects of irrelevant and or redundant candidate inputs on the model training process rf integrates a large number of trees into a single procedure and uses the bootstrap method as a powerful idea for reducing the variance of a statistical learning method to produce many new populations from the original population by resampling data james et al 2013 with the combination of the idea of bagging peters et al 2007 and random feature selection shih and tsai 2004 rf grows an unpruned classification or regression trees and then predicts new data by cumulating the predictions of the trees svetnik et al 2003 the number of trees and predictors used to identify the split at each node are key principals of the rf method the gini variable importance or gini impurity was applied in this study to calculate the importance of each feature shih and tsai 2004 strobl et al 2007 the gini impurity is a measure for each tree to choose the best random variable for each node the gini impurity decreases following each split of a tree the rf method accumulates all the gini impurity decreases and divides them by the number of trees 500 in this study to find the average of gini impurity for each predictor the average is used to rank the importance of relevant environmental parameters associated with v p abundance minimize the number of explanatory variables and then select the most significant input variables it should be pointed out that the scale of the gini variable importance is unitless and irrelevant and only the relative value indicates the relative importance of a variable and shows which variable plays a more important role in predicting the v p abundance the implementation of the methods involves the following five major steps 1 to identify the most critical environmental parameters controlling v p abundance in oysters 2 to select the most significant time lags for each environmental parameter identified in the first step 3 to develop an rf based v p abundance forecasting model using the independent environmental parameters and their time lagged variables identified in the previous two steps as the model input variables 4 to evaluate the model performance using statistical measures 5 to assess the uncertainty involved in model predictions using the bootstrap method rf was utilized to rank the importance of environmental parameters including sst salinity chlorophyll a turbidity and ph the potential time lagged variables of each environmental parameter with the time lag of 1 30 days were identified in step 2 then the top ranked time lagged variables with the highest gini index and continuous daily data were selected as significant model input variables to avoid over training and further test the reliability of the rf based models the datasets were divided into two groups including a training group and an independent validation group the training group consisted of 60 of the total datasets utilized in the development of the rf models the remaining 40 of the total datasets were used as independent datasets for validation of the rf model performance the independent datasets were randomly selected with 50 of the data from the new hampshire datasets and the other 50 from the north carolina datasets the number of trees to grow is 500 ntree as the value was generally used in the literature as a default value for random forest liaw et al 2002 genuer et al 2010 the number of variables mtry randomly sampled as candidate predictors at each split is the number of predictors 3 and the minimum node size is five friedman et all 2017 the mtry 5 was chosen in this study for the rf forecasting models the random forest package within the rstudio environment version 1 1 456 was used for the rf analysis 2 4 metrics for model performance evaluation the performance of the rf based forecasting models was evaluated using two types of metrics including the goodness of fit and the predictive performance the goodness of fit metrics used in this study include the pearson s correlation coefficient and mean square error mse measuring the extent to which model predictions fit observed data the predictive performance metrics used in this study include the receiver operator characteristic roc curve true positive rate tpr true negative rate tnr accuracy acc and error rate er tpr tnr acc and er are defined in the following equations matthews 1975 1 t p r t p t p f n 2 t n

roc curve illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier model like rf based models fawcett 2006 the roc curve is created by plotting tpr against fpr so that an area of 1 0 represents perfect predictive performance while an area of 0 5 shows poor predictive performance it should be pointed out that the predictive performance metrics were calculated using 30 mpn gram as the threshold level of v p outbreak or oyster safety according to the national shellfish sanitation program nssp report nssp 2017 it means that oysters are safe to eat if the v p concentration in oysters is lower than 30 mpn gram based on this threshold level the abundance of v p in oysters is transformed into the binary presence absence classification that is v p presence occurs if the v p cell count is higher than 30 mpn gram otherwise v p absence is reported 2 5 uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis ua was performed to evaluate the uncertainty involved in model predictions due to potential errors in model input parameters various techniques have been proposed in the literature to determine model uncertainty including bayesian methods beven and binley 1992 analytical and approximation methods melching 1992 tung 1996 methods based on the analysis of model errors montanari and brath 2004 fuzzy set theory based methods maskey 2004 and simulation and sampling based methods kuczera and parent 1998 the uncertainty analysis of a random forest model was conducted based on sampling methods bootstrapping is a statistical technique that is commonly used to estimate the uncertainty involved in a statistic or model prediction hastie et al 2009 the method relies on random sampling with replacement as an approximation of what would happen if the population is resampled let z z1 z2 zn denote the original data set n 136 91 and 227 for training testing and all data respectively and z 1 to z b are the random samples with the size of n of the original data set with replacement b 1000 and g z 1 z 2 z b are the predictions computed from the data z 1 t o z b the bootstrap sampling procedure used in this study is illustrated in fig 2 and summarized as follows 1 to randomly draw datasets b 1000 with replacement from samples n 136 227 60 for the model training data n 91 227 40 for the model test data and n 227 for all data 2 to refit the model g z 1 z 2 z b to each of the bootstrap datasets 3 to estimate the root mean squared error rmse of each observation and the predictions over the b 1000 replications 4 to calculate the 95 confidence interval ci in this study 1000 datasets were randomly drawn with replacement from the training data test data and all data producing 1000 bootstrap datasets then random forest models were refitted to each of the bootstrap datasets and the behavior of the fits over the 1000 replications was examined using rmse 3 results the results achieved in this study are shown using figures and tables with details described in the sections below 3 1 independent input variables fig 3 shows the relative importance of the five environmental variables associated with the v p level in oysters based on the gini importance index the figure clearly indicates that sst is by far the most important model input variable or environmental predictor affecting the v p level in oysters salinity and ph appear to be equally important to the v p abundance forecasting chlorophyll a is less important than the first three variables but it is obviously more important than turbidity that is the least important variable overall sst salinity and ph are the top three environmental predictors for the v p level in oysters due to the lack of sufficient daily data for ph chlorophyll a and turbidity particularly for the extended lag time up to 30 days sst and salinity are the only two variables finally selected as the independent variables for the forecasting models 3 2 time lags for selected independent variables rf ranked time lags up to 30 days for each selected independent variable sst and salinity based on their scores of gini importance to v p abundance fig 4 shows the relative importance of different time lags of sst and salinity variables calculated using the gini index where the sst or salinity for each day is treated as a separate variable it is apparent from fig 4 a that the sst variable with the time lag of 2 days is the most important predictor for v p abundance followed by the time lags of 3 1 4 5 and 8 days similarly the most important salinity variable is the salinity with the time lag of 3 days fig 4 b followed by the time lags of 11 7 4 1 and 5 days since the goal of this study was to develop forecasting models with the differing lead times of one day two days three days and four days to ensure both the necessary forecasting accuracy and the sufficient lead time for emergency preparedness and interventions the top three time lags were selected for each independent variable leading to six input variables for each rf model the selected input variables for the four forecasting models are summarized in table 1 3 3 forecasting models and performance four best trained and tested models called rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day were selected as the forecasting models with different lead times for the v p abundance it means that v p abundance in oysters could be forecasted one to four days in advance with rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models respectively figs 5 shows how well each model performs with the training datasets by comparing the log transformed v p concentrations forecasted with rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models and observed from june 2007 to september 2015 the model performance metrics for fig 5 are summarized in table 2 in terms of the goodness of fit the correlation coefficients of the model forecasts with the training datasets are 0 92 0 92 0 92 and 0 91 for rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models respectively all the four models have the same mean square error mse of 0 24 with the training datasets the quantitative metrics demonstrate excellent performance of the forecasting models with the training datasets the models were also tested with the independent datasets that were not used in the model training process to avoid overtraining of the models figs 6 shows the performance of individual forecasting models with the independent testing datasets by comparing the log transformed v p concentrations forecasted with rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models and observed from june 2007 to october 2015 overall the model predictions follow the seasonal variations in the observed v p abundance showing the efficacy of the forecasting models the quantitative performance of each model with the independent testing datasets is also summarized in table 2 the correlation coefficient and mse are 0 74 and 0 58 for the rf 1day model 0 73 and 0 60 for the rf 2day model 0 70 and 0 64 for the rf 3day model 0 68 and 0 68 for the rf 4day model respectively the independent validation results clearly indicate that the model performance deteriorates with increasing lead time in terms of overall performance with all datasets including both the training and testing datasets the correlation coefficients and the mse of model forecasts are 0 86 and 0 37 for the rf 1day model 0 85 and 0 40 for the rf 2day model 0 84 and 0 40 for the rf 3day model 0 83 and 0 41 for the rf 4day model respectively the predictive performance of the forecasting models is also illustrated quantitatively in table 3 with tpr tnr acc and er values and graphically in fig 7 with the roc curve the areas under the roc curve for rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day model forecasts are 0 97 0 96 0 95 and 0 94 respectively indicating the very good performance of the forecasting models the 95 confidence band representing the uncertainty involved in the v p abundance predictions with a model using the 8 years of available datasets is plotted in fig 8 and compared with observed data for rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models respectively the width of each shaded band describes the uncertainty from re running a model with the 1000 resampled datasets or replications table 4 shows the rmses of the model predictions with different datasets the overall rmses of the model predictions are 0 66 0 66 0 68 and 0 69 for rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models respectively the table also indicates that the model predictions contain higher rmses and thereby higher uncertainty with the independent testing data furthermore the rmse and thereby the uncertainty generally increase with increasing lead time the color bands in fig 8 show the 95 confidence intervals of model predictions for individual observation samples the black dash line in fig 8 indicates the average of g z 1 z 2 z b 4 discussion despite advances in medicine and public health v p infections to humans are expected to increase in the future due to global warming and growing population and demand for seafood baker austin et al 2018 semenza et al 2017 effective and efficient forecasting models can help identify potential v p infection risks and design effective intervention strategies to mitigate the infection risks to the public health and shellfish industry a major contribution of this study is the identification of the important environmental predictors fig 3 and particularly the time lags of the predictors figs 4 confirming that the v p abundance is controlled by antecedent environmental conditions rather than the current or real time conditions that are the theoretical basis of many existing models semenza et al 2017 and guidelines nssp 2017 more importantly the time lagged environmental predictors are subtly integrated into a random forest forecasting system within the r statistical computing environment the random forest forecasting system consists of four forecasting models with the differing lead times of 1 day 2 days 3 days and 4 days the forecasting system provides both the sufficient lead time particularly 4 day for emergency preparedness and intervention and the high predictive performance particularly the 1 day model as evidenced by the highest predictive performance of the 1 day model and the increasing predictive performance of models with decreasing lead time shown in tables 2 and 3 the implication of the increasing predictive performance of models with decreasing lead time is that the rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models could be employed by infectious disease epidemiology programs and oyster safety monitoring programs for emergency preparedness due to their relatively long lead time while the rf 1day model could be used primarily for management interventions due to its high predictive performance specifically oyster safety monitoring programs should be informed and prepared for field sampling if the rf 4day model forecasts the potential presence of v p in oysters oyster farmers should be informed of potential v p outbreak in oysters if rf 2day and rf 3day models forecast the potential presence of v p in oysters oyster harvesting should be suspended and field sampling and laboratory analysis of samples should be conducted on the forecasted outbreak day if rf 1day model forecasts the potential presence of v p in oysters implicated oyster harvest areas are generally closed for an extended time typically 21 days nssp 2017 if the laboratory analysis result confirms the presence of v p in oysters by combining the model forecasts and management interventions such as field sampling laboratory analysis oyster harvesting suspension and oyster area closure the potential risk of v p infections to humans and to the seafood industry could be mitigated it should be pointed out that the selection of time lagged temperature and salinity as the model input variables is consistent with the oyster population dynamics hofmann et al 1994 wang et al 2008 that affects oyster filtration rate and thereby the concentration of v p abundance in oysters while all the performance metrics indicate that the forecasting models with two independent variables temperature and salinity performed reasonably well the model performance might be further improved by incorporating additional environmental predictors particularly ph and chlorophyll a identified in fig 3 and additional time lags into the models in future modeling efforts if continuous daily observations are available for the additional predictors overall the first five days day 1 day 5 are the most important time lags and the first eleven days are important to modeling and forecasting as shown in fig 4 the importance of the time lag to the v p abundance generally decreases with the increasing number of lagged days the high performance of the rf models confirms the previous research findings that the rf based models provide stable predictions and they are computationally efficient and straightforward to train cracknell et al 2014 wiesmeier et al 2011 it is also important to note that while the application of the rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models to other regions may require additional validation and calibration particularly the time lags with local data the modeling methods presented in this paper are generally applicable another important contribution of this paper is the uncertainty analysis that is rarely conducted for v p models even though it is important to address the uncertainty of model predictions hengl et al 2017 nussbaum et al 2017 westerberg and mcmillan 2015 in fact the uncertainty is always involved in model predictions no matter how accurate a model might be it is therefore essential to quantify the uncertainty so that the potential risk of v p outbreak due to the uncertainty in model predictions could be taken into account and the v p infection risk to the public and seafood industry could be minimized the bootstrapping results of uncertainty analysis as shown in fig 8 and table 4 indicate that the uncertainty involved in model predictions increases with the model lead time ranging from 1 day to 4 days while the 4 day or 3 day lead time is beneficial to the emergency preparedness the predictions of rf 3day and rf 4day models overall contain higher uncertainty according to table 4 justifying the need for rf 1day and rf 2day models for management interventions consequently the random forest forecasting system of four models provides an effective and efficient forecasting tool for the infection risk management of v p abundance in oysters a major limitation to the application of the forecasting system is the requirement for the continuous at least 11 days daily data for the two environmental predictors 5 conclusions a random forest forecasting system consisting of four models with differing lead times is created within the r statistical computing environment for predicting the v p abundance in oysters based on the findings from the modeling system development and predictions the following conclusions can be drawn 1 v p abundance in oysters is controlled by antecedent environmental conditions 1 11 days before the antecedent environmental conditions can be described adequately using time lagged sst and salinity 2 the v p abundance in oysters can be forecasted 1 4 days in advance using rf 1day rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models with reasonable performance indicating the efficacy of the rf based forecasting models the accuracy of model forecasts increases with decreasing lead time therefore it is recommended that the rf 2day rf 3day and rf 4day models be employed primarily for emergency preparedness due to their relatively long lead time while the rf 1day model be used primarily for management interventions due to its relatively high predictive performance 3 the random forest forecasting system enables public health agencies and oyster harvesters to focus more on preventing v p infections rather than relying on reacting to problems after they have occurred greatly reducing the risk of v p infection to human health and the risk of economic loss to the seafood industry 4 while the random forest forecasting system was created for the study regions the forecasting models and particularly the modeling methods may generally be applicable to other regions as long as proper model validation and calibration especially the time lags are performed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
