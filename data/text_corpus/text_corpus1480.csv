7400,groundwater fed agriculture has caused water table declines and groundwater quality degradation in the north china plain based on sediment sampling in deep vadose zone with a maximum depth of 11 0 m groundwater recharge seepage velocity solute inventory and transport under four typical irrigated agricultural land use types winter wheat and summer maize wm pear orchards po outdoor vegetables ve and cotton co were investigated in this study the results reveal that there are many solutes stored in the vadose zone nitrate storage per unit depth in the vadose zone is highest under po 1703 kg ha followed by ve 970 kg ha wm 736 kg ha and co 727 kg ha however the amount of annual leached nitrate under the four land use types results in a different order ve 404 kg ha wm 108 kg ha po 23 kg ha co 13 kg ha the estimated average recharge rates are 180 mm yr for wm 27 mm yr for co 320 mm yr for ve and 49 mm yr for po the seepage velocity under ve 2 22 m yr exceeds the values under the other three land use types wm 0 85 m yr po 0 49 m yr co 0 09 m yr the highest seepage velocity under ve caused significant nitrate contamination in groundwater whereas the other two land use types wm and po had no direct influence on groundwater quality the results of this work could be used for groundwater resources management keywords agricultural land use types deep vadose zone groundwater recharge solute transport north china plain 1 introduction agricultural land use activities not only produce food for increasing human needs but also influence the quantity and quality of freshwater resources especially in areas with irrigated crop lands foley et al 2005 according to previous studies the irrigation sector accounts for 70 of the global water demand and the total groundwater used for irrigation is responsible for 43 of the global irrigation water demand which gives rise to groundwater overexploitation siebert et al 2010 wada et al 2012 wada et al 2013 in addition a large quantity of soluble salts in irrigated water as well as agricultural chemicals may be transported into the underlying aquifers which can profoundly affect groundwater quality böhlke 2002 scanlon et al 2010a russo et al 2014 therefore intensive agriculture has been widely reported as a cause of worldwide water table decline and leached agricultural chemicals into groundwater the vadose zone connecting the land surface and groundwater and acting as a buffer and filter zone in which the water flow and solute transport are attenuated and contaminants are absorbed degraded and transformed plays an important role in the quality and quantity of groundwater resources harter and hopmans 2004 nimmo 2005 in an area with a deep water table water percolates from the root zone to the deep vadose zone and the process results in deep drainage or potential groundwater recharge de vries and simmers 2002 if the influence of an impeding layer is absent the water will eventually reach the aquifer and becoming actual recharge meanwhile solutes and many other agricultural chemicals would be transported with soil water as a consequence groundwater may become contaminated scanlon et al 2010a nitrate pollution in groundwater caused by agricultural practice is a common problem across the globe diez et al 2000 böhlke 2002 kundu and mandal 2009 under improper irrigation lots of nitrate will be flushed out of root zone into deep vadose zone and the leached nitrate will ultimately move to aquifer without sufficient denitrification because of low available carbon source in deep vadose zone yuan et al 2017 therefore investigation of soil water movement and solute transport in the deep vadose zone under cropland could aid groundwater resources management based on deep vadose zone data which were obtained by continuous monitoring or campaign type sampling the potential groundwater recharge and solute leaching under different land use types have been extensively investigated in order to evaluate the dynamics of soil water and solute concentrations dahan et al 2009 invented a slanted monitoring and sampling system for the deep vadose zone based on this system the groundwater recharge rate and solute transport were estimated under a given land use type turkeltaub et al 2014 dahan et al 2014 and the impact of switching crop types on water and solute fluxes in the deep vadose zone have been evaluated turkeltaub et al 2015 however in most cases in situ monitoring is not conducted because of its cost and operational complexity therefore a single sampling campaign has been widely applied relying on sediment samples and physical and chemical analyses soil information such as soil water content particle size distribution and concentrations of soluble salts along a deep profile could be obtained and this information could be used to infer the soil water flux groundwater recharge and leached solutes allison and hughes 1983 mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2010a in recent decades soil water flux in the deep vadose zone has been estimated under different land use types in many countries including nigeria edmunds et al 2002 australia allison and hughes 1983 cook et al 1989 silburn et al 2011 china gates et al 2011 lin et al 2013 huang et al 2013 li et al 2017 india scanlon et al 2010b israel rimon et al 2007 dahan et al 2014 turkeltaub et al 2015 and the united states scanlon 1991 harter et al 2005 mcmahon et al 2006 sandvig and phillips 2006 fisher and healy 2008 scanlon et al 2010a adane and gates 2015 soil water flux under agricultural land irrigated and rain fed and native ecosystems has garnered much attention and differences in soil water movement under the two conditions were compared mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2010a silburn et al 2011 lin et al 2013 moreover the soil water flux and or solute leaching under rain fed cropland and irrigated cropland have also been compared scanlon et al 2009 pei et al 2017 the impact of different irrigated crops on soil water movement and solute leaching has also attracted increasing scientific interest during recent years and the types of agricultural land include but are not limited to cereal crops zhang et al 2005 min et al 2017 cotton moss et al 2001 hulugalle et al 2012 wang et al 2012 vegetables song et al 2009 feaga et al 2010 turkeltaub et al 2015 and orchards kurtzman et al 2013 lidón et al 2013 baram et al 2016 different vegetation types natural ecosystems rain fed and irrigated agricultural ecosystems result in the differences in evapotranspiration deep drainage and solute leaching however the comparison of soil water flux and solute transport under different irrigated agricultural lands in the same region is limited north china plain provides 20 of china s food grains and is also one of the regions where groundwater is seriously overexploited because of irrigation yuan and shen 2013 xiao et al 2017 the maximum water table depth exceeds 65 m and the area where the hydraulic head is lower than the sea level covers more than 50 of the entire plain groundwater depletion in the region has caused rivers drying up land subsidence and sea water intrusion zheng et al 2010 in the piedmont region the water table has been continuously declining at a rate of 0 76 m yr guo and shen 2015 and recharge related to excess water from precipitation and irrigation is the dominant recharge mechanism in this area von rohden et al 2010 meanwhile degradation of groundwater quality caused by non point sources and land use change has attracted increasingly attention wang et al 2016 typical agricultural lands in the north china plain include winter wheat and summer maize fruit orchards cotton and vegetables in recent years soil water movement solute transport and accumulation in the deep vadose zone under irrigated cropland planted with winter wheat and summer maize have been extensively researched xue and gao 1987 qiu 1992 li et al 2006 wang et al 2008 lu et al 2011 yuan and pang 2012 min et al 2015 2017 analysis of recharge rates under different land use types has been conducted using tritium and bromide tracers wang et al 2008 which provides the first comprehensive research that focuses on the impacts of land use on groundwater recharge in the north china plain however water movement and inventories of soluble salts in the deep vadose zone under the other three agricultural lands have been less understood based on sediment samples from the deep vadose zone along with physical and chemical analyses the objectives of the present study were to estimate the groundwater recharge rate and velocity of soil water movement investigate the storage and leaching of soluble salts in the deep vadose zone under four typical irrigated agricultural lands winter wheat and summer maize fruit orchards cotton and vegetables and evaluate the relationship between land use types and groundwater quality in the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites description the distribution of the four typical agricultural land use types winter wheat and summer maize wm fruit orchards vegetables ve and cotton co in 2013 is shown in fig 1 pear orchards po were selected for this study a recent study demonstrated that although the cultivated area of each land use type exhibited some change the main growing area remained almost the same wang et al 2015 the current land use types and related planting systems under each type have persisted for more than 30 years in each main growing area therefore the sampling boreholes were all located in the main growing area for each type fig 1 considering that a detailed study on soil water and solute dynamics were analyzed in a previous study min et al 2017 and a few studies on this topic have been conducted under wm xue and gao 1987 qiu 1992 li et al 2006 wang et al 2008 yuan and pang 2012 lin et al 2013 data from a previous study conducted by min et al 2017 site 2 in fig 1 was also used here and only one extra profile was sampled under wm site 1 in fig 1 to minimize the influences of management practices by farmers and to improve representativeness three profiles were sampled under each of the other three land use types a total of 11 boreholes were sampled in march and november 2016 furthermore the sampling sites in the land use types of wm po and ve were all located in the piedmont region of the north china plain with a current water table depth of 41 52 m whereas the sites under co had a relatively shallower water table 13 m table 1 the mean annual precipitation 1981 2013 varies among the sites 489 mm wm 464 mm po 476 mm ve and 499 mm co table 1 vegetables were all planted outdoors in the ve land where sites 6 7 and 8 were located in addition the main kinds of vegetables were eggplant lettuce chinese cabbage cauliflowerbroccoli the vegetables were planted twice in each year all of the sampled sites were irrigated by groundwater flood irrigation and the surveyed irrigation amounts and fertilization in term of kg n ha are listed in table 1 2 2 soil sampling and measurements a manual auger was used for the sampling and the maximum depth is 11 0 m with an interval of 0 2 m two soil samples were collected at each depth one sample was used to determine the gravimetric water content by oven drying the soil samples at 105 c for 24 h the volumetric water content was estimated by multiplying the gravimetric water content by the bulk density however the bulk density below the root zone of the present study could not be measured because of a lack of undisturbed samples nevertheless the value was estimated as 1 6 g cm3 according to the published data in scanlon et al 2009 the average value of the bulk density in the deep vadose zone with a maximum depth of 11 0 m is 1 6 g cm3 the other sample was air dried and water was added with a weight ratio of 5 1 water soil ratio to determine dry soil solute concentrations mg kg which was calculated by multiplying the extract concentrations by the extraction ratio the mixture was then shaken centrifuged and filtered as described in scanlon et al 2010a groundwater samples were also collected from irrigation wells the samples were stored in the laboratory at 4 c and analyzed within one week the concentrations of chloride nitrate and sulfate were measured via an ion chromatography system ics 2100 at the center for agricultural resources research in the institute of genetics and developmental biology at the chinese academy of sciences the pore water concentrations were estimated by dividing the dry soil solute concentration by the gravimetric water content and multiplying by the water density 2 3 data analysis groundwater recharge rates were estimated using the chloride mass balance cmb method eq 1 scanlon et al 2010a the cmb approximation assumes that the sources of chloride are rainfall and irrigation water and that the one dimensional downward vertical water flow and chloride transport reach a steady state if the surface runoff is negligible the chloride input from precipitation p mm yr and irrigation i mm yr balances the chloride output in the recharge r mm yr as follows 1 r pc p ic i c sm where c p mg l and c i mg l are the average chloride concentration in the rainfall and irrigation water respectively and c sm mg l is the depth weighted average chloride concentration in the soil pore water below the root zone except for the fluctuating capillary fringe the chloride concentration in the precipitation at sites 1 2 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 were obtained from min et al 2017 whereas the value at the 3 4 and 5 sites were estimated using the relationship between annual chloride deposition and distance to ocean sources as proposed by guan et al 2010 because recharge rates cannot be measured directly and the accuracy was difficult to evaluate estimated evapotranspiration et was compared with monitored et using eddy covariance systems which can help to assess the accuracy of the estimated recharge flux the long term et mm yr can also be estimated using the soil water balance eq 2 2 et p i r where p i and r are the precipitation mm yr irrigation mm yr and the estimated recharge flux mm yr respectively the change in soil water storage is ignored because eq 2 is used to calculate a long term water balance when the convective transport was considered and the diffusion and dispersion were ignored the piston flow assumption the velocity of solute transport was estimated using eq 3 3 v r 1000 θ where v m yr is the average velocity sometimes called average apparent velocity or seepage velocity hillel 1998 bear and cheng 2010 and r mm yr is the groundwater recharge flux θ cm3 cm3 is the average volumetric water content in the deep vadose zone except for the fluctuating capillary fringe the amount of nitrate nitrogen leaching f kg ha yr at a certain depth can be calculated by eq 4 4 f rc n 100 where c n is the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the soil pore water mg l at a certain depth and r mm yr is the groundwater recharge flux respectively the accumulated solute per unit depth in the vadose zone except for the fluctuating capillary fringe s kg ha m can be estimated by eq 5 5 s k 10 d k c k θ k k d k where d k m is the depth interval c k mg l and θ k cm3 cm3 is the concentration of solute in the soil pore water and the volumetric water content at a given depth k the accumulated solute per unit depth was calculated for the present study because of variability in soil depths at the different sites 3 results 3 1 soil water and solute profile 3 1 1 winter wheat and summer maize the variations in soil water content chloride nitrate and sulfate concentrations with depth under wm land are shown in fig 2 significant variation in the water content with depth in both profiles is easily discerned previous research revealed that the soil water potential in the deep vadose zone is mostly within or slightly higher than field capacity min et al 2017 soil water content is directly related to matric potential and their relationship soil water character curve is mainly controlled by soil texture considering that the variation in matric potential with depth was relatively little we concluded that the variation in soil moisture with depth is mainly attributed to the change in texture with depth below the root zone 2 m the chloride concentrations fluctuates with an average value of 86 and 125 mg l in profile 1 and profile 2 respectively similarly nitrate and sulfate concentrations in these two profiles exhibit similar variations with chloride the average nitrate concentrations in the deep vadose zone in these two profiles at 303 mg l in profile 1 and 242 mg l in profile 2 are in accordance with the nitrogen fertilizer applied at each site table 1 however the average sulfate concentration in the deep vadose zone of profile 1 273 mg l is approximately twice that of profile 2 131 mg l which could not be clearly explained and may be ascribed to the different amount of sulfate contained in the fertilizer apart from nitrogen and irrigation input the differences of root uptake of nitrogen dissolved organic carbon doc content soil water content soil texture and biogeochemical processes can contribute to the spatial variations in nitrate profiles yuan and pang 2012 sigua et al 2017 nevertheless owing to lack of related measurements e g doc 15n and 18o in nitrate in this study the biogeochemical processes at each profile cannot be illustrated and the variations in nitrate concentrations at different profiles cannot also be studied 3 1 2 cotton chloride and sulfate concentrations in the deep vadose zone under co are significantly higher than those under the irrigated wm land fig 3 obvious bulge shaped nitrate and sulfate profiles are found in sites 3 and 5 where the concentrations generally increases throughout the root zone approached a peak value and then decreased with depth and eventually remained constant the bulge shaped chloride profile at site 5 may be explained by water extraction by roots allison et al 1994 disagreement between chloride and nitrate fronts in site 5 was unexpected unlike the profile depicted in fig 2 the bottom of the vadose zone was affected by seasonal change in the water table depth and the fluctuating capillary fringe furthermore the soil approached near saturation while the chloride and nitrate concentrations remained steady below the depth of 9 m in profile 3 7 8 m in profile 4 and 7 6 m in profile 5 because the cotton primary root may penetrate to a depth of over 3 m mcmichael 1986 the maximum depth of root water uptake may exceed 3 m and probably leads to high solute concentrations at greater depth 3 m which differs from the situation under wm land therefore the root zone under cotton was set to be from the ground surface to a depth of 3 m the average solute concentrations were estimated below the root zone and above the fluctuating capillary fringe 9 7 8 and 7 6 m in profile 3 4 and 5 respectively the average chloride concentrations in the three deep vadose zones were 2817 879 and 1188 mg l respectively not surprisingly both chloride and sulfate concentrations in the deep vadose zone are significantly higher than those under wm due to the higher concentrations in irrigation table 1 by contrast the nitrate in the deep vadose zone is only slightly lower than that under wm 3 1 3 vegetables according to the field sample the soil textures beneath a depth of 2 m are almost entirely sand in all three profiles under vegetable cover which led to relatively low soil water content in the deep vadose zone fig 4 chloride and nitrate concentrations in profile 6 exhibit a slightly decreasing trend with soil depth while sulfate concentrations do not vary with depth lower chloride and nitrate concentrations above 2 m compared to those in profile 7 may have resulted from a shift in land use from ve to wm with less irrigation and fertilizer applied sites 7 and 8 have higher chloride concentrations than site 6 which indicates that the soil water flux may have been lower than the value at site 6 meanwhile variation in chloride concentrations with depth in profiles 7 and 8 are significantly different from profile 6 the farmland where site 6 was located was planted with vegetables for more than 30 years as was never planted with winter wheat or summer maize giving rise to less variation however land use types for the farmland where sites 7 and 8 were located occasionally varied having been planted with vegetables winter wheat or summer maize which can result in large variations in solute concentrations 3 1 4 pear orchard the solute profiles of site 9 differ from these of the other two sites under po fig 5 chloride and sulfate increase with depth at site 9 while solute variations with depth display similar patterns to that under wm and co which was a result of disparate fertilization management fertilizers were applied in pits near the pear trees at site 9 while fertilizers were scattered on the ground surface before a flood irrigation event at sites 10 and 11 the high values of chloride in profiles 10 and 11 are found at depths of 3 8 m indicating that the soil water at these depths might have been absorbed by pear trees roots with an average age of more than 30 years therefore the chloride data beneath a depth of 8 m were used to estimate groundwater recharge 3 2 solute storage in the vadose zone the accumulated solutes per unit depth in the vadose zone were calculated based on eq 4 and the values were arithmetically averaged for each land use type and are shown in fig 6 the wm site 1 and 2 and ve site 6 7 and 8 had nearly the same amount of accumulated chloride with a value of 296 and 292 kg ha respectively the greatest value of accumulated chloride 4586 kg ha and sulfate 5935 kg ha in the vadose zone are both under cotton whereas the accumulated sulfate under po 1446 kg ha was only about one quarter of the value under cotton but was slightly higher than that under vegetable 1222 kg ha however the accumulated nitrate under po 1703 kg ha is significantly higher than that under ve 970 kg ha followed by wm 736 kg ha and co 727 kg ha the calculated accumulated solutes per unit depth only represent the solutes stored in the vadose zone however it is the solutes beneath the root zone that are effectively transported downward with soil water the wm land has the lowest average chloride concentration in the deep vadose zone with a value of 105 mg l and the lowest value of nitrate 207 mg l was under po except for wm all three other land use types have much higher sulfate exceeding 750 mg l below the root zone overall the deep vadose zone under wm is characterized by lower chloride sulfate and nitrate concentrations cotton land has a deep vadose zone with higher chloride and sulfate and lower nitrate concentrations vegetable land has a deep vadose zone with lower chloride and higher sulfate and nitrate lower chloride and nitrate concentration with higher sulfate concentration featured the deep vadose zone under po understanding the relationship between land use types and solute storage is important for evaluating impacts of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality scanlon et al 2009 moreover knowledge of the amount of solutes stored in the vadose zone under irrigated agricultural land would also be helpful for quantifying elements balances for example ascott et al 2016 emphasized the importance of nitrate storage in the vadose zone for understanding terrestrial nitrogen budgets 3 3 potential recharge flux and solute transport the estimated recharge flux et average velocity and the amount of annual leached nitrate nitrogen at each site except site 9 are listed in the table 2 to compare the estimated values all items were also averaged by land use type table 2 the average recharge rate under wm co ve and po was 180 27 320 and 49 mm yr respectively moreover even under the same land use types variation in recharge rates can be found which may be attributed to differences in soil texture and water input many studies have been conducted to investigate recharge flux under wm in the piedmont region of the north china plain for example kendy et al 2004 reported that the annual recharge ranges from 50 to 1090 mm during the period from 1949 to 2000 based on a br tracer experiment wang et al 2008 estimated that the recharge rates range from 51 to 245 mm yr using hydrus 1d model the recharge rate is estimated to be 180 mm yr lu et al 2011 tan et al 2014 reported that the recharge fluxes range from 166 to 234 mm yr in most areas of the piedmont plain cao et al 2016 estimated recharge flux in the piedmont region to be 160 mm yr the present result is consistent with the above mentioned research results however recharge fluxes are less known under co ve and po in the north china plain recharge flux under cotton in australia has been reviewed by silburn et al 2013 the typical historical values ranged from 100 to 250 mm yr whereas recent values of 50 100 mm yr were estimated which was a result of optimizing irrigation practices reducing total irrigation estimated values in australia are several times higher than those in the north china plain attributed to higher irrigation amounts in australia silburn et al 2013 the seepage velocity under ve 2 22 m yr is significantly higher than that under other land use types with values of 0 85 m yr under wm 0 81 m yr under vegetables with wm 0 49 m yr under po and 0 09 m yr under co research on seepage flux in the deep vadose zone under wm in the piedmont region of the north china plain were partly summarized by min et al 2015 based on vadose zone data seepage fluxes range from 0 2 to 1 14 m yr qiu 1992 wang et al 2008 tan et al 2014 min et al 2017 furthermore not only land use but also the irrigation regime straw mulch and soil textures would affect the seepage flux wang et al 2008 these were not considered in the present study the annual leached nitrate nitrogen under wm was 108 kg ha which is less than that under vegetables but greater than that under po and cotton table 2 a previous study reveals that the average value of leached nitrate nitrogen in the north china plain is 104 kg ha yr pei et al 2015 which is consistent with the result of this study the vegetable land has the greatest amount of leached nitrate nitrogen 404 kg ha yr which is attributed to the largest amount of irrigation and fertilizer applied table 1 once the vegetable land was occasionally planted with winter wheat or summer maize site 7 and 8 irrigation and fertilization decreased relative to the pure vegetable land site 6 and consequently the leached nitrogen was significantly lower than vegetable land table 2 it is not surprising that both po and co had relatively less leached nitrogen with 23 and 13 kg ha yr respectively because of the lower seepage velocity and average nitrate concentration below the root zone et was also estimated as a supplementary assessment to the accuracy of the estimated recharge flux ve had the greatest et 856 mm yr which is not surprising because vegetables require the largest amount of irrigation the et in wm and po was 679 and 785 mm yr respectively which were in line with the observed values using the eddy covariance systems with 690 and 764 mm yr in wm and po respectively zhang et al 2018 actual et in co in the north china plain under similar management practices as in the present study is estimated to be 541 mm yr by yang et al 2012 and the upper limit of et of cotton in this area is 674 mm yr liu et al 2013 the estimated value of 572 mm yr is within the range of results from the above mentioned research which to some extent enhances the reliability of the estimated recharge flux under cotton land 3 4 impact on groundwater quality the estimated seepage velocity is useful for evaluating the relationship between land use and groundwater quality the rate of water table decline drawdown rate is 0 76 m yr at the piedmont plain guo and shen 2015 and the drawdown rate of a representative well to which sites 1 and 2 were very close is 0 84 m yr min et al 2015 however the average seepage velocity under wm is 0 85 m yr which is almost the same as the rate of decline in the water table this implies that the nitrogen introduced by fertilization may not reach the water table and contaminate the aquifer because water table depth was more than 10 m when simultaneous intensive irrigation groundwater pumping and chemical fertilization were substantially applied in 1970s along with the recharge flux soluble solutes are carried downward however contaminants from chemical fertilization have not been transported into the aquifer and remain stored in the deep vadose zone this is indicated by the comparison of chloride and nitrate concentrations between the deep vadose zone and groundwater the chloride and nitrate concentrations in the deep vadose zone under wm were 105 and 272 mg l fig 6 while the values in groundwater were 36 and 28 mg l a similar situation occurs to the po land while the seepage velocity under po is significantly lower than the rate of decline in the water table the aquifer is also not obviously influenced by this land use type the chloride and nitrate concentrations in the deep vadose zone under po are 183 and 207 mg l fig 6 respectively whereas the values in groundwater are only 15 and 8 mg l in contrast the vegetable cultivation significantly affected the water quality the seepage velocity in deep vadose zone under vegetables 2 22 m yr is about two times higher than the rate of regional water table decline in the piedmont area the chloride and nitrate concentrations in deep vadose zone under ve site 6 are 137 and 558 mg l fig 4 respectively while the values in groundwater were 58 and 161 mg l table 1 the groundwater nitrate pollution problem in the area that was intensively planted with vegetables in the piedmont region of the north china plain had been investigated by gong et al 2004 the results demonstrate that over 23 of groundwater samples exceeded the who standard 50 mg no3 l in 2001 with water table depth of 24 8 m at that time note that preferential flow which is not considered in the aforementioned analyses may play an important role in affecting groundwater quality mcmahon et al 2006 reported that although agricultural chemicals were thought not to reach the underlying aquifer by convective transport through a thick vadose zone they had been actually detected in groundwater which was influenced by preferential flow therefore the calculated convective velocity may underestimate the nitrate fluxes into groundwater 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties uncertainties in estimating recharge flux using cmb method arise from three main aspects the input of chloride transport processes and the output of chloride scanlon 2000 uncertainties in chloride input usually result from irrigation amounts because the chloride input from irrigation is much higher than that from precipitation both dry and wet in this area lin et al 2013 therefore the impact of irrigation amount on the recharge flux was evaluated a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of irrigation amount on the recharge flux and recharge coefficient the ratio of recharge flux to total water input using the method described in lin et al 2013 the results are shown in fig 7 the linear relationship between change in recharge flux and change in irrigation amount is expected because the recharge flux linearly increases with irrigation amount as described in eq 1 overall the recharge coefficient is less sensitive to changes in irrigation amount compared to recharge flux taking site 1 as an example the irrigation amount increased from 340 to 408 mm increased by 20 and the recharge flux is 183 mm with an increment of 24 mm 15 while the recharge coefficient changed from 0 19 to 0 20 with a 5 increase another source of uncertainty of chloride input is the chloride concentration in irrigation water the groundwater was pumped for irrigation and the irrigation water eventually recharges back to the aquifer at higher concentrations and thus the chloride concentrations in groundwater should gradually increase scanlon et al 2005 which may be the reason for the slightly lower chloride concentrations in the profile with depth in site 6 the output of chloride the average concentration in the deep vadose zone is inversely related to recharge flux uncertainty caused by chloride output should be higher at lower chloride concentrations scanlon 2000 which implies that the estimated flux under cotton land would be least impacted by uncertainty in the average concentration below the root zone uncertainties caused by transport processes have been thoroughly discussed by scanlon 2000 flow direction one dimensional flow and preferential flow hydraulic dispersive and diffusive transport of chloride and anion exclusion would all have impacts on the estimated results a previous study revealed that the flow direction is downward below the root zone under wm min et al 2017 which conforms to one of the main assumptions of the cmb method we would expect that the flow direction is also downward below the root zone under vegetable land because of their shallower root depth and more irrigation amount although water potential was not measured under co and po to determine flow direction the targeted depth for estimating recharge flux was selected to be below the probable maximum depth of the roots table 2 which may ensure that the influence of et was excluded considering that most soil samples have very little clay content anion exclusion may be ignored however non one dimensional and preferential flow was reported under some conditions min et al 2017 the cmb method may have underestimated the recharge flux on the other hand ignoring the chloride transported by hydraulic dispersion and diffusion the recharge flux may be overestimated by cmb because some chloride downward movement was caused by hydraulic dispersion and diffusion not only by water flux scanlon 2000 considering that only the convective transport velocity was estimated and the effects of diffusion dispersion and preferential flow were ignored the seepage velocity and leached nitrogen were actually rough estimation 4 2 implication for groundwater resources management the net groundwater loss irrigation minus recharge is shown in table 2 vegetable is the largest consumer of groundwater 380 mm yr followed by po 321 mm yr wm 190 mm yr and co 74 mm yr it is obvious that all the four land use types would result in groundwater over exploitation water saving techniques are urgently needed and an appropriate planting area of each land use type should be evaluated for sustainable groundwater management during the past decades although quite few studies have been conducted on water saving under co ve and po optimizing irrigation strategy to improve irrigation water productivity for the double cropping system wm in this area is one of the important issues concerned by agronomist water use efficiency could be significantly improved under optimized irrigation strategy e g minimum irrigation deficit irrigation yang et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 however even under the optimized water management water consumption under the double cropping system will still cause groundwater over exploitation sun et al 2011 thus less water consumed cropping crop systems e g three crops in two years rather than conventional two crops per year are needed to obtain sustainable groundwater use xiao et al 2017 in fact changing cropping systems has been put into practice in some regions in the north china plain therefore the influences of alternated cropping systems on water flow and solute transport in deep vadose zone are needed to be further studied the leaching fraction the ratio of leached nitrate nitrogen to total nitrogen input under wm co ve and po is estimated to be 18 8 44 and 5 respectively nitrate balance under conventional wm in the north china plain has been well understood and the estimated leaching fractions under wm range from 7 to 16 ju et al 2009 hu et al 2011 pei et al 2015 our result slightly exceeds the reported range which may be caused by the limited sampling sites in this study it is well known that many factors such as climate irrigation amount soil texture and nitrogen input jointly determine the deep drainage and nitrogen leaching mulla and strock 2008 feaga et al 2010 therefore as shown in table 3 the leached nitrogen and the fractions under the same land use types have considerable variation the leaching fractions under co and ve in the north china plain are within the range of the findings in other studies table 3 however under orchard the leaching fraction is significantly lower than the values reported in other regions which may be caused by higher irrigation and deep drainage in these regions the leached nitrogen will impair groundwater quality especially under ve therefore nitrogen management should be improved to reduce groundwater pollution risk ju et al 2009 the simultaneous optimizing of irrigation management and nitrate management needs to be further studied because it has been proven to be a more efficient approach to reduce nitrate leaching letey and vaughan 2013 5 conclusions groundwater recharge and velocity of solute transport under four typical irrigated agricultural land use types winter wheat and summer maize pear orchards outdoor vegetables and cotton were investigated based on sediment sampling and physical and chemical analysis the chloride mass balance method was used to estimate the groundwater recharge rate the average recharge rates under wm co ve and po were 180 27 320 and 49 mm yr respectively which were influenced by water input precipitation and irrigation evaporation transpiration dominated by vegetation and soil moisture and hydrogeological settings soil texture and layering corresponding with the greatest value in the recharge rate the seepage velocity under ve also exceeded the values under the other three land use types the seepage velocity and the rate of water table decline in the piedmont region were compared to evaluate the nitrate contamination in groundwater the results revealed that highest seepage velocity under ve had caused significant nitrate contamination in groundwater whereas the other two land use types wm and po had no direct influences on the groundwater quality the vadose zone under the four irrigated agricultural lands stored many solutes the storage nitrate per unit depth in the vadose zone under po showed the highest value followed by ve wm and co however the amount of leached nitrate under the four land use types displayed different orders of stored nitrate ve wm co po which is closely related to the downward soil water flux and solute concentrations below the root zone it should be noted that the maximum depth no more than 11 m is still limited compared with the deep water table 40 m and the water movement solute concentration and storage in the deeper vadose zone could not be investigated furthermore the number of sampling sites in the four land use types should be increased to reduce uncertainties and for better representativeness diffusion dispersion and preferential flow were excluded in this study and the seepage velocity and leached nitrogen were actually roughly estimated more tracers and techniques should be applied in future studies to obtain more precise results however we believe that the results of the present study are useful for groundwater resources management acknowledgements

7400,groundwater fed agriculture has caused water table declines and groundwater quality degradation in the north china plain based on sediment sampling in deep vadose zone with a maximum depth of 11 0 m groundwater recharge seepage velocity solute inventory and transport under four typical irrigated agricultural land use types winter wheat and summer maize wm pear orchards po outdoor vegetables ve and cotton co were investigated in this study the results reveal that there are many solutes stored in the vadose zone nitrate storage per unit depth in the vadose zone is highest under po 1703 kg ha followed by ve 970 kg ha wm 736 kg ha and co 727 kg ha however the amount of annual leached nitrate under the four land use types results in a different order ve 404 kg ha wm 108 kg ha po 23 kg ha co 13 kg ha the estimated average recharge rates are 180 mm yr for wm 27 mm yr for co 320 mm yr for ve and 49 mm yr for po the seepage velocity under ve 2 22 m yr exceeds the values under the other three land use types wm 0 85 m yr po 0 49 m yr co 0 09 m yr the highest seepage velocity under ve caused significant nitrate contamination in groundwater whereas the other two land use types wm and po had no direct influence on groundwater quality the results of this work could be used for groundwater resources management keywords agricultural land use types deep vadose zone groundwater recharge solute transport north china plain 1 introduction agricultural land use activities not only produce food for increasing human needs but also influence the quantity and quality of freshwater resources especially in areas with irrigated crop lands foley et al 2005 according to previous studies the irrigation sector accounts for 70 of the global water demand and the total groundwater used for irrigation is responsible for 43 of the global irrigation water demand which gives rise to groundwater overexploitation siebert et al 2010 wada et al 2012 wada et al 2013 in addition a large quantity of soluble salts in irrigated water as well as agricultural chemicals may be transported into the underlying aquifers which can profoundly affect groundwater quality böhlke 2002 scanlon et al 2010a russo et al 2014 therefore intensive agriculture has been widely reported as a cause of worldwide water table decline and leached agricultural chemicals into groundwater the vadose zone connecting the land surface and groundwater and acting as a buffer and filter zone in which the water flow and solute transport are attenuated and contaminants are absorbed degraded and transformed plays an important role in the quality and quantity of groundwater resources harter and hopmans 2004 nimmo 2005 in an area with a deep water table water percolates from the root zone to the deep vadose zone and the process results in deep drainage or potential groundwater recharge de vries and simmers 2002 if the influence of an impeding layer is absent the water will eventually reach the aquifer and becoming actual recharge meanwhile solutes and many other agricultural chemicals would be transported with soil water as a consequence groundwater may become contaminated scanlon et al 2010a nitrate pollution in groundwater caused by agricultural practice is a common problem across the globe diez et al 2000 böhlke 2002 kundu and mandal 2009 under improper irrigation lots of nitrate will be flushed out of root zone into deep vadose zone and the leached nitrate will ultimately move to aquifer without sufficient denitrification because of low available carbon source in deep vadose zone yuan et al 2017 therefore investigation of soil water movement and solute transport in the deep vadose zone under cropland could aid groundwater resources management based on deep vadose zone data which were obtained by continuous monitoring or campaign type sampling the potential groundwater recharge and solute leaching under different land use types have been extensively investigated in order to evaluate the dynamics of soil water and solute concentrations dahan et al 2009 invented a slanted monitoring and sampling system for the deep vadose zone based on this system the groundwater recharge rate and solute transport were estimated under a given land use type turkeltaub et al 2014 dahan et al 2014 and the impact of switching crop types on water and solute fluxes in the deep vadose zone have been evaluated turkeltaub et al 2015 however in most cases in situ monitoring is not conducted because of its cost and operational complexity therefore a single sampling campaign has been widely applied relying on sediment samples and physical and chemical analyses soil information such as soil water content particle size distribution and concentrations of soluble salts along a deep profile could be obtained and this information could be used to infer the soil water flux groundwater recharge and leached solutes allison and hughes 1983 mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2010a in recent decades soil water flux in the deep vadose zone has been estimated under different land use types in many countries including nigeria edmunds et al 2002 australia allison and hughes 1983 cook et al 1989 silburn et al 2011 china gates et al 2011 lin et al 2013 huang et al 2013 li et al 2017 india scanlon et al 2010b israel rimon et al 2007 dahan et al 2014 turkeltaub et al 2015 and the united states scanlon 1991 harter et al 2005 mcmahon et al 2006 sandvig and phillips 2006 fisher and healy 2008 scanlon et al 2010a adane and gates 2015 soil water flux under agricultural land irrigated and rain fed and native ecosystems has garnered much attention and differences in soil water movement under the two conditions were compared mcmahon et al 2006 scanlon et al 2010a silburn et al 2011 lin et al 2013 moreover the soil water flux and or solute leaching under rain fed cropland and irrigated cropland have also been compared scanlon et al 2009 pei et al 2017 the impact of different irrigated crops on soil water movement and solute leaching has also attracted increasing scientific interest during recent years and the types of agricultural land include but are not limited to cereal crops zhang et al 2005 min et al 2017 cotton moss et al 2001 hulugalle et al 2012 wang et al 2012 vegetables song et al 2009 feaga et al 2010 turkeltaub et al 2015 and orchards kurtzman et al 2013 lidón et al 2013 baram et al 2016 different vegetation types natural ecosystems rain fed and irrigated agricultural ecosystems result in the differences in evapotranspiration deep drainage and solute leaching however the comparison of soil water flux and solute transport under different irrigated agricultural lands in the same region is limited north china plain provides 20 of china s food grains and is also one of the regions where groundwater is seriously overexploited because of irrigation yuan and shen 2013 xiao et al 2017 the maximum water table depth exceeds 65 m and the area where the hydraulic head is lower than the sea level covers more than 50 of the entire plain groundwater depletion in the region has caused rivers drying up land subsidence and sea water intrusion zheng et al 2010 in the piedmont region the water table has been continuously declining at a rate of 0 76 m yr guo and shen 2015 and recharge related to excess water from precipitation and irrigation is the dominant recharge mechanism in this area von rohden et al 2010 meanwhile degradation of groundwater quality caused by non point sources and land use change has attracted increasingly attention wang et al 2016 typical agricultural lands in the north china plain include winter wheat and summer maize fruit orchards cotton and vegetables in recent years soil water movement solute transport and accumulation in the deep vadose zone under irrigated cropland planted with winter wheat and summer maize have been extensively researched xue and gao 1987 qiu 1992 li et al 2006 wang et al 2008 lu et al 2011 yuan and pang 2012 min et al 2015 2017 analysis of recharge rates under different land use types has been conducted using tritium and bromide tracers wang et al 2008 which provides the first comprehensive research that focuses on the impacts of land use on groundwater recharge in the north china plain however water movement and inventories of soluble salts in the deep vadose zone under the other three agricultural lands have been less understood based on sediment samples from the deep vadose zone along with physical and chemical analyses the objectives of the present study were to estimate the groundwater recharge rate and velocity of soil water movement investigate the storage and leaching of soluble salts in the deep vadose zone under four typical irrigated agricultural lands winter wheat and summer maize fruit orchards cotton and vegetables and evaluate the relationship between land use types and groundwater quality in the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites description the distribution of the four typical agricultural land use types winter wheat and summer maize wm fruit orchards vegetables ve and cotton co in 2013 is shown in fig 1 pear orchards po were selected for this study a recent study demonstrated that although the cultivated area of each land use type exhibited some change the main growing area remained almost the same wang et al 2015 the current land use types and related planting systems under each type have persisted for more than 30 years in each main growing area therefore the sampling boreholes were all located in the main growing area for each type fig 1 considering that a detailed study on soil water and solute dynamics were analyzed in a previous study min et al 2017 and a few studies on this topic have been conducted under wm xue and gao 1987 qiu 1992 li et al 2006 wang et al 2008 yuan and pang 2012 lin et al 2013 data from a previous study conducted by min et al 2017 site 2 in fig 1 was also used here and only one extra profile was sampled under wm site 1 in fig 1 to minimize the influences of management practices by farmers and to improve representativeness three profiles were sampled under each of the other three land use types a total of 11 boreholes were sampled in march and november 2016 furthermore the sampling sites in the land use types of wm po and ve were all located in the piedmont region of the north china plain with a current water table depth of 41 52 m whereas the sites under co had a relatively shallower water table 13 m table 1 the mean annual precipitation 1981 2013 varies among the sites 489 mm wm 464 mm po 476 mm ve and 499 mm co table 1 vegetables were all planted outdoors in the ve land where sites 6 7 and 8 were located in addition the main kinds of vegetables were eggplant lettuce chinese cabbage cauliflowerbroccoli the vegetables were planted twice in each year all of the sampled sites were irrigated by groundwater flood irrigation and the surveyed irrigation amounts and fertilization in term of kg n ha are listed in table 1 2 2 soil sampling and measurements a manual auger was used for the sampling and the maximum depth is 11 0 m with an interval of 0 2 m two soil samples were collected at each depth one sample was used to determine the gravimetric water content by oven drying the soil samples at 105 c for 24 h the volumetric water content was estimated by multiplying the gravimetric water content by the bulk density however the bulk density below the root zone of the present study could not be measured because of a lack of undisturbed samples nevertheless the value was estimated as 1 6 g cm3 according to the published data in scanlon et al 2009 the average value of the bulk density in the deep vadose zone with a maximum depth of 11 0 m is 1 6 g cm3 the other sample was air dried and water was added with a weight ratio of 5 1 water soil ratio to determine dry soil solute concentrations mg kg which was calculated by multiplying the extract concentrations by the extraction ratio the mixture was then shaken centrifuged and filtered as described in scanlon et al 2010a groundwater samples were also collected from irrigation wells the samples were stored in the laboratory at 4 c and analyzed within one week the concentrations of chloride nitrate and sulfate were measured via an ion chromatography system ics 2100 at the center for agricultural resources research in the institute of genetics and developmental biology at the chinese academy of sciences the pore water concentrations were estimated by dividing the dry soil solute concentration by the gravimetric water content and multiplying by the water density 2 3 data analysis groundwater recharge rates were estimated using the chloride mass balance cmb method eq 1 scanlon et al 2010a the cmb approximation assumes that the sources of chloride are rainfall and irrigation water and that the one dimensional downward vertical water flow and chloride transport reach a steady state if the surface runoff is negligible the chloride input from precipitation p mm yr and irrigation i mm yr balances the chloride output in the recharge r mm yr as follows 1 r pc p ic i c sm where c p mg l and c i mg l are the average chloride concentration in the rainfall and irrigation water respectively and c sm mg l is the depth weighted average chloride concentration in the soil pore water below the root zone except for the fluctuating capillary fringe the chloride concentration in the precipitation at sites 1 2 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 were obtained from min et al 2017 whereas the value at the 3 4 and 5 sites were estimated using the relationship between annual chloride deposition and distance to ocean sources as proposed by guan et al 2010 because recharge rates cannot be measured directly and the accuracy was difficult to evaluate estimated evapotranspiration et was compared with monitored et using eddy covariance systems which can help to assess the accuracy of the estimated recharge flux the long term et mm yr can also be estimated using the soil water balance eq 2 2 et p i r where p i and r are the precipitation mm yr irrigation mm yr and the estimated recharge flux mm yr respectively the change in soil water storage is ignored because eq 2 is used to calculate a long term water balance when the convective transport was considered and the diffusion and dispersion were ignored the piston flow assumption the velocity of solute transport was estimated using eq 3 3 v r 1000 θ where v m yr is the average velocity sometimes called average apparent velocity or seepage velocity hillel 1998 bear and cheng 2010 and r mm yr is the groundwater recharge flux θ cm3 cm3 is the average volumetric water content in the deep vadose zone except for the fluctuating capillary fringe the amount of nitrate nitrogen leaching f kg ha yr at a certain depth can be calculated by eq 4 4 f rc n 100 where c n is the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the soil pore water mg l at a certain depth and r mm yr is the groundwater recharge flux respectively the accumulated solute per unit depth in the vadose zone except for the fluctuating capillary fringe s kg ha m can be estimated by eq 5 5 s k 10 d k c k θ k k d k where d k m is the depth interval c k mg l and θ k cm3 cm3 is the concentration of solute in the soil pore water and the volumetric water content at a given depth k the accumulated solute per unit depth was calculated for the present study because of variability in soil depths at the different sites 3 results 3 1 soil water and solute profile 3 1 1 winter wheat and summer maize the variations in soil water content chloride nitrate and sulfate concentrations with depth under wm land are shown in fig 2 significant variation in the water content with depth in both profiles is easily discerned previous research revealed that the soil water potential in the deep vadose zone is mostly within or slightly higher than field capacity min et al 2017 soil water content is directly related to matric potential and their relationship soil water character curve is mainly controlled by soil texture considering that the variation in matric potential with depth was relatively little we concluded that the variation in soil moisture with depth is mainly attributed to the change in texture with depth below the root zone 2 m the chloride concentrations fluctuates with an average value of 86 and 125 mg l in profile 1 and profile 2 respectively similarly nitrate and sulfate concentrations in these two profiles exhibit similar variations with chloride the average nitrate concentrations in the deep vadose zone in these two profiles at 303 mg l in profile 1 and 242 mg l in profile 2 are in accordance with the nitrogen fertilizer applied at each site table 1 however the average sulfate concentration in the deep vadose zone of profile 1 273 mg l is approximately twice that of profile 2 131 mg l which could not be clearly explained and may be ascribed to the different amount of sulfate contained in the fertilizer apart from nitrogen and irrigation input the differences of root uptake of nitrogen dissolved organic carbon doc content soil water content soil texture and biogeochemical processes can contribute to the spatial variations in nitrate profiles yuan and pang 2012 sigua et al 2017 nevertheless owing to lack of related measurements e g doc 15n and 18o in nitrate in this study the biogeochemical processes at each profile cannot be illustrated and the variations in nitrate concentrations at different profiles cannot also be studied 3 1 2 cotton chloride and sulfate concentrations in the deep vadose zone under co are significantly higher than those under the irrigated wm land fig 3 obvious bulge shaped nitrate and sulfate profiles are found in sites 3 and 5 where the concentrations generally increases throughout the root zone approached a peak value and then decreased with depth and eventually remained constant the bulge shaped chloride profile at site 5 may be explained by water extraction by roots allison et al 1994 disagreement between chloride and nitrate fronts in site 5 was unexpected unlike the profile depicted in fig 2 the bottom of the vadose zone was affected by seasonal change in the water table depth and the fluctuating capillary fringe furthermore the soil approached near saturation while the chloride and nitrate concentrations remained steady below the depth of 9 m in profile 3 7 8 m in profile 4 and 7 6 m in profile 5 because the cotton primary root may penetrate to a depth of over 3 m mcmichael 1986 the maximum depth of root water uptake may exceed 3 m and probably leads to high solute concentrations at greater depth 3 m which differs from the situation under wm land therefore the root zone under cotton was set to be from the ground surface to a depth of 3 m the average solute concentrations were estimated below the root zone and above the fluctuating capillary fringe 9 7 8 and 7 6 m in profile 3 4 and 5 respectively the average chloride concentrations in the three deep vadose zones were 2817 879 and 1188 mg l respectively not surprisingly both chloride and sulfate concentrations in the deep vadose zone are significantly higher than those under wm due to the higher concentrations in irrigation table 1 by contrast the nitrate in the deep vadose zone is only slightly lower than that under wm 3 1 3 vegetables according to the field sample the soil textures beneath a depth of 2 m are almost entirely sand in all three profiles under vegetable cover which led to relatively low soil water content in the deep vadose zone fig 4 chloride and nitrate concentrations in profile 6 exhibit a slightly decreasing trend with soil depth while sulfate concentrations do not vary with depth lower chloride and nitrate concentrations above 2 m compared to those in profile 7 may have resulted from a shift in land use from ve to wm with less irrigation and fertilizer applied sites 7 and 8 have higher chloride concentrations than site 6 which indicates that the soil water flux may have been lower than the value at site 6 meanwhile variation in chloride concentrations with depth in profiles 7 and 8 are significantly different from profile 6 the farmland where site 6 was located was planted with vegetables for more than 30 years as was never planted with winter wheat or summer maize giving rise to less variation however land use types for the farmland where sites 7 and 8 were located occasionally varied having been planted with vegetables winter wheat or summer maize which can result in large variations in solute concentrations 3 1 4 pear orchard the solute profiles of site 9 differ from these of the other two sites under po fig 5 chloride and sulfate increase with depth at site 9 while solute variations with depth display similar patterns to that under wm and co which was a result of disparate fertilization management fertilizers were applied in pits near the pear trees at site 9 while fertilizers were scattered on the ground surface before a flood irrigation event at sites 10 and 11 the high values of chloride in profiles 10 and 11 are found at depths of 3 8 m indicating that the soil water at these depths might have been absorbed by pear trees roots with an average age of more than 30 years therefore the chloride data beneath a depth of 8 m were used to estimate groundwater recharge 3 2 solute storage in the vadose zone the accumulated solutes per unit depth in the vadose zone were calculated based on eq 4 and the values were arithmetically averaged for each land use type and are shown in fig 6 the wm site 1 and 2 and ve site 6 7 and 8 had nearly the same amount of accumulated chloride with a value of 296 and 292 kg ha respectively the greatest value of accumulated chloride 4586 kg ha and sulfate 5935 kg ha in the vadose zone are both under cotton whereas the accumulated sulfate under po 1446 kg ha was only about one quarter of the value under cotton but was slightly higher than that under vegetable 1222 kg ha however the accumulated nitrate under po 1703 kg ha is significantly higher than that under ve 970 kg ha followed by wm 736 kg ha and co 727 kg ha the calculated accumulated solutes per unit depth only represent the solutes stored in the vadose zone however it is the solutes beneath the root zone that are effectively transported downward with soil water the wm land has the lowest average chloride concentration in the deep vadose zone with a value of 105 mg l and the lowest value of nitrate 207 mg l was under po except for wm all three other land use types have much higher sulfate exceeding 750 mg l below the root zone overall the deep vadose zone under wm is characterized by lower chloride sulfate and nitrate concentrations cotton land has a deep vadose zone with higher chloride and sulfate and lower nitrate concentrations vegetable land has a deep vadose zone with lower chloride and higher sulfate and nitrate lower chloride and nitrate concentration with higher sulfate concentration featured the deep vadose zone under po understanding the relationship between land use types and solute storage is important for evaluating impacts of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality scanlon et al 2009 moreover knowledge of the amount of solutes stored in the vadose zone under irrigated agricultural land would also be helpful for quantifying elements balances for example ascott et al 2016 emphasized the importance of nitrate storage in the vadose zone for understanding terrestrial nitrogen budgets 3 3 potential recharge flux and solute transport the estimated recharge flux et average velocity and the amount of annual leached nitrate nitrogen at each site except site 9 are listed in the table 2 to compare the estimated values all items were also averaged by land use type table 2 the average recharge rate under wm co ve and po was 180 27 320 and 49 mm yr respectively moreover even under the same land use types variation in recharge rates can be found which may be attributed to differences in soil texture and water input many studies have been conducted to investigate recharge flux under wm in the piedmont region of the north china plain for example kendy et al 2004 reported that the annual recharge ranges from 50 to 1090 mm during the period from 1949 to 2000 based on a br tracer experiment wang et al 2008 estimated that the recharge rates range from 51 to 245 mm yr using hydrus 1d model the recharge rate is estimated to be 180 mm yr lu et al 2011 tan et al 2014 reported that the recharge fluxes range from 166 to 234 mm yr in most areas of the piedmont plain cao et al 2016 estimated recharge flux in the piedmont region to be 160 mm yr the present result is consistent with the above mentioned research results however recharge fluxes are less known under co ve and po in the north china plain recharge flux under cotton in australia has been reviewed by silburn et al 2013 the typical historical values ranged from 100 to 250 mm yr whereas recent values of 50 100 mm yr were estimated which was a result of optimizing irrigation practices reducing total irrigation estimated values in australia are several times higher than those in the north china plain attributed to higher irrigation amounts in australia silburn et al 2013 the seepage velocity under ve 2 22 m yr is significantly higher than that under other land use types with values of 0 85 m yr under wm 0 81 m yr under vegetables with wm 0 49 m yr under po and 0 09 m yr under co research on seepage flux in the deep vadose zone under wm in the piedmont region of the north china plain were partly summarized by min et al 2015 based on vadose zone data seepage fluxes range from 0 2 to 1 14 m yr qiu 1992 wang et al 2008 tan et al 2014 min et al 2017 furthermore not only land use but also the irrigation regime straw mulch and soil textures would affect the seepage flux wang et al 2008 these were not considered in the present study the annual leached nitrate nitrogen under wm was 108 kg ha which is less than that under vegetables but greater than that under po and cotton table 2 a previous study reveals that the average value of leached nitrate nitrogen in the north china plain is 104 kg ha yr pei et al 2015 which is consistent with the result of this study the vegetable land has the greatest amount of leached nitrate nitrogen 404 kg ha yr which is attributed to the largest amount of irrigation and fertilizer applied table 1 once the vegetable land was occasionally planted with winter wheat or summer maize site 7 and 8 irrigation and fertilization decreased relative to the pure vegetable land site 6 and consequently the leached nitrogen was significantly lower than vegetable land table 2 it is not surprising that both po and co had relatively less leached nitrogen with 23 and 13 kg ha yr respectively because of the lower seepage velocity and average nitrate concentration below the root zone et was also estimated as a supplementary assessment to the accuracy of the estimated recharge flux ve had the greatest et 856 mm yr which is not surprising because vegetables require the largest amount of irrigation the et in wm and po was 679 and 785 mm yr respectively which were in line with the observed values using the eddy covariance systems with 690 and 764 mm yr in wm and po respectively zhang et al 2018 actual et in co in the north china plain under similar management practices as in the present study is estimated to be 541 mm yr by yang et al 2012 and the upper limit of et of cotton in this area is 674 mm yr liu et al 2013 the estimated value of 572 mm yr is within the range of results from the above mentioned research which to some extent enhances the reliability of the estimated recharge flux under cotton land 3 4 impact on groundwater quality the estimated seepage velocity is useful for evaluating the relationship between land use and groundwater quality the rate of water table decline drawdown rate is 0 76 m yr at the piedmont plain guo and shen 2015 and the drawdown rate of a representative well to which sites 1 and 2 were very close is 0 84 m yr min et al 2015 however the average seepage velocity under wm is 0 85 m yr which is almost the same as the rate of decline in the water table this implies that the nitrogen introduced by fertilization may not reach the water table and contaminate the aquifer because water table depth was more than 10 m when simultaneous intensive irrigation groundwater pumping and chemical fertilization were substantially applied in 1970s along with the recharge flux soluble solutes are carried downward however contaminants from chemical fertilization have not been transported into the aquifer and remain stored in the deep vadose zone this is indicated by the comparison of chloride and nitrate concentrations between the deep vadose zone and groundwater the chloride and nitrate concentrations in the deep vadose zone under wm were 105 and 272 mg l fig 6 while the values in groundwater were 36 and 28 mg l a similar situation occurs to the po land while the seepage velocity under po is significantly lower than the rate of decline in the water table the aquifer is also not obviously influenced by this land use type the chloride and nitrate concentrations in the deep vadose zone under po are 183 and 207 mg l fig 6 respectively whereas the values in groundwater are only 15 and 8 mg l in contrast the vegetable cultivation significantly affected the water quality the seepage velocity in deep vadose zone under vegetables 2 22 m yr is about two times higher than the rate of regional water table decline in the piedmont area the chloride and nitrate concentrations in deep vadose zone under ve site 6 are 137 and 558 mg l fig 4 respectively while the values in groundwater were 58 and 161 mg l table 1 the groundwater nitrate pollution problem in the area that was intensively planted with vegetables in the piedmont region of the north china plain had been investigated by gong et al 2004 the results demonstrate that over 23 of groundwater samples exceeded the who standard 50 mg no3 l in 2001 with water table depth of 24 8 m at that time note that preferential flow which is not considered in the aforementioned analyses may play an important role in affecting groundwater quality mcmahon et al 2006 reported that although agricultural chemicals were thought not to reach the underlying aquifer by convective transport through a thick vadose zone they had been actually detected in groundwater which was influenced by preferential flow therefore the calculated convective velocity may underestimate the nitrate fluxes into groundwater 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties uncertainties in estimating recharge flux using cmb method arise from three main aspects the input of chloride transport processes and the output of chloride scanlon 2000 uncertainties in chloride input usually result from irrigation amounts because the chloride input from irrigation is much higher than that from precipitation both dry and wet in this area lin et al 2013 therefore the impact of irrigation amount on the recharge flux was evaluated a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of irrigation amount on the recharge flux and recharge coefficient the ratio of recharge flux to total water input using the method described in lin et al 2013 the results are shown in fig 7 the linear relationship between change in recharge flux and change in irrigation amount is expected because the recharge flux linearly increases with irrigation amount as described in eq 1 overall the recharge coefficient is less sensitive to changes in irrigation amount compared to recharge flux taking site 1 as an example the irrigation amount increased from 340 to 408 mm increased by 20 and the recharge flux is 183 mm with an increment of 24 mm 15 while the recharge coefficient changed from 0 19 to 0 20 with a 5 increase another source of uncertainty of chloride input is the chloride concentration in irrigation water the groundwater was pumped for irrigation and the irrigation water eventually recharges back to the aquifer at higher concentrations and thus the chloride concentrations in groundwater should gradually increase scanlon et al 2005 which may be the reason for the slightly lower chloride concentrations in the profile with depth in site 6 the output of chloride the average concentration in the deep vadose zone is inversely related to recharge flux uncertainty caused by chloride output should be higher at lower chloride concentrations scanlon 2000 which implies that the estimated flux under cotton land would be least impacted by uncertainty in the average concentration below the root zone uncertainties caused by transport processes have been thoroughly discussed by scanlon 2000 flow direction one dimensional flow and preferential flow hydraulic dispersive and diffusive transport of chloride and anion exclusion would all have impacts on the estimated results a previous study revealed that the flow direction is downward below the root zone under wm min et al 2017 which conforms to one of the main assumptions of the cmb method we would expect that the flow direction is also downward below the root zone under vegetable land because of their shallower root depth and more irrigation amount although water potential was not measured under co and po to determine flow direction the targeted depth for estimating recharge flux was selected to be below the probable maximum depth of the roots table 2 which may ensure that the influence of et was excluded considering that most soil samples have very little clay content anion exclusion may be ignored however non one dimensional and preferential flow was reported under some conditions min et al 2017 the cmb method may have underestimated the recharge flux on the other hand ignoring the chloride transported by hydraulic dispersion and diffusion the recharge flux may be overestimated by cmb because some chloride downward movement was caused by hydraulic dispersion and diffusion not only by water flux scanlon 2000 considering that only the convective transport velocity was estimated and the effects of diffusion dispersion and preferential flow were ignored the seepage velocity and leached nitrogen were actually rough estimation 4 2 implication for groundwater resources management the net groundwater loss irrigation minus recharge is shown in table 2 vegetable is the largest consumer of groundwater 380 mm yr followed by po 321 mm yr wm 190 mm yr and co 74 mm yr it is obvious that all the four land use types would result in groundwater over exploitation water saving techniques are urgently needed and an appropriate planting area of each land use type should be evaluated for sustainable groundwater management during the past decades although quite few studies have been conducted on water saving under co ve and po optimizing irrigation strategy to improve irrigation water productivity for the double cropping system wm in this area is one of the important issues concerned by agronomist water use efficiency could be significantly improved under optimized irrigation strategy e g minimum irrigation deficit irrigation yang et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 however even under the optimized water management water consumption under the double cropping system will still cause groundwater over exploitation sun et al 2011 thus less water consumed cropping crop systems e g three crops in two years rather than conventional two crops per year are needed to obtain sustainable groundwater use xiao et al 2017 in fact changing cropping systems has been put into practice in some regions in the north china plain therefore the influences of alternated cropping systems on water flow and solute transport in deep vadose zone are needed to be further studied the leaching fraction the ratio of leached nitrate nitrogen to total nitrogen input under wm co ve and po is estimated to be 18 8 44 and 5 respectively nitrate balance under conventional wm in the north china plain has been well understood and the estimated leaching fractions under wm range from 7 to 16 ju et al 2009 hu et al 2011 pei et al 2015 our result slightly exceeds the reported range which may be caused by the limited sampling sites in this study it is well known that many factors such as climate irrigation amount soil texture and nitrogen input jointly determine the deep drainage and nitrogen leaching mulla and strock 2008 feaga et al 2010 therefore as shown in table 3 the leached nitrogen and the fractions under the same land use types have considerable variation the leaching fractions under co and ve in the north china plain are within the range of the findings in other studies table 3 however under orchard the leaching fraction is significantly lower than the values reported in other regions which may be caused by higher irrigation and deep drainage in these regions the leached nitrogen will impair groundwater quality especially under ve therefore nitrogen management should be improved to reduce groundwater pollution risk ju et al 2009 the simultaneous optimizing of irrigation management and nitrate management needs to be further studied because it has been proven to be a more efficient approach to reduce nitrate leaching letey and vaughan 2013 5 conclusions groundwater recharge and velocity of solute transport under four typical irrigated agricultural land use types winter wheat and summer maize pear orchards outdoor vegetables and cotton were investigated based on sediment sampling and physical and chemical analysis the chloride mass balance method was used to estimate the groundwater recharge rate the average recharge rates under wm co ve and po were 180 27 320 and 49 mm yr respectively which were influenced by water input precipitation and irrigation evaporation transpiration dominated by vegetation and soil moisture and hydrogeological settings soil texture and layering corresponding with the greatest value in the recharge rate the seepage velocity under ve also exceeded the values under the other three land use types the seepage velocity and the rate of water table decline in the piedmont region were compared to evaluate the nitrate contamination in groundwater the results revealed that highest seepage velocity under ve had caused significant nitrate contamination in groundwater whereas the other two land use types wm and po had no direct influences on the groundwater quality the vadose zone under the four irrigated agricultural lands stored many solutes the storage nitrate per unit depth in the vadose zone under po showed the highest value followed by ve wm and co however the amount of leached nitrate under the four land use types displayed different orders of stored nitrate ve wm co po which is closely related to the downward soil water flux and solute concentrations below the root zone it should be noted that the maximum depth no more than 11 m is still limited compared with the deep water table 40 m and the water movement solute concentration and storage in the deeper vadose zone could not be investigated furthermore the number of sampling sites in the four land use types should be increased to reduce uncertainties and for better representativeness diffusion dispersion and preferential flow were excluded in this study and the seepage velocity and leached nitrogen were actually roughly estimated more tracers and techniques should be applied in future studies to obtain more precise results however we believe that the results of the present study are useful for groundwater resources management acknowledgements

7401,to understand the characteristics of ca isotope composition and fractionation in silicate dominated quaternary aquifer system hydrochemical and isotope studies 87sr 86sr 13cdic and 44 40ca were conducted on groundwater sediment and rock samples from the datong basin china along the groundwater flow path from the basin margin to the center groundwater hydrochemical type evolves from ca hco3 to na hco3 na cl type which results from aluminosilicate hydrolysis vertical mixing cation exchange between cax2 and nax and calcite dolomite precipitation these processes cause the decrease in groundwater ca concentration and the associated modest fractionation of groundwater ca isotopes along the flowpath the groundwater δ 44 40ca value varies from 0 11 to 0 49 the elevated δ 44 40ca ratios in shallow groundwater are attributed to vertical mixing involving addition of irrigation water which had the average δ 44 40ca ratio of 0 595 chemical weathering of silicate minerals and carbonate generates depleted δ 44 40ca signatures in groundwater from heng mountain east area and huanghua uplift west area respectively along the groundwater flow path from heng mountain to central area of east area cation exchange between cax2 and nax on clay mineral results in the enrichment of heavier ca isotope in groundwater all groundwater samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite the groundwater environment rich in organic matter promotes the precipitation of carbonate minerals via the biodegradation of organic carbon thereby further promoting the elevation of groundwater δ 44 40ca ratios keywords silicate system calcium isotope fractionation groundwater 1 introduction recent advances in geochemical studies of stable isotopes such as sr and ca in groundwater have substantially improved our understanding of water rock interactions and solute transport processes i g cartwright et al 2010 gosselin et al 2004 zhu and macdougall 1998 calcium is one of the more abundant metal elements in the earth s crust and understanding the effects of various physical and chemical processes on its isotope fractionation could provide new perspectives on the evolution of many natural systems ca isotope variation and fractionation have been inferred to be due to secondary precipitation of ca bearing phases hindshaw et al 2013 source mixing processes jacobson et al 2015 ion exchange ockert et al 2013 biological processes böhm et al 2006 and plant uptake bagard et al 2013 generally inorganic calcite grown at moderate solution oversaturation preferentially excludes 44ca and the degree of 40ca enrichment is dependent on precipitation rate and solution temperature tang et al 2008 since the elemental role played by ca in the lithosphere biosphere and hydrosphere the understanding the mechanism of ca isotope fractionation helps to develop the ca isotope as a potential tracer in the oceanic setting ca sedimentation is considered to be a critical recorder of ocean evolution and therefore ca isotope is helpful to reconstruct the fluctuation of ocean ca concentration through geologic time griffith et al 2008 the variations of ca isotope of marine carbonate also provide information on the weathering and or depositional mode within the ocean fantle 2010 additionally the ca isotopes have been proposed as a proxy for the global carbon cycle and paleo sea surface temperatures griffith et al 2008 nägler et al 2000 compared to studies on ca isotope fractionation in carbonate dominated settings little work has been conducted on ca cycling and isotope fractionation in silicate systems jacobson et al 2015 moore et al 2013 silicate rocks and minerals have a somewhat larger range of δ 44 40ca than carbonate rocks fantle and tipper 2014 therefore it is not surprising that water in silicate systems would exhibit different ca isotope signatures from those in carbonate systems up to now the ca isotope signatures of groundwater in silicate aquifers have not been systematically evaluated therefore theoretical and case studies on silicate dominated cenozoic aquifer systems under different hydrogeological conditions may provide new insights about ca isotope signature and fractionation at the datong basin in northern china which is evolved from a fossil lake hydrochemical evolution of its quaternary aquifer system is dominantly controlled by the incongruent dissolution of aluminosilicates which have been well documented in our previous studies using hydrochemical and stable isotope tracers li et al 2016 li et al 2012 xie et al 2014 wang et al 2009 xie et al 2013 therefore we selected datong basin as our case study area for assessing the effects of several hydrogeochemical processes on ca isotope fractionation in silicate aquifers 2 study area the datong basin located in northern china is a nw se oriented cenozoic rifted basin which experienced multiple periods of sedimentary deposition and volcanism since the late pleistocene the four major types of rocks and sediments at datong are li et al 2009 xie et al 2011 fig 1 1 archean metamorphic rocks granites gneiss greenstone terrain in the east margin heng mountain 2 cambrian to ordovician limestone and dolomite with clastic rocks in the southwest margin hongshou mountain 3 carboniferous to permian coal bearing clastic rocks in the northwest margin containing varying amounts of inter bedded sandstone siltstone and shale and 4 late pliocene to holocene basin sediments alluvial and fluvial gravel sand and silt and basalt huanghua uplift most of the datong basin is underlain by alluvial plain pluvial fans and wind blown clastic sediments deposited under arid and semi arid conditions and the thickness of cenozoic sediments ranges from 3500 m to 1500 m from the south to north areas of the datong basin cheng 1983 gu et al 2015 basin scale groundwater flows are mainly from the northwest piedmont to the southeast area and from the basin margin to the central area xie et al 2013 the quaternary groundwater systems in the datong basin can be divided into upper 50 m intermediate 50 160 m and lower 160 m aquifers guo and wang 2004 the upper aquifer host rocks are late pleistocene and holocene inter bedded coarse sand gravel and clay the intermediate aquifer consists of several 2 10 m thickness aquifers separated by local clay units the lower aquifer is made up of early pleistocene and pliocene fine sand and silt the upper aquifer is mainly recharged by vertical infiltration of meteoric water while the laterally penetrating groundwater from the fractured bedrocks along the basin margins is the main recharge source for the intermediate and lower aquifers evapotranspiration and extraction for drinking and irrigation purposes are the two major forms of groundwater discharge in the datong basin the annual average precipitation in the datong basin is between 225 and 400 mm with 75 to 85 of rainfall occurring in july and august annual evaporation is above 2000 mm water table changes from 20 m below the land surface in the margin area to approximately 2 3 m depth in the central area li et al 2016 except for some land of saline soils in the central area most of the soils in the datong basin have been cultivated for centuries two upstream reservoirs and many ditches were built for irrigation in the central part of the basin 3 methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis in august 2013 a total of 26 water samples 24 groundwater and 2 upstream reservoir water samples and 5 rock samples were collected from the datong basin fig 1 all the sampling wells can be mainly divided into two types including multiple screening wells msw and confined screening wells csw the groundwater from msw is the mixture of water from all aquifers screening the well depth while the groundwater from csw is mainly from the lower confined aquifers 16 of 24 groundwater samples were collected from msw type 6 samples were from csw type and the pump information of two groundwater sample was missing table 1 before sampling the wells were purged at least 10 min using a high flow pump when sampling temperature t total dissolved solids tds redox potential orp and ph were monitored in the field using hach instruments portable meters until stable readings all water samples were collected in polyethylene containers using a low flow pump after being filtered through 0 45 μm membranes the samples for cation trace element sr and ca isotope analysis were acidified using ultra purified hno3 to ph 2 and

being filtered the nh4 no2 and hs were measured in the field using hach dr2800 portable spectrophotometer with the detection ranges of 0 02 2 5 mg l 0 002 0 3 mg l and 5 800 µg l respectively water alkalinity was measured using a titration method within 24 h after sampling groundwater doc concentrations were measured using the high temperature catalytic combustion method with a toc analyzer

element concentrations were determined using icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp and icp ms pe elan drc e respectively the saturation indices of minerals and ion activities of water ions were calculated by phreeqc using wateq4f as the database parkhurst and appelo 1999 a 122 m deep borehole no dxz in fig 1 was drilled in the central area of datong basin in october 2010 and a total of 71 sediment samples were collected using capped pvc pipe and stored at 4 c until analysis 5 rock samples were collected from the hongshou mountain at northern and southern margin of datong basin fig 1 a subset of sediment and rock samples was air dried and crushed to pass through 0 125 mm sieves for total organic carbon toc and chemical analysis x ray diffraction xrd patterns were carried out on a germany bruker d8 focus powder diffraction system with cu kα radiation operating at 40 kv and 40 ma the measurement of toc content in sediments was similar to that of groundwater doc above the morphology of

respectively a reproducibility 5 error was obtained on laboratory chemical analysis of major and trace elements charge balance errors for all groundwater samples were below 9 all the chemical measurements above were performed at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences in wuhan 3 2 isotope measurements 13c 12c ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon dic δ13cdic in all water samples were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry thermo fisher scientific mat 253 at the environmental isotope laboratory of the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences in guilin the carbon isotopic compositions are reported in standard δ notation which represents the per mil deviations from the v pdb standard replicate analyses were reproduced within 0 2 1σ wang et al 2014 87sr 86sr and ca isotope signatures of 25 water samples except for one surface water 6 selected sediments and 5 rocks were measured using multi collector thermal ionization mass spectrometry tims at the center for isotope geochemistry university of california berkeley isotope separations for approximately 1 μg sr were performed on ion exchange columns using eichrom sr spec resin 100 ng of separated sr in a solution of 3 n hno3 was loaded with tacl onto a single re filament during the analysis period the composition of the nbs 987 strontium standard was 0 71024 87sr 86sr ratios are reported with 2 s d internal errors although these errors are much smaller than needed for this study the ca carbonate fraction of sediment samples was extracted using 1m acetic acid and dissolved ca concentration in the suspension was determined by tims using isotope dilution measurement spiked by 43ca a total of 30 µg ca for water samples and sediment suspension were spiked with a 42 48ca double spike for ca isotope analysis the spiked aliquots were dried down dissolved in 2 3 drops 2 mol l nitric acid and then loaded onto ca separation column filled with ca specific eichrom dga resin the final ca fraction was eluted in 1 ml di water and dried down these separated and spiked samples were loaded onto re double filaments using 20 phosphoric acid as activator and measured by tims srm 915a was used as the laboratory standard and had an average value of 1 2 0 2 during the measurement period ca isotopic compositions are expressed as δ 44 40ca values relative to the bulk silicate earth value which is 1 0 higher than srm 915a δ 44 40 ca 44 ca 40 ca sample 44 ca 40 ca bse 1 1000 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry hydrochemical compositions and isotope signatures of groundwater from datong basin are shown in table 1 groundwater ph ranged from 7 26 to 8 93 indicating a near neutral to weakly alkaline condition in groundwater system the groundwater tds had a variable range of 365 10150 mg l with a median value of 1143 mg l groundwater na 9 18 1968 mg l and ca 2 86 453 6 mg l were the dominant cations in discharge and recharge areas respectively while groundwater hco3 and cl were the major anions with ranges of 221 2 2123 mg l and 11 46 3301 mg l respectively groundwater doc concentrations ranged from 1 96 to 38 1 mg l with a median value of 4 36 mg l groundwater orp values ranged between 138 4 and 72 5 mv with a median value of 11 mv indicating the prevalence of weakly reducing condition in groundwater approximately 34 of groundwater samples had no detectable no3 0 01 mg l and groundwater nh4 and no2 ranged from 0 02 to 1 10 mg l and from 0 002 to 0 099 mg l respectively the occurrence of nh4 and no2 indicates the occurrence of ammonification and denitrification processes in the groundwater system groundwater hs was detected in several samples with the maximum concentration of 30 µg l under the most reducing condition 138 4 mv 4 2 groundwater isotopic signatures 4 2 1 87sr 86sr ratios the 87sr 86sr values in groundwater ranged from 0 70872 to 0 72155 table 1 a decreasing from the east margin 0 72155 to the central area 0 71046 was observed in the eastern region of study area fig 1 in the west area groundwater 87sr 86sr values had a range of 0 70872 0 71151 narrower than that of east area the upstream reservoir water had a 87sr 86sr value of 0 71024 4 2 2 δ13c dic values the range of δ13cdic in the west area is 18 53 9 09 while that in the east area is 12 97 5 59 table 1 the relatively lower δ13cdic in the west area might be related to biodegradation of organic carbon many studies have demonstrated that the water with inorganic carbon deriving from organic sources has more negative δ13cdic values down to 26 schulte et al 2011 by contrast the higher δ13cdic signatures in east area suggests the control of dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals on the carbon source in groundwater since the freshwater δ13ccaco3 ranges from 14 6 to 1 1 clark and fritz 1997 the two reservoir water samples had δ13cdic values of 7 75 and 9 24 respectively table 1 4 2 3 δ 44 40ca values the groundwater δ 44 40ca values in the datong basin had a range from 0 11 to 0 49 lower than that of seawater 0 9 relative to the same standard values table 1 nielsen et al 2012 the two reservoir samples had relatively higher δ 44 40ca values of 0 55 and 0 64 respectively surface water samples from the reservoir had a temperature of 30 c higher than those of groundwater samples 10 35 16 3 c table 1 temperature can influence the saturation state of carbonate minerals and consequently the saturation index of calcite in the two surface water samples were 0 9986 and 1 0421 which are higher than those of groundwater samples 0 3117 1 0138 except for one outlier 1 2699 4 3 sediment geochemistry and isotope signatures the geochemical compositions and isotope signatures of rocks and borehole sediments are shown in table 2 the lithology of the quaternary sediments at the datong basin is characterized by quartz 8 3 40 89 albite 22 12 39 7 illite 4 31 34 22 and chlorite 5 35 20 89 clayey sediment sample is rich in organic carbon with the content of 5 22 wt the carbonate fraction of sediment are characterized by calcite 0 37 7 22 and dolomite 0 01 2 49 borehole sediment 87sr 86sr ratios ranged from 0 71107 to 0 71612 and the lower isotope ratios are mainly observed in the sediment rich in organic carbon and carbonate minerals the sediment δ 44 40ca values had a range from 0 62 to 0 05 the sediments with higher cao contents generally had relatively higher δ 44 40ca values 4 4 rock geochemistry and isotope signatures for the rock samples an ordovician limestone sample collected from the bedrock of the west margin had a δ 44 40ca value of 0 41 falling near the mean value for carbonate summarized by fantle and tipper 2014 relative to the same reference the sandstone two samples shale and siltstone samples had ca isotope signatures of 0 32 0 66 0 02 and 0 19 respectively which fall within the isotope range of silicates 0 60 0 80 average value 0 06 fantle and tipper 2014 the ordovician limestone had an 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 70979 while the sandstone shale and siltstone had the 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 72358 0 74094 and 0 73558 the contents of kaolinite in rock samples resulted from chemical weathering of aluminosilicates ranged from 27 15 to 88 57 the positive correlation between kaolinite contents and δ 44 40ca value indicates that chemical weathering might favor the enrichment of 44ca in rocks 5 discussion 5 1 hydrochemical evolution the basin scale sr isotope signature of groundwater depends on the type of minerals and sr concentrations in the aquifer matrix in the west area relatively narrower range 0 70872 0 71151 of groundwater 87sr 86sr ratio indicates the contribution from ordovician limestone weathering 0 70979 of hongshou mountain fig 1 comparably the wide range of groundwater 87sr 86sr ratio in the east area indicates the dominant effect of hydrolysis of metamorphic rocks on groundwater chemistry hagedorn and whittier 2015 shand et al 2009 wang et al 2009 along the groundwater flowpath from heng mountain to central area the groundwater chemistry evolves from ca hco3 to na hco3 na cl types table 1 the co occurrence of 87sr 86sr decrease and hydrochemical evolution along groundwater flowpath can be interpreted as a result of water sediment interaction xie et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 a 89 of groundwater samples fall below the 1 1 line of ca mg hco3 so4 suggesting that the groundwater chemistry is largely controlled by silicate weathering which introduce bicarbonate into groundwater in addition several groundwater samples aligned around the halite flushing line with cl br molar ratios higher than 2000 in fig 2b indicate the effects of salt halite from surface soil on shallow groundwater the co elevation of groundwater cl and cl br molar ratios indicates the combined effects of halite introduction and evapotranspiration on groundwater chemistry as a result hydrochemistry of shallow groundwater in the central area is shifted to na cl type which is observed in groundwater sample dt13 15 dt13 20 and dt13 27 with higher tds concentrations table 1 the hydrochemical evolution along groundwater flowpath from heng mountain to central area was further evaluated by inverse modeling using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 to avoid the effect of salt introduction the groundwater sample dt13 04 with well depth of 75 m was selected as the final solution modeling results indicate that along the groundwater flowpath from mountain to central area the hydrochemical processes of datong basin experienced in the east area include cation exchange between cax2 mgx2 and nax precipitation of carbonate minerals negative mass transfer of calcite and dolomite chemical weathering of silicate minerals positive mass transfer of illite kaolinite and quartz little introduction of evaporites positive mass transfer of halite and co2 dissolution table 3 5 2 groundwater ca cycling and its isotope fractionation along the groundwater flowpath groundwater ca decreases from 68 2 to 3 3 mg l fig 3 a as discussed above several hydrochemical processes affect groundwater ca cycling including hydrolysis of metamorphic minerals mixing of different groundwater sources cation exchange on the surface of clay minerals and dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals 5 2 1 hydrolysis of silicate minerals in the east margin the groundwater is mainly recharged by the lateral infiltration of water in bedrock fractures of heng mountain and therefore the groundwater chemistry would be comparable with that in the metamorphic complex which is supported by the similarity in hydrochemistry between sample dt13 01 from the east margin and the spring sample dt 182 from heng mountain table 1 the ca hco3 type water rich in potassium of groundwater dt13 01 mainly originates from the hydrolysis of ca k bearing metamorphic minerals such as anorthite and orthoclase ca al 2 si 2 o 8 3 h 2 o 2 c o 2 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 ca 2 2 hco 3 2 kal si 3 o 8 2 co 2 7 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 k 2 hco 3 4 h 2 sio 3 as a result the clay mineral kaolinite is formed which is the dominant type of clay mineral in bedrock table 2 and the concentration of groundwater hco3 increase along groundwater flowpath fig 3b the chemistry of water infiltrating from the silicate bedrock with little carbonate fraction generally has higher 87sr 86sr ratios jacobson and blum 2000 which is consistent with the groundwater sample dt13 01 with the highest 87sr 86sr ratio table 1 the congruent dissolution of ca bearing plagioclase is unlikely to induce ca isotope fractionation hindshaw et al 2013 ryu et al 2011 it explains the relatively depleted δ 44 40ca values of groundwater sample dt13 01 from the east margin 5 2 2 mixing processes due to the prevalence of irrigate practice using reservoir water in the central area the vertical mixing process can introduce surface water into shallow groundwater system with the depth 30 m and the contribution of reservoir water to shallow groundwater approximately varies from 29 to 93 depending on well depth li et al 2016 the introduction of 44ca enriched surface water leads to the elevation of δ 44 40ca value of shallow groundwater as a result the higher values of δ 44 40ca are mainly observed in the shallow groundwater fig 4 assuming that 30 90 of shallow groundwater was recharged by reservoir water which had the δ 44 40ca value of 0 595 the mean value of two reservoir water and the groundwater sample dt13 04 from central area with well depth of 75 m acts as the groundwater end member the calculated result of two end member model shows that the mixed water sample between groundwater and surface water will have the δ 44 40ca range from 0 305 to 0 554 the δ 44 40ca ratios of four shallow groundwater samples fall into the mixing range indicating that the vertical introduction of surface water leads to the elevation of their δ 44 40ca ratios fig 4 5 2 3 cation exchange along groundwater flowpath from heng mountain to central area of datong basin two hydrochemical processes lead to the elevation of groundwater hco3 including the hydrolysis of silicate minerals and co2 dissolution resulted from biodegradation of organic carbon as a result the groundwater samples with higher doc concentrations 5 mg l from the central area of datong basin generally had higher hco3 concentrations 571 1305 mg l with one outlier 2123 mg l in comparison with those of groundwater with doc 5 mg l hco3 range 221 1014 mg l for the groundwater samples with doc concentration higher than 5 mg l a good correlation was observed between groundwater δ 44 40ca and saturation indices of calcite and dolomite while no correlation was observed for the groundwater with doc 5 mg l fig 3c it indicates that the dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals is not the dominant hydrochemical process controlling the ca fractionation for the groundwater samples with doc 5 mg l however their δ 44 40ca values increase with the decrease in groundwater 87sr 86sr ratio fig 3d suggesting that the water rock interaction along groundwater flowpath involving the groundwater ca might be the main factor controlling the fractionation of groundwater ca isotope the results of inverse modeling in table 3 indicate the occurrence of cation exchange between nax and cax2 mgx2 along groundwater flowpath during cation exchange na sites on clay minerals are substituted by groundwater ca resulting in the increase of na concentration and decrease of ca concentration in groundwater which potentially causes the fractionation of groundwater ca isotope assuming that the cation exchange on clay mineral is responsible for the fractionation of ca isotope in these groundwater samples its fractionation factor was evaluated using rayleigh type fractionation as follows 4 1 δ 44 40 ca δ 44 40 ca 0 1000 α 1 inf where δ 44 40ca is the predicted ca isotope ratio in groundwater δ 44 40ca0 is the starting isotopic composition of groundwater α is the fractionation factor and f the fraction of ca remaining in solution the groundwater sample dt13 01 from the heng mountain had a depleted δ 44 40ca signature derived from silicate hydrolysis which is considered as the starting point δ 44 40ca0 consequently the α values 0 99992 0 99998 fitted in the variation of groundwater ca isotope were shown in fig 3e which are closer to unity than the experimentally determined α values for the cation exchange between nh4 and ca 0 99936 0 99979 ockert et al 2013 5 2 4 the precipitation dissolution of calcite and dolomite the saturation indices of calcite and dolomite calculated by phreeqc yield positive values for all groundwater samples suggesting that the groundwater from the datong basin is oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite table 1 parkhurst and appelo 1999 the negative mass transfer of calcite and dolomite in the inverse model of phreeqc indicates the occurrence of precipitation of calcite dolomite along the groundwater flowpath in the east area table 3 the xrd results of sediment samples shown in table 2 indicate that calcite is the main ca carbonate mineral with little dolomite the groundwater system rich in organic matter in central area of datong basin potentially promotes the formation of microcrystalline dolomite which is supported by the sem eds results shown in fig 5 the organic carbon content of sediment dxz 06 can be up to 5 22 wt table 2 the abundance of sedimentary organic matter which allows for extensive alkalinity generation via subsurface microbial heterotrophy leads to the precipitation of ogranogenic dolomite petrash et al 2017 it is interesting to note that for the groundwater sample rich in organic carbon doc 5 mg l their δ 44 40ca signatures are positively correlated with saturation indices of calcite dolomite fig 3c suggesting that the precipitation of calcite and dolomite driven by biodegradation of organic matter may be responsible for groundwater ca isotope fractionation in these groundwater samples from central area of datong basin generally carbonate precipitation preferentially removes light ca isotopes and leaves heavier ca in the residual solution jacobson and holmden 2008 the degree of ca isotope fractionation during carbonates precipitated from aqueous solution is dependent on precipitation rate r of carbonate minerals depaolo 2011 gussone et al 2005 nielsen et al 2012 tang et al 2008 the higher r value of carbonate precipitation leads to higher absolute 44 40ca fractionation due to the preferential incorporation of light ca at the crystal surface at greater r tang et al 2008 therefore the faster precipitation of calcite and dolomite related to higher si values causes larger fractionation of ca isotope thereby elevating the groundwater δ 44 40ca values fig 3c the groundwater from the west area had a δ 44 40ca range from 0 11 to 0 24 one outlier 0 39 affected by reservoir water which is lower than that of groundwater from east area 0 06 0 27 table 1 and fig 3f it might be related to sedimentary of ordovician limestone in the east area fig 1 which is also reflected by the differences of groundwater δ13cdic signatures between west are and east area a relatively higher range of groundwater δ13cdic 9 7 5 59 were observed in the west area in comparison with those of groundwater samples from the east area 16 93 9 09 table 1 and fig 3f the weathering of ordovician limestone using the co2 as the active species leads to the carbon fractionation between co2 and solid carbonate producing the porewater δ13cdic approaching 6 which closes to the δ13cdic signature 5 59 of groundwater sample dt13 09 walter et al 2007 meanwhile the groundwater sample dt13 09 had the lowest δ 44 40ca ratio 0 11 suggesting that the weathering of ordovician limestone might be responsible for depleted ca isotope signature in groundwater and the isotope fractionation between ordovician limestone and groundwater sample dt13 09 is 0 3 which is comparable to the ca isotope fractionation reported by tang et al 2008 along groundwater flowing from hongshou mountain to central area similar to hydrochemical evolution of east area microbial motivated precipitation of inorganic calcite dolomite and cation exchange between cax2 and nax are expected to elevate the groundwater δ 44 40ca and decrease the groundwater δ13cdic fig 3f 5 3 implications in the silicate dominated groundwater system of datong basin the fractionation of groundwater ca isotope can be affected by several processes including the chemical weathering of aluminosilicates and ordovician limestone conservative mixing cation exchange between nax and cax2 and carbonate precipitation the weathering of aluminosilicate and ordovician limestone from east area and west area result in different ca isotope signatures in groundwater in two areas along the groundwater flowpath shallow groundwater can be affected by infiltration of irrigation water resulting in the elevation of δ 44 40ca values in the shallow parts of the aquifer exchange between cax2 and nax on illite can also contribute to shifting groundwater δ 44 40ca to higher values and the isotope fractionation between clay mineral and groundwater 44 40caclay groundwater cation exchange δ 44 40cadxz 06 0 36 δ 44 40cadt13 03 0 18 is estimated to be 0 54 fig 3d comparably the cation exchange between ca and na reported in madison aquifer carbonate setting south dakata jacobson and holmden 2008 was estimated to cause approximately δ44 40caion 1 0 shift the groundwater environment rich in organic matter in the central area of datong basin favors the occurrence of dolomite and calcite precipitation via the elevation of groundwater hco3 concentration there is some preferential precipitation of light ca isotopes on solid phase thereby resulting in increasing 44ca in groundwater and the fractionation process eventually dependent on precipitation rate which is related to the biodegradation of organic matter arndt et al 2013 generally three main factors are considered to control the degradation rate of organic matter including the substrate the terminal electron acceptors tea and the microbial community a series of hydrolysis and ferment reactions can decompose high molecular weight organic matter into labile and smaller molecules such as acetate and hydrogen thereby facilitating consumption by organisms in groundwater system bethke et al 2011 dale et al 2008 hiemstra et al 2010 karlsson and persson 2010 the organic matter degradation by heterotrophic organisms is thermodynamically coupled to the sequential tea o2 no3 mn vi fe iii and so4 which are all available at the datong basin rivett et al 2008 as a consequence elevated concentrations of groundwater nh4 were observed in several groundwater samples table 1 through either autotrophic or heterotrophic pathways the microbial activities can shift the solution stoichiometry between solution ca and carbonate which has been recognized as an important factor controlling the growth rate of calcite wolthers et al 2012 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of groundwater toc concentrations the ion activities ratios of ca hco3 in groundwater decreases probably due to increasingly oversaturated state of groundwater respect to calcite and consequent calcite precipitation calcite precipitation resulting from organic matter oxidation in groundwater has been observed previously and has been shown to cause decreasing ca relative to dic and shifts in ca isotopes in groundwater for example druhan et al 2013 describe a remediation experiment in which additional organic carbon was injected into groundwater and caused a dramatic decrease of the ca co3 ion activity ratio due to the bio precipitation of calcite and concomitant enrichment of heavier ca isotopes in groundwater in addition to calcite precipitation gypsum precipitation can be caused by sulfur oxidizing bacteria which also results in increased δ 44 40ca values in the remaining aqueous ca harouaka et al 2016 therefore more detailed investigations are needed to assess the bio precipitation effect on ca isotope fractionation 6 conclusions the characteristics of hydrochemical and stable isotopes 87sr 86sr 13cdic and 44 40ca compositions were investigated in groundwater sediment and rock samples collected from the silicate and oc rich groundwater system of the datong basin northern china the hydrochemical type of groundwater evolves from ca hco3 to na hco3 and na cl from the recharge to discharge area groundwater samples have 87sr 86sr δ13cdic and δ 44 40ca ranges of 0 70872 0 72155 18 5 5 6 and 0 11 0 49 respectively the hydrogeochemical processes that affect groundwater ca along flowpaths include aluminosilicate hydrolysis cation exchange between cax2 and nax on clay minerals mixing between infiltrating surface water and groundwater and carbonate precipitation driven by microbial activity all groundwater samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite which are the major carbonate mineral in the host sediments weathering of bedrock aluminosilicates may set the initial ca isotope character in the recharge areas calcite precipitation is important because bio degradation of organic matter

7401,to understand the characteristics of ca isotope composition and fractionation in silicate dominated quaternary aquifer system hydrochemical and isotope studies 87sr 86sr 13cdic and 44 40ca were conducted on groundwater sediment and rock samples from the datong basin china along the groundwater flow path from the basin margin to the center groundwater hydrochemical type evolves from ca hco3 to na hco3 na cl type which results from aluminosilicate hydrolysis vertical mixing cation exchange between cax2 and nax and calcite dolomite precipitation these processes cause the decrease in groundwater ca concentration and the associated modest fractionation of groundwater ca isotopes along the flowpath the groundwater δ 44 40ca value varies from 0 11 to 0 49 the elevated δ 44 40ca ratios in shallow groundwater are attributed to vertical mixing involving addition of irrigation water which had the average δ 44 40ca ratio of 0 595 chemical weathering of silicate minerals and carbonate generates depleted δ 44 40ca signatures in groundwater from heng mountain east area and huanghua uplift west area respectively along the groundwater flow path from heng mountain to central area of east area cation exchange between cax2 and nax on clay mineral results in the enrichment of heavier ca isotope in groundwater all groundwater samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite the groundwater environment rich in organic matter promotes the precipitation of carbonate minerals via the biodegradation of organic carbon thereby further promoting the elevation of groundwater δ 44 40ca ratios keywords silicate system calcium isotope fractionation groundwater 1 introduction recent advances in geochemical studies of stable isotopes such as sr and ca in groundwater have substantially improved our understanding of water rock interactions and solute transport processes i g cartwright et al 2010 gosselin et al 2004 zhu and macdougall 1998 calcium is one of the more abundant metal elements in the earth s crust and understanding the effects of various physical and chemical processes on its isotope fractionation could provide new perspectives on the evolution of many natural systems ca isotope variation and fractionation have been inferred to be due to secondary precipitation of ca bearing phases hindshaw et al 2013 source mixing processes jacobson et al 2015 ion exchange ockert et al 2013 biological processes böhm et al 2006 and plant uptake bagard et al 2013 generally inorganic calcite grown at moderate solution oversaturation preferentially excludes 44ca and the degree of 40ca enrichment is dependent on precipitation rate and solution temperature tang et al 2008 since the elemental role played by ca in the lithosphere biosphere and hydrosphere the understanding the mechanism of ca isotope fractionation helps to develop the ca isotope as a potential tracer in the oceanic setting ca sedimentation is considered to be a critical recorder of ocean evolution and therefore ca isotope is helpful to reconstruct the fluctuation of ocean ca concentration through geologic time griffith et al 2008 the variations of ca isotope of marine carbonate also provide information on the weathering and or depositional mode within the ocean fantle 2010 additionally the ca isotopes have been proposed as a proxy for the global carbon cycle and paleo sea surface temperatures griffith et al 2008 nägler et al 2000 compared to studies on ca isotope fractionation in carbonate dominated settings little work has been conducted on ca cycling and isotope fractionation in silicate systems jacobson et al 2015 moore et al 2013 silicate rocks and minerals have a somewhat larger range of δ 44 40ca than carbonate rocks fantle and tipper 2014 therefore it is not surprising that water in silicate systems would exhibit different ca isotope signatures from those in carbonate systems up to now the ca isotope signatures of groundwater in silicate aquifers have not been systematically evaluated therefore theoretical and case studies on silicate dominated cenozoic aquifer systems under different hydrogeological conditions may provide new insights about ca isotope signature and fractionation at the datong basin in northern china which is evolved from a fossil lake hydrochemical evolution of its quaternary aquifer system is dominantly controlled by the incongruent dissolution of aluminosilicates which have been well documented in our previous studies using hydrochemical and stable isotope tracers li et al 2016 li et al 2012 xie et al 2014 wang et al 2009 xie et al 2013 therefore we selected datong basin as our case study area for assessing the effects of several hydrogeochemical processes on ca isotope fractionation in silicate aquifers 2 study area the datong basin located in northern china is a nw se oriented cenozoic rifted basin which experienced multiple periods of sedimentary deposition and volcanism since the late pleistocene the four major types of rocks and sediments at datong are li et al 2009 xie et al 2011 fig 1 1 archean metamorphic rocks granites gneiss greenstone terrain in the east margin heng mountain 2 cambrian to ordovician limestone and dolomite with clastic rocks in the southwest margin hongshou mountain 3 carboniferous to permian coal bearing clastic rocks in the northwest margin containing varying amounts of inter bedded sandstone siltstone and shale and 4 late pliocene to holocene basin sediments alluvial and fluvial gravel sand and silt and basalt huanghua uplift most of the datong basin is underlain by alluvial plain pluvial fans and wind blown clastic sediments deposited under arid and semi arid conditions and the thickness of cenozoic sediments ranges from 3500 m to 1500 m from the south to north areas of the datong basin cheng 1983 gu et al 2015 basin scale groundwater flows are mainly from the northwest piedmont to the southeast area and from the basin margin to the central area xie et al 2013 the quaternary groundwater systems in the datong basin can be divided into upper 50 m intermediate 50 160 m and lower 160 m aquifers guo and wang 2004 the upper aquifer host rocks are late pleistocene and holocene inter bedded coarse sand gravel and clay the intermediate aquifer consists of several 2 10 m thickness aquifers separated by local clay units the lower aquifer is made up of early pleistocene and pliocene fine sand and silt the upper aquifer is mainly recharged by vertical infiltration of meteoric water while the laterally penetrating groundwater from the fractured bedrocks along the basin margins is the main recharge source for the intermediate and lower aquifers evapotranspiration and extraction for drinking and irrigation purposes are the two major forms of groundwater discharge in the datong basin the annual average precipitation in the datong basin is between 225 and 400 mm with 75 to 85 of rainfall occurring in july and august annual evaporation is above 2000 mm water table changes from 20 m below the land surface in the margin area to approximately 2 3 m depth in the central area li et al 2016 except for some land of saline soils in the central area most of the soils in the datong basin have been cultivated for centuries two upstream reservoirs and many ditches were built for irrigation in the central part of the basin 3 methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis in august 2013 a total of 26 water samples 24 groundwater and 2 upstream reservoir water samples and 5 rock samples were collected from the datong basin fig 1 all the sampling wells can be mainly divided into two types including multiple screening wells msw and confined screening wells csw the groundwater from msw is the mixture of water from all aquifers screening the well depth while the groundwater from csw is mainly from the lower confined aquifers 16 of 24 groundwater samples were collected from msw type 6 samples were from csw type and the pump information of two groundwater sample was missing table 1 before sampling the wells were purged at least 10 min using a high flow pump when sampling temperature t total dissolved solids tds redox potential orp and ph were monitored in the field using hach instruments portable meters until stable readings all water samples were collected in polyethylene containers using a low flow pump after being filtered through 0 45 μm membranes the samples for cation trace element sr and ca isotope analysis were acidified using ultra purified hno3 to ph 2 and samples for anion cdic isotope and ca isotope analysis were collected without acidification the one for groundwater dissolved organic carbon doc analysis was collected in the brown glass sampler after being filtered the nh4 no2 and hs were measured in the field using hach dr2800 portable spectrophotometer with the detection ranges of 0 02 2 5 mg l 0 002 0 3 mg l and 5 800 µg l respectively water alkalinity was measured using a titration method within 24 h after sampling groundwater doc concentrations were measured using the high temperature catalytic combustion method with a toc analyzer multi n c 300 toc analytik jena ag after using 2m hcl to remove the inorganic carbon in groundwater anion concentrations were measured using ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact cation and trace element concentrations were determined using icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp and icp ms pe elan drc e respectively the saturation indices of minerals and ion activities of water ions were calculated by phreeqc using wateq4f as the database parkhurst and appelo 1999 a 122 m deep borehole no dxz in fig 1 was drilled in the central area of datong basin in october 2010 and a total of 71 sediment samples were collected using capped pvc pipe and stored at 4 c until analysis 5 rock samples were collected from the hongshou mountain at northern and southern margin of datong basin fig 1 a subset of sediment and rock samples was air dried and crushed to pass through 0 125 mm sieves for total organic carbon toc and chemical analysis x ray diffraction xrd patterns were carried out on a germany bruker d8 focus powder diffraction system with cu kα radiation operating at 40 kv and 40 ma the measurement of toc content in sediments was similar to that of groundwater doc above the morphology of sediment sample was observed and determined using an ultra high resolution environmental scanning electron microscope esem hitachi su8010 and x ray energy dispersive system eds ametek edaxappollo xp respectively a reproducibility 5 error was obtained on laboratory chemical analysis of major and trace elements charge balance errors for all groundwater samples were below 9 all the chemical measurements above were performed at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences in wuhan 3 2 isotope measurements 13c 12c ratios of dissolved inorganic carbon dic δ13cdic in all water samples were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry thermo fisher scientific mat 253 at the environmental isotope laboratory of the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences in guilin the carbon isotopic compositions are reported in standard δ notation which represents the per mil deviations from the v pdb standard replicate analyses were reproduced within 0 2 1σ wang et al 2014 87sr 86sr and ca isotope signatures of 25 water samples except for one surface water 6 selected sediments and 5 rocks were measured using multi collector thermal ionization mass spectrometry tims at the center for isotope geochemistry university of california berkeley isotope separations for approximately 1 μg sr were performed on ion exchange columns using eichrom sr spec resin 100 ng of separated sr in a solution of 3 n hno3 was loaded with tacl onto a single re filament during the analysis period the composition of the nbs 987 strontium standard was 0 71024 87sr 86sr ratios are reported with 2 s d internal errors although these errors are much smaller than needed for this study the ca carbonate fraction of sediment samples was extracted using 1m acetic acid and dissolved ca concentration in the suspension was determined by tims using isotope dilution measurement spiked by 43ca a total of 30 µg ca for water samples and sediment suspension were spiked with a 42 48ca double spike for ca isotope analysis the spiked aliquots were dried down dissolved in 2 3 drops 2 mol l nitric acid and then loaded onto ca separation column filled with ca specific eichrom dga resin the final ca fraction was eluted in 1 ml di water and dried down these separated and spiked samples were loaded onto re double filaments using 20 phosphoric acid as activator and measured by tims srm 915a was used as the laboratory standard and had an average value of 1 2 0 2 during the measurement period ca isotopic compositions are expressed as δ 44 40ca values relative to the bulk silicate earth value which is 1 0 higher than srm 915a δ 44 40 ca 44 ca 40 ca sample 44 ca 40 ca bse 1 1000 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry hydrochemical compositions and isotope signatures of groundwater from datong basin are shown in table 1 groundwater ph ranged from 7 26 to 8 93 indicating a near neutral to weakly alkaline condition in groundwater system the groundwater tds had a variable range of 365 10150 mg l with a median value of 1143 mg l groundwater na 9 18 1968 mg l and ca 2 86 453 6 mg l were the dominant cations in discharge and recharge areas respectively while groundwater hco3 and cl were the major anions with ranges of 221 2 2123 mg l and 11 46 3301 mg l respectively groundwater doc concentrations ranged from 1 96 to 38 1 mg l with a median value of 4 36 mg l groundwater orp values ranged between 138 4 and 72 5 mv with a median value of 11 mv indicating the prevalence of weakly reducing condition in groundwater approximately 34 of groundwater samples had no detectable no3 0 01 mg l and groundwater nh4 and no2 ranged from 0 02 to 1 10 mg l and from 0 002 to 0 099 mg l respectively the occurrence of nh4 and no2 indicates the occurrence of ammonification and denitrification processes in the groundwater system groundwater hs was detected in several samples with the maximum concentration of 30 µg l under the most reducing condition 138 4 mv 4 2 groundwater isotopic signatures 4 2 1 87sr 86sr ratios the 87sr 86sr values in groundwater ranged from 0 70872 to 0 72155 table 1 a decreasing from the east margin 0 72155 to the central area 0 71046 was observed in the eastern region of study area fig 1 in the west area groundwater 87sr 86sr values had a range of 0 70872 0 71151 narrower than that of east area the upstream reservoir water had a 87sr 86sr value of 0 71024 4 2 2 δ13c dic values the range of δ13cdic in the west area is 18 53 9 09 while that in the east area is 12 97 5 59 table 1 the relatively lower δ13cdic in the west area might be related to biodegradation of organic carbon many studies have demonstrated that the water with inorganic carbon deriving from organic sources has more negative δ13cdic values down to 26 schulte et al 2011 by contrast the higher δ13cdic signatures in east area suggests the control of dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals on the carbon source in groundwater since the freshwater δ13ccaco3 ranges from 14 6 to 1 1 clark and fritz 1997 the two reservoir water samples had δ13cdic values of 7 75 and 9 24 respectively table 1 4 2 3 δ 44 40ca values the groundwater δ 44 40ca values in the datong basin had a range from 0 11 to 0 49 lower than that of seawater 0 9 relative to the same standard values table 1 nielsen et al 2012 the two reservoir samples had relatively higher δ 44 40ca values of 0 55 and 0 64 respectively surface water samples from the reservoir had a temperature of 30 c higher than those of groundwater samples 10 35 16 3 c table 1 temperature can influence the saturation state of carbonate minerals and consequently the saturation index of calcite in the two surface water samples were 0 9986 and 1 0421 which are higher than those of groundwater samples 0 3117 1 0138 except for one outlier 1 2699 4 3 sediment geochemistry and isotope signatures the geochemical compositions and isotope signatures of rocks and borehole sediments are shown in table 2 the lithology of the quaternary sediments at the datong basin is characterized by quartz 8 3 40 89 albite 22 12 39 7 illite 4 31 34 22 and chlorite 5 35 20 89 clayey sediment sample is rich in organic carbon with the content of 5 22 wt the carbonate fraction of sediment are characterized by calcite 0 37 7 22 and dolomite 0 01 2 49 borehole sediment 87sr 86sr ratios ranged from 0 71107 to 0 71612 and the lower isotope ratios are mainly observed in the sediment rich in organic carbon and carbonate minerals the sediment δ 44 40ca values had a range from 0 62 to 0 05 the sediments with higher cao contents generally had relatively higher δ 44 40ca values 4 4 rock geochemistry and isotope signatures for the rock samples an ordovician limestone sample collected from the bedrock of the west margin had a δ 44 40ca value of 0 41 falling near the mean value for carbonate summarized by fantle and tipper 2014 relative to the same reference the sandstone two samples shale and siltstone samples had ca isotope signatures of 0 32 0 66 0 02 and 0 19 respectively which fall within the isotope range of silicates 0 60 0 80 average value 0 06 fantle and tipper 2014 the ordovician limestone had an 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 70979 while the sandstone shale and siltstone had the 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 72358 0 74094 and 0 73558 the contents of kaolinite in rock samples resulted from chemical weathering of aluminosilicates ranged from 27 15 to 88 57 the positive correlation between kaolinite contents and δ 44 40ca value indicates that chemical weathering might favor the enrichment of 44ca in rocks 5 discussion 5 1 hydrochemical evolution the basin scale sr isotope signature of groundwater depends on the type of minerals and sr concentrations in the aquifer matrix in the west area relatively narrower range 0 70872 0 71151 of groundwater 87sr 86sr ratio indicates the contribution from ordovician limestone weathering 0 70979 of hongshou mountain fig 1 comparably the wide range of groundwater 87sr 86sr ratio in the east area indicates the dominant effect of hydrolysis of metamorphic rocks on groundwater chemistry hagedorn and whittier 2015 shand et al 2009 wang et al 2009 along the groundwater flowpath from heng mountain to central area the groundwater chemistry evolves from ca hco3 to na hco3 na cl types table 1 the co occurrence of 87sr 86sr decrease and hydrochemical evolution along groundwater flowpath can be interpreted as a result of water sediment interaction xie et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 a 89 of groundwater samples fall below the 1 1 line of ca mg hco3 so4 suggesting that the groundwater chemistry is largely controlled by silicate weathering which introduce bicarbonate into groundwater in addition several groundwater samples aligned around the halite flushing line with cl br molar ratios higher than 2000 in fig 2b indicate the effects of salt halite from surface soil on shallow groundwater the co elevation of groundwater cl and cl br molar ratios indicates the combined effects of halite introduction and evapotranspiration on groundwater chemistry as a result hydrochemistry of shallow groundwater in the central area is shifted to na cl type which is observed in groundwater sample dt13 15 dt13 20 and dt13 27 with higher tds concentrations table 1 the hydrochemical evolution along groundwater flowpath from heng mountain to central area was further evaluated by inverse modeling using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 to avoid the effect of salt introduction the groundwater sample dt13 04 with well depth of 75 m was selected as the final solution modeling results indicate that along the groundwater flowpath from mountain to central area the hydrochemical processes of datong basin experienced in the east area include cation exchange between cax2 mgx2 and nax precipitation of carbonate minerals negative mass transfer of calcite and dolomite chemical weathering of silicate minerals positive mass transfer of illite kaolinite and quartz little introduction of evaporites positive mass transfer of halite and co2 dissolution table 3 5 2 groundwater ca cycling and its isotope fractionation along the groundwater flowpath groundwater ca decreases from 68 2 to 3 3 mg l fig 3 a as discussed above several hydrochemical processes affect groundwater ca cycling including hydrolysis of metamorphic minerals mixing of different groundwater sources cation exchange on the surface of clay minerals and dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals 5 2 1 hydrolysis of silicate minerals in the east margin the groundwater is mainly recharged by the lateral infiltration of water in bedrock fractures of heng mountain and therefore the groundwater chemistry would be comparable with that in the metamorphic complex which is supported by the similarity in hydrochemistry between sample dt13 01 from the east margin and the spring sample dt 182 from heng mountain table 1 the ca hco3 type water rich in potassium of groundwater dt13 01 mainly originates from the hydrolysis of ca k bearing metamorphic minerals such as anorthite and orthoclase ca al 2 si 2 o 8 3 h 2 o 2 c o 2 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 ca 2 2 hco 3 2 kal si 3 o 8 2 co 2 7 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2 k 2 hco 3 4 h 2 sio 3 as a result the clay mineral kaolinite is formed which is the dominant type of clay mineral in bedrock table 2 and the concentration of groundwater hco3 increase along groundwater flowpath fig 3b the chemistry of water infiltrating from the silicate bedrock with little carbonate fraction generally has higher 87sr 86sr ratios jacobson and blum 2000 which is consistent with the groundwater sample dt13 01 with the highest 87sr 86sr ratio table 1 the congruent dissolution of ca bearing plagioclase is unlikely to induce ca isotope fractionation hindshaw et al 2013 ryu et al 2011 it explains the relatively depleted δ 44 40ca values of groundwater sample dt13 01 from the east margin 5 2 2 mixing processes due to the prevalence of irrigate practice using reservoir water in the central area the vertical mixing process can introduce surface water into shallow groundwater system with the depth 30 m and the contribution of reservoir water to shallow groundwater approximately varies from 29 to 93 depending on well depth li et al 2016 the introduction of 44ca enriched surface water leads to the elevation of δ 44 40ca value of shallow groundwater as a result the higher values of δ 44 40ca are mainly observed in the shallow groundwater fig 4 assuming that 30 90 of shallow groundwater was recharged by reservoir water which had the δ 44 40ca value of 0 595 the mean value of two reservoir water and the groundwater sample dt13 04 from central area with well depth of 75 m acts as the groundwater end member the calculated result of two end member model shows that the mixed water sample between groundwater and surface water will have the δ 44 40ca range from 0 305 to 0 554 the δ 44 40ca ratios of four shallow groundwater samples fall into the mixing range indicating that the vertical introduction of surface water leads to the elevation of their δ 44 40ca ratios fig 4 5 2 3 cation exchange along groundwater flowpath from heng mountain to central area of datong basin two hydrochemical processes lead to the elevation of groundwater hco3 including the hydrolysis of silicate minerals and co2 dissolution resulted from biodegradation of organic carbon as a result the groundwater samples with higher doc concentrations 5 mg l from the central area of datong basin generally had higher hco3 concentrations 571 1305 mg l with one outlier 2123 mg l in comparison with those of groundwater with doc 5 mg l hco3 range 221 1014 mg l for the groundwater samples with doc concentration higher than 5 mg l a good correlation was observed between groundwater δ 44 40ca and saturation indices of calcite and dolomite while no correlation was observed for the groundwater with doc 5 mg l fig 3c it indicates that the dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals is not the dominant hydrochemical process controlling the ca fractionation for the groundwater samples with doc 5 mg l however their δ 44 40ca values increase with the decrease in groundwater 87sr 86sr ratio fig 3d suggesting that the water rock interaction along groundwater flowpath involving the groundwater ca might be the main factor controlling the fractionation of groundwater ca isotope the results of inverse modeling in table 3 indicate the occurrence of cation exchange between nax and cax2 mgx2 along groundwater flowpath during cation exchange na sites on clay minerals are substituted by groundwater ca resulting in the increase of na concentration and decrease of ca concentration in groundwater which potentially causes the fractionation of groundwater ca isotope assuming that the cation exchange on clay mineral is responsible for the fractionation of ca isotope in these groundwater samples its fractionation factor was evaluated using rayleigh type fractionation as follows 4 1 δ 44 40 ca δ 44 40 ca 0 1000 α 1 inf where δ 44 40ca is the predicted ca isotope ratio in groundwater δ 44 40ca0 is the starting isotopic composition of groundwater α is the fractionation factor and f the fraction of ca remaining in solution the groundwater sample dt13 01 from the heng mountain had a depleted δ 44 40ca signature derived from silicate hydrolysis which is considered as the starting point δ 44 40ca0 consequently the α values 0 99992 0 99998 fitted in the variation of groundwater ca isotope were shown in fig 3e which are closer to unity than the experimentally determined α values for the cation exchange between nh4 and ca 0 99936 0 99979 ockert et al 2013 5 2 4 the precipitation dissolution of calcite and dolomite the saturation indices of calcite and dolomite calculated by phreeqc yield positive values for all groundwater samples suggesting that the groundwater from the datong basin is oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite table 1 parkhurst and appelo 1999 the negative mass transfer of calcite and dolomite in the inverse model of phreeqc indicates the occurrence of precipitation of calcite dolomite along the groundwater flowpath in the east area table 3 the xrd results of sediment samples shown in table 2 indicate that calcite is the main ca carbonate mineral with little dolomite the groundwater system rich in organic matter in central area of datong basin potentially promotes the formation of microcrystalline dolomite which is supported by the sem eds results shown in fig 5 the organic carbon content of sediment dxz 06 can be up to 5 22 wt table 2 the abundance of sedimentary organic matter which allows for extensive alkalinity generation via subsurface microbial heterotrophy leads to the precipitation of ogranogenic dolomite petrash et al 2017 it is interesting to note that for the groundwater sample rich in organic carbon doc 5 mg l their δ 44 40ca signatures are positively correlated with saturation indices of calcite dolomite fig 3c suggesting that the precipitation of calcite and dolomite driven by biodegradation of organic matter may be responsible for groundwater ca isotope fractionation in these groundwater samples from central area of datong basin generally carbonate precipitation preferentially removes light ca isotopes and leaves heavier ca in the residual solution jacobson and holmden 2008 the degree of ca isotope fractionation during carbonates precipitated from aqueous solution is dependent on precipitation rate r of carbonate minerals depaolo 2011 gussone et al 2005 nielsen et al 2012 tang et al 2008 the higher r value of carbonate precipitation leads to higher absolute 44 40ca fractionation due to the preferential incorporation of light ca at the crystal surface at greater r tang et al 2008 therefore the faster precipitation of calcite and dolomite related to higher si values causes larger fractionation of ca isotope thereby elevating the groundwater δ 44 40ca values fig 3c the groundwater from the west area had a δ 44 40ca range from 0 11 to 0 24 one outlier 0 39 affected by reservoir water which is lower than that of groundwater from east area 0 06 0 27 table 1 and fig 3f it might be related to sedimentary of ordovician limestone in the east area fig 1 which is also reflected by the differences of groundwater δ13cdic signatures between west are and east area a relatively higher range of groundwater δ13cdic 9 7 5 59 were observed in the west area in comparison with those of groundwater samples from the east area 16 93 9 09 table 1 and fig 3f the weathering of ordovician limestone using the co2 as the active species leads to the carbon fractionation between co2 and solid carbonate producing the porewater δ13cdic approaching 6 which closes to the δ13cdic signature 5 59 of groundwater sample dt13 09 walter et al 2007 meanwhile the groundwater sample dt13 09 had the lowest δ 44 40ca ratio 0 11 suggesting that the weathering of ordovician limestone might be responsible for depleted ca isotope signature in groundwater and the isotope fractionation between ordovician limestone and groundwater sample dt13 09 is 0 3 which is comparable to the ca isotope fractionation reported by tang et al 2008 along groundwater flowing from hongshou mountain to central area similar to hydrochemical evolution of east area microbial motivated precipitation of inorganic calcite dolomite and cation exchange between cax2 and nax are expected to elevate the groundwater δ 44 40ca and decrease the groundwater δ13cdic fig 3f 5 3 implications in the silicate dominated groundwater system of datong basin the fractionation of groundwater ca isotope can be affected by several processes including the chemical weathering of aluminosilicates and ordovician limestone conservative mixing cation exchange between nax and cax2 and carbonate precipitation the weathering of aluminosilicate and ordovician limestone from east area and west area result in different ca isotope signatures in groundwater in two areas along the groundwater flowpath shallow groundwater can be affected by infiltration of irrigation water resulting in the elevation of δ 44 40ca values in the shallow parts of the aquifer exchange between cax2 and nax on illite can also contribute to shifting groundwater δ 44 40ca to higher values and the isotope fractionation between clay mineral and groundwater 44 40caclay groundwater cation exchange δ 44 40cadxz 06 0 36 δ 44 40cadt13 03 0 18 is estimated to be 0 54 fig 3d comparably the cation exchange between ca and na reported in madison aquifer carbonate setting south dakata jacobson and holmden 2008 was estimated to cause approximately δ44 40caion 1 0 shift the groundwater environment rich in organic matter in the central area of datong basin favors the occurrence of dolomite and calcite precipitation via the elevation of groundwater hco3 concentration there is some preferential precipitation of light ca isotopes on solid phase thereby resulting in increasing 44ca in groundwater and the fractionation process eventually dependent on precipitation rate which is related to the biodegradation of organic matter arndt et al 2013 generally three main factors are considered to control the degradation rate of organic matter including the substrate the terminal electron acceptors tea and the microbial community a series of hydrolysis and ferment reactions can decompose high molecular weight organic matter into labile and smaller molecules such as acetate and hydrogen thereby facilitating consumption by organisms in groundwater system bethke et al 2011 dale et al 2008 hiemstra et al 2010 karlsson and persson 2010 the organic matter degradation by heterotrophic organisms is thermodynamically coupled to the sequential tea o2 no3 mn vi fe iii and so4 which are all available at the datong basin rivett et al 2008 as a consequence elevated concentrations of groundwater nh4 were observed in several groundwater samples table 1 through either autotrophic or heterotrophic pathways the microbial activities can shift the solution stoichiometry between solution ca and carbonate which has been recognized as an important factor controlling the growth rate of calcite wolthers et al 2012 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of groundwater toc concentrations the ion activities ratios of ca hco3 in groundwater decreases probably due to increasingly oversaturated state of groundwater respect to calcite and consequent calcite precipitation calcite precipitation resulting from organic matter oxidation in groundwater has been observed previously and has been shown to cause decreasing ca relative to dic and shifts in ca isotopes in groundwater for example druhan et al 2013 describe a remediation experiment in which additional organic carbon was injected into groundwater and caused a dramatic decrease of the ca co3 ion activity ratio due to the bio precipitation of calcite and concomitant enrichment of heavier ca isotopes in groundwater in addition to calcite precipitation gypsum precipitation can be caused by sulfur oxidizing bacteria which also results in increased δ 44 40ca values in the remaining aqueous ca harouaka et al 2016 therefore more detailed investigations are needed to assess the bio precipitation effect on ca isotope fractionation 6 conclusions the characteristics of hydrochemical and stable isotopes 87sr 86sr 13cdic and 44 40ca compositions were investigated in groundwater sediment and rock samples collected from the silicate and oc rich groundwater system of the datong basin northern china the hydrochemical type of groundwater evolves from ca hco3 to na hco3 and na cl from the recharge to discharge area groundwater samples have 87sr 86sr δ13cdic and δ 44 40ca ranges of 0 70872 0 72155 18 5 5 6 and 0 11 0 49 respectively the hydrogeochemical processes that affect groundwater ca along flowpaths include aluminosilicate hydrolysis cation exchange between cax2 and nax on clay minerals mixing between infiltrating surface water and groundwater and carbonate precipitation driven by microbial activity all groundwater samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite which are the major carbonate mineral in the host sediments weathering of bedrock aluminosilicates may set the initial ca isotope character in the recharge areas calcite precipitation is important because bio degradation of organic matter generates alkalinity that promotes calcite precipitation acknowledgements we would like to thank thomas l owens of university of california berkeley and lanping feng of state key laboratory of

7402,the canopy storage capacity s is a major component of the surface water balance we analysed the relationship between the tree canopy water storage capacity and leaf wettability under changing simulated rainfall temperature we estimated the effect of the rain temperature change on the canopy storage capacity and contact angle of leave and needle surfaces based on two scenarios six dominant forest trees were analysed english oak quercus roburl common beech fagus sylvatica l small leaved lime tilia cordata mill silver fir abies alba scots pine pinus sylvestris l and norway spruce picea abies l twigs of these species were collected from krynica zdrój that is the experimental forestry unit of the university of agriculture in cracow southern poland experimental analyses simulations of precipitation were performed in a laboratory under controlled conditions the canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability classification were determined at 12 water temperatures and a practical calculator to compute changes of s and contact angles of droplets was developed among all species an increase of the rainfall temperature by 0 7 c decreases the contact angle between leave and needle surfaces by 2 41 and increases the canopy storage capacity by 0 74 g g 1 an increase of the rain temperature by 2 7 c decreases the contact angle by 9 29 and increases the canopy storage capacity by 2 85 g g 1 a decreased contact angle between a water droplet and leaf surface indicates increased wettability thus our results show that an increased temperature increases the leaf wettability in all examined species the comparison of different species implies that the water temperature has the strongest effect on spruce and the weakest effect on oak these data indicate that the rainfall temperature influences the canopy storage capacity keywords crown retention hydrophobicity actual interception water balance contact angle calculator 1 introduction the wettability of the surfaces of broad leaves and needles is a physiological feature related to their morphology season and weather conditions wettability is responsible for the self cleaning lotus effect of hydrophobic leaves of selected species stosch et al 2007 tranquada and erb 2014 and for hydrophilic properties of leaves with hair aryal and neuner 2010 classified the wettability based on the contact angle between droplets and the leaf surface and many other studies used this classification scheme holder 2013 rosaldo and holder 2013 previous studies have indicated that the effect of temperature is important for the water density and the way in which droplets adhere to the leaves owsiak et al 2013 wettability is closely related to hydrological parameters such as the canopy storage capacity s previous hydrological studies considered s to be dependent on the species xiao and mcpherson 2016 leaf morphology herwitz 1985 tranquada and erb 2014 fernández and eicherd 2009 stratification of the tree stand nanko et al 2011 and season neinhuis and barthlott 1997 other studies examined the influence of factors associated with the intensity of precipitation and size of water droplets keim et al 2006 nanko et al 2006 klamerus iwan 2014 additionally several basic research studies hall and calder 1993 xiao and mcpherson 2016 determined the precise relationship between the canopy storage capacity and rainfall intensity to develop physical and empirical models for interception liu 2001 d almeida et al 2006 the canopy storage capacity is related to the water balance of a forest which in turn has large scale microclimatic effects as described by aussenac 2000 the amount of water retained in a tree crown may be considered as loss or delay of water reaching the soil where it is available for uptake the level of the canopy storage capacity affects the circulation of water in the atmosphere verstraeten et al 2005 overdieck and forstreuter 1994 zhang et al 2016 estimated that global evapotranspiration consists of 65 transpiration from vegetation 25 evapotranspiration from soil and 10 vaporization of intercepted rainfall from vegetation using the penman monteith leuning pml model in the intermediate temperate zone deciduous and coniferous tree crowns can retain even more water gash et al 1995 the canopy storage capacity is particularly important in regions with a negative water balance martin and von willert 2000 sadeghi et al 2014 where the amount of water captured by the tree crown has a greater hydrologic significance and in regions in which changes in climate and water conditions can alter the abundance of different forest trees e g beech in poland for example total precipitation duration of time below 0 c and extent of temperature fluctuations during the day affect the beech distribution chojnacka ożga and ożga 2012 the degree of water availability also affects the biodiversity and is therefore an important issue in sustainable forest management the amount of water retained in tree crowns which is unavailable to roots is an important issue that has been addressed at many international union of forest research organizations iufro conferences such changes occur globally serengil et al 2011 any change in the quantity and quality of rainfall is difficult to predict but related to the air temperature wasko and sharma 2017 small and large rain drops do not have a uniform temperature due to the more rapid evaporation of small droplets therefore the difference between the temperature of bulk rain and that of ambient air is not constant during a rainfall event and the rain can be up to several degrees c colder than the ambient air byers et al 1949 abraham 1962 changes in the air temperature thus cause changes in the precipitation temperature rainfall temperature changes may affect the wettability and water availability of forest ecosystems huntington 2006 ryan and vose 2012 mátyás and sun 2014 the global climate is currently warming a trend that is expected to continue and these changes are partly associated with drastic shifts inprecipitation regimes fitzgerald and lindner 2013 ipcc 2014 even in the seasonal changes pattern the temperature of precipitation may affect the amount of water retained in the crown levia and herwitz 2000 reported that the physical properties of water can have significant implications for chemical leaching of trees due to differential contact times with the tree surface thus studies of the effects of the water temperature change must also consider the canopy storage capacity of tree crowns studies are needed to assess the relationship between rainfall temperature changes and the ecohydrological properties of particular species of trees these studies must consider the amount of water that is retained in the crowns in analysis of the overall water balance the general aim of the research presented here was to analyse the relationship between the canopy storage capacity and different classes of leaf wettability and rainfall temperatures and to forecast the effect of rainfall temperature changes on the wettability of leaf and needle surfaces based on two scenarios we tested three specific hypotheses first as the simulated rainfall temperature increases the contact angles of droplets decrease and the wettability of leaf surfaces increases second as the wettability increases the canopy storage capacity increases third an increased water temperature has different effects on the canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability of different species 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling sites the study site is located in krynica zdrój that is the experimental forestry unit of the university of agriculture in cracow southern poland the dominant tree species were silver fir abies alba mill european beech fagus sylvatica l and norway spruce picea abies l the forest cover in this area exceeds 60 of which 41 5 is fir 22 is beech 18 5 is norway spruce and 18 is due to other species the study area has an average annual rainfall of 1000 mm and average annual temperature of 5 3 c the leaves and needles of six common european tree species were collected common oak quercus robur l common beech fagus sylvatica l small leaved lime tilia cordata mill silver fir abies alba scots pine pinus sylvestris l and norway spruce picea abies l leafy twigs were collected with a telescopic snapper due to seasonal changes in the foliage that could affect the wettability and canopy storage capacity of the tree crowns klamerus iwan and błońska 2017 all collections were performed in june and the first week of july of 2015 twenty five leafy twigs were collected from different locations in the crown and protected from drying during transport to the laboratory in plastic containers all measurements were performed immediately after arrival all analyses were performed under constant humidity 48 50 in the laboratory effects of wind air pressure and relative humidity were not taken into account other studies showed that the air temperature atmospheric humidity and radiation affect the water density and adhesion of droplets to leaves willett et al 2008 mcvicar et al 2012 klamerus iwan et al 2017 measurements of the canopy storage capacity and the classification of wettability were performed at 12 rainfall temperatures 4 c 5 c 7 c 10 c 12 5 c 13 5 c 15 c 18 c 20 c 21 c 22 5 c and 25 c the wettability and canopy storage capacity for a wider spectrum of temperatures can be quickly determined with the calculator included in the supplementary materials the influence of the thermal expansion of water its evaporation and the change in the density and volume in relation to the temperature were not taken into account in laboratory studies possible differences in the wettability and s within one water temperature are the result of species characteristics especially of adhesive properties of the leaf surface which can be significant based on the contact angle 2 2 classification of wettability water was sprayed on top of the leaves with a sprinkler nozzle diameter 0 50 mm outdropping continued until ten images of droplets were available for analysis of the contact angle between the droplets and axial leaf surface all images were obtained in a shadow free chamber using a canon eos 450d camera with an ef 100 mm f 2 8 macro usm lens as shown at fig 1 the internal contact angle between the droplet and leaf α was measured using sigma scan v5 software the measurements were performed as described in owsiak et al 2013 to determine the effect of temperature on the size and contact angle of the droplets the methodology and terminology used to describe the droplets and their contact with the surface are based on rosado and holder 2013 distilled water poch s a with the following parameters was used γ l free surface energy of the measuring liquid 72 8 mj m2 γ l d dispersion component of the free surface energy of the measuring liquid 21 8 mj m2 γ l p polar component of the free surface energy of the measuring fluid 51 0 mj m2 and γ s γ s acid and basic components 25 5 and 25 5 mj m2 respectively the contact angles measured between droplets and leaves were compared using the classification proposed by aryal and neuner 2010 who characterized the contact angles of six classes of wettability a contact angle up to 40 was considered as superhydrophilic and those above 150 as superhydrophobic other contact angles are 40 90 highly wettable 90 110 wettable 110 130 non wettable and 130 150 highly non wettable 2 3 measurement of the canopy storage capacity in the laboratory twigs were weighed bm and subjected to a simulation with a fixed amount of precipitation followed by further reweighing the amount of water from the wet and dry mass difference a and the biomass bm obtained were used to calculate the canopy storage capacity s per biomass unit s a bm g g 1 the precipitation p was estimated to be 150 00 g of distilled water poch s a water in specified doses fell from a scaled container over the twig klamerus iwan and błońska 2017 the intensity was constant throughout the rain duration which provided comparable results for each case the container over which the branch was sprinkled was 40 50 cm in size therefore we covered 0 20 m2 with rain assuming that liter m2 of water is mm of water layer and that sprinkling was continued for 8 5 min which gives a constant intensity of 5 30 mm h 1 the position of the twigs during spraying was similar to their natural orientation on the tree studies of the canopy storage capacity using a fixed amount of simulated precipitation were carried out using twigs ranging from 30 35 cm in length that were selected from the twigs transported to the laboratory the experiment was carried out immediately after the plant material arrived at the laboratory very similar technically measurements were provided by garcia estringan et al 2010 who presented different measurement methods of the canopy storage capacity 2 4 statistical analysis statistica 10 software was used for statistical analysis the data for six tree species consisted of measurements of the canopy storage capacity and contact angles between droplets and the surfaces of leaves and needles at 12 different temperatures first linear regression was used to evaluate the effect of the water temperature on the wettability and canopy storage capacity of the branches alternatives to the applied linear regression analysis could be nonlinear regression analyses e g power functions the advantage of them would be to obtain a better matched function although the improvement would be small considering the scatterplots and high values of fit statistics r2 the disadvantage of applying nonlinear approximation methods would be the increase of the complexity of the function and thus hinder its interpretation the same method was used to assess the effect of the temperature on the wettability and s for all species analysis of variance anova was used to determine the significance of the differences in the contact angles and water storage capacity among species in addition two water temperature scenarios were used to forecast possible changes in the canopy storage capacity and wettability of leaves based on simulated rainfall temperature changes these scenarios are based on the study of air temperatures of socha and durło 2012 thus an increase in the mean annual temperature of 0 7 c corresponds to a 1 c increase during the growing season an increase in the mean annual temperature of 2 7 c corresponds to a 2 9 c increase during the growing season the scenarios by socha and durło 2012 also predict an increased total annual precipitation mm but reduced precipitation during the winter selected simulated rain temperatures are only indicators based on the data collected for all six species we developed a matrix using microsoft excel to show the effect of the temperature on the canopy storage capacity and contact angles of water droplets supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 effect of the rain temperature on the canopy storage capacity and wettability of leaves pooled analysis for all species we used linear regression analysis to evaluate the effect of the water temperature on the leaf wettability and canopy storage capacity with data from the leaves of all species pooled together the results show that the models describing the influence of the temperature on the wettability f 1 3375 40178 08 p 0 001 and canopy storage capacity f 1 3375 11914 40 p 0 001 provide good data fits table 1 this shows that these relationships may be assumed to be linear with little loss of predictive accuracy and therefore justifies our use of linear regression analysis temperature accounts for 92 of the variation in wettability and a t test indicates that the water temperature significantly influences the wettability t 200 44 p 0 001 the value of the standardized β coefficient β 0 96 indicates that this effect is strong and negative the value of the non standardized β coefficient β 3 44 indicates that a 1 c increase of the temperature decreases the contact angle of the water droplet by 3 44 table 1 the analysis of the canopy storage capacity indicates that the temperature explains 78 of the variation of this parameter and a t test implies that this effect is significant t 109 15 p 0 001 table 1 the value of the standardized β coefficient β 0 88 indicates that this effect is strong and positive the value of the non standardized β coefficient β 1 05 implies that a 1 c increase in the temperature increases the canopy storage capacity by 1 05 g g 1 table 1 table 2 shows the effects of two different water temperature change scenarios on the contact angles and canopy storage capacity for all species pooled together these results show that a 2 7 c increase in the temperature decreases the contact angle of the droplets by more than 9 and increases the canopy storage capacity by 2 85 g g 1 3 2 effect of the rainfall temperature on the canopy storage capacity and contact angles of droplets for different species our initial results summarize the effect of the water temperature for all species pooled together however the morphology of leaves of different species differs thus there are likely species specific differences in the contact angles of droplets and the quantity of water retained in the crowns our anova results show that the model describing the effect of temperature on the wettability table 3 and canopy storage capacity table 4 for each species provides good data fits p 0 05 for all results and that the regression parameters for the droplet contact angle and canopy storage capacity differ among the six species however the comparison of the r2 coefficients indicates that the temperature has similar general effects on the wettability and droplet contact angle among these six species the comparison of the non standardized b coefficients shows that a 1 c increase in temperature decreases the contact angle by 3 15 for oak smallest effect and by 3 71 for spruce largest effect fig 2 a change in the contact angle by 3 changes the classification of the leaf wettability from non wettable 110 130 angles to wettable 90 110 angles the matrix used to compute the effect of temperature on the canopy storage capacity and contact angle of droplets for all six species is provided in the supplementary materials given the differences among species we performed more detailed analysis the comparison of the r2 coefficients indicates that the water temperature predicts the canopy storage capacity best for spruce 0 86 and worst but still high for oak 0 78 the temperature is most accurate in predicting s highest amount of variance of coniferous species the comparison of the non standardized b coefficients indicates that a 1 c water temperature rise increases s by 1 35 g g 1 for beech 1 39 g g 1 for oak 1 89 g g 1 for small leaved lime 1 47 g g 1 for fir 1 46 g g 1 for pine and 1 71 g g 1 for spruce table 4 fig 3 table 5 shows the expected changes in the leaf wettability and canopy storage capacity of all six species following rainfall temperature increases of 0 7 c and 2 7 c coniferous species show greater decreases in the droplet contact angles and greater increases in the canopy storage capacity at both temperatures a rainfall temperature increase of 2 7 c decreases the droplet contact angle of spruce by 10 02 and increases s by 3 07 the rainfall temperature has the weakest effect on the droplet contact angle of small leaved lime 8 51 at 2 7 c and the weakest effect on s of beech 3 65 g g 1 at 2 7 c and small leaved lime 5 10 g g 1 at 2 7 c 4 discussion our results show that the rainfall temperature significantly affects the leaf wettability and canopy storage capacity more specifically a rainfall temperature increase of 1 c decreases the droplet contact angle by 3 15 in oak leaves smallest effect and by 3 71 in spruce needles largest effect and increases the canopy storage capacity of broadleaved species from 1 35 to 1 89 g g 1 and that of coniferous species from 1 43 to 1 71 g g 1 these differences among species confirm the effect of increasing temperature on the canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability and indicate that the results are not simply a reaction to temperature related changes in the water density a dynamic and kinematic coefficient of viscosity is needed for flow analyses when it comes to stopping drops on the surfaces of the leaves the viscosity certainly has an effect it has no effect on species differences at the same temperature but the change in the temperature function has an effect we did not assess the persistence of binding raindrops with leaves nor the influence of time in this study therefore there is no data for interpretation however the lower viscosity at higher temperatures makes it easier to drain water from the surface in addition if a drop falls from a leaf under field conditions it will hit subsequent layers of foliage nanko et al 2006 2011 effects of nozzle spray angle on droplet size were presented by fritz et al 2014 as the temperature rises from 5 c to 25 c the water density decreases and the volume increases assuming that the equilibrium equation is maintained the mass remains constant however as the temperature rises from 0 c to 30 c the value of the water surface tension decreases nonlinearly and thus causes an increase in the contact angle that is the wettability a nonlinear model is therefore suggested for future studies differences in the canopy storage capacity without water temperature influence have also been reported for bark levia and herwitz 2005 reported that bark of quercus rubra hold the most water and that of betula lenta the least ilek et al 2017 observed the highest variation of relative moisture in bark of quercus robur and picea abies and the lowest for that of fagus sylvatica a 2 7 c increase in the water temperature decreases the droplet contact angle of coniferous species by 9 06 10 02 and that broadleaved species by 8 51 8 91 and increases the canopy storage capacity of coniferous species by 3 97 g g 1 5 12 g g 1 and that of broad leaved species by 3 65 g g 1 5 10 g g 1 this observation is important because coniferous species do not shed their needles during winter thus throughout the year coniferous trees provide better protection from torrential precipitation events and reduce the amount of water reaching the forest floor and root systems intrastorm scale rainfall interception dynamics in a mature coniferous forest stand have been analysed by lida et al 2017 previous studies forecasted that an increased proportion of beech trees in pine spruce stands may help to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change pretzsch 2009 sayer and maginnis 2013 pretzsch et al 2016 also observed positive additive and multiplicative mixing effects on structural heterogeneity and stand productivity tree species have different ecological requirements and different capabilities to adapt to expected temperature changes the selection of the forest species composition should consider species that can better adapt to future rainfall changes regardless of the historical composition of the forest landscape zlatanov et al 2015 mixed stands provide the opportunity to select species that better adapt to temperature change our results show that all tested coniferous species spruce fir and pine react more strongly to water temperature changes than deciduous species beech oak and small leaved lime our results are compatible with previous reports that showed that spruce is highly vulnerable to air temperature changes hartl meier et al 2014 this is also reflected in the decreasing importance of spruce as crop tree jolly et al 2005 seidl et al 2011 elkin et al 2013 our results show that spruce has the greatest decrease in the water droplet angle and the greatest increase in the canopy storage capacity assuming water temperature increases of 0 7 c and 2 7 c respectively silver fir seems to be slightly more resistant to rainfall temperature changes peguero pina et al 2007 carrer et al 2010 our results on temperature induced changes of the canopy storage capacity are thus consistent with previous reports about the temperature sensitivity of these species moreover common beech and scots pine are more economically important species pretzsch et al 2013 the determination of the optimal mix and density of these forest trees should consider their hydrological characteristics which may be a new challenge for forest management our data indicate that scots pine similar to fir and spruce reacts strongly to an increase in the rainfall temperature in terms of the quantity of precipitation retained in the crown our results do not provide a definitive answer regarding the change of the water balance of forest ecosystems following a rainfall temperature change global environmental changes can affect the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources ukkola et al 2016 higher temperatures might also be associated with the wilting or drooping of foliage or at least in the turgor of leaves thus affecting the canopy storage capacity due to temporal variations in the duration frequency and magnitude of rainfall events matuszko and węglarczyk 2014 and evapotranspiration there are large seasonal and interannual variations in the fraction of intercepted rainfall within a site herbst et al 2008 klamerus iwan and błońska 2017 reported that the water storage crown capacity of common oak leaves is 6 in the beginning of the growing season and up to 22 in autumn berghuijs et al 2014 showed that the fraction of each year s precipitation falling as snow significantly influences the annual streamflow within individual catchments and suggested that there will be less streamflow if a warming climate produces less snow however data indicating that canopy storage capacity losses are temperature dependent must also be considered in the development of hydrological models wasko and sharma 2017 determined reduced streamflow at higher temperatures serengil et al 2011 concluded that the availability of water to the forest and economic activities aimed at mythologizing the water deficit are timely topics and their results raise concerns with respect to the amount of canopy storage capacity losses trees have long lives and the reconstruction of stands occurs over many years increasing the importance of ecohydrological changes due to increasing temperatures and can even be affected by isotopes allen et al 2017 research on living trees in the laboratory using simulated rainfall garcia estringana et al 2010 and on artificial woody parts dunkerley 2014 is needed to better understand the processes of interception and canopy storage capacity our laboratory studies performed under controlled conditions provide precise data that can be used to develop models to characterize canopy storage capacity changes due to rainfall temperature changes we used our results to develop a practical calculator to compute changes of the canopy storage capacity and droplet contact angle in leaves of different species this tool is very useful for the direct determination of the canopy storage capacity as a function of the water temperature in individual species and average values for all analysed species 5 conclusions our laboratory based studies under controlled conditions provide precise data to develop models describing canopy storage capacity and wettability changes due to water temperature changes the results obtained were used to develop a practical calculator computing changes of the canopy storage capacity and contact angles of droplets the results also contribute to better understand the species reaction to water temperature changes an increased water temperature decreases the contact angles of water droplets with leaves and needles and therefore increases their wettability we observed species specific differences in the effect of the increased water temperature on the canopy storage capacity and wettability demonstrating that the results are not simply a reaction to a temperature related change in the water density the rainfall temperature has the greatest effect on the canopy storage capacity of spruce and the smallest effect on oak this is important because of the planned species composition in forests the water temperature has similar effects on the leaf wettability expressed as droplet contact angle in all analysed species analysed the temperature induced increase of the leaf wettability increases the overall canopy storage capacity wettability can be treated as a physical feature of plant material which affects the canopy storage capacity the study presented here provides the missing element between rainfall temperature change and ecohydrological properties of particular species of trees that is the amount of water that can be retained in the crowns or the contact angle between droplets and leaves acknowledgments the

calculator to compute changes of s and contact angles of droplets was developed among all species an increase of the rainfall temperature by 0 7 c decreases the contact angle between leave and needle surfaces by 2 41 and increases the canopy storage capacity by 0 74 g g 1 an increase of the rain temperature by 2 7 c decreases the contact angle by 9 29 and increases the canopy storage capacity by 2 85 g g 1 a decreased contact angle between a water droplet and leaf surface indicates increased wettability thus our results show that an increased temperature increases the leaf wettability in all examined species the comparison of different species implies that the water temperature has the strongest effect on spruce and the weakest effect on oak these data indicate that the rainfall temperature influences the canopy storage capacity keywords crown retention hydrophobicity actual interception water balance contact angle calculator 1 introduction the wettability of the surfaces of broad leaves and needles is a physiological feature related to their morphology season and weather conditions wettability is responsible for the self cleaning lotus effect of hydrophobic leaves of selected species stosch et al 2007 tranquada and erb 2014 and for hydrophilic properties of leaves with hair aryal and neuner 2010 classified the wettability based on the contact angle between droplets and the leaf surface and many other studies used this classification scheme holder 2013 rosaldo and holder 2013 previous studies have indicated that the effect of temperature is important for the water density and the way in which droplets adhere to the leaves owsiak et al 2013 wettability is closely related to hydrological parameters such as the canopy storage capacity s previous hydrological studies considered s to be dependent on the species xiao and mcpherson 2016 leaf morphology herwitz 1985 tranquada and erb 2014 fernández and eicherd 2009 stratification of the tree stand nanko et al 2011 and season neinhuis and barthlott 1997 other studies examined the influence of factors associated with the intensity of precipitation and size of water droplets keim et al 2006 nanko et al 2006 klamerus iwan 2014 additionally several basic research studies hall and calder 1993 xiao and mcpherson 2016 determined the precise relationship between the canopy storage capacity and rainfall intensity to develop physical and empirical models for interception liu 2001 d almeida et al 2006 the canopy storage capacity is related to the water balance of a forest which in turn has large scale microclimatic effects as described by aussenac 2000 the amount of water retained in a tree crown may be considered as loss or delay of water reaching the soil where it is available for uptake the level of the canopy storage capacity affects the circulation of water in the atmosphere verstraeten et al 2005 overdieck and forstreuter 1994 zhang et al 2016 estimated that global evapotranspiration consists of 65 transpiration from vegetation 25 evapotranspiration from soil and 10 vaporization of intercepted rainfall from vegetation using the penman monteith leuning pml model in the intermediate temperate zone deciduous and coniferous tree crowns can retain even more water gash et al 1995 the canopy storage capacity is particularly important in regions with a negative water balance martin and von willert 2000 sadeghi et al 2014 where the amount of water captured by the tree crown has a greater hydrologic significance and in regions in which changes in climate and water conditions can alter the abundance of different forest trees e g beech in poland for example total precipitation duration of time below 0 c and extent of temperature fluctuations during the day affect the beech distribution chojnacka ożga and ożga 2012 the degree of water availability also affects the biodiversity and is therefore an important issue in sustainable forest management the amount of water retained in tree crowns which is unavailable to roots is an important issue that has been addressed at many international union of forest research organizations iufro conferences such changes occur globally serengil et al 2011 any change in the quantity and quality of rainfall is difficult to predict but related to the air temperature wasko and sharma 2017 small and large rain drops do not have a uniform temperature due to the more rapid evaporation of small droplets therefore the difference between the temperature of bulk rain and that of ambient air is not constant during a rainfall event and the rain can be up to several degrees c colder than the ambient air byers et al 1949 abraham 1962 changes in the air temperature thus cause changes in the precipitation temperature rainfall temperature changes may affect the wettability and water availability of forest ecosystems huntington 2006 ryan and vose 2012 mátyás and sun 2014 the global climate is currently warming a trend that is expected to continue and these changes are partly associated with drastic shifts inprecipitation regimes fitzgerald and lindner 2013 ipcc 2014 even in the seasonal changes pattern the temperature of precipitation may affect the amount of water retained in the crown levia and herwitz 2000 reported that the physical properties of water can have significant implications for chemical leaching of trees due to differential contact times with the tree surface thus studies of the effects of the water temperature change must also consider the canopy storage capacity of tree crowns studies are needed to assess the relationship between rainfall temperature changes and the ecohydrological properties of particular species of trees these studies must consider the amount of water that is retained in the crowns in analysis of the overall water balance the general aim of the research presented here was to analyse the relationship between the canopy storage capacity and different classes of leaf wettability and rainfall temperatures and to forecast the effect of rainfall temperature changes on the wettability of leaf and needle surfaces based on two scenarios we tested three specific hypotheses first as the simulated rainfall temperature increases the contact angles of droplets decrease and the wettability of leaf surfaces increases second as the wettability increases the canopy storage capacity increases third an increased water temperature has different effects on the canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability of different species 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling sites the study site is located in krynica zdrój that is the experimental forestry unit of the university of agriculture in cracow southern poland the dominant tree species were silver fir abies alba mill european beech fagus sylvatica l and norway spruce picea abies l the forest cover in this area exceeds 60 of which 41 5 is fir 22 is beech 18 5 is norway spruce and 18 is due to other species the study area has an average annual rainfall of 1000 mm and average annual temperature of 5 3 c the leaves and needles of six common european tree species were collected common oak quercus robur l common beech fagus sylvatica l small leaved lime tilia cordata mill silver fir abies alba scots pine pinus sylvestris l and norway spruce picea abies l leafy twigs were collected with a telescopic snapper due to seasonal changes in the foliage that could affect the wettability and canopy storage capacity of the tree crowns klamerus iwan and błońska 2017 all collections were performed in june and the first week of july of 2015 twenty five leafy twigs were collected from different locations in the crown and protected from drying during transport to the laboratory in plastic containers all measurements were performed immediately after arrival all analyses were performed under constant humidity 48 50 in the laboratory effects of wind air pressure and relative humidity were not taken into account other studies showed that the air temperature atmospheric humidity and radiation affect the water density and adhesion of droplets to leaves willett et al 2008 mcvicar et al 2012 klamerus iwan et al 2017 measurements of the canopy storage capacity and the classification of wettability were performed at 12 rainfall temperatures 4 c 5 c 7 c 10 c 12 5 c 13 5 c 15 c 18 c 20 c 21 c 22 5 c and 25 c the wettability and canopy storage capacity for a wider spectrum of temperatures can be quickly determined with the calculator included in the supplementary materials the influence of the thermal expansion of water its evaporation and the change in the density and volume in relation to the temperature were not taken into account in laboratory studies possible differences in the wettability and s within one water temperature are the result of species characteristics especially of adhesive properties of the leaf surface which can be significant based on the contact angle 2 2 classification of wettability water was sprayed on top of the leaves with a sprinkler nozzle diameter 0 50 mm outdropping continued until ten images of droplets were available for analysis of the contact angle between the droplets and axial leaf surface all images were obtained in a shadow free chamber using a canon eos 450d camera with an ef 100 mm f 2 8 macro usm lens as shown at fig 1 the internal contact angle between the droplet and leaf α was measured using sigma scan v5 software the measurements were performed as described in owsiak et al 2013 to determine the effect of temperature on the size and contact angle of the droplets the methodology and terminology used to describe the droplets and their contact with the surface are based on rosado and holder 2013 distilled water poch s a with the following parameters was used γ l free surface energy of the measuring liquid 72 8 mj m2 γ l d dispersion component of the free surface energy of the measuring liquid 21 8 mj m2 γ l p polar component of the free surface energy of the measuring fluid 51 0 mj m2 and γ s γ s acid and basic components 25 5 and 25 5 mj m2 respectively the contact angles measured between droplets and leaves were compared using the classification proposed by aryal and neuner 2010 who characterized the contact angles of six classes of wettability a contact angle up to 40 was considered as superhydrophilic and those above 150 as superhydrophobic other contact angles are 40 90 highly wettable 90 110 wettable 110 130 non wettable and 130 150 highly non wettable 2 3 measurement of the canopy storage capacity in the laboratory twigs were weighed bm and subjected to a simulation with a fixed amount of precipitation followed by further reweighing the amount of water from the wet and dry mass difference a and the biomass bm obtained were used to calculate the canopy storage capacity s per biomass unit s a bm g g 1 the precipitation p was estimated to be 150 00 g of distilled water poch s a water in specified doses fell from a scaled container over the twig klamerus iwan and błońska 2017 the intensity was constant throughout the rain duration which provided comparable results for each case the container over which the branch was sprinkled was 40 50 cm in size therefore we covered 0 20 m2 with rain assuming that liter m2 of water is mm of water layer and that sprinkling was continued for 8 5 min which gives a constant intensity of 5 30 mm h 1 the position of the twigs during spraying was similar to their natural orientation on the tree studies of the canopy storage capacity using a fixed amount of simulated precipitation were carried out using twigs ranging from 30 35 cm in length that were selected from the twigs transported to the laboratory the experiment was carried out immediately after the plant material arrived at the laboratory very similar technically measurements were provided by garcia estringan et al 2010 who presented different measurement methods of the canopy storage capacity 2 4 statistical analysis statistica 10 software was used for statistical analysis the data for six tree species consisted of measurements of the canopy storage capacity and contact angles between droplets and the surfaces of leaves and needles at 12 different temperatures first linear regression was used to evaluate the effect of the water temperature on the wettability and canopy storage capacity of the branches alternatives to the applied linear regression analysis could be nonlinear regression analyses e g power functions the advantage of them would be to obtain a better matched function although the improvement would be small considering the scatterplots and high values of fit statistics r2 the disadvantage of applying nonlinear approximation methods would be the increase of the complexity of the function and thus hinder its interpretation the same method was used to assess the effect of the temperature on the wettability and s for all species analysis of variance anova was used to determine the significance of the differences in the contact angles and water storage capacity among species in addition two water temperature scenarios were used to forecast possible changes in the canopy storage capacity and wettability of leaves based on simulated rainfall temperature changes these scenarios are based on the study of air temperatures of socha and durło 2012 thus an increase in the mean annual temperature of 0 7 c corresponds to a 1 c increase during the growing season an increase in the mean annual temperature of 2 7 c corresponds to a 2 9 c increase during the growing season the scenarios by socha and durło 2012 also predict an increased total annual precipitation mm but reduced precipitation during the winter selected simulated rain temperatures are only indicators based on the data collected for all six species we developed a matrix using microsoft excel to show the effect of the temperature on the canopy storage capacity and contact angles of water droplets supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 effect of the rain temperature on the canopy storage capacity and wettability of leaves pooled analysis for all species we used linear regression analysis to evaluate the effect of the water temperature on the leaf wettability and canopy storage capacity with data from the leaves of all species pooled together the results show that the models describing the influence of the temperature on the wettability f 1 3375 40178 08 p 0 001 and canopy storage capacity f 1 3375 11914 40 p 0 001 provide good data fits table 1 this shows that these relationships may be assumed to be linear with little loss of predictive accuracy and therefore justifies our use of linear regression analysis temperature accounts for 92 of the variation in wettability and a t test indicates that the water temperature significantly influences the wettability t 200 44 p 0 001 the value of the standardized β coefficient β 0 96 indicates that this effect is strong and negative the value of the non standardized β coefficient β 3 44 indicates that a 1 c increase of the temperature decreases the contact angle of the water droplet by 3 44 table 1 the analysis of the canopy storage capacity indicates that the temperature explains 78 of the variation of this parameter and a t test implies that this effect is significant t 109 15 p 0 001 table 1 the value of the standardized β coefficient β 0 88 indicates that this effect is strong and positive the value of the non standardized β coefficient β 1 05 implies that a 1 c increase in the temperature increases the canopy storage capacity by 1 05 g g 1 table 1 table 2 shows the effects of two different water temperature change scenarios on the contact angles and canopy storage capacity for all species pooled together these results show that a 2 7 c increase in the temperature decreases the contact angle of the droplets by more than 9 and increases the canopy storage capacity by 2 85 g g 1 3 2 effect of the rainfall temperature on the canopy storage capacity and contact angles of droplets for different species our initial results summarize the effect of the water temperature for all species pooled together however the morphology of leaves of different species differs thus there are likely species specific differences in the contact angles of droplets and the quantity of water retained in the crowns our anova results show that the model describing the effect of temperature on the wettability table 3 and canopy storage capacity table 4 for each species provides good data fits p 0 05 for all results and that the regression parameters for the droplet contact angle and canopy storage capacity differ among the six species however the comparison of the r2 coefficients indicates that the temperature has similar general effects on the wettability and droplet contact angle among these six species the comparison of the non standardized b coefficients shows that a 1 c increase in temperature decreases the contact angle by 3 15 for oak smallest effect and by 3 71 for spruce largest effect fig 2 a change in the contact angle by 3 changes the classification of the leaf wettability from non wettable 110 130 angles to wettable 90 110 angles the matrix used to compute the effect of temperature on the canopy storage capacity and contact angle of droplets for all six species is provided in the supplementary materials given the differences among species we performed more detailed analysis the comparison of the r2 coefficients indicates that the water temperature predicts the canopy storage capacity best for spruce 0 86 and worst but still high for oak 0 78 the temperature is most accurate in predicting s highest amount of variance of coniferous species the comparison of the non standardized b coefficients indicates that a 1 c water temperature rise increases s by 1 35 g g 1 for beech 1 39 g g 1 for oak 1 89 g g 1 for small leaved lime 1 47 g g 1 for fir 1 46 g g 1 for pine and 1 71 g g 1 for spruce table 4 fig 3 table 5 shows the expected changes in the leaf wettability and canopy storage capacity of all six species following rainfall temperature increases of 0 7 c and 2 7 c coniferous species show greater decreases in the droplet contact angles and greater increases in the canopy storage capacity at both temperatures a rainfall temperature increase of 2 7 c decreases the droplet contact angle of spruce by 10 02 and increases s by 3 07 the rainfall temperature has the weakest effect on the droplet contact angle of small leaved lime 8 51 at 2 7 c and the weakest effect on s of beech 3 65 g g 1 at 2 7 c and small leaved lime 5 10 g g 1 at 2 7 c 4 discussion our results show that the rainfall temperature significantly affects the leaf wettability and canopy storage capacity more specifically a rainfall temperature increase of 1 c decreases the droplet contact angle by 3 15 in oak leaves smallest effect and by 3 71 in spruce needles largest effect and increases the canopy storage capacity of broadleaved species from 1 35 to 1 89 g g 1 and that of coniferous species from 1 43 to 1 71 g g 1 these differences among species confirm the effect of increasing temperature on the canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability and indicate that the results are not simply a reaction to temperature related changes in the water density a dynamic and kinematic coefficient of viscosity is needed for flow analyses when it comes to stopping drops on the surfaces of the leaves the viscosity certainly has an effect it has no effect on species differences at the same temperature but the change in the temperature function has an effect we did not assess the persistence of binding raindrops with leaves nor the influence of time in this study therefore there is no data for interpretation however the lower viscosity at higher temperatures makes it easier to drain water from the surface in addition if a drop falls from a leaf under field conditions it will hit subsequent layers of foliage nanko et al 2006 2011 effects of nozzle spray angle on droplet size were presented by fritz et al 2014 as the temperature rises from 5 c to 25 c the water density decreases and the volume increases assuming that the equilibrium equation is maintained the mass remains constant however as the temperature rises from 0 c to 30 c the value of the water surface tension decreases nonlinearly and thus causes an increase in the contact angle that is the wettability a nonlinear model is therefore suggested for future studies differences in the canopy storage capacity without water temperature influence have also been reported for bark levia and herwitz 2005 reported that bark of quercus rubra hold the most water and that of betula lenta the least ilek et al 2017 observed the highest variation of relative moisture in bark of quercus robur and picea abies and the lowest for that of fagus sylvatica a 2 7 c increase in the water temperature decreases the droplet contact angle of coniferous species by 9 06 10 02 and that broadleaved species by 8 51 8 91 and increases the canopy storage capacity of coniferous species by 3 97 g g 1 5 12 g g 1 and that of broad leaved species by 3 65 g g 1 5 10 g g 1 this observation is important because coniferous species do not shed their needles during winter thus throughout the year coniferous trees provide better protection from torrential precipitation events and reduce the amount of water reaching the forest floor and root systems intrastorm scale rainfall interception dynamics in a mature coniferous forest stand have been analysed by lida et al 2017 previous studies forecasted that an increased proportion of beech trees in pine spruce stands may help to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change pretzsch 2009 sayer and maginnis 2013 pretzsch et al 2016 also observed positive additive and multiplicative mixing effects on structural heterogeneity and stand productivity tree species have different ecological requirements and different capabilities to adapt to expected temperature changes the selection of the forest species composition should consider species that can better adapt to future rainfall changes regardless of the historical composition of the forest landscape zlatanov et al 2015 mixed stands provide the opportunity to select species that better adapt to temperature change our results show that all tested coniferous species spruce fir and pine react more strongly to water temperature changes than deciduous species beech oak and small leaved lime our results are compatible with previous reports that showed that spruce is highly vulnerable to air temperature changes hartl meier et al 2014 this is also reflected in the decreasing importance of spruce as crop tree jolly et al 2005 seidl et al 2011 elkin et al 2013 our results show that spruce has the greatest decrease in the water droplet angle and the greatest increase in the canopy storage capacity assuming water temperature increases of 0 7 c and 2 7 c respectively silver fir seems to be slightly more resistant to rainfall temperature changes peguero pina et al 2007 carrer et al 2010 our results on temperature induced changes of the canopy storage capacity are thus consistent with previous reports about the temperature sensitivity of these species moreover common beech and scots pine are more economically important species pretzsch et al 2013 the determination of the optimal mix and density of these forest trees should consider their hydrological characteristics which may be a new challenge for forest management our data indicate that scots pine similar to fir and spruce reacts strongly to an increase in the rainfall temperature in terms of the quantity of precipitation retained in the crown our results do not provide a definitive answer regarding the change of the water balance of forest ecosystems following a rainfall temperature change global environmental changes can affect the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources ukkola et al 2016 higher temperatures might also be associated with the wilting or drooping of foliage or at least in the turgor of leaves thus affecting the canopy storage capacity due to temporal variations in the duration frequency and magnitude of rainfall events matuszko and węglarczyk 2014 and evapotranspiration there are large seasonal and interannual variations in the fraction of intercepted rainfall within a site herbst et al 2008 klamerus iwan and błońska 2017 reported that the water storage crown capacity of common oak leaves is 6 in the beginning of the growing season and up to 22 in autumn berghuijs et al 2014 showed that the fraction of each year s precipitation falling as snow significantly influences the annual streamflow within individual catchments and suggested that there will be less streamflow if a warming climate produces less snow however data indicating that canopy storage capacity losses are temperature dependent must also be considered in the development of hydrological models wasko and sharma 2017 determined reduced streamflow at higher temperatures serengil et al 2011 concluded that the availability of water to the forest and economic activities aimed at mythologizing the water deficit are timely topics and their results raise concerns with respect to the amount of canopy storage capacity losses trees have long lives and the reconstruction of stands occurs over many years increasing the importance of ecohydrological changes due to increasing temperatures and can even be affected by isotopes allen et al 2017 research on living trees in the laboratory using simulated rainfall garcia estringana et al 2010 and on artificial woody parts dunkerley 2014 is needed to better understand the processes of interception and canopy storage capacity our laboratory studies performed under controlled conditions provide precise data that can be used to develop models to characterize canopy storage capacity changes due to rainfall temperature changes we used our results to develop a practical calculator to compute changes of the canopy storage capacity and droplet contact angle in leaves of different species this tool is very useful for the direct determination of the canopy storage capacity as a function of the water temperature in individual species and average values for all analysed species 5 conclusions our laboratory based studies under controlled conditions provide precise data to develop models describing canopy storage capacity and wettability changes due to water temperature changes the results obtained were used to develop a practical calculator computing changes of the canopy storage capacity and contact angles of droplets the results also contribute to better understand the species reaction to water temperature changes an increased water temperature decreases the contact angles of water droplets with leaves and needles and therefore increases their wettability we observed species specific differences in the effect of the increased water temperature on the canopy storage capacity and wettability demonstrating that the results are not simply a reaction to a temperature related change in the water density the rainfall temperature has the greatest effect on the canopy storage capacity of spruce and the smallest effect on oak this is important because of the planned species composition in forests the water temperature has similar effects on the leaf wettability expressed as droplet contact angle in all analysed species analysed the temperature induced increase of the leaf wettability increases the overall canopy storage capacity wettability can be treated as a physical feature of plant material which affects the canopy storage capacity the study presented here provides the missing element between rainfall temperature change and ecohydrological properties of particular species of trees that is the amount of water that can be retained in the crowns or the contact angle between droplets and leaves acknowledgments the

7403,in coupled sewer and surface flood modelling approaches the flow process in gullies is often ignored although the overland flow is drained to sewer network via inlets and gullies therefore the flow entering inlets is transferred to the sewer network immediately which may lead to a different flood estimation than the reality in this paper we compared two modelling approach with and without considering the flow processes in gullies in the coupled sewer and surface modelling three historical flood events were adopted for model calibration and validation the results showed that the inclusion of flow process in gullies can further improve the accuracy of urban flood modelling keywords coupled 1d 2d flood model dynamic flow interaction model comparison overland flow roof drainage storm sewer flow 1 introduction flooding is a major hazard in many urban areas that leads to significant damage to properties and disruption of services hydraulic modelling is the key for better understanding of flood dynamic such that enhanced adaptation measures can be applied for disaster risk reduction drr for most modern cities storm sewer networks are built to manage surface water caused by local rainfall however the cost for the construction and maintenance of drainage networks is expensive such that a standard between 1 in 1and 1 in 30 years balmforth et al 2006 bloomberg and strickland 2012 bsi 2008 ciwem udg 2016 is often used for designing sewer systems to evaluate the consequence of flooding due to extreme weather conditions that are beyond the design standard one dimensional 1d sewer flow models sfms are widely adopted to examine the performance of drainage systems for dealing with intense rainfall arnbjerg nielsen 2008 rossman 2010 to better describe the movement of surcharge flow from sewer networks instead of using simplified depth volume functions overland flow models ofms are introduced to simulate the runoff dynamic on the ground surface the approach coupling of sfm and ofm is regarded as the dual drainage approach djordjević et al 1999 that can be either a combination of 1d sfm and 1d ofm leandro et al 2009 or a combination of 1d sfm and two dimensional 2d ofm chen et al 2007 hsu et al 2002 each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages allitt et al 2009 in the last decade coupled 1d sfm and 2d ofm have been widely applied to urban flood modelling jahanbazi and egger 2014 russo et al 2015 seyoum et al 2012 vojinovic and tutulic 2009 recently leandro and martins 2016 coupled 2d ofm with 1d sfm swmm 5 1 using dynamic link libraries that avoids changing the source code in swmm martins et al 2017 compared three approaches that were all coupled to the same 1d sfm to analyse the differences in modelling results using the full shallow water equations the local inertial equations and the diffusive wave equations as the 2d ofm in our previous study chang et al 2015 we compared six combinations of 1d sfm and 2d ofm in urban flood modelling including 1 2d ofm only 2 2d ofm with rainfall reduction or infiltration rate 3 combined sfm ofm 4 coupled sfm ofm 5 coupled ofm sfm and 6 mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling details of these modelling approaches are provided in chang et al 2015 the results showed that the bidirectional interaction between the sewer network and the ground surface must be included in modelling to provide more accurate estimations i e approaches 4 6 furthermore the interaction between the two systems may vary because different land cover conditions have different mechanisms for example if rainfall on a flat roof is collected and drained directly to the sewer network then the downstream network may surcharge due to high discharge into the system and the coupled sfm ofm approach is adequate to simulate the condition that the sewer flow returns to the surface on the other hand the excess runoff from the precipitation falling on pervious area may propagate along terrain until reaching an inlet that drains the overland flow into the sewer system which is better reflected by the coupled ofm sfm approach for coping with real world problems that are often a combination of these two situations the mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling was therefore developed as a solution chang et al 2015 sewer inlets are the main interface introducing surface runoff into underground drainage network nevertheless in hydraulic modelling this process is often simplified or neglected because the details of input data required the recent improvement of data availability has enabled the possibility to analyse the flow behaviour through inlets and their influence in flood modelling shepherd et al 2012 assess the performance of road gullies through a systematic numerical modelling bazin et al 2014 and chen et al 2016 investigated how the flow regime through inlet and manhole changes under different flow conditions and proposed a set of methods to calculate the discharge djordjević et al 2012 and martins et al 2014 adopted the computational fluid dynamics cfd model openfoam to simulate the flow interaction through a gully which was compared to laboratory measurements different laboratory gullies and openfoam settings were employed in these two studies gomez et al 2016 compared the numerical modelling results using flow 3d with the experimental data to evaluate the inlet coefficient lopes et al 2016 also adopted similar approach to estimate the efficiency of gully with grate slots in this study we developed an innovative approach to better simulate the function of inlets during flood events which was compared to the above mentioned methods against the measurements in both underground and overland systems of three historical events the models were calibrated and validated via three flood events with different attributes i e constant moderate rainfall with long duration intense rainfall with short duration and extreme rainfall with short duration the results showed the need to incorporate the new methodology to further improve of modelling accuracy in the mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling approach 2 methodology 2 1 2d ofm we adopted and 2d non inertia ofm to simulate the flood propagation on the ground surface the 2d ofm is coupled with the storm water management model swmm huber and dickinson 1988 version 4 4 to simulate the bidirectional interactions between the overland and the sewer systems both 2d ofm and swmm4 4 are developed in fortran hence they are coupled and compiled as a single code assuming the local and convective accelerations are small compared with the gravity and friction terms the acceleration terms in the swes are neglected in the governing equations of the 2d ofm 1 d t ud x vd y q s x y t q i

derivation of finite difference method for the 2d ofm was depicted in hsu et al 2000 2 2 interaction between ofm and sfm without gullies as mentioned earlier we have developed six approaches in an earlier study of urban flood modelling chang et al 2015 two of the approaches only involve with 2d ofm and no interaction with 1d sfm is considered the combined sfm ofm approach runs the 1d sfm to

zero 2 3 interaction between ofm and sfm with gullies in the aforementioned coupled sfm ofm or ofm sfm approaches we simplified the flow dynamic between inlets and manhole assuming flow transferring from an inlet to a manhole instantly and the flow interaction between sfm and ofm depends on the flow condition at the manhole nevertheless inlets are connected to manholes via gullies in reality and the simplification may not reflect the physical phenomena accurately in this study we considered the influence of gullies and built a more detailed model with inlets and gullies correctly positioned and connected as a result in most conditions the flow exchange between sfm and ofm can only take place at inlets the only exception is when the high pressure in the sewer network displaces of a manhole cover thus removing the obstacle for the sfm and ofm flow interaction an innovative approach for dealing with various flow situations related to manhole cover displacement has been developed by chen et al 2016 3 model applications and comparison 3 1 case study in this paper we aimed to compare the two mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling approaches i e without and with considering the flow process in gullies as model a and model b shown in fig 1 respectively and discuss their suitability in modelling practices we selected the datong district a low lying area in the northwest part of downtown taipei as the case study the area is located close to the junction where the keelung river and the tamsui river meet most of the area has an elevation below 5 m above mean sea level as shown in fig 2 and the terrain gradually declines from southeast to west with an average slope of 0 7 flood levees on the west side along the tamsui river and on the north side along the keelung river protect the downtown taipei from fluvial flooding the elevated motorway passing the northeast corner of the district forms a closed boundary that connects the two levees along the tamsui and keelung rivers the area is highly developed as shown in fig 3 with 42 covered by buildings 28 by roads 17 as public open space and only 13 as green areas we used a 4 m resolution digital elevation with a total of 400 000 cells and a 0 5 s time step for 2d ofm while 1 s time step was used for 1d sfm fig 4 shows the four storm water drainage networks within the area including 1367 manholes and 29 5 km of pipes that can cope with intense rainfall up to 1 in 5 year return period apart from the one network 3 in the northwest the other three networks 1 2 and 4 are connected via three pipes a b and c that allow overflowing from one network to another for easing the burden of the network during extreme conditions sluice gates are installed at the outlets of drainage networks that allow for gravity drainage if the water level in the tamsui or the keelung river stops drainage by gravity the pumping stations are switched on to exclude the storm water to avoid backwater building up in the sewer network s the total pumping capacity of the four stations is substantial each pumping station has multiple pumps that are operated automatically based on the outer water level in the river and the inner water level at the detention pool if the outer water level is higher than the inner water level that prevents gravity drainage pump s will be switched on to discharge the sewer flow into the rivers the number of pumps in operation depends on the water level in the detention pool the rainfall observations from the taiping elementary school tes rain gauge as shown in fig 4 and the water level records at the network outlets and the water level wl gauge in the centre of the whole catchment were used for model calibration and validation the water level at the network outlets included the river water levels and the ones at the detention pools next to the pumping stations 3 2 flood events we collected the records of three recent events in 2015 i e 19 july 23 july and 7 8 august in the case study area for model calibration and validation we adopted the observations at the tes rain gauges as the rainfall inputs and the river water levels at the outlets of pumping stations as the downstream boundary conditions the water level records at the wl gauge and the detention pools were used for calibration and validation the operation rules of pumping stations including the start and stop levels of each pump were applied in the modelling to switch pumps on and off automatically the modelled hydrographs at the detention pools and the wl gauge were compared to the observed data and evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 we also adopted the indicators accuracy sensitivity and precision that were defined as functions of true positive tp false

tn tp tn fp fn 8 sensitivity tp tp fn 9 precision tp tp fp the 7 8 august 2015 event was caused by typhoon soudelor that brought in 257 mm rainfall within 16 h as shown in fig 5 a the inner water levels started to increase in all four networks after 23 00 on 7 august when the rainfall began the outer water levels in river channels exceeded the inner water levels at the outlets of networks 3 and 4 around 01 00 which stopped drainage by gravity and the pumping stations were switched on to discharge the flow from the sewer networks to the rivers the outer water levels increased above the inner water levels at outlets of network 1 and 2 around 1 50 and 02 20 respectively when the pumps began to work at these two stations the prolonged precipitation resulted in high flow rates in sewer pipes which were close to their full capacity in most part of the network and a minor flooding was reported at one location however no detail regarding the flood extent or depth was available the flow situation of this event was in between the other two events and only a minor surface flooding occurred such that the event was used for model calibration the convective rainfall event on 19 july 2015 dumped 23 mm rainfall in the case study area while 15 5 mm concentrated within 20 min as shown in fig 6 a the rainfall intensity was below the design rainfall 78 5 mm h so the sewer networks were able to convey runoff without operating the pumping stations on 23 july 2015 the area was hit by another storm that brought 125 mm rainfall within 2 h as shown in fig 7 a with 62 mm concentrated during the peak 30 min the sewer networks were unable to cope with such intense rainfall and flooding occurred in several locations both events which represent moderate and extreme conditions respectively have complete water level records at the outlets and the wl gauge in the sewer networks so that we adopted the records to validate the modelling results 3 3 modelling results 3 3 1 model calibration the modelled water levels at the detention pools of network outlets and the wl gauge using the two mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling approaches i e model a and model b without and with considering the flow processes in gullies respectively of the 7 8 august 2015 event are compared to the observation records in fig 8 the peak water levels at the wl gauge were following the peaks of the change of rainfall intensity the results from both models a and b captured the trend properly with only slight overestimation during the peaks the water levels in the detention pools at the outlets from both models were very similar for all four networks the water level at network 4 outlet fig 8 e varied almost simultaneously with the changes of rainfall intensity with a 10 15 min delay because the catchment is relatively small and the location of the outlet is very close to the tes gauge the river water level quickly rose above the water level in the detention pool such that the pump operation played an important role in managing the water level four pumps were switched on when the water level at the pool exceeded 0 95 m 0 97 m 1 0 m and 1 02 m respectively the pumps were operating until the water level reduced to 0 18 m 0 31 m 0 31 m and 0 35 m respectively when the pumps were running the water level at the pool was dominated by the operation of pumps rather than the rainfall the same conditions apply to the water level hydrograph at the network 3 outlet pool fig 8 d due to the larger catchment areas and the longer distances of main trunks the water levels at outlets of networks 1 and 2 varied less significantly with the changes of rainfall intensity than the ones in networks 3 and 4 the water level at network 1 outlet pool fig 8 b increased until 01 50 when the river water level exceeded than the pool water level so the pump station began operation after 05 00 the water level dropped quickly as the result of reduced rainfall and the continuous operation of the pumping station similar responses can be found at the network 2 outlet pool fig 8 c the water level changes at the wl gauge fig 8 a and the variation of the hydrograph at the network 2 outlet pool fig 8 c show the backwater effect from the downstream therefore the relationship between the rainfall intensity and the water level at the wl gauge was not obvious the parameters to be calibrated were the roughness in both the 2d ofm and the 1d sfm the parameters were adjusted based on land cover types and pipe diameters and slopes and calibrated until the modelled water level hydrographs at all locations were consistent with the observed ones i e nse was close to 1 the roughness values were determined as 1 0 02 for roads plazas pavements etc 2 0 08 for green lands parks etc and 3 0 05 for built up areas the range of roughness of pipes was 0 013 0 018 in general model a predicted slightly higher water level than model b did especially for the peak values the nses shown in table 1 indicate that model b performed better than model a for the wl gauge and all networks 3 3 2 model validation fig 9 compares the observed and modelled water level hydrographs at the network outlets and the wl gauge of 19 july 2015 event the rainfall was not intense and long enough to result in high river levels and to trigger the operation of pumping stations the records show that the water level at the wl gauge fig 9 a increased rapidly right after the rainfall started and reached to the peak level with a 15 min lag to the peak rainfall this reflected the time of concentration at the node for collecting the surface runoff from its subcatchment after the rainfall stopped the water level gradually decreased because the coming discharge from further upstream pipes kept the water level high both models a and b produced very similar changing trend but with 0 08 m and 0 06 m over estimation of the peak level respectively for the water levels at the outlets the outer water levels dropped below than the ones in pools such that pumping stations were not activated the sewer flows were slowly discharged to the rivers by gravity which was also reflected in the slow declining water level at the wl gauge table 2 show the nses of the modelled water level hydrographs compared to the observations apart from the outlet of network 2 which both models produced perfect predictions model b performed better than model a for all locations the reason for the perfect predictions was that the event was very short such that only limited observation records can be compared to fig 10 compares the observation and modelled water level at the network outlets and the wl gauge of 23 july event the wl gauge records show that the water level increased rapidly right after the rainfall started and stayed at a constant peak level because the full capacity of the network has been reached the situation lasted for an hour because the coming discharge from further upstream pipes kept the water level high then the water level started to decrease 30 min after the rainfall intensity has become lower than the design rainfall intensity fig 10 a shows that model a has faster rising and declining limbs of the water level than model b it was due to that the flow response time in the gullies was not considered in model a such that the surface water entered the sewer network more quickly for the receding part the water level in model a began to decrease at eight minutes earlier than the observation while the model b result showed a slower timing and pace of water receding it was due to that model b was able to capture more surface water through gully inlets from the upstream catchments such that the water level maintained higher than model a for longer the water levels at network outlets rapidly increased when the rainfall intensity was above the design rainfall the operation of pumping station 1 quickly reduced the water level from 13 50 in general the water level in model b increased at a slower rate because the flow process in gullies was considered that the runoff collected from inlets reached to the manhole later than the one in model a which assumes that the runoff moves from inlets to manhole immediately this led to a slower rate of overland flow entering the sewer network which resulted in later water level increase in the rising part of the hydrograph in sewer network and a lower discharge of the surcharge flow downstream consequently more water volume stayed in the sewer network such that the water level took longer time to recede which can be observed in the water level hydrographs for other networks the pumps began operating around 13 20 because the continuous rainfall in previous 30 min has increased the water levels at the detention pools at wl gauge a at the outlet detention pools of networks 1 4 b e respectively table 3 shows the nses of the modelled water level hydrographs compared to the observations clearly model b performed better than model a for all locations although the pumping stations managed to cope with the flow concentrating to the outlets the upstream pipes of the networks were unable to convey all inflow such that surcharge occurred as discussed earlier about the condition at the wl gauge fig 11 and fig 12 compare the modelled flood extents to the surveyed one which was investigated by taipei city government after the event for model a and b respectively the field survey was carried out on the basis of road sections such that the flood extents were delineated along the roads as a result the mapped extent may be slightly inconsistent to the real flood situations unfortunately there was no detailed flood depth information attached such that it was not possible to compare the modelled flood depth to the observation the flood extent in the subcatchments nearby the wl gauge in model a was smaller than in model b but the simulated flood extents from both models were close to the surveyed one the negligence of the flow process in gullies allowed overland flow to enter the upstream manhole more easily such that the modelled flood extent was smaller in this area same situation occurred in the upstream area of network 4 i e the flood extent near the bottom boundary where model a simulated a smaller flood extent than model b because the model setting collected more surface runoff from nearby region for network 3 the increased upstream flow in model a led to a greater flood extent along the main road in the east subcatchment the long road spans the upstream subcatchments of four branches the flooding in model a was due to the surcharge water from the second bottom branch that the higher flow in the main trunk affected the runoff entering from this branch the surcharged water propagated along the main road and flowed southward due to the terrain configuration in model b the gullies could not drain the runoff in the northern part on the same road such that more flooding in that area was simulated nevertheless it reduced the downstream pipe flow such that simulated flood extent in the midstream area in model b was smaller than in model a table 4 shows the performance of model a and model b in predicting the overland flood extent both models predicted the flood conditions accurately with 98 of the case study area accuracy however if we narrow down the area to the surveyed flood extent model a only simulated 75 correctly while model b performed slightly better at 81 sensitivity in terms of precision only 66 and 72 of flood area simulated by model a and model b respectively was actually flooded in summary model b considered the flow processes in gullies which enabled it to simulate the interactions between ofm and sfm better and produce results that were closer to the reality 3 3 3 modelling costs for model b extra information regarding gullies were required for setting up such detailed data are often difficult or and expensive to obtain which is also the main reason why most modelling approaches ignore these elements luckily in the study we received the information from the taipei city government s field survey data for areas where the surveyed data were absent we adopted the city government s storm sewer design standard to set up the inlets and gullies along the road sides in model b table 5 compares the computing time of both models a and b running on the same desktop computer with intel i7 8700 3 7g cpu and 32 gb ram as expected model b required more time for calculating the flow in gullies nevertheless the extra 1d sfm computing cost was relatively small comparing to the 2d ofm part such that only 1 2 3 4 additional cost was incurred to provide better modelling results 4 conclusions in this study we proposed an improved mixed ofm sfm and sfm ofm coupling approach for urban flood modelling by considering the flow process through gullies which is often ignored in most ofm sfm or sfm ofm coupling approaches such detailed process may change the flow dynamic in sewer network and consequently affect the predictions of flood locations and extents the proposed approach allows better description of the flow dynamic between overland and sewer system flows the comparisons with the observed water level hydrographs and flood extent in the case study demonstrated that models a and b can provide reliable modelling results for both moderate and extreme weather conditions which allows flood risk managers to identify hotspots for developing mitigation measures acknowledgments the research is partially funded by the sinatra project

7403,in coupled sewer and surface flood modelling approaches the flow process in gullies is often ignored although the overland flow is drained to sewer network via inlets and gullies therefore the flow entering inlets is transferred to the sewer network immediately which may lead to a different flood estimation than the reality in this paper we compared two modelling approach with and without considering the flow processes in gullies in the coupled sewer and surface modelling three historical flood events were adopted for model calibration and validation the results showed that the inclusion of flow process in gullies can further improve the accuracy of urban flood modelling keywords coupled 1d 2d flood model dynamic flow interaction model comparison overland flow roof drainage storm sewer flow 1 introduction flooding is a major hazard in many urban areas that leads to significant damage to properties and disruption of services hydraulic modelling is the key for better understanding of flood dynamic such that enhanced adaptation measures can be applied for disaster risk reduction drr for most modern cities storm sewer networks are built to manage surface water caused by local rainfall however the cost for the construction and maintenance of drainage networks is expensive such that a standard between 1 in 1and 1 in 30 years balmforth et al 2006 bloomberg and strickland 2012 bsi 2008 ciwem udg 2016 is often used for designing sewer systems to evaluate the consequence of flooding due to extreme weather conditions that are beyond the design standard one dimensional 1d sewer flow models sfms are widely adopted to examine the performance of drainage systems for dealing with intense rainfall arnbjerg nielsen 2008 rossman 2010 to better describe the movement of surcharge flow from sewer networks instead of using simplified depth volume functions overland flow models ofms are introduced to simulate the runoff dynamic on the ground surface the approach coupling of sfm and ofm is regarded as the dual drainage approach djordjević et al 1999 that can be either a combination of 1d sfm and 1d ofm leandro et al 2009 or a combination of 1d sfm and two dimensional 2d ofm chen et al 2007 hsu et al 2002 each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages allitt et al 2009 in the last decade coupled 1d sfm and 2d ofm have been widely applied to urban flood modelling jahanbazi and egger 2014 russo et al 2015 seyoum et al 2012 vojinovic and tutulic 2009 recently leandro and martins 2016 coupled 2d ofm with 1d sfm swmm 5 1 using dynamic link libraries that avoids changing the source code in swmm martins et al 2017 compared three approaches that were all coupled to the same 1d sfm to analyse the differences in modelling results using the full shallow water equations the local inertial equations and the diffusive wave equations as the 2d ofm in our previous study chang et al 2015 we compared six combinations of 1d sfm and 2d ofm in urban flood modelling including 1 2d ofm only 2 2d ofm with rainfall reduction or infiltration rate 3 combined sfm ofm 4 coupled sfm ofm 5 coupled ofm sfm and 6 mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling details of these modelling approaches are provided in chang et al 2015 the results showed that the bidirectional interaction between the sewer network and the ground surface must be included in modelling to provide more accurate estimations i e approaches 4 6 furthermore the interaction between the two systems may vary because different land cover conditions have different mechanisms for example if rainfall on a flat roof is collected and drained directly to the sewer network then the downstream network may surcharge due to high discharge into the system and the coupled sfm ofm approach is adequate to simulate the condition that the sewer flow returns to the surface on the other hand the excess runoff from the precipitation falling on pervious area may propagate along terrain until reaching an inlet that drains the overland flow into the sewer system which is better reflected by the coupled ofm sfm approach for coping with real world problems that are often a combination of these two situations the mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling was therefore developed as a solution chang et al 2015 sewer inlets are the main interface introducing surface runoff into underground drainage network nevertheless in hydraulic modelling this process is often simplified or neglected because the details of input data required the recent improvement of data availability has enabled the possibility to analyse the flow behaviour through inlets and their influence in flood modelling shepherd et al 2012 assess the performance of road gullies through a systematic numerical modelling bazin et al 2014 and chen et al 2016 investigated how the flow regime through inlet and manhole changes under different flow conditions and proposed a set of methods to calculate the discharge djordjević et al 2012 and martins et al 2014 adopted the computational fluid dynamics cfd model openfoam to simulate the flow interaction through a gully which was compared to laboratory measurements different laboratory gullies and openfoam settings were employed in these two studies gomez et al 2016 compared the numerical modelling results using flow 3d with the experimental data to evaluate the inlet coefficient lopes et al 2016 also adopted similar approach to estimate the efficiency of gully with grate slots in this study we developed an innovative approach to better simulate the function of inlets during flood events which was compared to the above mentioned methods against the measurements in both underground and overland systems of three historical events the models were calibrated and validated via three flood events with different attributes i e constant moderate rainfall with long duration intense rainfall with short duration and extreme rainfall with short duration the results showed the need to incorporate the new methodology to further improve of modelling accuracy in the mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling approach 2 methodology 2 1 2d ofm we adopted and 2d non inertia ofm to simulate the flood propagation on the ground surface the 2d ofm is coupled with the storm water management model swmm huber and dickinson 1988 version 4 4 to simulate the bidirectional interactions between the overland and the sewer systems both 2d ofm and swmm4 4 are developed in fortran hence they are coupled and compiled as a single code assuming the local and

derivation of finite difference method for the 2d ofm was depicted in hsu et al 2000 2 2 interaction between ofm and sfm without gullies as mentioned earlier we have developed six approaches in an earlier study of urban flood modelling chang et al 2015 two of the approaches only involve with 2d ofm and no interaction with 1d sfm is considered the combined sfm ofm approach runs the 1d sfm to determine the surcharge discharges from the sewer network which are used as point sources in the 2d ofm this is a unidirectional interaction where the surface runoff cannot return to the sewer even when the drainage capacity is available for the coupled sfm ofm or ofm sfm approaches the interaction between the sfm and ofm is bidirectional such that the runoff can move between the sewer network

situation of this event was in between the other two events and only a minor surface flooding occurred such that the event was used for model calibration the convective rainfall event on 19 july 2015 dumped 23 mm rainfall in the case study area while 15 5 mm concentrated within 20 min as shown in fig 6 a the rainfall intensity was below the design rainfall 78 5 mm h so the sewer networks were able to convey runoff without operating the pumping stations on 23 july 2015 the area was hit by another storm that brought 125 mm rainfall within 2 h as shown in fig 7 a with 62 mm concentrated during the peak 30 min the sewer networks were unable to cope with such intense rainfall and flooding occurred in several locations both events which represent moderate and extreme conditions respectively have complete water level records at the outlets and the wl gauge in the sewer networks so that we adopted the records to validate the modelling results 3 3 modelling results 3 3 1 model calibration the modelled water levels at the detention pools of network outlets and the wl gauge using the two mixed sfm ofm and ofm sfm coupling approaches i e model a and model b without and with considering the flow processes in gullies respectively of the 7 8 august 2015 event are compared to the observation records in fig 8 the peak water levels at the wl gauge were following the peaks of the change of rainfall intensity the results from both models a and b captured the trend properly with only slight overestimation during the peaks the water levels in the detention pools at the outlets from both models were very similar for all four networks the water level at network 4 outlet fig 8 e varied almost simultaneously with the changes of rainfall intensity with a 10 15 min delay because the catchment is relatively small and the location of the outlet is very close to the tes gauge the river water level quickly rose above the water level in the detention pool such that the pump operation played an important role in managing the water level four pumps were switched on when the water level at the pool exceeded 0 95 m 0 97 m 1 0 m and 1 02 m respectively the pumps were operating until the water level reduced to 0 18 m 0 31 m 0 31 m and 0 35 m respectively when the pumps were running the water level at the pool was dominated by the operation of pumps rather than the rainfall the same conditions apply to the water level hydrograph at the network 3 outlet pool fig 8 d due to the larger catchment areas and the longer distances of main trunks the water levels at outlets of networks 1 and 2 varied less significantly with the changes of rainfall intensity than the ones in networks 3 and 4 the water level at network 1 outlet pool fig 8 b increased until 01 50 when the river water level exceeded than the pool water level so the pump station began operation after 05 00 the water level dropped quickly as the result of reduced rainfall and the continuous operation of the pumping station similar responses can be found at the network 2 outlet pool fig 8 c the water level changes at the wl gauge fig 8 a and the variation of the hydrograph at the network 2 outlet pool fig 8 c show the backwater effect from the downstream therefore the relationship between the rainfall intensity and the water level at the wl gauge was not obvious the parameters to be calibrated were the roughness in both the 2d ofm and the 1d sfm the parameters were adjusted based on land cover types and pipe diameters and slopes and calibrated until the modelled water level hydrographs at all locations were consistent with the observed ones i e nse was close to 1 the roughness values were determined as 1 0 02 for roads plazas pavements etc 2 0 08 for green lands parks etc and 3 0 05 for built up areas the range of roughness of pipes was 0 013 0 018 in general model a predicted slightly higher water level than model b did especially for the peak values the nses shown in table 1 indicate that model b performed better than model a for the wl gauge and all networks 3 3 2 model validation fig 9 compares the observed and modelled water level hydrographs at the network outlets and the wl gauge of 19 july 2015 event the rainfall was not intense and long enough to result in high river levels and to trigger the operation of pumping stations the records show that the water level at the wl gauge fig 9 a increased rapidly right after the rainfall started and reached to the peak level with a 15 min lag to the peak rainfall this reflected the time of concentration at the node for collecting the surface runoff from its subcatchment after the rainfall stopped the water level gradually decreased because the coming discharge from further upstream pipes kept the water level high both models a and b produced very similar changing trend but with 0 08 m and 0 06 m over estimation of the peak level respectively for the water levels at the outlets the outer water levels dropped below than the ones in pools such that pumping stations were not activated the sewer flows were slowly discharged to the rivers by gravity which was also reflected in the slow declining water level at the wl gauge table 2 show the nses of the modelled water level hydrographs compared to the observations apart from the outlet of network 2 which both models produced perfect predictions model b performed better than model a for all locations the reason for the perfect predictions was that the event was very short such that only limited observation records can be compared to fig 10 compares the observation and modelled water level at the network outlets and the wl gauge of 23 july event the wl gauge records show that the water level increased rapidly right after the rainfall started and stayed at a constant peak level because the full capacity of the network has been reached the situation lasted for an hour because the coming discharge from further upstream pipes kept the water level high then the water level started to decrease 30 min after the rainfall intensity has become lower than the design rainfall intensity fig 10 a shows that model a has faster rising and declining limbs of the water level than model b it was due to that the flow response time in the gullies was not considered in model a such that the surface water entered the sewer network more quickly for the receding part the water level in model a began to decrease at eight minutes earlier than the observation while the model b result showed a slower timing and pace of water receding it was due to that model b was able to capture more surface water through gully inlets from the upstream catchments such that the water level maintained higher than model a for longer the water levels at network outlets rapidly increased when the rainfall intensity was above the design rainfall the operation of pumping station 1 quickly reduced the water level from 13 50 in general the water level in model b increased at a slower rate because the flow process in gullies was considered that the runoff collected from inlets reached to the manhole later than the one in model a which assumes that the runoff moves from inlets to manhole immediately this led to a slower rate of overland flow entering the sewer network which resulted in later water level increase in the rising part of the hydrograph in sewer network and a lower discharge of the surcharge flow downstream consequently more water volume stayed in the sewer network such that the water level took longer time to recede which can be observed in the water level hydrographs for other networks the pumps began operating around 13 20 because the continuous rainfall in previous 30 min has increased the water levels at the detention pools at wl gauge a at the outlet detention pools of networks 1 4 b e respectively table 3 shows the nses of the modelled water level hydrographs compared to the observations clearly model b performed better than model a for all locations although the pumping stations managed to cope with the flow concentrating to the outlets the upstream pipes of the networks were unable to convey all inflow such that surcharge occurred as discussed earlier about the condition at the wl gauge fig 11 and fig 12 compare the modelled flood extents to the surveyed one which was investigated by taipei city government after the event for model a and b respectively the field survey was carried out on the basis of road sections such that the flood extents were delineated along the roads as a result the mapped extent may be slightly inconsistent to the real flood situations unfortunately there was no detailed flood depth information attached such that it was not possible to compare the modelled flood depth to the observation the flood extent in the subcatchments nearby the wl gauge in model a was smaller than in model b but the simulated flood extents from both models were close to the surveyed one the negligence of the flow process in gullies allowed overland flow to enter the upstream manhole more easily such that the modelled flood extent was smaller in this area same situation occurred in the upstream area of network 4 i e the flood extent near the bottom boundary where model a simulated a smaller flood extent than model b because the model setting collected more surface runoff from nearby region for network 3 the increased upstream flow in model a led to a greater flood extent along the main road in the east subcatchment the long road spans the upstream subcatchments of four branches the flooding in model a was due to the surcharge water from the second bottom branch that the higher flow in the main trunk affected the runoff entering from this branch the surcharged water propagated along the main road and flowed southward due to the terrain configuration in model b the gullies could not drain the runoff in the northern part on the same road such that more flooding in that area was simulated nevertheless it reduced the downstream pipe flow such that simulated flood extent in the midstream area in model b was smaller than in model a table 4 shows the performance of model a and model b in predicting the overland flood extent both models predicted the flood conditions accurately with 98 of the case study area accuracy however if we narrow down the area to the surveyed flood extent model a only simulated 75 correctly while model b performed slightly better at 81 sensitivity in terms of precision only 66 and 72 of flood area simulated by model a and model b respectively was actually flooded in summary model b considered the flow processes in gullies which enabled it to simulate the interactions between ofm and sfm better and produce results that were closer to the reality 3 3 3 modelling costs for model b extra information regarding gullies were required for setting up such detailed data are often difficult or and expensive to obtain which is also the main reason why most modelling approaches ignore these elements luckily in the study we received the information from the taipei city government s field survey data for areas where the surveyed data were absent we adopted the city government s storm sewer design standard to set up the inlets and gullies along the road sides in model b table 5 compares the computing time of both models a and b running on the same desktop computer with intel i7 8700 3 7g cpu and 32 gb ram as expected model b required more time for calculating the flow in gullies nevertheless the extra 1d sfm computing cost was relatively small comparing to the 2d ofm part such that only 1 2 3 4 additional cost was incurred to provide better modelling results 4 conclusions in this study we proposed an improved mixed ofm sfm and sfm ofm coupling approach for urban flood modelling by considering the flow process through gullies which is often ignored in most ofm sfm or sfm ofm coupling approaches such detailed process may change the flow dynamic in sewer network and consequently affect the predictions of flood locations and extents the proposed approach allows better description of the flow dynamic between overland and sewer system flows the comparisons with the observed water level hydrographs and flood extent in the case study demonstrated that models a and b can provide reliable modelling results for both moderate and extreme weather conditions which allows flood risk managers to identify hotspots for developing mitigation measures acknowledgments the research is partially funded by the sinatra project

7404,despite advancements in developing physics based formulations to estimate the sheet flow travel time t shf the quantification of the relative impacts of influential parameters on t shf has not previously been considered in this study a brief review of the physics based formulations to estimate t shf including kinematic wave k w theory in combination with manning s roughness k m and with darcy weisbach friction formula k d over single and multiple planes is provided then the relative significance of input parameters to the developed approaches is quantified by a density based global sensitivity analysis gsa the performance of k m considering zero upstream and uniform flow depth so called k m1 and k m2 and k d formulae to estimate the t shf over single plane surface were assessed using several sets of experimental data collected from the previous studies the compatibility of the developed models to estimate t shf over multiple planes considering temporal rainfall distributions of natural resources conservation service nrcs i ia ii and iii are scrutinized by several real world examples the results obtained demonstrated that the main controlling parameters of t shf through k d and k m formulae are the length of surface plane mean sensitivity index t i 0 72 and flow resistance mean t i 0 52 respectively conversely the flow temperature and initial abstraction ratio of rainfall have the lowest influence on t shf mean t i is 0 11 and 0 12 respectively the significant role of the flow regime on the estimation of t shf over a single and a cascade of planes are also demonstrated results reveal that the k d formulation provides more precise t shf over the single plane surface with an average percentage of error ape equal to 9 23 the ape for k m1 and k m2 formulae were 13 8 and 36 33 respectively the superiority of manning jointed formulae in estimation of t shf is due to the incorporation of effects from different flow regimes as flow moves downgradient that

shf is defined as the time that excess rainfall originated from rainfall snowmelt and saturation excess on the soil surface moves from the furthest segment of the drainage path which is located immediately downstream from the drainage divide line to the nearest stream or becomes shallow concentrated flow nrcs 1986 yamoto and islam 1992 this compartment contributes an important part of the time of concentration of watershed to develop the unit hydrograph froehlich 2011 and selecting the design storm intensity for estimation of watershed peak outflow bondelid et al 1982 almost all hydrologic analyses and modelling require the value of time response characteristics as input mccuen et al 1984 paniconi and putti 2015 t shf compared with the other compartments of time of concentration of watershed i e shallow concentrated and stream flow is likely to be the dominant component for small watersheds parking lots rooftops highways airport runways artificially constructed wetlands agricultural plots and lawns singh 2002 and at t shf the same time is the most theoretically questionable of the three compartments dewberry 2003 these challenges arise mainly from non homogeneity in land cover and land use as major characteristics of micro and partly urbanized watersheds that certainly affect the sheet flow properties i e travel time and flow depth developed formulations to estimate are an important step to partially compensate for this challenge since lighthill and whitham 1955 t shf and thereafter miller and gunge 1975 showed that inertial and pressure forces are not important for overland flow during storm events due to the domination of the bed slope term in the motion equation an increasing number of applications of the kinematic wave k w theory are reported for developing physics based formulations for accurate and efficient estimation of over single overton and meadows 1976 scs 1986 wong and chen 1997 or multiple continuous planes e g kibler and woolhiser 1970 wong 1996 whereas successive progressions were obtained by combining the k w theory with the manning s resistance formulation k m to estimate over a single plane nrcs 1986

diverged hillslope campbell et al 1984 and complex shaped hillslope sabzevari et al 2013 and watershed geometry and leaf shape water geometry agiralioglu 1985 however this formulation was limited to turbulent or near turbulent sheet flow regime over the whole surface plane further simplifications accompanied by the k w approach are ignoring the effects of momentum t shf due to sheet flow and rain langford and turner 1973 and considering one dimensional sheet flow and uniform distribution of rainfall over the plane surface as sheet flow is characterized by a small hydraulic radius i e flow depth and slow velocity at the upgradient n region the flow regime should not be considered fully turbulent over the surface plane bulter 1977 combining k w theory with the darcy weisbach friction formulation k d incorporates the effect of different f flow regime laminar transitional and turbulent to estimate singh 1988 wong and chen 1997 field and laboratory studies on seem to use the k d equation whilst the k m equation is frequently used for channel flow abrahams et al 1994 however selecting the type of equation for estimation of appears to be much more influenced by personal preference rather than the real properties of sheet flow probably one of the reasons that hydrologists tend to use k m rather than k d is the lack of data sources for manning s roughness coefficient compared with the darcy weisbach coefficient f and also the uncertainties in values for different flow regimes and surfaces grismer 2016 the input parameters for these formulations can be categorized as 1 physical properties of the plane surface including soil type land use land cover surface slope flow resistance roughness and length of surface in direction of flow and 2 storm and weather conditions including the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall intensity average daily rainfall temperature and initial abstractions related to climate conditions however previous works report that the parameters which have the dominant influence upon t shf in the catchment are length slope roughness and flow regime e g wooding 1965 no attempt has been made to systematically and quantitatively indicate the relative impact of these influential parameters on the t shf in addition applications of developed models have been mainly limited to hypothetical examples that did not fully match with real world t shf conditions to fill these gaps the main objective of this study is to obtain the relative influence of input parameters of kinematic wave based formulations to estimate by a density based global sensitivity analysis gsa for the first time an integrated assessment of the developed formulations to estimate the t shf and the degree of conformity of their results with experimental data and also practical conditions are scrutinized for the first time by considering a single plane the overall flowchart of the research methodology is shown in fig 1 the performance of the developed formulae to estimate the are also assessed through multiple continuous planes by using numerous real world systems of hillslope riparian stream hydrologic connectivity where the temporal variation of rainfall intensity is also considered a brief review of the k w based formulations on the estimation of t shf is given in the next section 2 research background for over single and multiple planar surfaces the kinematic wave k w model in addition to the diffusion full and steady dynamic and gravity wave models is a distinctive approximation of the saint venant equation ponce and simons 1977 according to table 1 the k w model is based on the continuity equation and only approximates the dynamic equation so that the friction slope is parallel to the bed slope miller 1983 the k w gives a valid approximation for hydraulics of one dimensional shallow unsteady and uniform flow travelling down across planar or wide surfaces in the absence of backwater effects

distance along the plane in flow direction l the right hand side of eq 1 can be replaced by the average excess rainfall intensity i e e g singh 2001 garcía serrana et al 2017 the k w model uses the continuity and simplified form of the motion equation such that the friction slope is equal to the bed slope and therefore does not change with flow conditions the k w approximation which also denotes the quasi steady condition wooding 1965 is also valid when the froude number of sheet flow is less than or equal to two fr 2 miller 1983 the equation of motion states that the lateral inflow q is related to flow depth y only by using two coefficients α and β in eq 2 under the assumption that the hydraulic radius of sheet flow r h l equal to y eagleson 1970 singh 2001 2 q α y β where α is a

greater travelling time by a factor of 1 4 but it is more realistic and coincides with real cases as flow depth or flow velocity v lt 1 increases as flow travels to the downstream of the surface such that the maximum depth or occur at downstream edge of surface y x l y max v x l v max applying uniform flow depth over the surface assumed identical flow velocity over the planar surface which is

zero upstream flow condition and therefore flow depth growth implies a changing flow regime from laminar at the upstream edge through transitional at the middle distance to turbulent flow at the

estimate t shf despite numerous studies successfully applying the k w theory for modelling overland flow woolhiser and liggett 1967 derived a criterion referred to as the kinematic wave number η for judging the goodness of the k w approximation in modelling of sheet flow over a sloping plane 13 η sl yfr 2 all variables in eq 13 are defined previously substituting fr v gy eq 13 reduces to 14 η sgl v 2 woolhiser and liggett 1967 indicated that for η 50 the k w approximation would be very good replacing g 9 81 ms 2 in eq 14 sl v 2 should be 2 04 to have good approximation with k w theory units of v and l are ms 1 and m respectively which is valid for sheet flow over numerous natural surfaces therefore the criterion of η needs to check only for smooth surfaces in which applying the k w theory may produce a crude approximation for example in urban surfaces η may be below 20 another goodness of fit criteria was suggested by mccuen and spiess 1995 which implies that the k w assumption should be limited to the kinematic wave number n k w nl s 100 2 2 estimation of excess rainfall intensity in eqs 9 to 12 ie is the average excess rainfall intensity for the storm with duration equal to tt d t t therefore repeated solution of these equations are required to find an appropriate value of d that is equal to tt to eliminate this repetition problem chen and evan 1977 proposed the use of an intensity duration relation i d in the form of i a d b where a and b are regional constants in the manning formula eq 12 average rainfall intensity i is related to i e by a runoff coefficient c through the rational formula of ie c i asce 1992 welle and woodward 1986 used i d relations for two nrcs standard design storms type ii and iii in the form of i a p 24 d b where p 24 is 24 h rainfall depth in mm and constants a and b are 5 7 and 0 62 for storm type ii and 4 76 and 0 63 for storm type iii respectively the nrcs design storms i ia ii and iii are characterized by an intense rainfall period somewhere near the middle and lesser rainfall intensities at the beginning and end of the storm and have been applied to very large geographic regions cronshey and woodward 1989 for instance the type ii distribution has been applied to a large part of the central continental united states and type ia has been used in the pacific northwest scs 1973 tr 55 model uses a modified form of the

average excess rainfall intensity ie for different temporal rainfall distributions of nrcs 2 3 multiple planar surfaces in the previous section the approaches for estimation of t shf over a plane surface are presented in which the input parameters e g slope and roughness are homogeneous over the surface this condition is more consistent with sheet flow that occurs in the furthest upstream segment of the drainage path or across the street in an urban area commonly sheet flow from a wooded area may flow onto a dense grass covered surface which may then discharge onto a paved surface such as a driveway and continue over the rangeland or turf as shown in fig 3 each of these surfaces has a different resistance to flow or roughness and hydraulic radius and may differ in slope and infiltration thus equations that assume a single section that is homogeneous in land cover hydraulic radius and roughness i e one used in tr 55 cannot be applied mccuen and okunola 2002 the assumptions of zero upstream boundary conditions qu 0 and uniform flow distribution q u q d behind eq 12 that lead to these formulae cannot be applied precisely for the cascade of surface planes for a multi planar flow path with n planes in which flow from an upgradient plane discharges onto the next down gradient plane eqs 912 and 1517 should be extended wong 1996 derived the kinematic wave and manning formula for estimation of tshf for a series of planes the general form of tshf formulation for cascade of n planes is as follows 18 t shf j 1 n l j α j 1 β j m 1 j i e m l m 1 β j m 1 j 1 i e m l m 1 β j m 1 j i e m l m m 1 j 1 i e m l m where j is index for planes in direction of sheet flow eq 18 is based on the assumption that downstream outflow of one plane becomes the inflow to the adjacent plane downstream without backwater condition and all surfaces contribute in runoff generation replacing the values of α and β from eqs 3 a c corresponding to the flow regime in each section reduces eq 18 to a kinematic wave approximation the manning expression for estimation of the tshf over continuous multi planar surface for turbulent or near turbulent flow regimes so called k m3 can be obtained with parameters α and β from eq 4 employed in eq 18 as follows 19 t shf j 1 n 6 988 l j n j s j 0 6 m 1 j i e m l m 0 6 m 1 j 1 i e m l m 0 6 m 1 j i e m l m m 1 j 1 i e m l m 3 global sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis gsa is a useful tool in understanding the relative influences of the different sources of uncertainty e g model parameters errors in forcing data or non numerical uncertainties in the variability of the model output saltelli et al 2008 baroni and tarantola 2014 rajabi et al 2015 density based sensitivity indices dsi have become progressively widespread in gsa applications across different hydrological modelling fields e g pappenberger et al 2008 peeters et al 2014 in the dsi approach proposed by pianosi and wagener 2015 which is named pawn derived from the authors names the model output distribution for t shf is characterized by a data sample cumulative density function cdf rather than its probability density function pdf practically in the pawn indices the sensitivity to input xi is measured by the distance between the empirical unconditional cdf of output t shf f t shf t shf that is obtained when all inputs vary simultaneously and the empirical conditional cdf f t shf x i t shf that are obtained when varying all inputs but x i is fixed at a nominal value through the kolmogorov smirnov statistic ks kolmogorov 1933 20 k s x i max t shf f t shf t shf f t shf x i t shf fig 4 shows the ks obtained from the empirical unconditional and conditional cdfs the empirical unconditional cdf y f t shf t shf is approximated using n u output estimations obtained by sampling the entire input feasibility region the conditional cdf t shf f t shf x i t shf is approximated using n c output estimations obtained by sampling the non fixed inputs only while the value of x i is kept fix as statistics ks depends on the value at which xi fixed the index t i considers the maximum values of t i over all possible values of x i pianosi and wagener 2015 21 t i max x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n ks x i where x i 1 hatx i 2 hatx i n are randomly sampled values for the fixed input x i the lower value of t i t i 0 1 indicates the

are the number of samples to estimate the unconditional cdf conditional cdf and condition points respectively the proper values for n n u and n c can be selected by trial and error to follow regularity properties of cdfs continuity monotonicity relative smoothness the index t i is a global model independent robust quantitative dimensionless with no need for parameter tuning no computing costs for computing the cdf easy to implement facilitates the application of bootstrapping and convergence analysis and is unconditional on any assumed input value pianosi et al 2015 in this study the

p rainfall duration d average rainfall depth p 24 runoff coefficient c and length of plane surface l are calculated using eq 8 whereas the input parameters related to nrcs storm characteristics are considered according to froehlich 2009 the index t i is a helpful tool to investigate the relative influence of model parameters on predictive accuracy as well as to understand the dominant factors which control the precision of t shf 4 results and discussion the cumulative density function cdf of f t shf t shf and f t shf x i t shf for the model output t shf for the wide range of eight influenced parameters of k m formulation with zero upstream boundary condition n s d p λ cn p 24 l and also for nine effective parameters of k d formulation t f s d p λ cn p 24 l are computed the results are not shown the cdfs of all parameters grow significantly away from their initial uniform distributions but in different ways which lead to different sensitivity to these parameters the sensitivity index of ks x i for the influential parameters in the estimation of t shf by k d and k m formulations are shown in fig 5 where α 0 05 n 10 n u 100 and n c 50 in both formulations the effect of the temporal distribution of storm intensity is investigated by incorporating four temporal rainfall distributions of nrcs the values of ks x i indicate that the storm occurrence time e g winter or spring are not affected by the t shf estimated by k d formula since all values of this index rely on below critical values for a wide range of the flow temperature between 2 and 45 c as shown in fig 5 a in addition the t shf estimated by both formulations of k d and k m are not significantly sensitive to the wide range of rainfall depth p ranging from 0 to 1000 mm initial abstraction ratio λ ranged 0 001 to 0 8 and also curve number cn ranging from 30 to 99 for all types of nrcs storms except to p 100 mm of nrcs type ii in k m formula fig 5 e g and m o according to eq 17 the parameters p λ and cn contribute to the calculation of runoff coefficient c which is apparently not a significantly influential parameter on t shf it should be noted that the values of ks indicate the relative influence of the corresponding parameter in comparison with other influential parameters further investigations indicate that computing the ks for the input parameters of k d and k m formulae by directly entering the parameter c into eq 16 in the range of 0 05 to 0 95 show that t shf is significantly sensitive to lower and upper values of c 0 15 or 0 80 for all nrcs storms as shown in fig 6 however the sensitivity of t shf to the lower and upper ranges of parameter c through k m formula is greater than k m according to fwha 1996 the lower values of c correspond to lawns with sandy soil and un improved natural area e g forest whereas the upper values correspondent to asphaltic and concrete area in developed urban watersheds e g rooftops parking lots and paved surfaces results of the ks corresponding to both k m and k d formulations indicate that t shf is not influenced by c over the areas with intermediate values of runoff coefficient 0 2 c 0 8 for the upper values of c the effect of temporal rainfall distribution i e nrcs storms is more dominant than for lower values the t shf is influenced by flow resistance parameter f in k d and parameter n in k m formulae for lower f 10 and n 0 22 and upper f 50 and n 0 6 values of surface roughness as shown in fig 5 b and j according to engman 1986 the lower values of n correspond to asphalt and concrete bare soil and natural rangeland areas whereas the upper values link to the surfaces covered with dense grass interestingly the sensitivity of the t shf estimated by k d and k m formulae to lower values of flow resistance is similar for four types of nrcs storms however the effect of temporal rainfall distribution is dominant for very rough surfaces the intermediate rough surfaces i e 0 2 n 0 6 do not have a significant influence on the t shf despite the dominance of temporal rainfall distribution for these surfaces surface plane slope s 10 or 6 has a significant influence on the estimation of t shf by two formulations of k m and k d fig 5 c and k this surface slope is frequently observed in natural watersheds except to steep hill slopes which may be unstable and also for the design of transverse slopes of roads fhwa 1984 5 the meaningfulness of the rainfall duration d on the t shf estimated by k m and k d formulae is limited to d 180 min or 6 hr for all types of nrcs storms storms with a duration 6 hr do not have a significant impact on the t shf due to the decreasing storm intensity according to i d relations the t shf is influenced significantly by 2 years 24 h rainfall depth for p 24 200 mm or p 24 800 mm for both formulations of k m and k d and different types of nrcs storms fig 5 h and p the range of p 24 200 mm covers the 2 years daily rainfall depth for all types of nrcs design storms in usa scs 1986 the significant effect of surface plane length l on the estimation of t shf by the k d and k m formulations is limited to about l 3500 m fig 5 i and q noting the constraint of 100 m or 300 ft for sheet flow length by tr 55 this parameter plays an important role in the t shf over a wide range of surfaces in natural and urban watersheds according to eq 18 the sensitivity index ks is calculated as the maximum value of ks over all possible values of input parameters in the k m and k d formulations see fig 7 this index can be beneficial for ranking the sensitivity of the parameters that influence t shf for different storm types results of fig 7 reveal the dominant influence of parameter l in the estimation of tshf by k m and k d formulae and also for all types of nrcs storms except in the case of nrcs type ii and k m formula where the parameter n has the greatest influence after the parameter l the order of index t i changes for k m and k d formulations and also for nrcs design storms for all types of nrcs storms the t shf estimated by k m has the minimum sensitivity to the flow temperature however the t shf estimated by both formulations indicate lower sensitivity to the parameters of the scs cn model i e λ cn and p according to eq 17 but incorporating the runoff coefficient c directly in the models results in a significant increase of t i related to this parameter 0 35 for k d and 0 4 to 0 5 for k m on average the two formulations of k d and k m consistently indicate that the plane surface characteristics i e n or f cn l and s have the greater impacts on the t shf t i 0 43 and 0 41 respectively in comparison to storm and climate characteristics i e t d λ p and p 24 t i 0 20 and 0 27 respectively for all nrcs storms the surface related parameters have a near equal influence on t shf whereas in the k m formula there is higher sensitivity to the parameters related to storm and climate in addition the order of average sensitivity of the t shf on the input parameters of k d and k m formulae are associated with the nrcs type ii t i 0 33 and 0 40 i iii and then type ia respectively table 2 summarizes the values of flow resistance coefficients τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 and n for three surfaces of grass concrete and turf used for estimation of the t shf by the four formulae which were obtained from previous experiments it should be mentioned that the values of τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 and n in table 2 are based on selected parameters e g surface slope rainfall intensity surface roughness that were adopted in the application examples the flow resistance coefficients need revision due to complicated dynamics of flow resistance caused by the influential factors saghafian and julien 1989 6 application of formulae twenty sets of experimental data covering a wide range of the influential factors i e l s i e and n on the measured t shf over a single plane surface are collected from previous studies and used to illustrate the performance of the developed formulations table 2 indicates the source experimental data observed values of t shf and also t shf values estimated using the k m formula in two conditions q u q d so called k m1 and qu 0 so called k m2 and k d formula for these experimental data the tr 55 formula cannot be used due to lack of available information of p 24 values results of table 2 indicate that the calculated goodness of fit criteria η obtained by using eq 13 or 14 and n k w indicates that all values of η and n k w are significantly greater and smaller than threshold value of 50 and 100 respectively this guarantees that the k w theory provides a very good approximation for all cases shown in table 2 considering zero upstream boundary condition assumed by k m1 formula are more realistic as flow runs over the single plane rather than the assumption of uniform flow depth all over the surface plane for this purpose the average percentage of error ape for three formulae of k m1 k m2 and k d and for different flow regimes downgradient of the surface plane are computed and shown in fig 8 this assumption resulted in a reduction of ape in the estimation of t shf as 22 17 26 27 and 18 90 for laminar transitional and turbulent flow regime respectively it is noteworthy that incorporating the darcy weisbach friction in k w theory i e k d formula outperforms k m1 and k m2 especially for laminar and turbulent sheet flow regimes however in transitional flow regime the ape values for k d and k m2 are close together 6 03 and 6 39 respectively but the k d indicates significant improvement for laminar and turbulent flow regime 6 4 and 5 67 respectively it is noteworthy that among the used experimental data the minimum ape value in the estimation of the t shf by three formulae is obtained in the cases of having the transitional and laminar flow regimes downgradient in the surface plane fig 8 three formulae have the maximum error in estimation of t shf for turbulent flow regime downgradient in the plane despite the fact that the manning based formulae i e k m1 and k m2 is based on the assumption of occurring turbulent flow regime over the whole surface plane the k d formula is also proficient i e less ape value in this flow regime condition underestimation of t shf by three formulae especially when the sheet flow regime is turbulent see the calculated values of t shf in table 2 may lead to the overestimation of peak discharge in the hydrological design these findings imply that considering one type of flow regime i e turbulent throughout the surface plane as is the case with the manning based formulae could not be relied on to coincide with the realistic hydraulic condition of sheet flow previous research works i e bulter 1977 singh 1988 chen and wong 1993 reported the inevitability of laminar or transitional flow regimes occurring before turbulent flow regime as sheet flow moves downgradient of the surface plane which leads to increasing the t shf moreover uncertainties and data scarcity of friction factor f for different flow regimes and surface types are likely reasons why t shf is underestimated by k d formula the performance of the k m and k d formulae in the estimation of t shf are also compared over hillslope riparian stream hydrologic connectivity system as multiple continuous planes mcps unfortunately no previous experimental data is available to assess the t shf over mcps for the purpose of intercomparison of two k m and k d formulae a continuous cascade of three surfaces are assumed as a grassy surface at up gradient plane covered by kentucky blue grass a smooth surface at middle plane e g rooftops parking lot and paved surfaces such as streets and a slightly rough surface i e turf at down gradient plane for the real world application of the results the surface planes and storm and climate characteristics in these examples were collected from the previous studies the effect of temporal distributions of rainfall is also investigated by considering four nrcs type i ia ii and iii the flow resistance parameters τ 1 τ 2 and τ 3 manning s roughness coefficient n and runoff coefficient c of three considered surfaces are given in table 2 these parameters are kept constant for the corresponding surfaces in all analysis the values of t shf by two formulae k m and k d are calculated by considering numerous sets of input parameters some of the results are shown in table 4 for each case the percentage of turbulent flow portion on the three surfaces and the absolute difference of two formulations in the estimation of t shf are also calculated and given in table 4 results shown in table 4 can be summarized as follows 1 in all cases the estimated values of t shf by the k d formula are greater than those obtained by the k m3 approach due to incorporating the effects of three flow regimes laminar transitional and turbulent in k d formula instead of turbulent flow only longer t shf leads to delaying the time of peak flow and thus changes the shape of the unit hydrograph obtained by two formulae 2 a significant inverse correlation between the difference of k m3 and k d results and the portion of turbulent flow regime over the surfaces of planes is observed when the nrcs storm type i ii and iii is considered a weak correlation between two formulations of k d and k m3 is observed when the nrcs storm type ia is applied 3 changing the sheet flow temperature due to weather conditions and rainy season affects the t shf estimated by k d formula whereas the k m3 formula cannot incorporate the changes in flow temperature this is one of the disadvantages of manning based formulations 4 the estimated values of t shf over multi planar surfaces by k d and k m3 formulae are also affected by the sequence of the planes if the sequence of planes in the sheet flow direction is grassy area concrete turf g c t the t shf obtained by the k d and also k m3 formulae are different from other surface arrangement e g g t c or c t g the gradual increase of flow resistance or decrease of runoff coefficient in direction of sheet flow over the cascade of surface planes leads to the two formulations giving close results and less travel time than other sequences of surfaces see rows 1 8 and 9 in table 3 5 the calculated values of the t shf through nrcs storm type ia and type ii produces the maximum and minimum values of t shf respectively 6 since the tr 55 formula uses 2 years p 24 for the excess rainfall intensity i e the same results are estimated using this formula when p 24 is constant even if rainfall intensities change significantly i e different nrcs storms 7 conclusion for small watersheds in which sheet flow is the major contributor or possibly the only contributor to the time of concentration of watershed the difference in estimation of t shf made when using various k w based formulations likely have a considerable influence on peak flow estimation and hence the appropriate design of drainage structures the results obtained from gsa demonstrated that the main controlling parameters of t shf over the single plane and cascade of multiple planes estimated by k m and k d formulae are flow resistance length of the surface plane surface slope and excess rainfall intensity conversely the lowest sensitivity of t shf in k d formula is to flow viscosity this implies t shf is not affected by the weather temperature if the other influential parameters are kept constant results of this study indicate that the kinematic darcy weisbach formulation k d outperforms the kinematic manning k m formula in the estimation of t shf due to the fact that it considers the variations of flow regime on the surface plane the developed formulae in this study maybe serve in the structure of stormwater hydrological models e g tr 55 and hydrocad to have appropriate estimation of t shf in urban and small watersheds and therefore increase confidence in design peak discharge and drainage structure sizes for the required level of risk despite the fact that a more precise estimation of t shf would be obtained using the k d formula over the single plane surface of the lack of available data and also uncertainties associated with the friction factor f for different flow regimes and surface roughness is a significant challenge with the application of this formula overestimation of peak discharge may occur in hydrological forecasting and design due to use of shorter estimates of t shf estimated by both manning and darcy weisbach based formulae the estimated t shf by two formulations of kinematic manning k m3 and k d over the cascade of continuous planes is also affected by the sequence of the planes due to change in upstream flow boundary condition the kinematic wave approximation of saint venant equations obtained by the method of characteristics is analytic computationally efficient considers the effects of flow regime over multiple planes and accurate rainfall intensity in estimation of travel time of sheet flow in one dimension more accurate results can be obtained with employing a physically based fully distributed numerical model that are more realistic avoiding the simplifications considering the spatial heterogeneity of data and also the effect of more flow components i e

7404,despite advancements in developing physics based formulations to estimate the sheet flow travel time t shf the quantification of the relative impacts of influential parameters on t shf has not previously been considered in this study a brief review of the physics based formulations to estimate t shf including kinematic wave k w theory in combination with manning s roughness k m and with darcy weisbach friction formula k d over single and multiple planes is provided then the relative significance of input parameters to the developed approaches is quantified by a density based global sensitivity analysis gsa the performance of k m considering zero upstream and uniform flow depth so called k m1 and k m2 and k d formulae to estimate the t shf over single plane surface were assessed using several sets of experimental data collected from the previous studies the compatibility of the developed models to estimate t shf over multiple planes considering temporal rainfall distributions of natural resources conservation service nrcs i ia ii and iii are scrutinized by several real world examples the results obtained demonstrated that the main controlling parameters of t shf through k d and k m formulae are the length of surface plane mean sensitivity index t i 0 72 and flow resistance mean t i 0 52 respectively conversely the flow temperature and initial abstraction ratio of rainfall have the lowest influence on t shf mean t i is 0 11 and 0 12 respectively the significant role of the flow regime on the estimation of t shf over a single and a cascade of planes are also demonstrated results reveal that the k d formulation provides more precise t shf over the single plane surface with an average percentage of error ape equal to 9 23 the ape for k m1 and k m2 formulae were 13 8 and 36 33 respectively the superiority of manning jointed formulae in estimation of t shf is due to the incorporation of effects from different flow regimes as flow moves downgradient that is affected by one or more factors including high excess rainfall intensities low flow resistance high degrees of imperviousness long surfaces steep slope and domination of rainfall distribution as

shf is defined as the time that excess rainfall originated from rainfall snowmelt and saturation excess on the soil surface moves from the furthest segment of the drainage path which is located immediately downstream from the drainage divide line to the nearest stream or becomes shallow concentrated flow nrcs 1986 yamoto and islam 1992 this compartment contributes an important part of the time of concentration of watershed to develop the unit hydrograph froehlich 2011 and selecting the design storm intensity for estimation of watershed peak outflow bondelid et al 1982 almost all hydrologic analyses and modelling require the value of time response characteristics as input mccuen et al 1984 paniconi and putti 2015 t shf compared with the other compartments of time of concentration of watershed i e shallow concentrated and stream flow is likely to be the dominant component for small watersheds parking lots rooftops highways airport runways artificially constructed wetlands agricultural plots and lawns singh 2002 and at t shf the same time is the most theoretically questionable of the three compartments dewberry 2003 these challenges arise mainly from non homogeneity in land cover and land use as major characteristics of micro and partly urbanized watersheds that certainly affect the sheet flow properties i e travel time and flow depth developed formulations to estimate are an important step to partially compensate for this challenge since lighthill and whitham 1955 t shf and thereafter miller and gunge 1975 showed that inertial and pressure forces are not important for overland flow during storm events due to the domination of the bed slope term in the motion equation an increasing number of applications of the kinematic wave k w theory are reported for developing physics based formulations for accurate and efficient estimation of over single overton and meadows 1976 scs 1986 wong and chen 1997 or multiple continuous planes e g kibler and woolhiser 1970 wong 1996 whereas successive progressions were obtained by combining the k w theory with the manning s resistance formulation k m to estimate over a single plane nrcs 1986 asce 1992 overton and meadows 1976 froehlich 2011 two planes in v shape geometry eagleson 1972 singh 1996 multiple plane surfaces brakensiek 1967 mccuen and okunola 2002 converged hillslope veal 1966

turbulent or near turbulent sheet flow regime over the whole surface plane further simplifications accompanied by the k w approach are ignoring the effects of momentum t shf due to sheet flow and rain langford and turner 1973 and considering one dimensional sheet flow and uniform distribution of rainfall over the plane surface as sheet flow is characterized by a small hydraulic radius i e flow depth and slow velocity at the upgradient n region the flow regime should not be considered fully turbulent over the surface plane bulter 1977 combining k w theory with the darcy weisbach friction formulation k d incorporates the effect of different f flow regime laminar transitional and turbulent to estimate singh 1988 wong and chen 1997 field and laboratory studies on seem to use the k d equation whilst the k m equation is frequently used for channel flow abrahams et al 1994 however selecting the type of equation for estimation of appears to be much more influenced by personal preference rather than the real properties of sheet flow probably one of the reasons that hydrologists tend to use k m rather than k d is the lack of data sources for manning s roughness coefficient compared with the darcy weisbach coefficient f and also the uncertainties in values for different flow regimes and surfaces grismer 2016 the input parameters for these formulations can be categorized as 1 physical properties of the plane surface including soil type land use land cover surface slope flow resistance roughness and length of surface in direction of flow and 2 storm and weather conditions including the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall intensity average daily rainfall temperature and initial abstractions related to climate conditions however previous works report that the parameters which have the dominant influence upon t shf in the catchment are length slope roughness and flow regime e g wooding 1965 no attempt has been made to systematically and quantitatively indicate the relative impact of these influential parameters on the t shf in addition applications of developed models have been mainly limited to hypothetical examples that did not fully match with real world t shf conditions to fill these gaps the main objective of this study is to obtain the relative influence of input parameters of kinematic wave based formulations to estimate by a density based global sensitivity analysis gsa for the first time an integrated assessment of the developed formulations to estimate the t shf and the degree of conformity of their results with experimental data and also practical conditions are scrutinized for the first time by considering a single plane the overall flowchart of the research methodology is shown in fig 1 the performance of the developed formulae to estimate the are also assessed through multiple continuous planes by using numerous real world systems of hillslope riparian stream hydrologic connectivity where the temporal variation of rainfall intensity is also considered a brief review of the k w based formulations on the estimation of t shf is given in the next section 2 research background for over single and multiple planar surfaces the kinematic wave k w model in addition to the diffusion full and steady dynamic and gravity wave models is a distinctive approximation of the saint venant equation ponce and simons 1977 according to table 1 the k w model is based on the continuity equation and only approximates the dynamic equation so that the friction slope is parallel to the bed slope miller 1983 the k w gives a valid approximation for hydraulics of one dimensional shallow unsteady and uniform flow travelling down across planar or wide surfaces in the absence of backwater effects and incompressibility of flow as shown in fig 2 lighthill and whitham 1955 wooding 1965 singh 1996 1 y t q x i i where y is depth of flow perpendicular to plane surface l q is unit discharge l 2 t 1 i

continuity and simplified form of the motion equation such that the friction slope is equal to the bed slope and therefore does not change with flow conditions the k w approximation which also denotes

uniform flow depth over the surface reduces the conversion factor γ to v 6 988 and 1 40 for si and bg units respectively however employing a zero upstream boundary condition to obtain the eq 7 gives a greater travelling time by a factor of 1 4 but it is more realistic and coincides with real cases as flow depth or flow velocity v lt 1 increases as flow travels to the downstream of the surface such that the maximum depth or occur at downstream edge of surface y x l y max v x l v max applying uniform flow depth over the surface assumed identical flow velocity over the planar surface which is equal to v max it should be noted that eqs 6 and 7 are valid if the parameters of s n ie i e infiltration and flow regime i e turbulent are constants over the plane surface wong 1996 considering the zero upstream flow condition and therefore flow depth growth implies a changing flow regime from laminar at the upstream edge through transitional at the middle distance to turbulent flow at the

considering these boundary conditions and also the length of flow with different regimes eq 8 the final form of t shf based on the kinematic wave solution for single planar surface in conditions of

estimate t shf despite numerous studies successfully applying the k w theory for modelling overland flow woolhiser and liggett 1967 derived a criterion referred to as the kinematic wave number η for judging the goodness of the k w approximation in modelling of sheet flow over a sloping plane 13 η sl yfr 2 all variables in eq 13 are defined previously substituting fr v gy eq 13 reduces to 14 η sgl v 2 woolhiser and liggett 1967 indicated that for η 50 the k w approximation would be very good replacing g 9 81 ms 2 in eq 14 sl v 2 should be 2 04 to have good approximation with k w theory units of v and l are ms 1 and m respectively which is valid for sheet flow over numerous natural surfaces therefore the criterion of η needs to check only for smooth surfaces in which applying the k w theory may produce a crude approximation for example in urban surfaces η may be below 20 another goodness of fit criteria was suggested by mccuen and spiess 1995 which implies that the k w assumption should be limited to the kinematic wave number n k w nl s 100 2 2 estimation of excess rainfall intensity in eqs 9 to 12 ie is the average excess rainfall intensity for the storm with duration equal to tt d t t therefore repeated solution of these equations are required to find an appropriate value of d that is equal to tt to eliminate this repetition problem chen and evan 1977 proposed the use of an intensity duration relation i d in the form of i a d b where a and b are regional constants in the manning formula eq 12 average rainfall intensity i is related to i e by a runoff coefficient c through the rational formula of ie c i asce 1992 welle and woodward 1986 used i d relations for two nrcs standard design storms type ii and iii in the form of i a p 24 d b where p 24 is 24 h rainfall depth in mm and constants a and b are 5 7 and 0 62 for storm type ii and 4 76 and 0 63 for storm type iii respectively the nrcs design storms i ia ii and iii are characterized by an intense rainfall period somewhere near the middle and lesser rainfall intensities at the beginning and end of the storm and have been applied to very large geographic regions cronshey and woodward 1989 for instance the type ii distribution has been applied to a large part of the central continental united states and type ia has been used in the pacific northwest scs 1973 tr 55 model uses a modified form of the manning formula eq 12 in which ie is replaced by 2 years p 24 15 t shf 5 5 p 24 nl s 4 5 however using i d relations in the estimation oftshf solves the repetition problem but leads to different results as reported by mccuen and spiess 1995 froehlich 2009 showed that estimation of tshf with the manning formula and i d relations proposed by welle and woodward 1986 produces significant error especially for a small duration i e d 15 min precise estimation of i for four types of rainfall distributions of nrcs and wide range of d were proposed by froehlich 2009 as 16 i e c 16 138 p 24 d 1 e

average excess rainfall intensity ie for different temporal rainfall distributions of nrcs 2 3 multiple planar surfaces in the previous section the approaches for estimation of t shf over a plane surface are presented in which the input parameters e g slope and roughness are homogeneous over the surface this condition is more consistent with sheet flow that occurs in the furthest upstream segment of the drainage path or across the street in an urban area commonly sheet flow from a wooded area may flow onto a dense grass covered surface which may then discharge onto a paved surface such as a driveway and continue over the rangeland or turf as shown in fig 3 each of these surfaces has a different resistance to flow or roughness and hydraulic radius and may differ in slope and infiltration thus equations that assume a single section that is homogeneous in land cover hydraulic radius and roughness i e one used in tr 55 cannot be applied mccuen and okunola 2002 the assumptions of zero upstream boundary conditions qu 0 and uniform flow distribution q u q d behind eq 12 that lead to these formulae cannot be applied precisely for the cascade of surface planes for a multi planar flow path with n planes in which flow from an upgradient plane discharges onto the next down gradient plane eqs 912 and 1517 should be extended wong 1996 derived the kinematic wave and manning formula for estimation of tshf for a series of planes the general form of tshf formulation for cascade of n planes is as follows 18 t shf j 1 n l j α j 1 β j m 1 j i e m l m 1 β j m 1 j 1 i e m l m 1 β j m 1 j i e m l m m 1 j 1 i e m l m where j is index for planes in direction of sheet flow eq 18 is based on the assumption that downstream outflow of one plane becomes the inflow to the adjacent plane downstream without backwater condition and all surfaces contribute in runoff generation replacing the values of α and β from eqs 3 a c corresponding to the flow regime in each section reduces eq 18 to a kinematic wave approximation the manning expression for estimation of the tshf over continuous multi planar surface for turbulent or near turbulent flow regimes so called k m3 can be obtained with parameters α and β from eq 4 employed in eq 18 as follows 19 t shf j 1 n 6 988 l j n j s j 0 6 m 1 j i e m l m 0 6 m 1 j 1 i e m l m 0 6 m 1 j i e m l m m 1 j 1 i e m l m 3 global

pawn derived from the authors names the model output distribution for t shf is characterized by a data sample cumulative density function cdf rather than its probability density function pdf practically in the pawn indices the sensitivity to input xi is measured by the distance between the empirical unconditional cdf of output t shf f t shf t shf that is obtained when all inputs vary simultaneously and the empirical conditional cdf f t shf x i t shf that are obtained when varying all inputs but x i is fixed at a nominal value through the kolmogorov smirnov statistic ks kolmogorov

p rainfall duration d average rainfall depth p 24 runoff coefficient c and length of plane surface l are calculated using eq 8 whereas the input parameters related to nrcs storm characteristics are considered according to froehlich 2009 the index t i is a helpful tool to investigate the relative influence of model parameters on predictive accuracy as well as to understand the dominant factors which control the precision of t shf 4 results and discussion the cumulative density function cdf of f t shf t shf and f t shf x i t shf for the model output t shf for the wide range of eight influenced parameters of k m formulation with zero upstream boundary condition n s d p λ cn p 24 l and also for nine effective parameters of k d formulation t f s d p λ cn p 24 l are computed the results are not shown the cdfs of all parameters grow significantly away from their initial uniform distributions but in different ways which lead to different sensitivity to these parameters the sensitivity index of ks x i for the influential parameters in the estimation of t shf by k d and k m formulations are shown in fig 5 where α 0 05 n 10 n u 100 and n c 50 in both formulations the effect of the temporal distribution of storm intensity is investigated by incorporating four temporal rainfall distributions of nrcs the values of ks x i indicate that the storm occurrence time e g winter or spring are not affected by the t shf estimated by k d formula since all values of this index rely on below critical values for a wide range of the flow temperature between 2 and 45 c as shown in fig 5 a in addition the t shf estimated by both formulations of k d and k m are not significantly sensitive to the wide range of rainfall depth p ranging from 0 to 1000 mm initial abstraction ratio λ ranged 0 001 to 0 8 and also curve number cn ranging from 30 to 99 for all types of nrcs storms except to p 100 mm of nrcs type ii in k m formula fig 5 e g and m o according to eq 17 the parameters p λ and cn contribute to the calculation of runoff coefficient c which is apparently not a significantly influential parameter on t shf it should be noted that the values of ks indicate the relative influence of the corresponding parameter in comparison with other influential parameters further investigations indicate that computing the ks for the input parameters of k d and k m formulae by directly entering the parameter c into eq 16 in the range of 0 05 to 0 95 show that t shf is significantly sensitive to lower and upper values of c 0 15 or 0 80 for all nrcs storms as shown in fig 6 however the sensitivity of t shf to the lower and upper ranges of parameter c through k m formula is greater than k m according to fwha 1996 the lower values of c correspond to lawns with sandy soil and un improved natural area e g forest whereas the upper values correspondent to asphaltic and concrete area in developed urban watersheds e g rooftops parking lots and paved surfaces results of the ks corresponding to both k m and k d formulations indicate that t shf is not influenced by c over the areas with intermediate values of runoff coefficient 0 2 c 0 8 for the upper values of c the effect of temporal rainfall distribution i e nrcs storms is more dominant than for lower values the t shf is influenced by flow resistance parameter f in k d and parameter n in k m formulae for lower f 10 and n 0 22 and upper f 50 and n 0 6 values of surface roughness as shown in fig 5 b and j according to engman 1986 the lower values of n correspond to asphalt and concrete bare soil and natural rangeland areas whereas the upper values link to the surfaces covered with dense grass interestingly the sensitivity of the t shf estimated by k d and k m formulae to lower values of flow resistance is similar for four types of nrcs storms however the effect of temporal rainfall distribution is dominant for very rough surfaces the intermediate rough surfaces i e 0 2 n 0 6 do not have a significant influence on the t shf despite the dominance of temporal rainfall distribution for these surfaces surface plane slope s 10 or 6 has a significant influence on the estimation of t shf by two formulations of k m and k d fig 5 c and k this surface slope is frequently observed in natural watersheds except to steep hill slopes which may be unstable and also for the design of transverse slopes of roads fhwa 1984 5 the meaningfulness of the rainfall duration d on the t shf estimated by k m and k d formulae is limited to d 180 min or 6 hr for all types of nrcs storms storms with a duration 6 hr do not have a significant impact on the t shf due to the decreasing storm intensity according to i d relations the t shf is influenced significantly by 2 years 24 h rainfall depth for p 24 200 mm or p 24 800 mm for both formulations of k m and k d and different types of nrcs storms fig 5 h and p the range of p 24 200 mm covers the 2 years daily rainfall depth for all types of nrcs design storms in usa scs 1986 the significant effect of surface plane length l on the estimation of t shf by the k d and k m formulations is limited to about l 3500 m fig 5 i and q noting the constraint of 100 m or 300 ft for sheet flow length by tr 55 this parameter plays an important role in the t shf over a wide range of surfaces in natural and urban watersheds according to eq 18 the sensitivity index ks is calculated as the maximum value of ks over all possible values of input parameters in the k m and k d formulations see fig 7 this index can be beneficial for ranking the sensitivity of the parameters that influence t shf for different storm types results of fig 7 reveal the dominant influence of parameter l in the estimation of tshf by k m and k d formulae and also for all types of nrcs storms except in the case of nrcs type ii and k m formula where the parameter n has the greatest influence after the parameter l the order of index t i changes for k m and k d formulations and also for nrcs design storms for all types of nrcs storms the t shf estimated by k m has the minimum sensitivity to the flow temperature however the t shf estimated by both formulations indicate lower sensitivity to the parameters of the scs cn model i e λ cn and p according to eq 17 but incorporating the runoff coefficient c directly in the models results in a significant increase of t i related to this parameter 0 35 for k d and 0 4 to 0 5 for k m on average the two formulations of k d and k m consistently indicate that the plane surface characteristics i e n or f cn l and s have the greater impacts on the t shf t i 0 43 and 0 41 respectively in comparison to storm and climate characteristics i e t d λ p and p 24 t i 0 20 and 0 27 respectively for all nrcs storms the surface related parameters have a near equal influence on t shf whereas in the k m formula there is higher sensitivity to the parameters related to storm and climate in addition the order of average sensitivity of the t shf on the input parameters of k d and k m formulae are associated with the nrcs type ii t i 0 33 and 0 40 i iii and then type ia respectively table 2 summarizes the values of flow resistance coefficients τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 and n for three surfaces of grass concrete and turf used for estimation of the t shf by the four formulae which were obtained from previous experiments it should be mentioned that the values of τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 and n in table 2 are based on selected parameters e g surface slope rainfall intensity surface roughness that were adopted in the application examples the flow resistance coefficients need revision due to complicated dynamics of flow resistance caused by the influential factors saghafian and julien 1989 6 application of formulae twenty sets of experimental data covering a wide range of the influential factors i e l s i e and n on the measured t shf over a single plane surface are collected from previous studies and used to illustrate the performance of the developed formulations table 2 indicates the source experimental data observed values of t shf and also t shf values estimated using the k m formula in two conditions q u q d so called k m1 and qu 0 so called k m2 and k d formula for these experimental data the tr 55 formula cannot be used due to lack of available information of p 24 values results of table 2 indicate that the calculated goodness of fit criteria η obtained by using eq 13 or 14 and n k w indicates that all values of η and n k w are significantly greater and smaller than threshold value of 50 and 100 respectively this guarantees that the k w theory provides a very good approximation for all cases shown in table 2 considering zero upstream boundary condition assumed by k m1 formula are more realistic as flow runs over the single plane rather than the assumption of uniform flow depth all over the surface plane for this purpose the average percentage of error ape for three formulae of k m1 k m2 and k d and for different flow regimes downgradient of the surface plane are computed and shown in fig 8 this assumption resulted in a reduction of ape in the estimation of t shf as 22 17 26 27 and 18 90 for laminar transitional and turbulent flow regime respectively it is noteworthy that incorporating the darcy weisbach friction in k w theory i e k d formula outperforms k m1 and k m2 especially for laminar and turbulent sheet flow regimes however in transitional flow regime the ape values for k d and k m2 are close together 6 03 and 6 39 respectively but the k d indicates significant improvement for laminar and turbulent flow regime 6 4 and 5 67 respectively it is noteworthy that among the used experimental data the minimum ape value in the estimation of the t shf by three formulae is obtained in the cases of having the transitional and laminar flow regimes downgradient in the surface plane fig 8 three formulae have the maximum error in estimation of t shf for turbulent flow regime downgradient in the plane despite the fact that the manning based formulae i e k m1 and k m2 is based on the assumption of occurring turbulent flow regime over the whole surface plane the k d formula is also proficient i e less ape value in this flow regime condition underestimation of t shf by three formulae especially when the sheet flow regime is turbulent see the calculated values of t shf in table 2 may lead to the overestimation of peak discharge in the hydrological design these findings imply that considering one type of flow regime i e turbulent throughout the surface plane as is the case with the manning based formulae could not be relied on to coincide with the realistic hydraulic condition of sheet flow previous research works i e bulter 1977 singh 1988 chen and wong 1993 reported the inevitability of laminar or transitional flow regimes occurring before turbulent flow regime as sheet flow moves downgradient of the surface plane which leads to increasing the t shf moreover uncertainties and data scarcity of friction factor f for different flow regimes and surface types are likely reasons why t shf is underestimated by k d formula the performance of the k m and k d formulae in the estimation of t shf are also compared over hillslope riparian stream hydrologic connectivity system as multiple continuous planes mcps unfortunately no previous experimental data is available to assess the t shf over mcps for the purpose of intercomparison of two k m and k d formulae a continuous cascade of three surfaces are assumed as a grassy surface at up gradient plane covered by kentucky blue grass a smooth surface at middle plane e g rooftops parking lot and paved surfaces such as streets and a slightly rough surface i e turf at down gradient plane for the real world application of the results the surface planes and storm and climate characteristics in these examples were collected from the previous studies the effect of temporal distributions of rainfall is also investigated by considering four nrcs type i ia ii and iii the flow resistance parameters τ 1 τ 2 and τ 3 manning s roughness coefficient n and runoff coefficient c of three considered surfaces are given in table 2 these parameters are kept constant for the corresponding surfaces in all analysis the values of t shf by two formulae k m and k d are calculated by considering numerous sets of input parameters some of the results are shown in table 4 for each case the percentage of turbulent flow portion on the three surfaces and the absolute difference of two formulations in the estimation of t shf are also calculated and given in table 4 results shown in table 4 can be summarized as follows 1 in all cases the estimated values of t shf by the k d formula are greater than those obtained by the k m3 approach due to incorporating the effects of three flow regimes laminar transitional and turbulent in k d formula instead of turbulent flow only longer t shf leads to delaying the time of peak flow and thus changes the shape of the unit hydrograph obtained by two formulae 2 a significant inverse correlation between the difference of k m3 and k d results and the portion of turbulent flow regime over the surfaces of planes is observed when the nrcs storm type i ii and iii is considered a weak correlation between two formulations of k d and k m3 is observed when the nrcs storm type ia is applied 3 changing the sheet flow temperature due to weather conditions and rainy season affects the t shf estimated by k d formula whereas the k m3 formula cannot incorporate the changes in flow temperature this is one of the disadvantages of manning based formulations 4 the estimated values of t shf over multi planar surfaces by k d and k m3 formulae are also affected by the sequence of the planes if the sequence of planes in the sheet flow direction is grassy area concrete turf g c t the t shf obtained by the k d and also k m3 formulae are different from other surface arrangement e g g t c or c t g the gradual increase of flow resistance or decrease of runoff coefficient in direction of sheet flow over the cascade of surface planes leads to the two formulations giving close results and less travel time than other sequences of surfaces see rows 1 8 and 9 in table 3 5 the calculated values of the t shf through nrcs storm type ia and type ii produces the maximum and minimum values of t shf respectively 6 since the tr 55 formula uses 2 years p 24 for the excess rainfall intensity i e the same results are estimated using this formula when p 24 is constant even if rainfall intensities change significantly i e different nrcs storms 7 conclusion for small watersheds in which sheet flow is the major contributor or possibly the only contributor to the time of concentration of watershed the difference in estimation of t shf made when using various k w based formulations likely have a considerable influence on peak flow estimation and hence the appropriate design of drainage structures the results obtained from gsa demonstrated that the main controlling parameters of t shf over the single plane and cascade of multiple planes estimated by k m and k d formulae are flow resistance length of the surface plane surface slope and excess rainfall intensity conversely the lowest sensitivity of t shf in k d formula is to flow viscosity this implies t shf is not affected by the weather temperature if the other influential parameters are kept constant results of this study indicate that the kinematic darcy weisbach formulation k d outperforms the kinematic manning k m formula in the estimation of t shf due to the fact that it considers the variations of flow regime on the surface plane the developed formulae in this study maybe serve in the structure of stormwater hydrological models e g tr 55 and hydrocad to have appropriate estimation of t shf in urban and small watersheds and therefore increase confidence in design peak discharge and drainage structure sizes for the required level of risk despite the fact that a more precise estimation of t shf would be obtained using the k d formula over the single plane surface of the lack of available data and also uncertainties associated with the friction factor f for different flow regimes and surface roughness is a significant challenge with the application of this formula overestimation of peak discharge may occur in hydrological forecasting and design due to use of shorter estimates of t shf estimated by both manning and darcy weisbach based formulae the estimated t shf by two formulations of kinematic manning k m3 and k d over the cascade of continuous planes is also affected by the sequence of the planes due to change in upstream flow boundary condition the kinematic wave approximation of saint venant equations obtained by the method of characteristics is analytic computationally efficient considers the effects of flow regime over multiple planes and accurate rainfall intensity in estimation of travel time of sheet flow in one dimension more accurate results can be obtained with employing a physically based fully distributed numerical model that are more realistic avoiding the simplifications considering the spatial heterogeneity of data and also the effect of more flow components i e
