25225,to increase the efficiency of computing phytoplankton growth rate μ chlorophyll to carbon θ and nitrogen to carbon ratios q n in three dimensional ocean circulation models it is preferable to directly calculate θ and q n from ambient environmental factors instead of treating them as independent tracers optimality based modeling has emerged as a novel and efficient approach to fulfill this task however it is still unclear precisely how the response of optimality based models differs from conventional models we compare a recent optimality based phytoplankton model pahlow model based on which the familiar droop function can be derived to a commonly used monod type monod model the two models generate similar patterns of μ with some important differences compared to the monod model the pahlow model predicts higher μ under light limitation the pahlow model also predicts that θ decreases with decreasing light under dim light and predicts decreasing q n with increasing light even at constant nutrient levels compared to the monod model these features of the pahlow model qualitatively agree better with laboratory data the pahlow model also suffers from a few shortcomings including the underestimation of θ under very low light and two times of computation time compared to the monod model the two models generate striking differences of q n and θ in a one dimensional implementation validation of such patterns will require more direct in situ measurements of μ θ and q n keywords ocean model north pacific light nutrient metraopolis hastings monte carlo 1 introduction functional relationships for phytoplankton properties such as the growth rate μ chlorophyll to carbon θ and nitrogen to carbon ratios q n in terms of abiotic environmental factors such as nutrient and light are essential to any plankton model and have been studied extensively droop 1974 jassby and platt 1976 cloern et al 1995 litchman et al 2007 edwards et al 2012 2015 2016 a widely adopted approach is to treat phytoplankton carbon nitrogen and chlorophyll as independent tracers and make μ dependent on q n such as the droop function droop 1974 and also dependent on θ and light as in geider et al 1997 1998 this approach has been implemented in some three dimensional ocean general circulation models gcms such as ersem butenschön et al 2016 and a global size structured plankton model ward et al 2012 although sound this approach requires a great many calculations particularly when a large number of phytoplankton species are included in a 3d gcm follows et al 2007 barton et al 2010 ward et al 2012 another drawback is that for tracers having spatial gradients of opposite sign e g phytoplankton carbon concentrations are typically higher near the sea surface while chlorophyll concentrations are higher at depth due to photo acclimation their corresponding diffusive fluxes will be in opposite directions which is unrealistic it is therefore preferable not to have multiple tracers for components of the same phytoplankton biomass on the other hand fixed θ or q n based on the redfield ratio are unrealistic and should be avoided to the extent possible geider and la roche 2002 flynn 2003 christian 2005 one approach to this dilemma is provided by optimality based models which can be viewed as intermediate between the two extremes considered above flynn 2003 the principle of the optimality concept is that all organisms that face physiological tradeoffs can be assumed to attain maximal fitness by adjusting trait values sutherland 2005 armstrong 2006 smith et al 2011 mathematically the optimal trait value can be computed by solving the fitness gradient function by assuming instantaneous acclimation smith et al 2011 and μ θ and q n can be directly calculated based on external environmental conditions such as temperature light and nutrient concentrations this speeds up computation because otherwise two or more independent tracers phytoplankton chlorophyll and carbon must be added to the model geider et al 1998 ward et al 2012 encouragingly ward 2017 recently showed that the instantaneous acclimation of cellular nutrient quota can accurately approximate the simulation outputs of a dynamic quota model which requires an additional tracer for each nutrient considered even under dynamic environmental conditions in this study we focus on an optimality based phytoplankton model developed by pahlow and coworkers hereafter pahlow model fig 1 pahlow and oschlies 2013 pahlow et al 2013 smith et al 2016 the success of the pahlow model is reflected in that it provided the first theoretical derivation of the well known droop quota model pahlow and oschlies 2013 and has been validated extensively against laboratory datasets pahlow et al 2013 and somewhat against oceanic observations arteaga et al 2014 fernández castro et al 2016 smith et al 2016 although elegant the basic mathematical properties of the pahlow model and its coupling to ocean circulation models have not been thoroughly investigated smith et al 2016 in particular given that the fundamental relationships of μ versus light and nutrient appear similar to the widely used monod type model it remains to be explored to what extent the simpler monod type model can with suitable tuning of parameter values reproduce the output of the pahlow model burmaster 1979 flynn 2003 another consideration is that although the optimality assumptions have simplified much of the computation the pahlow model still requires more calculations compared with the computationally simpler monod model if it can be shown that the two models are mathematically similar and generate similar patterns under realistic ocean conditions then the use of the monod model may be justified in many cases due to the mathematical complexity of the pahlow model its complete algebraic manipulation as begun by smith et al 2016 is beyond the scope of this study instead we tuned the monod type models to approximate the output of the mathematically more complex pahlow model and compared the resulting growth responses to light and nutrient we also embedded the two models of phytoplankton in a one dimensional model set up at two representative time series observation stations in the subtropical north pacific fig 2 and compared the performance of the two models against observations 2 methods 2 1 optimality based phytoplankton model pahlow model in the pahlow model phytoplankton cells are assumed to instantaneously optimize their cellular chl a and nitrogen contents to obtain maximal net growth which is the net outcome of co2 fixation minus the energetic costs of photosynthesis and nutrient uptake note that although pahlow et al 2013 also included phosphorus limitation and nitrogen fixation in their model for simplicity we here consider only nitrogen as the limiting nutrient there are three levels of optimization in the simplified pahlow model the first is the optimization of the chl c ratio within the chloroplast θ ˆ 0 to maximize net photosynthesis i e gross photosynthesis minus the cost of chlorophyll maintenance pahlow et al 2013 necessarily assumed that the net photosynthesis of a chloroplast is independent of nutrient levels but the number of chloroplasts within one cell is dependent on nitrogen availability by solving the gradient function of net photosynthesis of one chloroplast against θ ˆ 0 θ ˆ 0 can be solved as follows see pahlow et al 2013 for details 1 θ ˆ 0 1 ζ c h l μ 0 α c h l i 1 w 0 1 r m c h l μ 0 e 1 α c h l i ζ c h l μ 0 i f i i 0 θ ˆ 0 θ m i n i f i i 0 in which i is irradiance w m 2 αchl is the chlorophyll specific initial slope of photosynthesis irradiance p i curve ζchl is the cost of photosynthesis coefficient r m c h l is the cost of chl maintenance μ 0 is the phytoplankton potential carbon acquisition rate w 0 is the zero branch of the lambert w function i 0 ζ c h l r m c h l α c h l is the threshold light level for chlorophyll synthesis θmin is the minimal chlorophyll to carbon ratio equaling zero in pahlow et al 2013 both r m c h l and μ 0 are temperature dependent and are assumed to have the same temperature coefficient ep 2 μ 0 μ 0 e e p k 1 t 0 1 t where μ 0 is the phytoplankton potential carbon acquisition at the reference temperature t 0 288 k ep is the activation energy ev of phytoplankton growth k is the boltzmann constant 8 62 10 5 ev k 1 from eq 1 it is clear that light is the most important abiotic factor directly affecting θ ˆ 0 temperature also has some indirect less important effects as shown later θ ˆ 0 is a nonlinear function of light under high light it is beneficial for the phytoplankton cell to slow down chlorophyll synthesis to reduce the cost of photosynthesis because this reduces only slightly the rate of photosynthesis if light level is too low approaching or below i 0 however the phytoplankton cell has negligible photosynthesis and also needs to reduce θ ˆ 0 the second level of optimization is to balance the energy allocation between photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake pahlow and oschlies 2013 assumed that the total nitrogen of the phytoplankton cell is partitioned among three pools machineries of carbon acquisition and nitrogen uptake plus subsistence requirements the net relative growth of the cell equals to net photosynthesis of the whole cell minus the respiratory cost of nitrogen uptake by solving the gradient function of the net relative growth against the allocation factor fv for nitrogen uptake the optimal cellular nitrogen quota qn mol n mol c 1 can be calculated as pahlow and oschlies 2013 3 q n q s n 1 1 1 q s n μ ˆ i v ˆ n ζ n where q s n is the structural nitrogen quota and equals half of the minimal nitrogen quota q 0n as often reported in the literature v ˆ n is the potential nutrient uptake rate μ ˆ i is the light dependent growth rate after accounting for photosynthesis and chlorophyll maintenance ζ n represents the cost of nitrogen assimilation fv can be calculated from qn 4 f v q s n q n ζ n q n 2 q s n the chlorophyll to carbon ratio θ mol c gchl 1 of the whole cell can be calculated as 5 θ θ ˆ 0 1 q s n q n f v μ ˆ i is calculated following eq a2 in pahlow et al 2013 6 μ ˆ i μ 0 s i μ 0 s i r m c h l ζ c h l θ ˆ 0 where si is the degree of light saturation 7 s i 1 e α c h l θ ˆ 0 i μ 0 it can be seen from eq 3 that since μ ˆ i increases with light and v ˆ n increases with nitrogen qn should decrease with increasing light and increase with increasing nitrogen concentration the third level of optimization is with respect to the tradeoff between nutrient uptake on the cell surface and nutrient assimilation within the cell pahlow 2005 smith et al 2009 the potential nutrient uptake rate v ˆ n is calculated as 8 v ˆ n v 0 n n v 0 n a 0 n 2 v 0 n n a 0 n n in which v 0 n d 1 is the maximal potential nitrogen uptake rate a 0 n m3 mmol 1 d 1 is the maximal potential affinity n is ambient nitrogen concentration mmol m 3 both v 0 n and a 0 n share the same temperature dependence as r m c h l and μ 0 in eq 2 eq 8 differs from the michaelis menten equation in that the apparent half saturation constant increases with n smith et al 2009 finally phytoplankton net growth rate μ is calculated as 9 μ μ ˆ i 1 2 q s n q n note that although eq 9 is in the same form as the droop model droop 1974 as derived by pahlow and oschlies 2013 the nutrient term also depends on light level since qn depends on light 2 2 monod type model a traditional model that relates phytoplankton growth rate with external nutrient concentration light and temperature is the monod type model 10 μ μ m n n k n 1 e α c i μ m where kn is the half saturation constant of nitrogen for phytoplankton growth αc is the carbon specific slope of the growth irradiance curve μm differs from the μ0 in that it already takes into account algal respiration μm is also temperature dependent 11 μ m μ m e e p k 1 t 0 1 t note that because our intent was to directly calculate μ from abiotic environmental factors without introducing extra tracers such as chl a concentration there is no θ in eq 10 flynn 2003 noted that although eq 10 may less faithfully describe the light dependence of growth compared to other models such as in geider et al 1997 its predictions differ only slightly from other models at least when the temporal dynamics of photo acclimation are not the central focus following flynn 2003 θ can be calculated as 12 θ θ m i n μ i α c h l in which θ min represents the minimal chlorophyll to carbon ratio at very high light the maximal θ θ max can be achieved at minimal light and saturating nutrient conditions and can be derived following the l hôpital s rule 13 θ m a x θ m i n lim i 0 μ i α c h l θ m i n 1 α c h l lim i 0 μ m 1 e α c i μ m i θ m i n α c α c h l by substituting αchl in eq 13 into eq 12 we obtain 14 θ θ m i n μ i α c θ m a x θ m i n in which θ max can be imported from the pahlow model eq 5 note that eq 12 always holds if phytoplankton growth is limited by light acquisition instead of calvin cycle processes flynn 2003 the nutrient effect on θ is embedded within the nutrient dependence of μ the derived patterns of θ to light and nutrients are also consistent with other models cloern et al 1995 geider et al 1997 further by equating ambient nutrient dependent and internal quota dependent growth rates morel 1987 15 μ μ m n n k n μ m 1 q m i n q n 1 q m i n q m a x where q min is the minimal nitrogen quota 2qs n and q max is the maximal nitrogen quota and is assumed 3 times of q min litchman et al 2007 marañón et al 2013 qn can be calculated from eq 15 16 q n q m i n 1 1 q m i n q m a x n n k n as such our formulation of the monod model also allows to directly calculate θ and qn from external environmental nitrogen light and temperature thus both the pahlow and monod models share similar inputs i e temperature light inorganic nitrogen and outputs μ θ qn being able to provide estimates of flexible θ and qn assuming instantaneous acclimation without the necessity of computing the dynamics of independent tracers of cellular carbon and chlorophyll contents within phytoplankton cells fig 1 to allow similar parameterizations between both models we used an adaptive nonlinear least square regression to estimate the parameters i e μ m kn and αc of the monod model by fitting the growth rates of the monod model against the outputs of pahlow model under various light and nutrient conditions after selecting the parameters of the pahlow model fig 3 a and d this was implemented with the function nls with the port algorithm in r 3 3 2 dennis et al 1981 r core team 2016 2 3 analysis of laboratory data for phytoplankton chlorophyll to carbon and nitrogen to carbon ratios from five published studies falkowski and owens 1980 laws and bannister 1980 terry et al 1983 falkowski et al 1985 strzepek and price 2000 we compiled a dataset of θ and qn of nine phytoplankton taxa under light limiting conditions to validate the outputs of the two models we focus on θ and qn because the predictions of θ and qn under light limitation are the most striking contrasts between the pahlow and monod models the data for two of the nine taxa were used in pahlow et al 2013 to be consistent with the 1d model we converted all the light units to w m 2 by calculating the total daily photon doses assuming 1 w m 2 2 5 mol photons m 2 d 1 the light levels i were log transformed logi to reach a quasi normal distribution to see the general trend of θ and qn with light we used a linear mixed effect model to allow random deviations of both the slope and the intercept of qn logi because the relationship of θ with light could be nonlinear due to the trend of decreasing θ with decreasing light under dim light pahlow et al 2013 westberry et al 2016 we included a second order term of logi in the general linear mixed effect model of θ logi the linear mixed effect model was implemented using the package lme4 in r bates et al 2014 the parameters of the pahlow model shown in table 1 mostly followed pahlow et al 2013 some parameters particularly αchl and a 0n that are the most important traits determining the light and nutrient affinity can be species specific we used the parameters optimized from the one dimensional model to calculate θ and qn which were then contrasted with the laboratory data fig 4 2 4 one dimensional model to examine the performances of the two models under more realistic conditions we embedded the two phytoplankton models within a simple one dimensional 1d numerical model surface to 250 m depth implemented for two stations s1 145 e 30 n aloha 158 e 22 75 n in the north pacific fig 2a this 1d model contained four biological tracers dissolved inorganic nitrogen phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus for simplicity the physical variables relevant to biological processes i e temperature surface photosynthetically available radiance par 0 and vertical eddy diffusivity k v were imported from external data products and linearly interpolated for each time step and depth level chen and smith 2018 par 0 data were imported from seawifs satellite monthly climatology products seasonal temperature vertical profiles were imported from world ocean atlas 2013 monthly climatology the profiles of kv were imported from the output of an eddy permitting model for north pacific hashioka et al 2009 light levels iz at depth z were calculated based on par 0 and chl a concentrations following the beer lambert law 17 i z p a r 0 e z k w k c h l 0 z c h l x d x in which kw and kchl are the attenuation coefficients for seawater and chl a respectively however one problem with the eulerian framework is that the time for a phytoplankton cell to mix throughout the surface mixed layer ml is much less than its doubling time franks 2015 we therefore calculated the ambient light level for phytoplankton within the ml as the average light i throughout the ml the mixed layer depth mld is defined as the deepest depth with k v 10 3 m2 s 1 based on the equation τ l l 2 k z eq 1 in franks 2015 the average time τl for a phytoplankton cell to move at a distance l of 100 m at the local diffusivity k z of 10 3 m2 s 1 is roughly half a day as such we assumed that the phytoplankton cells within the ml should receive the average light throughout the ml i was used to calculate phytoplankton μ θ and qn for temporal evolution of phytoplankton biomass and also standing stocks of chl a this might cause a sharp transition of phytoplankton properties across the bottom of the ml however to compare with in situ net primary production npp estimates derived from incubation bottles that were not mixed during incubation phytoplankton μ θ and qn were recalculated from iz based on the beer lambert law thus npp depends directly on iz instead of i due to the inevitable incubation problem 18 n p p p μ n i z t q n n i z t phytoplankton sinking was assumed negligible due to the dominance of small phytoplankton at the two oligotrophic stations campbell et al 1997 fujiki et al 2016 only detritus was assumed to sink at a constant rate wd m d 1 zooplankton specific ingestion rate g d 1 of phytoplankton was described as a holling iii function 19a g g m e e z k 1 t 0 1 t p 2 p 2 k p 2 in which gm is the maximal ingestion rate d 1 e z is the activation energy ev of zooplankton grazing kp is the grazing half saturation constant μmol n m 3 of zooplankton we also tested holling i and ii

nitrogen at a rate with the same activation energy with zooplankton ez the zooplankton mortality term is assumed proportional to the square of zooplankton biomass steele and henderson 1992 ohman and

inorganic nitrogen din chl a concentrations and npp were collected in the k2s1 project https ebcrpa jamstec go jp k2s1 en index html fujiki et al 2016 honda 2016 matsumoto et al 2016 wakita et al 2016 for station aloha the observational data were downloaded from the hawaii ocean time series website http hahana soest hawaii edu hot we pooled all the observational data into one climatological year assuming that seasonal changes of environmental conditions are the major factors determining changes in biological variables and inter annual variations are relatively less important in addition we estimated surface θ 9 km resolution from a seawifs monthly climatology http gdata1 sci gsfc nasa gov daac bin g3 gui cgi instance id ocean month by dividing phytoplankton carbon with chl a following behrenfeld et al 2005 we assumed a constant ratio of 0 3 for phytoplankton carbon to total particulate organic carbon poc poc was provided as a product on the seawifs website calculated based on an empirical relationship between poc and blue to green band reflectance ratio stramski et al 2008 for quantitative evaluations of model performances we calculated the sum of squared errors ssqe between the observational data and corresponding model predictions because the model started to converge to regular seasonal patterns from the second year we ran the model for three years and used the output of the final year to compare with observational data the model outputs were linearly interpolated to the observed depths and dates to allow comparisons among different data types and downplay the effects of extreme values both the model outputs and observational data were transformed to their 1 4 power and normalized between 0 and 1 to achieve a quasi normal distribution 21 s s q e k i j 1 n k

k nk i is the number of observations for data type i at station k ok i j and mk i j are the observed and modeled j th values respectively for data type i at station k ok i min and ok i max are minimal and maximal observed values for data type i at station k respectively note that we also first optimized parameters of the pahlow model against observational data at both stations using the algorithm of delayed rejection adaptive metraopolis hastings monte carlo haario et al 2016 laine 2008 chen and smith 2018 then we obtained the parameters of the monod model by fitting the growth rate outputs of pahlow model to achieve similar parameterizations for the two models with this approach we expected that the pahlow model should perform better than the monod model albeit the difference should not be substantial we then conducted a sensitive analysis to investigate whether the choice of certain parameter values would alter the relative performances between the two models in particular we tested how the type of grazing functions and the values of αchl and a 0n affect the model results table 2 we varied the model parameters one by one holding other parameters the same as in the default run in table 1 we also limited the parameter values within realistic ranges noted in previous modeling studies fennel et al 2006 franks 2009 the notation and values of model parameters are shown in table 1 note that in preparation for future development of three dimensional ocean models we have intentionally applied the same set of parameters for the two stations the model fortran codes r scripts and results are available on https github com bingzhangchen citrate 3 results 3 1 comparisons of μ θ and qn between the pahlow and monod models both phytoplankton models estimate phytoplankton μ θ and qn based on ambient environmental temperature din concentrations and light the relationships between the growth rate and nitrogen light and temperature of the pahlow model when other resources are replete can be approximated by the monod model with slight departures fig 3a d g although the differences are small the pahlow model predicts a somewhat flatter transition of growth rate than the monod model as resource levels increase because θ declines with increasing light and the half saturation concentration for nitrogen uptake increases with increasing nutrient concentration smith et al 2009 for this reason the fitted value of kn for the monod model also depends on the nutrient range considered with the pahlow model considering a larger range of nutrient concentrations will yield a higher fitted value of kn the growth rates differ most between the two models when both nutrients and light levels are limiting fig 3 the pahlow model predicts higher growth rates at the same nutrient concentration than the monod model when light is limiting and also predicts higher growth rates under the same light level when nutrient is limiting when nutrient or light is limiting the pahlow model also predicts that the growth rate increases faster with temperature than the monod model the two models also predict different values of θ under low light fig 3b e h when the light deceases from high values the pahlow model predicts an increasing θ with decreasing light and then a decreasing trend of θ when the light approaches the threshold value fig 3e this is particularly evident when light is plotted on a log scale fig 4 by contrast the monod model predicts that θ decreases strictly monotonically with decreasing light the pahlow model also predicts that θ increases with temperature faster than the monod model when light is limiting for qn although both models predict that qn values increase with ambient n the pahlow model predicts that qn values should increase with decreasing light levels while qn values do not vary with light in the monod model fig 3c f as such under low light the pahlow model predicts higher qn values than the monod model the pahlow model also predicts that qn values increase with temperature when light is limiting while the monod model predicts that qn is independent of temperature 3 2 comparisons with laboratory data analysis of laboratory data for phytoplankton qn reveals a significant decreasing trend of qn with increasing light when nutrients are replete fixed effect t 3 69 p 0 001 although this trend varies among taxa fig 4a for θ the second order term of the linear mixed effect model is significantly negative t 4 26 p 0 001 suggesting that the decreasing trend of θ with decreasing light under dim light is real fig 4b thus in general the pahlow model shows better qualitative fits to the patterns of qn and θ in laboratory experiments although the pahlow model underestimates θ under dim light 3 3 1d model before comparing the modeled biological variables with in situ observations we ensured the validity of the external physical forcing the mlds estimated from modeled profiles of k v fit well with observations at the two stations fig 2 station s1 shows the typical vertical mixing pattern in the subtropics with more vigorous mixing in the winter and stratification in the summer fig 2b the mixed layer depth reaches nearly 200 m in february and march after april the mixed layer rapidly shoals to around 15 m until august and then deepens again temperatures in the surface mixed layer vary from 18 c in february and march to 27 c in august and september fig 2d the surface par ranges from 19 to 54 mol photons d 1 m 2 equivalent to 47 5 to 135 w m 2 fig 2f compared to station s1 the seasonal variation of mixing at station aloha is less drastic although the winter mixing is still stronger than during summer fig 2c the surface mixed layer exhibits weak mixing throughout the whole year the mixing difference between s1 and aloha is also reflected in the vertical profiles of temperature in which the seasonal variations of surface temperature are less pronounced at aloha than at s1 fig 2e the surface par in general is slightly stronger at aloha than at s1 fig 2g both models are able to simulate the general pattern of high din in the winter and the subsequent drawdown of nutrients in the surface mixed layer from winter to summer at s1 fig 5 a however the monod model overestimates the surface din at station aloha fig 5b the superiority of the pahlow model in modeling din is also indicated by its smaller ssqe table 2 both models are also able to reproduce the general seasonal patterns of chl a concentrations and npp in the surface mixed layer at s1 fig 5 at aloha however the pahlow model underestimates chl in surface waters while the monod model agrees better with chl a observations fig 5d table 2 both models underestimate surface npp at aloha fig 5f examination of the seasonal vertical profiles at station s1 suggests that the modeled nutriclines are shallower than observed during summer and fall for both models fig 6 c d the two models also well reproduce the subsurface chlorophyll maximum scm layer compared to the pahlow model the monod model predicts higher chl a concentrations below the scm because of its higher predicted θ value under low light fig 6f h the pattern of higher chl a below scm in the monod model than the pahlow model is also evident at station aloha fig 7 e h both models generate an unrealistic subsurface peak of npp during summer at s1 fig 6k while both models particularly the pahlow model underestimate npp in surface waters at aloha fig 7i l quantitative comparisons based on ssqe yield mixed results for different variables table 2 the pahlow model simulates din better than the monod model at both stations while the converse is true for chl and npp particularly at aloha where the problem is mainly due to the pahlow model s underestimation of chl near the surface sensitivity analysis suggests that changing the type of grazing functional response severely deteriorates the performance of the models with other parameters unchanged table 2 reducing αchl to half of its original value makes the model fits worse than the standard run for din and chl at both stations the only improvement is for npp at s1 conversely if αchl is increased to twice its original value i e making light limitation less likely the fits of both models to din improve at both stations due to the increased nutrient uptake while the fit to chl worsens at aloha because the low din cannot support sufficient phytoplankton biomass compared to station aloha this change of parameter value improves the fitting for both din and chl at station s1 and only the fits for npp worsen changing the nutrient affinity a 0n barely affects the results of the pahlow model because of its dynamic acclimation response but substantially affects the performance of the monod model which lacks this acclimation response it is informative to directly compare μ θ and qn from the 1d model outputs between the two models within the surface mixed layer of s1 the monod model gives slower growth rate during the winter when mixing is more intense and light is more limiting than other seasons fig 8 a at station aloha the pahlow model predicts lower growth rate due to the lower din concentration fig 8b the pahlow model predicts higher values of θ and qn than the monod model during winter fig 8c f compared to the satellite derived estimates of θ both models predict higher values in winter and lower values in summer at s1 but underestimate it at aloha both models give lower qn values compared to the observed particulate n c ratios particularly during summer we also show the comprehensive modeled patterns of μ θ and qn at both stations fig 9 one noticeable difference between the two models is that the pahlow model predicts higher growth rate than the monod model in deeper waters and also in winter at s1 which reduces the upward nutrient diffusive flux and leads to lower chl a and npp at the surface figs 5 7 a more prominent difference is that the pahlow model predicts low θ values fig 9 in deep layers when light is negligible pahlow et al 2013 which does not occur with the monod model the pahlow model also predicts significantly higher qn values than the monod model exceeding the canonic redfield n c ratio in deep waters fig 9 a comparison of computation efficiency suggests that the pahlow model can cost 2 times of computation time than the monod model when we used intel fortran compiler with the compiler option fast on a macos sierra 10 12 5 i386 processor a single run of the pahlow model at station aloha took 0 071 min around 2 times of the monod model 0 036 min 4 discussion optimality based models which account for organisms ability to acclimate to external environmental conditions have been deemed a novel approach to faithfully represent biological mechanisms without compromising computational efficiency with the potential to be widely applied in 3d gcms follows and dutkiewicz 2011 smith et al 2011 2014 ward 2017 here we have compared the optimality based pahlow model and a computationally more efficient and more widely used monod model by examining the functional relationships between three key phytoplankton quantities μ qn and θ and environmental factors and testing whether both of them can well simulate the observed patterns in two subtropical stations these comparisons not only provide deep understandings of the model performances but also suggest new directions for future ocean observations we find that the relationships between μ and nutrient and light with the optimality based pahlow model can be fairly well approximated by the widely used monod model by parameter fitting although the modeled growth rates differ noticeably under light limiting conditions fig 3 this concurs with previous arguments that simple models can well approximate the results of complicated photo acclimation models flynn 2003 however here we have assessed these two models only at two contrasting subtropical stations which provides a stringent but limited test of their performance which can be expected to differ even more in applications over a wider range of environmental conditions such as in 3d regional and global models compared to the monod model the faster growth rates of the pahlow model under low light allow phytoplankton to consume more nutrients at the scm yielding lower levels of surface nitrate and chl this effect may be overly strong contributing to the pahlow model s underestimates of surface din and chl at station aloha fig 5 it is noteworthy that the ubiquitous and ecologically important prochlorococcus might have lost the capacity of photo acclimation partensky et al 1999 and if so the pahlow model may be unsuitable for modeling prochlorococcus however the pahlow model predicts qualitatively different patterns of qn and θ compared to our modified monod model which also gives dynamic estimates of these quantities these differences cannot be eliminated simply by parameter tuning if it can be proven that the patterns generated by the pahlow model are in fact more realistic than those from the monod model this would favor use of the pahlow model in gcms rather than tinkering with existing monod type models based on compilations of laboratory data for phytoplankton qn and θ under light limiting conditions fig 4 the pahlow model does perform better in terms of the increasing trend of qn with light limitation and the unimodal relationship between θ and light these unique patterns may support the validity of its underlying biological assumption that phytoplankton cells optimize their internal resource allocation to achieve maximal fitness constrained by the assumed tradeoff between photosynthesis and nutrient uptake these assumptions were also similarly supported by armstrong 2006 interestingly goldman 1986 argued that light should not directly affect qn which justifies that the extent of nutrient limitation can be quantified based on qn alone without considering light our compiled data suggests that light can indeed affect qn contradicting goldman s argument and suggesting that in order to evaluate the status of phytoplankton nutrient limitation light should be taken into account in other words similar n c ratios observed in phytoplankton cells under different light environments do not suggest that these cells are experiencing similar extents of nutrient limitation at high latitudes where light may be more limiting than at low latitudes phytoplankton cells need more nitrogen to synthesize light harvesting proteins and pigments klausmeier et al 2004 armstrong 2006 pahlow et al 2013 this also implies that light should be considered when searching for patterns of nutrient related traits for phytoplankton litchman et al 2007 edwards et al 2012 however the pahlow model is not perfect either it strongly underestimates θ under very low light as is apparent from fig 4b although phytoplankton θ can have a decreasing trend with decreasing light for par less than around 1 w m 2 there are no observed θ values lower than 0 24 gchl mol c 1 50 gc gchl 1 as the pahlow model predicts the model estimates of θ and qn are not less important than growth rate μ because chl and npp involve combined calculations of all three outputs i e μ θ and qn from the phytoplankton models it is possible that some model might be better in fitting chl or npp with the wrong combination of phytoplankton biomass in terms of nitrogen p μ θ and qn eq 18 the variations of θ are also critical for assessing the response of ocean primary production to environmental change from satellite observations which offer us unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage behrenfeld et al 2015 westberry et al 2016 the ideal approach to evaluate the phytoplankton models is to directly measure p μ θ and qn in the field currently direct measurements of θ and qn in the field are emerging but remain insufficient in both quantity and quality to distinguish between even the substantially different predictions of the two models considered herein graff et al 2012 2015 we urge that more measurements should be made particularly in the lower euphotic layer because such observations would be very useful for testing model performance and advancing understanding of phytoplankton physiology it is intriguing that the observed ratios of particulate organic nitrogen pon to poc at stations aloha and s1 in deep waters are less than those predicted by the pahlow model and closer to the redfield ratio fig 10 if we trust the qn predicted by the pahlow model a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy between phytoplankton qn and pon poc ratios in surface waters might be that microzooplankton have higher n c ratios than phytoplankton talmy et al 2016 in deeper waters however the modeled phytoplankton n c ratios even exceed the measured pon poc ratios which can only be reconciled if the n c ratios of other pools such as bacteria zooplankton or detritus are much lower than the redfield ratio to offset the high phytoplankton n c ratio this hypothesis remains to be validated 5 conclusions the original intent of this study was to use the classic monod type model to approximate the optimality based model of pahlow et al 2013 to further simplify and speed up computation both models assume instantaneous acclimation and therefore allow direct calculations of phytoplankton growth rate chlorophyll to carbon and nitrogen to carbon ratios from ambient environmental nitrogen light and temperature which circumvents the need to assign multiple tracers for the same phytoplankton population while both models can reproduce the field observations to some extent we find that even though we tuned the parameters of the monod model to the outputs of the pahlow model three features remain unique to the pahlow model the first is that phytoplankton can achieve higher growth rates in the pahlow model than in the monod model when they are under light limitation the second is that phytoplankton n c ratios depend on light availability with the pahlow model via its assumed tradeoff between photosynthesis and nutrient uptake this dependence was stressed previously by armstrong 2006 based on a single study laws and bannister 1980 and we have found further evidence for it based on a larger dataset including data for nine taxa the third is that with the pahlow model phytoplankton chlorophyll to carbon ratios decrease with decreasing light under dim light this is also partially corroborated by laboratory data although uncertainties remain and field data are sparse the commonly used monod model cannot easily reproduce all three of these observed patterns we therefore conclude that some essential postulates of the optimality based pahlow model such as the tradeoff between photosynthesis and nutrient uptake may be useful and even indispensable features that need to be considered in ocean biogeochemical models however we also identified some weakness of the pahlow model such as the underestimation of θ under very low light conditions which may account for its inability to outperform the monod model in the 1d simulations table 2 finally we urge for more direct measurements of phytoplankton biomass in terms of carbon and nitrogen specific growth rates chlorophyll to carbon and nitrogen to carbon ratios

25225,to increase the efficiency of computing phytoplankton growth rate μ chlorophyll to carbon θ and nitrogen to carbon ratios q n in three dimensional ocean circulation models it is preferable to directly calculate θ and q n from ambient environmental factors instead of treating them as independent tracers optimality based modeling has emerged as a novel and efficient approach to fulfill this task however it is still unclear precisely how the response of optimality based models differs from conventional models we compare a recent optimality based phytoplankton model pahlow model based on which the familiar droop function can be derived to a commonly used monod type monod model the two models generate similar patterns of μ with some important differences compared to the monod model the pahlow model predicts higher μ under light limitation the pahlow model also predicts that θ decreases with decreasing light under dim light and predicts decreasing q n with increasing light even at constant nutrient levels compared to the monod model these features of the pahlow model qualitatively agree better with laboratory data the pahlow model also suffers from a few shortcomings including the underestimation of θ under very low light and two times of computation time compared to the monod model the two models generate striking differences of q n and θ in a one dimensional implementation validation of such patterns will require more direct in situ measurements of μ θ and q n keywords ocean model north pacific light nutrient metraopolis hastings monte carlo 1 introduction functional relationships for phytoplankton properties such as the growth rate μ chlorophyll to carbon θ and nitrogen to carbon ratios q n in terms of abiotic environmental factors such as nutrient and light are essential to any plankton model and have been studied extensively droop 1974 jassby and platt 1976 cloern et al 1995 litchman et al 2007 edwards et al 2012 2015 2016 a widely adopted approach is to treat phytoplankton carbon nitrogen and chlorophyll as independent tracers and make μ dependent on q n such as the droop function droop 1974 and also dependent on θ and light as in geider et al 1997 1998 this approach has been implemented in some three dimensional ocean general circulation models gcms such as ersem butenschön et al 2016 and a global size structured plankton model ward et al 2012 although sound this approach requires a great many calculations particularly when a large number of phytoplankton species are included in a 3d gcm follows et al 2007 barton et al 2010 ward et al 2012 another drawback is that for tracers having spatial gradients of opposite sign e g phytoplankton carbon concentrations are typically higher near the sea surface while chlorophyll concentrations are higher at depth due to photo acclimation their corresponding diffusive fluxes will be in opposite directions which is unrealistic it is therefore preferable not to have multiple tracers for components of the same phytoplankton biomass on the other hand fixed θ or q n based on the redfield ratio are unrealistic and should be avoided to the extent possible geider and la roche 2002 flynn 2003 christian 2005 one approach to this dilemma is provided by optimality based models which can be viewed as intermediate between the two extremes considered above flynn 2003 the principle of the optimality concept is that all organisms that face physiological tradeoffs can be assumed to attain maximal fitness by adjusting trait values sutherland 2005 armstrong 2006 smith et al 2011 mathematically the optimal trait value can be computed by solving the fitness gradient function by assuming instantaneous acclimation smith et al 2011 and μ θ and q n can be directly calculated based on external environmental conditions such as temperature light and nutrient concentrations this speeds up computation because otherwise two or more independent tracers phytoplankton chlorophyll and carbon must be added to the model geider et al 1998 ward et al 2012 encouragingly ward 2017 recently showed that the instantaneous acclimation of cellular nutrient quota can accurately approximate the simulation outputs of a dynamic quota model which requires an additional tracer for each nutrient considered even under dynamic environmental conditions in this study we focus on an optimality based phytoplankton model developed by pahlow and coworkers hereafter pahlow model fig 1 pahlow and oschlies 2013 pahlow et al 2013 smith et al 2016 the success of the pahlow model is reflected in that it provided the first theoretical derivation of the well known droop quota model pahlow and oschlies 2013 and has been validated extensively against laboratory datasets pahlow et al 2013 and somewhat against oceanic observations arteaga et al 2014 fernández castro et al 2016 smith et al 2016 although elegant the basic mathematical properties of the pahlow model and its coupling to ocean circulation models have not been thoroughly investigated smith et al 2016 in particular given that the fundamental relationships of μ versus light and nutrient appear similar to the widely used monod type model it remains to be explored to what extent the simpler monod type model can with suitable tuning of parameter values reproduce the output of the pahlow model burmaster 1979 flynn 2003 another consideration is that although the optimality assumptions have simplified much of the computation the pahlow model still requires more calculations compared with the computationally simpler monod model if it can be shown that the two models are mathematically similar and generate similar patterns under realistic ocean conditions then the use of the monod model may be justified in many cases due to the mathematical complexity of the pahlow model its complete algebraic manipulation as begun by smith et al 2016 is beyond the scope of this study instead we tuned the monod type models to approximate the output of the mathematically more complex pahlow model and compared the resulting growth responses to light and nutrient we also embedded the two models of phytoplankton in a one dimensional model set up at two representative time series observation stations in the subtropical north pacific fig 2 and compared the performance of the two models against observations 2 methods 2 1 optimality based phytoplankton model pahlow model in the pahlow model phytoplankton cells are assumed to instantaneously optimize their cellular chl a and nitrogen contents to obtain maximal net growth which is the net outcome of co2 fixation minus the energetic costs of photosynthesis and nutrient uptake note that although pahlow et al 2013 also included phosphorus limitation and nitrogen fixation in their model for simplicity we here consider only nitrogen as the limiting nutrient there are three levels of optimization in the simplified pahlow model the first is the optimization of the chl c ratio within the chloroplast θ ˆ 0 to maximize net photosynthesis i e gross photosynthesis minus the cost of chlorophyll maintenance pahlow et al 2013 necessarily assumed that the net photosynthesis of a chloroplast is independent of nutrient levels but the number of chloroplasts within one cell is dependent on nitrogen availability by solving the gradient function of net photosynthesis of one chloroplast against θ ˆ 0 θ ˆ 0 can be solved as follows see pahlow et al 2013 for details 1 θ ˆ 0 1 ζ c h l μ 0 α c h l i 1 w 0 1 r m c h l μ 0 e 1 α c h l i ζ c h l μ 0 i f i i 0 θ ˆ 0 θ m i n i f i i 0 in which i is irradiance w m 2 αchl is the chlorophyll specific initial slope of photosynthesis irradiance p i curve ζchl is the cost of photosynthesis coefficient r m c h l is the cost of chl maintenance μ 0 is the phytoplankton potential carbon acquisition rate w 0 is the zero branch of the lambert w function i 0 ζ c h l r m c h l α c h l is the threshold light level for chlorophyll synthesis θmin is the minimal chlorophyll to carbon ratio equaling zero in pahlow et al 2013 both r m c h l and μ 0 are temperature dependent and are assumed to have the same temperature coefficient ep 2 μ 0 μ 0 e e p k 1 t 0 1 t where μ 0 is the phytoplankton potential carbon acquisition at the reference temperature t 0 288 k ep is the activation energy ev of phytoplankton growth k is the boltzmann constant 8 62 10 5 ev k 1 from eq 1 it is clear that light is the most important abiotic factor directly affecting θ ˆ 0 temperature also has some indirect less important effects as shown later θ ˆ 0 is a nonlinear function of light under high light it is beneficial for the phytoplankton cell to slow down chlorophyll synthesis to reduce the cost of photosynthesis because this reduces only slightly the rate of photosynthesis if light level is too low approaching or below i 0 however the phytoplankton cell has negligible photosynthesis and also needs to reduce θ ˆ 0 the second level of optimization is to balance the energy allocation between photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake pahlow and oschlies 2013 assumed that the total nitrogen of the phytoplankton cell is partitioned among three pools machineries of carbon acquisition and nitrogen uptake plus subsistence requirements the net relative growth of the cell equals to net photosynthesis of the whole cell minus the respiratory cost of nitrogen uptake by solving the gradient function of the net relative growth against the allocation factor fv for nitrogen uptake the optimal cellular nitrogen quota qn mol n mol c 1 can be calculated as pahlow and oschlies 2013 3 q n q s n 1 1 1 q s n μ ˆ i v ˆ n ζ n where q s n is the structural nitrogen quota and equals half of the minimal nitrogen quota q 0n as often reported in the literature v ˆ n is the potential nutrient uptake rate μ ˆ i is the light dependent growth rate after accounting for photosynthesis and chlorophyll maintenance ζ n represents the cost of nitrogen assimilation fv can be calculated from qn 4 f v q s n q n ζ n q n 2 q s n the chlorophyll to carbon ratio θ mol c gchl 1 of the whole cell can be calculated as 5 θ θ ˆ 0 1 q s n q n f v μ ˆ i is calculated following eq a2 in pahlow et al 2013 6 μ ˆ i μ 0 s i μ 0 s i r m c h l ζ c h l θ ˆ 0 where si is the degree of light saturation 7 s i 1 e α c h l θ ˆ 0 i μ 0 it can be seen from eq 3 that since μ ˆ i increases with light and v ˆ n increases with nitrogen qn should decrease with increasing light and increase with increasing nitrogen concentration the third level of optimization is with respect to the tradeoff between nutrient uptake on the cell surface and nutrient assimilation within the cell pahlow 2005 smith et al 2009 the potential nutrient uptake rate v ˆ n is calculated as 8 v ˆ n v 0 n n v 0 n a 0 n 2 v 0 n n a 0 n n in which v 0 n d 1 is the maximal potential nitrogen uptake rate a 0 n m3 mmol 1 d 1 is the maximal potential affinity n is ambient nitrogen concentration mmol m 3 both v 0 n and a 0 n share the same temperature dependence as r m c h l and μ 0 in eq 2 eq 8 differs from the michaelis menten equation in that the apparent half saturation constant increases with n smith et al 2009 finally phytoplankton net growth rate μ is calculated as 9 μ μ ˆ i 1 2 q s n q n note that although eq 9 is in the same form as the droop model droop 1974 as derived by pahlow and oschlies 2013 the nutrient term also depends on light level since qn depends on light 2 2 monod type model a traditional model that relates phytoplankton growth rate with external nutrient concentration light and temperature is the monod type model 10 μ μ m n n k n 1 e α c i μ m where kn is the half saturation constant of nitrogen for phytoplankton growth αc is the carbon specific slope of the growth irradiance curve μm differs from the μ0 in that it already takes into account algal respiration μm is also temperature dependent 11 μ m μ m e e p k 1 t 0 1 t note that because our intent was to directly calculate μ from abiotic environmental factors without introducing extra tracers such as chl a concentration there is no θ in eq 10 flynn 2003 noted that although eq 10 may less faithfully describe the light dependence of growth compared to other models such as in geider et al 1997 its predictions differ only slightly from other models at least when the temporal dynamics of photo acclimation are not the central focus following flynn 2003 θ can be calculated as 12 θ θ m i n μ i α c h l in which θ min represents the minimal chlorophyll to carbon ratio at very high light the maximal θ θ max can be achieved at minimal light and saturating nutrient conditions and can be derived following the l hôpital s rule 13 θ m a x θ m i n lim i 0 μ i α c h l θ m i n 1 α c h l lim i 0 μ m 1 e α c i μ m i θ m i n α c α c h l by substituting αchl in eq 13 into eq 12 we obtain 14 θ θ m i n μ i α c θ m a x θ m i n in which θ max can be imported from the pahlow model eq 5 note that eq 12 always holds if phytoplankton growth is limited by light acquisition instead of calvin cycle processes flynn 2003 the nutrient effect on θ is embedded within the nutrient dependence of μ the derived patterns of θ to light and nutrients are also consistent with other models cloern et al 1995 geider et al 1997 further by equating ambient nutrient dependent and internal quota dependent growth rates morel 1987 15 μ μ m n n k n μ m 1 q m i n q n 1 q m i n q m a x where q min is the minimal nitrogen quota 2qs n and q max is the maximal nitrogen quota and is assumed 3 times of q min litchman et al 2007 marañón et al 2013 qn can be calculated from eq 15 16 q n q m i n 1 1 q m i n q m a x n n k n as such our formulation of the monod model also allows to directly calculate θ and qn from external environmental nitrogen light and temperature thus both the pahlow and monod models share similar inputs i e temperature light inorganic nitrogen and outputs μ θ qn being able to provide estimates of flexible θ and qn assuming instantaneous acclimation without the necessity of computing the dynamics of independent tracers of cellular carbon and chlorophyll contents within phytoplankton cells fig 1 to allow similar parameterizations between both models we used an adaptive nonlinear least square regression to estimate the parameters i e μ m kn and αc of the monod model by fitting the growth rates of the monod model against the outputs of pahlow model under various light and nutrient conditions after selecting the parameters of the pahlow model fig 3 a and d this was implemented with the function nls with the port algorithm in r 3 3 2 dennis et al 1981 r core team 2016 2 3 analysis of laboratory data for phytoplankton chlorophyll to carbon and nitrogen to carbon ratios from five published studies falkowski and owens 1980 laws and bannister 1980 terry et al 1983 falkowski et al 1985 strzepek and price 2000 we compiled a dataset of θ and qn of nine phytoplankton taxa under light limiting conditions to validate the outputs of the two models we focus on θ and qn because the predictions of θ and qn under light limitation are the most striking contrasts between the pahlow and monod models the data for two of the nine taxa were used in pahlow et al 2013 to be consistent with the 1d model we converted all the light units to w m 2 by calculating the total daily photon doses assuming 1 w m 2 2 5 mol photons m 2 d 1 the light levels i were log transformed logi to reach a quasi normal distribution to see the general trend of θ and qn with light we used a linear mixed effect model to allow random deviations of both the slope and the intercept of qn logi because the relationship of θ with light could be nonlinear due to the trend of decreasing θ with decreasing light under dim light pahlow et al 2013 westberry et al 2016 we included a second order term of logi in the general linear mixed effect model of θ logi the linear mixed effect model was implemented using the package lme4 in r bates et al 2014 the parameters of the pahlow model shown in table 1 mostly followed pahlow et al 2013 some parameters particularly αchl and a 0n that are the most important traits determining the light and nutrient affinity can be species specific we used the parameters optimized from the one dimensional model to calculate θ and qn which were then contrasted with the laboratory data fig 4 2 4 one dimensional model to examine the performances of the two models under more realistic conditions we embedded the two phytoplankton models within a simple one dimensional 1d numerical model surface to 250 m depth implemented for two stations s1 145 e 30 n aloha 158 e 22 75 n in the north pacific fig 2a this 1d model contained four biological tracers dissolved inorganic nitrogen phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus for simplicity the physical variables relevant to biological processes i e temperature surface photosynthetically available radiance par 0 and vertical eddy diffusivity k v were imported from external data products and linearly interpolated for each time step and depth level chen and smith 2018 par 0 data were imported from seawifs satellite monthly climatology products seasonal temperature vertical profiles were imported from world ocean atlas 2013 monthly climatology the profiles of kv were imported from the output of an eddy permitting model for north pacific hashioka et al 2009 light levels iz at depth z were calculated based on par 0 and chl a concentrations following the beer lambert law 17 i z p a r 0 e z k w k c h l 0 z c h l x d x in which kw and kchl are the attenuation coefficients for seawater and chl a respectively however one problem with the eulerian framework is that the time for a phytoplankton cell to mix throughout the surface mixed layer ml is much less than its doubling time franks 2015 we therefore calculated the ambient light level for phytoplankton within the ml as the average light i throughout the ml the mixed layer depth mld is defined as the deepest depth with k v 10 3 m2 s 1 based on the equation τ l l 2 k z eq 1 in franks 2015 the average time τl for a phytoplankton cell to move at a distance l of 100 m at the local diffusivity k z of 10 3 m2 s 1 is roughly half a day as such we assumed that the phytoplankton cells within the ml should receive the average light throughout the ml i was used to calculate phytoplankton μ θ and qn for temporal evolution of phytoplankton biomass and also standing stocks of chl a this might cause a sharp transition of phytoplankton properties across the bottom of the ml however to compare with in situ net primary production npp estimates derived from incubation bottles that were not mixed during incubation phytoplankton μ θ and qn were recalculated from iz based on the beer lambert law thus npp depends directly on iz instead of i due to the inevitable incubation problem 18 n p p p μ n i z t q n n i z t phytoplankton sinking was assumed negligible due to the dominance of small phytoplankton at the two oligotrophic stations campbell et al 1997 fujiki et al 2016 only detritus was assumed to sink at a constant rate wd m d 1 zooplankton specific ingestion rate g d 1 of phytoplankton was described as a holling iii function 19a g g m e e z k 1 t 0 1 t p 2 p 2 k p 2 in which gm is the maximal ingestion rate d 1 e z is the activation energy ev of zooplankton grazing kp is the grazing half saturation constant μmol n m 3 of zooplankton we also tested holling i and ii

for station aloha the observational data were downloaded from the hawaii ocean time series website http hahana soest hawaii edu hot we pooled all the observational data into one climatological year assuming that seasonal changes of environmental conditions are the major factors determining changes in biological variables and inter annual variations are relatively less important in addition we estimated surface θ 9 km resolution from a seawifs monthly climatology http gdata1 sci gsfc nasa gov daac bin g3 gui cgi instance id ocean month by dividing phytoplankton carbon with chl a following

empirical relationship between poc and blue to green band reflectance ratio stramski et al 2008 for quantitative evaluations of model performances we calculated the sum of squared errors ssqe between the observational data and corresponding model predictions because the model started to converge to regular seasonal patterns from the second year we ran the model for three years and used the output of the final year to compare with observational data the model outputs were linearly interpolated to the observed depths and dates to allow comparisons among different data types and downplay the effects of extreme values both the model outputs and observational data were transformed to their 1 4 power and normalized between 0 and 1 to achieve a quasi normal distribution 21 s s q e k i j 1 n k

of delayed rejection adaptive metraopolis hastings monte carlo haario et al 2016 laine 2008 chen and smith 2018 then we obtained the parameters of the monod model by fitting the growth rate outputs of pahlow model to achieve similar parameterizations for the two models with this approach we expected that the pahlow model should perform better than the monod model albeit the difference should not be substantial we then conducted a sensitive analysis to investigate whether the choice of certain parameter values would alter the relative performances between the two models in particular we tested how the type of grazing functions and the values of αchl and a 0n affect the model results table 2 we varied the model parameters one by one holding other parameters the same as in the default run in table 1 we also limited the parameter values within realistic ranges noted in previous modeling studies fennel et al 2006 franks 2009 the notation and values of model parameters are shown in table 1 note that in preparation for future development of three dimensional ocean models we have intentionally applied the same set of parameters for the two stations the model fortran codes r scripts and results are available on https github com bingzhangchen citrate 3 results 3 1 comparisons of μ θ and qn between the pahlow and monod models both phytoplankton models estimate phytoplankton μ θ and qn based on ambient environmental temperature din concentrations and light the relationships between the growth rate and nitrogen light and temperature of the pahlow model when other resources are replete can be approximated by the monod model with slight departures fig 3a d g although the differences are small the pahlow model predicts a somewhat flatter transition of growth rate than the monod model as resource levels increase because θ declines with increasing light and the half saturation concentration for nitrogen uptake increases with increasing nutrient concentration smith et al 2009 for this reason the fitted value of kn for the monod model also depends on the nutrient range considered with the pahlow model considering a larger range of nutrient concentrations will yield a higher fitted value of kn the growth rates differ most between the two models when both nutrients and light levels are limiting fig 3 the pahlow model predicts higher growth rates at the same nutrient concentration than the monod model when light is limiting and also predicts higher growth rates under the same light level when nutrient is limiting when nutrient or light is limiting the pahlow model also predicts that the growth rate increases faster with temperature than the monod model the two models also predict different values of θ under low light fig 3b e h when the light deceases from high values the pahlow model predicts an increasing θ with decreasing light and then a decreasing trend of θ when the light approaches the threshold value fig 3e this is particularly evident when light is plotted on a log scale fig 4 by contrast the monod model predicts that θ decreases strictly monotonically with decreasing light the pahlow model also predicts that θ increases with temperature faster than the monod model when light is limiting for qn although both models predict that qn values increase with ambient n the pahlow model predicts that qn values should increase with decreasing light levels while qn values do not vary with light in the monod model fig 3c f as such under low light the pahlow model predicts higher qn values than the monod model the pahlow model also predicts that qn values increase with temperature when light is limiting while the monod model predicts that qn is independent of temperature 3 2 comparisons with laboratory data analysis of laboratory data for phytoplankton qn reveals a significant decreasing trend of qn with increasing light when nutrients are replete fixed effect t 3 69 p 0 001 although this trend varies among taxa fig 4a for θ the second order term of the linear mixed effect model is significantly negative t 4 26 p 0 001 suggesting that the decreasing trend of θ with decreasing light under dim light is real fig 4b thus in general the pahlow model shows better qualitative fits to the patterns of qn and θ in laboratory experiments although the pahlow model underestimates θ under dim light 3 3 1d model before comparing the modeled biological variables with in situ observations we ensured the validity of the external physical forcing the mlds estimated from modeled profiles of k v fit well with observations at the two stations fig 2 station s1 shows the typical vertical mixing pattern in the subtropics with more vigorous mixing in the winter and stratification in the summer fig 2b the mixed layer depth reaches nearly 200 m in february and march after april the mixed layer rapidly shoals to around 15 m until august and then deepens again temperatures in the surface mixed layer vary from 18 c in february and march to 27 c in august and september fig 2d the surface par ranges from 19 to 54 mol photons d 1 m 2 equivalent to 47 5 to 135 w m 2 fig 2f compared to station s1 the seasonal variation of mixing at station aloha is less drastic although the winter mixing is still stronger than during summer fig 2c the surface mixed layer exhibits weak mixing throughout the whole year the mixing difference between s1 and aloha is also reflected in the vertical profiles of temperature in which the seasonal variations of surface temperature are less pronounced at aloha than at s1 fig 2e the surface par in general is slightly stronger at aloha than at s1 fig 2g both models are able to simulate the general pattern of high din in the winter and the subsequent drawdown of nutrients in the surface mixed layer from winter to summer at s1 fig 5 a however the monod model overestimates the surface din at station aloha fig 5b the superiority of the pahlow model in modeling din is also indicated by its smaller ssqe table 2 both models are also able to reproduce the general seasonal patterns of chl a concentrations and npp in the surface mixed layer at s1 fig 5 at aloha however the pahlow model underestimates chl in surface waters while the monod model agrees better with chl a observations fig 5d table 2 both models underestimate surface npp at aloha fig 5f examination of the seasonal vertical profiles at station s1 suggests that the modeled nutriclines are shallower than observed during summer and fall for both models fig 6 c d the two models also well reproduce the subsurface chlorophyll maximum scm layer compared to the pahlow model the monod model predicts higher chl a concentrations below the scm because of its higher predicted θ value under low light fig 6f h the pattern of higher chl a below scm in the monod model than the pahlow model is also evident at station aloha fig 7 e h both models generate an unrealistic subsurface peak of npp during summer at s1 fig 6k while both models particularly the pahlow model underestimate npp in surface waters at aloha fig 7i l quantitative comparisons based on ssqe yield mixed results for different variables table 2 the pahlow model simulates din better than the monod model at both stations while the converse is true for chl and npp particularly at aloha where the problem is mainly due to the pahlow model s underestimation of chl near the surface sensitivity analysis suggests that changing the type of grazing functional response severely deteriorates the performance of the models with other parameters unchanged table 2 reducing αchl to half of its original value makes the model fits worse than the standard run for din and chl at both stations the only improvement is for npp at s1 conversely if αchl is increased to twice its original value i e making light limitation less likely the fits of both models to din improve at both stations due to the increased nutrient uptake while the fit to chl worsens at aloha because the low din cannot support sufficient phytoplankton biomass compared to station aloha this change of parameter value improves the fitting for both din and chl at station s1 and only the fits for npp worsen changing the nutrient affinity a 0n barely affects the results of the pahlow model because of its dynamic acclimation response but substantially affects the performance of the monod model which lacks this acclimation response it is informative to directly compare μ θ and qn from the 1d model outputs between the two models within the surface mixed layer of s1 the monod model gives slower growth rate during the winter when mixing is more intense and light is more limiting than other seasons fig 8 a at station aloha the pahlow model predicts lower growth rate due to the lower din concentration fig 8b the pahlow model predicts higher values of θ and qn than the monod model during winter fig 8c f compared to the satellite derived estimates of θ both models predict higher values in winter and lower values in summer at s1 but underestimate it at aloha both models give lower qn values compared to the observed particulate n c ratios particularly during summer we also show the comprehensive modeled patterns of μ θ and qn at both stations fig 9 one noticeable difference between the two models is that the pahlow model predicts higher growth rate than the monod model in deeper waters and also in winter at s1 which reduces the upward nutrient diffusive flux and leads to lower chl a and npp at the surface figs 5 7 a more prominent difference is that the pahlow model predicts low θ values fig 9 in deep layers when light is negligible pahlow et al 2013 which does not occur with the monod model the pahlow model also predicts significantly higher qn values than the monod model exceeding the canonic redfield n c ratio in deep waters fig 9 a comparison of computation efficiency suggests that the pahlow model can cost 2 times of computation time than the monod model when we used intel fortran compiler with the compiler option fast on a macos sierra 10 12 5 i386 processor a single run of the pahlow model at station aloha took 0 071 min around 2 times of the monod model 0 036 min 4 discussion optimality based models which account for organisms ability to acclimate to external environmental conditions have been deemed a novel approach to faithfully represent biological mechanisms without compromising computational efficiency with the potential to be widely applied in 3d gcms follows and dutkiewicz 2011 smith et al 2011 2014 ward 2017 here we have compared the optimality based pahlow model and a computationally more efficient and more widely used monod model by examining the functional relationships between three key phytoplankton quantities μ qn and θ and environmental factors and testing whether both of them can well simulate the observed patterns in two subtropical stations these comparisons not only provide deep understandings of the model performances but also suggest new directions for future ocean observations we find that the relationships between μ and nutrient and light with the optimality based pahlow model can be fairly well approximated by the widely used monod model by parameter fitting although the modeled growth rates differ noticeably under light limiting conditions fig 3 this concurs with previous arguments that simple models can well approximate the results of complicated photo acclimation models flynn 2003 however here we have assessed these two models only at two contrasting subtropical stations which provides a stringent but limited test of their performance which can be expected to differ even more in applications over a wider range of environmental conditions such as in 3d regional and global models compared to the monod model the faster growth rates of the pahlow model under low light allow phytoplankton to consume more nutrients at the scm yielding lower levels of surface nitrate and chl this effect may be overly strong contributing to the pahlow model s underestimates of surface din and chl at station aloha fig 5 it is noteworthy that the ubiquitous and ecologically important prochlorococcus might have lost the capacity of photo acclimation partensky et al 1999 and if so the pahlow model may be unsuitable for modeling prochlorococcus however the pahlow model predicts qualitatively different patterns of qn and θ compared to our modified monod model which also gives dynamic estimates of these quantities these differences cannot be eliminated simply by parameter tuning if it can be proven that the patterns generated by the pahlow model are in fact more realistic than those from the monod model this would favor use of the pahlow model in gcms rather than tinkering with existing monod type models based on compilations of laboratory data for phytoplankton qn and θ under light limiting conditions fig 4 the pahlow model does perform better in terms of the increasing trend of qn with light limitation and the unimodal relationship between θ and light these unique patterns may support the validity of its underlying biological assumption that phytoplankton cells optimize their internal resource allocation to achieve maximal fitness constrained by the assumed tradeoff between photosynthesis and nutrient uptake these assumptions were also similarly supported by armstrong 2006 interestingly goldman 1986 argued that light should not directly affect qn which justifies that the extent of nutrient limitation can be quantified based on qn alone without considering light our compiled data suggests that light can indeed affect qn contradicting goldman s argument and suggesting that in order to evaluate the status of phytoplankton nutrient limitation light should be taken into account in other words similar n c ratios observed in phytoplankton cells under different light environments do not suggest that these cells are experiencing similar extents of nutrient limitation at high latitudes where light may be more limiting than at low latitudes phytoplankton cells need more nitrogen to synthesize light harvesting proteins and pigments klausmeier et al 2004 armstrong 2006 pahlow et al 2013 this also implies that light should be considered when searching for patterns of nutrient related traits for phytoplankton litchman et al 2007 edwards et al 2012 however the pahlow model is not perfect either it strongly underestimates θ under very low light as is apparent from fig 4b although phytoplankton θ can have a decreasing trend with decreasing light for par less than around 1 w m 2 there are no observed θ values lower than 0 24 gchl mol c 1 50 gc gchl 1 as the pahlow model predicts the model estimates of θ and qn are not less important than growth rate μ because chl and npp involve combined calculations of all three outputs i e μ θ and qn from the phytoplankton models it is possible that some model might be better in fitting chl or npp with the wrong combination of phytoplankton biomass in terms of nitrogen p μ θ and qn eq 18 the variations of θ are also critical for assessing the response of ocean primary production to environmental change from satellite observations which offer us unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage behrenfeld et al 2015 westberry et al 2016 the ideal approach to evaluate the phytoplankton models is to directly measure p μ θ and qn in the field currently direct measurements of θ and qn in the field are emerging but remain insufficient in both quantity and quality to distinguish between even the substantially different predictions of the two models considered herein graff et al 2012 2015 we urge that more measurements should be made particularly in the lower euphotic layer because such observations would be very useful for testing model performance and advancing understanding of phytoplankton physiology it is intriguing that the observed ratios of particulate organic nitrogen pon to poc at stations aloha and s1 in deep waters are less than those predicted by the pahlow model and closer to the redfield ratio fig 10 if we trust the qn predicted by the pahlow model a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy between phytoplankton qn and pon poc ratios in surface waters might be that microzooplankton have higher n c ratios than phytoplankton talmy et al 2016 in deeper waters however the modeled phytoplankton n c ratios even exceed the measured pon poc ratios which can only be reconciled if the n c ratios of other pools such as bacteria zooplankton or detritus are much lower than the redfield ratio to offset the high phytoplankton n c ratio this hypothesis remains to be validated 5 conclusions the original intent of this study was to use the classic monod type model to approximate the optimality based model of pahlow et al 2013 to further simplify and speed up computation both models assume instantaneous acclimation and therefore allow direct calculations of phytoplankton growth rate chlorophyll to carbon and nitrogen to carbon ratios from ambient environmental nitrogen light and temperature which circumvents the need to assign multiple tracers for the same phytoplankton population while both models can reproduce the field observations to some extent we find that even though we tuned the parameters of the monod model to the outputs of the pahlow model three features remain unique to the pahlow model the first is that phytoplankton can achieve higher growth rates in the pahlow model than in the monod model when they are under light limitation the second is that phytoplankton n c ratios depend on light availability with the pahlow model via its assumed tradeoff between photosynthesis and nutrient uptake this dependence was stressed previously by armstrong 2006 based on a single study laws and bannister 1980 and we have found further evidence for it based on a larger dataset including data for nine taxa the third is that with the pahlow model phytoplankton chlorophyll to carbon ratios decrease with decreasing light under dim light this is also partially corroborated by laboratory data although uncertainties remain and field data are sparse the commonly used monod model cannot easily reproduce all three of these observed patterns we therefore conclude that some essential postulates of the optimality based pahlow model such as the tradeoff between photosynthesis and nutrient uptake may be useful and even indispensable features that need to be considered in ocean biogeochemical models however we also identified some weakness of the pahlow model such as the underestimation of θ under very low light conditions which may account for its inability to outperform the monod model in the 1d simulations table 2 finally we urge for more direct measurements of phytoplankton biomass in terms of carbon and nitrogen specific growth rates chlorophyll to carbon and nitrogen to carbon ratios

environment and new resources trondheim norway sintef ocean environment and new resources trondheim norway corresponding author graphical abstract atlantic cod gadus morhua is a commercially important species and therefore understanding the influence of environmental factors and anthropogenic stressors on its early life stages is of considerable relevance in this contribution we apply a simple and generic energy budget framework debkiss to data for the yolk feeding stages of cod the model is capable of explaining the changes in yolk volume dry weight oxygen use and body length simultaneously with a small number of parameters the calibrated model was subsequently successfully tested with other data sets interestingly the light conditions after hatching affect growth and respiration rates which is traced to a change in the maintenance costs linked to swimming activity despite the satisfactory performance of the model several uncertainties remain especially the bioenergetics around the point of complete yolk absorption require further attention which is complicated by the fact that the behaviour around this point differed between data sets the presented model can be used for exploring effects of stressors on early life stages of cod and likely for other aquatic egg laying species as well keywords energy budget debkiss gadus morhua embryonic development modelling yolk absorption 1 introduction atlantic cod gadus morhua is a fish species of substantial economic importance and therefore there is considerable interest in the effects of environmental factors and stressors such as temperature and xenobiotics on its life history the early life stages of fish are crucial for recruitment of both natural and cultured fish stocks kamler 2008 and are regularly specifically sensitive to chemical stress see e g petersen and kristensen 1998 massei et al 2015 interpreting understanding and ultimately predicting stressor effects on the life history requires bioenergetic models jager et al 2013 in all animals food is used to fuel the energy demanding processes of maintenance activity growth development and reproduction in doing so the individual needs to obey the conservation laws for mass and energy which helps to structure the modelling efforts the yolk feeding stages are of particular interest from a bioenergetic viewpoint as most of them can be considered as semi closed systems heming and buddington 1988 practically all of the energy that the developing embryo uses for its development is locked inside the egg in the form of endogenous yolk this makes them ideal objects to study the effects of environmental factors and stresses on their energy budget specific bioenergetic models have been proposed for fish development over the yolk feeding stages beer and anderson 1997 jaworski and kamler 2002 but we aim for a more general treatment embedding the yolk stages into the rest of the life cycle and linking fish to other animal species dynamic energy budget deb theory jusup et al 2017 sousa et al 2010 offers such a generic and inclusive bioenergetics representation covering the entire life cycle from egg to death for all forms of life the debkiss framework jager et al 2013 jager 2016 is derived from deb theory by applying several simplifications to ease parameterisation interpretation and practical applications such as in interpreting the effects of chemical stress barsi et al 2014 and ocean acidification jager et al 2016 the most prominent simplification in debkiss is the removal of reserve as a state variable in the model for many applications this turns out to be an acceptable simplification see list of papers at http www debtox info debkiss appl html the result is a simple model for bioenergetics of ectothermic animals over their entire life cycle including the embryonic stages jager et al 2013 barsi et al 2014 however for eggs the removal of reserve required some additional thought deb theory considers the yolk as part of the reserve and clearly no model for embryo bioenergetics can work without a state variable that considers yolk in debkiss yolk is treated as a buffer handed over by the mother to the egg which is assimilated in a similar fashion as assimilation of food by the free swimming feeding stages this assumption is quite similar to the assumptions made for yolk absorption by beer and anderson 1997 and jaworski and kamler 2002 to test the performance of the simple debkiss model for egg development and yolk feeding we apply it to data for the atlantic cod once parameterised and tested this model may prove to be useful to interpret and predict the effects of environmental changes and stressor effects on the yolk feeding stages of cod as the debkiss model is generic it can then likely be applied to other fish species and even other egg laying animals as well 2 methods 2 1 basic model for embryos a detailed description of debkiss can be found elsewhere jager et al 2013 jager 2016 below a summary is given as far as relevant for the early life stages reproduction is excluded from the model description here the model structure for these stages is schematically shown in fig 1 and all symbols used in this study are summarised in table 1 note that in deb terminology the embryo is the initial stage of the life cycle where the animal does not feed exogeneously and the juvenile stage starts with the ability to feed exogeneously the points of hatching and metamorphosis the end of the larval stage are not stage switches from an energetic viewpoint over its early development the embryo goes through a series of events for cod described in detail by hall et al 2004 these events represent major changes in morphology of the embryo but for our debkiss model all this detail will be ignored the egg is treated as consisting of two state variables the mass of the egg buffer w b representing the yolk and the mass of structure w v representing the embryo or larvae without the yolk sac the egg buffer is assimilated at a rate j a and structural mass increases with a growth flux j v 1 d dt w b j a until w b 0 with w b 0 w b 0 2 d dt w v j v with w v 0 w v 0 to facilitate the links between mass surface area and body length it is practical to work with volumetric length l which is the cubic root of structural volume using the dry weight density d v volumetric length can in turn be linked to more practical length measures l w e g standard length sl in fish by a shape correction coefficient δ m 3 l 3 w v d v and l w l δ m reported water content for cod larvae 4 5 10 mm sl is around 85 finn et al 2002 this implies that we can use d v 0 15 mg mm3 as a reasonable estimate for the density of structure in our calibration data set finn et al 1995 yolk is expressed as a volume and hence we also need a dry weight density for the egg buffer d b we leave this as a free parameter to be estimated in the fit to the data as we have no direct information on the yolk properties measurements on total fresh eggs finn et al 1995 suggest a value close to 0 07 mg mm3 next we need to fill in the mass fluxes for the various processes the assimilation flux j a is proportional to a surface area of the animal and the maintenance flux j m to a volume a fraction κ of the assimilation flux is used with a certain efficiency y va for growth j v the remainder here denoted as j h is assumed to be dissipated in the deb context the flux j h is used for maturity and maturity maintenance even though these processes are not explicitly followed here specification of this flux is needed to close the mass balance and for the calculation of respiration rates later on the mass fluxes are defined as follows 4 j a f j am a l 2 if w b 0 then f 1 5 j m j m v l 3 6 j v y va κ j a j m 7 j h 1 κ j a the scaled functional response f is included in the assimilation flux j a and is a function of food availability 1 represents ad libitum conditions and 0 complete starvation for yolk feeding stages we assume f 1 until yolk runs out however what happens when the larva starts to feed exogeneously the larvae obtain the ability to feed after development of a functional jaw and hindgut hall et al 2004 which is generally before the yolk is fully exhausted kamler 2008 heming and buddington 1988 this implies that we at some point need to consider two food sources we leave the question of mixed feeding open at the moment as no food was offered to the animals in the experiments that we use the resulting instantaneous switch from f 1 to f 0 is unrealistic in detail in practice we will likely see a smoother transition from yolk feeding to starvation 2 2 response to starvation and temperature when the allocated assimilation flux κj a is insufficient to cover the maintenance costs j m the animal needs to deviate from the rules provided above jager et al 2013 proposed a simple model to deal with this problem in two stages see supporting information here we can simplify the model to a single stage as we assumed an instantaneous switch from f 1 to f 0 when yolk runs out in the absence of yolk or external food the animal will shrink i e use structural tissue to pay the maintenance cost 8 j v j m y av and j h 0 shrinking negative value for j v implies that w v will decrease but not necessarily l w if we use standard length as our size measure it will be determined by the length of the notochord which is unlikely capable of shrinking temperature is clearly an important factor for the bioenergetics and increasing the temperature speeds up development geffen et al 2006 in deb applications it is generally assumed that all rate constants with a dimension that includes per time scale in the same way with temperature we can use the arrhenius relationship to scale from a reference temperature t to the actual temperature t both in kelvin all rate constants have to be multiplied by 9 f t exp t a t t a t where t a is the arrhenius temperature in kelvin lika et al 2011 suggest a value of 8000 k as typical value 2 3 link between mass fluxes and oxygen use measurements of oxygen use provide valuable insights into the bioenergetics of the yolk feeding stages they are easier to interpret than measurements on the externally feeding stages the embryos continue all of the regular metabolic work during the measurement of oxygen use as they have a constant supply of energy in contrast feeding stages will usually be fasted for some time before measurement with unclear consequences for the bioenergetics see jager and ravagnan 2016 oxygen use is related to the mass fluxes that dissipate the total dissipation flux j d as relevant in the context of the early life stages is given by 10 j d j m j h j vo where j vo indicates the overhead costs for growth or shrinking 11 j vo j v 1 y va y va if j v 0 j v y av 1 if j v 0 the dissipation flux is a mass flux in mg of assimilates per day in practice respiration is often expressed in terms of oxygen use to convert this mass flux to moles of oxygen we need the carbon content of biomass or yolk for the species d c we take 0 4 mg mg 1 as a representative value the molar mass of carbon 12 g mol and the respiratory quotient f rq this quotient is the moles of co2 and thus also the moles of c eliminated per mole of o2 taken up we take 0 8 as a reasonable value for our validation study we need to convert moles of oxygen further to microliters which requires the molar mass of oxygen 32 g mol and its density 1 43 g l at 0 c 2 4 implementation and calibration the model was implemented in matlab using the generic byom platform http www debtox info byom html optimisation was performed by maximising an overall likelihood function assuming normally distributed and independent errors confidence intervals were calculated by profiling the likelihood all data were extracted from the original publications using the freeware plotreader http jornbr home xs4all nl plotreader the data are used in the form and with the units as given in the original publications the model outputs w b w v and j d were recalculated to match the type and unit of the data set this is done to keep the data points unaffected by the uncertainty in the transformations the only recalculation is the reconstruction of yolk dry weight in the data sets of solberg and tilseth 1984 1987 from the weights determined in those studies see sections 2 5 and 2 6 we selected the data set from finn et al 1995 to calibrate the model as it contains measurements on different endpoints from the same group of animals yolk volume dry weights standard length after hatch and respiration rate the experiments were perfomed at 6 c with the eggs initially kept under continuous light but switching to a 14 10 light dark regime post hatching the measured dry weight of the complete egg requires some further thought as this measurement includes contributions from the yolk the structural part of the embryo and the chorion of the egg for the chorion we take a fixed value of 0 020 mg based on the measurements of solberg and tilseth 1984 for the respiration data two series of measurements were presented one in light and one in dark conditions for the egg stage and several days after hatching these measurements were very similar but around the time that yolk ran out a profound difference was observed a square root transformation was applied for this data set to increase the importance of the initial respiration measurements of the early egg stages and decrease the importance of the post hatching measurements which is useful in view of the variation induced by light conditions 2 5 model testing to test the model and its parameterisation a second independent data set solberg and tilseth 1984 was used as model corroboration these authors report measurements of dry weights of chorion total egg whole larvae incl yolk larvae with dissected yolk as well as standard length post hatch these experiments were performed at 5 c under a 12 12 hour light regime and used two batches of eggs from different females since these experiments were done at a slightly different temperature 5 c instead of 6 c we calculated a temperature correction factor eq 9 which is applied to both rate constants specific assimilation and specific maintenance rates the initial amount of yolk w b0 was calculated from the mean weight of the total fresh egg in this study 0 107 mg minus the chorion and the value of w v0 table 1 additionally the same study reports some respiration data post hatching from other batches of eggs we added the respiration data from serigstad and adoff 1985 which covers the egg stage as well also performed at 5 c for all respiration data sets we do not have the corresponding development of larval and yolk mass for the same batches of eggs which implies additional uncertainty 2 6 effects of light and temperature solberg and tilseth 1984 1987 also report an experiment with hatched larvae reared under different temperatures 3 5 and 7 c and light conditions constant darkness or constant light total dry weight dry weight of larvae with dissected yolk and standard length were reported initial amounts of yolk and structure were fixed to the first measurements shortly after hatching these data only have information for the end of the yolk feeding stage and the subsequent starvation phase we fitted both the specific assimilation rate and the specific maintenance rate on each treatment κ was fixed to the value established in the calibration see table 1 and only show the parameter estimates fits are provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the model fit to the calibration data finn et al 1995 is shown in fig 2 the four data sets are fitted simultaneously with only seven parameters an average of less than two parameters per data set parameter estimates with confidence intervals are given in table 1 the model itself has only three parameters that need to be fitted additionally there are two initial states initial mass of structure and yolk that need to be estimated as well as two conversion factors to link state variables mass to observations yolk volume and standard length note that the estimate for the density of yolk is very close to the value estimated from the total fresh egg 0 07 mg mm3 finn et al 1995 overall the fit is very good but several issues can be observed on closer inspection starting with the total dry weight fig 2d the model predicts a decrease of total dry weight over the egg stage which is not shown in the data as the egg membrane severely restricts uptake of solutes the burning of yolk mass flux j d should lead to a loss of dry weight as the embryo develops closely linked to the observed respiration rate eggs may be taking up some minerals from water but no increase in ash content was observed in this study finn et al 1995 further eggs and larvae appear to be capable of absorbing dissolved organic molecules from water although the contribution to the mass and energy budget is expected to be negligible heming and buddington 1988 a decrease in total egg weight was observed in the validation data set solberg and tilseth 1984 so the lack of a decrease here could represent a measurement bias the respiration rate fig 2c is nicely fitted up to the point where the yolk runs out at that point there is also a clear difference between the respiration rate measured in light and in dark conditions the model predicts a sharp drop in respiration rate when yolk runs out as the scaled functional response switches instantly from f 1 to f 0 as a result of this transition to complete starvation growth switches to shrinking to match the maintenance needs which leads to a lower total dissipation flux as starvation progresses respiration decreases as also the total amount of structure to be maintained decreases this pattern is in general consistent with the data although there is a considerable difference between the respiration data in light and dark conditions the animals in the light clearly have a higher respiration rate after complete yolk absorption than predicted which can be linked to an increased swimming activity see solberg and tilseth 1984 the role of swimming activity in the energy budget is discussed further in section 3 3 the increase in standard length over time fig 2a is well matched by the model note that animals cannot shrink in length even though they do shrink in dry weight however growth seems to increase for slightly longer than predicted this might be caused by experimental difficulties of accurately measuring yolk volume close to the point of complete resorption it is also possible that some resources have already been irreversibly allocated to length increase notochord growth the estimate for κ is very high virtually all of the assimilated energy from yolk is used for maintenance and growth this value is linked to the fixed value for the growth efficiency y va and to the estimated specific maintenance rate j m v which in turn relies on the assumption that the shrinking of the larvae is linked to the maintenance requirements only given that the specific assimilation rate is severely restricted by the observed yolk absorption these three parameters κ y va and j m v determine the three fluxes contributing to dissipation see eq 10 and hence the efficiency with which yolk is turned into structural biomass for example assuming a higher growth efficiency y va 0 90 allows κ to decrease κ 0 93 with very little effect on the goodness of fit it will be difficult in practice to determine the value of the yield coefficients although this is unlikely to affect practical applications of the model the estimated value for the specific maintenance rate is very similar to the values established for two krill species jager and ravagnan 2016 when using the same reference temperature assuming an arrhenius temperature of 8000 k the specific assimilation rate is however lower which is surprising as cod will obviously grow to much larger sizes than krill maximum volumetric length is determined by κ j am a j m v the solution to this conundrum lies in the fact that fish accelerate metabolically after the start of feeding kooijman et al 2011 which involves an increase of the specific assimilation rate for some time after yolk has disappeared this allows these species to reach much larger sizes than indicated by their embryonic stage and also explains the deviation from von bertalanffy growth when early stages are included in the growth curve such an acceleration of growth relative to von bertalanffy growth was observed for larval cod by otterlei et al 1999 as a clear up curving for the length age relationship 3 2 model testing next the parameterised model is tested with data from solberg and tilseth 1984 the correspondence between model and data is quite convincing fig 3 especially given the fact that no parameters are fitted interestingly development in this study and for the additional respiration data from serigstad and adoff 1985 in panel c was somewhat slower than in the calibration study fig 2 hatching took place around day 18 compared to day 16 in the calibration study and complete yolk absorption after 24 days or even later compared to 21 days in the calibration furthermore the final stage of yolk resorption seems to be somewhat slower than predicted from the model fig 3b it appears that the transition from ad libitum yolk feeding to complete starvation is more gentle than assumed in the model also growth in length fig 3a continues for a while longer than predicted these deviations from the model predictions were not observed to the same extent in the calibration data set fig 2 it is tempting to include smoothing mechanisms such as the internal reserve compartment of the standard deb model sousa et al 2010 or a limitation of the assimilation flux by the surface area of the yolk sac see beer and anderson 1997 and supporting information however such mechanisms are inconsistent with the rather rapid transition in respiration rate when yolk disappears fig 2c and were also not as clear in other batches of eggs from solberg and tilseth 1984 see supporting information more detailed data on growth and respiration would be needed to settle this question the respiration data from different batches of eggs batch d h in fig 3c are not well matched by the model prediction before final yolk absorption the data are overestimated and afterwards underestimated the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear the data set from serigstad and adoff 1985 with larvae reared under continuous light or darkness shows a pattern that better matches the model predictions although the data are shifted to the right as already mentioned interestingly the respiration data for constant light show a closer resemblance to the pattern predicted by the model hence the model suggests that respiration rates are depressed in darkness rather than being stimulated by light respiration rates are however difficult to interpret without measurements for yolk and structural mass on the same group of animals we can now also use the model to predict embryonic development under other conditions for example we can predict how the duration of yolk feeding will change with egg size model simulation shows that yolk feeding will be extended by a factor of 1 4 longer for a doubling of the yolk content which is well in line with the factor of 1 3 mentioned by heming and buddington 1988 for cod and herring 3 3 effect of temperature and light the last data sets we used are also from solberg and tilseth 1984 1987 but consider only the changes in yolk weight larval weight and sl post hatching in absence of food these experiments were performed at three temperatures and at constant light or constant darkness all six data sets were fitted and the fitted parameters are plotted in fig 4 individual fits shown in supporting information the values for the specific maintenance rate are well in line with the value determined earlier for 6 c table 1 the calibrated value is in between the estimates for total light and total darkness however the specific assimilation rates are roughly half of what was estimated from the calibration data this is likely linked to a slower use of the final portion of the yolk as discussed above these six data sets only follow the larvae when the yolk is already almost exhausted specific assimilation rates are somewhat lower in the light but the confidence intervals mostly overlap however for the specific maintenance rate there is a clearly elevated rate constant on average 42 across the tested temperatures in the light at all temperatures as shown in fig 2c and 3 c animals kept in the light also showed higher respiration rates which is likely linked to their higher swimming activity solberg and tilseth 1984 thus we can infer that swimming activity shows up in the energy budget as a component of the maintenance rate since maintenance costs compete with growth and cause shrinking when the yolk has run out they show up in the pattern of structural body mass over time in deb models the maintenance rate is generally taken as a constant lumping the energy requirements for tissue maintenance and activity sousa et al 2010 this assumption may need some more detailed consideration especially for fish larvae experiencing a diurnal cycle fig 4 also shows an arrhenius relationship going through the mean value of each rate constant at 5 c the increase in the rate constants from 3 5 c is consistent with this prediction but there is no further increase to be observed from 5 7 c the reason for this lack of temperature effect is unclear but may relate to experimental problems interestingly the data on hatching time provided in the same paper do show a smoothly decreasing relationship with temperature as do the data sets provided in geffen et al 2006 over a much wider temperature range 4 conclusions we applied the generic energy budget model debkiss to extensive data for early life stages of cod in general this simple model provided an excellent explanation of the data sets some aspects in some of the data indicate the presence of a smoothing mechanism delayed response of length growth to yolk depletion and decreased absorption rates when the yolk sac is very small but the rather rapid response of the respiration rate on yolk exhaustion argues against it clearly all models are wrong in detail and simple models like energy budget approaches obviously lack many of the morphological e g hall et al 2004 and biochemical e g finn et al 1995 details in the end the utility of these models must be judged in light of the specific application for which they are used the applications that we envisage for this model are in the interpretation and prediction of the effects of combinations of environmental factors and stressors on embryonic development the type of application that we specifically consider is in the interpretation of toxicity tests with embryos this is particularly pertinent as toxicity tests with embryonic fish are increasingly being used as alternatives for testing with subsequent and legally protected life stages e g embry et al 2010 even though more detailed evaluation will be needed work on the effects of acetone on pond snail eggs barsi et al 2014 already provided substantial support to apply the model to toxicants it needs to be extended with a toxicokinetics module for eggs and yolk feeding larval stages this requires special consideration for example the rate of chemical exchange for the egg stage is considerably slower than for the larvae post hatching petersen and kristensen 1998 and yolk and structure may differ in their affinity for chemicals see jager 2016 furthermore there may also be stage specific mechanisms of toxicity in the early life stages see e g massei et al 2015 it should however be noted that energy budget models are of little help in the interpretation of non energy related endpoints such as malformations nevertheless such endpoints will still require knowledge on toxicokinetics and it is likely that toxicokinetics is affected by the patterns of structural and yolk mass over time in this study we only considered the yolk feeding stages however it is good to realise that debkiss is a model for the full life cycle of animals full life cycle bioenergetic models have a range of potential applications

environment and new resources trondheim norway sintef ocean environment and new resources trondheim norway corresponding author graphical abstract atlantic cod gadus morhua is a commercially important species and therefore understanding the influence of environmental factors and anthropogenic stressors on its early life stages is of considerable relevance in this contribution we apply a simple and generic energy budget framework debkiss to data for the yolk feeding stages of cod the model is capable of explaining the changes in yolk volume dry weight oxygen use and body length simultaneously with a small number of parameters the calibrated model was subsequently successfully tested with other data sets interestingly the light conditions after hatching affect growth and respiration rates which is traced to a change in the maintenance costs linked to swimming activity despite the satisfactory performance of the model several uncertainties remain especially the bioenergetics around the point of complete yolk absorption require further attention which is complicated by the fact that the behaviour around this point differed between data sets the presented model can be used for exploring effects of stressors on early life stages of cod and likely for other aquatic egg laying species as well keywords energy budget debkiss gadus morhua embryonic development modelling yolk absorption 1 introduction atlantic cod gadus morhua is a fish species of substantial economic importance and therefore there is considerable interest in the effects of environmental factors and stressors such as temperature and xenobiotics on its life history the early life stages of fish are crucial for recruitment of both natural and cultured fish stocks kamler 2008 and are regularly specifically sensitive to chemical stress see e g petersen and kristensen 1998 massei et al 2015 interpreting understanding and ultimately predicting stressor effects on the life history requires bioenergetic models jager et al 2013 in all animals food is used to fuel the energy demanding processes of maintenance activity growth development and reproduction in doing so the individual needs to obey the conservation laws for mass and energy which helps to structure the modelling efforts the yolk feeding stages are of particular interest from a bioenergetic viewpoint as most of them can be considered as semi closed systems heming and buddington 1988 practically all of the energy that the developing embryo uses for its development is locked inside the egg in the form of endogenous yolk this makes them ideal objects to study the effects of environmental factors and stresses on their energy budget specific bioenergetic models have been proposed for fish development over the yolk feeding stages beer and anderson 1997 jaworski and kamler 2002 but we aim for a more general treatment embedding the yolk stages into the rest of the life cycle and linking fish to other animal species dynamic energy budget deb theory jusup et al 2017 sousa et al 2010 offers such a generic and inclusive bioenergetics representation covering the entire life cycle from egg to death for all forms of life the debkiss framework jager et al 2013 jager 2016 is derived from deb theory by applying several simplifications to ease parameterisation interpretation and practical applications such as in interpreting the effects of chemical stress barsi et al 2014 and ocean acidification jager et al 2016 the most prominent simplification in debkiss is the removal of reserve as a state variable in the model for many applications this turns out to be an acceptable simplification see list of papers at http www debtox info debkiss appl html the result is a simple model for bioenergetics of ectothermic animals over their entire life cycle including the embryonic stages jager et al 2013 barsi et al 2014 however for eggs the removal of reserve required some additional thought deb theory considers the yolk as part of the reserve and clearly no model for embryo bioenergetics can work without a state variable that considers yolk in debkiss yolk is treated as a buffer handed over by the mother to the egg which is assimilated in a similar fashion as assimilation of food by the free swimming feeding stages this assumption is quite similar to the assumptions made for yolk absorption by beer and anderson 1997 and jaworski and kamler 2002 to test the performance of the simple debkiss model for egg development and yolk feeding we apply it to data for the atlantic cod once parameterised and tested this model may prove to be useful to interpret and predict the effects of environmental changes and stressor effects on the yolk feeding stages of cod as the debkiss model is generic it can then likely be applied to other fish species and even other egg laying animals as well 2 methods 2 1 basic model for embryos a detailed description of debkiss can be found elsewhere jager et al 2013 jager 2016 below a summary is given as far as relevant for the early life stages reproduction is excluded from the model description here the model structure for these stages is schematically shown in fig 1 and all symbols used in this study are summarised in table 1 note that in deb terminology the embryo is the initial stage of the life cycle where the animal does not feed exogeneously and the juvenile stage starts with the ability to feed exogeneously the points of hatching and metamorphosis the end of the larval stage are not stage switches from an energetic viewpoint over its early development the embryo goes through a series of events for cod described in detail by hall et al 2004 these events represent major changes in morphology of the embryo but for our debkiss model all this detail will be ignored the egg is treated as consisting of two state variables the mass of the egg buffer w b representing the yolk and the mass of structure w v representing the embryo or larvae without the yolk sac the egg buffer is assimilated at a rate j a and structural mass increases with a growth flux j v 1 d dt w b j a until w b 0 with w b 0 w b 0 2 d dt w v j v with w v 0 w v 0 to facilitate the links between mass surface area and body length it is practical to work with volumetric length l which is the cubic root of structural volume using the dry weight density d v volumetric length can in turn be linked to more practical length measures l w e g standard length sl in fish by a shape correction coefficient δ m 3 l 3 w v d v and l w l δ m reported water content for cod larvae 4 5 10 mm sl is around 85 finn et al 2002 this implies that we can use d v 0 15 mg mm3 as a reasonable estimate for the density of structure in our calibration data set finn et al 1995 yolk is expressed as a volume and hence we also need a dry weight density for the egg buffer d b we leave this as a free parameter to be estimated in the fit to the data as we have no direct information on the yolk properties measurements on total fresh eggs finn et al 1995 suggest a value close to 0 07 mg mm3 next we need to fill in the mass fluxes for the various processes the assimilation flux j a is proportional to a surface area of the animal and the maintenance flux j m to a volume a fraction κ of the assimilation flux is used with a certain efficiency y va for growth j v the remainder here denoted as j h is assumed to be dissipated in the deb context the flux j h is used for maturity and maturity maintenance even though these processes are not explicitly followed here specification of this flux is needed to close the mass balance and for the calculation of respiration rates later on the mass fluxes are defined as follows 4 j a f j am a l 2 if w b 0 then f 1 5 j m j m v l 3 6 j v y va κ j a j m 7 j h 1 κ j a the scaled functional response f is included in the assimilation flux j a and is a function of food availability 1 represents ad libitum conditions and 0 complete starvation for yolk feeding stages we assume f 1 until yolk runs out however what happens when the larva starts to feed exogeneously the larvae obtain the ability to feed after development of a functional jaw and hindgut hall et al 2004 which is generally before the yolk is fully exhausted kamler 2008 heming and buddington 1988 this implies that we at some point need to consider two food sources we leave the question of mixed feeding open at the moment as no food was offered to the animals in the experiments that we use the resulting instantaneous switch from f 1 to f 0 is unrealistic in detail in practice we will likely see a smoother transition from yolk feeding to starvation 2 2 response to starvation and temperature when the allocated assimilation flux κj a is insufficient to cover the maintenance costs j m the animal needs to deviate from the rules provided above jager et al 2013 proposed a simple model to deal with this problem in two stages see supporting information here we can simplify the model to a single stage as we assumed an instantaneous switch from f 1 to f 0 when yolk runs out in the absence of yolk or external food the animal will shrink i e use structural tissue to pay the maintenance cost 8 j v j m y av and j h 0 shrinking negative value for j v implies that w v will decrease but not necessarily l w if we use standard length as our size measure it will be determined by the length of the notochord which is unlikely capable of shrinking temperature is clearly an important factor for the bioenergetics and increasing the temperature speeds up development geffen et al 2006 in deb applications it is generally assumed that all rate constants with a dimension that includes per time scale in the same way with temperature we can use the arrhenius relationship to scale from a reference temperature t to the actual temperature t both in kelvin all rate constants have to be multiplied by 9 f t exp t a t t a t where t a is the arrhenius temperature in kelvin lika et al 2011 suggest a value of 8000 k as typical value 2 3 link between mass fluxes and oxygen use measurements of oxygen use provide valuable insights into the bioenergetics of the yolk feeding stages they are easier to interpret than measurements on the externally feeding stages the embryos continue all of the regular metabolic work during the measurement of oxygen use as they have a constant supply of energy in contrast feeding stages will usually be fasted for some time before measurement with unclear consequences for the bioenergetics see jager and ravagnan 2016 oxygen use is related to the mass fluxes that dissipate the total dissipation flux j d as relevant in the context of the early life stages is given by 10 j d j m j h j vo where j vo indicates the overhead costs for growth or shrinking 11 j vo j v 1 y va y va if j v 0 j v y av 1 if j v 0 the dissipation flux is a mass flux in mg of assimilates per day in practice respiration is often expressed in terms of oxygen use to convert this mass flux to moles of oxygen we need the carbon content of biomass or yolk for the species d c we take 0 4 mg mg 1 as a representative value the molar mass of carbon 12 g mol and the respiratory quotient f rq this quotient is the moles of co2 and thus also the moles of c eliminated per mole of o2 taken up we take 0 8 as a reasonable value for our validation study we need to convert moles of oxygen further to microliters which requires the molar mass of oxygen 32 g mol and its density 1 43 g l at 0 c 2 4 implementation and calibration the model was implemented in matlab using the generic byom platform http www debtox info byom html optimisation was performed by maximising an overall likelihood function assuming normally distributed and independent errors confidence intervals were calculated by profiling the likelihood all data were extracted from the original publications using the freeware plotreader http jornbr home xs4all nl plotreader the data are used in the form and with the units as given in the original publications the model outputs w b w v and j d were recalculated to match the type and unit of the data set this is done to keep the data points unaffected by the uncertainty in the transformations the only recalculation is the reconstruction of yolk dry weight in the data sets of solberg and tilseth 1984 1987 from the weights determined in those studies see sections 2 5 and 2 6 we selected the data set from finn et al 1995 to calibrate the model as it contains measurements on different endpoints from the same group of animals yolk volume dry weights standard length after hatch and respiration rate the experiments were perfomed at 6 c with the eggs initially kept under continuous light but switching to a 14 10 light dark regime post hatching the measured dry weight of the complete egg requires some further thought as this measurement includes contributions from the yolk the structural part of the embryo and the chorion of the egg for the chorion we take a fixed value of 0 020 mg based on the measurements of solberg and tilseth 1984 for the respiration data two series of measurements were presented one in light and one in dark conditions for the egg stage and several days after hatching these measurements were very similar but around the time that yolk ran out a profound difference was observed a square root transformation was applied for this data set to increase the importance of the initial respiration measurements of the early egg stages and decrease the importance of the post hatching measurements which is useful in view of the variation induced by light conditions 2 5 model testing to test the model and its parameterisation a second independent data set solberg and tilseth 1984 was used as model corroboration these authors report measurements of dry weights of chorion total egg whole larvae incl yolk larvae with dissected yolk as well as standard length post hatch these experiments were performed at 5 c under a 12 12 hour light regime and used two batches of eggs from different females since these experiments were done at a slightly different temperature 5 c instead of 6 c we calculated a temperature correction factor eq 9 which is applied to both rate constants specific assimilation and specific maintenance rates the initial amount of yolk w b0 was calculated from the mean weight of the total fresh egg in this study 0 107 mg minus the chorion and the value of w v0 table 1 additionally the same study reports some respiration data post hatching from other batches of eggs we added the respiration data from serigstad and adoff 1985 which covers the egg stage as well also performed at 5 c for all respiration data sets we do not have the corresponding development of larval and yolk mass for the same batches of eggs which implies additional uncertainty 2 6 effects of light and temperature solberg and tilseth 1984 1987 also report an experiment with hatched larvae reared under different temperatures 3 5 and 7 c and light conditions constant darkness or constant light total dry weight dry weight of larvae with dissected yolk and standard length were reported initial amounts of yolk and structure were fixed to the first measurements shortly after hatching these data only have information for the end of the yolk feeding stage and the subsequent starvation phase we fitted both the specific assimilation rate and the specific maintenance rate on each treatment κ was fixed to the value established in the calibration see table 1 and only show the parameter estimates fits are provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the model fit to the calibration data finn et al 1995 is shown in fig 2 the four data sets are fitted simultaneously with only seven parameters an average of less than two parameters per data set parameter estimates with confidence intervals are given in table 1 the model itself has only three parameters that need to be fitted additionally there are two initial states initial mass of structure and yolk that need to be estimated as well as two conversion factors to link state variables mass to observations yolk volume and standard length note that the estimate for the density of yolk is very close to the value estimated from the total fresh egg 0 07 mg mm3 finn et al 1995 overall the fit is very good but several issues can be observed on closer inspection starting with the total dry weight fig 2d the model predicts a decrease of total dry weight over the egg stage which is not shown in the data as the egg membrane severely restricts uptake of solutes the burning of yolk mass flux j d should lead to a loss of dry weight as the embryo develops closely linked to the observed respiration rate eggs may be taking up some minerals from water but no increase in ash content was observed in this study finn et al 1995 further eggs and larvae appear to be capable of absorbing dissolved organic molecules from water although the contribution to the mass and energy budget is expected to be negligible heming and buddington 1988 a decrease in total egg weight was observed in the validation data set solberg and tilseth 1984 so the lack of a decrease here could represent a measurement bias the respiration rate fig 2c is nicely fitted up to the point where the yolk runs out at that point there is also a clear difference between the respiration rate measured in light and in dark conditions the model predicts a sharp drop in respiration rate when yolk runs out as the scaled functional response switches instantly from f 1 to f 0 as a result of this transition to complete starvation growth switches to shrinking to match the maintenance needs which leads to a lower total dissipation flux as starvation progresses respiration decreases as also the total amount of structure to be maintained decreases this pattern is in general consistent with the data although there is a considerable difference between the respiration data in light and dark conditions the animals in the light clearly have a higher respiration rate after complete yolk absorption than predicted which can be linked to an increased swimming activity see solberg and tilseth 1984 the role of swimming activity in the energy budget is discussed further in section 3 3 the increase in standard length over time fig 2a is well matched by the model note that animals cannot shrink in length even though they do shrink in dry weight however growth seems to increase for slightly longer than predicted this might be caused by experimental difficulties of accurately measuring yolk volume close to the point of complete resorption it is also possible that some resources have already been irreversibly allocated to length increase notochord growth the estimate for κ is very high virtually all of the assimilated energy from yolk is used for maintenance and growth this value is linked to the fixed value for the growth efficiency y va and to the estimated specific maintenance rate j m v which in turn relies on the assumption that the shrinking of the larvae is linked to the maintenance requirements only given that the specific assimilation rate is severely restricted by the observed yolk absorption these three parameters κ y va and j m v determine the three fluxes contributing to dissipation see eq 10 and hence the efficiency with which yolk is turned into structural biomass for example assuming a higher growth efficiency y va 0 90 allows κ to decrease κ 0 93 with very little effect on the goodness of fit it will be difficult in practice to determine the value of the yield coefficients although this is unlikely to affect practical applications of the model the estimated value for the specific maintenance rate is very similar to the values established for two krill species jager and ravagnan 2016 when using the same reference temperature assuming an arrhenius temperature of 8000 k the specific assimilation rate is however lower which is surprising as cod will obviously grow to much larger sizes than krill maximum volumetric length is determined by κ j am a j m v the solution to this conundrum lies in the fact that fish accelerate metabolically after the start of feeding kooijman et al 2011 which involves an increase of the specific assimilation rate for some time after yolk has disappeared this allows these species to reach much larger sizes than indicated by their embryonic stage and also explains the deviation from von bertalanffy growth when early stages are included in the growth curve such an acceleration of growth relative to von bertalanffy growth was observed for larval cod by otterlei et al 1999 as a clear up curving for the length age relationship 3 2 model testing next the parameterised model is tested with data from solberg and tilseth 1984 the correspondence between model and data is quite convincing fig 3 especially given the fact that no parameters are fitted interestingly development in this study and for the additional respiration data from serigstad and adoff 1985 in panel c was somewhat slower than in the calibration study fig 2 hatching took place around day 18 compared to day 16 in the calibration study and complete yolk absorption after 24 days or even later compared to 21 days in the calibration furthermore the final stage of yolk resorption seems to be somewhat slower than predicted from the model fig 3b it appears that the transition from ad libitum yolk feeding to complete starvation is more gentle than assumed in the model also growth in length fig 3a continues for a while longer than predicted these deviations from the model predictions were not observed to the same extent in the calibration data set fig 2 it is tempting to include smoothing mechanisms such as the internal reserve compartment of the standard deb model sousa et al 2010 or a limitation of the assimilation flux by the surface area of the yolk sac see beer and anderson 1997 and supporting information however such mechanisms are inconsistent with the rather rapid transition in respiration rate when yolk disappears fig 2c and were also not as clear in other batches of eggs from solberg and tilseth 1984 see supporting information more detailed data on growth and respiration would be needed to settle this question the respiration data from different batches of eggs batch d h in fig 3c are not well matched by the model prediction before final yolk absorption the data are overestimated and afterwards

structural mass on the same group of animals we can now also use the model to predict embryonic development under other conditions for example we can predict how the duration of yolk feeding will change with egg size model simulation shows that yolk feeding will be extended by a factor of 1 4 longer for a doubling of the yolk content which is well in line with the factor of 1 3 mentioned by heming and buddington 1988 for cod and herring 3 3 effect of temperature and light the last data sets we used are also from solberg and tilseth 1984 1987 but consider only the changes in yolk weight

25227,despite years of attention the dynamics of species constrained to disperse within riverine systems are not well captured by existing population models here we develop a population model subject to local population dynamics and regional dispersal process in a closed linear riverine system which consists of three size different patches lakes arranged at different positions in the chain

mortality rate furthermore unbiased dispersal i e balanced down and upstream maximizes population viability in this closed linear system finally which type of spatial arrangement of size different

advection dominated systems goldberg et al 2010 applied matrix population models to a stage structured population in a dendritic network and found that a species modes of reproduction and dispersal jointly determine its response to changes in its life history parameters or in the spatial structure yet by integrating local population dynamics how spatial arrangement of size different patches impacts species persistence in riverine systems remains poorly understood in this study we model a simple linear riverine system consisting of three patches i e lakes with different size arranged at different positions in the chain two dispersal modes are considered one way only downstream dispersal and two way both up and downstream dispersal the local population dynamics are subject not only to the species dispersal between patches but also to the local demographic process local birth death dynamics with the model we determine how arrangement of size different patches species dispersal directions and local density regulation jointly influence metapopulation persistence 2 model description 2 1 riverine structures in a closed linear system similar to carrara et al 2014 and fronhofer and altermatt 2017 we use a general stochastic simulation model of individuals for a population living in different habitat patches with local resource competition this single population resides in a closed linear riverine system containing three patches i e lakes j 1 2 3 with a total carrying capacity k 3000 individuals we consider four riverine structures represented in fig 1 a the reference structure where the three patches have equal size each with a local carrying capacity k 1000 individuals b d patch size different structures with one large patch k 2000 individuals placed in the middle the upper end or the lower end of the linear riverine system respectively next to two smaller patches of equal size each having k 500 individuals 2 2 local population dynamics in this model given that local density regulation occurs within each patch lake because of local resource competition cf fronhofer and altermatt 2017 we use the logistic population growth model reported by beverton and holt 1957 for a given local patch j 1 n j t 1 g k n j t k g 1 n j t with g being the growth rate k the local carrying capacity and t the time step all individuals of the population have the same mortality probability e per unit time within a single time step each individual s death is determined by comparing its e with a randomly generated ri 0 1 the individual is assumed to die if ri e and survive otherwise 2 3 species dispersal to link local population dynamics to global population dynamics via individual dispersal fig 1 we consider two dispersal types in the linear riverine system one way i e only downstream movement and two way both down and upstream movement fagan 2002 lowe 2003 schick and lindley 2007 altermatt 2013 intrinsic downstream dispersal is defined to occur with a rate λ and intrinsic upstream dispersal with a rate λ under the ideal condition that water flow per unit time ϕi equals to lake water volume φi i e ϕi φi at the same time we have λ λ 1 as each individual can either move outside the patch upstream downstream or stay in place as such we have unbiased dispersal when the downstream dispersal rate equals to the upstream dispersal rate λ λ and biased dispersal if λ λ with downstream biased dispersal when λ λ and upstream biased dispersal if λ λ note that species dispersal rate also depends on both water flow per unit time ϕi and lake water volume φi i e proportional to patch carrying capacity ki for example if a patch has water volume φi and water flow per unit time ϕi 0 25φi then each individual in the local patch has actual dispersal rates λϕi φi 0 25λ downstream and λ ϕi φi 0 25λ upstream and a probability of the individual staying in place equal to 1 0 25 λ λ likewise we generate a random number ri 0 1 for each individual the target individual will move downstream if 0 ri 0 25λ move upstream when 0 25λ ri 0 25 λ λ or stay in the same patch otherwise 2 4 simulation approach in the closed linear riverine system local population dynamics are subject to the demographic process which is linked by species dispersal to shape global population dynamics as a result four processes determine species persistence local growth with a rate g intrinsic mortality with a rate e downstream dispersal with a rate λ and upstream dispersal with a rate λ with simulations cf carrara et al 2014 fronhofer and altermatt 2017 we first construct a linear system containing three size different patches i e lakes with patch size being proportional to individual carrying capacity within each patch we then simulate local population dynamics by including population growth mortality processes associated with local density regulation and the reproduction of local population follows the logistic population growth as described in eq 1 finally we link local population dynamics via individual dispersal e g individual upstream and or downstream movement between connected patches thereby yielding global population dynamics in this study we simulate population dynamics via matlab r2012a initially the three size different patches are assumed to be fully occupied then we run each case for a long time normally 10 000 time steps in order to achieve steady state and explore each case with 100 replicates ultimately the average of these 100 replicates yields the mean population density mean sd note that our results are qualitatively robust for a broad range of parameter combinations see figs s1 s4 in appendix in supplementary file using this model we determine how species dispersal strategies and patch arrangement impact population persistence in a linear riverine system 3 results we first test how species relative mortality rate e g affects population dynamics in the closed riverine system fig 2 simultaneously considering species dispersal mode one way or two way and riverine structure four types fig 1 generally increasing species relative mortality rate linearly decreases global population density at steady state for both unidirectional and bidirectional dispersal at the same time the global population density curves of the four riverine structures almost overlap reflecting the constant total carrying capacity in the system two way dispersal maintains a higher global density than one way dispersal fig 2i and ii but the difference gradually weakens with increasing species relative mortality rate as such species ultimately display the same extinction threshold at e g 0 25 where a species just goes extinct regardless of dispersal mode and the patch size structure of the closed linear riverine system next we examine the effects of combined upstream and downstream dispersal within the same species λ λ 1 on global population density in the same closed linear system again considering the four riverine structures with different patch arrangement figs 3 and 4 in general the interactive effects of up and down stream dispersal on global density in these four riverine structures are almost the same thereby yielding the similar population patterns fig 3 if the ratio between downstream and upstream dispersal rates λ λ is kept constant then the overall population density does not change with increasing their dispersal rates fig 3 furthermore unbiased dispersal i e both up and downs stream dispersal rates are equal λ λ yields the highest global density relative to biased dispersal i e λ λ with downstream biased dispersal if λ λ or upstream biased dispersal when λ λ while upstream or downstream biased dispersal can reduce overall population density regardless of patch arrangement fig 3 since extreme upstream or downstream biases would lower local population density for the downstream or upstream patches even driving local population extinction i e source ultimately such dispersal biases decrease global density because of the limited capacity and local density regulation in the upstream or downstream patches i e sink though local density in these patches may increase fig 3 with only one way dispersal i e λ 0 or λ 0 increasing dispersal rate reduces global density especially in the case with three size equal patches figs 4 s1 in appendix in supplementary file in such case which type of patch arrangement can maintain the highest population density is determined by both dispersal directionality and dispersal rate when a species exhibits two way dispersal λ 0 and λ 0 λ λ 1 population density first increases and then decreases with dispersal rate figs 4 s1 differences in global population density among the four riverine structures gradually disappear when the dispersal ratio λ λ approaches to 1 finally we investigate how species dispersal affects local population density in the four closed riverine systems in order to explain the underlying mechanisms of the global population patterns described above two extreme cases are considered only downstream fig 5 or only upstream dispersal fig s2 in appendix in supplementary file taking only downstream dispersal fig 5 for example the headwater upstream patch as population source for the downstream patch sink obviously maintains lower local density than the downstream patch in the four riverine structures with larger difference in population density at higher dispersal rate as such local populations would go extinct starting from upstream patches when comparing the four riverine structures we find that larger patch size promotes local density and thus species persistence in the upper level patch headwater most obviously at higher dispersal rate fig 5 but in the middle patch the highest local population density is observed at the smallest size fig 5c completely different from the case in the upper level patch similarly in the lower level patch the smallest size maintains the largest population density fig 5c while the lowest local density occurs at the largest size fig 5d a final observation in fig 5d is that local density at the bottom patch saturates when downstream dispersal rate is sufficiently high to cause local population extinction for the upstream patch 4 discussion most previous models addressing regional dispersal processes in riverine systems have treated all patches as no size nodes often obtaining a trivial outcome i e species extinction fagan 2002 grant et al 2007 2012 lynch et al 2011 mari et al 2014 bertuzzo et al 2015 different from previous models we develop a theoretical model for a closed linear riverine system with patch size differences like those often seen in real riverine systems for example linearly linked lakes of different sizes in addition species in a local patch follow logistic population growth by fixing local carrying capacity thus local population dynamics depend not only on species dispersal between connected patches but also on local growth mortality processes with the model we find that different patch arrangements resulting in distinct global population density is greatly regulated by species dispersal including both dispersal directionality and rate revealing the importance of the interplay between patch size difference and species dispersal traits for species persistence hiebeler 2000 urban and keitt 2001 fagan 2002 altermatt 2013 liao et al 2013a b carrara et al 2014 this is different from the view proposed by grant 2011 that species persistence in riverine systems is determined only by stochastic dispersal extinction dynamics which follows from ignoring patch size as expected two way dispersal maintains higher global population density than one way dispersal e g only downstream dispersal although such dispersal superiority can be weakened by increasing species relative mortality rate fig 2 taking one way downstream dispersal as an example populations in upstream patches suffer higher extinction risk than in downstream patches as downstream patches sink get net population immigration from upstream patches source however if species can move both upstream and downstream then a high rate of upstream dispersal can swamp negative effects of downstream dispersal on populations in upper level patches allowing the species to persist there as a result two way dispersal outweighs one way dispersal as an optimal strategy for species persistence in our closed linear system we further find that unbiased dispersal λ λ maximizes global density for two way dispersers suggesting that either upstream or downstream biased dispersal should increase population extinction risk figs 3 and 4 actually this is a result of the balance between upstream and downstream dispersal among connected patches for example excessive downstream biased or upstream biased dispersal that drains away dispersers to downstream or upstream patches would lead to local population extinction in upper level or lower level patches as the associated weak upstream or downstream dispersal is insufficient to compensate local population loss there as such these upstream or downstream dispersing individuals are wasted further resulting in a decline in global population density such mechanism can also explain the observed local population pattern when species only display one way downstream or upstream dispersal figs 5 s2 in appendix in supplementary file taking only downstream dispersal as an example the bottom patch as a sink can maintain the highest local density by receiving net population inflow while the upstream patch as a source suffers net population loss when we consider both downstream and upstream dispersal simultaneously see figs s3 s4 in appendix in supplementary file which patch owns a highest local density largely depends on the ratio between down and up stream dispersal rates λ λ the three patches can keep the same local density regardless of patch size difference if λ λ 1 while the highest local density occurs in the upstream or downstream patch at λ λ 1 or λ λ 1 figs s3 s4 as a result local population patterns are greatly determined by species dispersal traits including the rate direction and ratio of down and up stream dispersal comparing the four linear riverine structures we find that the smallest patch at the bottom owns the highest local density under only downstream dispersal because of i high population inflow from upstream patches and ii lowest local carrying capacity moreover local populations at the bottom patch would first increase and then decrease with increasing downstream dispersal rate as excessive downstream dispersing populations are wasted due to the limited local carrying capacity as such intermediate downstream dispersal rate maximizes local density for the bottom patch it is worth noting that the upstream patch arrangement can alter the maximal local density at the bottom with a largest patch far from the bottom leading to highest local population density fig 5b c this should be due to the fact that a larger upstream patch source can maintain higher local density ensuring a continuous population supply for the downstream patch sink similar mechanism can also explain the different patterns of global density for the four riverine structures e g fig 4i therefore which type of patch arrangement can maintain the highest global population density is not only subject to inter patch dispersal directionality and rate but also to local patch dynamics including local carrying capacity and growth mortality dynamics reflecting the balance between local demographic and regional dispersal processes the modelling framework presented omits some features known to occur in many riverine

25228,mungbean vigna radiate l wilczek is an important pulse crop for south asian region its productivity is low and usually grown under water limited environments generally irrigation at around flowering stage is provided if soil moisture is limiting its growth and yield is highly sensitive to fluctuations in climatic conditions especially water logging at any growth stage present study aimed at developing simple mungbean growth munggro model following the principles of sucros2 and the programme is written in fortran simulation translator fst water balance sub routine has been undertaken along with g e interaction and the model was successfully calibrated and validated for growing environments of bangladesh subsequently the model was utilized to evaluate the interaction effects of increased temperatures and carbon dioxide co2 levels yield in general decreased with the rise in temperature primarily due to reduction in growth duration and seed weight growth rate of the crop increased co2 levels compensated to some extent the deleterious effects of increased temperatures water logging especially at the beginning of the crop growth stage had pronounced effect in reducing the grain yield drastically that was also reflected from the model at present we have calculated nitrogen n uptake and n fixation at the terminal stage of the crop the model further needs to be improved by including n balance and insect pest sub routines keywords mungbean fst temperature co2 water logging 1 introduction mungbean is important pulse crop in bangladesh and grows in many places under clear sunshine and low humidity conditions cloudy weather incessant or heavy rainfall induces water logging and cause insect pests and diseases problems such events might results in total crop failure or severe yield reduction as temperature and carbon dioxide levels are likely to be increased in bangladesh by 2050 and beyond biswas et al 2017 gain yield of mungbean will be reduced greatly legumes as a green manure provides n in rice based cropping systems watanabe and liu 1992 which could be about 50 70 kg n ha for the succeeding crops meelu and rekhi 1981 in general higher grain yields are obtained from the succeeding crops after legumes singh et al 1982 this increase in yield is attributed mainly to the increased n availability through n fixation and addition of crop residues to soil as continuous cultivation of rice or wheat declined organic matter and n content in soils timsina et al 2006 mungbean could be considered to enrich soils with nutrients bhuiyan 2004 mungbean can be sown from 21 january to 30 march depending on location of the country and cropping patterns islam et al 2016 its growing as a summer crop can gave higher grain yields when sown on mid february to first week of march sarker et al 2004 miah et al 2009 this crop is generally grown after t aman mustard wheat and potato in general mungbean growing areas are barisal bogra chuadanga

moisture for germination or post sowing irrigation for stand establishment conventional studies have showed responses of mungbean to elevated co2 levels uprety et al 1996 haque et al 2005 dey et al 2017 and water logging ullah 2006 but no reports on higher temperature effects in this part of the world to study combined effects of increased temperature co2 levels along with water stress on mungbean growth and development for different regions of bangladesh is not only time consuming but also very costly modeling can play an important role under such situations although no suitable model for mungbean is available however van keulen et al 1992 developed crop growth model for water limited production environment our objectives were to develop a model munggro for studying effects of elevated temperature co2 levels and water stress on mungbean yield in bangladesh and other south asian countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 development of mungbean munggro model mungbean is an important crop of south asia and widely grown in bangladesh as fit in crop in the major cropping systems at present no model dealing with this important pulse crop so efforts were made to collate various plant processes behaviour from published literature haque et al 2005 ullah 2006 hayat et al 2008 bari 2011 2117 in this region and transfer functions were developed to subsequently use in this model the programme is written in fst fortran simulation translator rappoldt and van kraalingen 1996 and the compiler used fst win 4 12 it requires weather data daily basis in specific format for running of the model several global models viz wofost oryza wtgrows and inforcrop have been developed with fst compiler and successfully used for yield estimates natural resource management options and climate change studies this compiler is easy to handle as it has specific in built functions to conveniently write the programme the munggro model was used to simulate yield with 0 1 2 and 3 c rise in temperature under 380 450 550 and 650 ppm co2 levels having normal moisture and water logged conditions the model was used to see the effects of temperature rise by 1 2 3 and 4 c on total

grain yield of mungbean reduced greatly because of increase in temperature under same level of co2 level fig 6 grain yield reduction because of 1 c rise temperature is likely to be compensated if co2 level rise up to 650 ppm haque et al 2005 and dey et al 2017 also reported higher grain yields of mungbean with elevated co2 levels however increased co2 levels are unlikely to compensate yield reduction beyond 1 c rise although there is somewhat yield increase with increased co2 levels water logging for two days at 65 and 66 days after sowing severely reduces grain yield of mungbean ullah 2006 reported 12 74 yield reduction depending on duration of water logging 3 5 crop growth rate at 380 ppm co2 level growth duration reduced by 2 2 days grain filling duration by 1 2 days and seed weight growth rate by 4 98 kg ha day because of each degree rise in temperature fig 7 haque et al 2005 and dey et al 2017 also reported that higher levels of co2 reduced pod maturity and increased grain yield they also reported increased pod numbers and seed size with elevated co2 levels water logging drastically reduced 1000 grain weight dry matter production and plant height as reported by ullah 2006 4 conclusion mungbean is an important legume crop in bangladesh it is a short duration crop that fit into the major rice based cropping systems and thus provide benefits in terms of soil health and farmer s income growth and yield of this crop is highly sensitive to water logging in the present study a mungbean growth model munggro was developed following sucros2 model and was written in fortran simulation translator the g e interaction coupled with water stress effects was included in this model and n uptake and n fixation were simulated at the terminal stage the model was successfully calibrated and validated for growing environments of bangladesh subsequently the model was tested for temperature and co2 interactions grain yield of mungbean decreased with increasing temperatures which was partially remunerated by increased co2 levels the developed munggro model can be used for studying the climate change impact and natural resource management strategies in south asian growing regions for this important crop acknowledgements we greatly acknowledge financial support of krishi gobeshona foundation bangladesh through the project on modelling climate change impact

25228,mungbean vigna radiate l wilczek is an important pulse crop for south asian region its productivity is low and usually grown under water limited environments generally irrigation at around flowering stage is provided if soil moisture is limiting its growth and yield is highly sensitive to fluctuations in climatic conditions especially water logging at any growth stage present study aimed at developing simple mungbean growth munggro model following the principles of sucros2 and the programme is written in fortran simulation translator fst water balance sub routine has been undertaken along with g e interaction and the model was successfully calibrated and validated for growing environments of bangladesh subsequently the model was utilized to evaluate the interaction effects of increased temperatures and carbon dioxide co2 levels yield in general decreased with the rise in temperature primarily due to reduction in growth duration and seed weight growth rate of the crop increased co2 levels compensated to some extent the deleterious effects of increased temperatures water logging especially at the beginning of the crop growth stage had pronounced effect in reducing the grain yield drastically that was also reflected from the model at present we have calculated nitrogen n uptake and n fixation at the terminal stage of the crop the model further needs to be improved by including n balance and insect pest sub routines keywords mungbean fst temperature co2 water logging 1 introduction mungbean is important pulse crop in bangladesh and grows in many places under clear sunshine and low humidity conditions cloudy weather incessant or heavy rainfall induces water logging and cause insect pests and diseases problems such events might results in total crop failure or severe yield reduction as temperature and carbon dioxide levels are likely to be increased in bangladesh by 2050 and beyond biswas et al 2017 gain yield of mungbean will be reduced greatly legumes as a green manure provides n in rice based cropping systems watanabe and liu 1992 which could be about 50 70 kg n ha for the succeeding crops meelu and rekhi 1981 in general higher grain yields are obtained from the succeeding crops after legumes singh et al 1982 this increase in yield is attributed mainly to the increased n availability through n fixation and addition of crop residues to soil as continuous cultivation of rice or wheat declined organic matter and n content in soils timsina et al 2006 mungbean could be considered to enrich soils with nutrients bhuiyan 2004 mungbean can be sown from 21 january to 30 march depending on location of the country and cropping patterns islam et al 2016 its growing as a summer crop can gave higher grain yields when sown on mid

2017 and water logging ullah 2006 but no reports on higher temperature effects in this part of the world to study combined effects of increased temperature co2 levels along with water stress on mungbean growth and development for different regions of bangladesh is not only time consuming but also very costly modeling can play an important role under such situations although no suitable model for mungbean is available however van keulen et al 1992 developed crop growth model for water limited production environment our objectives were to develop a model munggro for studying effects of elevated temperature co2 levels and water stress on mungbean yield in bangladesh and other south asian countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 development of mungbean munggro model mungbean is an important crop of south asia and widely grown in bangladesh as fit in crop in the major cropping systems at present no model dealing with this important pulse crop so efforts were made to collate various plant processes behaviour from published literature haque et al 2005 ullah 2006 hayat et al 2008 bari 2011 2117 in this region and transfer functions were developed to subsequently use in this model the programme is written in fst fortran simulation translator rappoldt and van kraalingen 1996 and the compiler used fst win 4 12 it requires weather data daily basis in specific format for running of the model several global models viz wofost oryza wtgrows and inforcrop have been developed with fst compiler and successfully used for yield estimates natural resource management options and climate change studies this compiler is easy to handle as it has specific in built functions to conveniently write the programme the munggro model was used to simulate yield with 0 1 2 and 3 c rise in temperature under 380 450 550 and 650 ppm co2 levels having normal moisture and water logged conditions the model was used to see the effects of temperature rise by 1 2 3 and 4 c on total

was 2001 with date of sowing as 83 julian day and recommended practices were used fig 3 shows the calibration of munggro results in terms of seed yield the dataset points were field experiments at multi location trials of pulse research center bari bangladesh bari 2011 2017 the simulated results showed overestimation of the model results at lower yield situation whereas reverse in trend was noticed for higher yield situation but the performance was satisfactory through higher value of degree of predictability moreover the crop is sensitive to various biotic and abiotic stress conditions which might not have been possibly included in the running of the model however the experiments which were under non limiting condition of abiotic stresses other than water for test cultivar bari mung 6 fig 4 shows the performance of the model in terms of total dry matter production simulated values were in close agreement with the observed values in the beginning but the observed values were relatively higher in the later stages of the crop growth the percent deviation of the simulated values from the observed points ranged from 4 7 to 16 9 the seed yield till harvest was 1298 kg ha whereas the simulated value was 1384 kg ha which was 6 6 higher than the observed value the performance of the model was quite satisfactory 3 3 validation of mungbean munggro model on the basis of annual reports of pulse research center bari bangladesh mung 6 was used as test crop for model run and the simulated values were compared with the observed values bari 2011 2017 the yield had large range of variations as the experiments were compiled over years indicating the inter annual climatic variability has significant effect of mungbean seed yield trend line was almost in close agreement with the 1 1 line and also the slope of the trend was 1 06 i e near to one indicating the perfectness of the model for seed yield estimate fig 5 3 4 grain yield under normal soil moisture condition grain yield of mungbean reduced greatly because of increase in temperature under same level of co2 level fig 6 grain yield reduction because of 1 c rise temperature is likely to be compensated if co2 level rise up to 650 ppm haque et al 2005 and dey et al 2017 also reported higher grain yields of mungbean with elevated co2 levels however increased co2 levels are unlikely to compensate yield reduction beyond 1 c rise although there is somewhat yield increase with increased co2 levels water logging for two days at 65 and 66 days after sowing severely reduces grain yield of mungbean ullah 2006 reported 12 74 yield reduction depending on duration of water logging 3 5 crop growth rate at 380 ppm co2 level growth duration reduced by 2 2 days grain filling duration by 1 2 days and seed weight growth rate by 4 98 kg ha day because of each degree rise in temperature fig 7 haque et al 2005 and dey et al 2017 also reported that higher levels of co2 reduced pod maturity and increased grain yield they also reported increased pod numbers and seed size with elevated co2 levels water logging drastically reduced 1000 grain weight dry matter production and plant height as reported by ullah 2006 4 conclusion mungbean is an important legume crop in bangladesh it is a short duration crop that fit into the major rice based cropping systems and thus provide benefits in terms of soil health and farmer s income growth and yield of this crop is highly sensitive to water logging in the present study a mungbean growth model munggro was developed following sucros2 model and was written in fortran simulation translator the g e interaction coupled with water stress effects was included in this model and n uptake and n fixation were simulated at the terminal stage the model was successfully calibrated and validated for growing environments of bangladesh subsequently the model was tested for temperature and co2 interactions grain yield of mungbean decreased with increasing temperatures which was partially remunerated by increased co2 levels the developed munggro model can be used for studying the climate change impact and natural resource management strategies in south

25229,incorporating limited ecological curves a novel operation chart optimization method is proposed for the multipurpose hydropower systems which is capable of improving power generation and overall ecological condition and alleviating ecological degradation under extreme dry or wet conditions the method mainly includes 1 determine the optimal ecological discharge using weighted usable area discharge curve based on the physical habitat simulation model phabsim and 2 establish the operation chart optimization model aiming to maximizing power generation and overall ecological condition and solve the model with dpsa then 3 derive the limited ecological curves and incorporate them in the operation chart a case study is performed with jasajiang js and madushan mds reservoirs on the yuan river in southwestern china the results show that the optimized operation charts result in a 1 72 and 5 99 increase in hydropower generation and a 0 27 and 1 13 increase in ecological conservation degree for mds reservoir respectively in addition the frequency of ecological damage is reduced from 6 11 to 1 11 for js reservoir and from 26 67 to 3 89 for js and mds reservoirs respectively a further discussion using a time series of random runoff generated by first order markov model has confirmed the adaptability of this operation chart the feasibility and potential applications of this operation chart has been confirmed keywords optimized operation chart limited ecological curve ecological conservation degree cascade hydropower stations 1 introduction in recent years there have been increasing concerns over the ecological impacts of the extensive construction of cascade hydropower stations despite their high aquatic productivity and great hydropower potential wang 2017 the construction of cascade reservoirs can dramatically alter the flow regime of rivers suen and eheart 2006 and thus ecological requirements should be incorporated into the operation chart of hydropower stations to balance ecological protection and other important functions operation chart is a practical and widely used reservoir scheduling rule it is usually derived by the reverse calculation method cheng et al 2010 specifically a few typical hydrological years are selected based on historical runoff data the water balance formula is used for the reverse calculation of the water level from the end of the dry season to the beginning of impounding as shown in fig 1 the upper and lower envelopes of all indicator water levels lines are derived as the basic guiding curves upper basic guiding curve and lower basic guiding curve on the basis of that increased and decreased output curve could be derived by increasing or decreasing the basic guiding curve at a certain ratio nevertheless a potential problem is that the calculation is cumbersome and needs to be modified manually xie et al 2015 considerable attempts have been made to optimize reverse operation charts as shown in table 1 however it is noted that most previous studies on operation chart optimization have focused on water supply power generation and flood control with less attention to potential ecological impacts table 1 summarizes recent advancement in ecological operation and operation chart optimization of reservoirs in particular zhou and guo 2013 attempted to incorporate ecological requirements into the operating rule curves of multipurpose reservoirs for adaptation to climate changes the objective of which was to maximize the ecological benefits however although this makes it possible to maximize overall ecological benefits ecological deterioration cannot be totally avoided under hydrological extreme conditions in addition some ecological operation models just used the minimum ecological flow or ecological guarantee rate as the constraint guo et al 2018 wen et al 2018 which can effectively avoid dramatic ecological failure under hydrological extreme conditions however there is no technique to maximize the overall ecological condition of the basin that is it cannot effectively improve the overall ecological benefits given the complexity of operation chart optimization the ecological discharge is usually taken as a constant estimated by the tennant method or other simple methods tharme 2003 however the demand of fish species for ecological discharge can vary dynamically depending on their growth cycles there have been extensive studies on the ecological discharge regimes which can be categorized into four groups namely hydrological hydraulics habitat simulation and holistic methodologies hydrological methods and hydraulics methods mainly focus on hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of rivers while neglecting aquatic organisms demands for habitats in comparison the habitat simulation and holistic methods are proposed based on field investigation and experiments which reflects the more realistic preferences of aquatic species in particular the habitat simulation method is more suitable for micro habitat simulation while the integrated method is more appropriate for macro habitat simulation spence and hickley 2000 the physical habitat simulation model phabsim bovee and milhous 1978 is one of the classical models proposed in the early 1970 s which can simulate habitat area for aquatic creatures it is also widely used in ecological flow determination booker and dunbar 2004 johnson et al 2017 since it can provide insights into how the hydraulic habitat of fish species changes in response to the alteration of flow regime and thus determine the optimal ecological streamflow based on habitat flow curves for example gibbins et al 2001 determined the ecologically acceptable river flow regimes of kielder reservoir and water transfer system using phabsim wen et al 2016 quantified the ecological demand using phabsim which was then incorporated into the cascade reservoir operating schemes based on the quantification of ecological requirements by wen et al 2016 we derived the limited ecological curves and incorporated them into optimal operation charts for multipurpose hydropower systems which was capable of improving power generation and ecological conservation and alleviating ecological degradation as much as possible under hydrological extreme conditions a case study was then performed with the jiasajiang js and madushan mds cascade hydropower stations in the yuan river basin in southwestern china and cyprinus rubrofuscus lacépède and b rutilus were selected as the representative fish of the downstream reach of js reservoir and mds reservoir respectively phabsim was initially used to simulate the relationship between the stream flow and physical habitat of fish species and determine the optimal ecological discharge range for a given river reach the operation chart optimization model with the goal of maximizing power generation and ecological conservation was established and resolved by dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa algorithm then the limited ecological curve a new guiding curve which reflects basic ecological demand in practical operation was derived and incorporated into the operation chart 2 research area and data the yuan river is located in southwestern china with a total length of 692 km and a drainage area of 34 629 km2 two main tributaries lishe river and lvzhi river join at the sanjiangkou to form the yuan river fig 2 and then it flows through the southwestern china and vietnam before emptying into the sea the yuan river basin has high aquatic productivity and hydropower potential however the utilization of water resources is restricted to the main reach of the river while most branches and the upper reach of the river are essentially unexplored the jiasajiang js and madushan mds cascade hydropower stations are the largest hydropower stations on the yuan river whose main functions are power generation and ecological protection js an annual regulated reservoir locates at the upstream of mds reservoir it is equipped with three hydropower units the maximum output and discharge capacity of each unit are 90 mw and 90 m³ s respectively mds is a seasonal regulated reservoir located at downstream reach of js with smaller storage capacity it also has three hydropower units the maximum output and discharge capacity of each unit is 96 mw and 163m³ s respectively the basic parameters of these two reservoirs are shown in table 2 the monthly average runoff data were collected at the dam site of js and mds reservoirs from january 1981 to december 2010 in most times in a year water is released passing through the hydropower units if huge flood hits the basin the spillway would be used to increase the releasing in this case the releasing water would pass through both hydropower units and spillways 3 methodology 3 1 physical habitat simulation model phabsim bovee and milhous 1978 is proposed to simulate the relationship between the streamflow and the physical habitat for various life stages of fish species and then to determine the optimal ecological discharge for a given river reach it is considered as one of the earlier models to simulate the area of habitat for creatures and widely used in ecological flow calculation currently in the world booker and dunbar 2004 johnson et al 2017 phabsim consists of hydraulic simulation and habitat modeling waddle 2001 the mansq model manning s equation is used in the hydraulic simulation to determine the depth and velocity of the stream while the habitat suitability index hsi bovee 1986 which can reflect the preference of target fish species with regards to flow velocity depth and channel properties is used in the habitat modelling to obtain the weighted usable areas wua petts and maddock 1994 for each fish species and its life stages and the wua discharge curve can be obtained through phabsim the best ecological flow rate could be estimated via flow versus wua relations corresponding to the vertex point with the largest wua value however the ideal situation that releases the exact best ecological flow can hardly be achieved in practical operation of cascaded reservoirs here the optimal ecological requirements are expressed as the discharge range associated with the upper area of a certain proportion of maximum wua projected by wua discharge relationship to provide more flexibility to balance hydropower and ecological conservation objectives this certain proportion is defined as the ecological conservation degree r and it could also be calculated as the ratio of wua value of any timestep t to the maximum wua value as shown in eq 1 as an example a schematic of this procedure with 70 is shown in fig 3 1 r t w u a t w u a t max 100 where w u a t is the weighted usable areas of any timestep t w u a t max is the largest weighted usable area value projected by wua discharge curve if the runoff is in the optimal ecological flow range q1 q2 in following fig 3 or the conservation degree is larger than the selected conservation degree objective 70 as an example here then we consider the ecological condition is conserved in this situation if not then the ecological condition is damaged 3 2 operation chart optimization of cascade reservoirs 3 2 1 framework the objective of the conventional reservoir operation chart is to maximize the power generation without considering the ecological impacts on the river basin thereby often resulting in degradation of river ecosystems in order to address these problems we propose a new approach to determine the optimal operation chart for multipurpose hydropower systems which is capable of improving power generation and ecological conservation and alleviating ecological damage as much as possible under hydrological extreme conditions this approach consists of the following steps 1 optimize the original guiding curve of the conventional operation chart with the goal of maximizing power generation and ecological conservation as a result the optimization model is established and used to solve the optimal reservoir operation chart which can improve the power generation of multipurpose hydropower systems and the average ecological conservation degree and 2 a limited ecological curve is incorporated to address the ecological impacts under hydrological extreme conditions and improve the ecological conservation in the downstream areas this is because in extremely wet or dry years ecological damage can occur sometimes even with the use of the optimal operation chart obtained in step 1 the ecological discharge range can be determined from the wua discharge curve the upper limited ecological curve is derived using the upper boundary of the ecological discharge range and the area above the upper limited ecological curve is the upper limited ecological zone zoneⅴ similarly the area below the lower limited ecological curve is the lower limited ecological zone zoneⅰ as shown in fig 4 the operation chart is proposed based on the time series of historical monthly average streamflow so it generates a monthly based decision rule here namely the monthly average output or the monthly average release when the reservoir water level falls in the upper lower limited ecological zone then the release should equal to the upper or lower boundary of the ecological discharge range respectively in addition the limited ecological zone has the priority over other guiding curves when the limited ecological zone overlaps with other zones in the operation chart the reservoir releasing should follow the operation rules in limited ecological zone in addition when the reservoir water level falls in the reduced output zone zoneⅱ or increased output zone zoneⅳ then the hydropower plant should correspondingly reduce or increase the output in the guaranteed output zone zoneⅲ the planet should be running maintaining the firm capacity 3 2 2 ecology hydropower generation operation chart optimization model 3 2 2 1 objective functions hydropower generation and ecological conservation are the main objectives of js and mds reservoirs thus the following two objective functions are considered in the proposed optimization model 1 maximizing ecological conservation degree 2 e 1 max 1 n t i 1 n t 1 t r i t where e 1 is the average ecological conservation degree for reservoir n n 1 n and time period t t 1 t and ri t is the ecological conservation degree corresponding to the discharge of hydropower station i during the period t 2 maximizing the total power generation 3 e 2 max i 1 n t 1 t k i q i t h i t δ t where e 2 is the total power generation mw h n and t have the same meaning as the previous equation q i t is the turbine release of hydropower station i during the period t m³ s k i is the output efficiency of hydropower station i h i t is the average water head of hydropower station i during the period t m and δ t is the time step s a multi objective problem can be converted into a single objective one using weights that measure the importance of each objective eum et al 2012 in this study the multi objective function is converted into the following single objective one 4 max e max i 1 2 α i e i i 1 2 α i 1 e i e i e i where e is the total objective α i is the weight and it reflects the preference of decision makers for power generation and ecological benefit e i is the average of sub objective function e i and e i is the normalized sub objective function 3 2 2 2 constraints the following constraints are considered in this study 1 the shape of the guiding curves which do not cross 5 z i t min d i t j 1 d i t j d i t j 1 z i t max i 1 2 n t 1 2 t j 1 2 k where k is the number of guiding curves d i t j is the water level at the j th guiding curve of the operation chart i during the period t d i t j 1 and d i t j 1 are the points above and below the current guiding curve in the same period and z i t min and z i t max are the minimum and maximum water level limits of reservoir i during the period t m³ respectively the target of this constraint is guiding curves in conventional operation chart if the guiding curves cross reasonable operation zones cannot be formed 2 water balance constraints 6 v i t 1 v i t i i t q i t δ t i 1 2 n t 1 2 t where v i t is the storage of reservoir i during the period t m³ i i t is the inflow of reservoir i during the period t m³ s and q i t is the outflow of reservoir i during the period t m³ s 3 reservoir storage limits 7 v i t min v i t v i t max i 1 2 n t 1 2 t where v i t min and v i t max are the minimum and maximum storage limits of reservoir i during the period t m³ respectively 4 output constraints 8 n i min n i t n i max i 1 2 n t 1 2 t where n i t is the power output of hydropower station i during the period t w and n i min and n i max are the minimum and maximum power output of hydropower station i w respectively 5 outflow constraints 9 q i t min q i t q i t max i 1 2 n t 1 2 t where q i t min and q i t max are the minimum and maximum outflow a total discharge considering both power generation and spill of reservoir i during the period t m³ s respectively 3 2 3 optimization algorithm the reservoir operation chart optimization is a multi dimensional and multi stage optimization problem there are many commonly used optimization algorithms such as dynamic programing and some evolutionary algorithms ea such as genetic algorithm ga and differential evolution algorithm de dp is not an appropriate approach for such a multi dimensional and multi stage problem because of curse of dimensionality nandalal and bogardi 2007 most of the evolutionary algorithms eas have been successfully applied in reservoir operation strategies optimization hossain and el shafie 2013 however operation chart optimization is different since the guiding curves have divided the reservoir storage into several zones in the operation chart it is possible that the optimization technique could propose the same releasing policy in different guiding curve combinations which would affect the crossover and variation process of the eas resulting in the unstable optimization performance dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa is effective in solving multidimensional problems larson and korsak 1970 it decomposes the multidimensional problem into a sequence of one dimensional problems by optimizing over one state variable at a time which can be used for the development of optimal storage guide curves opan 2010 shim et al 2002 and zhang et al 2015 used dpsa for reducing the spatial dimensionality of the multiple reservoirs to optimize the operation of multi reservoir systems furthermore global optimization techniques generate initial operation chart in the modelling optimization randomly while the dpsa algorithm requires to input the initial solution manually usually conventional operation chart is employed to alleviate the randomness and uncertainty of randomly generated initial status thus dpsa was used to resolve the operation chart optimization model as shown in fig 5 the conventional operation chart is taken as the initial operation chart and the optimization process are summarized as follows step 1 within the permitted scope discrete the current point and the values of other points on the operation chart are fixed step 2 to the different discrete points implement simulation calculation respectively then update the current point with the point that can maximize the objective step 3 in the same way perform the steps 1 and 2 to the other points on the operation chart end up with a new operation chart step 4 calculate the difference between the new operation chart and the initial one using eq 10 10 d c 1 c 2 s 1 s k 1 k c 1 s k c 2 s k where c 1 s k and c 2 s k are the water level of guiding curve s in operation charts c1and c2 during the period k respectively step 5 if the difference meets the accuracy criteria then stop counting otherwise take the operation chart as a new initial operation chart and then proceed to the next round of optimization 3 2 4 the limited ecological curves the limited ecological curves can be used to mitigate ecological damage under extremely dry or wet conditions which consists of the upper and the lower limited ecological curves however it is important to note that these limited ecological curves are not hard constraints which can cause the problem of no solution under extremely dry or wet conditions it is a very flexible regulation technique which can reduce the frequency and extent of ecological damage under extremely dry or wet conditions and it can also make adaptive adjustments in case of conflict with other important objectives the limited ecological curve can be derived as follows 1 lower limited ecological curve the dry years are selected and the water balance formula is used for the reverse calculation of the water level from the end of the dry season to the beginning of the wet season according to the inflow rate and the lower boundary of the ecological discharge range the upper envelope curve of the water level in each dry year is the lower limited ecological curve and 2 upper limited ecological curve the wet years are selected and the water balance formula is also used for the reverse calculation of the water level from the end of impounding to the beginning of impounding according to the inflow rate and the upper boundary of the ecological discharge range the lower envelope curve of the reservoir water level in each wet year is the upper limited ecological curve 4 results and discussion 4 1 determination of ecological discharge cyprinus rubrofuscus lacépède and bagarius rutilus ng et kottelat refered to as b rutilus hereafter are chosen as the target fish species of the yuan river due to their genetic diversity and great economic values the natural resource conservation region of cyprinus rubrofuscus lacépède is located at the downstream of the js reservoir however the habitat and population of b rutilus have decreased significantly in recent years and now most of them live in the downstream areas of the mds reservoir wen et al 2016 obtained the relationship between wua and the flow rate for different lifestages of cyprinus rubrofuscus lacépède and b rutilus in the yuan river based on the phabsim model the optimal ecological discharge range for the two fish species at an ecological conservation degree of 70 are shown in table 3 4 2 optimization of multipurpose reservoir operation chart the optimized operation charts are derived based on the monthly average runoff data from january 1981 to december 2010 the ecological conservation degrees and weights in the objective function should be adjusted dynamically during the operation according to both current and desired conditions for example α 1 0 5 and α 2 0 5 are used in the objective function and the ecological conservation degree is set to 70 as for the parameter estimation of dpsa the distance accuracy is 0 5 and 2 for the guiding curves and the operation charts respectively in this study the performance of three operation charts including conventional operation chart optimized conventional operation chart and optimized ecological operation chart are compared as summarized in table 4 the conventional operation chart acts as the baseline condition which refers to the current guiding curves without optimization the optimized conventional operation chart is obtained by multi objective optimization of the conventional operation chart without consideration of ecological curves while optimized ecological operation chart is obtained by further addition of the limited ecological curves fig 6 shows the operation charts of the js and mds reservoirs these operation zones refer to the relationship between water level and operation strategy there are seven zones in the optimized ecological operation chart of the js reservoir including the lower limited ecological zone the zone between the dead water level and the lower limited ecological curve reduced output zone guaranteed output zone 1 5 times increased output zone 2 times increased output zone full capacity output zone and upper limited ecological zone the zone between the normal water level and the upper limited ecological curve from the bottom to the top compared with conventional operation chart the limited ecological zones are incorporated into the optimized ecological operation chart in the wet season june november the upper basic guiding curve of the optimized ecological operation chart moves down and the increased output zone is enlarged to increase output and reduce surplus water the lower basic guiding curve moves up in the midterm wet season august september and the output would be reduced in case of less inflow to increase water storage for power generation in the dry season there are five zones in the optimized ecological operation chart of the seasonal regulated mds reservoir including the lower limited ecological zone reduced output zone guaranteed output zone increased output zone and upper limited ecological zone from the bottom to the top compared with the conventional operation chart the increased output zone in the optimized ecological operation chart is enlarged in the late wet season october november to increase output and reduce surplus water because the reservoir has a large inflow but a small storage capacity during this period 4 3 optimization performance of js mds cascade reservoirs using the time series of monthly inflow from 1981 to 2010 the operation of js and mds reservoirs were simulated using the conventional operation chart optimized conventional operation chart and optimized conventional operation chart as shown in fig 6 generating the corresponding releasing policy in terms of monthly outflow respectively and the results are shown in table 5 the situation in which the ecological conservation degree is lower than the target 70 defined in this study is referred to as ecological damage for the js reservoir the annual average power generation and ecological conservation degree are increased by 0 52 and 0 37 under optimized conventional operation chart and by 1 72 and 0 27 under optimized ecological operation chart respectively compared with that under the conventional operation chart 1 099 billion kw h and 92 34 there is an increase trend in power generation after incorporating the limited ecological curve this is because the lower limited ecological curve converts part of the reduced output zone of the operation chart into lower limited ecological zone which can increase the release when the reservoir water level is low during the impoundment period with more storage capacity of reservoirs less spilled water and increased power generation flow could be expected however the average ecological conservation degree under optimized ecological operation chart is 0 1 lower than that under optimized conventional operation chart under hydrological extreme conditions the incidence of ecological damage under optimized ecological operation chart is decreased by 5 and 3 33 compared with that under conventional operation and optimized conventional operation chart respectively for the mds reservoir the annual average power generation and ecological conservation degree are increased by 3 99 and 0 96 under optimized conventional operation chart and by 5 99 and 1 13 under optimized ecological operation chart respectively compared with that under the conventional operation chart 1 169 billion kw h and 82 33 under hydrological extreme conditions the incidence of ecological damage under optimized ecological operation chart is decreased by 22 78 and 6 11 compared with that under conventional operation and optimized conventional operation chart respectively using optimized ecological operation chart the hydropower generation of mds increased by 70 04 million kw h compared with baseline condition using the conventional operation chart which is relatively higher than the improvement of js 18 90 kw h this is because more inflow is expected for mds reservoir after optimized regulated by js reservoir in the upper river reach and the joint operation technique of these two reservoirs could better utilize the natural runoff to increase the hydropower production benefits in general the optimized ecological operation chart results in an increase in the power generation and ecological benefits for both js and mds reservoirs the discharge rates of js and mds reservoirs under different operation charts are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively it shows that the discharges that lie outside the discharge range cannot guarantee a 70 ecological conservation degree which are denoted by symbols mds reservoir suffers from frequent ecological damage occurrence 26 67 using conventional operation chart when performance is optimized by optimized ecological operation chart the frequency has dramatically reduced to 3 89 however the frequency of ecological damage for js reservoir only reduced from 6 to 1 this is because the lower limit of ecological discharge range downstream js is quite low so the ecological conservation target 70 could easily be met even using conventional operation chart for most of the year although the frequency of ecological damage is only reduced by 5 the ecological conservation degree may significantly increase during these months for example in august 1988 and august 2001 the ecological conservation degree of js was 53 66 and 59 13 using conventional operation chart respectively but it correspondingly increased to 74 01 and 81 31 after operation chart optimization in addition under the conventional operation the discharge rate for the js reservoir is higher than the upper limit of the discharge range in july and august and lower than the lower limit of the discharge range in october and november in most cases whereas that for the mds reservoir is higher than the upper limit of the discharge range in september and october and lower than the lower limit of the discharge range in march and april in most cases in general the optimized operation chart can result in an obvious reduction in the frequency of the ecological damage and a smaller difference in the discharge within a year the ecological conservation degrees of js and mds reservoirs during the whole study period and the ecological damage months are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively for the js reservoir the downstream average ecological conservation degree follows the order of conventional operation chart optimized conventional operation chart optimized ecological operation chart fig 9b clearly shows that optimized conventional operation chart contributes to ecological conservation mostly in months with slight ecological damage with a minimum ecological conservation degree of 53 07 while optimized ecological operation chart results in a more significant reduction in ecological damage with an ecological conservation degree of 63 in most ecological damage months and a minimum ecological conservation degree of 60 84 for the mds reservoir the downstream average ecological conservation degree also follows the order of conventional operation chart optimized conventional operation chart optimized ecological operation chart with a minimum ecological conservation degree of 45 49 48 08 and 48 08 respectively however due to the limited storage capacity the operation chart cannot effectively improve the downstream ecological conservation degree under hydrological extreme conditions the failure of optimized ecological operation chart in achieving satisfactory ecological guarantee rate can be attributed to 1 in months with very low inflow the reservoir water level is the dead water level at the beginning of impounding and thus even the discharge of all inflow cannot guarantee the lower limit of the discharge range for 70 ecological conservation degree for instance in june 1980 even when the inflow of the upstream js reservoir is completely discharged the inflow of the mds reservoir 87 03 m³ s is lower than the lower limit of the discharge range for 70 ecological conservation degree 157 89 m³ s in this month the minimum ecological discharge could be satisfied by the water transfer project while 2 in months with high inflow there is a possibility for the discharge rate to exceed the upper limit of the discharge range due to the limited regulation storage of the reservoir and the optimized operation alone cannot solve the problem for instance in october 1981 the inflow of the mds reservoir is 1210 53 m³ s and the water level is increased from the dead water level in early october to the normal storage water level in late october thus resulting in a reduction in the discharge rate to 1111 85 m³ s which is higher than the upper limit of the discharge range for 70 ecological conservation degree 963 87 m³ s in this month the similar performance was also exhibited in both optimized conventional operation chart and conventional chart apart for the aforementioned reasons the lack of limited ecological curves would aggravated ecological damages for example in april 2000 dry period the ecological conservation degree of mds was 59 5 and 64 1 using conventional operation chart and optimized conventional operation chart respectively failing to meet the basic ecological degree target in comparison the incorporation of limited ecological curves could reduce the releasing of mds reservoir in advance and to increase the releasing in dry period as the result the ecological conservation degree has increased to 70 after optimized by optimized ecological operation chart 4 4 stochastic runoff simulation operation to investigate the impacts of runoff uncertainty on the proposed operation chart we have simulated the stochastic monthly inflow sequence for 30 years using first order markov model lei et al 2018 tan et al 2018 based on the characteristics of historical runoff from 1981 to 2010 figs 11 and 12 show the comparison between observed and simulated monthly inflow of js and mds reservoirs respectively the magnitude and variation of simulated low and peak runoff basically conforms to that of the observed runoff also the multi year average of simulated stochastic monthly inflow 136 m3 s for js and 285 17 for mds is basically consistent with that of observations 135 m3 s for js and 284 73 m3 s for mds then the stochastic monthly inflow sequence was used to simulate the operation of js and mds according to the conventional operation chart and the optimized ecological operation chart in fig 6 optimized ecological operation chart still indicates a better performance as shown in table 6 as for js reservoir the annual average power generation and ecological conservation degree are respectively increased by 1 50 and 0 99 after optimization compared with the conventional operation chart 1 123 billion kw h and 91 66 the ecological damage frequency also decreases by 4 45 as for mds reservoir a significant optimization performance is detected with 14 09 increase in total power generation and 20 28 decrease in ecological damage frequency therefore the optimized operation chart has a good adaptability to the uncertainty in the natural streamflow 4 5 trade off between hydropower production and ecological conservation in order to achieve a trade off between power generation and ecological conservation the optimization results obtained using different weights and minimum ecological conservation degrees are compared the weights α 1 and α 2 are set to 0 3 and 0 7 0 5 and 0 5 and 0 7 and 0 3 and the minimum ecological conservation degree is set to 50 60 70 80 and 90 respectively the annual average power generation and downstream ecological conservation degree for the js and mds reservoirs during 1981 2010 under different optimization charts are shown in fig 13 and their ecological damage frequencies are shown in fig 14 fig 13 shows that for the js reservoir mds reservoir and js mds cascade reservoirs as the weight of ecological conservation degree α 1 increases the annual average output decreases and the downstream average ecological conservation degree increases given the same weight as the ecological conservation target increases the annual average output of the js reservoir mds reservoir and js mds cascade reservoirs decreases while the average ecological conservation degree increases at first and then decreases fig 13c clearly shows that cascade ecological benefits slowly increase with the ecological conservation target rising from 50 to 70 and remain stable as the ecological conservation target rising from 70 to 80 the power generation and ecological benefits are satisfactory at an ecological conservation target of 70 but both of them are reduced significantly when the ecological conservation target exceeds 80 this is because with the increase of the ecological conservation target the water level of the lower limited ecological curve is increased thus resulting in less ecological discharge at a relatively higher water level as a consequence the output is reduced and the water storage of the reservoir is increased thus resulting in a reduction in the total power generation in addition the decrease in available storage and surplus water can result in discharges exceeding the upper limit of the ecological conservation target and thus results in a reduction in the ecological conservation degree fig 14 shows that the ecological conservation target can have a more significant effect on the ecological damage frequency than the ecological conservation degree weight α 1 in general the ecological damage frequency increases with increasing ecological conservation target this is because the higher the ecological conservation target the stricter the ecological discharge range would be ie the lower boundary of the ecological flow range would increase while the upper boundary would decrease therefore the discharge of reservoirs would be more frequent to be out the desired ecological discharge range resulting in an increase in the ecological damage frequency optimized operation can effectively reduce ecological damage frequency importantly the reduction in ecological damage frequency increases and then decreases with the increase of ecological conservation target for the js reservoir the reduction in ecological damage frequency is obvious at an ecological conservation target of 70 90 the most significant reduction is observed at an ecological conservation target of 80 at which the ecological damage frequency under optimized operation 4 is 11 lower than that under conventional operation 14 72 however the reduction is low at an ecological conservation target of 60 for the mds reservoir the ecological damage frequency under optimized operation is 24 lower than that under conventional operation at an ecological conservation target of 70 80 but it is smaller at an ecological conservation target of 60 5 conclusions in this study ecological requirements are incorporated into the operation charts of multipurpose hydropower systems which is capable of improving power generation and ecological protection and alleviating ecological damage as much as possible under extremely wet or dry conditions the operation chart optimization model with the objective of maximizing both power generation and ecological conservation was established and resolved by dpsa and then the limited ecological curves derived from reverse calculation method were incorporated into the operation chart a case study was performed with js and mds reservoirs some important conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the optimized operation chart results in an increase in power generation and ecological benefits for both js and mds reservoirs compared with the conventional operation chart the optimized conventional operation chart results in an increase in the annual average power generation and ecological conservation degree by 0 52 and 0 37 for the js reservoir and by 3 99 and 0 96 for the mds reservoir respectively 2 the incorporation of limited ecological curves into the operation chart makes it possible to further reduce ecological damage frequency and extent compared with optimized conventional operation chart the optimized ecological operation chart results in a 3 33 decrease in the ecological damage frequency and a 7 77 decrease in the maximum ecological damage extent for the js reservoir and a 6 11 decrease in the ecological damage frequency for the mds reservoir respectively 3 the optimization of reservoir operation chart and the incorporation of limited ecological curves can significantly improve power generation and ecological benefits of js mds cascade reservoirs the optimized ecological operation chart results in a 3 86 increase in annual average output of the js mds cascade reservoirs a 0 70 increase in ecological conservation degree and a 13 89 decrease in ecological damage frequency as compared with conventional operation chart 4 as the ecological conservation target increases the annual average output of the js reservoir mds reservoir and js mds cascade reservoirs decreases while the average ecological conservation degree increases at first and then decreases however the power generation and ecological benefits decrease rapidly when the ecological conservation target exceeds 80 at an ecological conservation target of 70 80 the optimized operation results in a 14 18 reduction in ecological damage frequency the adaptability of this novel operation chart has been confirmed with the potential to be easily applied to other hydropower stations that suffer from the operation conflicts between electric production and ecological conservation objectives as for the future it can also be used to propose a new operation chart that better adapt to the changing climate based on the long term runoff predictions in addition this optimized operation chart only considered the overall ecological degree and ecological damage frequency in hydrological extremes a possible extension of this research includes the incorporation of

25229,incorporating limited ecological curves a novel operation chart optimization method is proposed for the multipurpose hydropower systems which is capable of improving power generation and overall ecological condition and alleviating ecological degradation under extreme dry or wet conditions the method mainly includes 1 determine the optimal ecological discharge using weighted usable area discharge curve based on the physical habitat simulation model phabsim and 2 establish the operation chart optimization model aiming to maximizing power generation and overall ecological condition and solve the model with dpsa then 3 derive the limited ecological curves and incorporate them in the operation chart a case study is performed with jasajiang js and madushan mds reservoirs on the yuan river in southwestern china the results show that the optimized operation charts result in a 1 72 and 5 99 increase in hydropower generation and a 0 27 and 1 13 increase in ecological conservation degree for mds reservoir respectively in addition the frequency of ecological damage is reduced from 6 11 to 1 11 for js reservoir and from 26 67 to 3 89 for js and mds reservoirs respectively a further discussion using a time series of random runoff generated by first order markov model has confirmed the adaptability of this operation chart the feasibility and potential applications of this operation chart has been confirmed keywords optimized operation chart limited ecological curve ecological conservation degree cascade hydropower stations 1 introduction in recent years there have been increasing concerns over the ecological impacts of the extensive construction of cascade hydropower stations despite their high aquatic productivity and great hydropower potential wang 2017 the construction of cascade reservoirs can dramatically alter the flow regime of rivers suen and eheart 2006 and thus ecological requirements should be incorporated into the operation chart of hydropower stations to balance ecological protection and other important functions operation chart is a practical and widely used reservoir scheduling rule it is usually derived by the reverse calculation method cheng et al 2010 specifically a few typical hydrological years are selected based on historical runoff data the water balance formula is used for the reverse calculation of the water level from the end of the dry season to the beginning of impounding as shown in fig 1 the upper and lower envelopes of all indicator water levels lines are derived as the basic guiding curves upper basic guiding curve and lower basic guiding curve on the basis of that increased and decreased output curve could be derived by increasing or decreasing the basic guiding curve at a certain ratio nevertheless a potential problem is that the calculation is cumbersome and needs to be modified manually xie et al 2015 considerable attempts have been made to optimize reverse operation charts as shown in table 1 however it is noted that most previous studies on operation chart optimization have focused on water supply power generation and flood control with less attention to potential ecological impacts table 1 summarizes recent advancement in ecological operation and operation chart optimization of reservoirs in particular zhou and guo 2013 attempted to incorporate ecological requirements into the operating rule curves of multipurpose reservoirs for adaptation to climate changes the objective of which was to maximize the ecological benefits however although this makes it possible to maximize overall ecological benefits ecological deterioration cannot be totally avoided under hydrological extreme conditions in addition some ecological operation models just used the minimum ecological flow or ecological guarantee rate as the constraint guo et al 2018 wen et al 2018 which can effectively avoid dramatic ecological failure under hydrological extreme conditions however there is no technique to maximize the overall ecological condition of the basin that is it cannot effectively improve the overall ecological benefits given the complexity of operation chart optimization the ecological discharge is usually taken as a constant estimated by the tennant method or other simple methods tharme 2003 however the demand of fish species for ecological discharge can vary dynamically depending on their growth cycles there have been extensive studies on the ecological discharge regimes which can be categorized into four groups namely hydrological hydraulics habitat simulation and holistic methodologies hydrological methods and hydraulics methods mainly focus on hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of rivers while neglecting aquatic organisms demands for habitats in comparison the habitat simulation and holistic methods are proposed based on field investigation and experiments which reflects the more realistic preferences of aquatic species in particular the habitat simulation method is more suitable for micro habitat simulation while the integrated method is more appropriate for macro habitat simulation spence and hickley 2000 the physical habitat simulation model phabsim bovee and milhous 1978 is one of the classical models proposed in the early 1970 s which can simulate habitat area for aquatic creatures it is also widely used in ecological flow determination booker and dunbar 2004 johnson et al 2017 since it can provide insights into how the hydraulic habitat of fish species changes in response to the alteration of flow regime and thus determine the optimal ecological streamflow based on habitat flow curves for example gibbins et al 2001 determined the ecologically acceptable river flow regimes of kielder reservoir and water transfer system using phabsim wen et al 2016 quantified the ecological demand using phabsim which was then incorporated into the cascade reservoir operating schemes based on the quantification of ecological requirements by wen et al 2016 we derived the limited ecological curves and incorporated them into optimal operation charts for multipurpose hydropower systems which was capable of improving power generation and ecological conservation and alleviating ecological degradation as much as possible under hydrological extreme conditions a case study was then performed with the jiasajiang js and madushan mds cascade hydropower stations in the yuan river basin in southwestern china and cyprinus rubrofuscus lacépède and b rutilus were selected as the representative fish of the downstream reach of js reservoir and mds reservoir respectively phabsim was initially used to simulate the relationship between the stream flow and physical habitat of fish species and determine the optimal ecological discharge range for a given river reach the operation chart optimization model with the goal of maximizing power generation and ecological conservation was established and resolved by dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa algorithm then the limited ecological curve a new guiding curve which reflects basic ecological demand in practical operation was derived and incorporated into the operation chart 2 research area and data the yuan river is located in southwestern china with a total length of 692 km and a drainage area of 34 629 km2 two main tributaries lishe river and lvzhi river join at the sanjiangkou to form the yuan river fig 2 and then it flows through the southwestern china and vietnam before emptying into the sea the yuan river basin has high aquatic productivity and hydropower potential however the utilization of water resources is restricted to the main reach of the river while most branches and the upper reach of the river are essentially unexplored the jiasajiang js and madushan mds cascade hydropower stations are the largest hydropower stations on the yuan river whose main functions are power generation and ecological protection js an annual regulated reservoir locates at the upstream of mds reservoir it is equipped with three hydropower units the maximum output and discharge capacity of each unit are 90 mw and 90 m³ s respectively mds is a seasonal regulated reservoir located at downstream reach of js with smaller storage capacity it also has three hydropower units the maximum output and discharge capacity of each unit is 96 mw and 163m³ s respectively the basic parameters of these two reservoirs are shown in table 2 the monthly average runoff data were collected at the dam site of js and mds reservoirs from january 1981 to december 2010 in most times in a year water is released passing through the hydropower units if huge flood hits the basin the spillway would be used to increase the releasing in this case the releasing water would pass through both hydropower units and spillways 3 methodology 3 1 physical habitat simulation model phabsim bovee and milhous 1978 is proposed to simulate the relationship between the streamflow and the physical habitat for various life stages of fish species and then to determine the optimal ecological discharge for a given river reach it is considered as one of the earlier models to simulate the area of habitat for creatures and widely used in ecological flow calculation currently in the world booker and dunbar 2004 johnson et al 2017 phabsim consists of hydraulic simulation and habitat modeling waddle 2001 the mansq model manning s equation is used in the hydraulic simulation to determine the depth and velocity of the stream while the habitat suitability index hsi bovee 1986 which can reflect the preference of target fish species with regards to flow velocity depth and channel properties is used in the habitat modelling to obtain the weighted usable areas wua petts and maddock 1994 for each fish species and its life stages and the wua discharge curve can be obtained through phabsim the best ecological flow rate could be estimated via flow versus wua relations corresponding to the vertex point with the largest wua value however the ideal situation that releases the exact best ecological flow can hardly be achieved in practical operation of cascaded reservoirs here the optimal ecological requirements are expressed as the discharge range associated with the upper area of a certain proportion of maximum wua projected by wua discharge relationship to provide more flexibility to balance hydropower and ecological conservation objectives this certain proportion is defined as the ecological conservation degree r and it could also be calculated as the ratio of wua value of any timestep t to the maximum wua value as shown in eq 1 as an example a schematic of this procedure with 70 is shown in fig 3 1 r t w u a t w u a t max 100 where w u a t is the weighted usable areas of any timestep t w u a t max is the largest weighted usable area value projected by wua discharge curve if the runoff is in the optimal ecological flow range q1 q2 in following fig 3 or the conservation degree is larger than the selected conservation degree objective 70 as an example here then we consider the ecological condition is conserved in this situation if not then the ecological condition is damaged 3 2 operation chart optimization of cascade reservoirs 3 2 1 framework the objective of the conventional reservoir operation chart is to maximize the power generation without considering the ecological impacts on the river basin thereby often resulting in degradation of river ecosystems in order to address these problems we propose a new approach to determine the optimal operation chart for multipurpose hydropower systems which is capable of improving power generation and ecological conservation and alleviating ecological damage as much as possible under hydrological extreme conditions this approach consists of the following steps 1 optimize the original guiding curve of the conventional operation chart with the goal of maximizing power generation and ecological conservation as a result the optimization model is established and used to solve the optimal reservoir operation chart which can improve the power generation of multipurpose hydropower systems and the average ecological conservation degree and 2 a limited ecological curve is incorporated to address the ecological impacts under hydrological extreme conditions and improve the ecological conservation in the downstream areas this is because in extremely wet or dry years ecological damage can occur sometimes even with the use of the optimal operation chart obtained in step 1 the ecological discharge range can be determined from the wua discharge curve the upper limited ecological curve is derived using the upper boundary of the ecological discharge range and the area above the upper limited ecological curve is the upper limited ecological zone zoneⅴ similarly the area below the lower limited ecological curve is the lower limited ecological zone zoneⅰ as shown in fig 4 the operation chart is proposed based on the time series of historical monthly average streamflow so it generates a monthly based decision rule here namely the monthly average output or the monthly average release when the reservoir water level falls in the upper lower limited ecological zone then the release should equal to the upper or lower boundary of the ecological discharge range respectively in addition the limited ecological zone has the priority over other guiding curves when the limited ecological zone overlaps with other zones in the operation chart the reservoir releasing should follow the operation rules in limited ecological zone in addition when the reservoir water level falls in the reduced output zone zoneⅱ or increased output zone zoneⅳ then the hydropower plant should correspondingly reduce or increase the output in the guaranteed output zone zoneⅲ the planet should be running maintaining the firm capacity 3 2 2 ecology hydropower generation operation chart optimization model 3 2 2 1 objective functions hydropower generation and ecological conservation are the main objectives of js and mds reservoirs thus the following two objective functions are considered in the proposed optimization model 1 maximizing ecological conservation degree 2 e 1 max 1 n t i 1 n t 1 t r i t where e 1 is the average ecological conservation degree for reservoir n n 1 n and time period t t 1 t and ri t is the ecological conservation degree corresponding to the discharge of hydropower station i during the period t 2 maximizing the total power generation 3 e 2 max i 1 n t 1 t k i q i t h i t δ t where e 2 is the total power generation mw h n and t have the same meaning as the previous equation q i t is the turbine release of hydropower station i during the period t m³ s k i is the output efficiency of hydropower station i h i t is the average water head of hydropower station i during the period t m and δ t is the time step s a multi objective problem can be converted into a single objective one using weights that measure the importance of each objective eum et al 2012 in this study the multi objective function is converted into the following single objective one 4 max e max i 1 2 α i e i i 1 2 α i 1 e i e i e i where e is the total objective α i is the weight and it reflects the preference of decision makers for power generation and ecological benefit e i is the average of sub objective function e i and e i is the normalized sub objective function 3 2 2 2 constraints the following constraints are considered in this study 1 the shape of the guiding curves which do not cross 5 z i t min d i t j 1 d i t j d i t j 1 z i t max i 1 2 n t 1 2 t j 1 2 k where k is the number of guiding curves d i t j is the water level at the j th guiding curve of the operation chart i during the period t d i t j 1 and d i t j 1 are the points above and below the current guiding curve in the same period and z i t min and z i t max are the minimum and maximum water level limits of reservoir i during the period t m³ respectively the target of this constraint is guiding curves in conventional operation chart if the guiding curves cross reasonable operation zones cannot be formed 2 water balance constraints 6 v i t 1 v i t i i t q i t δ t i 1 2 n t 1 2 t where v i t is the storage of reservoir i during the period t m³ i i t is the inflow of reservoir i during the period t m³ s and q i t is the outflow of reservoir i during the period t m³ s 3 reservoir storage limits 7 v i t min v i t v i t max i 1 2 n t 1 2 t where v i t min and v i t max are the minimum and maximum storage limits of reservoir i during the period t m³ respectively 4 output constraints 8 n i min n i t n i max i 1 2 n t 1 2 t where n i t is the power output of hydropower station i during the period t w and n i min and n i max are the minimum and maximum power output of hydropower station i w respectively 5 outflow constraints 9 q i t min q i t q i t max i 1 2 n t 1 2 t where q i t min and q i t max are the minimum and maximum outflow a total discharge considering both power generation and spill of reservoir i during the period t m³ s respectively 3 2 3 optimization algorithm the reservoir operation chart optimization is a multi dimensional and multi stage optimization problem there are many commonly used optimization algorithms such as dynamic programing and some evolutionary algorithms ea such as genetic algorithm ga and differential evolution algorithm de dp is not an appropriate approach for such a multi dimensional and multi stage problem because of curse of dimensionality nandalal and bogardi 2007 most of the evolutionary algorithms eas have been successfully applied in reservoir operation strategies optimization hossain and el shafie 2013 however operation chart optimization is different since the guiding curves have divided the reservoir storage into several zones in the operation chart it is possible that the optimization technique could propose the same releasing policy in different guiding curve combinations which would affect the crossover and variation process of the eas resulting in the unstable optimization performance dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa is effective in solving multidimensional problems larson and korsak 1970 it decomposes the multidimensional problem into a sequence of one dimensional problems by optimizing over one state variable at a time which can be used for the development of optimal storage guide curves opan 2010 shim et al 2002 and zhang et al 2015 used dpsa for reducing the spatial dimensionality of the multiple reservoirs to optimize the operation of multi reservoir systems furthermore global optimization techniques generate initial operation chart in the modelling optimization randomly while the dpsa algorithm requires to input the initial solution manually usually conventional operation chart is employed to alleviate the randomness and uncertainty of randomly generated initial status thus dpsa was used to resolve the operation chart optimization model as shown in fig 5 the conventional operation chart is taken as the initial operation chart and the optimization process are summarized as follows step 1 within the permitted scope discrete the current point and the values of other points on the operation chart are fixed step 2 to the different discrete points implement simulation calculation respectively then update the current point with the point that can maximize the objective step 3 in the same way perform the steps 1 and 2 to the other points on the operation chart end up with a new operation chart step 4 calculate the difference between the new operation chart and the initial one using eq 10 10 d c 1 c 2 s 1 s k 1 k c 1 s k c 2 s k where c 1 s k and c 2 s k are the water level of guiding curve s in operation charts c1and c2 during the period k respectively step 5 if the difference meets the accuracy criteria then stop counting otherwise take the operation chart as a new initial operation chart and then proceed to the next round of optimization 3 2 4 the limited ecological curves the limited ecological curves can be used to mitigate ecological damage under extremely dry or wet conditions which consists of the upper and the lower limited ecological curves however it is important to note that these limited ecological curves are not hard constraints which can cause the problem of no solution under extremely dry or wet conditions it is a very flexible regulation technique which can reduce the frequency and extent of ecological damage under extremely dry or wet conditions and it can also make adaptive adjustments in case of conflict with other important objectives the limited ecological curve can be derived as follows 1 lower limited ecological curve the dry years are selected and the water balance formula is used for the reverse calculation of the water level from the end of the dry season to the beginning of the wet season according to the inflow rate and the lower boundary of the ecological discharge range the upper envelope curve of the water level in each dry year is the lower limited ecological curve and 2 upper limited ecological curve the wet years are selected and the water balance formula is also used for the reverse calculation of the water level from the end of impounding to the beginning of impounding according to the inflow rate and the upper boundary of the ecological discharge range the lower envelope curve of the reservoir water level in each wet year is the upper limited ecological curve 4 results and discussion 4 1 determination of ecological discharge cyprinus rubrofuscus lacépède and bagarius rutilus ng et kottelat refered to as b rutilus hereafter are chosen as the target fish species of the yuan river due to their genetic diversity and great economic values the natural resource conservation region of cyprinus rubrofuscus lacépède is located at the downstream of the js reservoir however the habitat and population of b rutilus have decreased significantly in recent years and now most of them live in the downstream areas of the mds reservoir wen et al 2016 obtained the relationship between wua and the flow rate for different lifestages of cyprinus rubrofuscus lacépède and b rutilus in the yuan river based on the phabsim model the optimal ecological discharge range for the two fish species at an ecological conservation degree of 70 are shown in table 3 4 2 optimization of multipurpose reservoir operation chart the optimized operation charts are derived based on the monthly average runoff data from january 1981 to december 2010 the ecological conservation degrees and weights in the objective function should be adjusted dynamically during the operation according to both current and desired conditions for example α 1 0 5 and α 2 0 5 are used in the objective function and the ecological conservation degree is set to 70 as for the parameter estimation of dpsa the distance accuracy is 0 5 and 2 for the guiding curves and the operation charts respectively in this study the performance of three operation charts including conventional operation chart optimized conventional operation chart and optimized ecological operation chart are compared as summarized in table 4 the conventional operation chart acts as the baseline condition which refers to the current guiding curves without optimization the optimized conventional operation chart is obtained by multi objective optimization of the conventional operation chart without consideration of ecological curves while optimized ecological operation chart is obtained by further addition of the limited ecological curves fig 6 shows the operation charts of the js and mds reservoirs these operation zones refer to the relationship between water level and operation strategy there are seven zones in the optimized ecological operation chart of the js reservoir including the lower limited ecological zone the zone between the dead water level and the lower limited ecological curve reduced output zone guaranteed output zone 1 5 times increased output zone 2 times increased output zone full capacity output zone and upper limited ecological zone the zone between the normal water level and the upper limited ecological curve from the bottom to the top compared with conventional operation chart the limited ecological zones are incorporated into the optimized ecological operation chart in the wet season june november the upper basic guiding curve of the optimized ecological operation chart moves down and the increased output zone is enlarged to increase output and reduce surplus water the lower basic guiding curve moves up in the midterm wet season august september and the output would be reduced in case of less inflow to increase water storage for power generation in the dry season there are five zones in the optimized ecological operation chart of the seasonal regulated mds reservoir including the lower limited ecological zone reduced output zone guaranteed output zone increased output zone and upper limited ecological zone from the bottom to the top compared with the conventional operation chart the increased output zone in the optimized ecological operation chart is enlarged in the late wet season october november to increase output and reduce surplus water because the reservoir has a large inflow but a small storage capacity during this period 4 3 optimization performance of js mds cascade reservoirs using the time series of monthly inflow from 1981 to 2010 the operation of js and mds reservoirs were simulated using the conventional operation chart optimized conventional operation chart and optimized conventional operation chart as shown in fig 6 generating the corresponding releasing policy in terms of monthly outflow respectively and the results are shown in table 5 the situation in which the ecological conservation degree is lower than the target 70 defined in this study is referred to as ecological damage for the js reservoir the annual average power generation and ecological conservation degree are increased by 0 52 and 0 37 under optimized conventional operation chart and by 1 72 and 0 27 under optimized ecological operation chart respectively compared with that under the conventional operation chart 1 099 billion kw h and 92 34 there is an increase trend in power generation after incorporating the limited ecological curve this is because the lower limited ecological curve converts part of the reduced output zone of the operation chart into lower limited ecological zone which can increase the release when the reservoir water level is low during the impoundment period with more storage capacity of reservoirs less spilled water and increased power generation flow could be expected however the average ecological conservation degree under optimized ecological operation chart is 0 1 lower than that under optimized conventional operation chart under hydrological extreme conditions the incidence of ecological damage under optimized ecological operation chart is decreased by 5 and 3 33 compared with that under conventional operation and optimized conventional operation chart respectively for the mds reservoir the annual average power generation and ecological conservation degree are increased by 3 99 and 0 96 under optimized conventional operation chart and by 5 99 and 1 13 under optimized ecological operation chart respectively compared with that under the conventional operation chart 1 169 billion kw h and 82 33 under hydrological extreme conditions the incidence of ecological damage under optimized ecological operation chart is decreased by 22 78 and 6 11 compared with that under conventional operation and optimized conventional operation chart respectively using optimized ecological operation chart the hydropower generation of mds increased by 70 04 million kw h compared with baseline condition using the conventional operation chart which is relatively higher than the improvement of js 18 90 kw h this is because more inflow is expected for mds reservoir after optimized regulated by js reservoir in the upper river reach and the joint operation technique of these two reservoirs could better utilize the natural runoff to increase the hydropower production benefits in general the optimized ecological operation chart results in an increase in the power generation and ecological benefits for both js and mds reservoirs the discharge rates of js and mds reservoirs under different operation charts are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively it shows that the discharges that lie outside the discharge range cannot guarantee a 70 ecological conservation degree which are denoted by symbols mds reservoir suffers from frequent ecological damage occurrence 26 67 using conventional operation chart when performance is optimized by optimized ecological operation chart the frequency has dramatically reduced to 3 89 however the frequency of ecological damage for js reservoir only reduced from 6 to 1 this is because the lower limit of ecological discharge range downstream js is quite low so the ecological conservation target 70 could easily be met even using conventional operation chart for most of the year although the frequency of ecological damage is only reduced by 5 the ecological conservation degree may significantly increase during these months for example in august 1988 and august 2001 the ecological conservation degree of js was 53 66 and 59 13 using conventional operation chart respectively but it correspondingly increased to 74 01 and 81 31 after operation chart optimization in addition under the conventional operation the discharge rate for the js reservoir is higher than the upper limit of the discharge range in july and august and lower than the lower limit of the discharge range in october and november in most cases whereas that for the mds reservoir is higher than the upper limit of the discharge range in september and october and lower than the lower limit of the discharge range in march and april in most cases in general the optimized operation chart can result in an obvious reduction in the frequency of the ecological damage and a smaller difference in the discharge within a year the ecological conservation degrees of js and mds reservoirs during the whole study period and the ecological damage months are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively for the js reservoir the downstream average ecological conservation degree follows the order of conventional operation chart optimized conventional operation chart optimized ecological operation chart fig 9b clearly shows that optimized conventional operation chart contributes to ecological conservation mostly in months with slight ecological damage with a minimum ecological conservation degree of 53 07 while optimized ecological operation chart results in a more significant reduction in ecological damage with an ecological conservation degree of 63 in most ecological damage months and a minimum ecological conservation degree of 60 84 for the mds reservoir the downstream average ecological conservation degree also follows the order of conventional operation chart optimized conventional operation chart optimized ecological operation chart with a minimum ecological conservation degree of 45 49 48 08 and 48 08 respectively however due to the limited storage capacity the operation chart cannot effectively improve the downstream ecological conservation degree under hydrological extreme conditions the failure of optimized ecological operation chart in achieving satisfactory ecological guarantee rate can be attributed to 1 in months with very low inflow the reservoir water level is the dead water level at the beginning of impounding and thus even the discharge of all inflow cannot guarantee the lower limit of the discharge range for 70 ecological conservation degree for instance in june 1980 even when the inflow of the upstream js reservoir is completely discharged the inflow of the mds reservoir 87 03 m³ s is lower than the lower limit of the discharge range for 70 ecological conservation degree 157 89 m³ s in this month the minimum ecological discharge could be satisfied by the water transfer project while 2 in months with high inflow there is a possibility for the discharge rate to exceed the upper limit of the discharge range due to the limited regulation storage of the reservoir and the optimized operation alone cannot solve the problem for instance in october 1981 the inflow of the mds reservoir is 1210 53 m³ s and the water level is increased from the dead water level in early october to the normal storage water level in late october thus resulting in a reduction in the discharge rate to 1111 85 m³ s which is higher than the upper limit of the discharge range for 70 ecological conservation degree 963 87 m³ s in this month the similar performance was also exhibited in both optimized conventional operation chart and conventional chart apart for the aforementioned reasons the lack of limited ecological curves would aggravated ecological damages for example in april 2000 dry period the ecological conservation degree of mds was 59 5 and 64 1 using conventional operation chart and optimized conventional operation chart respectively failing to meet the basic ecological degree target in comparison the incorporation of limited ecological curves could reduce the releasing of mds reservoir in advance and to increase the releasing in dry period as the result the ecological conservation degree has increased to 70 after optimized by optimized ecological operation chart 4 4 stochastic runoff simulation operation to investigate the impacts of runoff uncertainty on the proposed operation chart we have simulated the stochastic monthly inflow sequence for 30 years using first order markov model lei et al 2018 tan et al 2018 based on the characteristics of historical runoff from 1981 to 2010 figs 11 and 12 show the comparison between observed and simulated monthly inflow of js and mds reservoirs respectively the magnitude and variation of simulated low and peak runoff basically conforms to that of the observed runoff also the multi year average of simulated stochastic monthly inflow 136 m3 s for js and 285 17 for mds is basically consistent with that of observations 135 m3 s for js and 284 73 m3 s for mds then the stochastic monthly inflow sequence was used to simulate the operation of js and mds according to the conventional operation chart and the optimized ecological operation chart in fig 6 optimized ecological operation chart still indicates a better performance as shown in table 6 as for js reservoir the annual average power generation and ecological conservation degree are respectively increased by 1 50 and 0 99 after optimization compared with the conventional operation chart 1 123 billion kw h and 91 66 the ecological damage frequency also decreases by 4 45 as for mds reservoir a significant optimization performance is detected with 14 09 increase in total power generation and 20 28 decrease in ecological damage frequency therefore the optimized operation chart has a good adaptability to the uncertainty in the natural streamflow 4 5 trade off between hydropower production and ecological conservation in order to achieve a trade off between power generation and ecological conservation the optimization results obtained using different weights and minimum ecological conservation degrees are compared the weights α 1 and α 2 are set to 0 3 and 0 7 0 5 and 0 5 and 0 7 and 0 3 and the minimum ecological conservation degree is set to 50 60 70 80 and 90 respectively the annual average power generation and downstream ecological conservation degree for the js and mds reservoirs during 1981 2010 under different optimization charts are shown in fig 13 and their ecological damage frequencies are shown in fig 14 fig 13 shows that for the js reservoir mds reservoir and js mds cascade reservoirs as the weight of ecological conservation degree α 1 increases the annual average output decreases and the downstream average ecological conservation degree increases given the same weight as the ecological conservation target increases the annual average output of the js reservoir mds reservoir and js mds cascade reservoirs decreases while the average ecological conservation degree increases at first and then decreases fig 13c clearly shows that cascade ecological benefits slowly increase with the ecological conservation target rising from 50 to 70 and remain stable as the ecological conservation target rising from 70 to 80 the power generation and ecological benefits are satisfactory at an ecological conservation target of 70 but both of them are reduced significantly when the ecological conservation target exceeds 80 this is because with the increase of the ecological conservation target the water level of the lower limited ecological curve is increased thus resulting in less ecological discharge at a relatively higher water level as a consequence the output is reduced and the water storage of the reservoir is increased thus resulting in a reduction in the total power generation in addition the decrease in available storage and surplus water can result in discharges exceeding the upper limit of the ecological conservation target and thus results in a reduction in the ecological conservation degree fig 14 shows that the ecological conservation target can have a more significant effect on the ecological damage frequency than the ecological conservation degree weight α 1 in general the ecological damage frequency increases with increasing ecological conservation target this is because the higher the ecological conservation target the stricter the ecological discharge range would be ie the lower boundary of the ecological flow range would increase while the upper boundary would decrease therefore the discharge of reservoirs would be more frequent to be out the desired ecological discharge range resulting in an increase in the ecological damage frequency optimized operation can effectively reduce ecological damage frequency importantly the reduction in ecological damage frequency increases and then decreases with the increase of ecological conservation target for the js reservoir the reduction in ecological damage frequency is obvious at an ecological conservation target of 70 90 the most significant reduction is observed at an ecological conservation target of 80 at which the ecological damage frequency under optimized operation 4 is 11 lower than that under conventional operation 14 72 however the reduction is low at an ecological conservation target of 60 for the mds reservoir the ecological damage frequency under optimized operation is 24 lower than that under conventional operation at an ecological conservation target of 70 80 but it is smaller at an ecological conservation target of 60 5 conclusions in this study ecological requirements are incorporated into the operation charts of multipurpose hydropower systems which is capable of improving power generation and ecological protection and alleviating ecological damage as much as possible under extremely wet or dry conditions the operation chart optimization model with the objective of maximizing both power generation and ecological conservation was established and resolved by dpsa and then the limited ecological curves derived from reverse calculation method were incorporated into the operation chart a case study was performed with js and mds reservoirs some important conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the optimized operation chart results in an increase in power generation and ecological benefits for both js and mds reservoirs compared with the conventional operation chart the optimized conventional operation chart results in an increase in the annual average power generation and ecological conservation degree by 0 52 and 0 37 for the js reservoir and by 3 99 and 0 96 for the mds reservoir respectively 2 the incorporation of limited ecological curves into the operation chart makes it possible to further reduce ecological damage frequency and extent compared with optimized conventional operation chart the optimized ecological operation chart results in a 3 33 decrease in the ecological damage frequency and a 7 77 decrease in the maximum ecological damage extent for the js reservoir and a 6 11 decrease in the ecological damage frequency for the mds reservoir respectively 3 the optimization of reservoir operation chart and the incorporation of limited ecological curves can significantly improve power generation and ecological benefits of js mds cascade reservoirs the optimized ecological operation chart results in a 3 86 increase in annual average output of the js mds cascade reservoirs a 0 70 increase in ecological conservation degree and a 13 89 decrease in ecological damage frequency as compared with conventional operation chart 4 as the ecological conservation target increases the annual average output of the js reservoir mds reservoir and js mds cascade reservoirs decreases while the average ecological conservation degree increases at first and then decreases however the power generation and ecological benefits decrease rapidly when the ecological conservation target exceeds 80 at an ecological conservation target of 70 80 the optimized operation results in a 14 18 reduction in ecological damage frequency the adaptability of this novel operation chart has been confirmed with the potential to be easily applied to other hydropower stations that suffer from the operation conflicts between electric production and ecological conservation objectives as for the future it can also be used to propose a new operation chart that better adapt to the changing climate based on the long term runoff predictions in addition this optimized operation chart only considered the overall ecological degree and ecological damage frequency in hydrological extremes a possible extension of this research includes the incorporation of impacts assessment of optimized operation chart on downstream eco hydrological system acknowledgements this research is funded by national natural science foundation of china u1765201 51609061 the
