10600,the response of both surface runoff and subsurface drainage as affected by water table management practices in tile drained fields is poorly documented widely used to simulate management effects on crop production and water quality the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 has recently been equipped with a subirrigation component coupled with simultaneous heat and water shaw model to improve its hydrological responses to cold climates the hybrid rz shaw has never been tested for simulating surface runoff and subsurface drainage under controlled drainage with subirrigation system the objective of this study was to evaluate the model performance in predicting surface runoff subsurface tile drainage and crop yield under regular drainage dr and controlled drainage with subirrigation cds for the first time the rz shaw model was calibrated and validated against tile drainage surface runoff and crop yield data collected in a tile drained field in harrow ontario from june 2008 to december 2011 under dr and cds treatments despite occasional underestimation in winter and overestimation in summer the model was performing generally satisfactorily in simulating the accumulated subsurface drainage and runoff under both dr and cds treatments with percent bias pbias within 15 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse 0 5 and the index of agreement ioa 0 75 overall the rz shaw was capable of predicting the subsurface drainage and surface runoff under both dr and cds treatment and it provided reliable estimation for the impact of water table management practice on et and crop yield but its accuracy for simulating events of peak flow was not as precise for the cds treatment than dr treatment keywords controlled drainage subirrigation runoff shaw rzwqm2 crop yield 1 introduction though frequently reported as an essential management practice to remove excess water from agricultural field and promote crop productivity in humid areas in north america subsurface drainage also increases non point source pollution by enhancing the movement of agricultural nutrients sediments and pesticides to shallow groundwater and surface water resources tan et al 1993 1998 2002a b gaynor et al 1995 zhang et al 2015 sadhukhan et al 2019a therefore controlled drainage has been extensively utilized as agricultural beneficial management practice bmp which potentially reduces tile effluent n p and bacteria fluxes by lowering tile drainage rates through the control structure as well as boosts crop yield tan et al 1993 drury et al 2009 tan and zhang 2011 sunohara et al 2016 despite the fact that removing excess water is crucial in humid regions to avoid wet stress for crops subirrigation may also be inevitable to provide additional water during the dry years when precipitation is not enough to meet the water demand of crops in growing season baule et al 2017 compared to field experiments that may take decades and vast resources to complete the modeling approach is faster and more efficient when the models can be calibrated and validated using short term site specific data liu et al 2011 process based models have been widely evaluated as reliable tools to simulate crop growth nutrient dynamics and transport as well as water movement under various conditions consequently they were extensively applied to predict the long term effects of different climate and management practices on agricultural production and water quality ma et al 2007a b thorp et al 2007 2008 qi et al 2011 thereby to provide mitigation and adaptation bmps to maximize sustainability goals for farmers and policymakers plaza bonilla et al 2015 uzoma et al 2015 wang et al 2016 jiang et al 2019a numbers of hydrological models are capable of simulating the subsurface drainage and surface runoff in the field scale for example the adapt sands et al 2003 macro kuzmanovski et al 2015 creams gleams chinkuyu et al 2005 knisel and douglas mankin 2012 rzwqm2 jiang et al 2019b kuzmanovski et al 2015 wepp savabi 1993 and drainmod sands et al 2003 luo et al 2000 skaggs et al 2012 these models have been expanded to simulate the nutrient and chemical losses through soil water movement under different soil conditions among which the rzwqm2 has been ranked as the top model top of nine agricultural system models for simulating hydrologic and nutrient processes mclaughlin 2001 as a one dimensional process based model the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 simulates water movement biological processes and solute transport in agricultural crop systems the hydrologic processes represented in rzwqm2 include subsurface drainage surface runoff evaporation plant transpiration infiltration lateral flow and deep seepage an accurate prediction of surface runoff is very important because surface runoff correlated with loss of pesticides sediments and other agricultural chemicals into groundwater unlike other runoff models when hydrologic events occur rzwqm2 calculates runoff in real time ahuja et al 2000 soil hydrologic processes are handled in sub daily time steps from 5 to 60 min overcoming many difficulties encountered with daily time step models once a model has been verified and tested adequately it can be applied to predict the impacts of various agricultural management practices on the hydrologic cycle environment and crop production ma et al 2005b rzwqm2 is unique for its strong ability to comprehensively simulate hydrological balance greenhouse gas emissions water quality n and p losses cn cycling crop growth under various agricultural management practices including tillage cover crops rotation system manure application inorganic fertilizers and irrigation and residual management rzwqm2 has been tested for different locales hydrologic and crop yield parameters and agronomic practices soil water transport under tile drainage in nashua iowa singh and kanwar 1995 nitrogen cycling and organic matter in a

jiang et al 2019a and phosphorus losses sadhukhan et al 2019a sadhukhan et al 2019 in eastern canada climate change impacts on water quality hydrological balance and crop growth in iowa us wang et al 2015 and xinjiang china chen et al 2019 the early version of rzwqm2 used by ahmed et al 2007 had simplified snowmelt routines rendering it unable to handle frozen soil which was one of the key factors affecting infiltration drainage runoff and erosion however due to lack of winter data at the experiment sites winter and early spring drainage were not investigated in that study ahmed et al 2007 suggested that improving the snow algorithms in rzwqm2 might provide better simulation for northern climates to strengthen the capability of rzwqm2 in addressing freeze thaw processes one of the most detailed snow and freezing soil models simultaneous heat and water shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989a was incorporated into rzwqm2 flerchinger et al 2000 as a widely used model to simulate freezing thaw procedure shaw was capable to address residue and tillage effects on the water cycle under the freeze thaw process flerchinger and hanson 1989 flerchinger and saxton 1989b hayhoe 1994 flerchinger et al 2000 reported that rz shaw outperformed shaw in simulating soil temperature the hybrid rz shaw model has been evaluated for simulating soil temperature and evaporation under different tillage systems kozak et al 2006 2007 energy balance under different soil surface conditions yu et al 2007 as well as soil water balance crop temperature and soil surface temperature ma et al 2012a b li et al 2012 these studies showed better performance of the hybrid rz shaw model than the original rzwqm2 and shaw models individually when concerning heat transfer in soil crop and water there is a critical need to understand the hydrology in freeze thaw and snowmelt conditions for the winter and early spring seasons in cold climates like eastern canada because theses processes are major hydrological events of the year in these regions enright and madramootoo 2004 model capability for estimating drainage and runoff during winter and spring seasons is critical to simulate nutrient losses in peak events during snowmelt accurately thereby to assess management practices impacts on water quality management sands et al 2003 the performance of drainmod for predicting subsurface drainage flow in cold climates has been evaluated as satisfactory in manitoba satchithanantham and ranjan 2015 and quebec dayyani et al 2009 chikhaoui et al 2010 morrison et al 2014 tested the modified drainmod for predicting both the subsurface and runoff under spring snowmelt conditions in southern quebec indicating an inadequate model performance for predicting monthly subsurface drainage nse 0 6 and 0 4 and surface runoff nse 0 2 in two different sites though rzwqm2 was firstly tested for simulating the subsurface drainage under cds in southern quebec by jiang et al 2018 after the subirrigation component was incorporated the authors demonstrated that the model was not performing satisfactorily for estimating tile drainage in freezing and thawing period during winter and spring seasons under both dr and cds systems therefore the objective of this study was to explore the ability of rz shaw model to predict surface runoff subsurface tile drainage and crop yield under dr and cds at a site near harrow ontario in a region with cold winters the novel features of this study are that in evaluating the model rz shaw s subirrigation component is tested for the first time and surface runoff and subsurface tile drainage are modeled over the full year in particular during freezing and thawing period during winter and early spring 2 materials and methods 2 1 rzwqm2 overview developed by the usda ars scientists the comprehensive rzwqm2 model simulates crop production hydrologic cycle fate and transport of nutrients and pesticides under different climate patterns and agronomic management practices it is a one dimensional model which simulates the vertical movement of water the subsurface drainage is calculated from the hooghoudt s steady state equation which is intended to correct for the 2 dimensional effects of tile drainage by estimating this flux at the center point between 2 parallel drains however the rzwqm2 can be a pseuo two dimensional model which simulates the lateral flow using the product of lateral ksat multiplied by lateral hydraulic gradient when high water table presents the rzwqm2 simulates water flow through two domains soil matrix and macropore channels the upper boundary of the model is characterized by the infiltration and soil evaporation at the top layer of soil while an impermeable layer below the bottom layer is assumed as the bottom boundary the deep seepage below the bottom boundary is set to 0 hybridized with dssat 4 0 crop models the rzwqm2 can simulate 23 crop species and their varietal characteristics as well as turf and trees ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2005a 2006 for soil heat transfer soil water and surface energy balance it runs on a sub hourly time step and on a daily time step for plant growth pesticides and n balance ma et al 2012a b the model can discriminate up to ten layers of soil and devotes 200 event slots for management practices such as planting dates manure and pesticide applications and tillage soil water retention is described using the brooks corey equation brooks and corey 1964 the green ampt approach is used to compute the water infiltration from rainfall snowmelt and irrigation green and ampt 1911 the excess water flows into macropores if present when rainfall intensity exceeds the simulated infiltration rate the model employs richard s equation to simulate water redistribution in the soil profile in the absence of macropores or if they are filled the excess water leaves the soil surface as runoff ahuja et al 2000 the shaw model was linked to rzwqm2 to simulate ice in soil snow accumulation snowmelt as well as soil freeze thaw cycles the shaw model enables the rzwqm2 to simulate varying management scenarios long term crop rotations surface conditions and management for multiple seasons flerchinger et al 2000 the energy balance in the canopy residue snowpack and soil layers soil water freeze thaw ice content and soil temperature are simulated by the shaw model while the other water movement processes in soil are predicted by rzwqm flerchinger et al 2000 the rzwqm model computes the evaporative flux soil water content plant growth while the shaw model adjusts the soil temperature and revised soil water content from freeze thaw process which is only called when soil water is redistributed li et al 2012 the calculated results from two models are exported and imported from each other at each time step subsequently the water table depth is updated after redistribution of moisture and tile drainage is calculated as a function of the updated water table depth in rz shaw model singh and kanwar 1995 2 2 field experiment initialized from 1991 the experimental site is located on a brookston clay loam soil at the eugene f whalen experimental farm in southwestern ontario 42 13 n 82 44 w with a slope between 0 05 to 0 1 the soil contains 28 sand 35 silt and 37 clay the average soil bulk density ρ is 1 34 mg m 3 the average porosity is 52 4 and the soil hydraulic conductivity ks is between 17 and 119 mm d 1 with a mean saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of 50 mm d 1 qiao 2013 the whole site was composed of sixteen different plots 67 1 m 15 2 m with eight treatment combinations four fertilization treatments and two water management treatments fig 1 tan et al 2009 impermeable double layer 4 mm thick plastic barriers were installed vertically from the surface to a depth of 1 2 m to prevent subsurface water from infiltrating into adjacent plots three corrugated and perforated tile drains pipes with a diameter of 10 2 cm were located at 0 80 m depth in the soil and ran parallel to the length of the plot the spacing between each tile drains was 3 8 m which was the same as the spacing between the edge of the plot and the tile drain collection basins were set up at the end of the downslope to collect surface runoff both the tile drainage and surface runoff were then individually transported to an instrumentation building via subsurface tubes and their flow rates were continuously monitored and recorded by 32 automatic gauges tan et al 2009 as shown in table 1 the water sample collecting periods were scheduled into 17 different periods due to the limitation for separating the water flow events sadhukhan et al 2019a sadhukhan et al 2019b four plots receiving same fertilization treatment p draw down dd with two different water table management regular drainage plots 2 16 and controlled drainage with subirrigation plots 8 11 were selected for current study the rz shaw model was evaluated against continuously measured drainage runoff and crop yield data from june 1 2008 to december 22 2011 from plot 2 8 11 and 16 fig 1 the regular drainage treatment dr without an outlet riser mimicked the typical subsurface drainage employed in that region of ontario the controlled drainage with subirrigation system cds used an outlet riser to control water table and to allow subirrigation during the cropping season the riser under cds treatment was set at 0 2 m depth from the soil surface during the growing season and 0 36 m depth from soil surface during the non growing season the cds treatment was temporarily set to the regular drainage dr mode during planting and harvesting field operations under the cds treatment water was pumped into drain pipe during the growing season to increase the water level in the field and provided the irrigation water directly to the crop root zone madramootoo et al 1993 tan et al 2007 the cropping system used in this study was a corn soybean rotation with corn zea mays l grown in even years and soybean glycine max l merr grown in odd years table 2 after harvest on november 1 of 2008 2009 and 2010 soil was tilled using a chisel plow while in the very wet fall of 2011 tillage was postponed until the following spring the corn received 200 kg n ha 1 of nh4no3 155 kg no3 n and 45 kg n of nh4 n and 100 kg k ha 1 of kcl on june 25 2008 and june 23 2010 the selected four plots were fertilized with only inorganic n and k fertilizer as draw down treatment which were designed to investigate the effect of absence of p fertilization on patterns of crop yield and water quality over time tan and zhang 2011 2 3 model input precipitation air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed are required for the rzwqm2 to operate the required weather data were obtained from the automated meteorological weather station at the whelan farm located less than 0 5 km from the experiment site tan et al 2009 sadhukhan et al 2019a sadhukhan et al 2019b since rain gauge problems led to the inaccurate measurements during the winter period of october 1 2008 to april 30 2009 the precipitation data during that period was downloaded from the harrow weather station station id 6133362 latitude 42 03 n longitude 82 9 w of environment canada https climate weather gc ca which is located 16 6 km away from the study site hourly rainfall was converted to breakpoint form in the rzwqm2 model the annual precipitation for 2008 was 866 mm 2009 was 873 mm 2010 was 755 mm and 2011 was 1428 mm the soil profiles were represented as six layers 0 0 25 0 25 0 45 0 45 0 80 0 80 1 20 1 20 3 00 3 00 3 09 m each described in terms of mean bulk density ρ measured in 2010 particle density porosity and fraction of sand clay slit table 3 soil physical properties were measured to a maximum depth of 1 2 m therefore the soil physical properties assigned to the deeper layers were kept as the same with 0 80 1 20 m layer for the calibration treatment the model used the average soil fraction of plots 2 and 16 two water table management treatments regular drainage dr and controlled drainage with subirrigation cds were set up through the hydraulic control tab of rzwqm2 in the dr treatment the water table depth was fixed at 0 64 m from 2008 to 2011 for the cds treatment water table depth was controlled at two depths 0 36 m and 0 20 m below soil surface throughout the 4 year experimental period as shown in table 4 subirrigation was not applied in 2008 the total quantities of subirrigation water applied in 2009 2010 and 2011 were 122 mm june 19 september 14 125 mm july 14 september 8 and 23 mm july 19 september 16 respectively since no specific irrigation dates or amounts were recorded for the experiment site in tan and zhang 2011 subirrigation timing and quantity on a day to day basis was estimated according to irrigation requirements daily precipitation minus daily simulated et on specific day during the growing season days of low precipitation required more irrigation water the irrigation application rate was 2 mm h 1 in the rzwqm2 model 2 4 model initialization the initial nutrient conditions were set using the model s initialization wizard with organic matter fraction values table 3 for the different soil layers set based on values from a site with a similar soil type located in the same region in southern ontario ahmed et al 2007 20 of total organic carbon toc was partitioned in the fast and intermediate humus pool in each layer and 80 in the slow humus pool toc was set at 10 in the fast humus pool between fast and intermediate pool in the rzwqm2 the model was then able to calculate and display the n profile automatically other parameters including c n ratio and chemical parameters for all nutrient components in rzwqm2 were set to default values the initial water temperature was set at 15 c and the tensionmetric potential ranged from 200 cm to 0 cm the initial conditions of water profile and temperature were determined by making sure that simulated subsurface drain flow began approximately when the subsurface drain flow actually began in the field 2 5 model parameterization measure surface runoff subsurface tile drainage and crop yield data from dr treatment plot 2 and plot 16 were used to calibrate the model and subsequently the model was validated using data sets from the cds treatment plot 8 and plot 11 in order to get a reasonable prediction of subsurface tile drainage and surface runoff the soil hydraulic parameters were adjusted to reduce the errors between observed and simulated data table 3 since k sat is the input parameter for hooghoudt s equation it is considered as the primary hydrologic parameter influencing subsurface tile flow walker et al 2000 runoff was also highly relevant with k sat value because it occurred when the precipitation rate exceeded the infiltration rate which was controlled by k sat at the soil surface the measured k sat among different layers in selected plots were ranged from 0 07 to 0 50 cm h 1 calibrated k sat was adjusted based on the soil hydraulic parameters default value table from rawls et al 1982 in which k sat was 0 23 cm h 1 for clay loam soil this k sat value resulted in underestimated simulated water flow therefore k sat was adjusted to a higher value aimed at increasing the simulated water flow the soil s saturated water content θ sat was assumed equal to the soil s porosity for bubbling pressure the value was adjusted slightly within a reasonable range based on the default values for each soil type to reduce error between simulated and observed tile drainage rawls et al 1982 which ended up resulting in a similar bubbling pressure value 15 as that reported in thorp et al 2007 decreasing bubbling pressure of the second and third layers of soil would increase tile drainage in contrast high bubbling pressure indicated that the soil retained more water making it difficult for water to move down through the soil profile thereby decreasing tile drainage but increasing surface runoff the lateral hydraulic gradient parameter was adjusted to zero for controlling lateral flow losses and for a better match of simulated and observed subsurface tile drainage lateral saturated conductivity lk sat a major parameter to calculate subsurface tile drainage flow in hooghoudt s equation was adjusted to 2 k sat to match the drainage peaks as suggested by ma et al 2012a b increasing lk sat resulted in higher predicted value for tile drainage albedos of dry soil wet soil and fresh residue were kept at default values of 0 2 0 3 and 0 22 respectively while the crop albedo at maturity was adjusted from 0 7 to 0 5 thereby to obtain a reasonable simulation of annual et the surface soil resistance for the s w pet was adjusted to 200 s m 1 to reduce soil evaporation and the minimal leaf stomatal resistance for both corn and soybean was set to 250 s m 1 to reduce crop transpiration so that the simulated tile drainage and runoff were well matched with observed values surface residues also affected et because when surface residues increased more water was allowed to reach the drains thereby decreasing et walker et al 1994 and subsequently increasing tile drainage and runoff walker et al 2000 using the default value for surface residue resulted in overestimating et and underestimating tile drainage in the current study therefore the surface residue value was increased to 0 8 to adjust et to a reasonable level bakhsh et al 2001 calibrated crop parameters are given in table 5 growing degree days gdd base temperature of 8 c from seedling emergence to end of juvenile phase p1 was adjusted to 190 well within the range of 100 450 recommended by ma et al 2011 a value of 685 was used for the thermal time from silking to physiological maturity p5 both p1 and p5 values were adjusted in order to match the physiological maturity of corn over its growth period the maturity dates of corn under the dr treatment were october 14 in 2008 and october 18 in 2010 while for the cds treatment the maturity dates were october 7 in 2009 and october 8 in 2011 for soybean time between first seed and physiological maturity sd pm was adjusted to the maximum value at 38 days to best match the maturity date however the predicted crop s maturity was still not reached so critical short day length cdsl and slope of the relative response of development to photoperiod with time ppsen were set as 13 4 and 0 285 respectively to match the observed soybean maturity date the modified cdsl value was within the range of 11 and 15 and the adjusted ppsen value was within the range of 0 129 and 0 349 as recommended by ma et al 2011 time between plant emergence and flower appearance em fl was set at 19 days so as to adjust the flowering date and obtain reasonable simulation of yield similarly the time between first flower and first seed fl sd was adjusted to 12 for the model output to match observed yield the denitrification rate was adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between observed crop yields and simulated crop yields the application of n fertilizers had significant impacts on denitrification elmi et al 2005 who found elevated denitrification rates at under corn fertilized at a rate of 200 kg n ha 1 showed this microbial process to decrease n o 3 n in the soil solution in the present study the denitrification rate was adjusted because the model s default rate resulted in a denitrification loss of roughly 200 kg n ha 1 year 1 indicating that nearly all the applied n fertilizer 200 kg ha 1 was denitrified this further resulted in estimated low corn yield having adjusted the denitrification rate to 1 10 14 in the calibrated model thorp et al 2007 n losses through denitrification were between 7 g ha 1 day 1 and 40 g ha 1 day 1 under the dr treatment and between 5 g ha 1 day 1 and 109 g ha 1 day 1 under the cds treatment our simulated denitrification rates were consistent with the values reported by elmi et al 2005 who found growing season may to october denitrification rates of between 2 g ha 1 day 1 and 33 g ha 1 day 1 under a free drainage treatment and between 4 g ha 1 day 1 and 105 g ha 1 day 1 under cds for the same fertilization rate of 200 kg n ha 1 2 6 model evaluation criteria it is common to use statistical methods to judge the performance of model simulations three of the most frequently used quantitative statistics for hydrologic models including the percent of bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and index of agreement ioa were adapted to evaluate the rz shaw model moriasi et al 2007 pbias measures the difference in mean values between simulated and observed data and nse is an indicator of the goodness of fit in terms of variance ranging from to 1 the nse is a normalized statistic that describes the relative magnitude of the variance between simulated and measured data the model performance is considered perfect when nse equals to 1 while the value below 0 indicated unacceptable performance the ioa determines the degree of model prediction error which varies from 0 to 1 and the value of 1 indicates optimal match the statistic methods are defined as follows 1 p b i a s 100 i 1 i n o i s i i 1 i n o i 2 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 i o a 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i p o i o 2 where n is the number of data points si is the ith simulated datum oi is the ith observed datum and o is the mean of observed values for surface runoff and subsurface tile drainage model performance is considered as acceptable when pbias is within 15 ahmed et al 2007 nse 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 and ioa 0 75 moriasi et al 2015 model performance for predicting crop yield was evaluated using pbias and when within 15 the model performance was considered acceptable 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration in the model calibration phase under the treatment of dr the model was performing well to predict both the subsurface drainage and surface runoff through the period from june 1 2008 to december 22 2011 the total accumulated measured subsurface drainage and surface runoff were 1540 mm and 307 mm while the simulated values were 1350 mm and 306 mm respectively fig 2 depicts the simulated and observed subsurface drainage and surface runoff under the dr treatment and the statistics are shown in table 6 statistical analysis showed a good model performance for both subsurface tile drainage pbias 12 3 nse 0 62 ioa 0 91 and surface runoff pbias 0 1 nse 0 74 ioa 0 96 in the model calibration according to the model justification criteria the pbias was within 15 nse 0 5 and ioa 0 75 for both drainage and runoff indicating that rz shaw satisfactorily predicted both the magnitudes of total water flows and the peak flows under dr treatment the year of 2011 was very wet with a total precipitation amount of 1428 mm therefore the peak of subsurface tile drainage 257 mm was observed in period 14 march 24 2011 to june 22 2011 fig 2a due to significant rainfall events 384 mm and spring snowmelt the rz shaw successfully predicted the highest drainage flow in this period with the total amount of 252 mm however the model underestimated tile drainage for the dr treatment during the winter months period 4 october 23 2008 to february 11 2009 in this period subsurface drainage was underestimated and the observed vs simulated discrepancy was greatest largely due to underestimated infiltration through frozen soil and underestimated snowmelt snowmelt simulation in rz shaw model is computed based on air temperature soil surface temperature wetness of soil wind transport etc however while soil surface temperature is different from the air temperature the rz shaw model assumes the soil surface temperature to be equal to the mean daily air temperature possibly contributing to simulation error in addition the underestimation of tile drainage in period 4 may come from the high simulated soil water storage increment from oct 23 2008 to feb 11 2009 which increased from 1291 mm to 1452 mm furthermore the inaccuracy of prediction in subsurface drainage in winter and early spring may come from the snow sublimation the rz shaw model does not include a snow sublimation component whereas in reality snow sublimation might occur under high temperatures although model perfectly predicted the surface runoff for the dr plots in the calibration phase over the period of 2008 2011 with a low bias of 0 1 and high nse of 0 74 fig 2b table 6 runoff was somewhat underestimated in the winter and overestimated in the summer because rzwqm2 is very sensitive to rainfall intensity schwartz and shuman 2005 when faced with high precipitation the model tended to over predict surface runoff in contrast on low rainfall days simulated runoff was generally nil in reality the fully developed plant canopy intercepted rainfall decreasing the intensity and amount of rainfall reaching the soil surface the intercepted rainfall was carried to rhizosphere where the soil was generally looser than other areas affording the rainfall a better chance to infiltrate deeper rather than participating to being lost as surface runoff therefore since the model did not consider this situation simulated surface runoff would exceed observed runoff ma et al 1998a the rz shaw simulated daily runoff based on a constant initial ρ however in reality ρ kept changing over during years leading to uncertainties in simulated infiltration and surface runoff an increase in ρ will result in less infiltration and more surface runoff ma et al 1998b some soil processes e g reconsolidation are affected by rainfall leading to changes in soil properties such as ρ soil porosity and k sat this in turn results in differences between observed and model simulated surface runoff in our study a chisel plow was applied after the crop was harvested in november therefore soil ρ at the field scale was lower in the winter than in the summer after soil reconsolidation this may explain the underestimated runoff in the winter and overestimated runoff in summer 3 2 model validation a comparison between simulated and observed subsurface drainage and surface runoff under cds treatment was plotted in fig 2c d the total measured subsurface drainage and surface runoff over the validation period were 695 mm and 960 mm respectively while the simulated values were 788 mm and 917 mm accordingly suggesting a reliable model performance in estimating accumulated water flows with the pbias at 13 5 and 4 5 respectively table 6 statistics were in acceptable ranges for both subsurface tile drainage nse 0 52 ioa 0 88 and runoff nse 0 56 ioa 0 86 suggesting an satisfactory model performance for predicting the peak flows of both tile drainage and surface runoff under the cds treatment the predicted annual tile drainage under cds treatment was 211 mm which is reasonable as compared to the historical observed value of approximate 200 mm from 1992 to 1994 tan et al 2002a b generally the subsurface tile drainage was underestimated during the winter from 2008 to 2009 period 4 10 23 2008 2 11 2009 but overestimated the remainder of the time the surface runoff followed the similar trends overestimation during the summer months but underestimated during the winter spring time these discrepancies between simulated and observed data sets in the cds treatment could be explained by a number of reasons i subirrigation was estimated by calculation leading to inaccuracies in amount and date ii plot to plot variation though plots 8 and 11 received identical treatments there were variances in observed tile drainage and surface runoff between two plots during the 17 periods iii gaps in measured data could lead to deviations in the simulated data sets and observed data sets in the current study the nse values from the rz shaw simulation for subsurface drainage were 0 62 and 0 52 while nse for surface runoff were 0 74 and 0 56 under the dr and cds treatments respectively although model validation showed less accuracy than for calibration in terms of statistics the rz shaw performed generally well in estimating accumulated and peak flows for both subsurface drainage and surface runoff under cds treatment our prediction suggested that hybrid rz shaw model provided more accurate prediction for subsurface drainage in cold regions than rzwqm2 which was evaluated in southern quebec by jiang et al 2018 under dr pbias 30 nse 0 18 and cds treatments pbias 43 nse 0 39 moreover our results were also better than the reported values by morrison et al 2014 who tested the modified drainmod to simulate subsurface drainage nse 0 6 and 0 2 for two sites and surface runoff nse 0 4 sunder spring snowmelt conditions in quebec 3 3 soil water balance the simulated soil water balances for the precipitation irrigation soil water storage actual evaporation actual transpiration deep seepage subsurface tile drainage and surface runoff under dr and cds treatments were presented in table 7 the simulated annual et over the full experimental period 2008 2011 was 495 mm and 509 mm for the dr and cds treatment respectively which were in line with the measured et 430 mm under dr and 552 mm under cds obtained by a water balance approach in a field study conducted at the same site in 1992 1994 tan et al 2002a b moreover our simulated annual et was also comparable with the simulated mean et value of 468 mm for tile drained sites in southern ontario ahmed et al 2007 though this value was believed to represent an underestimation for dr treatment the simulated partitions of rainfall to drainage runoff and et were 36 8 and 51 which is comparable to the equivalent values of 30 8 and 55 from 1992 to 1994 at the same site observed by tan et al 2002a b under cds treatment 20 of the total annual water inputs precipitation plus subirrigation 1047 mm year 1 were partitioned into simulated subsurface drainage while 22 and 49 water inputs went to surface runoff and et 3 of water inputs contributed the increment of soil water storage for both dr and cds treatments which was lower than the observed value of 7 by tan et al 2002a b as shown in table 7 the annual precipitation over the whole study period was adequate to meet the crop water requirement under dr treatment and the soil water storage kept increasing each year the annual water supply of 67 mm from subirrigation resulted in 58 mm greater deep seepage while the crop transpiration was not increased our simulation suggested that the cds treatment resulted in greater surface runoff but less tile drainage than dr over the study period tan et al 2002a b also reported that cds treatment significantly reduced p 0 05 tile drainage and increased surface runoff than the dr treatment the total accumulated simulated drainage under the cds treatment was 41 less than that under the dr treatment which was lower than the site observed difference of 33 between two water table management by tan and zhang 2011 mean annual surface runoff from the cds treatment 231 mm was significantly higher 200 than that from the dr treatment 77 mm somewhat less than the 406 difference noted in tan and zhang 2011 3 4 crop growth statistical analysis of crop yield simulation for both calibration and validation under the dr and cds treatment suggested acceptable model performance with the pbias within 15 within the four years table 8 although tan and fulton 1980 reported irrigation to be necessary for the achievement of maximum crop productivity in the study region meanwhile some studies have shown experimental evidence that cds could improve crop yield than dr stampfli and madramootoo 2006 tan et al 1997 the current study indicated that both observed and simulated corn and soybean yields in the dr and cds treatments were similar the negligible impact of cds on crop yield during the whole study period may be explained by the sufficient rainfall for crop growth the mean annual precipitation in this study was 980 mm from 2008 to 2011 approximately 15 higher than the historical average precipitation from 1947 to 1996 853 mm year 1 furthermore our simulation did not demonstrate higher crop transpiration under the cds than the dr treatment according to tan et al 2002a b the et under cds treatment showed no difference when compared to the dr treatment during the wet year of 1992 because rainfall 968 mm was adequate for crop growth although the year of 2010 received relatively low annual precipitation 755 mm the total rainfall through the growing season from may to october 511 mm was higher than the historical average 474 mm consequently almost no difference in crop yield was observed between different water table management in the year of 2010 meanwhile the difference in predicted crop yield under dr and cds was minor suggesting little water stress in these two years generally the rz shaw model was able to predict the corn and soybean yield as affected by crop water demand under different water table management however it should be noted that some studies have reported lower crop yield under cds than dr due to waterlogging issues with too much rainfall in growing season madramootoo et al 2001 jiang et al 2018 while the model did not consider the waterlogging problem when simulating crop growth 4 summary and conclusions the main objective of this study was to test the subirrigation component of the hybrid rz shaw model for the first time in predicting surface runoff subsurface drainage and crop yield under dr and cds in a cold climate region in southern ontario the model performed generally well in simulating corn and soybean yield from 2008 to 2011 under both dr and cds treatments negligible difference in crop yield was found between different water table management while the simulation also showed no water stress and similar et under dr and cds suggesting that there was adequate rainfall for crop growth within the four years although the model prediction for drainage and runoff for cds system was not as accurate as dr system statistical analysis suggested that the rz shaw model performed satisfactorily in predicting subsurface tile drainage and surface runoff under both dr and cds treatment with pbias within 15 nse 0 50 and ioa 0 75 in addition the current model evaluation demonstrated that the hybrid rz shaw model had better capability than rzwqm2 for simulating hydrological processes in cold climates however further improvement is still needed as the subsurface tile drainage and surface runoff were slightly under estimated during the wintertime when the freeze thaw process complicates the hydrologic cycle additional data collection in the winter period such as snow depth melting and hydrologic conductivity as affected by frost may help to better test and improve the model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

10600,the response of both surface runoff and subsurface drainage as affected by water table management practices in tile drained fields is poorly documented widely used to simulate management effects on crop production and water quality the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 has recently been equipped with a subirrigation component coupled with simultaneous heat and water shaw model to improve its hydrological responses to cold climates the hybrid rz shaw has never been tested for simulating surface runoff and subsurface drainage under controlled drainage with subirrigation system the objective of this study was to evaluate the model performance in predicting surface runoff subsurface tile drainage and crop yield under regular drainage dr and controlled drainage with subirrigation cds for the first time the rz shaw model was calibrated and validated against tile drainage surface runoff and crop yield data collected in a tile drained field in harrow ontario from june 2008 to december 2011 under dr and cds treatments despite occasional underestimation in winter and overestimation in summer the model was performing generally satisfactorily in simulating the accumulated subsurface drainage and runoff under both dr and cds treatments with percent bias pbias within 15 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse 0 5 and the index of agreement ioa 0 75 overall the rz shaw was capable of predicting the subsurface drainage and surface runoff under both dr and cds treatment and it provided reliable estimation for the impact of water table management practice on et and crop yield but its accuracy for simulating events of peak flow was not as precise for the cds treatment than dr treatment keywords controlled drainage subirrigation runoff shaw rzwqm2 crop yield 1 introduction though frequently reported as an essential management practice to remove excess water from agricultural field and promote crop productivity in humid areas in north america subsurface drainage also increases non point source pollution by enhancing the movement of agricultural nutrients sediments and pesticides to shallow groundwater and surface water resources tan et al 1993 1998 2002a b gaynor et al 1995 zhang et al 2015 sadhukhan et al 2019a therefore controlled drainage has been extensively utilized as agricultural beneficial management practice bmp which potentially reduces tile effluent n p and bacteria fluxes by lowering tile drainage rates through the control structure as well as boosts crop yield tan et al 1993 drury et al 2009 tan and zhang 2011 sunohara et al 2016 despite the fact that removing excess water is crucial in humid regions to avoid wet stress for crops subirrigation may also be inevitable to provide additional water during the dry years when precipitation is not enough to meet the water demand of crops in growing season baule et al 2017 compared to field experiments that may take decades and vast resources to complete the modeling approach is faster and more efficient when the models can be calibrated and validated using short term site specific data liu et al 2011 process based models have been widely evaluated as reliable tools to simulate crop growth nutrient dynamics and transport as well as water movement under various conditions consequently they were extensively applied to predict the long term effects of different climate and management practices on agricultural production and water quality ma et al 2007a b thorp et al 2007 2008 qi et al 2011 thereby to provide mitigation and adaptation bmps to maximize sustainability goals for farmers and policymakers plaza bonilla et al 2015 uzoma et al 2015 wang et al 2016 jiang et al 2019a numbers of hydrological models are capable of simulating the subsurface drainage and surface runoff in the field scale for example the adapt sands et al 2003 macro kuzmanovski et al 2015 creams gleams chinkuyu et al 2005 knisel and douglas mankin 2012 rzwqm2 jiang et al 2019b kuzmanovski et al 2015 wepp savabi 1993 and drainmod sands et al 2003 luo et al 2000 skaggs et al 2012 these models have been expanded to simulate the nutrient and chemical losses through soil water movement under different soil conditions among which the rzwqm2 has been ranked as the top model top of nine agricultural system models for simulating hydrologic and nutrient processes mclaughlin 2001 as a one dimensional process based model the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 simulates water movement biological processes and solute transport in agricultural crop systems the hydrologic processes represented in rzwqm2 include subsurface drainage surface runoff evaporation plant transpiration infiltration lateral flow and deep seepage an accurate prediction of surface runoff is very important because surface runoff correlated with loss of pesticides sediments and other agricultural chemicals into groundwater unlike other runoff models when hydrologic events occur rzwqm2 calculates runoff in real time ahuja et al 2000 soil hydrologic processes are handled in sub daily time steps from 5 to 60 min overcoming many difficulties encountered with daily time step models once a model has been verified and tested adequately it can be applied to predict the impacts of various agricultural management practices on the hydrologic cycle environment and crop production ma et al 2005b rzwqm2 is unique for its strong ability to comprehensively simulate hydrological balance greenhouse gas emissions water quality n and p losses cn cycling crop growth under

jiang et al 2019a and phosphorus losses sadhukhan et al 2019a sadhukhan et al 2019 in eastern canada climate change impacts on water quality hydrological balance and crop growth in iowa us wang et al 2015 and xinjiang china chen et al 2019 the early version of rzwqm2 used by ahmed et al 2007 had simplified snowmelt routines rendering it unable to handle frozen soil which was one of the key factors affecting infiltration drainage runoff and erosion however due to lack of winter data at the experiment sites winter and early spring drainage were not investigated in that study ahmed et al 2007 suggested that improving the snow algorithms in rzwqm2 might provide better simulation for northern climates to strengthen the capability of rzwqm2 in addressing freeze thaw processes one of the most detailed snow and freezing soil models simultaneous heat and water shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989a was incorporated into rzwqm2 flerchinger et al 2000 as a widely used model to simulate freezing thaw procedure shaw was capable to address residue and tillage effects on the water cycle under the freeze thaw process flerchinger and hanson 1989 flerchinger and saxton 1989b hayhoe 1994 flerchinger et al 2000 reported that rz shaw outperformed shaw in simulating soil temperature the hybrid rz shaw model has been evaluated for simulating soil temperature and evaporation under different tillage systems kozak et al 2006 2007 energy balance under different soil surface conditions yu et al 2007 as well as soil water balance crop temperature and soil surface temperature ma et al 2012a b li et al 2012 these studies showed better performance of the hybrid rz shaw model than the original rzwqm2 and shaw models individually when concerning heat transfer in soil crop and water there is a critical need to understand the hydrology in freeze thaw and snowmelt conditions for the winter and early spring seasons in cold climates like eastern canada because theses processes are major hydrological events of the year in these regions enright and madramootoo 2004 model capability for estimating drainage and runoff during winter and spring seasons is critical to simulate nutrient losses in peak events during snowmelt accurately thereby to assess management practices impacts on water quality management sands et al 2003 the performance of drainmod for predicting subsurface drainage flow in cold climates has been evaluated as satisfactory in manitoba satchithanantham and ranjan 2015 and quebec dayyani et al 2009 chikhaoui et al 2010 morrison et al 2014 tested the modified drainmod for predicting both the subsurface and runoff under spring snowmelt conditions in southern quebec indicating an inadequate model performance for predicting monthly subsurface drainage nse 0 6 and 0 4 and surface runoff nse 0 2 in two different sites though rzwqm2 was firstly tested for simulating the subsurface drainage under cds in southern quebec by jiang et al 2018 after the subirrigation component was incorporated the authors demonstrated that the model was not performing satisfactorily for estimating tile drainage in freezing and thawing period during winter and spring seasons under both dr and cds systems therefore the objective of this study was to explore the ability of rz shaw model to predict surface runoff subsurface tile drainage and crop yield under dr and cds at a site near harrow ontario in a region with cold winters the novel features of this study are that in evaluating the model rz shaw s subirrigation component is tested for the first time and surface runoff and subsurface tile drainage are modeled over the full year in particular during freezing and thawing period during winter and early spring 2 materials and methods 2 1 rzwqm2 overview developed by the usda ars scientists the comprehensive rzwqm2 model simulates crop production hydrologic cycle fate and transport of nutrients and pesticides under different climate patterns and agronomic management practices it is a one dimensional model which simulates the vertical movement of water the subsurface drainage is calculated from the hooghoudt s steady state equation which is intended to correct for the 2 dimensional effects of tile drainage by estimating this flux at the center point between 2 parallel drains however the rzwqm2 can be a pseuo two dimensional model which simulates the lateral flow using the product of lateral ksat multiplied by lateral hydraulic gradient when high water table presents the rzwqm2 simulates water flow through two domains soil matrix and macropore channels the upper boundary of the model is characterized by the infiltration and soil evaporation at the top layer of soil while an impermeable layer below the bottom layer is assumed as the bottom boundary the deep seepage below the bottom boundary is set to 0 hybridized with dssat 4 0 crop models the rzwqm2 can simulate 23 crop species and their varietal characteristics as well as turf and trees ahuja et al 2000 ma et al 2005a 2006 for soil heat transfer soil water and surface energy balance it runs on a sub hourly time step and on a daily time step for plant growth pesticides and n balance ma et al 2012a b the model can discriminate up to ten layers of soil and devotes 200 event slots for management practices such as planting dates manure and pesticide applications and tillage soil water retention is described using the brooks corey equation brooks and corey 1964 the green ampt approach is used to compute the water infiltration from rainfall snowmelt and irrigation green and ampt 1911 the excess water flows into macropores if present when rainfall intensity exceeds the simulated infiltration rate the model employs richard s equation to simulate water redistribution in the soil profile in the absence of macropores or if they are filled the excess water leaves the soil surface as runoff ahuja et al 2000 the shaw model was linked to rzwqm2 to simulate ice in soil snow accumulation snowmelt as well as soil freeze thaw cycles the shaw model enables the rzwqm2 to simulate varying management scenarios long term crop rotations surface conditions and management for multiple seasons flerchinger et al 2000 the energy balance in the canopy residue snowpack and soil layers soil water freeze thaw ice content and soil temperature are simulated by the shaw model while the other water movement processes in soil are predicted by rzwqm flerchinger et al 2000 the rzwqm model computes the evaporative flux soil water content plant growth while the shaw model adjusts the soil temperature and revised soil water content from freeze thaw process which is only called when soil water is redistributed li et al 2012 the calculated results from two models are exported and imported from each other at each time step subsequently the water table depth is updated after redistribution of moisture and tile drainage is calculated as a function of the updated water table depth in rz shaw model singh and kanwar 1995 2 2 field experiment initialized from 1991 the experimental site is located on a brookston clay loam soil at the eugene f whalen experimental farm in southwestern ontario 42 13 n 82 44 w with a slope between 0 05 to 0 1 the soil contains 28 sand 35 silt and 37 clay the average soil bulk density ρ is 1 34 mg m 3 the average porosity is 52 4 and the soil hydraulic conductivity ks is between 17 and 119 mm d 1 with a mean saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat of 50 mm d 1 qiao 2013 the whole site was composed of sixteen different plots 67 1 m 15 2 m with eight treatment combinations four fertilization treatments and two water management treatments fig 1 tan et al 2009 impermeable double layer 4 mm thick plastic barriers were installed vertically from the surface to a depth of 1 2 m to prevent subsurface water from infiltrating into adjacent plots three corrugated and perforated tile drains pipes with a diameter of 10 2 cm were located at 0 80 m depth in the soil and ran parallel to the length of the plot the spacing between each tile drains was 3 8 m which was the same as the spacing between the edge of the plot and the tile drain collection basins were set up at the end of the downslope to collect surface runoff both the tile drainage and surface runoff were then individually transported to an instrumentation building via subsurface tubes and their flow rates were continuously monitored and recorded by 32 automatic gauges tan et al 2009 as shown in table 1 the water sample collecting periods were scheduled into 17 different periods due to the limitation for separating the water flow events sadhukhan et al 2019a sadhukhan et al 2019b four plots receiving same fertilization treatment p draw down dd with two different water table management regular drainage plots 2 16 and controlled drainage with subirrigation plots 8 11 were selected for current study the rz shaw model was evaluated against continuously measured drainage runoff and crop yield data from june 1 2008 to december 22 2011 from plot 2 8 11 and 16 fig 1 the regular drainage treatment dr without an outlet riser mimicked the typical subsurface drainage employed in that region of ontario the controlled drainage with subirrigation system cds used an outlet riser to control water table and to allow subirrigation during the cropping season the riser under cds treatment was set at 0 2 m depth from the soil surface during the growing season and 0 36 m depth from soil surface during the non growing season the cds treatment was temporarily set to the regular drainage dr mode during planting and harvesting field operations under the cds treatment water was pumped into drain pipe during the growing season to increase the water level in the field and provided the irrigation water directly to the crop root zone madramootoo et al 1993 tan et al 2007 the cropping system used in this study was a corn soybean rotation with corn zea mays l grown in even years and soybean glycine max l merr grown in odd years table 2 after harvest on november 1 of 2008 2009 and 2010 soil was tilled using a chisel plow while in the very wet fall of 2011 tillage was postponed until the following spring the corn received 200 kg n ha 1 of nh4no3 155 kg no3 n and 45 kg n of nh4 n and 100 kg k ha 1 of kcl on june 25 2008 and june 23 2010 the selected four plots were fertilized with only inorganic n and k fertilizer as draw down treatment which were designed to investigate the effect of absence of p fertilization on patterns of crop yield and water quality over time tan and zhang 2011 2 3 model input precipitation air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed are required for the rzwqm2 to operate the required weather data were obtained from the automated meteorological weather station at the whelan farm located less than 0 5 km from the experiment site tan et al 2009 sadhukhan et al 2019a sadhukhan et al 2019b since rain gauge problems led to the inaccurate measurements during the winter period of october 1 2008 to april 30 2009 the precipitation data during that period was downloaded from the harrow weather station station id 6133362 latitude 42 03 n longitude 82 9 w of environment canada https climate weather gc ca which is located 16 6 km away from the study site hourly rainfall was converted to breakpoint form in the rzwqm2 model the annual precipitation for 2008 was 866 mm 2009 was 873 mm 2010 was 755 mm and 2011 was 1428 mm the soil profiles were represented as six layers 0 0 25 0 25 0 45 0 45 0 80 0 80 1 20 1 20 3 00 3 00 3 09 m each described in terms of mean bulk density ρ measured in 2010 particle density porosity and fraction of sand clay slit table 3 soil physical properties were measured to a maximum depth of 1 2 m therefore the soil physical properties assigned to the deeper layers were kept as the same with 0 80 1 20 m layer for the calibration treatment the model used the average soil fraction of plots 2 and 16 two water table management treatments regular drainage dr and controlled drainage with subirrigation cds were set up through the hydraulic control tab of rzwqm2 in the dr treatment the water table depth was fixed at 0 64 m from 2008 to 2011 for the cds treatment water table depth was controlled at two depths 0 36 m and 0 20 m below soil surface throughout the 4 year experimental period as shown in table 4 subirrigation was not applied in 2008 the total quantities of subirrigation water applied in 2009 2010 and 2011 were 122 mm june 19 september 14 125 mm july 14 september 8 and 23 mm july 19 september 16 respectively since no specific irrigation dates or amounts were recorded for the experiment site in tan and zhang 2011 subirrigation timing and quantity on a day to day basis was estimated according to irrigation requirements daily precipitation minus daily simulated et on specific day during the growing season days of low precipitation required more irrigation water the irrigation application rate was 2 mm h 1 in the rzwqm2 model 2 4 model initialization the initial nutrient conditions were set using the model s initialization wizard with organic matter fraction values table 3 for the different soil layers set based on values from a site with a similar soil type located in the same region in southern ontario ahmed et al 2007 20 of total organic carbon toc was partitioned in the fast and intermediate humus pool in each layer and 80 in the slow humus pool toc was set at 10 in the fast humus pool between fast and intermediate pool in the rzwqm2 the model was then able to calculate and display the n profile automatically other parameters including c n ratio and chemical parameters for all nutrient components in rzwqm2 were set to default values the initial water temperature was set at 15 c and the tensionmetric potential ranged from 200 cm to 0 cm the initial conditions of water profile and temperature were determined by making sure that simulated subsurface drain flow began approximately when the subsurface drain flow actually began in the field 2 5 model parameterization measure surface runoff subsurface tile drainage and crop yield data from dr treatment plot 2 and plot 16 were used to calibrate the model and subsequently the model was validated using data sets from the cds treatment plot 8 and plot 11 in order to get a reasonable prediction of subsurface tile drainage and surface runoff the soil hydraulic parameters were adjusted to reduce the errors between observed and simulated data table 3 since k sat is the input parameter for hooghoudt s equation it is considered as the primary hydrologic parameter influencing subsurface tile flow walker et al 2000 runoff was also highly relevant with k sat value because it occurred when the precipitation rate exceeded the infiltration rate which was controlled by k sat at the soil surface the measured k sat among different layers in selected plots were ranged from 0 07 to 0 50 cm h 1 calibrated k sat was adjusted based on the soil hydraulic parameters default value table from rawls et al 1982 in which k sat was 0 23 cm h 1 for clay loam soil this k sat value resulted in underestimated simulated water flow therefore k sat was adjusted to a higher value aimed at increasing the simulated water flow the soil s saturated water content θ sat was assumed equal to the soil s porosity for bubbling pressure the value was adjusted slightly within a reasonable range based on the default values for each soil type to reduce error between simulated and observed tile drainage rawls et al 1982 which ended up resulting in a similar bubbling pressure value 15 as that reported in thorp et al 2007 decreasing bubbling pressure of the second and third layers of soil would increase tile drainage in contrast high bubbling pressure indicated that the soil retained more water making it difficult for water to move down through the soil profile thereby decreasing tile drainage but increasing surface runoff the lateral hydraulic gradient parameter was adjusted to zero for controlling lateral flow losses and for a better match of simulated and observed subsurface tile drainage lateral saturated conductivity lk sat a major parameter to calculate subsurface tile drainage flow in hooghoudt s equation was adjusted to 2 k sat to match the drainage peaks as suggested by ma et al 2012a b increasing lk sat resulted in higher predicted value for tile drainage albedos of dry soil wet soil and fresh residue were kept at default values of 0 2 0 3 and 0 22 respectively while the crop albedo at maturity was adjusted from 0 7 to 0 5 thereby to obtain a reasonable simulation of annual et the surface soil resistance for the s w pet was adjusted to 200 s m 1 to reduce soil evaporation and the minimal leaf stomatal resistance for both corn and soybean was set to 250 s m 1 to reduce crop transpiration so that the simulated tile drainage and runoff were well matched with observed values surface residues also affected et because when surface residues increased more water was allowed to reach the drains thereby decreasing et walker et al 1994 and subsequently increasing tile drainage and runoff walker et al 2000 using the default value for surface residue resulted in overestimating et and underestimating tile drainage in the current study therefore the surface residue value was increased to 0 8 to adjust et to a reasonable level bakhsh et al 2001 calibrated crop parameters are given in table 5 growing degree days gdd base temperature of 8 c from seedling emergence to end of juvenile phase p1 was adjusted to 190 well within the range of 100 450 recommended by ma et al 2011 a value of 685 was used for the thermal time from silking to physiological maturity p5 both p1 and p5 values were adjusted in order to match the physiological maturity of corn over its growth period the maturity dates of corn under the dr treatment were october 14 in 2008 and october 18 in 2010 while for the cds treatment the maturity dates were october 7 in 2009 and october 8 in 2011 for soybean time between first seed and physiological maturity sd pm was adjusted to the maximum value at 38 days to best match the maturity date however the predicted crop s maturity was still not reached so critical short day length cdsl and slope of the relative response of development to photoperiod with time ppsen were set as 13 4 and 0 285 respectively to match the observed soybean maturity date the modified cdsl value was within the range of 11 and 15 and the adjusted ppsen value was within the range of 0 129 and 0 349 as recommended by ma et al 2011 time between plant emergence and flower appearance em fl was set at 19 days so as to adjust the flowering date and obtain reasonable simulation of yield similarly the time between first flower and first seed fl sd was adjusted to 12 for the model output to match observed yield the denitrification rate was adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between observed crop yields and simulated crop yields the application of n fertilizers had significant impacts on denitrification elmi et al 2005 who found elevated denitrification rates at under corn fertilized at a rate of 200 kg n ha 1 showed this microbial process to decrease n o 3 n in the soil solution in the present study the denitrification rate was adjusted because the model s default rate resulted in a denitrification loss of roughly 200 kg n ha 1 year 1 indicating that nearly all the applied n fertilizer 200 kg ha 1 was denitrified this further resulted in estimated low corn yield having adjusted the denitrification rate to 1 10 14 in the calibrated model thorp et al 2007 n losses through denitrification were between 7 g ha 1 day 1 and 40 g ha 1 day 1 under the dr treatment and between 5 g ha 1 day 1 and 109 g ha 1 day 1 under the cds treatment our simulated denitrification rates were consistent with the values reported by elmi et al 2005 who found growing season may to october denitrification rates of between 2 g ha 1 day 1 and 33 g ha 1 day 1 under a free drainage treatment and between 4 g ha 1 day 1 and 105 g ha 1 day 1 under cds for the same fertilization rate of 200 kg n ha 1 2 6 model evaluation criteria it is common to use statistical methods to judge the performance of model simulations three of the most frequently used quantitative statistics for hydrologic models including the percent of bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and index of agreement ioa were adapted to evaluate the rz shaw model moriasi et al 2007 pbias measures the difference in mean values between simulated and observed data and nse is an indicator of the goodness of fit in terms of variance ranging from to 1 the nse is a normalized statistic that describes the relative magnitude of the variance between simulated and measured data the model performance is considered perfect when nse equals to 1 while the value below 0 indicated unacceptable performance the ioa determines the degree of model prediction error which varies from 0 to 1 and the value of 1 indicates optimal match the statistic methods are defined as follows 1 p b i a s 100 i 1 i n o i s i i 1 i n o i 2 n s e 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 i o a 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i p o i o 2 where n is the number of data points si is the ith simulated datum oi is the ith observed datum and o is the mean of observed values for surface runoff and subsurface tile drainage model performance is considered as acceptable when pbias is within 15 ahmed et al 2007 nse 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 and ioa 0 75 moriasi et al 2015 model performance for predicting crop yield was evaluated using pbias and when within 15 the model performance was considered acceptable 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration in the model calibration phase under the treatment of dr the model was performing well to predict both the subsurface drainage and surface runoff through the period from june 1 2008 to december 22 2011 the total accumulated measured subsurface drainage and surface runoff were 1540 mm and 307 mm while the simulated values were 1350 mm and 306 mm respectively fig 2 depicts the simulated and observed subsurface drainage and surface runoff under the dr treatment and the statistics are shown in table 6 statistical analysis showed a good model performance for both subsurface tile drainage pbias 12 3 nse 0 62 ioa 0 91 and surface runoff pbias 0 1 nse 0 74 ioa 0 96 in the model calibration according to the model justification criteria the pbias was within 15 nse 0 5 and ioa 0 75 for both drainage and runoff indicating that rz shaw satisfactorily predicted both the magnitudes of total water flows and the peak flows under dr treatment the year of 2011 was very wet with a total precipitation amount of 1428 mm therefore the peak of subsurface tile drainage 257 mm was observed in period 14 march 24 2011 to june 22 2011 fig 2a due to significant rainfall events 384 mm and spring snowmelt the rz shaw successfully predicted the highest drainage flow in this period with the total amount of 252 mm however the model underestimated tile drainage for the dr treatment during the winter months period 4 october 23 2008 to february 11 2009 in this period subsurface drainage was underestimated and the observed vs simulated discrepancy was greatest largely due to underestimated infiltration through frozen soil and underestimated snowmelt snowmelt simulation in rz shaw model is computed based on air temperature soil surface temperature wetness of soil wind transport etc however while soil surface temperature is different from the air temperature the rz shaw model assumes the soil surface temperature to be equal to the mean daily air temperature possibly contributing to simulation error in addition the underestimation of tile drainage in period 4 may come from the high simulated soil water storage increment from oct 23 2008 to feb 11 2009 which increased from 1291 mm to 1452 mm furthermore the inaccuracy of prediction in subsurface drainage in winter and early spring may come from the snow sublimation the rz shaw model does not include a snow sublimation component whereas in reality snow sublimation might occur under high temperatures although model perfectly predicted the surface runoff for the dr plots in the calibration phase over the period of 2008 2011 with a low bias of 0 1 and high nse of 0 74 fig 2b table 6 runoff was somewhat underestimated in the winter and overestimated in the summer because rzwqm2 is very sensitive to rainfall intensity schwartz and shuman 2005 when faced with high precipitation the model tended to over predict surface runoff in contrast on low rainfall days simulated runoff was generally nil in reality the fully developed plant canopy intercepted rainfall decreasing the intensity and amount of rainfall reaching the soil surface the intercepted rainfall was carried to rhizosphere where the soil was generally looser than other areas affording the rainfall a better chance to infiltrate deeper rather than participating to being lost as surface runoff therefore since the model did not consider this situation simulated surface runoff would exceed observed runoff ma et al 1998a the rz shaw simulated daily runoff based on a constant initial ρ however in reality ρ kept changing over during years leading to uncertainties in simulated infiltration and surface runoff an increase in ρ will result in less infiltration and more surface runoff ma et al 1998b some soil processes e g reconsolidation are affected by rainfall leading to changes in soil properties such as ρ soil porosity and k sat this in turn results in differences between observed and model simulated surface runoff in our study a chisel plow was applied after the crop was harvested in november therefore soil ρ at the field scale was lower in the winter than in the summer after soil reconsolidation this may explain the underestimated runoff in the winter and overestimated runoff in summer 3 2 model validation a comparison between simulated and observed subsurface drainage and surface runoff under cds treatment was plotted in fig 2c d the total measured subsurface drainage and surface runoff over the validation period were 695 mm and 960 mm respectively while the simulated values were 788 mm and 917 mm accordingly suggesting a reliable model performance in estimating accumulated water flows with the pbias at 13 5 and 4 5 respectively table 6 statistics were in acceptable ranges for both subsurface tile drainage nse 0 52 ioa 0 88 and runoff nse 0 56 ioa 0 86 suggesting an satisfactory model performance for predicting the peak flows of both tile drainage and surface runoff under the cds treatment the predicted annual tile drainage under cds treatment was 211 mm which is reasonable as compared to the historical observed value of approximate 200 mm from 1992 to 1994 tan et al 2002a b generally the subsurface tile drainage was underestimated during the winter from 2008 to 2009 period 4 10 23 2008 2 11 2009 but overestimated the remainder of the time the surface runoff followed the similar trends overestimation during the summer months but underestimated during the winter spring time these discrepancies between simulated and observed data sets in the cds treatment could be explained by a number of reasons i subirrigation was estimated by calculation leading to inaccuracies in amount and date ii plot to plot variation though plots 8 and 11 received identical treatments there were variances in observed tile drainage and surface runoff between two plots during the 17 periods iii gaps in measured data could lead to deviations in the simulated data sets and observed data sets in the current study the nse values from the rz shaw simulation for subsurface drainage were 0 62 and 0 52 while nse for surface runoff were 0 74 and 0 56 under the dr and cds treatments respectively although model validation showed less accuracy than for calibration in terms of statistics the rz shaw performed generally well in estimating accumulated and peak flows for both subsurface drainage and surface runoff under cds treatment our prediction suggested that hybrid rz shaw model provided more accurate prediction for subsurface drainage in cold regions than rzwqm2 which was evaluated in southern quebec by jiang et al 2018 under dr pbias 30 nse 0 18 and cds treatments pbias 43 nse 0 39 moreover our results were also better than the reported values by morrison et al 2014 who tested the modified drainmod to simulate subsurface drainage nse 0 6 and 0 2 for two sites and surface runoff nse 0 4 sunder spring snowmelt conditions in quebec 3 3 soil water balance the simulated soil water balances for the precipitation irrigation soil water storage actual evaporation actual transpiration deep seepage subsurface tile drainage and surface runoff under dr and cds treatments were presented in table 7 the simulated annual et over the full experimental period 2008 2011 was 495 mm and 509 mm for the dr and cds treatment respectively which were in line with the measured et 430 mm under dr and 552 mm under cds obtained by a water balance approach in a field study conducted at the same site in 1992 1994 tan et al 2002a b moreover our simulated annual et was also comparable with the simulated mean et value of 468 mm for tile drained sites in southern ontario ahmed et al 2007 though this value was believed to represent an underestimation for dr treatment the simulated partitions of rainfall to drainage runoff and et were 36 8 and 51 which is comparable to the equivalent values of 30 8 and 55 from 1992 to 1994 at the same site observed by tan et al 2002a b under cds treatment 20 of the total annual water inputs precipitation plus subirrigation 1047 mm year 1 were partitioned into simulated subsurface drainage while 22 and 49 water inputs went to surface runoff and et 3 of water inputs contributed the increment of soil water storage for both dr and cds treatments which was lower than the observed value of 7 by tan et al 2002a b as shown in table 7 the annual precipitation over the whole study period was adequate to meet the crop water requirement under dr treatment and the soil water storage kept increasing each year the annual water supply of 67 mm from subirrigation resulted in 58 mm greater deep seepage while the crop transpiration was not increased our simulation suggested that the cds treatment resulted in greater surface runoff but less tile drainage than dr over the study period tan et al 2002a b also reported that cds treatment significantly reduced p 0 05 tile drainage and increased surface runoff than the dr treatment the total accumulated simulated drainage under the cds treatment was 41 less than that under the dr treatment which was lower than the site observed difference of 33 between two water table management by tan and zhang 2011 mean annual surface runoff from the cds treatment 231 mm was significantly higher 200 than that from the dr treatment 77 mm somewhat less than the 406 difference noted in tan and zhang 2011 3 4 crop growth statistical analysis of crop yield simulation for both calibration and validation under the dr and cds treatment suggested acceptable model performance with the pbias within 15 within the four years table 8 although tan and fulton 1980 reported irrigation to be necessary for the achievement of maximum crop productivity in the study region meanwhile some studies have shown experimental evidence that cds could improve crop yield than dr stampfli and madramootoo 2006 tan et al 1997 the current study indicated that both observed and simulated corn and soybean yields in the dr and cds treatments were similar the negligible impact of cds on crop yield during the whole study period may be explained by the sufficient rainfall for crop growth the mean annual precipitation in this study was 980 mm from 2008 to 2011 approximately 15 higher than the historical average precipitation from 1947 to 1996 853 mm year 1 furthermore our simulation did not demonstrate higher crop transpiration under the cds than the dr treatment according to tan et al 2002a b the et under cds treatment showed no difference when compared to the dr treatment during the wet year of 1992 because rainfall 968 mm was adequate for crop growth although the year of 2010 received relatively low annual precipitation 755 mm the total rainfall through the growing season from may to october 511 mm was higher than the historical average 474 mm consequently almost no difference in crop yield was observed between different water table management in the year of 2010 meanwhile the difference in predicted crop yield under dr and cds was minor suggesting little water stress in these two years generally the rz shaw model was able to predict the corn and soybean yield as affected by crop water demand under different water table management however it should be noted that some studies have reported lower crop yield under cds than dr due to waterlogging issues with too much rainfall in growing season madramootoo et al 2001 jiang et al 2018 while the model did not consider the waterlogging problem when simulating crop growth 4 summary and conclusions the main objective of this study was to test the subirrigation component of the hybrid rz shaw model for the first time in predicting surface runoff subsurface drainage and crop yield under dr and cds in a cold climate region in southern ontario the model performed generally well in simulating corn and soybean yield from 2008 to 2011 under both dr and cds treatments negligible difference in crop yield was found between different water table management while the simulation also showed no water stress and similar et under dr and cds suggesting that there was adequate rainfall for crop growth within the four years although the model prediction for drainage and runoff for cds system was not as accurate as dr system statistical analysis suggested that the rz shaw model performed satisfactorily in predicting subsurface tile drainage and surface runoff under both dr and cds treatment with pbias within 15 nse 0 50 and ioa 0 75 in addition the current model evaluation demonstrated that the hybrid rz shaw model had better capability than rzwqm2 for simulating hydrological processes in cold climates however further improvement is still needed as the subsurface tile drainage and surface runoff were slightly under estimated during the wintertime when the freeze thaw process complicates the hydrologic cycle additional data collection in the winter period such as snow depth melting and hydrologic conductivity as affected by frost may help to better test and improve the model declaration of competing

10601,recent studies have shown significant negative effects of long term irrigation with treated wastewater tww on performance of orchards planted on clay soil the aim of this study was to evaluate water use and water relations of different mitigation measures to remedy the declining performance of a mature commercial fruit bearing hass avocado orchard persea americana mill growing in a clay

trunk growth 1 introduction treated wastewater tww is in use in many water scarce areas where potable water is unavailable or costly recent reports have documented significant ill effects of long term irrigation 7 years with tww on physicochemical properties of clay soil assouline et al 2016 lado et al 2012 levy et al 2014 schacht and marschner 2015 and on orchard performance assouline and narkis 2013 paudel et al 2018 yalin et al 2017 the main documented detrimental effects on soil that affect orchard ecophysiological and agronomic responses are soil salinity and sodicity assouline et al 2016 poor aeration assouline and narkis 2013 and destruction of soil aggregates and structure mavi et al 2012 the destruction of aggregates reduces soil hydraulic conductivity that in turn reduces aeration and causes non uniform wetting insufficient water percolation and low leaching efficiency in the soil profile poor soil aeration reduces activity of microbial organisms engaged in the decomposition of organic material as well as root absorption of nutrients and water leading to reduced tree performance assouline and narkis 2013 moreover the salt introduced with tww coupled with the high evapotranspiration and salt exclusion by roots leads to an osmotic effect that directly affects the plant s ability to absorb water assouline et al 2015 if accumulated salts are not properly leached the plants are initially influenced by lack of water due to the osmotic effect of salinity crowley 2008 for instance a long term study in israel found 20 40 yield reduction of avocado and citrus orchards irrigated with tww for more than 10 years compared with fw irrigated orchards assouline and narkis 2013 tww caused a significant reduction of sap flow in citrus trees paudel et al 2017 2018 and root to stem hydraulic conductance in citrus trees both in field and lysimeter studies paudel et al 2016a compared with fw in clayey soil this indicates that irrigation of agricultural land with tww without maintaining adequate drainage for leaching of salinity is problematic pedrero et al 2010 even though variability between varieties exists avocado is in general a highly salinity sensitive fruit crop acosta rangel et al 2019 bernstein et al 2004 2001 carr 2013 celis et al 2018 the roots of avocado were found to be more sensitive than the shoots to salinity bernstein et al 2004 probably leading to reduction in water uptake and selectivity to ion uptake yalin et al 2017 therefore salinity management in avocado orchards requires using appropriate irrigation management practices that will provide sufficient water and minimize the accumulation of salts at least in the soil layer where the majority of roots are located crowley 2008 despite numerous management practices erel et al 2019 nicolás et al 2016 that have been suggested to overcome the negative impact of long term irrigation with tww on soil physicochemical properties and tree physiological and yield performance specific mitigation and or prevention measures have not been evaluated and recommended to support unrestricted irrigation with tww at first glance irrigation with fw is expected to improve physicochemical properties of soil already adversely affected by low quality irrigation water assouline and narkis 2011 graber and gerstl 2011 lado et al 2012 levy 2011 levy et al 2014 nadav et al 2013 pedrero et al 2010 schacht and marschner 2015 as well as root growth musyimi et al 2007 soda et al 2017 tree growth musyimi et al 2007 paudel et al 2016a and tree physiological performance musyimi et al 2007 paudel et al 2016a 2016b simpson et al 2015 compared with trees irrigated with poor quality water e g tww however the scarcity of fw in arid and semi arid areas make its use as a sole irrigation water source non feasible and or non economical therefore reliable water quality and soil remediating alternatives are required for sustainable use of poor quality water for irrigation alternatives suggested were mixing different quality water assouline et al 2016 kan and rapaport rom 2012 russo et al 2020 2015 tyagi 2003 leaching of accumulated salt via improving soil drainage and reducing evapotranspiration pitt and provin 2001 and irrigation scheduling oster et al 2007 so far the most common way to remove the salts accumulated in the rhizosphere is leaching with excess water to push the salts below the root zone crowley 2008 which is under debate due to its impact on environmental quality assouline et al 2015 as well as the high cost of water mixing water of different quality reduces the sodium adsorption ratio sar of the irrigation water and soil exchangeable sodium percentage esp assouline et al 2016 thus leading to improved soil structure plant growth and physiological response high volume low frequency irrigation is expected to enhance downward movement of salts and some toxic ions it is also expected to improve soil aeration that is negatively affected by long term irrigation with tww daily irrigation caused higher salinity accumulation in an avocado orchard compared with twice and once a week irrigation intervals oster et al 2007 in addition to the water quality amendments and irrigation scheduling tuff trench installation is another mitigation measure expected to improve soil aeration and drainage tuff has high porosity silber and raviv 1996 and high saturated hydraulic conductivity silber and raviv 1996 making it an excellent medium for leaching of solutes from the soil profile and reversing the limited hydraulic conductivity of a soil subjected to long term irrigation with tww it also creates better air circulation and water movement in the soil that may induce better root growth recently russo et al 2020 showed in a numerical study that trenches filled with highly coarse texture medium together with pulse irrigation improved water uptake by trees we know of no studies where all the above mentioned remediating treatments have been tested in one comprehensive study thereby allowing comparison under the same experimental conditions consequently the aim of this study was to evaluate different mitigation measures to remedy the declining performance of avocado orchards growing in clayey soils following long term irrigation with tww here we focus on tree sap flow and water relations the focus on tree water relations is based on previous reports which showed that it took at least 5 7 years to observe a decline in yield of trees due to irrigation with tww citrus paudel et al 2018 and avocado assouline et al 2015 while physiological effects were obtained in a very short time citrus paudel et al 2017 2016a 2016b and they are early indicators of the influence on yield citrus paudel et al 2018 yield and soil responses measured in the project will be reported elsewhere specifically we aim to answer the following questions 1 to what extent do water quality irrigation frequency and soil amendments change water uptake 2 do changes in water uptake correlate with changes in canopy conductance 3 are differences in tree water use related to changes in trunk growth rate an indicator of tree growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and treatment description the experiment is located in a mature commercial fruit bearing hass avocado orchard persea americana mill grafted on degania 117 rootstock at kibbutz yasur latitude 32 53 46 n and 35 10 22 e the western galilee israel the orchard was established in 2009 and has been irrigated with secondary tww from the nearby city

obtained by adding a third drip line to each row of trees and irrigation twice a week 3 irrigation with similar amounts of tww and fw 1 1 ratio mix due to health regulations the mix of the two water sources was obtained by irrigating with two drip lines side by side one pipe for each type of water on both sides of the tree rows 4 tuff trenches tuf 0 3 m deep and 0 3 m wide were dug about 0 3 m

mix lfi and tww control respectively eto declined steeply in october 2018 but daily water consumption declined much more gradually fig 3b the daily course of the ratio of sap flow of the various mitigation treatments relative to fw shows that the sap flow in tuf rises higher than fw in early morning and falls below fw shortly thereafter fig 6b and c tree transpiration relative to the reference evapotranspiration was consistently higher in fw when compared with all other treatments fig 4 a and b in 2017 relative transpiration was highest in fw 0 69 1 00 followed by tuf 0 57 0 94 fig 4a similarly the relative transpiration rate in 2018 was higher in fw mix and tuf as compared with tww in most of the irrigation season fig 4b the relative transpiration calculated by dividing the transpiration rate of each of the mitigation measures in 2018 by that for tww control in the 2017 irrigation season was continuously highest 1 04 1 65 fold in fw compared with tww 0 81 1 12 fold fig 5 3 2 canopy conductance and resistance the daytime half hourly canopy conductance gc determined using eq 7 increased sharply in early morning stabilized at about 9 00 am and gradually decreased in the afternoon in all mitigation measures fig 6a the early sharp increase and peak is related to the capacitance of the tree which causes the sap flow to lag behind the atmospheric water demand at about 9 00 am tww and lfi had lower gc than the other treatments later in the day fw gc was highest and tww control lowest fig 6a canopy resistance rc had a strong increasing linear relationship with vpd which was highest in tww followed by lfi fig 7 the regression analysis of rc and vpd is shown in table 2 3 3 plant hydraulic conductance whole plant hydraulic conductance determined from average whole tree sap flow between 12 00 and 14 00 and stem to leaf water potential gradient was significantly higher 0 60 kg m 2 s 1 mpa 1 in fw and tuf 0 56 kg m 2 s 1 mpa 1 p 0 05 fig 8 a compared with the tww treatment the hydraulic conductance partitioned between pathways from soil to leaf ksoil leaf root to stem kroot stem and stem to leaf kstem leaf is shown in fig 8b ksoil leaf was significantly higher in fw mix and tuf compared to tww p 0 05 fig 8b nevertheless kstem leaf was significantly higher in fw and tuf compared to tww control p 0 05 fig 8b 3 4 carbon isotope composition δ 13c the order of the differences in carbon isotope discrimination δ13c measured in 2017 fig 9 between mitigation measures appeared similar to other results but differences were not significant in 2018 we increased the sample size and for that year s results δ13c showed a highly significant decrease in fw 28 90 mix 28 23 and tuf 28 16 as compared with tww 26 97 p 0 05 fig 9 3 5 trunk growth the increment in tree trunk circumference was highest 16 0 in fw and lowest 13 8 in control tww fig 10 a there were no significant differences between mitigation measures in actual trunk growth however the trunk diameter increment was significantly higher in mix 2 56 cm and fw 2 53 cm compared with both tww 2 25 cm and tuf 2 26 cm p 0 05 fig 10b 4 discussions the general diurnal pattern of sap flow in trees of all treatments showed an increasing trend in the morning with increasing vpd radiation and et0 reaching maximum and steady state flow from 10 30 to 15 00 followed by a gradual decrease in the afternoon during both study years fig 2a and b the rise in sap flow rate lags behind radiation vpd and et0 by about 1 5 hs fig 2c there could be various reasons for this time gap between the rise of sap flow rate and climate variables first plants take some time to open stomata after sensing the radiation to reach full stomatal conductance secondly the plant capacitance refilled overnight is lost through transpiration before water from the soil reaches the upper tree crown goldstein et al 1998 a study conducted to understand functional convergence in hydraulic architecture and water relations of tropical savanna trees revealed a relatively large lag between increases in evaporative demand in the early morning and increases in sap flow rate suggesting that a substantial amount of water lost by transpiration is obtained initially from stem water storage bucci et al 2004 meinzer et al 2004 reported that about 10 of the daily water required by tropical trees is supplied from water stored in stems the gradual decline in sap flow rate in the afternoon is related to lower vpd radiation and evapotranspiration demand compared to midday goldstein et al 1998 suggested that sap flow should steadily decrease as refilling progresses in the afternoon the ratio of daytime diurnal dynamic sap flow of the various mitigation treatments relative to fw shows that the sap flow in tuf rises higher than fw in early morning and falls below fw shortly thereafter fig 6b and c this might indicate that either avocado trees are under water stress due to the higher water use in the morning or that enhanced infiltration beyond the root zone takes place this stress is evident in fig 6b and c as the relative sap flow in the afternoon is lower indicating insufficient refilling the early morning sap flow in mix relative to fw was higher in 2018 than in 2017 that might be an indication of the contribution of 50 fw in dilution of toxic ions and salt in the soil the dilution made by mixing tww with fw can reduce accumulation of salt sodium sar tss and other quality deteriorating factors which might reduce their negative effects and enhance the improvement of soil physicochemical properties leading to more availability of water to the plant roots the higher salinity sar and suspended and dissolved organic matter dom in tww are known to cause degradation of soil aggregate stability assouline and narkis 2013 schacht and marschner 2015 and hydraulic properties angin et al 2005 assouline and narkis 2011 schacht and marschner 2015 comparing differences between sap flow rate in the mitigation measures and the control indicates that the daily pattern of the sap flow was significantly higher in fw mix and tuf compared to tww fig 2b osmotic influences of salinity on soil water potential might be a reason for the reduction of tree transpiration rate in tww osmotic adjustment in the plant might alleviate this effect however we did not measure osmotic potential of the leaves so it is not clear whether and to what extent osmotic adjustment influenced tree response beyond the irrigation water salinity exclusion of salts by plant roots may also increase salinity and contribute to a change in soil and root osmotic potential gradient assouline et al 2015 the mean daily seasonal tree transpiration rate was significantly higher in fw during both irrigation seasons compared to tww fig 3 the improvement in tree water consumption in fw is in agreement with earlier studies conducted to evaluate the effect of long term irrigation with tww on grapefruit trees paudel et al 2018 the lower tree transpiration rate in tww can be related to the negative impact of long term irrigation with tww on soil salinity lado et al 2012 rosabal et al 2007 sar lado et al 2012 dissolved organic matter dom hamilton et al 2007 pedrero et al 2010 and esp assouline and narkis 2011 schacht and marschner 2015 the higher levels of dom sar and esp in tww irrigated soil can adversely affect soil structure aggregate stability hydraulic conductance and water repellency levy 2011 schacht et al 2014 tarchitzky et al 2007 the deterioration of soil aggregate stability and the increase in soil repellency to water may lead to the non uniform distribution of water in the rhizosphere under these heterogeneous conditions the total availability of water to the plant may be limited and reduce water uptake moreover the lower salinity in fw might have improved the osmotic potential gradient of the soil root junction compared with tww as shown in simulations of these treatments in our orchard russo et al 2020 trenches filled with tuff were used in this project because of the tuff s large particles result in larger pores which in turn should increase root aeration and leaching of salts as discussed in the introduction enhanced infiltration rate in tuf may enrich the root environment with oxygen after irrigation at a faster rate compared with tww control yalin et al 2017 suggested the low rhizosphere oxygen level could impair root functioning which may result in lower water uptake and decreased selectivity against na uptake by the roots according to yalin et al 2017 the reduced root activity and growth under low oxygen levels may result in reduced water uptake by roots leading to relatively higher water content in the soil that might further diminish the availability of oxygen under repeated irrigation however in the simulation by russo et al 2020 the main effect of the tuf treatment was the enhancement of salt leaching that reduced the negative salinity effect of the tww even though tree response to mix took longer than fw and tuf tree transpiration was significantly improved during some parts of 2017 fig 3a and most parts of 2018 fig 3b compared to tww the higher sap flow in mix relative to fw in 2018 compared with 2017 serves as evidence for the relatively longer time required for mix to improve tree water uptake this treatment is important for reducing the concentration of toxic ions and sar content of the irrigation water which in turn reduce soil esp leading to improved soil structure plant growth and physiological response sap flow improvements in lfi might arise from the high volume of the low frequency irrigation events that improve leaching of salts and toxic ions from the rooting zone lfi also may improve the aeration of the soil negatively affected by long term irrigation with tww due to the longer time between irrigation intervals which allows efficient drainage for instance daily irrigation caused the highest salinity accumulation in the soil solution compared with twice and once a week irrigation intervals in an avocado orchard oster et al 2007 paranychianakis et al 2004 found severe grapevine growth inhibition from one season to the next under higher irrigation levels using recycled water in this study we found lower whole plant hydraulic conductance and transpiration in tww compared to the mitigation measures studied fig 8a the reduction in hydraulic conductance in tww could mainly caused by the salinity and osmotic pressure in the soil solution vysotskaya et al 2010 proposed that down regulation of aquaporin gene expression in saline environments induces a reduction in root hydraulic conductance that in turn might lead to stomatal closure and lower transpiration in maize moreover partitioning of hydraulic conductance fig 8b showed that hydraulic conductance from stem to leaf was lower than that from soil to stem and that for tww conductance was significantly lower than for the other treatments leaf hydraulic resistance the inverse of hydraulic conductance changes with time of the day water supply leaf age and other factors yet it accounts for most of the hydraulic resistance in a shoot and contributes a substantial part of the whole plant hydraulic resistance sack and holbrook 2006 a regression analysis of the whole plant hydraulic conductance kp and rc in our study shows that there is strong and negative relation between kp and the slope of rc as a function of vpd fig 11 this finding is in agreement with bucci et al 2004 who reported a strong association between in vitro determined leaf specific hydraulic conductivity and in vivo estimated soil to leaf hydraulic conductance the δ13c analysis is a good indicator of long term integrated water use efficiency wue this analysis revealed that the bulk leaf tissue δ13c was gradually changing in the mitigation measures and that it was significantly lower in fw mix and tuf by an order of magnitude compared with tww in 2018 fig 9 this difference in δ13c of bulk leaf tissue in tww relative to the mitigation measures suggests that the tww treatment had relatively higher intrinsic water use efficiency indicative of reduced stomatal conductance similar effects of water salinity on δ13c of bulk leaf tissue in hass avocado scions grafted on different rootstocks were shown by acosta rangel et al 2019 where they also reported that the wue was lower under the higher salinity treatment the reduction of stomatal conductance causes a reduction of co2 concentration at the site of carboxylation forcing rubisco to assimilate more 13co2 acosta rangel et al 2019 cao et al 2012 found that the negative correlation between the ratio of intercellular co2 to ambient co2 concentrations ci ca and δ13c implies that a higher leaf δ13c corresponds to a lower ci ca ratio which most likely results from either higher demand for co2 during carbon assimilation or lower stomatal conductance limiting the co2 supply when there is limited transport of water carrying valuable assimilates or nutrients the plant s performance may be limited due to poor cell development leading to slower tree growth in this study we found highest not significant stem circumference change δ in fw 15 98 followed by mix 15 77 and lowest in tww 13 76 fig 10a similarly the change in diameter determined based on circumference measurement revealed that the change in stem diameter was significantly higher in fw 2 53 cm and mix 5 60 cm when compared with tww 2 25 cm and tuf 2 26 cm p 0 05 the lower trunk growth in tww could be ascribed to insufficient transport of water carrying valuable assimilates or nutrients to different organs of the plant to perform physiological and developmental processes the relatively slower trunk growth in tuf might be due to the loss or injury of the roots during tuff trench installation on june 2016 5 conclusions this study evaluated in the same orchard the effects of four mitigation measures on avocado tree performance following long term irrigation with tww improvements were found in tree water relations hydraulic conductance and tree growth in mitigation measures compared with the control tww the results imply that the tested mitigation measures are capable of reducing ill effects of long term irrigation with tww on avocado tree water uptake and other physiological processes different measured and calculated data harmoniously showed that fw improved tree water relations in addition to fw two of the other mitigation measures tuf and mix also contributed to the significant increase in sap flow compared to tww this improvement in sap flow was associated with increased tree hydraulic conductance canopy conductance and improved soil physicochemical properties our different methods of investigating tree water relations have shown synergy between results from the different methods used to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures on tree water status the treatment rankings from best to worst based on sap flow f canopy conductance gc and whole plant hydraulic conductance kp are fw tuf mix lfi tww based on our results both tuf and mix can be good candidates for remediating treatments to enhance sustainable use of treated wastewater for orchard irrigation in countries like israel where mixing of fw and tww is prohibited tuff trenches may be a good remediation alternative for sustainable use of tww for irrigation however continued investigation is required to confirm if the mitigation measures lead to sustained improved

10601,recent studies have shown significant negative effects of long term irrigation with treated wastewater tww on performance of orchards planted on clay soil the aim of this study was to evaluate water use and water relations of different mitigation measures to remedy the declining performance of a mature commercial fruit bearing hass avocado orchard persea americana mill growing in a clay soil irrigated with tww since 2009 the mitigation measures each in 6 replicates included freshwater fw blended tww fw in a 1 1 ratio mix low frequency tww irrigation lfi tww irrigated tuff trenches tuf and tww as the control treatment the penman monteith equation was used to determine reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and canopy conductance mm s 1 a variety of climatic variables and tree

trunk growth 1 introduction treated wastewater tww is in use in many water scarce areas where potable water is unavailable or costly recent reports have documented significant ill effects of long term irrigation 7 years with tww on physicochemical properties of clay soil assouline et al 2016 lado et al 2012 levy et al 2014 schacht and marschner 2015 and on orchard performance assouline and narkis 2013 paudel et al 2018 yalin et al 2017 the main documented detrimental effects on soil that affect orchard ecophysiological and agronomic responses are soil salinity and sodicity assouline et al 2016 poor aeration assouline and narkis 2013 and destruction of soil aggregates and structure mavi et al 2012 the destruction of aggregates reduces soil hydraulic conductivity that in turn reduces aeration and causes non uniform wetting insufficient water percolation and low leaching efficiency in the soil profile poor soil aeration reduces activity of microbial organisms engaged in the decomposition of organic material as well as root absorption of nutrients and water leading to reduced tree performance assouline and narkis 2013 moreover the salt introduced with tww coupled with the high evapotranspiration and salt exclusion by roots leads to an osmotic effect that directly affects the plant s ability to absorb water assouline et al 2015 if accumulated salts are not properly leached the plants are initially influenced by lack of water due to the osmotic effect of salinity crowley 2008 for instance a long term study in israel found 20 40 yield reduction of avocado and citrus orchards irrigated with tww for more than 10 years compared with fw irrigated orchards assouline and narkis 2013 tww caused a significant reduction of sap flow in citrus trees paudel et al 2017 2018 and root to stem hydraulic conductance in citrus trees both in field and lysimeter studies paudel et al 2016a compared with fw in clayey soil this indicates that irrigation of agricultural land with tww without maintaining adequate drainage for leaching of salinity is problematic pedrero et al 2010 even though variability between varieties exists avocado is in general a highly salinity sensitive fruit crop acosta rangel et al 2019 bernstein et al 2004 2001 carr 2013 celis et al 2018 the roots of avocado were found to be more sensitive than the shoots to salinity bernstein et al 2004 probably leading to reduction in water uptake and selectivity to ion uptake yalin et al 2017 therefore salinity management in avocado orchards requires using appropriate irrigation management practices that will provide sufficient water and minimize the accumulation of salts at least in the soil layer where the majority of roots are located crowley 2008 despite numerous management practices erel et al 2019 nicolás et al 2016 that have been suggested to overcome the negative impact of long term irrigation with tww on soil physicochemical properties and tree physiological and yield performance specific mitigation and or prevention measures have not been evaluated and recommended to support unrestricted irrigation with tww at first glance irrigation with fw is expected to improve physicochemical properties of soil already adversely affected by low quality irrigation water assouline and narkis 2011 graber and gerstl 2011 lado et al 2012 levy 2011 levy et al 2014 nadav et al 2013 pedrero et al 2010 schacht and marschner 2015 as well as root growth musyimi et al 2007 soda et al 2017 tree growth musyimi et al 2007 paudel et al 2016a and tree physiological performance musyimi et al 2007 paudel et al 2016a 2016b simpson et al 2015 compared with trees irrigated with poor quality water e g tww however the scarcity of fw in arid and semi arid areas make its use as a sole irrigation water source non feasible and or non economical therefore reliable water quality and soil remediating alternatives are required for sustainable use of poor quality water for irrigation alternatives suggested were mixing different quality water assouline et al 2016 kan and rapaport rom 2012 russo et al 2020 2015 tyagi 2003 leaching of accumulated salt via improving soil drainage and reducing evapotranspiration pitt and provin 2001 and irrigation scheduling oster et al 2007 so far the most common way to remove the salts accumulated in the rhizosphere is leaching with excess water to push the salts below the root zone crowley 2008 which is under debate due to its impact on environmental quality assouline et al 2015 as well as the high cost of water mixing water of different quality reduces the sodium adsorption ratio sar of the irrigation water and soil exchangeable sodium percentage esp assouline et al 2016 thus leading to improved soil structure plant growth and physiological response high volume low frequency irrigation is expected to enhance downward movement of salts and some toxic ions it is also expected to improve soil aeration that is negatively affected by long term irrigation with tww daily irrigation caused higher salinity accumulation in an avocado orchard compared with twice and once a week irrigation intervals oster et al 2007 in addition to the water quality amendments and irrigation scheduling tuff trench installation is another mitigation measure expected to improve soil aeration and drainage tuff has high porosity silber and raviv 1996 and high saturated hydraulic conductivity silber and raviv 1996 making it an excellent medium for leaching of solutes from the soil profile and reversing the limited hydraulic conductivity of a soil subjected to long term irrigation with tww it also creates better air circulation and water movement in the soil that may induce better root growth recently russo et al 2020 showed in a numerical study that trenches filled with highly coarse texture medium together with pulse irrigation improved water uptake by trees we know of no studies where all the above mentioned remediating treatments have been tested in one comprehensive study thereby allowing comparison under the same experimental conditions consequently the aim of this study was to evaluate different mitigation measures to remedy the declining performance of avocado orchards growing in clayey soils following long term irrigation with tww here we focus on tree sap flow and water relations the focus on tree water relations is based on previous reports which showed that it took at least 5 7 years to observe a decline in yield of trees due to irrigation with tww citrus paudel et al 2018 and avocado assouline et al 2015 while physiological effects were obtained in a very short time citrus paudel et al 2017 2016a 2016b and they are early indicators of the influence on yield citrus paudel et al 2018 yield and soil responses measured in the project will be reported elsewhere specifically we aim to answer the following questions 1 to what extent do water quality irrigation frequency and soil amendments change water uptake 2 do changes in water uptake correlate with changes in canopy conductance 3 are differences in tree water use related to changes in trunk growth rate an indicator of tree growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and treatment description the experiment is located in a mature commercial fruit bearing hass avocado orchard persea americana mill grafted on degania 117 rootstock at kibbutz yasur latitude 32 53 46 n and 35 10 22 e the western galilee israel the orchard was established in 2009 and has been irrigated with secondary tww from the nearby city

in a complete randomized design crd the mitigating measures studied were as follows 1 irrigation with fresh water fw using 2 drip lines for each row of trees 2 low frequency irrigation with tww lfi obtained by adding a third drip line to each row of trees and irrigation twice a week 3 irrigation with similar amounts of tww and fw 1 1 ratio mix due to health regulations the mix of the two water sources was obtained by irrigating with two drip lines side by side one pipe for each type of water on both sides of the tree rows 4 tuff trenches tuf 0 3 m deep and 0 3 m wide were dug about 0 3 m away from the stem on both sides of the tree rows and filled with volcanic tuff the trenches were irrigated six times a week from may 2016 to july 2018 and since august 2018 ten times a day with tww using drip laterals laid above the tuff trenches 5 treated wastewater tww i e control irrigation using 2 drip lines for each row of trees about 0 3 m from each side of the stem tww fw and mix were

6 carbon isotope ratios carbon isotope ratio δ13c was measured on leaves collected at the end of each irrigation season samples were collected from the top southern side of the tree in order to examine tissues that had maximum stress collected leaf samples were dried in an oven at 65 c for at least 48 h finely ground and tested for δ13c and c content as described by winter et al 1976 one mg

was marked on the bark using nails on the western and eastern side of the trunk stem circumference was measured at the same place in october 2017 and june 2019 the change in stem diameter was calculated from the circumference by assuming the tree trunk is a circle 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed with jmp pro statistical software version 14 0 0 sas institute inc usa diurnal and seasonal changes in sap flow hydraulic conductance carbon isotope discrimination and trunk diameter were subjected to analysis of variance anova using the jmp software sas institute inc usa means were compared using the tukey s hsd honestly significant difference test where different letters indicate significant difference differences between treatments were considered significant when the probability p was less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 sap flow the diurnal course of sap flow l h 1 tree 1 showed a typical asymmetrical bell shaped curve for all mitigation measures studied with a steep rise during the morning until about 9 am then a decreasing rise reaching maximum flow rate at about midday followed by a mild decrease and then a more steep decrease until late in the afternoon fig 2 there were significant differences in water consumption between treatments in both seasons the mean diurnal course of sap flow between 9 30 and 15 30 was significantly higher in fw followed by tuf compared with tww control throughout the 2018 irrigation season p 0 05 fig 2b daily total sap flow in mix was significantly higher than tww control during most of the 2018 study period p 0 05 fig 3 b the mean daily transpiration e of avocado trees measured with thermal dissipation sap flow sensors in 2017 and 2018 together with the reference evapotranspiration et0 are shown in fig 3a and b respectively in both seasons there were significant differences in water consumption between mitigation measures evaluated fig 3a and b sap flow in 2017 was significantly higher in fw compared with tww control in most of the irrigation season p 0 05 fig 3a the peak values of daily water consumption in the 2018 irrigation season were 5 39 4 94 4 66 4 15 and 3 46 mm day 1 in fw tuf mix lfi and tww control respectively eto declined steeply in october 2018 but daily water consumption declined much more gradually fig 3b the daily course of the ratio of sap flow of the various mitigation treatments relative to fw shows that the sap flow in tuf rises higher than fw in early morning and falls below fw shortly thereafter fig 6b and c tree transpiration relative to the reference evapotranspiration was consistently higher in fw when compared with all other treatments fig 4 a and b in 2017 relative transpiration was highest in fw 0 69 1 00 followed by tuf 0 57 0 94 fig 4a similarly the relative transpiration rate in 2018 was higher in fw mix and tuf as compared with tww in most of the irrigation season fig 4b the relative transpiration calculated by dividing the transpiration rate of each of the mitigation measures in 2018 by that for tww control in the 2017 irrigation season was continuously highest 1 04 1 65 fold in fw compared with tww 0 81 1 12 fold fig 5 3 2 canopy conductance and resistance the daytime half hourly canopy conductance gc determined using eq 7 increased sharply in early morning stabilized at about 9 00 am and gradually decreased in the afternoon in all mitigation measures fig 6a the early sharp increase and peak is related to the capacitance of the tree which causes the sap flow to lag behind the atmospheric water demand at about 9 00 am tww and lfi had lower gc than the other treatments later in the day fw gc was highest and tww control lowest fig 6a canopy resistance rc had a strong increasing linear relationship with vpd which was highest in tww followed by lfi fig 7 the regression analysis of rc and vpd is shown in table 2 3 3 plant hydraulic conductance whole plant hydraulic conductance determined from average whole tree sap flow between 12 00 and 14 00 and stem to leaf water potential gradient was significantly higher 0 60 kg m 2 s 1 mpa 1 in fw and tuf 0 56 kg m 2 s 1 mpa 1 p 0 05 fig 8 a compared with the tww treatment the hydraulic conductance partitioned between pathways from soil to leaf ksoil leaf root to stem kroot stem and stem to leaf kstem leaf is shown in fig 8b ksoil leaf was significantly higher in fw mix and tuf compared to tww p 0 05 fig 8b nevertheless kstem leaf was significantly higher in fw and tuf compared to tww control p 0 05 fig 8b 3 4 carbon isotope composition δ 13c the order of the differences in carbon isotope discrimination δ13c measured in 2017 fig 9 between mitigation measures appeared similar to other results but differences were not significant in 2018 we increased the sample size and for that year s results δ13c showed a highly significant decrease in fw 28 90 mix 28 23 and tuf 28 16 as compared with tww 26 97 p 0 05 fig 9 3 5 trunk growth the increment in tree trunk circumference was highest 16 0 in fw and lowest 13 8 in control tww fig 10 a there were no significant differences between mitigation measures in actual trunk growth however the trunk diameter increment was significantly higher in mix 2 56 cm and fw 2 53 cm compared with both tww 2 25 cm and tuf 2 26 cm p 0 05 fig 10b 4 discussions the general diurnal pattern of sap flow in trees of all treatments showed an increasing trend in the morning with increasing vpd radiation and et0 reaching maximum and steady state flow from 10 30 to 15 00 followed by a gradual decrease in the afternoon during both study years fig 2a and b the rise in sap flow rate lags behind radiation vpd and et0 by about 1 5 hs fig 2c there could be various reasons for this time gap between the rise of sap flow rate and climate variables first plants take some time to open stomata after sensing the radiation to reach full stomatal conductance secondly the plant capacitance refilled overnight is lost through transpiration before water from the soil reaches the upper tree crown goldstein et al 1998 a study conducted to understand functional convergence in hydraulic architecture and water relations of tropical savanna trees revealed a relatively large lag between increases in evaporative demand in the early morning and increases in sap flow rate suggesting that a substantial amount of water lost by transpiration is obtained initially from stem water storage bucci et al 2004 meinzer et al 2004 reported that about 10 of the daily water required by tropical trees is supplied from water stored in stems the gradual decline in sap flow rate in the afternoon is related to lower vpd radiation and evapotranspiration demand compared to midday goldstein et al 1998 suggested that sap flow should steadily decrease as refilling progresses in the afternoon the ratio of daytime diurnal dynamic sap flow of the various mitigation treatments relative to fw shows that the sap flow in tuf rises higher than fw in early morning and falls below fw shortly thereafter fig 6b and c this might indicate that either avocado trees are under water stress due to the higher water use in the morning or that enhanced infiltration beyond the root zone takes place this stress is evident in fig 6b and c as the relative sap flow in the afternoon is lower indicating insufficient refilling the early morning sap flow in mix relative to fw was higher in 2018 than in 2017 that might be an indication of the contribution of 50 fw in dilution of toxic ions and salt in the soil the dilution made by mixing tww with fw can reduce accumulation of salt sodium sar tss and other quality deteriorating factors which might reduce their negative effects and enhance the improvement of soil physicochemical properties leading to more availability of water to the plant roots the higher salinity sar and suspended and dissolved organic matter dom in tww are known to cause degradation of soil aggregate stability assouline and narkis 2013 schacht and marschner 2015 and hydraulic properties angin et al 2005 assouline and narkis 2011 schacht and marschner 2015 comparing differences between sap flow rate in the mitigation measures and the control indicates that the daily pattern of the sap flow was significantly higher in fw mix and tuf compared to tww fig 2b osmotic influences of salinity on soil water potential might be a reason for the reduction of tree transpiration rate in tww osmotic adjustment in the plant might alleviate this effect however we did not measure osmotic potential of the leaves so it is not clear whether and to what extent osmotic adjustment influenced tree response beyond the irrigation water salinity exclusion of salts by plant roots may also increase salinity and contribute to a change in soil and root osmotic potential gradient assouline et al 2015 the mean daily seasonal tree transpiration rate was significantly higher in fw during both irrigation seasons compared to tww fig 3 the improvement in tree water consumption in fw is in agreement with earlier studies conducted to evaluate the effect of long term irrigation with tww on grapefruit trees paudel et al 2018 the lower tree transpiration rate in tww can be related to the negative impact of long term irrigation with tww on soil salinity lado et al 2012 rosabal et al 2007 sar lado et al 2012 dissolved organic matter dom hamilton et al 2007 pedrero et al 2010 and esp assouline and narkis 2011 schacht and marschner 2015 the higher levels of dom sar and esp in tww irrigated soil can adversely affect soil structure aggregate stability hydraulic conductance and water repellency levy 2011 schacht et al 2014 tarchitzky et al 2007 the deterioration of soil aggregate stability and the increase in soil repellency to water may lead to the non uniform distribution of water in the rhizosphere under these heterogeneous conditions the total availability of water to the plant may be limited and reduce water uptake moreover the lower salinity in fw might have improved the osmotic potential gradient of the soil root junction compared with tww as shown in simulations of these treatments in our orchard russo et al 2020 trenches filled with tuff were used in this project because of the tuff s large particles result in larger pores which in turn should increase root aeration and leaching of salts as discussed in the introduction enhanced infiltration rate in tuf may enrich the root environment with oxygen after irrigation at a faster rate compared with tww control yalin et al 2017 suggested the low rhizosphere oxygen level could impair root functioning which may result in lower water uptake and decreased selectivity against na uptake by the roots according to yalin et al 2017 the reduced root activity and growth under low oxygen levels may result in reduced water uptake by roots leading to relatively higher water content in the soil that might further diminish the availability of oxygen under repeated irrigation however in the simulation by russo et al 2020 the main effect of the tuf treatment was the enhancement of salt leaching that reduced the negative salinity effect of the tww even though tree response to mix took longer than fw and tuf tree transpiration was significantly improved during some parts of 2017 fig 3a and most parts of 2018 fig 3b compared to tww the higher sap flow in mix relative to fw in 2018 compared with 2017 serves as evidence for the relatively longer time required for mix to improve tree water uptake this treatment is important for reducing the concentration of toxic ions and sar content of the irrigation water which in turn reduce soil esp leading to improved soil structure plant growth and physiological response sap flow improvements in lfi might arise from the high volume of the low frequency irrigation events that improve leaching of salts and toxic ions from the rooting zone lfi also may improve the aeration of the soil negatively affected by long term irrigation with tww due to the longer time between irrigation intervals which allows efficient drainage for instance daily irrigation caused the highest salinity accumulation in the soil solution compared with twice and once a week irrigation intervals in an avocado orchard oster et al 2007 paranychianakis et al 2004 found severe grapevine growth inhibition from one season to the next under higher irrigation levels using recycled water in this study we found lower whole plant hydraulic conductance and transpiration in tww compared to the mitigation measures studied fig 8a the reduction in hydraulic conductance in tww could mainly caused by the salinity and osmotic pressure in the soil solution vysotskaya et al 2010 proposed that down regulation of aquaporin gene expression in saline environments induces a reduction in root hydraulic conductance that in turn might lead to stomatal closure and lower transpiration in maize moreover partitioning of hydraulic conductance fig 8b showed that hydraulic conductance from stem to leaf was lower than that from soil to stem and that for tww conductance was significantly lower than for the other treatments leaf hydraulic resistance the inverse of hydraulic conductance changes with time of the day water supply leaf age and other factors yet it accounts for most of the hydraulic resistance in a shoot and contributes a substantial part of the whole plant hydraulic resistance sack and holbrook 2006 a regression analysis of the whole plant hydraulic conductance kp and rc in our study shows that there is strong and negative relation between kp and the slope of rc as a function of vpd fig 11 this finding is in agreement with bucci et al 2004 who reported a strong association between in vitro determined leaf specific hydraulic conductivity and in vivo estimated soil to leaf hydraulic conductance the δ13c analysis is a good indicator of long term integrated water use efficiency wue this analysis revealed that the bulk leaf tissue δ13c was gradually changing in the mitigation measures and that it was significantly lower in fw mix and tuf by an order of magnitude compared with tww in 2018 fig 9 this difference in δ13c of bulk leaf tissue in tww relative to the mitigation measures suggests that the tww treatment had relatively higher intrinsic water use efficiency indicative of reduced stomatal conductance similar effects of water salinity on δ13c of bulk leaf tissue in hass avocado scions grafted on different rootstocks were shown by acosta rangel et al 2019 where they also reported that the wue was lower under the higher salinity treatment the reduction of stomatal conductance causes a reduction of co2 concentration at the site of carboxylation forcing rubisco to assimilate more 13co2 acosta rangel et al 2019 cao et al 2012 found that the negative correlation between the ratio of intercellular co2 to ambient co2 concentrations ci ca and δ13c implies that a higher leaf δ13c corresponds to a lower ci ca ratio which most likely results from either higher demand for co2 during carbon assimilation or lower stomatal conductance limiting the co2 supply when there is limited transport of water carrying valuable assimilates or nutrients the plant s performance may be limited due to poor cell development leading to slower tree growth in this study we found highest not significant stem circumference change δ in fw 15 98 followed by mix 15 77 and lowest in tww 13 76 fig 10a similarly the change in diameter determined based on circumference measurement revealed that the change in stem diameter was significantly higher in fw 2 53 cm and mix 5 60 cm when compared with tww 2 25 cm and tuf 2 26 cm p 0 05 the lower trunk growth in tww could be ascribed to insufficient transport of water carrying valuable assimilates or nutrients to different organs of the plant to perform physiological and developmental processes the relatively slower trunk growth in tuf might be due to the loss or injury of the roots during tuff trench installation on june 2016 5 conclusions this study evaluated in the same orchard the effects of four mitigation measures on avocado tree performance following long term irrigation with tww improvements were found in tree water relations hydraulic conductance and tree growth in mitigation measures compared with the control tww the results imply that the tested mitigation measures are capable of reducing ill effects of long term irrigation with tww on avocado tree water uptake and other physiological processes different measured and calculated data harmoniously showed that fw improved tree water relations in addition to fw two of the other mitigation measures tuf and mix also contributed to the significant increase in sap flow compared to tww this improvement in sap flow was associated with increased tree hydraulic conductance canopy conductance and improved soil physicochemical properties our different methods of investigating tree water relations have shown synergy between results from the different methods used to evaluate the effect of mitigation measures on tree water status the treatment rankings from best to worst based on sap flow f canopy conductance gc and whole plant hydraulic conductance kp are fw tuf mix lfi tww based on our results both tuf and mix can be good candidates for remediating treatments to enhance sustainable use of treated wastewater for orchard irrigation in countries like israel where mixing of fw and tww is prohibited tuff trenches may be a good remediation alternative for sustainable use of tww for irrigation however continued investigation is required to confirm if the mitigation measures lead to sustained improved

socio economic issues soils are a cornerstone of our biophysical system that is vital to reach the sustainable development goals keesstra et al 2016 keesstraa et al 2019 a robust soil water system is essential for achieving most of these sustainable development goals sdgs adopted by the united nations griggs et al 2013 in tunisia oleiculture represents one of the principal economical and agricultural strategic sectors in fact about 80 million olive trees are spread over 1 8 million hectares onh 2017 the main olive cultivar is chemlali grown in semiarid and arid areas in central and southern tunisia and contributes to 80 of tunisia s oil production onh 2017 the area devoted to organic olive orchards has increased from 60 000 ha in 2004 to approximately 180 000 hectares in 2017 the organic farming system represents an economic opportunity for large rural areas in the center and south of tunisia which are generally unproductive offering a product of different quality which has been more and more demanded in the world fao 2012 however oil yield in these organic olive orchards still until now very low due especially to the soil erosion organic matter degradation and severe summer drought gargouri et al 2012 ben ahmed et al 2007 chehab et al 2017 soils of organic olive grove are typically mediterranean and very poor in organic matter nieto et al 2010 gucci et al 2012 in organic olive orchards the use of conventional fertilizers is restricted therefore the nutrition of the plants is a significant problem rodrigues et al 2006 thus alternative sources of nutrients are used in organic olive groves such as compost green manures cover crops and olive mill wastewater mechri et al 2011 magdich et al 2016 fernández hernández et al 2014 ordóñez fernández et al 2018 the effects of these different soil organic amendments on soil characteristics tree nutrient status vegetative activity and yield as well as on oil quality has been already well documented by several authors mechri et al 2009 chartzoulakis et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2013 nasini et al 2013 russo et al 2015 proietti et al 2015 aranda et al 2016 reckling et al 2016 regni et al 2017 chehab et al 2018 ordóñez fernández et al 2018 chehab et al 2019 among these soil organic amendments the use of olive mill wastewater omww as a soil amendment represents a serious problem because of its contribution to the soil salinization moraetis et al 2009 mekki et al 2013 the increased sodium toxicity in olive leaves as well as the accumulation of phenolic compounds in the soil jarboui et al 2008 ayoub et al 2014 mekki et al 2018 furthermore mechri et al 2011 and di bene et al 2013 found that agronomic application of olive mill wastewater significantly decreased the abundance and the biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and consequently the nutrient uptake of olive trees it has been found that an efficient natural solution for sustainable soil management verheijen et al 2009 in agricultural lands is the use of soil organic amendments and catch crops cerdà et al 2018 traditionally in tunisia olive trees have been cultivated under rain fed conditions but the use of limited amounts of irrigation water increased significantly the olive and oil yields lodolini et al 2014 however this country is facing more and more serious water deficiency problems particularly in arid and semi arid regions so large quantities of marginal water such as saline water are used for olive tree irrigation the most economic irrigation technique used for low density olive orchards is the complementary irrigation during the sensitive shoot and fruit growth as suggested by lavee et al 1990 lodolini et al 2014 and tekaya et al 2016a b olive is considered moderately tolerant to salinity fao 1985 its response to salinity stress is a cultivar dependent characteristic chartzoulakis 2005 bader et al 2015 kchaou et al 2013 many cultivars under semi arid and transient state salinity conditions can grow well with no significant yield reduction with an electrical conductivity ranging between 3 and 6 ms cm 1 aragüés et al 2005 kchaou et al 2010 salt tolerance is mainly associated to salt exclusion mechanisms operating in the roots preventing salt translocation rather than salt absorption gucci and tattini 1997 kchaou et al 2010 salinity affects photosynthesis shoot and fruit growth ben ahmed et al 2012 ghrab et al 2013 while the effects on fruit and oil yields depend on the salt concentration melgar et al 2007 wiesman et al 2004 ghrab et al 2013 in the last decades there is an increased research to find solutions to soil salinization when managing the saltwater resources flores et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2019 many methods are used for bioremediation of saline water and soil including the use of chemical agents and water leaching another important practice is the application of organic matter conditioner which would be a valuable approach that has been actualize worldwide being effective low cost and simple mbarki et al 2010 mbarki et al 2017 composts have been investigated for their effectiveness in soil remediation and plant yield improvement under saline conditions their utilization may promote nutrient availability and plant growth trivedi et al 2017 mbarki et al 2020 and stimulate respiration photosynthesis and chlorophyll content in plants lakhdar et al 2008 additionally regarding catch crop types recently chehab et al 2018 and cuevas et al 2019 reported that the use of legumes is very efficient to reduce the negative effects of salinity on plants however there are no studies on the interactive effects of complementary irrigation with saline water and different soil organic amendment practices on soil salinity and olive tree productivity under field conditions therefore the main aims of this experiment were to study the effects of the application of compost prepared with olive by products organic olive mill wastewater omww and legume cover crops combined with irrigation using saline water of 4 g l 1 on soil characteristics tree productivity and oil quality the study was conducted on an organic olive grove cv chemlali in tunisia

water 4 g l 1 and ni 18 olive trees grown under rain fed systems the different water irrigation treatments were kept well separated with a one tree edge to prevent water infiltration that might have confounded the water application regimes 2 3 climatic conditions water requirements and irrigation management twenty year records from a weather station of the jemmel regional station of meteorology were used to characterize the climate meteorological conditions over the study period were monitored using a weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk installed near the experimental site in the studied period precipitation recorded in 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons were 152 and 80 mm respectively potential evapotranspiration et0 recorded in 2016 and 2017 and calculated according to the penman monteith equation were 1280 mm and 1295 mm respectively fig 1 the total water requirement for olive tree under jemmel climatic conditions was estimated by standard methods based on 20 years 1995 2015 of weather data the calculation of the monthly reference evapotranspiration was carried out according to penneman monteith equation crop evapotranspiration was calculated according to the

the soil water content swc was determined monthly by a gravimetric method samples were taken under canopy at 2 5 m from the trunk using a soil auger up to 0 3 m in depth in which the highest active roots densities were reported three replications were taken per treatment during the irrigation application from may to august in the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons fresh samples were taken and

following the methodology described by murphy and riley 1962 2 5 3 growth and olive yield measurements before the beginning of the 2016 cropping season six olive trees per treatment were selected and for each tree six 1 year old mixed shoots total of 36 shoots per treatment around the canopy at 1 5 m 1 8 m from the ground were labeled the shoot length was measured in december of the 2017 cropping season just before harvest at the first week of december of 2017 cropping season 100 fruits were sampled from around the canopy from three olive trees to measure the mean fruit weight once the pulp had been removed from each fruit the fresh and dry weights of the mesocarp epicarp and the endocarp were measured separately the total fruit production per tree was recorded at harvest and oil yield per fresh matter was calculated from the production of individual plants for six trees per plot 2 5 4 analytical method for olive and oil phenol contents total phenols in fruits were quantified calorimetrically 0 5 g of fresh olive fruits were extracted in 10 ml of methanol on a shaker at 200 rpm for 24 h after centrifugation 5000 g for 10 min all obtained extracts were then transferred to vials and kept in the dark at 20 c taamalli et al 2012 total phenolic content was determined according to the method of montedoro et al 1992 the absorbance was measured at 765 nm and total phenol concentration was expressed as mg kg 1 of hydroxytyrosol at harvest at mid december of the 2017 cropping season a sample of 3 kg of fruits was taken at random around each experimental tree and transported to the laboratory on the same day for oil extraction oil extraction was carried out in similar industrial extraction conditions using a bench hammer mill only healthy fruits without any kind of infection or physical damage were processed the extraction process consisted of the following steps fruit crushing malaxation for 30 min at 25 c and centrifugation in a two phase decanter 3500

contents of leaf na increased significantly with irrigation with saline water ir in all treatments except in the control plot the highest percentage increase was 35 for trees amended with omww while the lowest one was recorded for trees intercropped with legumes tl the statistical analysis revealed higher significant differences between the effects of soil organic amendments and saline irrigation with regard to leaf na contents however there was no significant interaction between the two studied factors with regard to na content in olive leaves under rain fed conditions ni the lowest n level was observed in tc 0 3 tp and omww tm treatments caused a significant increase of the leaf nitrogen content by about 20 fig 4b irrigation with saline water ir enhanced the accumulation of n in olive leaves the highest rate of n increase was reported in olive trees amended with omww by about 25 fig 4b statistical analysis showed higher significant interaction between soil organic amendments and irrigation on the leaf n content under rain fed conditions ni the lowest leaf p level was observed in the plot intercropped with legumes 0 55 while the highest one was observed in the plot amended with omww fig 4c the irrigation with saline water ir caused a significant decrease of the leaf p contents in tc tp and tm plots reaching values of 0 1 expect for olive trees intercropped with legumes where leaf p level remained unchanged 0 57 the statistical analysis showed that there was a low significant interaction between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on the leaf p content the leaf k level decreased significantly under rain fed conditions ni in the plots amended with omww and those intercropped by legumes by about 50 as compared with the control tc and tp plots fig 4d irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly the leaf k contents in tp 26 tm by 40 and tl by 55 plots fig4 d statistical analysis revealed that there were high significant differences and low interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on leaf k level 3 3 effects of soil organic amendments and complementary irrigation on growth and yield under rain fed conditions ni the use of compost tp and legumes as cover crops tl significantly improved the final shoot growth by about 50 and 45 in comparison with tc table 1 irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly the shoot growth the highest rate of increase was reported in tl treatment by about 60 the statistical analysis showed that there were high significant differences and significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on final shoot growth under rain fed conditions ni the highest mean fruit weight was about 0 53 g recorded in the plot amended with compost while it did not exceed 0 45 g in the other treatments and in control plot table 1 when studying the effects of irrigation with saline water ir the results showed a significant increase of the mean fruit weight in tc by 11 7 tp by 19 2 and tl by 27 5 the statistical analysis revealed that there were high significant differences and significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on mean fruit weight the use of soil organic amendments under rain fed conditions ni increased significantly the pulp stone ratio from 1 54 in the control plot to reach 2 03 1 87 and 2 1 in tp tm and tl respectively as a result of irrigation with saline water ir the pulp stone ratio increased significantly by about 39 9 41 34 10 83 and 13 77 in tc tp tm and tl plots respectively statistical analysis revealed that there were significant differences and significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on the pulp stone ratio table 1 only the use of omww tm under rain fed conditions ni decreased significantly the olive oil content in fresh matter to reach about 7 7 the irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly the olive oil content to reach 14 of fresh matter in tc and tp plots and 12 of fresh matter in tm and tl treatments table 1 the statistical analysis revealed that there were very significant differences and significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on the oil yield comparing to control we observed that soil organic amendments under rain fed conditions ni were effective to ameliorate significantly the oil yield by about 106 6 and 65 respectively in olive trees plots amended by compost tp by olive mill wastewater tm and those intercropped with legumes tl similarly complementary irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly oil yield from 132 to 273 8 kg ha 1 in tc from 269 to 553 kg ha 1 in tp from 140 to 304 kg ha 1 in tm and from 218 4 to 392 5 kg ha 1 in tl table 1 3 4 effects of soil organic amendments and complementary irrigation on fruit and oil phenol contents total phenols in olive fruit and olive oil were quantified at harvest and the effects of soil organic amendments ni and irrigation with saline water ir on these contents were investigated and shown in fig 5 a statistical analysis showed that there were very significant differences but no significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on the phenol content in fruits however phenol content in olive oil seems to be significantly affected only by the soil organic amendments under rain fed conditions ni the lowest values of phenol contents in fruits and oil were recorded in trees amended with compost tp on the other hand no differences on phenol contents in fruits and oil were found between trees of tc and plots amended with omww and those intercropped with legumes irrigation with saline water induced a significant decrease in the fruit phenol content in all treatments while phenol oil content was mainly affected in trees amended by compost and it remained unaffected by the use of omww and cover crops fig 5b 4 discussion the soil water content swc values measured at 30 cm soil depth seem to be low as affected mainly by the applied treatments and by the soil evaporation in the superficial layer swc levels were improved by the complementary irrigation as mentioned previously by many authors ben ahmed et al 2009 ghrab et al 2013 but among soil organic amendments only tp plot presented the highest swc value in a line with our results ramos and marttinez casasnovas 2006 suggested that composted cattle manure applied to the soils showed a positive effect improving infiltration and decreasing runoff volumes by up to 20 and were more influenced by the compost quantity applied adugna 2016 the complementary irrigation by saline water in combination with the different soil organic amendments significantly affected the soil electrical conductivity as shown in fig 3 the use of compost olive mill wastewater and legumes as cover crops modified differently the soil electrical conductivity in fact on all dates of measurements the high values of the sec observed in the plot amended with omww can be explained by the composition of this material which presented a high salinity level as well as a high content of phenolic compounds mekki et al 2013 this finding was supported by many authors after a short and long term application of omww in olive orchards magdich et al 2016 vella et al 2016 the soil electrical conductivity increased at a depth between 0 20 cm and was proportional to the supplied volume of olive mill wastewater as suggested by di serio et al 2008 sierra et al 2007 and mekki et al 2009 in our study the low values of the sec recorded in the soils of tp and tl were probably caused by the organic matter accumulation in the superficial soil layers semida et al 2014 and ouni et al 2014 found that soil electrical conductivity values tend to decrease probably due to the occurrence of the charged sites i e coo and account for the ability of humate to chelate and retain cation in non active forms in addition rady et al 2016 founded that the reduced electrical conductivity of the added organic matter contributed to the decrease of sec during the dry period of 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons the sec in the superficial soil layer of 30 cm depth increased as compared to the sec measurements at the wet period sec variability was due to the soil humidity which was influenced by the rainfall distribution and the soil evaporation fig1 in line with our results ben ahmed et al 2009 and ghrab et al 2013 showed that irrigation of olive trees with saline water increased the soil salinity which is not only dependent to water salinity levels but also to the soil texture and climatic conditions the significant decreased leaf na contents in the plots amended with compost olive mill wastewater and those intercropped with legumes were the results of the organic matter improvement as published by chehab et al 2019 in a previous work on the same olive orchard the addition of compost reduced significantly the accumulation of na in plant leaves and was related to the amount of compost added rady et al 2016 more recently mbarki et al 2020 reported that dried municipal solid waste compost and farmyard manure compensates the negative effects of salty water on plant growth and nutrient uptake the improvement of plant performance grown under high salinity levels using legume species as cover crops as observed in our study was well explained previously by bruning et al 2015 and chehab et al 2018 our results showed also that soil amendment with olive mill wastewater using saline water for irrigation increased the leaf na level to reach toxic values these findings can be explained by the mobilization of high na amounts stored in the soil of tm plot by means of the irrigation flow during the dry period the analyzed n and k contents in olive leaves at the end of the 2017 cropping season on year were lower than the critical n and k deficiency thresholds for olive trees as published by fernández escobar et al 2015 and de souza et al 2019 these findings can be explained by the high nutrient export during fruit production recorded on 2017 cropping season table 1 the rate of n annually exported for fruit production is about 8 g of n kg 1 rodrigues et al 2013 the increased leaf n and k levels as a result of irrigation with saline water was probably due to the increased water flow in irrigated trees which facilitates availability and nutrient uptake from the soil as suggested by erel et al 2018 who showed that nutrient uptake for olive trees is related to the applied irrigation doses nevertheless kasırğa and demiral 2016 found that irrigation of olive seedlings by high salinity water decreased the n and k concentrations in olive leaves compared to control plants irrigated by tap water except for olive trees intercropped with legumes we found a very high reduction of leaf p level in trees of tc tm and tp after irrigation with saline water in this context bhadha et al 2012 and baker et al 2013 mentioned that phosphate concentration in field grown agronomic crops as well as in the soil solution decreased as soil salinity increased more recently the effects of salts on phosphorus availability in alkaline tunisian soils were well studied and documented by beji et al 2017 regarding the high level of leaf p recorded in olive trees intercropped with legumes zhou et al 2017 reported that legume species increased the soil microbial community which decreased soil ph and increased the mineralization of organic p because phosphatase activity is higher in the rhizosphere of legumes the significant interactions between irrigation water salinity and soil organic amendments as well as the use of legumes as cover crops significantly increased shoot growth and oil yield the use of compost and legumes as cover crops reduced the negative effects of saline water on crop growth and oil yield by decreasing the accumulated sodium ions in olive leaves of tp and tl treatments as reported recently by chehab et al 2018 the increased water use by irrigation as well as by soil amendment materials organic matter water retaining substances increased the oil yield per hectare lodolini et al 2014 ghrab et al 2013 lodolini et al 2016 chehab et al 2017 chehab et al 2019 it has been found that the oil content per fresh matter was related to the crop load fruit weight fruit humidity as well as the maturity index iniesta et al 2009 chehab et al 2017 ghrab et al 2013 reported that the increase of irrigation amount decreased olive oil content per fruit fresh weight the presence of phenolic compounds in fruits and oil contributes to the nutritional value and sensory characteristics and has been of major interest to researchers due to their positive effects on both human health and the olive and oil itself servili et al 2004 tekaya et al 2013 tekaya et al 2016a b among the studied soil organic amendments only compost affected negatively the phenol contents in fruits and olive oil these findings were in contradiction with those reported by chehab et al 2019 in their previous work conducted in the same experimental orchard in 2015 cropping season and where they found highest contents of oil phenols in the plot amended with compost regni et al 2017 this phenomenon could be explained by the organic matter mineralization process and the high n availability to olive trees as well as the high soil water content in this plot tp the negative effects of n supply or high soil humidity on phenol concentration were also observed and explained in previous studies fernández escobar et al 2006 tekaya et al 2016a b the accumulation of polyphenols in fruits and oil produced from olive trees of tc and tm plots from which high leaf na levels and low swc values were reported suggested that the antioxidant machinery of olive trees functioned adequately increased total phenol contents have been also observed in olive trees subjected to various environmental stresses such as cold stress ortega garcía and peragón 2009 water deficit tekaya et al 2016a b chehab et al 2017 and salt stress ben ahmed et al 2009 and it was suggested that phenolics act as antioxidants petridis et al 2012 it has been reported that omww application caused similar effects to those of mild water deficit stress ouzounidou et al 2010 mechri et al 2011 the phenol accumulation in fruits and oil of olive trees intercropped with legumes could be due to the high level of phosphorus in olive leaves tekaya et al 2013 as well as the limited soil water availability occurred during fruit growth and oil accumulation in this plot tl the negative effects of irrigation on total phenol contents in fruits and oil observed in our study were also reported in previous works bedbabis et al 2015 tekaya et al 2016a b in fact irrigation affects negatively the activity of l phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal the key enzyme in phenolic biosynthesis thus decreasing phenolic levels being lowered as the supply of water increased lodolini et al 2014 5 conclusion in semiarid regions such as tunisia since soil of olive orchards are poor and fresh water resources are often scarce the use of soil organic amendments combined with a limited saline water irrigation has been shown to be an important element in typical organic olive orchards because of its potential benefits a significant interaction between complementary irrigation with saline water and soil organic amendments was observed affecting sodium accumulation in olive leaves and oil yield especially when using compost as amendment and legumes as cover crops the study indicated that compost in both rain fed and irrigated plots is an efficient amendment for soil water holding capacity reducing the negative effects of water salinity on soil and olive trees and it increased the shoot growth as well as the oil yield the use of legumes as cover crops seems to be the most efficient organic amendment in reducing the water salt effects on soils as well as on olive trees for which the lowest na and the highest p levels in olive leaves were observed olive mill wastewater is not appropriate for use in combination with saline water irrigation as it increased the soil electrical conductivity and accentuated the na accumulation in olive leaves to reach the salt toxic limits we observed also in the current study that the factor soil organic amendments revealed much more efficient in enhancing the oil phenol contents of olive trees than complementary irrigation with saline water taken together these findings are of greatest interest because we proved that for organic olive orchards grown under arid climate irrigation with saline water can be applied sustainably when combined with compost or legume cover crops with limited effects on soil salinity and olive tree performance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

socio economic issues soils are a cornerstone of our biophysical system that is vital to reach the sustainable development goals keesstra et al 2016 keesstraa et al 2019 a robust soil water system is essential for achieving most of these sustainable development goals sdgs adopted by the united nations griggs et al 2013 in tunisia oleiculture represents one of the principal economical and agricultural strategic sectors in fact about 80 million olive trees are spread over 1 8 million hectares onh 2017 the main olive cultivar is chemlali grown in semiarid and arid areas in central and southern tunisia and contributes to 80 of tunisia s oil production onh 2017 the area devoted to organic olive orchards has increased from 60 000 ha in 2004 to approximately 180 000 hectares in 2017 the organic farming system represents an economic opportunity for large rural areas in the center and south of tunisia which are generally unproductive offering a product of different quality which has been more and more demanded in the world fao 2012 however oil yield in these organic olive orchards still until now very low due especially to the soil erosion organic matter degradation and severe summer drought gargouri et al 2012 ben ahmed et al 2007 chehab et al 2017 soils of organic olive grove are typically mediterranean and very poor in organic matter nieto et al 2010 gucci et al 2012 in organic olive orchards the use of conventional fertilizers is restricted therefore the nutrition of the plants is a significant problem rodrigues et al 2006 thus alternative sources of nutrients are used in organic olive groves such as compost green manures cover crops and olive mill wastewater mechri et al 2011 magdich et al 2016 fernández hernández et al 2014 ordóñez fernández et al 2018 the effects of these different soil organic amendments on soil characteristics tree nutrient status vegetative activity and yield as well as on oil quality has been already well documented by several authors mechri et al 2009 chartzoulakis et al 2010 rodrigues et al 2013 nasini et al 2013 russo et al 2015 proietti et al 2015 aranda et al 2016 reckling et al 2016 regni et al 2017 chehab et al 2018 ordóñez fernández et al 2018 chehab et al 2019 among these soil organic amendments the use of olive mill wastewater omww as a soil amendment represents a serious problem because of its contribution to the soil salinization moraetis et al 2009 mekki et al 2013 the increased sodium toxicity in olive leaves as well as the accumulation of phenolic compounds in the soil jarboui et al 2008 ayoub et al 2014 mekki et al 2018 furthermore mechri et al 2011 and di bene et al 2013 found that agronomic application of olive mill wastewater significantly decreased the abundance and the biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and consequently the nutrient uptake of olive trees it has been found that an efficient natural solution for sustainable soil management verheijen et al 2009 in agricultural lands is the use of soil organic amendments and catch crops cerdà et al 2018 traditionally in tunisia olive trees have been cultivated under rain fed conditions but the use of limited amounts of irrigation water increased significantly the olive and oil yields lodolini et al 2014 however this country is facing more and more serious water deficiency problems particularly in arid and semi arid regions so large quantities of marginal water such as saline water are used for olive tree irrigation the most economic irrigation technique used for low density olive orchards is the complementary irrigation during the sensitive shoot and fruit growth as suggested by lavee et al 1990 lodolini et al 2014 and tekaya et al 2016a b olive is considered moderately tolerant to salinity fao 1985 its response to salinity stress is a cultivar dependent characteristic chartzoulakis 2005 bader et al 2015 kchaou et al 2013 many cultivars under semi arid and transient state salinity conditions can grow well with no significant yield reduction with an electrical conductivity ranging between 3 and 6 ms cm 1 aragüés et al 2005 kchaou et al 2010 salt tolerance is mainly associated to salt exclusion mechanisms operating in the roots preventing salt translocation rather than salt absorption gucci and tattini 1997 kchaou et al 2010 salinity affects photosynthesis shoot and fruit growth ben ahmed et al 2012 ghrab et al 2013 while the effects on fruit and oil yields depend on the salt concentration melgar et al 2007 wiesman et al 2004 ghrab et al 2013 in the last decades there is an increased research to find solutions to soil salinization when managing the saltwater resources flores et al 2017 chowdhury et al 2019 many methods are used for bioremediation of saline water and soil including the use of chemical agents and water leaching another important practice is the application of organic matter conditioner which would be a valuable approach that has been actualize worldwide being effective low cost and simple mbarki et al 2010 mbarki et al 2017 composts have been investigated for their effectiveness in soil remediation and plant yield improvement under saline conditions their utilization may promote nutrient availability and plant growth trivedi et al 2017 mbarki et al 2020 and stimulate respiration photosynthesis and chlorophyll content in plants lakhdar et al 2008 additionally regarding catch crop types recently chehab et al 2018 and cuevas et al 2019 reported that the use of legumes is very efficient to reduce the negative effects of salinity on plants however there are no studies on the interactive effects of complementary irrigation with saline water and different soil organic amendment practices on soil salinity and olive tree productivity under field conditions therefore the main aims of this experiment were to study the effects of the application of compost prepared with olive by products organic olive mill wastewater omww and legume cover crops combined with irrigation using saline water of 4 g l 1 on soil characteristics tree productivity and oil quality the study was conducted on an organic olive grove cv chemlali in tunisia

water 4 g l 1 and ni 18 olive trees grown under rain fed systems the different water irrigation treatments were kept well separated with a one tree edge to prevent water infiltration that might have confounded the water application regimes 2 3 climatic conditions water requirements and irrigation management twenty year records from a weather station of the jemmel regional station of meteorology were used to characterize the climate meteorological conditions over the study period were monitored using a weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk installed near the experimental site in the studied period precipitation recorded in 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons were 152 and 80 mm respectively potential evapotranspiration et0 recorded in 2016 and 2017 and calculated according to the penman monteith equation were 1280 mm and 1295 mm respectively fig 1 the total water requirement for olive tree under jemmel climatic conditions was estimated by standard methods based on 20 years 1995 2015 of weather data the calculation of the monthly reference evapotranspiration was carried out according to penneman monteith equation crop evapotranspiration was calculated according to the

production and olive mill wastewater characteristics fava bean vicia faba l seeds were sown manually in full field with an amount of 120 kg ha 1 the seeds were buried in november by a cultivator longitudinally and transversely during all the growing seasons cover crop mowing was carried out in march with cultivator the composting mixtures were prepared by mixing olive pomace with different organic materials used as bulking agents and n sources such as olive tree pruning and sheep manure all these agro industrial by products are produced locally either in the organic olive farm or in the surrounding area the compost was prepared using the same dry weight proportions of the following starting mixtures sheep manure 40 olive pomace 40 and by products of olive tree pruning 20 compost was prepared in a pilot plant using the turning pile system in trapezoidal piles 8 m length 1 5 m width on the base and 1 m height containing approximately 5000 kg in each pile the piles were turned every two weeks during the bio oxidative phase approximately from may to october temperature and moisture were used as monitoring parameters to follow the composting progress water was added during turning

the soil water content swc was determined monthly by a gravimetric method samples were taken under canopy at 2 5 m from the trunk using a soil auger up to 0 3 m in depth in which the highest active roots densities were reported three replications were taken per treatment during the irrigation application from may to august in the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons fresh samples were taken and weighed the same samples were then dried to a constant weight in a ventilated oven at 105 c the weight difference between the fresh and dried samples corresponds to the total water content swc was calculated using the following equation swc m 3 m 3 fw dw fw fw m3 and dw m3 are the fresh and dry weights of the soil sample respectively soil samples taken from tree root zone at 30 cm depth during the periods of mid july and mid october of the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons were also used to determine the soil electrical conductivity sec of the soil solution extracted from saturated paste on each plot three repetitions were taken to determine the soil electrical conductivity of the saturated paste according to rhoades 1996 sec was carried out from the preparation of a solution in which 15

following the methodology described by murphy and riley 1962 2 5 3 growth and olive yield measurements before the beginning of the 2016 cropping season six olive trees per treatment were selected and for each tree six 1 year old mixed shoots total of 36 shoots per treatment around the canopy at 1 5 m 1 8 m from the ground were labeled the shoot length was measured in december of the 2017 cropping season just before harvest at the first week of december of 2017 cropping season 100 fruits were sampled from around the canopy from three olive trees to measure the mean fruit weight once the pulp had been removed from each fruit the fresh and dry weights of the mesocarp epicarp and the endocarp were measured separately the total fruit production per tree was recorded at harvest and oil yield per fresh matter was calculated from the production of individual plants for six trees per plot 2 5 4 analytical method for olive and oil phenol contents total phenols in fruits were quantified calorimetrically 0 5 g of fresh olive fruits were extracted in 10 ml of methanol on a shaker at 200 rpm for 24 h after centrifugation 5000 g for 10 min all obtained extracts were then transferred to vials and kept in the dark at 20 c taamalli et al 2012 total phenolic content was determined according to the method of montedoro et al 1992 the absorbance was measured at 765 nm and total phenol concentration was expressed as mg kg 1 of hydroxytyrosol at harvest at mid december of the 2017 cropping season a sample of 3 kg of fruits was taken at random around each experimental tree and transported to the laboratory on the same day for oil extraction oil extraction was carried out in similar industrial extraction conditions using a bench hammer mill only healthy fruits without any kind of infection or physical damage were processed the extraction process consisted of the following steps fruit crushing malaxation for 30 min at 25 c and centrifugation in a two phase decanter 3500 rpm over 1 min oils were then decanted filtered transferred into amber glass bottles and stored in darkness the oil content of the olive fruit was determined by extracting fresh material olive oil

the absorption of the solution at 765 nm was measured values are given as mg of hydroxytyrosol per kilogram of oil 2 6 statistical analysis a two way analysis of variance anova was used to examine soil organic amendments and complementary irrigation with saline water effects on soil salinity agronomical and nutritional parameters of olive trees as well as phenol contents in fruits and oil using

2017 and in all soil organic amendments swc measured at 30 cm soil depth decreased progressively from may to reach minimum values in august fig 2 a the maximum values of swc were recorded in the soil amended with compost tp and varied between 0 06 and 0 04 m3 m 3 for the other treatments values of swc were significantly lower in tc tm and tl treatments varying between 0 04 and 0 02 m3 m 3 fig 2 a

swc values were recorded in tp plot varying between 0 09 and 0 12 m3 m 3 however in tc tm and tl irrigated plots swc were significantly lower compared to tp plot varying between 0 09 and 0 07 m3 m 3 fig 2 b soil electrical conductivity sec was measured at 30 soil depth on july and october of 2016 and 2017 and results were presented in fig 4 under rain fed conditions ni during all measurement dates of 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons the lowest sec values were recorded in the soil amended with compost tp and intercropped with legumes tl and values varied between 0 6 and 1 ms m 1 the highest sec values were recorded in the soil amended with omww tm varying between 0 8 and 1 4 ms m 1 the seasonal variation of the sec showed that it was significantly lower during autumn period october than that in the summer period july in both cropping seasons 2016 2017 complementary irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly the sec mainly during the summer period july with increased rates varying between 100 and 35 fig 3 a 3c 3 2 effects of soil organic amendments and complementary irrigation on leaf n p k and na contents leaf n p k and na were analyzed at the end of the 2017 cropping season on year and results were presented in fig 4 under rain fed conditions ni the leaf na contents was 0 68 in olive trees of the control plot tc it decreased significantly in plots amended with compost tp and omww tm to reach values of about 0 45 and 0 5 respectively in leaves of olive trees intercropped with legumes tl na level reached the lowest values by about 0 25 fig 4a the contents of leaf na increased significantly with irrigation with saline water ir in all treatments except in the control plot the highest percentage increase was 35 for trees amended with omww while the lowest one was recorded for trees intercropped with legumes tl the statistical analysis revealed higher significant differences between the effects of soil organic amendments and saline irrigation with regard to leaf na contents however there was no significant interaction between the two studied factors with regard to na content in olive leaves under rain fed conditions ni the lowest n level was observed in tc 0 3 tp and omww tm treatments caused a significant increase of the leaf nitrogen content by about 20 fig 4b irrigation with saline water ir enhanced the accumulation of n in olive leaves the highest rate of n increase was reported in olive trees amended with omww by about 25 fig 4b statistical analysis showed higher significant interaction between soil organic amendments and irrigation on the leaf n content under rain fed conditions ni the lowest leaf p level was observed in the plot intercropped with legumes 0 55 while the highest one was observed in the plot amended with omww fig 4c the irrigation with saline water ir caused a significant decrease of the leaf p contents in tc tp and tm plots reaching values of 0 1 expect for olive trees intercropped with legumes where leaf p level remained unchanged 0 57 the statistical analysis showed that there was a low significant interaction between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on the leaf p content the leaf k level decreased significantly under rain fed conditions ni in the plots amended with omww and those intercropped by legumes by about 50 as compared with the control tc and tp plots fig 4d irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly the leaf k contents in tp 26 tm by 40 and tl by 55 plots fig4 d statistical analysis revealed that there were high significant differences and low interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on leaf k level 3 3 effects of soil organic amendments and complementary irrigation on growth and yield under rain fed conditions ni the use of compost tp and legumes as cover crops tl significantly improved the final shoot growth by about 50 and 45 in comparison with tc table 1 irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly the shoot growth the highest rate of increase was reported in tl treatment by about 60 the statistical analysis showed that there were high significant differences and significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on final shoot growth under rain fed conditions ni the highest mean fruit weight was about 0 53 g recorded in the plot amended with compost while it did not exceed 0 45 g in the other treatments and in control plot table 1 when studying the effects of irrigation with saline water ir the results showed a significant increase of the mean fruit weight in tc by 11 7 tp by 19 2 and tl by 27 5 the statistical analysis revealed that there were high significant differences and significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on mean fruit weight the use of soil organic amendments under rain fed conditions ni increased significantly the pulp stone ratio from 1 54 in the control plot to reach 2 03 1 87 and 2 1 in tp tm and tl respectively as a result of irrigation with saline water ir the pulp stone ratio increased significantly by about 39 9 41 34 10 83 and 13 77 in tc tp tm and tl plots respectively statistical analysis revealed that there were significant differences and significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on the pulp stone ratio table 1 only the use of omww tm under rain fed conditions ni decreased significantly the olive oil content in fresh matter to reach about 7 7 the irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly the olive oil content to reach 14 of fresh matter in tc and tp plots and 12 of fresh matter in tm and tl treatments table 1 the statistical analysis revealed that there were very significant differences and significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on the oil yield comparing to control we observed that soil organic amendments under rain fed conditions ni were effective to ameliorate significantly the oil yield by about 106 6 and 65 respectively in olive trees plots amended by compost tp by olive mill wastewater tm and those intercropped with legumes tl similarly complementary irrigation with saline water ir increased significantly oil yield from 132 to 273 8 kg ha 1 in tc from 269 to 553 kg ha 1 in tp from 140 to 304 kg ha 1 in tm and from 218 4 to 392 5 kg ha 1 in tl table 1 3 4 effects of soil organic amendments and complementary irrigation on fruit and oil phenol contents total phenols in olive fruit and olive oil were quantified at harvest and the effects of soil organic amendments ni and irrigation with saline water ir on these contents were investigated and shown in fig 5 a statistical analysis showed that there were very significant differences but no significant interactions between soil organic amendments and irrigation effects on the phenol content in fruits however phenol content in olive oil seems to be significantly affected only by the soil organic amendments under rain fed conditions ni the lowest values of phenol contents in fruits and oil were recorded in trees amended with compost tp on the other hand no differences on phenol contents in fruits and oil were found between trees of tc and plots amended with omww and those intercropped with legumes irrigation with saline water induced a significant decrease in the fruit phenol content in all treatments while phenol oil content was mainly affected in trees amended by compost and it remained unaffected by the use of omww and cover crops fig 5b 4 discussion the soil water content swc values measured at 30 cm soil depth seem to be low as affected mainly by the applied treatments and by the soil evaporation in the superficial layer swc levels were improved by the complementary irrigation as mentioned previously by many authors ben ahmed et al 2009 ghrab et al 2013 but among soil organic amendments only tp plot presented the highest swc value in a line with our results ramos and marttinez casasnovas 2006 suggested that composted cattle manure applied to the soils showed a positive effect improving infiltration and decreasing runoff volumes by up to 20 and were more influenced by the compost quantity applied adugna 2016 the complementary irrigation by saline water in combination with the different soil organic amendments significantly affected the soil electrical conductivity as shown in fig 3 the use of compost olive mill wastewater and legumes as cover crops modified differently the soil electrical conductivity in fact on all dates of measurements the high values of the sec observed in the plot amended with omww can be explained by the composition of this material which presented a high salinity level as well as a high content of phenolic compounds mekki et al 2013 this finding was supported by many authors after a short and long term application of omww in olive orchards magdich et al 2016 vella et al 2016 the soil electrical conductivity increased at a depth between 0 20 cm and was proportional to the supplied volume of olive mill wastewater as suggested by di serio et al 2008 sierra et al 2007 and mekki et al 2009 in our study the low values of the sec recorded in the soils of tp and tl were probably caused by the organic matter accumulation in the superficial soil layers semida et al 2014 and ouni et al 2014 found that soil electrical conductivity values tend to decrease probably due to the occurrence of the charged sites i e coo and account for the ability of humate to chelate and retain cation in non active forms in addition rady et al 2016 founded that the reduced electrical conductivity of the added organic matter contributed to the decrease of sec during the dry period of 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons the sec in the superficial soil layer of 30 cm depth increased as compared to the sec measurements at the wet period sec variability was due to the soil humidity which was influenced by the rainfall distribution and the soil evaporation fig1 in line with our results ben ahmed et al 2009 and ghrab et al 2013 showed that irrigation of olive trees with saline water increased the soil salinity which is not only dependent to water salinity levels but also to the soil texture and climatic conditions the significant decreased leaf na contents in the plots amended with compost olive mill wastewater and those intercropped with legumes were the results of the organic matter improvement as published by chehab et al 2019 in a previous work on the same olive orchard the addition of compost reduced significantly the accumulation of na in plant leaves and was related to the amount of compost added rady et al 2016 more recently mbarki et al 2020 reported that dried municipal solid waste compost and farmyard manure compensates the negative effects of salty water on plant growth and nutrient uptake the improvement of plant performance grown under high salinity levels using legume species as cover crops as observed in our study was well explained previously by bruning et al 2015 and chehab et al 2018 our results showed also that soil amendment with olive mill wastewater using saline water for irrigation increased the leaf na level to reach toxic values these findings can be explained by the mobilization of high na amounts stored in the soil of tm plot by means of the irrigation flow during the dry period the analyzed n and k contents in olive leaves at the end of the 2017 cropping season on year were lower than the critical n and k deficiency thresholds for olive trees as published by fernández escobar et al 2015 and de souza et al 2019 these findings can be explained by the high nutrient export during fruit production recorded on 2017 cropping season table 1 the rate of n annually exported for fruit production is about 8 g of n kg 1 rodrigues et al 2013 the increased leaf n and k levels as a result of irrigation with saline water was probably due to the increased water flow in irrigated trees which facilitates availability and nutrient uptake from the soil as suggested by erel et al 2018 who showed that nutrient uptake for olive trees is related to the applied irrigation doses nevertheless kasırğa and demiral 2016 found that irrigation of olive seedlings by high salinity water decreased the n and k concentrations in olive leaves compared to control plants irrigated by tap water except for olive trees intercropped with legumes we found a very high reduction of leaf p level in trees of tc tm and tp after irrigation with saline water in this context bhadha et al 2012 and baker et al 2013 mentioned that phosphate concentration in field grown agronomic crops as well as in the soil solution decreased as soil salinity increased more recently the effects of salts on phosphorus availability in alkaline tunisian soils were well studied and documented by beji et al 2017 regarding the high level of leaf p recorded in olive trees intercropped with legumes zhou et al 2017 reported that legume species increased the soil microbial community which decreased soil ph and increased the mineralization of organic p because phosphatase activity is higher in the rhizosphere of legumes the significant interactions between irrigation water salinity and soil organic amendments as well as the use of legumes as cover crops significantly increased shoot growth and oil yield the use of compost and legumes as cover crops reduced the negative effects of saline water on crop growth and oil yield by decreasing the accumulated sodium ions in olive leaves of tp and tl treatments as reported recently by chehab et al 2018 the increased water use by irrigation as well as by soil amendment materials organic matter water retaining substances increased the oil yield per hectare lodolini et al 2014 ghrab et al 2013 lodolini et al 2016 chehab et al 2017 chehab et al 2019 it has been found that the oil content per fresh matter was related to the crop load fruit weight fruit humidity as well as the maturity index iniesta et al 2009 chehab et al 2017 ghrab et al 2013 reported that the increase of irrigation amount decreased olive oil content per fruit fresh weight the presence of phenolic compounds in fruits and oil contributes to the nutritional value and sensory characteristics and has been of major interest to researchers due to their positive effects on both human health and the olive and oil itself servili et al 2004 tekaya et al 2013 tekaya et al 2016a b among the studied soil organic amendments only compost affected negatively the phenol contents in fruits and olive oil these findings were in contradiction with those reported by chehab et al 2019 in their previous work conducted in the same experimental orchard in 2015 cropping season and where they found highest contents of oil phenols in the plot amended with compost regni et al 2017 this phenomenon could be explained by the organic matter mineralization process and the high n availability to olive trees as well as the high soil water content in this plot tp the negative effects of n supply or high soil humidity on phenol concentration were also observed and explained in previous studies fernández escobar et al 2006 tekaya et al 2016a b the accumulation of polyphenols in fruits and oil produced from olive trees of tc and tm plots from which high leaf na levels and low swc values were reported suggested that the antioxidant machinery of olive trees functioned adequately increased total phenol contents have been also observed in olive trees subjected to various environmental stresses such as cold stress ortega garcía and peragón 2009 water deficit tekaya et al 2016a b chehab et al 2017 and salt stress ben ahmed et al 2009 and it was suggested that phenolics act as antioxidants petridis et al 2012 it has been reported that omww application caused similar effects to those of mild water deficit stress ouzounidou et al 2010 mechri et al 2011 the phenol accumulation in fruits and oil of olive trees intercropped with legumes could be due to the high level of phosphorus in olive leaves tekaya et al 2013 as well as the limited soil water availability occurred during fruit growth and oil accumulation in this plot tl the negative effects of irrigation on total phenol contents in fruits and oil observed in our study were also reported in previous works bedbabis et al 2015 tekaya et al 2016a b in fact irrigation affects negatively the activity of l phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal the key enzyme in phenolic biosynthesis thus decreasing phenolic levels being lowered as the supply of water increased lodolini et al 2014 5 conclusion in semiarid regions such as tunisia since soil of olive orchards are poor and fresh water resources are often scarce the use of soil organic amendments combined with a limited saline water irrigation has been shown to be an important element in typical organic olive orchards because of its potential benefits a significant interaction between complementary irrigation with saline water and soil organic amendments was observed affecting sodium accumulation in olive leaves and oil yield especially when using compost as amendment and legumes as cover crops the study indicated that compost in both rain fed and irrigated plots is an efficient amendment for soil water holding capacity reducing the negative effects of water salinity on soil and olive trees and it increased the shoot growth as well as the oil yield the use of legumes as cover crops seems to be the most efficient organic amendment in reducing the water salt effects on soils as well as on olive trees for which the lowest na and the highest p levels in olive leaves were observed olive mill wastewater is not appropriate for use in combination with saline water irrigation as it increased the soil electrical conductivity and accentuated the na accumulation in olive leaves to reach the salt toxic limits we observed also in the current study that the factor soil organic amendments revealed much more efficient in enhancing the oil phenol contents of olive trees than complementary irrigation with saline water taken together these findings are of greatest interest because we proved that for organic olive orchards grown under arid climate irrigation with saline water can be applied sustainably when combined with compost or legume cover crops with limited effects on soil salinity and olive tree performance declaration of

10603,pedotransfer functions were often applied to predict the soil water contents at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp which are the key parameters used in the soil nitrogen n biogeochemical models for simulating the nitrate n o 3 n leaching however the ptf prediction uncertainty was often ignored in addition the uncertainty of the n model structure soil n cycling is described with a set of equations can also be substantial based on the 12 classic pedotransfer functions ptfs namely baumer brakensiek rawls british soil survey topsoil british soil survey subsoil epic hutson manrique rawls campbell mayr jarvis rawls brakensiek and vereecken and 2 biogeochemical models daycent and denitrification decomposition dndc this study evaluated the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty in soil no3 n leaching modelling on a tea garden hillslope in taihu lake basin china the ensemble mean was then applied to combine the 12 outputs of each model and the 24 outputs of both models finally the linear bias correction combined with the ensemble mean i e the ensemble bias correction ebc was also applied for the prediction of the leachate no3 n concentrations data on basic soil properties were used to derive the fc and pwp by using the 12 ptfs results showed that both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were equally important in soil n o 3 n leaching modelling at four slope positions the coefficients of variation of the n o 3 n concentration forecasts obtained by different ptfs representing the ptf prediction uncertainty were positively related to the climate factors especially when ptfs were used in daycent ensemble mean was found to produce a very large bias in the prediction of the leachate n o 3 n concentrations which is due to the prediction bias of ptfs the ebc can substantially improve the prediction of the soil n o 3 n leaching especially when the 24 outputs of both models were combined keywords nitrate leaching ptf prediction uncertainty model structural uncertainty ensemble bias correction biogeochemical models 1 introduction nitrogen n is an essential element for plant growth and crop yield mclay et al 2001 however the loss of n via nitrate n o 3 n leaching to groundwater bodies increased rapidly since the global use of n fertilizer has increased 10 fold in the last 50 years fao 2013 in china n losses in intensive farming regions have been deemed as one of the most common agricultural sources of nonpoint water pollution zhu et al 2006 li et al 2014 gao et al 2019 for example li et al 2014 found that the n o 3 n leaching load was equivalent to 26 1 of the total amount of n fertilizer applied in northern china leading to heavy groundwater contamination with the conversion of a large amount of bamboo forests to tea garden to pursue higher economical returns particularly in taihu lake basin these land use conversions aggravated the possibility of soil n losses zhu et al 2014 liao et al 2019 in this region the average fertilizer application rates for the tea garden ecosystem were as high as 550 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which was an important cause of eutrophication in taihu lake qin et al 2007 therefore quantifying n o 3 n leaching from tea garden is of great significance for nonpoint source pollution control in order to optimize fertilizer application for different cropping systems a great number of experiments have been carried out kuo and jellum 2000 cao and yin 2015 however it is very difficult to obtain the temporal variations of soil n o 3 n leaching through the measurement method due to the limited resources and the temporal resolution of sampling is often coarse therefore the process based models are required to simulate soil n o 3 n leaching the daycent del grosso et al 2000 parton et al 2001 and dndc li et al 1992a b models are two widely used biogeochemical models for modelling soil n losses the daycent model is the daily time step version of the century model and has been successfully applied to simulate n cycles for various ecosystems del grosso et al 2000 the dndc model was originally developed in north america li et al 1992a and then verified in europe kesik et al 2006 and asia li et al 2014 previous studies have compared the accuracy of the daycent and dndc models for n cycle simulation abdalla et al 2010 wu and zhang 2014 they found that these two models have their own advantages and disadvantages and it is difficult to choose the best model more importantly n biogeochemical processes of soils are described with a set of equations i e the model structure there is the structural uncertainty in soil n models since the conceptual model is not able to represent the real n biogeochemical processes in other words all models are not perfect and have their limitations for instance nitrification and denitrification processes occur at the same time and are mutually influenced by each other indicating a knowledge gap of core processes describing n biogeochemical cycle arhonditsis et al 2008 soil water contents at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp are necessary parameters for modelling of soil n o 3 n leaching li et al 2014 but on a large scale they are hard to measure givi et al 2004 pedotransfer functions ptfs are routinely applied to predict the soil hydraulic properties e g water retention characteristics and saturated hydraulic conductivity from easily measurable data e g soil texture and organic matter content salazar et al 2008 evaluated the rosetta ptf in field scale hydrological modelling chirico et al 2010 assessed the feasibility of using two ptfs vereecken s ptf and hypres ptf to simulate soil water budget at a hillslope scale liao et al 2014 applied six ptfs to predict soil hydraulic properties which were then used to estimate profile soil moisture variations in a forest site however the accuracy of ptfs outside of their development area is unknown due to the empirical relationships of ptfs at present there is no good way to decide with ptf should be applied for a specific region liao et al 2014 when ptfs are used in soil n models it is important to investigate the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty however these two uncertainties are usually ignored in ptf applications meteorological and hydrological forecasting faced similar uncertainties to deal with the model uncertainty the ensemble mean emerged as a popular method in meteorological and hydrological forecasting palmer et al 2004 the goal of ensemble mean is to improve the simulation accuracy by combining the prediction of multiple independent models the focus of previous research is whether the ensemble mean can achieve better performance than a single model guber et al 2009 liao et al 2017a it can be concluded that if there is no systematic model bias ensemble mean will produce better results guber et al 2009 otherwise its accuracy will be very poor in this case the linear bias correction lbc was often combined with the ensemble mean i e ensemble bias correction ebc to improve the prediction accuracy jana et al 2007 liao et al 2017a lbc shifts the ensemble forecasts proportionally so that the mean of the forecast value is closer to that of the observation value to date however little research was conducted to explore the effectiveness of using ebc to simulate n o 3 n leaching in soil based on this background the process based daycent and dndc models were applied to predict soil n o 3 n leaching from a tea garden hillslope fc and pwp were obtained from textural fractions organic carbon content and bulk density by using 12 classical ptfs available in soilpar 2 software acutis and donatelli 2003 the objectives of this study were to i quantify the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty in soil n o 3 n leaching modelling ii investigate the controlling factors of the degree of the model uncertainty and iii evaluate the effectiveness of using the ensemble mean and ebc to predict the leachate n o 3 n concentrations we hypothesized that the ensemble mean produces a large bias in the prediction of the leachate n o 3 n concentrations in addition the ebc is hypothesized to improve the predictions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling design the research hillslope 0 4 ha located in the western hilly area of taihu lake basin china 31 21 n 119 03 e fig 1 belongs to

is shown in table 3 daycent contains several key sub models i e plant production litter and soil organic matter decomposition nutrient mineralization n emissions methane oxidation multi layer soil moisture and temperature parton et al 1998 del grosso et al 2011 daycent calculates evapotranspiration with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 plant growth is controlled by nutrient availability water and temperature nutrient supply is a function of soil organic matter decomposition and external nutrient additions abdalla et al 2010 daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation timing and description of management events and soil texture data are needed as model inputs dndc contains six interacting submodels for simulating soil climate plant growth decomposition nitrification denitrification and fermentation respectively li et al 1992a the dndc model calculates evapotranspiration with the adapted thornthwaite equation which includes a multiplier for wind speed crop growth is driven by gdd above 0 c and daily growth is derived from the potential daily biomass growth kg c ha 1 that can be constrained by abiotic stresses water frost and heat li et al 1994 crop n uptake is a function of root biomass and n availability in the soil profile nitrogen accumulates in the plant over time as a function of the daily potential biomass growth and the corresponding plant c n ratio kröbel et al 2011 the transformation of soil n is simulated in the decomposition nitrification and denitrification submodels while n o 3 n leaching is simulated as mass flow with water flux and diffusion driven by concentration gradient since the measured n o 3 n concentration was obtained in monthly intervals the simulated cumulative water percolation and nitrate leaching fluxes by daycent and dndc were used to determine the n o 3 n concentration in the leachate over the same periods for comparison for both models the period from 2013 to 2015 was used for model spin up while the period of year 2016 2018 was applied for model validation the primary time step of the simulation is 1 day the spin up period was to eliminate the influence of initial conditions on simulation results model calibration focused primarily on crop parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity fc and pwp with the highest agreement between the simulated leachate n o 3 n concentration and the observations the calibrated saturated hydraulic conductivity is 0 008 m hr 1 at four slope positions the calibrated fc were 0 136 0 190 0 255 and 0 186 m3 m 3 at the top upper middle and lower positions while the calibrated pwp are 0 097 0 124 0 166 and 0 121 m3 m 3 respectively the calibrated crop parameters of the four slope positions are the same for the grain leaf stem and root the calibrated initial biomass c n ratios were 15 15 25 and 35 respectively in addition the calibrated initial maximum biomass production of grains leaves stems and roots were 20 500 200 and 280 kgc ha 1 yr 1 respectively 2 4 statistical analysis twelve ptfs were used to predict the fc and pwp from the basic soil properties at four slope positions estimated fc and pwp were then applied to simulate the leachate n o 3 n concentration by using daycent and dndc a total of 12 independent models represented the ptf prediction uncertainty model parameters other than the fc and pwp were identical for each independent model when using daycent or dndc in addition 24 independent models 2 soil n models and 12 ptfs represented both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty the coefficient of variation cv standard deviation divided by mean of the daycent and dndc modelled n o 3 n concentration by using 12 ptfs was used to measure the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty the paired t test was applied to test the significant differences in cvs between the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty the ensemble mean was used to combine outputs of all independent models for simulating the leachate n o 3 n concentration the lbc which shifts the ensemble mean forecasts proportionally and makes the means closer to that of the observations was then combined with the ensemble mean to improve the predictions 8 y a 0 a x e m where y is the ebc forecast a 0 is the intercept a is the slope and x em is the ensemble mean forecast ebc conducts linear regression analysis between the ensemble mean and the observations during the calibration period and the obtained regression equation is then used for validation due to the small number of measured values in this study the bootstrap sampling method efron and tibshirani 1993 was used to generate multiple calibration and validation datasets the calibration dataset containing 23 samples can be generated by repeated random resampling with replacement of the original dataset of 23 samples fig 3 since resampling is conducted with replacement each bootstrap realization contains approximately 63 of the original dataset while the remaining 37 of the dataset was served as the validation dataset the number of bootstrap realizations is critical for accurately evaluating the ebc method efron and tibshirani 1993 suggested that the number of bootstrap realizations should be larger than 50 therefore 100 realizations were used in this study for each realization a root mean squared error rmse value can be calculated for the validation dataset the average of 100 rmse values was used for evaluating the performance of the ebc method 3 results 3 1 daycent and dndc modelled results by using 12 ptfs based on the 12 ptfs the daycent modelled total water percolation during 2016 2018 ranged between 204 2 259 8 cm 203 8 308 2 cm 205 0 345 0 cm and 203 5 279 8 cm at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively while the dndc modelled values ranged between 205 6 229 7 cm 204 0 234 4 cm 196 1 236 4 cm and 194 1 220 8 cm respectively fig 4 for the total n o 3 n leaching fluxes the daycent simulated values ranged between 57 18 68 17 g m 2 57 98 68 21 g m 2 39 41 67 19 g m 2 and 57 85 68 72 g m 2 at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively while the dndc simulated values ranged between 41 98 48 00 g m 2 41 91 58 65 g m 2 43 03 61 98 g m 2 and 46 19 63 62 g m 2 respectively fig 5 from may 2016 to march 2018 a substantial fluctuation of the leachate n o 3 n concentration was observed at four slope positions fig 6 the observed n o 3 n concentration was 1 49 22 91 mg l 1 1 43 32 74 mg l 1 0 52 28 53 mg l 1 and 1 59 24 71 mg l 1 at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively the ensemble mean n o 3 n concentrations obtained by the daycent and dndc models and 12 ptfs were found to be substantially higher than the observations in most cases 3 2 quantification of the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty fig 7 shows the cvs of the daycent and dndc modelled n o 3 n concentrations by using 12 ptfs at four slope positions when ptfs were used in the daycent model the mean cvs were 0 182 0 209 0 263 and 0 179 at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively while the mean cvs were 0 204 0 232 0 316 and 0 247 when ptfs were applied in the dndc model respectively when ptfs were used in both models the mean cvs were 0 465 0 477 0 517 and 0 475 respectively the t test results showed that the cvs when ptfs used in both models were significantly p 0 05 larger than those when ptfs using in a single model while there was no significant p 0 05 difference between the cvs when ptfs used in daycent and those when ptfs used in dndc 3 3 influencing factors of the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty the correlations between the cvs of the daycent and dndc modelled n o 3 n concentrations by using 12 ptfs and the climate factors i e cumulative precipitation and average air temperature during the interval of two consecutive samplings were investigated in this study fig 8 there was no significant p 0 05 correlation between the cv and cumulative precipitation when ptfs used in the daycent model while the cvs were significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with the cumulative precipitation when ptfs used in the dndc model at the upper and middle slope positions the correlations between the cv and average temperature when ptfs used in daycent were higher than those when ptfs used in dndc at each slope position both of which were significant at the 0 05 level weak correlations were found between the cv and climate factors when ptfs used in both models accounting for both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty 3 4 evaluation of the ensemble mean and ensemble bias correction methods the measured leachate n o 3 n concentration and the ensemble means without lbc obtained by the two models were compared and are shown in fig 9 the ensemble mean method always produced a large bias in the prediction of the leachate n o 3 n concentrations due to the prediction bias of ptfs with very high rmses however a good positively linear relationship was found between the measured and predicted values especially when ptfs were used in both models after lbc the performances of the ensemble mean method for predicting the leachate n o 3 n concentration obtained by the two models are shown in fig 10 the rmses of the ebc were 4 90 6 14 5 96 and 7 20 mg l 1 when ptfs were used in daycent at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively while the rmses were 4 42 6 47 6 05 and 6 29 mg l 1 when ptfs were used in dndc respectively however the rmses of the ebc were 4 30 5 72 5 50 and 5 93 mg l 1 when ptfs were used in both models respectively 4 discussion the total water percolation and n o 3 n leaching fluxes simulated by the daycent model were generally higher than those simulated by the dndc model during 2016 2018 figs 4 and 5 this is confirmed by the study of wu and zhang 2014 who observed that the daycent model produced higher soil water filled pore space than the dndc model when simulating n cycle in paddy fields higher soil water content can result in more water percolation and substantial flux discrepancies between the daycent and dndc simulated data since soil water status is a critical determinant of n cycle dobbie and smith 2001 castellano et al 2011 zhu et al 2018 among the 12 ptfs the ptf proposed by mayr and jarvis 1999 m j yielded more water percolation this is related to the fact that the m j predicted fc was substantially smaller than the other ptfs therefore it is easier for soil to reach the fc when using this ptf soil water content beyond the fc has great potential to drain away lai et al 2018 the ptf prediction uncertainty when ptfs were used in daycent was similar to that when ptfs were applied in dndc fig 7 in addition the mean cvs when ptfs used in both models accounting for both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were almost two times larger than those when only the ptf prediction uncertainty was considered this suggests that the both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were equally important in soil n o 3 n leaching modelling at different slope positions previous studies have also found that daycent and dndc models were quite different in the simulation of soil water content li et al 2005 n uptake sansoulet et al 2014 and nitrous oxide emissions frolking et al 1998 this is attributed to different hydrological and n cycle algorithms adopted by these two models table 3 developing a powerful n model structure and obtaining accurate fc and pwp are critical in the estimation of n o 3 n leaching in soils in future studies it should be noted that only variations in fc and pwp were tested to estimate the ptf prediction uncertainty in this study it is because that the fc and pwp are very important parameters influencing the soil n o 3 n leaching in both the daycent and the dndc cascade models excess water above fc is drained through the profile at the maximum rate of the saturated conductivity or allocated to runoff or deep water storage which can increase the water percolation and n o 3 n leaching copper and roberts 1996 observed that within year variability in n o 3 n concentrations was related to weather conditions with high concentrations when fc was reached if this occurred late in the year huber et al 2012 also found that the main factor explaining the differences in n o 3 n concentrations was the fc between the plots within mixed forest and grass the saturated hydraulic conductivity is another important hydraulic parameter however only three hydraulic conductivity ptfs derived using large databases were found in the existing research rawls et al 1998 wösten et al 1999 schaap et al 2001 therefore the ensemble with different water retention ptfs were focused on in this study in addition there are certainly a large number of additional soil n models e g stics epic and nleap that can simulate the soil n o 3 n leaching only dndc and daycent models were considered in this study since they are most widely used at site scale more importantly these two models have great differences in model structure especially in the simulation of nitrification and denitrification processes table 3 a wider range of n models can be included to quantify more accurately the model structural uncertainty in future research the increase in the cumulative precipitation and average air temperature during the interval of two consecutive samplings would significantly p 0 05 enlarge the degree of the ptf prediction uncertainty fig 8 the possible reason is that the increase of precipitation results in the increase of hillslope soil water content and subsurface flow liao et al 2017b which would increase the difference in water percolation forecasts among different ptfs in addition the increase of air temperature will enhance the activity of nitrifying bacteria suszek łopatka et al 2016 in this case the difference in n o 3 n leaching forecasts among different ptfs tended to be higher with the increase of precipitation and air temperature many previous studies have found that climate factors significantly affected temporal variations of leachate n o 3 n concentrations sänger et al 2011 cameron et al 2013 but little research has focused on the controlling factors of the degree of the uncertainty in the predicted leachate n o 3 n concentrations our findings can provide crucial information for the accurate simulation of the soil n biogeochemical processes for example the uncertainty of the n o 3 n leaching simulation tends to be greater in summer when the temperature is relatively high and the precipitation is relatively large so the optimization of the soil n model should be paid more attention during this period the ensemble mean produced a large bias when simulating the leachate n o 3 n concentrations fig 9 this may be related to the prediction bias of ptfs since the accuracy of ptfs outside of their development area is generally low in addition nearly all ptfs developed in the last few decades including the 12 ptfs used in this study do not consider the effect of the rock fragment content on the soil water contents at fc and pwp previous studies have found that the physical properties of rock fragments are different from those of the fine earth of the soil cousin et al 2003 liao et al 2019 in this case using the 12 ptfs to predict the properties of soils with high rock fragment contents table 1 may cause the bias in predictions the defect of the model structure was another reason of the prediction bias daycent and dndc are good at simulate the n cycle since classic laws of physics chemistry and biology have been incorporated in the models to parameterize the biogeochemical reaction but sometimes perform poorly in capturing soil hydrological processes since both models are based on the simple cascade approach instead of the richards equation kröebel et al 2010 coupling the n biogeochemistry models with more complex soil hydrology models e g hydrus based on the richards equation may be an effective way to solve the deficits of daycent and dndc kraus et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 after lbc the rmses of the ensemble mean decreased remarkably fig 10 the performances of the ebc when ptfs were used in both models were better than those when ptfs used in each model this indicates that ebc can yield the best results when both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were included which is related to the strongest correlation between the measured n o 3 n concentrations and the ensemble means obtained by combining 2 models and 12 ptfs fig 9 previous studies also found that the larger number of ensemble members can result in the more comprehensive interpretation of model uncertainty krishnamurti et al 2000 palmer et al 2004 the premise of the use of multiple source simulation systems is based on the hypothesis that we do not know which independent model is the best in advance in other words all models contribute to the ensemble this hypothesis is supported by previous studies for example abdalla et al 2010 found that the daycent model effectively estimated the n emissions and biomass production from the irish grasslands compared with the dndc model however wu and zhang 2014 observed that the dndc model performed better than the daycent model for simulating n emissions from paddy fields the various conclusions suggest that the performance of the model may be related to the site conditions such as climate soil and land use unfortunately using combinations of individual forecasts did not create predictors with excellent performance due to the systematic bias although lbc was performed the ensemble mean only accounted for the first moment mean of the data not the second moment spread of the values therefore the nonlinear bias correction technique which has the ability to bring the variance of the ensemble means closer to that of the measured values can be a promising tool for future research 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty in the simulated leachate n o 3 n concentrations and evaluated the ensemble mean and ebc methods for reducing the model uncertainty on a tea garden hillslope in taihu lake basin china through our results we found that both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were equally important in soil n o 3 n leaching modelling the ensemble mean failed to deal with the model uncertainty due to a large bias in the simulated leachate n o 3 n concentrations by using ptfs the performances of the ensemble mean were substantially improved after lbc showing that the rmses of the ebc were 4 30 5 72 5 50 and 5 93 mg l 1 when ptfs were used in both models at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively overall our findings indicated that the ebc was a viable approach for simulating n o 3 n leaching in soils

10603,pedotransfer functions were often applied to predict the soil water contents at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp which are the key parameters used in the soil nitrogen n biogeochemical models for simulating the nitrate n o 3 n leaching however the ptf prediction uncertainty was often ignored in addition the uncertainty of the n model structure soil n cycling is described with a set of equations can also be substantial based on the 12 classic pedotransfer functions ptfs namely baumer brakensiek rawls british soil survey topsoil british soil survey subsoil

model structural uncertainty in soil no3 n leaching modelling on a tea garden hillslope in taihu lake basin china the ensemble mean was then applied to combine the 12 outputs of each model and the 24 outputs of both models finally the linear bias correction combined with the ensemble mean i e the ensemble bias correction ebc was also applied for the prediction of the leachate no3 n concentrations data on basic soil properties were used to derive the fc and pwp by using the 12 ptfs results showed that both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were equally important in soil n o 3

related to the climate factors especially when ptfs were used in daycent ensemble mean was found to produce a very large bias in the prediction of the leachate n o 3 n concentrations which is due to the prediction bias of ptfs the ebc can substantially improve the prediction of the soil n o 3 n leaching especially when the 24 outputs of both models were combined keywords nitrate leaching ptf prediction uncertainty model structural uncertainty ensemble bias correction biogeochemical models 1 introduction nitrogen n is an essential element for plant growth and crop yield mclay et al 2001 however the loss of n via nitrate n o 3 n leaching to groundwater bodies increased rapidly since the global use of n fertilizer has increased 10 fold in the last 50 years fao 2013 in china n losses in intensive farming regions have been deemed as one of the most common agricultural sources of nonpoint water pollution zhu et al 2006 li et al 2014 gao et al 2019 for example li et al 2014 found that the n o 3 n leaching load was equivalent to 26 1 of the total amount of n fertilizer applied in northern china leading to heavy groundwater contamination with the conversion of a large amount of bamboo forests to tea garden to pursue higher economical returns particularly in taihu lake basin these land use conversions aggravated the possibility of soil n losses zhu et al 2014 liao et al 2019 in this region the average fertilizer application rates for the tea garden ecosystem were as high as 550 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which was an important cause of eutrophication in taihu lake qin et al 2007 therefore quantifying n o 3 n leaching from tea garden is of great significance for nonpoint source pollution control in order to optimize fertilizer application for different cropping systems a great number of experiments have been carried out kuo and jellum 2000 cao and yin 2015 however it is very difficult to obtain the temporal variations of soil n o 3 n leaching through the measurement method due to the limited resources and the temporal resolution of sampling is often coarse therefore the process based models are required to simulate soil n o 3 n leaching the daycent del grosso et al 2000 parton et al 2001 and dndc li et al 1992a b models are two widely used biogeochemical models for modelling soil n losses the daycent model is the daily time step version of the century model and has been successfully applied to simulate n cycles for various ecosystems del grosso et al 2000 the dndc model was originally developed in north america li et al 1992a and then verified in europe kesik et al 2006 and asia li et al 2014 previous studies have compared the accuracy of the daycent and dndc models for n cycle simulation abdalla et al 2010 wu and zhang 2014 they found that these two models have their own advantages and disadvantages and it is difficult to choose the best model more importantly n biogeochemical processes of soils are described with a set of equations i e the model structure there is the structural uncertainty in soil n models since the conceptual model is not able to represent the real n biogeochemical processes in other words all models are not perfect and have their limitations for instance nitrification and denitrification processes occur at the same time and are mutually influenced by each other indicating a knowledge gap of core processes describing n biogeochemical cycle arhonditsis et al 2008 soil water contents at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp are necessary parameters for modelling of soil n o 3 n leaching li et al 2014 but on a large scale they are hard to measure givi et al 2004 pedotransfer functions ptfs are routinely applied to predict the soil hydraulic properties e g water retention characteristics and saturated hydraulic conductivity from easily measurable data e g soil texture and organic matter content salazar et al 2008 evaluated the rosetta ptf in field scale hydrological modelling chirico et al 2010 assessed the feasibility of using two ptfs vereecken s ptf and hypres ptf to simulate soil water budget at a hillslope scale liao et al 2014 applied six ptfs to predict soil hydraulic properties which were then used to estimate profile soil moisture variations in a forest site however the accuracy of ptfs outside of their development area is unknown due to the empirical relationships of ptfs at present there is no good way to decide with ptf should be applied for a specific region liao et al 2014 when ptfs are used in soil n models it is important to investigate the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty however these two uncertainties are usually ignored in ptf applications meteorological and hydrological forecasting faced similar uncertainties to deal with the model uncertainty the ensemble mean emerged as a popular method in meteorological and hydrological forecasting palmer et al 2004 the goal of ensemble mean is to improve the simulation accuracy by combining the prediction of multiple independent models the focus of previous research is whether the ensemble mean can achieve better performance than a single model guber et al 2009 liao et al 2017a it can be concluded that if there is no systematic model bias ensemble mean will produce better results guber et al 2009 otherwise its accuracy will be very poor in this case the linear bias correction lbc was often combined with the ensemble mean i e ensemble bias correction ebc to improve the prediction accuracy jana et al 2007 liao et al 2017a lbc shifts the ensemble forecasts proportionally so that the mean of the forecast value is closer to that of the observation value to date however little research was conducted to explore the effectiveness of using ebc to simulate n o 3 n leaching in soil based on this background the process based daycent and dndc models were applied to predict soil n o 3 n leaching from a tea garden hillslope fc and pwp were obtained from textural fractions organic carbon content and bulk density by using 12 classical ptfs available in soilpar 2 software acutis and donatelli 2003 the objectives of this study were to i quantify the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty in soil n o 3 n leaching modelling ii investigate the controlling factors of the degree of the model uncertainty and iii evaluate the effectiveness of using the ensemble mean and ebc to predict the leachate n o 3 n concentrations we hypothesized that the ensemble mean produces a large bias in the prediction of the leachate n o 3 n concentrations in addition the ebc is hypothesized to improve the predictions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling design the research hillslope 0 4 ha located in the western hilly area of taihu lake basin china 31 21 n 119 03 e fig 1 belongs to

is shown in table 3 daycent contains several key sub models i e plant production litter and soil organic matter decomposition nutrient mineralization n emissions methane oxidation multi layer soil moisture and temperature parton et al 1998 del grosso et al 2011 daycent calculates evapotranspiration with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 plant growth is controlled by nutrient availability water and temperature nutrient supply is a function of soil organic matter decomposition and external nutrient additions abdalla et al 2010 daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation timing and description of management events and soil texture data are needed as model inputs dndc contains six interacting submodels for simulating soil climate plant growth decomposition nitrification denitrification and fermentation respectively li et al 1992a the dndc model calculates evapotranspiration with the adapted thornthwaite equation which includes a multiplier for wind speed crop growth is driven by gdd above 0 c and daily growth is derived from the potential daily biomass growth kg c ha 1 that can be constrained by abiotic stresses water frost and heat li et al 1994 crop n uptake is a function of root biomass and n availability in the soil profile nitrogen accumulates in the plant over time as a function of the daily potential biomass growth and the corresponding plant c n ratio kröbel et al 2011 the transformation of soil n is simulated in the decomposition nitrification and denitrification submodels while n o 3 n leaching is simulated as mass flow with water flux and diffusion driven by concentration gradient since the measured n o 3 n concentration was obtained in monthly intervals the simulated cumulative water percolation and nitrate leaching fluxes by daycent and dndc were used to determine the n o 3 n concentration in the leachate over the same periods for comparison for both models the period from 2013 to 2015 was used for model spin up while the period of year 2016 2018 was applied for model validation the primary time step of the simulation is 1 day the spin up period was to eliminate the influence of initial conditions on simulation results model calibration focused primarily on crop parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity fc and pwp with the highest agreement between the simulated leachate n o 3 n concentration and the observations the calibrated saturated hydraulic conductivity is 0 008 m hr 1 at four slope positions the calibrated fc were 0 136 0 190 0 255 and 0 186 m3 m 3 at the top upper middle and lower positions while the calibrated pwp are 0 097 0 124 0 166 and 0 121 m3 m 3 respectively the calibrated crop parameters of the four slope positions are the same for the grain leaf stem and root the calibrated initial biomass c n ratios were 15 15 25 and 35 respectively in addition the calibrated initial maximum biomass production of grains leaves stems and roots were 20 500 200 and 280 kgc ha 1 yr 1 respectively 2 4 statistical analysis twelve ptfs were used to predict the fc and pwp from the basic soil properties at four slope positions estimated fc and pwp were then applied to simulate the leachate n o 3 n concentration by using daycent and dndc a total of 12 independent models represented the ptf prediction uncertainty model parameters other than the fc and pwp were identical for each independent model when using daycent or dndc in addition 24 independent models 2 soil n models and 12 ptfs represented both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty the coefficient of variation cv standard deviation divided by mean of the daycent and dndc modelled n o 3 n concentration by using 12 ptfs was used to measure the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty the paired t test was applied to test the significant differences in cvs between the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty the ensemble mean was used to combine outputs of all independent models for simulating the leachate n o 3 n concentration the lbc which shifts the ensemble mean forecasts proportionally and makes the means closer to that of the observations was then combined with the ensemble mean to improve the predictions 8 y a 0 a x e m where y is the ebc forecast a 0 is the intercept a is the slope and x em is the ensemble mean forecast ebc conducts linear regression analysis between the ensemble mean and the observations during the calibration period and the obtained regression equation is then used for validation due to the small number of measured values in this study the bootstrap sampling method efron and tibshirani 1993 was used to generate multiple calibration and validation datasets the calibration dataset containing 23 samples can be generated by repeated random resampling with replacement of the original dataset of 23 samples fig 3 since resampling is conducted with replacement each bootstrap realization contains approximately 63 of the original dataset while the remaining 37 of the dataset was served as the validation dataset the number of bootstrap realizations is critical for accurately evaluating the ebc method efron and tibshirani 1993 suggested that the number of bootstrap realizations should be larger than 50 therefore 100 realizations were used in this study for each realization a root mean squared error rmse value can be calculated for the validation dataset the average of 100 rmse values was used for evaluating the performance of the ebc method 3 results 3 1 daycent and dndc modelled results by using 12 ptfs based on the 12 ptfs the daycent modelled total water percolation during 2016 2018 ranged between 204 2 259 8 cm 203 8 308 2 cm 205 0 345 0 cm and 203 5 279 8 cm at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively while the dndc modelled values ranged between 205 6 229 7 cm 204 0 234 4 cm 196 1 236 4 cm and 194 1 220 8 cm respectively fig 4 for the total n o 3 n leaching fluxes the daycent simulated values ranged between 57 18 68 17 g m 2 57 98 68 21 g m 2 39 41 67 19 g m 2 and 57 85 68 72 g m 2 at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively while the dndc simulated values ranged between 41 98 48 00 g m 2 41 91 58 65 g m 2 43 03 61 98 g m 2 and 46 19 63 62 g m 2 respectively fig 5 from may 2016 to march 2018 a substantial fluctuation of the leachate n o 3 n concentration was observed at four slope positions fig 6 the observed n o 3 n concentration was 1 49 22 91 mg l 1 1 43 32 74 mg l 1 0 52 28 53 mg l 1 and 1 59 24 71 mg l 1 at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively the ensemble mean n o 3 n concentrations obtained by the daycent and dndc models and 12 ptfs were found to be substantially higher than the observations in most cases 3 2 quantification of the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty fig 7 shows the cvs of the daycent and dndc modelled n o 3 n concentrations by using 12 ptfs at four slope positions when ptfs were used in the daycent model the mean cvs were 0 182 0 209 0 263 and 0 179 at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively while the mean cvs were 0 204 0 232 0 316 and 0 247 when ptfs were applied in the dndc model respectively when ptfs were used in both models the mean cvs were 0 465 0 477 0 517 and 0 475 respectively the t test results showed that the cvs when ptfs used in both models were significantly p 0 05 larger than those when ptfs using in a single model while there was no significant p 0 05 difference between the cvs when ptfs used in daycent and those when ptfs used in dndc 3 3 influencing factors of the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty the correlations between the cvs of the daycent and dndc modelled n o 3 n concentrations by using 12 ptfs and the climate factors i e cumulative precipitation and average air temperature during the interval of two consecutive samplings were investigated in this study fig 8 there was no significant p 0 05 correlation between the cv and cumulative precipitation when ptfs used in the daycent model while the cvs were significantly p 0 05 positively correlated with the cumulative precipitation when ptfs used in the dndc model at the upper and middle slope positions the correlations between the cv and average temperature when ptfs used in daycent were higher than those when ptfs used in dndc at each slope position both of which were significant at the 0 05 level weak correlations were found between the cv and climate factors when ptfs used in both models accounting for both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty 3 4 evaluation of the ensemble mean and ensemble bias correction methods the measured leachate n o 3 n concentration and the ensemble means without lbc obtained by the two models were compared and are shown in fig 9 the ensemble mean method always produced a large bias in the prediction of the leachate n o 3 n concentrations due to the prediction bias of ptfs with very high rmses however a good positively linear relationship was found between the measured and predicted values especially when ptfs were used in both models after lbc the performances of the ensemble mean method for predicting the leachate n o 3 n concentration obtained by the two models are shown in fig 10 the rmses of the ebc were 4 90 6 14 5 96 and 7 20 mg l 1 when ptfs were used in daycent at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively while the rmses were 4 42 6 47 6 05 and 6 29 mg l 1 when ptfs were used in dndc respectively however the rmses of the ebc were 4 30 5 72 5 50 and 5 93 mg l 1 when ptfs were used in both models respectively 4 discussion the total water percolation and n o 3 n leaching fluxes simulated by the daycent model were generally higher than those simulated by the dndc model during 2016 2018 figs 4 and 5 this is confirmed by the study of wu and zhang 2014 who observed that the daycent model produced higher soil water filled pore space than the dndc model when simulating n cycle in paddy fields higher soil water content can result in more water percolation and substantial flux discrepancies between the daycent and dndc simulated data since soil water status is a critical determinant of n cycle dobbie and smith 2001 castellano et al 2011 zhu et al 2018 among the 12 ptfs the ptf proposed by mayr and jarvis 1999 m j yielded more water percolation this is related to the fact that the m j predicted fc was substantially smaller than the other ptfs therefore it is easier for soil to reach the fc when using this ptf soil water content beyond the fc has great potential to drain away lai et al 2018 the ptf prediction uncertainty when ptfs were used in daycent was similar to that when ptfs were applied in dndc fig 7 in addition the mean cvs when ptfs used in both models accounting for both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were almost two times larger than those when only the ptf prediction uncertainty was considered this suggests that the both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were equally important in soil n o 3 n leaching modelling at different slope positions previous studies have also found that daycent and dndc models were quite different in the simulation of soil water content li et al 2005 n uptake sansoulet et al 2014 and nitrous oxide emissions frolking et al 1998 this is attributed to different hydrological and n cycle algorithms adopted by these two models table 3 developing a powerful n model structure and obtaining accurate fc and pwp are critical in the estimation of n o 3 n leaching in soils in future studies it should be noted that only variations in fc and pwp were tested to estimate the ptf prediction uncertainty in this study it is because that the fc and pwp are very important parameters influencing the soil n o 3 n leaching in both the daycent and the dndc cascade models excess water above fc is drained through the profile at the maximum rate of the saturated conductivity or allocated to runoff or deep water storage which can increase the water percolation and n o 3 n leaching copper and roberts 1996 observed that within year variability in n o 3 n concentrations was related to weather conditions with high concentrations when fc was reached if this occurred late in the year huber et al 2012 also found that the main factor explaining the differences in n o 3 n concentrations was the fc between the plots within mixed forest and grass the saturated hydraulic conductivity is another important hydraulic parameter however only three hydraulic conductivity ptfs derived using large databases were found in the existing research rawls et al 1998 wösten et al 1999 schaap et al 2001 therefore the ensemble with different water retention ptfs were focused on in this study in addition there are certainly a large number of additional soil n models e g stics epic and nleap that can simulate the soil n o 3 n leaching only dndc and daycent models were considered in this study since they are most widely used at site scale more importantly these two models have great differences in model structure especially in the simulation of nitrification and denitrification processes table 3 a wider range of n models can be included to quantify more accurately the model structural uncertainty in future research the increase in the cumulative precipitation and average air temperature during the interval of two consecutive samplings would significantly p 0 05 enlarge the degree of the ptf prediction uncertainty fig 8 the possible reason is that the increase of precipitation results in the increase of hillslope soil water content and subsurface flow liao et al 2017b which would increase the difference in water percolation forecasts among different ptfs in addition the increase of air temperature will enhance the activity of nitrifying bacteria suszek łopatka et al 2016 in this case the difference in n o 3 n leaching forecasts among different ptfs tended to be higher with the increase of precipitation and air temperature many previous studies have found that climate factors significantly affected temporal variations of leachate n o 3 n concentrations sänger et al 2011 cameron et al 2013 but little research has focused on the controlling factors of the degree of the uncertainty in the predicted leachate n o 3 n concentrations our findings can provide crucial information for the accurate simulation of the soil n biogeochemical processes for example the uncertainty of the n o 3 n leaching simulation tends to be greater in summer when the temperature is relatively high and the precipitation is relatively large so the optimization of the soil n model should be paid more attention during this period the ensemble mean produced a large bias when simulating the leachate n o 3 n concentrations fig 9 this may be related to the prediction bias of ptfs since the accuracy of ptfs outside of their development area is generally low in addition nearly all ptfs developed in the last few decades including the 12 ptfs used in this study do not consider the effect of the rock fragment content on the soil water contents at fc and pwp previous studies have found that the physical properties of rock fragments are different from those of the fine earth of the soil cousin et al 2003 liao et al 2019 in this case using the 12 ptfs to predict the properties of soils with high rock fragment contents table 1 may cause the bias in predictions the defect of the model structure was another reason of the prediction bias daycent and dndc are good at simulate the n cycle since classic laws of physics chemistry and biology have been incorporated in the models to parameterize the biogeochemical reaction but sometimes perform poorly in capturing soil hydrological processes since both models are based on the simple cascade approach instead of the richards equation kröebel et al 2010 coupling the n biogeochemistry models with more complex soil hydrology models e g hydrus based on the richards equation may be an effective way to solve the deficits of daycent and dndc kraus et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 after lbc the rmses of the ensemble mean decreased remarkably fig 10 the performances of the ebc when ptfs were used in both models were better than those when ptfs used in each model this indicates that ebc can yield the best results when both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were included which is related to the strongest correlation between the measured n o 3 n concentrations and the ensemble means obtained by combining 2 models and 12 ptfs fig 9 previous studies also found that the larger number of ensemble members can result in the more comprehensive interpretation of model uncertainty krishnamurti et al 2000 palmer et al 2004 the premise of the use of multiple source simulation systems is based on the hypothesis that we do not know which independent model is the best in advance in other words all models contribute to the ensemble this hypothesis is supported by previous studies for example abdalla et al 2010 found that the daycent model effectively estimated the n emissions and biomass production from the irish grasslands compared with the dndc model however wu and zhang 2014 observed that the dndc model performed better than the daycent model for simulating n emissions from paddy fields the various conclusions suggest that the performance of the model may be related to the site conditions such as climate soil and land use unfortunately using combinations of individual forecasts did not create predictors with excellent performance due to the systematic bias although lbc was performed the ensemble mean only accounted for the first moment mean of the data not the second moment spread of the values therefore the nonlinear bias correction technique which has the ability to bring the variance of the ensemble means closer to that of the measured values can be a promising tool for future research 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty in the simulated leachate n o 3 n concentrations and evaluated the ensemble mean and ebc methods for reducing the model uncertainty on a tea garden hillslope in taihu lake basin china through our results we found that both the ptf prediction and model structural uncertainty were equally important in soil n o 3 n leaching modelling the ensemble mean failed to deal with the model uncertainty due to a large bias in the simulated leachate n o 3 n concentrations by using ptfs the performances of the ensemble mean were substantially improved after lbc showing that the rmses of the ebc were 4 30 5 72 5 50 and 5 93 mg l 1 when ptfs were used in both models at the top upper middle and lower slope positions respectively overall our findings indicated that the ebc was a viable approach for simulating n o 3 n leaching in soils

10604,climate change is altering agricultural production conditions adaptation measures to reduce negative impacts of climate change and utilize emerging potentials may involve the increased use of irrigation water with increased irrigation water consumption water use conflicts and resource constraints may occur and aggravate under climate change estimates of expected changes in irrigation water demands are of great value to anticipate if and where such issues may arise this study presents an analysis of projected changes in irrigation water demand and grain yield of maize subject to variation in cultivar choice sowing dates soil depth and texture as well as climate projection uncertainty and crop model parameterization uncertainty study results suggest that varietal choice opens up a large scope for adaptation of future grain maize productivity with important implications for agricultural water use assuming that no mitigation measures are taken rcp8 5 the cultivation of late maturing varieties in combination with earlier sowing can be considered a suitable adaptation choice even allowing for increasing yield levels until mid century however with this adaptation choice irrigation water demands could be expected to increase by up to 40 until the end of the century while absolute estimates of irrigation water demands are strongly dependent on soil depth and to a much smaller degree on soil texture change signals of irrigation water demands were largely unaffected by variation in soil parameters however estimates of future changes in irrigation water demands are subject to large uncertainties originating from climate projection uncertainties implying possible increases in irrigation water demands between 10 and 60 increases in irrigation water demands could be constrained by cultivating early maturing varieties at the expense of lower production potentials selection and breeding efforts steered towards early varieties with extended grain filling duration may help to increase yield potentials keywords climate change irrigation varieties sowing soil parameters uncertainty management adaptation 1 introduction climate change is altering agricultural production conditions increasing temperatures have various implications for plant growth and crop productivity warmer temperatures lead to an extension of the growing season potentially benefitting agricultural productivity especially in temperate regions of the world where growth temperatures for many crops are currently below optimum and water limitations play a minor role however increasing frequencies of heat and drought extremes are expected to have detrimental effects on agricultural productivity also in temperate regions of europe e g olesen et al 2011 žalud et al 2017 mäkinen et al 2018 grillakis 2019 possible measures of agricultural adaptation to prevent negative impacts of climate change and utilize emerging potentials are changes in cultivars crops and increased use of irrigation water bindi and olesen 2011 it can be expected that farmers will take appropriate actions autonomously provided they have access to required resources e g financial means to invest in irrigation infrastructure access to water resources knowledge of suitable crops cultivars and farming techniques access to adapted seeds and technical equipment leclère et al 2013 in most european countries especially northern europe adaptive capacity is considered to be and remain high iglesias and garrote 2015 reidsma et al 2009 williges et al 2017 as farmers adapt their management in response to changing climate and other drivers negative environmental impacts may be aggravated and or resource conflicts might emerge for example negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and water quality may be aggravated by management adaptations supporting agricultural productivity papadimitriou et al 2019 increased abstractions of irrigation water from groundwater sources may lower the groundwater levels with possible negative implications on drinking water availability and quality neset et al 2019 crop growth models fed with climate projection data from global and regional climate models are common tools for anticipating climate change impacts on crop productivity and changes in irrigation water demands for estimating emerging threats of maladaptation such models can be applied on the basis of varying assumptions about possible management adaptations if evaluated in combination with a range of climate projections the benefits of alternative adaptation options for securing productivity and estimate future water demands can be assessed by matching changing water demands with changes in resource availabilities emerging water use conflicts can be anticipated on the basis of such study findings regulations and incentive systems may be adapted to prevent possibly emerging maladaptive responses to climate change many previous studies analyzed current and future water demands for irrigation in europe and at the global scale e g wriedt et al 2009 schaldach et al 2012 boehlert et al 2015 konzmann et al 2013 projected changes can differ substantially between studies for the swiss rhone valley smith et al 2014 estimated increases in irrigation water demands of 15 for grassland and 30 for grain until mid century subject to large climate projection uncertainties even after bias corrections in a regional evaluation fuhrer et al 2014 estimated an increase of irrigation water demands by 4 16 in the swiss rhone valley until 2050 discrepancies in projected changes can be attributed to structural impact model uncertainties climate projection and downscaling uncertainties as well as differences in crop choice and underlying assumptions about varieties management and site conditions i e soil parameters systematic studies of uncertainty sources contributing to projection uncertainty in changing irrigation water demands have recently been conducted by elliott et al 2014 and webber et al 2016 elliott et al 2014 compare ensembles of water supply and demand projections on the basis of 10 global hydrological models and six gridded crop models webber et al 2016 explored the effects of structural model uncertainties i e variation in model components on estimates of maize crop water use and risk of crop failure such projection uncertainties imply decision risks for adaptation planning if more water is required existing irrigation infrastructure may not be sufficient to provide the required amounts of water or water resources may be overused with negative implications on the environment and other water users besides consideration of impact model uncertainties recent studies have also called for the inclusion of multiple varieties when estimating impacts of climate change on crop productivity accounting for the possibility of climate change adaptation efforts e g rezaei et al 2018 parent et al 2018 this study presents an extensive uncertainty analysis of projected changes in irrigation water demand and grain yield of maize cultivated in switzerland considering climate projection and crop parameterization uncertainty while accounting for regional variation in soil texture and depths and possible shifts in sowing dates varietal choice the following research questions are addressed what impacts of climate change on crop productivity and irrigation water demands do we have to expect how do projected impacts vary depending on shifts in varietal selection and sowing dates how do projected impacts vary with soil depth and texture what are main sources of uncertainties in projected changes the study results add to the understanding of key drivers of change and provide relevant information for robust decision making in context with climate change adaptation planning in switzerland 2 study region the study is conducted in the south western part of the swiss central plateau with the station of payerne being the reference site for our considerations of climate change impacts in this region fig 1 due to its favourable pedo climatic conditions this region is important for agricultural production in switzerland bfs 2012 holzkämper 2015b considering impacts of climate change on crop productivity at the global scale great production losses estimated for tropical and sub tropical regions benefits in northern latitudes it is possible that swiss agricultural production may gain importance in an international context in the future however this region is also regularly experiencing drought limitations today holzkämper et al 2015b and these limitations are expected to increase with future climate change klein et al 2014 autonomous adaptation is on the way through the formation of irrigation cooperatives also large irrigation infrastructure developments are being established in the region to prevent maladaptive responses e g resource exploitation water use conflicts information on likely changes in irrigation water demand is essential for this region in particular 3 method the generic crop model cropsyst version 4 13 09 stöckle et al 2003 has been applied in this study cropsyst simulates daily biomass accumulation in response to soil climate and management drivers daily biomass growth is calculated as the minimum between radiation dependent growth monteith 1977 and transpiration dependent growth tanner and sinclair 1983 transpiration dependent growth can be limited by soil water availability to estimate plant water uptake the soil profile is divided into multiple layers the uptake from each layer is estimated on the basis of the water potential difference between the soil and the plant xylem multiplied by plant conductance mainly determined by root conductance soil water dynamics are simulated based on the daily cascade approach implemented in cropsyst stöckle and nelson 2000 within this study cropsyst was applied on the basis of a crop parameterizations for grain maize from holzkömper et al 2015c calibrated using the procedure described in klein et al 2012 to allow for the quantification of crop parameterization uncertainty 9 parameter sets produced based on the stochastic calibration routine were used here parameter values of the 9 parameter sets can be found in the supplementary material the crop model estimates were validated based on recent statistical yield data for the period 2009 2017 confirming satisfactory performance for the simulation of grain maize yield levels and variability willmott index of 0 65 0 14 see supplementary for full list of performance metrics to account for possibilities of varietal adaptation growing degree day gdd requirements to reach flowering were adapted in accordance with findings about variations in cycle duration across europe by parent et al 2018 who found that thermal time to flowering varied between 700 and 1200 due to genetic variation amongst 121 maize accessions for this study gdd s to reach the beginning of flowering 900 in the parameterization from holzkämper et al 2015c were therefore adjusted by 200 to represent early and late maturing varieties respectively gdd requirements to reach the beginning of flowering were 700 for the early variety 900 for the medium variety and 1100 for the late variety to reach maturity 1650 gdds were required for the early variety 1850 for the medium variety and 2050 for the late variety with this we assume to represent a realistic range of varietal differences in lengths of vegetative phases within europe under current climatic conditions the range of sowing dates in switzerland varies largely between mid april and mid june hiltbrunner et al 2014 hiltbrunner et al 2016 hiltbrunner et al 2018 therefore may 10th doy 130 can be regarded as a suitable sowing date under current climatic conditions shifts towards earlier dates are considered realistic as possible adaptations to climate change based on these assumptions the following sowing dates were selected to be tested in this study doy 70 march 11th 100 april 10th 130 may 10th automatic irrigation was specified to be triggered based on soil water depletion 0 5 maximum allowable depletion the period of potential irrigation was defined in relation to phenological development from the beginning of active growth to the onset of yield formation if irrigation was triggered between 15 and 25 mm of irrigation water were applied per day to refill soil water content to maximum capacity to account for regional variation in soil conditions in this study six different soil profiles were defined based on nabo soil profile data nabodat 2018 three texture types sandy loam silt loam and clay loam with two soil depths 70 and 120 cm and an organic matter content fixed at 4 5 in the top layer the three selected soil texture types are within the medium range of observed conditions in nabodat 2018 the selected soil depth levels relate to the 60th and 95th percentiles of recorded usable soil depths recorded across switzerland nabodat 2018 they are indicative for soils with high to very high suitability for arable farming full information on texture parameters in all sublayers assumed for this study is summarized in table 1 climate projection data was derived from ch2018 2018 where euro cordex projection data had been statistically downscaled using the quantile mapping approach to preserve the daily granularity and transient nature of the native rcm simulations throughout the common simulation period 1981 2100 a subset of six downscaled gcm rcm model chains were chosen from the ch2018 scenario dataset table 2 the selection was based on the daily availability of all required meteorological parameters temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and radiation only projections of emission pathway rcp 8 5 no climate mitigation were selected to study impacts greatest possible increases in irrigation water demands here the full simulation ensemble thus accounts for two types of projection uncertainty i e climate projection uncertainty and crop model parameterization uncertainty two aspects of spatial variability in soil properties i e soil texture and depth and two adaptation options i e choice of variety and sowing date see fig 2 overall variance in simulated grain maize yields and irrigation water requirements estimated with this simulation ensemble was attributed to the factors shown in fig 2 using anova based variance partitioning as previously done in yip et al 2011 or holzkämper et al 2015c in this procedure sums of squares as derived with the anova are divided by the total sum of squares to result in the proportions of explained variances in simulation outputs that can be attributed to the different model inputs only single factors and no interactive effects were considered here all interactive effects are thus summarized as residuals the effects of interannual climate variability on simulation outputs were averaged out by conducting the variance partitioning based on 20 year mean yields and seasonal irrigation amounts all statistical analyses were conducted using r r core team 2019 4 results 4 1 irrigated yields projections of the whole ensemble suggest that estimated yield levels vary substantially variation by 4 6 t ha fig 3 the variance is mostly attributed to the choice of variety and crop model parameterization the contribution of climate projection uncertainty to variation in estimated yield levels is relatively small however the contribution of climate projection uncertainty is larger when looking at relative yield changes fig 4 it is the largest source of uncertainty over the first two decades of the time series suggesting a possibility of both small positive and negative yield changes in this period in the near future the choice of cultivar contributes increasingly to the variance in estimated yield changes adding almost 20 variation by the end of the century the choice of sowing date contributes increasingly to the variation in yield change signal with a maximum contribution of about 15 by the end of the century fig 4 however this has to be seen in relation to fig 3 which shows that the amount of variation in yield levels explained by shifts in sowing dates is reduced to almost 0 within the first few decades of the simulation period this shows that the increased contribution to variance in yield changes originates from differences in reference yield levels due to shifts in sowing dates crop model parameter uncertainty plays a minor role for yield change signals with a maximum contribution of 2 by the end of the century fig 4 variation in soil depth and soil texture is insignificant both for projected yield levels and yield change signals figs 3 and 4 4 2 irrigation water demands ensemble estimates of seasonal irrigation water vary widely between 120 and 320 mm fig 5 the uncertainty increases slightly towards the end of the century mostly attributed to climate projection uncertainty the largest part of variance in estimated irrigation water demand originates from the choice of variety over the whole simulation period choice of sowing date plays a minor role but its contribution to variance in estimated seasonal irrigation needs increases slightly towards the end of the century soil parametrization and in particular soil depth contributes considerably to variation in seasonal irrigation estimates 50 mm crop model parametrization uncertainty contributes constantly but little to overall variation 30 mm variance in projected changes in irrigation water demands is clearly dominated by climate model projection uncertainty fig 6 during the first few decades of the simulation period a slight decrease in irrigation water demands is suggested by the median of the distribution while a steady increase is suggested for the second half of the century however these estimates are subject to very large climate projection uncertainties and from 2020 onwards also choice of sowing and variety contribute increasingly to variation in estimated changes in irrigation water demands variation in soil depth and texture is found to play a negligible role for estimates of changes in irrigation water demands 4 3 scope for adaptation through choice of variety and sowing dates in depth analysis of simulation results for the three different varieties and three sowing dates considered in this study highlights the high sensitivity of estimated yield change signals to the choice of varieties and sowing dates fig 7 overall estimated yield levels are largest with the late variety and lowest with the early variety yield levels estimated for the early variety are projected to decrease largely irrespective of the selected sowing date fig 7 projections of the late variety suggest a possibility of increasing yields the yield increase is most pronounced with late sowing as under these conditions yield levels of the late variety are severely limited by the fact that thermal conditions during early decades of the simulation period often prevent full maturity however projection uncertainties are large mostly attributable to crop model parameterization towards the end of the century the risk of a yield decrease is also slightly increasing with the late variety and early sowing with the medium variety the crop model projects a small increase with late sowing s130 with increasing uncertainty towards the end of the century suggesting also a possibility of yield decline with earlier sowing s70 s100 the model projects stagnating yields until mid century and a small and a decline thereafter until the end of century variation in soil depth and texture contributes most to variance in estimated yield levels for the early variety less so for the medium variety and has hardly any influence on variance in estimated yield levels for the late variety this can be explained by the fact that for the early variety the grain filling period during which irrigation water is no longer applied is more likely to fall within the period of limited water availability this water stress is limiting yields of the early variety more severely on the shallow soil than on the deeper soil irrigation water demands are projected to increase most for the late variety with late sowing 39 median increase until end of century fig 8 for the early variety irrigation water demands tend to decrease or remain stable during the simulation period with early and medium sowing dates with late sowing a slight tendency towards an increase in irrigation water demands is noticeable for the early variety 10 until end of century for the medium variety irrigation water demands are projected to remain stable with early and medium sowing dates but increase with late sowing 20 until end of century this increase in irrigation water demands with late sowing is connected to the fact that later sowing shifts the growing cycle further into the summer period during with water limitations are more frequent climate projection uncertainty plays a similar role in projections for all variety and sowing dates as also shown in fig 5 climate projection uncertainty contributes around 15 to variation in estimated irrigation water demands during the first half of the simulation period increasing to 26 towards the end of the century crop parameterization uncertainty only plays a considerable role for projections of irrigation water demands of the late variety at maximum 20 for the early and medium varieties the contribution is 1 3 at maximum in contrast to simulated grain yields simulated irrigation water demands are more strongly affected by soil depths the contribution of soil depth to variation in estimated irrigation water demands is largely constant over the simulation periods and independent of variety and sowing dates between 0 7 and 6 at maximum the contribution of soil texture differences to variations in irrigation water demands is negligible between 1 and 2 4 at maximum irrigation water productivity defined as the ratio between produced yield and applied irrigation water is generally highest for the early variety and lowest for the late variety fig 9 over the course of the simulation only minor trends are visible for the early variety mostly attributable to shifts in sowing dates with early sowing a slight increase in irrigation water productivity is projected while with late sowing a decrease is projected this can be explained by the fact that with earlier sowing the growing cycle is shifted towards a period of the year with lower water limitations while with later sowing the dependency on irrigation water inputs is increased 5 discussion 5 1 changes in grain maize yield levels a previous study by webber et al 2018 suggested that european maize yields are likely to decrease under climate change if current genotypes and mix of irrigated and rainfed production would persist in accordance with findings of the european study by parent et al 2018 and zimmermann et al 2017 and the recent global meta analysis by aggarwal et al 2019 our study results now confirm for switzerland that yield potentials for grain maize could increase under climate change if adaptation is considered i e irrigation adapted sowing dates and growing cycles length the late variety had generally higher yield potentials than earlier varieties due to the extended growing cycle which allows for the accumulation of more biomass see supplementary material for more information on projected changes in growing cycle length this beneficial effect is likely to lead to an increase in irrigated yield potentials until mid century shifts in sowing date were found to matter less for estimated yields than varietal changes in this study earlier sowing is beneficial for crop productivity during the first half of the century but the beneficial effect is diminished towards the end of the century this can be explained by the fact that with early sowing the risk of yield loss through unsuccessful maturation which is relatively high during the first few decades of the simulation period especially for the late variety can be reduced since this risk is generally reduced with increasing temperatures towards the end of the century the beneficial effect of earlier sowing on productivity is reduced with increasing projection horizon this might imply a possibility for cultivating even later maturing varieties which could be explored in future studies variation in soil depth and texture was found to play a small role for absolute irrigated yield estimates and an even smaller role for estimated yield changes for rain fed yields however stronger impacts of texture and in particular soil depth could be expected as the available water content is strongly influenced by soil parameterization e g constantin et al 2019 the considerable contribution of climate projection uncertainty for estimates of yield change signals is not surprising and largely in line with findings from previous studies for example finger et al 2011 estimated positive and negative changes subject to climate projection uncertainty holzkämper et al 2015a found that yield change estimates for grain maize in switzerland were subject to large uncertainties originating from both climate projection uncertainty and structural impact model uncertainty knox et al 2016 who provided a meta analysis of climate impacts on yields in europe also highlights that uncertainties in projected yield changes are large the influence of crop parametrization uncertainty on absolute yield estimates was found to be large here figs 3 and 7 this finding is likely to be specific to this case study as a previous study with a similar design by tao et al 2017 found that contributions of crop model parameterization and climate projection to total variance of ensemble outputs varied greatly among different crop models and also between sites given the availability of adequate data future research aiming at refinements of crop model parameters might help to reduce this uncertainty source 5 2 changes in irrigation water demands for grain maize in line with findings from previous studies at european level webber et al 2016 estimates of changes in irrigation water demands for grain maize were shown to be subject to large uncertainties originating mostly from climate projections in this study estimates of up to 40 increases in irrigation water demands by the end of the century are largely within the range of estimates previous studies for example wada et al 2013 estimated that irrigation water demands will considerably increase during the summer in the northern hemisphere 20 by 2100 under the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp8 5 for the swiss rhone valley smith et al 2014 estimated increases in irrigation water demands of 15 for grassland and 30 for grain maize until mid century subject to large climate projection uncertainties even after bias corrections in a regional evaluation fuhrer et al 2014 estimated an increase of irrigation water demands by 4 16 in the swiss rhone valley until 2050 unlike these studies our study suggests also possibilities of decreasing demands for irrigation water with some climate projections this is most pronounced with model chain knmi racmo hadgem eur44 but also apparent in smhi rca miroc eur44 in these model chains a high increase in temperature is projected in combination with an insignificant change in precipitation annual and summer with that water limitations are generally reduced due to the shortened growing cycle with increased temperatures and smaller precipitation deficits in general according to the ensemble medians with late sowing irrigation water demands could be expected to increase by 10 20 and 30 for early medium and late maturing varieties respectively with early sowing irrigation water demands are projected to decrease by 22 and 11 for the early and late varieties respectively and remain unchanged for the late variety the effect of reduced water demands with accelerated phenological development that was identified here had also been documented in previous studies e g yuan et al 2016 rashid et al 2019 such findings imply a possibility for limiting future crop water demands through adaptations of the growing cycle selecting for longer grain filling duration amongst early maize varieties could support the breeding of new early maturing varieties with higher yield potentials e g gasura et al 2014 in response to increasing co2 concentrations irrigation water demands may be lower than estimated in this study this can be expected since it is generally assumed that transpiration rates decrease with increasing co2 concentrations as leaf stomatal conductance is suppressed in the german face experiment by manderscheid et al 2014 it was found that maize water use efficiency can increase substantially with increased co2 concentrations under drought conditions this increase in water use efficiency can however be alleviated under irrigated conditions as found by meng et al 2014 also at the plant and canopy level an increase in leaf area as a result of stimulated biomass growth at elevated co2 concentrations could compensate the reduction in leaf level transpiration manderscheid et al 2016 due to complex interactions involved in crop responses to elevated co2 concentrations which are currently not well understood projections of responses to future co2 levels are still highly uncertain e g durand et al 2018 kellner et al 2019 further experimental studies of crop responses with regard to yield but also water use root development phenology to elevated co2 in interaction with other factors is essential to reduce this projection uncertainty for this study specifications of irrigation management were chosen in alignment with suggested defaults to quantify potential crop irrigation demands they do not reflect realistic management settings different specifications would result in different absolute estimates of yield and irrigation water demands further research could explore how irrigation schedules could be optimized to achieve maximum irrigation water productivity 5 3 scope for adaptation through choice of variety and sowing dates despite considerable uncertainties results presented in this study clearly suggest that the cultivation of late maturing varieties of grain maize could benefit grain maize productivity under climate change until mid century yield potentials could be increased on the basis of such varietal adaptations and production potentials could largely be maintained until end of century given a steady increase in the supply of irrigation water in general the cultivation of late maturing varieties implies higher irrigation water demands as the growth cycle is extended into the drought prone period of the year see supplementary material for more detailed information on projected changes in growing cycle length and seasonal transpiration by variety and sowing date given the higher yield potentials of these varieties it could be expected that farmers will choose to cultivate them if water resources for irrigation are available in sufficient amounts and at adequate costs in relation to the market prices to be achieved for grain maize while increased irrigation water application to prevent productivity losses under climate change is an adaptation measure with potential co benefits for other ecosystem services such as soil regulation nutrient cycling or carbon sequestration it also implies a risk of water resource exploitation and water use conflict based on global ensemble simulations of water supply and demand by elliott et al 2014 it was found that in regions such as europe surplus water supply could in principle support a net increase in irrigation although substantial investments in irrigation infrastructure would be required for switzerland it is expected that local and regional water shortages will become more likely under climate changes as low summer discharge will coincide with higher water demands for irrigation brunner et al 2019 thereby the greatest water limitations for irrigation are expected in the south western part of the swiss central plateau where the city of payerne is located natural lakes may serve as alternative sources of irrigation water where river discharge is limited integrated modelling studies considering linkages between plant growth agricultural water demands and water resource availability are suitable to study such questions of water use conflicts in depth however large alternative irrigation water resources such as natural lakes may not be equally accessible in all arable regions with a high and ever increasing production potential one possibility identified in this study could lie in the cultivation of early maturing varieties such varieties would be preferable due to their ability to reach maturity or pass drought sensitive phenological phases before seasonal water deficits occur this effect of drought avoidance is supported by shifts towards earlier sowing dates early sowing provides benefits for irrigation water productivity in general irrespective of varieties both these options could imply additional benefits in terms of heat stress avoidance an effect that is not accounted for in cropsyst which management options future farmers will choose depends not on climate conditions alone market prices costs and agricultural policies will have important influences on future farming systems considering projected climate change impacts on agricultural production potentials at the global scale which suggest a general potential of production increases in the temperate regions it may be anticipated that the relevance of agricultural production may increase rather than decrease in these regions intensification of agricultural management may follow from such socio economic change this could lead to extension of irrigation area and increased abstraction rates not only to satisfy increasing water demands of presently cultivated crops but also for the cultivation of new water intensive crops with high added value e g fruits and vegetables to prevent exploitation of water resources negative impacts on aquatic biodiversity and limit water use conflicts under scenarios of agricultural intensification detailed studies on the future vulnerability of regional water resources to irrigation water abstractions are needed varieties recommended for switzerland correspond largely to early medium varieties considered in this study however during the warm years of 2017 18 a tendency towards later maturing varieties was observed which supports the findings of this study hiltbrunner personal communication strigens personal communication current sowing practices favor rather late sowing between mid april and mid june according to results presented here earlier sowing could be beneficial in terms of water productivity gains and better utilization of growing season already under current conditions however suboptimal soil temperatures during this early period of the year could prevent a good plant establishment during early growth stages and increase weed pressure and the plants susceptibility to pest and diseases hiltbrunner personal communication such effects were not accounted for in this study and should be investigated in more detail in future studies 6 conclusions it was demonstrated that a large scope for adaptations of future grain maize yield productivity in switzerland exists through varietal choices available in europe today impacts of climate change on changes in grain maize yields and irrigation water demands depend strongly on varietal choices and are also influenced by the choice of sowing dates for early maturing grain maize varieties yield declines would have to be expected under climate change assuming that no mitigation measures were taken rcp8 5 under these conditions the cultivation of late maturing varieties in combination with earlier sowing can be considered a suitable adaptation choice to prevent yield declines for grain maize which would even allow for increasing yield levels until mid century however with this adaptation choice irrigation water demands could be expected to increase by up to 40 until the end of the century while absolute estimates of irrigation water demands were strongly dependent on soil depth and to a much smaller degree on soil texture change signals of irrigation water demands were largely unaffected by variation in soil parameters however estimates of future changes in irrigation water demands are subject to large uncertainties originating from climate projection uncertainties implying possible increases in irrigation water demands between 10 and 60 increases in irrigation water demands could be constrained by cultivating early maturing varieties at the expense of lower production potentials selection

10604,climate change is altering agricultural production conditions adaptation measures to reduce negative impacts of climate change and utilize emerging potentials may involve the increased use of irrigation water with increased irrigation water consumption water use conflicts and resource constraints may occur and aggravate under climate change estimates of expected changes in irrigation water demands are of great value to anticipate if and where such issues may arise this study presents an analysis of projected changes in irrigation water demand and grain yield of maize subject to variation in cultivar choice sowing dates soil depth and texture as well as climate projection uncertainty and crop model parameterization uncertainty study results suggest that varietal choice opens up a large scope for adaptation of future grain maize productivity with important implications for agricultural water use assuming that no mitigation measures are taken rcp8 5 the cultivation of late maturing varieties in combination with earlier sowing can be considered a suitable adaptation choice even allowing for increasing yield levels until mid century however with this adaptation choice irrigation water demands could be expected to increase by up to 40 until the end of the century while absolute estimates of irrigation water demands are strongly dependent on soil depth and to a much smaller degree on soil texture change signals of irrigation water demands were largely unaffected by variation in soil parameters however estimates of future changes in irrigation water demands are subject to large uncertainties originating from climate projection uncertainties implying possible increases in irrigation water demands between 10 and 60 increases in irrigation water demands could be constrained by cultivating early maturing varieties at the expense of lower production potentials selection and breeding efforts steered towards early varieties with extended grain filling duration may help to increase yield potentials keywords climate change irrigation varieties sowing soil parameters uncertainty management adaptation 1 introduction climate change is altering agricultural production conditions increasing temperatures have various implications for plant growth and crop productivity warmer temperatures lead to an extension of the growing season potentially benefitting agricultural productivity especially in temperate regions of the world where growth temperatures for many crops are currently below optimum and water limitations play a minor role however increasing frequencies of heat and drought extremes are expected to have detrimental effects on agricultural productivity also in temperate regions of europe e g olesen et al 2011 žalud et al 2017 mäkinen et al 2018 grillakis 2019 possible measures of agricultural adaptation to prevent negative impacts of climate change and utilize emerging potentials are changes in cultivars crops and increased use of irrigation water bindi and olesen 2011 it can be expected that farmers will take appropriate actions autonomously provided they have access to required resources e g financial means to invest in

countries especially northern europe adaptive capacity is considered to be and remain high iglesias and garrote 2015 reidsma et al 2009 williges et al 2017 as farmers adapt their management in response to changing climate and other drivers negative environmental impacts may be aggravated and or resource conflicts might emerge for example negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and water quality may be aggravated by management adaptations supporting agricultural productivity papadimitriou et al 2019 increased abstractions of irrigation water from groundwater sources may lower the groundwater levels with possible negative implications on drinking water availability and quality neset et al 2019 crop growth models fed with climate projection data from global and regional climate models are common tools for anticipating climate change impacts on crop productivity and changes in irrigation water demands for estimating emerging threats of maladaptation such models can be applied on the basis of varying assumptions about possible management adaptations if evaluated in combination with a range of climate projections the benefits of alternative adaptation options for securing productivity and estimate future water demands can be assessed by matching changing water demands with changes in resource availabilities emerging water use conflicts can be anticipated on the basis of such study findings regulations and incentive systems may be adapted to prevent possibly emerging maladaptive responses to climate change many previous studies analyzed current and future water demands for irrigation in europe and at the global scale e g wriedt et al 2009 schaldach et al 2012 boehlert et al 2015 konzmann et al 2013 projected changes can differ substantially between studies for the swiss rhone valley smith et al 2014 estimated increases in irrigation water demands of 15 for grassland and 30 for grain until mid century subject to large climate projection uncertainties even after bias corrections in a regional evaluation fuhrer et al 2014 estimated an increase of irrigation water demands by 4 16 in the swiss rhone valley until 2050 discrepancies in projected changes can be attributed to structural impact model uncertainties climate projection and downscaling uncertainties as well as differences in crop choice and underlying assumptions about varieties management and site conditions i e soil parameters systematic studies of uncertainty sources contributing to projection uncertainty in changing irrigation water demands have recently been conducted by elliott et al 2014 and webber et al 2016 elliott et al 2014 compare ensembles of water supply and demand projections on the basis of 10 global hydrological models and six gridded crop models webber et al 2016 explored the effects of structural model uncertainties i e variation in model components on estimates of maize crop water use and risk of crop failure such projection uncertainties imply decision risks for adaptation planning if more water is required existing irrigation infrastructure may not be sufficient to provide the required amounts of water or water resources may be overused with negative implications on the environment and other water users besides consideration of impact model uncertainties recent studies have also called for the inclusion of multiple varieties when estimating impacts of climate change on crop productivity accounting for the possibility of climate change adaptation efforts e g rezaei et al 2018 parent et al 2018 this study presents an extensive uncertainty analysis of projected changes in irrigation water demand and grain yield of maize cultivated in switzerland considering climate projection and crop parameterization uncertainty while accounting for regional variation in soil texture and depths and possible shifts in sowing dates varietal choice the following research questions are addressed what impacts of climate change on crop productivity and irrigation water demands do we have to expect how do projected impacts vary depending on shifts in varietal selection and sowing dates how do projected impacts vary with soil depth and texture what are main sources of uncertainties in projected changes the study results add to the understanding of key drivers of change and provide relevant information for robust decision making in context with climate change adaptation planning in switzerland 2 study region the study is conducted in the south western part of the swiss central plateau with the station of payerne being the reference site for our considerations of climate change impacts in this region fig 1 due to its favourable pedo climatic conditions this region is important for agricultural production in switzerland bfs 2012 holzkämper 2015b considering impacts of climate change on crop productivity at the global scale great production losses estimated for tropical and sub tropical regions benefits in northern latitudes it is possible that swiss agricultural production may gain importance in an international context in the future however this region is also regularly experiencing drought limitations today holzkämper et al 2015b and these limitations are expected to increase with future climate change klein et al 2014 autonomous adaptation is on the way through the formation of irrigation cooperatives also large irrigation infrastructure developments are being established in the region to prevent maladaptive responses e g resource exploitation water use conflicts information on likely changes in irrigation water demand is essential for this region in particular 3 method the generic crop model cropsyst version 4 13 09 stöckle et al 2003 has been applied in this study cropsyst simulates daily biomass accumulation in response to soil climate and management drivers daily biomass growth is calculated as the minimum between radiation dependent growth monteith 1977 and transpiration dependent growth tanner and sinclair 1983 transpiration dependent growth can be limited by soil water availability to estimate plant water uptake the soil profile is divided into multiple layers the uptake from each layer is estimated on the basis of the water potential difference between the soil and the plant xylem multiplied by plant conductance mainly determined by root conductance soil water dynamics are simulated based on the daily cascade approach implemented in cropsyst stöckle and nelson 2000 within this study cropsyst was applied on the basis of a crop parameterizations for grain maize from holzkömper et al 2015c calibrated using the procedure described in klein et al 2012 to allow for the quantification of crop parameterization uncertainty 9 parameter sets produced based on the stochastic calibration routine were used here parameter values of the 9 parameter sets can be found in the supplementary material the crop model estimates were validated based on recent statistical yield data for the period 2009 2017 confirming satisfactory performance for the simulation of grain maize yield levels and variability willmott index of 0 65 0 14 see supplementary for full list of performance metrics to account for possibilities of varietal adaptation growing degree day gdd requirements to reach flowering were adapted in accordance with findings about variations in cycle duration across europe by parent et al 2018 who found that thermal time to flowering varied between 700 and 1200 due to genetic variation amongst 121 maize accessions for this study gdd s to reach the beginning of flowering 900 in the parameterization from holzkämper et al 2015c were therefore adjusted by 200 to represent early and late maturing varieties respectively gdd requirements to reach the beginning of flowering were 700 for the early variety 900 for the medium variety and 1100 for the late variety to reach maturity 1650 gdds were required for the early variety 1850 for the medium variety and 2050 for the late variety with this we assume to represent a realistic range of varietal differences in lengths of vegetative phases within europe under current climatic conditions the range of sowing dates in switzerland varies largely between mid april and mid june hiltbrunner et al 2014 hiltbrunner et al 2016 hiltbrunner et al 2018 therefore may 10th doy 130 can be regarded as a suitable sowing date under current climatic conditions shifts towards earlier dates are considered realistic as possible adaptations to climate change based on these assumptions the following sowing dates were selected to be tested in this study doy 70 march 11th 100 april 10th 130 may 10th automatic irrigation was specified to be triggered based on soil water depletion 0 5 maximum allowable depletion the period of potential irrigation was defined in relation to phenological development from the beginning of active growth to the onset of yield formation if irrigation was triggered between 15 and 25 mm of irrigation water were applied per day to refill soil water content to maximum capacity to account for regional variation in soil conditions in this study six different soil profiles were defined based on nabo soil profile data nabodat 2018 three texture types sandy loam silt loam and clay loam with two soil depths 70 and 120 cm and an organic matter content fixed at 4 5 in the top layer the three selected soil texture types are within the medium range of observed conditions in nabodat 2018 the selected soil depth levels relate to the 60th and 95th percentiles of recorded usable soil depths recorded across switzerland nabodat 2018 they are indicative for soils with high to very high suitability for arable farming full information on texture parameters in all sublayers assumed for this study is summarized in table 1 climate projection data was derived from ch2018 2018 where euro cordex projection data had been statistically downscaled using the quantile mapping approach to preserve the daily granularity and transient nature of the native rcm simulations throughout the common simulation period 1981 2100 a subset of six downscaled gcm rcm model chains were chosen from the ch2018 scenario dataset table 2 the selection was based on the daily availability of all required meteorological parameters temperature precipitation relative humidity wind speed and radiation only projections of emission pathway rcp 8 5 no climate mitigation were selected to study impacts greatest possible increases in irrigation water demands here the full simulation ensemble thus accounts for two types of projection uncertainty i e climate projection uncertainty and crop model parameterization uncertainty two aspects of spatial variability in soil properties i e soil texture and depth and two adaptation options i e choice of variety and sowing date see fig 2 overall variance in simulated grain maize yields and irrigation water requirements estimated with this simulation ensemble was attributed to the factors shown in fig 2 using anova based variance partitioning as previously done in yip et al 2011 or holzkämper et al 2015c in this procedure sums of squares as derived with the anova are divided by the total sum of squares to result in the proportions of explained variances in simulation outputs that can be attributed to the different model inputs only single factors and no interactive effects were considered here all interactive effects are thus summarized as residuals the effects of interannual climate variability on simulation outputs were averaged out by conducting the variance partitioning based on 20 year mean yields and seasonal irrigation amounts all statistical analyses were conducted using r r core team 2019 4 results 4 1 irrigated yields projections of the whole ensemble suggest that estimated yield levels vary substantially variation by 4 6 t ha fig 3 the variance is mostly attributed to the choice of variety and crop model parameterization the contribution of climate projection uncertainty to variation in estimated yield levels is relatively small however the contribution of climate projection uncertainty is larger when looking at relative yield changes fig 4 it is the largest source of uncertainty over the first two decades of the time series suggesting a possibility of both small positive and negative yield changes in this period in the near future the choice of cultivar contributes increasingly to the variance in estimated yield changes adding almost 20 variation by the end of the century the choice of sowing date contributes increasingly to the variation in yield change signal with a maximum contribution of about 15 by the end of the century fig 4 however this has to be seen in relation to fig 3 which shows that the amount of variation in yield levels explained by shifts in sowing dates is reduced to almost 0 within the first few decades of the simulation period this shows that the increased contribution to variance in yield changes originates from differences in reference yield levels due to shifts in sowing dates crop model parameter uncertainty plays a minor role for yield change signals with a maximum contribution of 2 by the end of the century fig 4 variation in soil depth and soil texture is insignificant both for projected yield levels and yield change signals figs 3 and 4 4 2 irrigation water demands ensemble estimates of seasonal irrigation water vary widely between 120 and 320 mm fig 5 the uncertainty increases slightly towards the end of the century mostly attributed to climate projection uncertainty the largest part of variance in estimated irrigation water demand originates from the choice of variety over the whole simulation period choice of sowing date plays a minor role but its contribution to variance in estimated seasonal irrigation needs increases slightly towards the end of the century soil parametrization and in particular soil depth contributes considerably to variation in seasonal irrigation estimates 50 mm crop model parametrization uncertainty contributes constantly but little to overall variation 30 mm variance in projected changes in irrigation water demands is clearly dominated by climate model projection uncertainty fig 6 during the first few decades of the simulation period a slight decrease in irrigation water demands is suggested by the median of the distribution while a steady increase is suggested for the second half of the century however these estimates are subject to very large climate projection uncertainties and from 2020 onwards also choice of sowing and variety contribute increasingly to variation in estimated changes in irrigation water demands variation in soil depth and texture is found to play a negligible role for estimates of changes in irrigation water demands 4 3 scope for adaptation through choice of variety and sowing dates in depth analysis of simulation results for the three different varieties and three sowing dates considered in this study highlights the high sensitivity of estimated yield change signals to the choice of varieties and sowing dates fig 7 overall estimated yield levels are largest with the late variety and lowest with the early variety yield levels estimated for the early variety are projected to decrease largely irrespective of the selected sowing date fig 7 projections of the late variety suggest a possibility of increasing yields the yield increase is most pronounced with late sowing as under these conditions yield levels of the late variety are severely limited by the fact that thermal conditions during early decades of the simulation period often prevent full maturity however projection uncertainties are large mostly attributable to crop model parameterization towards the end of the century the risk of a yield decrease is also slightly increasing with the late variety and early sowing with the medium variety the crop model projects a small increase with late sowing s130 with increasing uncertainty towards the end of the century suggesting also a possibility of yield decline with earlier sowing s70 s100 the model projects stagnating yields until mid century and a small and a decline thereafter until the end of century variation in soil depth and texture contributes most to variance in estimated yield levels for the early variety less so for the medium variety and has hardly any influence on variance in estimated yield levels for the late variety this can be explained by the fact that for the early variety the grain filling period during which irrigation water is no longer applied is more likely to fall within the period of limited water availability this water stress is limiting yields of the early variety more severely on the shallow soil than on the deeper soil irrigation water demands are projected to increase most for the late variety with late sowing 39 median increase until end of century fig 8 for the early variety irrigation water demands tend to decrease or remain stable during the simulation period with early and medium sowing dates with late sowing a slight tendency towards an increase in irrigation water demands is noticeable for the early variety 10 until end of century for the medium variety irrigation water demands are projected to remain stable with early and medium sowing dates but increase with late sowing 20 until end of century this increase in irrigation water demands with late sowing is connected to the fact that later sowing shifts the growing cycle further into the summer period during with water limitations are more frequent climate projection uncertainty plays a similar role in projections for all variety and sowing dates as also shown in fig 5 climate projection uncertainty contributes around 15 to variation in estimated irrigation water demands during the first half of the simulation period increasing to 26 towards the end of the century crop parameterization uncertainty only plays a considerable role for projections of irrigation water demands of the late variety at maximum 20 for the early and medium varieties the contribution is 1 3 at maximum in contrast to simulated grain yields simulated irrigation water demands are more strongly affected by soil depths the contribution of soil depth to variation in estimated irrigation water demands is largely constant over the simulation periods and independent of variety and sowing dates between 0 7 and 6 at maximum the contribution of soil texture differences to variations in irrigation water demands is negligible between 1 and 2 4 at maximum irrigation water productivity defined as the ratio between produced yield and applied irrigation water is generally highest for the early variety and lowest for the late variety fig 9 over the course of the simulation only minor trends are visible for the early variety mostly attributable to shifts in sowing dates with early sowing a slight increase in irrigation water productivity is projected while with late sowing a decrease is projected this can be explained by the fact that with earlier sowing the growing cycle is shifted towards a period of the year with lower water limitations while with later sowing the dependency on irrigation water inputs is increased 5 discussion 5 1 changes in grain maize yield levels a previous study by webber et al 2018 suggested that european maize yields are likely to decrease under climate change if current genotypes and mix of irrigated and rainfed production would persist in accordance with findings of the european study by parent et al 2018 and zimmermann et al 2017 and the recent global meta analysis by aggarwal et al 2019 our study results now confirm for switzerland that yield potentials for grain maize could increase under climate change if adaptation is considered i e irrigation adapted sowing dates and growing cycles length the late variety had generally higher yield potentials than earlier varieties due to the extended growing cycle which allows for the accumulation of more biomass see supplementary material for more information on projected changes in growing cycle length this beneficial effect is likely to lead to an increase in irrigated yield potentials until mid century shifts in sowing date were found to matter less for estimated yields than varietal changes in this study earlier sowing is beneficial for crop productivity during the first half of the century but the beneficial effect is diminished towards the end of the century this can be explained by the fact that with early sowing the risk of yield loss through unsuccessful maturation which is relatively high during the first few decades of the simulation period especially for the late variety can be reduced since this risk is generally reduced with increasing temperatures towards the end of the century the beneficial effect of earlier sowing on productivity is reduced with increasing projection horizon this might imply a possibility for cultivating even later maturing varieties which could be explored in future studies variation in soil depth and texture was found to play a small role for absolute irrigated yield estimates and an even smaller role for estimated yield changes for rain fed yields however stronger impacts of texture and in particular soil depth could be expected as the available water content is strongly influenced by soil parameterization e g constantin et al 2019 the considerable contribution of climate projection uncertainty for estimates of yield change signals is not surprising and largely in line with findings from previous studies for example finger et al 2011 estimated positive and negative changes subject to climate projection uncertainty holzkämper et al 2015a found that yield change estimates for grain maize in switzerland were subject to large uncertainties originating from both climate projection uncertainty and structural impact model uncertainty knox et al 2016 who provided a meta analysis of climate impacts on yields in europe also highlights that uncertainties in projected yield changes are large the influence of crop parametrization uncertainty on absolute yield estimates was found to be large here figs 3 and 7 this finding is likely to be specific to this case study as a previous study with a similar design by tao et al 2017 found that contributions of crop model parameterization and climate projection to total variance of ensemble outputs varied greatly among different crop models and also between sites given the availability of adequate data future research aiming at refinements of crop model parameters might help to reduce this uncertainty source 5 2 changes in irrigation water demands for grain maize in line with findings from previous studies at european level webber et al 2016 estimates of changes in irrigation water demands for grain maize were shown to be subject to large uncertainties originating mostly from climate projections in this study estimates of up to 40 increases in irrigation water demands by the end of the century are largely within the range of estimates previous studies for example wada et al 2013 estimated that irrigation water demands will considerably increase during the summer in the northern hemisphere 20 by 2100 under the highest greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp8 5 for the swiss rhone valley smith et al 2014 estimated increases in irrigation water demands of 15 for grassland and 30 for grain maize until mid century subject to large climate projection uncertainties even after bias corrections in a regional evaluation fuhrer et al 2014 estimated an increase of irrigation water demands by 4 16 in the swiss rhone valley until 2050 unlike these studies our study suggests also possibilities of decreasing demands for irrigation water with some climate projections this is most pronounced with model chain knmi racmo hadgem eur44 but also apparent in smhi rca miroc eur44 in these model chains a high increase in temperature is projected in combination with an insignificant change in precipitation annual and summer with that water limitations are generally reduced due to the shortened growing cycle with increased temperatures and smaller precipitation deficits in general according to the ensemble medians with late sowing irrigation water demands could be expected to increase by 10 20 and 30 for early medium and late maturing varieties respectively with early sowing irrigation water demands are projected to decrease by 22 and 11 for the early and late varieties respectively and remain unchanged for the late variety the effect of reduced water demands with accelerated phenological development that was identified here had also been documented in previous studies e g yuan et al 2016 rashid et al 2019 such findings imply a possibility for limiting future crop water demands through adaptations of the growing cycle selecting for longer grain filling duration amongst early maize varieties could support the breeding of new early maturing varieties with higher yield potentials e g gasura et al 2014 in response to increasing co2 concentrations irrigation water demands may be lower than estimated in this study this can be expected since it is generally assumed that transpiration rates decrease with increasing co2 concentrations as leaf stomatal conductance is suppressed in the german face experiment by manderscheid et al 2014 it was found that maize water use efficiency can increase substantially with increased co2 concentrations under drought conditions this increase in water use efficiency can however be alleviated under irrigated conditions as found by meng et al 2014 also at the plant and canopy level an increase in leaf area as a result of stimulated biomass growth at elevated co2 concentrations could compensate the reduction in leaf level transpiration manderscheid et al 2016 due to complex interactions involved in crop responses to elevated co2 concentrations which are currently not well understood projections of responses to future co2 levels are still highly uncertain e g durand et al 2018 kellner et al 2019 further experimental studies of crop responses with regard to yield but also water use root development phenology to elevated co2 in interaction with other factors is essential to reduce this projection uncertainty for this study specifications of irrigation management were chosen in alignment with suggested defaults to quantify potential crop irrigation demands they do not reflect realistic management settings different specifications would result in different absolute estimates of yield and irrigation water demands further research could explore how irrigation schedules could be optimized to achieve maximum irrigation water productivity 5 3 scope for adaptation through choice of variety and sowing dates despite considerable uncertainties results presented in this study clearly suggest that the cultivation of late maturing varieties of grain maize could benefit grain maize productivity under climate change until mid century yield potentials could be increased on the basis of such varietal adaptations and production potentials could largely be maintained until end of century given a steady increase in the supply of irrigation water in general the cultivation of late maturing varieties implies higher irrigation water demands as the growth cycle is extended into the drought prone period of the year see supplementary material for more detailed information on projected changes in growing cycle length and seasonal transpiration by variety and sowing date given the higher yield potentials of these varieties it could be expected that farmers will choose to cultivate them if water resources for irrigation are available in sufficient amounts and at adequate costs in relation to the market prices to be achieved for grain maize while increased irrigation water application to prevent productivity losses under climate change is an adaptation measure with potential co benefits for other ecosystem services such as soil regulation nutrient cycling or carbon sequestration it also implies a risk of water resource exploitation and water use conflict based on global ensemble simulations of water supply and demand by elliott et al 2014 it was found that in regions such as europe surplus water supply could in principle support a net increase in irrigation although substantial investments in irrigation infrastructure would be required for switzerland it is expected that local and regional water shortages will become more likely under climate changes as low summer discharge will coincide with higher water demands for irrigation brunner et al 2019 thereby the greatest water limitations for irrigation are expected in the south western part of the swiss central plateau where the city of payerne is located natural lakes may serve as alternative sources of irrigation water where river discharge is limited integrated modelling studies considering linkages between plant growth agricultural water demands and water resource availability are suitable to study such questions of water use conflicts in depth however large alternative irrigation water resources such as natural lakes may not be equally accessible in all arable regions with a high and ever increasing production potential one possibility identified in this study could lie in the cultivation of early maturing varieties such varieties would be preferable due to their ability to reach maturity or pass drought sensitive phenological phases before seasonal water deficits occur this effect of drought avoidance is supported by shifts towards earlier sowing dates early sowing provides benefits for irrigation water productivity in general irrespective of varieties both these options could imply additional benefits in terms of heat stress avoidance an effect that is not accounted for in cropsyst which management options future farmers will choose depends not on climate conditions alone market prices costs and agricultural policies will have important influences on future farming systems considering projected climate change impacts on agricultural production potentials at the global scale which suggest a general potential of production increases in the temperate regions it may be anticipated that the relevance of agricultural production may increase rather than decrease in these regions intensification of agricultural management may follow from such socio economic change this could lead to extension of irrigation area and increased abstraction rates not only to satisfy increasing water demands of presently cultivated crops but also for the cultivation of new water intensive crops with high added value e g fruits and vegetables to prevent exploitation of water resources negative impacts on aquatic biodiversity and limit water use conflicts under scenarios of agricultural intensification detailed studies on the future vulnerability of regional water resources to irrigation water abstractions are needed varieties recommended for switzerland correspond largely to early medium varieties considered in this study however during the warm years of 2017 18 a tendency towards later maturing varieties was observed which supports the findings of this study hiltbrunner personal communication strigens personal communication current sowing practices favor rather late sowing between mid april and mid june according to results presented here earlier sowing could be beneficial in terms of water productivity gains and better utilization of growing season already under current conditions however suboptimal soil temperatures during this early period of the year could prevent a good plant establishment during early growth stages and increase weed pressure and the plants susceptibility to pest and diseases hiltbrunner personal communication such effects were not accounted for in this study and should be investigated in more detail in future studies 6 conclusions it was demonstrated that a large scope for adaptations of future grain maize yield productivity in switzerland exists through varietal choices available in europe today impacts of climate change on changes in grain maize yields and irrigation water demands depend strongly on varietal choices and are also influenced by the choice of sowing dates for early maturing grain maize varieties yield declines would have to be expected under climate change assuming that no mitigation measures were taken rcp8 5 under these conditions the cultivation of late maturing varieties in combination with earlier sowing can be considered a suitable adaptation choice to prevent yield declines for grain maize which would even allow for increasing yield levels until mid century however with this adaptation choice irrigation water demands could be expected to increase by up to 40 until the end of the century while absolute estimates of irrigation water demands were strongly dependent on soil depth and to a much smaller degree on soil texture change signals of irrigation water demands were largely unaffected by variation in soil parameters however estimates of future changes in irrigation water demands are subject to large uncertainties originating from climate projection uncertainties implying possible increases in irrigation water demands between 10 and 60 increases in irrigation water demands could be constrained by cultivating early maturing varieties at the expense of lower production potentials selection and breeding efforts steered towards early varieties with extended grain filling duration may help to increase yield potentials declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
