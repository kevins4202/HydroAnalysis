2270,river hydrology on the southeastern tibetan plateau setp is particularly sensitive to climate change through the serious impacts of the decline in indian summer monsoon ism rainfall and the accelerated melting of snow and glaciers during the recent decades investigating the effects of meltwater and rainfall on the seasonality and quantity of river runoff in the region is crucial for improving regional hydrological monitoring and water management and water stable isotopes can provide an effective method based on the event based data of precipitation and river water isotopes river discharge and meteorology monitored at a hydrometric station of the nyang river on the setp in 2011 we show that river discharge has a strong reliance on temperature and precipitation simultaneously through their controls on the meltwater and rainfall runoff and river water deuterium excess d and δ18o potentially track the meltwater and rainfall effects separately the seasonal signals of river discharge and isotopic data provide evidence that meltwater is the key factor of river discharge and isotopic changes during the pre ism season low water level period and ism rainfall during the early to mid ism season growing and high water level period but key factors are not clear during the mid to post ism season recession period these inferred seasonal runoff source relationships are in close agreement with the runoff source contributions estimated using a season specific δ18o d mixing model approach specifically the result suggests meltwater contributes 28 41 and 25 of the total river runoff and snowmelt does make a major contribution to the meltwater compared to glacier melt during the three individual hydrological periods this study investigated the event based river discharge and isotopic responses to temperature and precipitation and the relevance of seasonal meltwater and rainfall effects for a representative basin on the setp and we propose that long term isotopic record of river water in this region may document catchment changes in runoff source relationships especially snowmelt vs ism rainfall keywords discharge regime water stable isotopes meltwater indian summer monsoon ism rainfall southeastern tibetan plateau setp data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and adjacent high mountain ranges are commonly referred to as the asian water tower as rivers fed from these regions supply water to over one billion people biemans et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2010 xu et al 2008 hydrological cycles in these regions have experienced dramatic changes during the recent decades that can be linked to regional atmospheric circulation patterns immerzeel et al 2010 maussion et al 2014 yao et al 2022 zhang et al 2013 the sensitivity of cryospheric snow and glacier melt to a warming climate brun et al 2017 deng et al 2018 yao et al 2012 and the seasonality and intensity of the indian summer monsoon ism ge et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 and these changes profoundly influence downstream water supply and flooding rivers on the tp are prominently fed by multiple water sources including snowmelt glacier melt and rainfall and the complexity of runoff generation processes implies challenges in understanding the hydrological responses to climate change current hydrological projections show increases in river runoff over most of the tp despite the declines in ism rainfall largely owing to the accelerating melting of snow and glaciers under a warming climate jouberton et al 2022 su et al 2016 yao et al 2019 2022 zhang et al 2015 this is particularly relevant for the southeastern tp setp as it contains great permanent snow zones and concentration of glaciers and receives a vast high amount of ism rainfall jouberton et al 2022 yao et al 2012 making it an ideal study area for evaluating the hydrological sensitivity to temperature and precipitation changes li et al 2013 jouberton et al 2022 zhang et al 2015 although previous studies of precipitation runoff modeling have revealed ism rainfall and snowmelt are two major river runoff sources on the setp gao et al 2019 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 their detailed effects on the seasonality and quantity of river runoff are still not well characterized and understood the water isotopic composition

runoff sources snowmelt glacier melt contributions and causes of hydrological extremes recent studies have also shown the integration of water isotopic signals into hydrological models could better simulate the runoff sources and flow paths delavau et al 2017 he et al 2019 nan et al 2021 there are a growing number of isotopic studies on precipitation mechanisms across the tp and himalayas generating a basis for catchment hydrological studies it has been shown that moisture source regime and altitude are two major factors influencing the isotopic signals in precipitation and surface water across the setp southern tp stp and himalayas gao et al 2011 yao et al 2013 the rayleigh distillation of monsoon air masses during orographic lifting cooling and rainout along the moisture

sensitive to relative humidity during evaporation in the moisture source region and precipitation site froehlich et al 2008 gat et al 2003 precipitation derived from the ism moisture is characterized

weak kinetic isotopic fractionation in the oceanic origin hren et al 2009 tian et al 2007 conversely precipitation derived from the continental westerlies recycled moisture is characterized by high d values even 20 ascribed to the strong kinetic isotopic fractionation during moisture source evaporation bershaw et al 2012 gao et al 2011 tian et al 2007 on the setp surface waters in small catchments have been used to reflect local precipitation to establish the regional isotope lapse rate for paleoaltimetry reconstruction bershaw et al 2012 hren et al 2009 li and garzione 2017 a pioneer isotopic study of catchment hydrology on the setp showed river flow was less variable than precipitation in δ18o and the seasonality in precipitation δ18o can be reflected in river flow high values in winter spring but low values in summer yang et al 2009 notwithstanding increasing concerns about the glacier mass loss dynamics and associated hydrological responses to climate change in glaciated catchments of this region jouberton et al 2022 yao et al 2012 2022 systematic investigation of runoff generation processes using the isotope based approach is surprisingly limited here we report the monitoring of event based precipitation river discharge and isotopic signals δ18o and δ2h in both precipitation and river flow in 2011 at a key station of the nyang river an upper branch of the brahmaputra on the setp this work aims to reveal how event based river discharge and isotopic signals δ18o and d respond to temperature and precipitation through their controls on the meltwater and rainfall runoff respectively and further how the runoff source relationship varies seasonally overall we present data from a combined analysis of river hydrology meteorology and water isotopic evidence to elucidate the seasonal discharge regimes involving complex runoff sources for a representative high altitude catchment on the setp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling location description the nyang river on the setp fig 1 a is the second largest tributary of the yarlungzangbo upper brahmaputra it originates in a high mountain area 6000 masl and extends over 300 km from its headwater eastward to the confluence with the yarlungzangbo 2920 masl fig 1c the nyang river basin nrb with a drainage area of 17500 km2 has rough and mountainous topography that the average altitude reaches 4700 masl ranging from 2800 to 7300 masl the region specific geological history along with extensive glaciation and fluvial processes formed deep river valleys along the mainstem and tributaries tao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 annual precipitation over the nrb is highly variable in space and time ranging from 2000 mm at low altitudes in the eastern part to 600 mm at high altitudes in the western part with an average of 1300 mm wang et al 2015 the moisture regime here is driven by the ism in summer but westerlies in winter fig 1a b in summer a large amount of rainfall occurs over the basin as a result of the orographic block effect on the northward transport of monsoon moisture in winter snow accumulates substantially in high mountains but much less in river valleys the percentage of snow cover area reaches a maximum of 47 in winter spring and there are great permanent snow zones in the basin zhang et al 2021 by contrast the percentage of glacier area in the basin is only 3 4 jin et al 2019 shrubs and meadows are two major vegetation types that distribute at altitudes 5200 masl wang et al 2015 this study focuses on the drainage area upstream of the gongbogvanda gbvd hydrometric station 29 88 n 93 25 e 3430 masl in the middle stream of the nyang river fig 1c such station has a drainage area of 6450 km2 with no artificial dam upstream mean annual temperature and precipitation here are 8 3 c and 650 mm respectively with 80 of annual precipitation occurring in the ism months june september fig 1d river discharge shows the same seasonal pattern as precipitation fig 1d with a mean annual discharge of 120 m3 s 2 2 sampling and isotopic analysis we collected event based precipitation and river water samples at the gbvd hydrometric station throughout 2011 when precipitation stopped the water sample was collected immediately and sealed in 15 ml clear dry polyethylene vials with parafilm the precipitation amount p and mean air temperature t air during each precipitation event were recorded after each precipitation event river water was collected 10 20 cm below the water surface near the river bank and then was sealed in 30 ml polyethylene vials the river discharge rate q during sampling was also recorded in total 127 rainfall and 122 river water samples were obtained in this study 5 river water samples were lost during the shipping samples were kept cool 4 c before isotopic analysis δ18o and δ2h measurements were conducted using an l2130 i picarro usa cavity ring down spectrometer crds in the key laboratory of tibetan environment change and land surface processes chinese academy of sciences in beijing isotopic results were reported as parts per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow analytical precision was 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h 2 3 isotope based mixing models fractional contributions of ism and westerlies to river runoff during the whole study period are roughly estimated by constructing a two member mixing model using a d based approach karim and veizer 2002 1 d ism f ism d westerlies f westerlies d riv 2 f ism f westerlies 1 where d riv is the discharge weighted average d value of river water d ism d westerlies and f ism and f westerlies represent the average d values and fractions of the ism and westerlies respectively fractional contributions of river water sources to river runoff are roughly estimated by constructing a three member mixing model using a dual tracer δ18o and d approach 3 d 18 o c 1 f c 1 d 18 o c 2 f c 2 d 18 o c 3 f c 3 d 18 o riv 4 d c 1 f c 1 d c 2 f c 2 d c 3 f c 3 d riv 5 f c 1 f c 2 f c 3 1 where δ18oriv and d riv are the discharge weighted average isotopic data of river water δ18oc1 δ18oc2 δ18oc3 and d c1 d c2 d c3 are the average δ18o and d values of river water sources respectively f c1 f c2 and f c3 are the source fractions respectively 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss 16 pearson s correlation procedure was used to examine the bivariate correlations between variables such as those between water isotopic data δ18o and d and temperature precipitation and river discharge we examined the correlations of river discharge with temperature and precipitation using the partial correlation procedure that accounts for the covariance of temperature with precipitation 3 results 3 1 seasonality in precipitation river discharge and water isotopic signals time series of precipitation amount river discharge air temperature δ18o to avoid duplication δ2h is not shown and d of precipitation and river water at gbvd over the study period are presented in fig 2 the total precipitation amount is 518 5 mm and all precipitation falls in the phase of rainfall about 84 of the annual precipitation amount and 81 of the precipitation events are concentrated in the monsoon months june september river discharge ranges from 18 6 to 743 0 m3 s with an average of 290 6 m3 s and on a monthly basis exhibits the minimum and maximum in april and july respectively precipitation δ18o δ18oppt ranges from 26 8 to 3 8 while precipitation d d ppt ranges from 13 8 to 25 4 with amount weighted averages of 14 3 6 1 mean sd and 5 0 7 0 respectively δ18oppt and d ppt exhibit similar seasonal variations high values in april may pre ism months and october post ism month but low values in the intermediate period by contrast river water exhibits quite small fluctuations and variations in isotopic signals from 18 1 to 13 0 for δ18o δ18oriv and from 5 0 to 11 4 for d d riv with discharge weighted averages of 16 4 1 4 and 9 2 1 1 respectively δ18oriv and d riv show nearly parallel temporal variability increase progressively from early april to mid june then turn to decrease until early august and vary slightly afterward on average river water is isotopically more depleted than precipitation at the study site because the isotopic signals of precipitation deriving from the upstream catchment region preserve in the river water the attenuated fluctuations and small seasonal amplitudes of δ18oriv and d riv are consistent with the fact that river water integrates various water sources over a long period within a basin clark and fritz 1997 reckerth et al 2017 3 2 meteorological effects on precipitation δ18o there is a significant negative relationship between δ18oppt and precipitation fig s1 with lapse rates of 0 37 mm and 0 13 mm on event and weekly basis respectively this implies lower δ18oppt values are related to higher precipitation in line with other studies on the stp and setp gao et al 2011 he et al 2015 tian et al 2020 this amount effect is tightly linked to the monsoon activity and atmospheric convection that would induce heavy rainfall high vapour height level and hence strong isotopic fractionation gao et al 2011 yu et al 2016 in contrast δ18oppt does not relate to t air on any temporal basis 3 3 δ18o δ2h relationships for precipitation and river water regression of δ18oppt and δ2hppt values yields a local meteoric water line lmwl of δ2h 8 29 δ18o 7 01 fig 3 with a close slope compared to the gmwl indicating a minimal effect of below cloud evaporation at the study site this lmwl is similar to those for ism dominated sites across the tp such as lhasa on the stp δ2h 7 9 δ18o 6 29 tian et al 2001 and bomi on the setp δ2h 7 85 δ18o 4 27 gao et al 2011 regression of δ18oriv and δ2hriv values yields a river water line rwl of δ2h 8 28 δ18o 13 60 fig 3 with an almost identical slope but a higher intercept compared to the lmwl given that post precipitation evaporation would lower the δ18o δ2h slope and intercept for surface waters gibson and reid 2010 kendall and coplen 2001 the result here suggests no evidence of evaporative effect during the runoff generation and water movement potential factors influencing river isotopic signals should be catchment hydrological processes rather than evaporation 3 4 seasonal phases of precipitation and river discharge the strong seasonality in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the stp setp and himalayas driven by different seasonal moisture sources atmospheric circulations presents an opportunity for identifying the monsoon onset and retreat yang et al 2018 yu et al 2016 we use an approach similar to that of yang et al 2018 to detect the monsoon onset at gbvd and two criteria are proposed 1 the weighted average δ18oppt in the typical pre monsoon month of april 7 0 is taken as a threshold and 2 the monsoon onset date is identified when δ18oppt is lower than the threshold for 4 days within a 7 day period from early june onward by days the monsoon retreat can be roughly defined by the last increase in δ18oppt in september tian et al 2020 the result suggests the monsoon onset and retreat at gbvd in 2011 occurs on june 15 δ18oppt 9 0 and september 27 δ18oppt 17 7 respectively the catchment hydrological changes can be detected by the break or inflection of the catchment cumulative p vs q curve the double mass curve pirnia et al 2019 wang et al 2019 weiss and wilson 1953 despite the site specific sampling in this study cumulative q varies systematically with cumulative p and a cubic fitting yields a highly significant correlation r 2 0 996 fig 4 a the study period can be divided into three phases q1 of april 1 june 14 q2 of june 15 august 3 and q3 of the remaining period fig 4b relationships for individual periods can be constrained well by quadratic fittings with r 2 of 0 984 0 993 and 0 966 respectively combining the temporal variability in river discharge such three phases approximately match with the three hydrological periods the low water level the growing and high water level and the recession periods which correspond to the pre ism early to mid ism and mid to post ism seasons respectively 4 discussion 4 1 isotopic signals of major runoff sources the nyang river has the lowest discharge in early april when the δ18oriv and d riv 16 and 6 reflect the fluvial baseflow the baseflow thus has relatively lower δ18o but close d compared to local precipitation 14 3 for δ18oppt and 5 0 for d ppt current studies across the tp and himalayas have shown the ism rainfall is quite variable in δ18o relying on sampling altitude but consistent in d for instance ism rainfall has an average δ18o and d of 18 2 and 4 1 at lhasa on the stp 3700 masl 200 km west of gbvd tian et al 2007 12 9 and 5 3 at bomi on the setp 2720 masl 240 km east of gbvd gao et al 2011 15 7 and 5 0 at nyalam 3810 masl in the southern himalayas tian et al 2007 and 19 5 and 4 1 at tingri 4330 masl in the northern himalayas kang et al 2002 the weighted average d ppt in the monsoon months at gbvd in this study 4 2 matches with the d values of ism rainfall mentioned above 4 6 these suggest from the d point of view the baseflow of nyang river largely mirrors the ism rainfall over the drainage snow in high mountain areas of the setp mainly occurs in winter except in accumulation zones of glaciers although high altitude snow was not sampled in this study data for nearby regions can be applied owing to the same winter moisture sources i e westerlies fig 1b in winter the average δ18oppt are 9 8 and 7 5 and d ppt are 22 1 and 19 1 respectively at lhasa and nyalam tian et al 2007 the winter snow on a glacier of mt yulong on the setp has an average δ18o and d of 6 3 and 16 0 respectively pu et al 2020 yang et al 2009 also observed significantly higher δ18oppt 10 3 in winter than in summer 16 6 at lulang on the setp 3400 masl 140 km east of gbvd high δ18o and d of winter snow appear to be typical features of westerlies derived precipitation tian et al 2005 2007 yu et al 2016 and the high d is probably also related to the super cool temperature and kinetic fractionation in the cloud at snow formation jouzel and merlivat 1984 rozanski et al 1993 the averages of these δ18o and d values 8 6 and 19 4 compare well with those of winter precipitation in the eastern mediterranean region 6 and 20 gnip iaea 2022 table s1 confirming the dominant moisture source of westerlies snowmelt should carry the snow isotopic signals to a great extent despite the ice liquid isotopic exchange during the snow melting zhou et al 2008 using d of 4 6 for the ism 19 4 for the westerlies and the discharge weighted average of 9 2 for the nyang river at gbvd the two member isotopic balance eqs 1 2 requires 24 34 of river water is derived from the westerlies or winter snow it is thus reasonable to expect that the snowmelt is characterized by remarkably higher δ18o and d relative to the ism rainfall and baseflow over the nrb since the isotopic seasonality in precipitation displays coherence in a large space within a climate domain glacier melt on the setp is derived from the glacier ice melt ism rainfall and snowmelt in ablation zones of glaciers zhu et al 2017 the result from the zuoqiupu ice core drilled from the setp shows conspicuous seasonal fluctuations in δ18o concentrating from 18 9 summer precipitation to 10 1 winter precipitation with an average of 14 4 zhao et al 2017 and this average value may approximately reflect the average glacier ice melt in the region direct glacier melt on the setp was also collected in a previous study showing average δ18o and d of 16 3 and 15 5 respectively n 6 ren et al 2017 lower δ18o and d of glacier melt than snowmelt appear to occur widely in regions of the setp and himalayas for example in eastern nepal central himalayas the average δ18o and d of glacier melt are 15 7 and 13 1 while those of snowmelt are 7 9 and 17 6 respectively voss et al 2020 in a sub basin of the upper ganges western himalayas average δ18o and d of glacier melt are 12 6 and 18 8 respectively while those of precipitation in the winter half year are 7 4 and 23 3 respectively kumar et al 2018 therefore glacier melt shows intermediate δ18o and d values between snowmelt and ism rainfall within a broad high altitude region where the ism and westerlies dominate seasonally taken together meltwater especially snowmelt and ism rainfall on the setp differ greatly in isotopic signals δ18o and d which can be used to separate their effects on river runoff 4 2 river discharge and isotopic responses to temperature and precipitation over the study period to assess how river discharge and isotopic signals respond to temperature and precipitation over the study period we evaluated relationships among variables using simple correlation analysis and the results are presented in table 1 it shows that river discharge increases significantly with temperature with lapse rates of 25 9 m3 c r 2 0 18 p 0 001 27 1 m3 c r 2 0 32 p 0 002 and 44 3 m3 c r 2 0 62 p 0 036 on event weekly and monthly basis respectively the increasing discharge with temperature is typically observed in high latitude snowmelt driven catchments where higher temperatures would cause accelerated snow melting and hence greater river discharge serreze et al 2000 yang et al 2002 however such a hydrological regime cannot be the case for the nrb as ism rainfall accounts for the majority of annual precipitation here the general overlap of the summer melting and rainy seasons implies the increasing discharge with t air cannot be simply interpreted as a result of the meltwater effect on the other hand we also found river discharge increases significantly with precipitation on weekly and monthly basis with lapse rates of 6 2 m3 mm r 2 0 41 p 0 001 and 2 6 m3 mm r 2 0 73 p 0 015 respectively regarding the positive p t air relationship r 0 42 p 0 030 on a weekly basis r 0 79 p 0 035 on a monthly basis it is necessary to conduct partial correlation analysis to evaluate the bivariate q t air q p relationship to remove the additional influence of p t air still strong q t air and q p relationships on a weekly basis are achieved r 0 42 p 0 032 r 0 56 p 0 003 respectively and the higher q p correlation here suggests rainfall relatively more influences the river runoff than meltwater the selected multiple stepwise linear regression model for the weekly data confirms temperature and precipitation are both important predictors of river discharge together explaining 54 of its variation these results provide direct evidence that the discharge of the nyang river has a strong reliance on temperature and precipitation simultaneously which separately reflect the meltwater and rainfall effects over the drainage for river isotopic data one of the prominent findings is that d riv increases strongly with t air on event and weekly basis table 1 with lapse rates of 1 18 c r 2 0 24 p 0 001 and 1 86 c r 2 0 40 p 0 001 respectively in phase with the positive q t air relationship and remarkably high d of meltwater relative to ism rainfall and baseflow over the basin the increasing d riv with t air likely corresponds to the increasing meltwater proportion in river runoff moreover it is notable that d ppt decreases significantly with t air on all event weekly and monthly basis r 0 63 p 0 001 r 0 73 p 0 001 r 0 87 p 0 011 figures not shown and this provides additional evidence that the positive q t air relationship does reflect the meltwater effect as greater rainfall input at higher temperatures from the positive p t air relationship would tend to decrease d riv contradicting the observation encountered here on the other hand the linkage between river runoff and precipitation is clearly indicated by the positive δ18oriv δ18oppt relationship on each temporal basis table 1 and the increasing δ18oriv with δ18oppt can be explained by the increasing rainfall proportion in river runoff accordingly additionally the isotopic amount effect in precipitation over the study area fig s1 may partly contribute to this relationship because greater rainfall runoff due to higher precipitation with lower δ18oppt would tend to decrease δ18oriv these results suggest that river water d and δ18o potentially separately track the meltwater and rainfall effects on river runoff over the drainage river discharge and isotopic signals are representative of earlier precipitation and meltwater information to address this effect the aforementioned relationships using data prior to the in situ measurements were evaluated the time lag was set from 0 to 5 weeks and the results are compiled in table s2 it shows that the correlation is significant at various lags for q t air while at lags of 0 3 weeks for q p the correlation for both initially increases and then decreases with the maximum largest response at the lag of 1 week r 0 62 p 0 001 and 2 weeks r 0 69 p 0 001 respectively for river isotopic data correlation is significant at lags of 0 2 weeks for d riv t air but 0 5 weeks for δ18oppt δ18oriv the correlation for d riv t air displays the same variation trend as that for q t air also with the maximum at the lag of 1 week r 0 77 p 0 001 in contrast the correlation for δ18oppt δ18oriv displays a similar variation trend to that for p q but the highest occurs 1 week later at 3 weeks lag thus either from the river discharge or isotopic point of view the largest response of river runoff to temperature further meltwater takes place 1 2 weeks earlier than to rainfall consistent with the great complexity in the rainfall runoff relative to the meltwater runoff processes freeze 1974 sivakumar et al 2001 4 3 seasonal dynamics in dominant runoff sources the covariation of cumulative q and p at the study site reveals three consecutive hydrological phases for the nyang river fig 4b which do not completely match with the precipitation phases since the time point of the second seasonal transfer occurs in the middle ism season the hydrological phase division is strongly supported by the unique isotope discharge pattern fig 5 δ18oriv and d riv increase with discharge in q1 δ18oriv and d riv decrease with discharge in q2 and δ18oriv and d riv show muted variation trends with discharge in q3 this isotope discharge pattern is undoubtedly associated with unique season specific discharge regimes involving different water sources and or their relative contributions to river runoff in the pre ism season also q1 the river is fed mainly by baseflow and meltwater and we speculated that meltwater is the key driver of river discharge and isotopic changes given that baseflow is usually steady and has small variations in isotopic composition over time this is confirmed by the simultaneous increases in q δ18oriv and d riv with t air fig 6 a c because meltwater either snowmelt and glacier melt is featured by much higher δ18o an d values than baseflow the increases in δ18oriv and d riv with discharge here can be ascribed to the increases in meltwater proportion in river runoff from early april to mid june as temperature rises from 5 to 15 c and the highest δ18oriv d riv in mid june should correspond to the greatest meltwater proportion accordingly by contrast the occasionally occurring rains in this period may preferentially replenish the soil water storage liu et al 2017 yang et al 2003 and has minimal influences on river discharge fig 2 after the monsoon onset from mid june on both rainfall and river discharge increase significantly while δ18oriv and d riv turn to progressively decline within q2 fig 2 the river isotopic changes clearly reflect the substantial water input from ism rainfall that is featured by low δ18o and d values though higher temperature and rainfall would accelerate snow and glacier melting boral et al 2019 doyle et al 2015 it is difficult to evaluate the temporal variability in the meltwater and ism rainfall contributions in q2 at this present stage but the coupled increasing decreasing ism rainfall meltwater proportion in river runoff and increasing river discharge is likely the mechanisms responsible for the decreasing trend of δ18oriv d riv with discharge fig 5 the insignificant relationships between t air and q δ18oriv and d riv fig 6d f but strong and positive relationship between δ18oriv and δ18oppt fig 7 b provide additional evidence that ism rainfall more influences river runoff than meltwater the lowest highest δ18oriv and d riv with the maximum minimum discharge at the end start of q2 thus represent the largest smallest ism rainfall contribution to river runoff early august is another important transition time as river discharge turns to decrease while δ18oriv and d riv vary slightly with time fig 2 in addition to the overall declining rainfall the declining meltwater is another potential cause of the decreasing river discharge in q3 from late spring on snow melts at a high rate so that the percentage of snow cover area in the basin decreases to a low value in july on average from 47 in january april to 12 in july zhang et al 2021 leading to decreasing meltwater runoff afterward the present result suggests that there is no significant relationship between t air and q δ18oriv and d riv fig 6g i and between δ18oriv and δ18oppt fig 7c highlighting neither rainfall nor meltwater can be the key factor of river runoff changes nevertheless we noted intense rains still induce apparent increases in river discharge in this period fig 2 which can be somewhat reflected by the isotopic data concerning the marginally significant δ18oriv δ18oppt relationship fig 7c we therefore argue that rainfall still more influences the river runoff than meltwater in this period 4 4 quantification of seasonal runoff source contributors to rigorously test the seasonal runoff source relationships inferred above we estimated the season specific fractional contributions of runoff sources by constructing a three member mixing model using a dual tracer δ18o and d approach eqs 3 5 δ2h was not chosen because δ18o and δ2h of river water and precipitation are highly correlated fig 3 and δ18o and d show a low degree of covariance since a dual isotope approach was employed only three sources can be considered phillips and gregg 2003 in q1 three sources namely baseflow snowmelt and glacier melt were considered in q2 and q3 combining snowmelt and glacier melt into a single component three sources of rainfall meltwater and baseflow were considered these simplifications make the number of potential sources reduce to three in each period the δ18oriv and d riv values were measured directly baseflow was assumed to equal river water in early april and be constant in isotopic composition as d ppt is primarily related to moisture source and has a rather minor dependence on sampling location the weighted average d ppt at gbvd was used to represent the catchment d ppt by contrast δ18oppt is strongly altitude dependent and the catchment δ18oppt was obtained from the δ18oppt lapse rate of 0 33 100 m yao et al 2009 weighted average δ18oppt at gbvd and mean catchment altitude of 5300 masl estimated from the dem data literature and our data were compiled together to yield average δ18o and d values of snowmelt and glacier melt which were assumed to be invariant over time the data for calculations and results are presented in table 2 the baseflow has a fraction of 72 11 while the meltwater has a fraction of 28 26 9 for snowmelt and 2 11 for glacier melt in q1 this result coincides with the sharp increase in δ18oriv and d riv with discharge fig 5 as a small input of meltwater may lead to an apparent increase in δ18oriv and d riv as for the considerable isotopic difference between meltwater especially snowmelt and baseflow the much higher fraction of snowmelt than glacier melt agrees with the common knowledge about the much larger area of snow cover than glaciers in spring early summer over the basin zhang et al 2021 even in glaciated catchments glacier ice is less exposed than snow in spring early summer and snowmelt forms a major contributor of meltwater as observed in the western himalayas jeelani et al 2017 rai et al 2019 and alps penna et al 2017 the rather high fraction of baseflow is possibly related to the high catchment vegetation cover that could sustain a large groundwater reservoir especially for altitudes 5200 masl where shrubland or meadowland dominates jin et al 2019 the estimated fractions here also partly explain the quadratic δ18oriv d riv discharge pattern in q1 fig 5 if the river was fed by baseflow and snowmelt only snowmelt would drive the river discharge and isotopic changes leading to overall linear isotope discharge patterns as observed in the pan arctic region st amour et al 2005 yi et al 2010 yi et al 2012 and several german drainages reckerth et al 2017 for the nrb since glacier melt has intermediate δ18o and d values between snowmelt and baseflow and the overturns occur in late spring early summer when glaciers begin to melt intensively the glacier melt input would likely lower the δ18o and d of the snowmelt baseflow mixture thereby causing quadratic isotope discharge patterns as expected ism rainfall and meltwater become major contributors in q2 with fractions of 48 21 and 41 9 respectively and the baseflow fraction decreases sharply to 11 23 based on the calculated results average runoff source discharges can be obtained where baseflow discharge varies from 53 to 48 m3 s and meltwater discharge from 21 to 177 m3 s from q1 to q2 in line with our expected steady baseflow but significant increases of meltwater as temperature rises assuming the river was fed by rainfall snowmelt and glacier melt regarding the very low baseflow fraction the same approach was used to partition the snowmelt and glacier melt contributions and the result also highlights a much higher fraction of snowmelt 35 than glacier melt 7 notably the total meltwater fractions are almost the same whether baseflow is considered or not 41 vs 42 verifying the correctness of the isotope mixing model and endmember isotopic data employed here these provide robust and quantitative evidence that the proportional mixing between ism rainfall and meltwater is the major catchment hydrological process in q2 but the ism rainfall should be the determinant of δ18oriv fig 7b as well as the negative δ18oriv d riv discharge pattern fig 5 owing to its large amount and much lower δ18o and d relative to meltwater rainfall and meltwater fractions decline to 32 15 and 25 15 respectively whereas baseflow fraction increases to 43 19 in q3 the proportional mixing among such three sources becomes the major catchment hydrological process and their relative contributions to river runoff likely do not change greatly concerning the small river isotopic magnitudes and muted isotope discharge patterns fig 5 it is difficult to explore why the baseflow fraction increases remarkably from q2 to q3 11 vs 43 in lack of long term groundwater data besides the reductions in rainfall and meltwater inputs the possibility still exists that groundwater is more recharged by recent rains thereby leading to an underestimated rainfall fraction but overestimated baseflow fraction and this hypothesis seems to be supported by the large increase in average baseflow discharge from q2 to q3 48 vs 92 m3 s a further well thought experimental design for monitoring the isotopic data of catchment groundwater is needed to interrogate such a hypothesis also to compare snowmelt and glacier melt contributions we combined rainfall and baseflow into a single component by simply taking their average values and the result of the three member mixing model suggests glacier melt is not the contributor with a minus fraction and snowmelt has a fraction of 25 therefore our dataset indicates that the snowmelt makes a major contribution to meltwater throughout the whole study period the isotope based contribution estimations here carry large uncertainties because there are many assumptions and the isotopic values of water sources are not well constrained due to the limited data for example the isotopic values of meltwater would vary with snowmelt vs glacier melt input in q2 and q3 but invariant isotopic values were assigned the isotopic values of glacier melt and snowmelt may vary with the sampling location and timing but averages of limited data were used which may make the results somewhat biased nevertheless the estimated results are in close agreement with our river discharge and isotopic observations in each hydrological period we emphasize that this is ongoing research and with growing isotopic data of runoff sources over the region the application of the isotopic mass balance model would help better determine their relative contributions to total river runoff 5 conclusion the nyang river illustrates the complexity of interpreting seasonal changes in river discharge and isotopic signals particularly in the high altitude region of the setp where both snowmelt and ism rainfall play significant roles the close relationships of river discharge with both temperature and precipitation corroborate the hypothesis that the river is featured by a combined meltwater rainfall discharge regime further statistical correlation analysis reveals a great potential to employ river water d excess and δ18o data to track the separate effects of meltwater and rainfall on river runoff based on the seasonal patterns of river discharge and isotopic signals we found meltwater is the key factor of river runoff changes in the pre ism season low water level period ism rainfall in the early to mid ism season growing and high water level period but key factors are not clear in the mid to post ism season recession period while applying a season specific dual tracer δ18o and d mixing model approach the estimated results show agreement with the inferred runoff source relationships in each hydrological period specifically meltwater is found to generate 28 41 and 25 of the total river runoff and snowmelt makes much higher contributions to the meltwater than glacier melt throughout the whole study period these observations improve our understanding of seasonal dynamics of river discharge and isotopic signals on the setp we propose that long term river water isotopic records δ18o and d over the region will likely document catchment hydrological changes in runoff source relationships that are closely linked to temperature and precipitation through their controls on the meltewater and rainfall runoff if for example the timing or extent of catchment meltwater and ism rainfall changes this will be directly reflected in river water δ18o and d

2270,river hydrology on the southeastern tibetan plateau setp is particularly sensitive to climate change through the serious impacts of the decline in indian summer monsoon ism rainfall and the accelerated melting of snow and glaciers during the recent decades investigating the effects of meltwater and rainfall on the seasonality and quantity of river runoff in the region is crucial for improving regional hydrological monitoring and water management and water stable isotopes can provide an effective method based on the event based data of precipitation and river water isotopes river discharge and meteorology monitored at a hydrometric station of the nyang river on the setp in 2011 we show that river discharge has a strong reliance on temperature and precipitation simultaneously through their controls on the meltwater and rainfall runoff and river water deuterium excess d and δ18o potentially track the meltwater and rainfall effects separately the seasonal signals of river discharge and isotopic data provide evidence that meltwater is the key factor of river discharge and isotopic changes during the pre ism season low water level period and ism rainfall during the early to mid ism season growing and high water level period but key factors are not clear during the mid to post ism season recession period these inferred seasonal runoff source relationships are in close agreement with the runoff source contributions estimated using a season specific δ18o d mixing model approach specifically the result suggests meltwater contributes 28 41 and 25 of the total river runoff and snowmelt does make a major contribution to the meltwater compared to glacier melt during the three individual hydrological periods this study investigated the event based river discharge and isotopic responses to temperature and precipitation and the relevance of seasonal meltwater and rainfall effects for a representative basin on the setp and we propose that long term isotopic record of river water in this region may document catchment changes in runoff source relationships especially snowmelt vs ism rainfall keywords discharge regime water stable isotopes meltwater indian

ge et al 2017 wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 and these changes profoundly influence downstream water supply and flooding rivers on the tp are prominently fed by multiple water sources including snowmelt glacier melt and rainfall and the complexity of runoff generation processes implies challenges in understanding the hydrological responses to climate change current hydrological projections show increases in river runoff over most of the tp despite the declines in ism rainfall largely owing to the accelerating melting of snow and glaciers under a warming climate jouberton et al 2022 su et al 2016 yao et al 2019 2022 zhang et al 2015 this is particularly relevant for the southeastern tp setp as it contains great permanent snow zones and concentration of glaciers and receives a vast high amount of ism rainfall jouberton et al 2022 yao et al 2012 making it an ideal study area for evaluating the hydrological sensitivity to temperature and precipitation changes li et al 2013 jouberton et al 2022 zhang et al 2015 although previous studies of precipitation runoff modeling have revealed ism rainfall and snowmelt are two major river runoff sources on the setp gao et al 2019 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 their detailed effects on the seasonality and quantity of river runoff are still not well characterized and understood the water isotopic composition

runoff sources snowmelt glacier melt contributions and causes of hydrological extremes recent studies have also shown the integration of water isotopic signals into hydrological models could better simulate the runoff sources and flow paths delavau et al 2017 he et al 2019 nan et al 2021 there are a growing number of isotopic studies on precipitation mechanisms across the tp and himalayas generating a basis for catchment hydrological studies it has been shown that moisture source regime and altitude are two major factors influencing the isotopic signals in precipitation and surface

study of catchment hydrology on the setp showed river flow was less variable than precipitation in δ18o and the seasonality in precipitation δ18o can be reflected in river flow high values in winter spring but low values in summer yang et al 2009 notwithstanding increasing concerns about the glacier mass loss dynamics and associated hydrological responses to climate change in glaciated catchments of this region jouberton et al 2022 yao et al 2012 2022 systematic investigation of runoff generation processes using the isotope based approach is surprisingly limited here we report the monitoring of event based precipitation river discharge and isotopic signals δ18o and δ2h in both precipitation and river flow in 2011 at a key station of the nyang river an upper branch of the brahmaputra on the setp this work aims to reveal how event based river discharge and isotopic signals δ18o and d respond to temperature and precipitation through their controls on the meltwater and rainfall runoff respectively and further how the runoff source relationship varies seasonally overall we present data from a combined analysis of river hydrology meteorology and water isotopic evidence to elucidate the seasonal discharge regimes involving complex runoff sources for a representative high altitude catchment on the setp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling location description the nyang river on the setp fig 1 a is the second largest tributary of the yarlungzangbo upper brahmaputra it originates in a high mountain area 6000 masl and extends over 300 km from its headwater eastward to the confluence with the yarlungzangbo 2920 masl fig 1c the nyang river basin nrb with a drainage area of 17500 km2 has rough and mountainous topography that the average altitude reaches 4700 masl ranging from 2800 to 7300 masl the region specific geological history along with extensive glaciation and fluvial processes formed deep river valleys along the mainstem and tributaries tao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 annual precipitation over the nrb is highly variable in space and time ranging from 2000 mm at low altitudes in the eastern part to 600 mm at high altitudes in the western part with an average of 1300 mm wang et al 2015 the moisture regime here is driven by the ism in summer but westerlies in winter fig 1a b in summer a large amount of rainfall occurs over the basin as a result of the orographic block effect on the northward transport of monsoon moisture in winter snow accumulates substantially in high mountains but much less in river valleys the percentage of snow cover area reaches a maximum of 47 in winter spring and there are great permanent snow zones in the basin zhang et al 2021 by contrast the percentage of glacier area in the basin is only 3 4 jin et al 2019 shrubs and meadows are two major vegetation types that distribute at altitudes 5200 masl wang et al 2015 this study focuses on the drainage area upstream of the gongbogvanda gbvd hydrometric station 29 88 n 93 25 e 3430 masl in the middle stream of the nyang river fig 1c such station has a drainage area of 6450 km2 with no artificial dam upstream mean annual temperature and precipitation here are 8 3 c and 650 mm respectively with 80 of annual precipitation occurring in the ism months june september fig 1d river discharge shows the same seasonal pattern as precipitation fig 1d with a mean annual discharge of 120 m3 s 2 2 sampling and isotopic analysis we collected event based precipitation and river water samples at the gbvd hydrometric station throughout 2011 when precipitation stopped the water sample was collected immediately and sealed in 15 ml clear dry polyethylene vials with parafilm the precipitation amount p and mean air temperature t air during each precipitation event were recorded after each precipitation event river water was collected 10 20 cm below the water surface near the river bank and then was sealed in 30 ml polyethylene vials the river discharge rate q during sampling was also recorded in total 127 rainfall and 122 river water samples were obtained in this study 5 river water samples were lost during the shipping samples were kept cool 4 c before isotopic analysis δ18o and δ2h measurements were conducted using an l2130 i picarro usa cavity ring down spectrometer crds in the key laboratory of tibetan environment change and land surface processes chinese academy of sciences in beijing isotopic results were reported as parts per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow analytical precision was 0 1 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h 2 3 isotope based mixing models fractional contributions of ism and westerlies to river runoff during the whole study period are roughly estimated by constructing a two member mixing model using a d based approach karim and veizer 2002 1 d ism f ism d westerlies f westerlies d riv 2 f ism f westerlies 1 where d riv is the discharge weighted average d value of river water d ism d westerlies and f ism and f westerlies represent the average d values and fractions of the ism and westerlies respectively fractional contributions of river water sources to river runoff are roughly estimated by constructing a three member mixing model using a dual tracer δ18o and d approach 3 d 18 o c 1 f c 1 d 18 o c 2 f c 2 d 18 o c 3 f c 3 d 18 o riv 4 d c 1 f c 1 d c 2 f c 2 d c 3 f c 3 d riv 5 f c 1 f c 2 f c 3 1 where δ18oriv and d riv are the discharge weighted average isotopic data of river water δ18oc1 δ18oc2 δ18oc3 and d c1 d c2 d c3 are the average δ18o and d values of river water sources respectively f c1 f c2 and f c3 are the source fractions respectively 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss 16 pearson s correlation procedure was used to examine the bivariate correlations between variables such as those between water isotopic data δ18o and d and temperature precipitation and river discharge we examined the correlations of river discharge with temperature and precipitation using the partial correlation procedure that accounts for the covariance of temperature with precipitation 3 results 3 1 seasonality in precipitation river discharge and water isotopic signals time series of precipitation amount river discharge air temperature δ18o to avoid duplication δ2h is not shown and d of precipitation and river water at gbvd over the study period are presented in fig 2 the total precipitation amount is 518 5 mm and all precipitation falls in the phase of rainfall about 84 of the annual precipitation amount and 81 of the precipitation events are concentrated in the monsoon months june september river discharge ranges from 18 6 to 743 0 m3 s with an average of 290 6 m3 s and on a monthly basis exhibits the minimum and maximum in april and july respectively precipitation δ18o δ18oppt ranges from 26 8 to 3 8 while precipitation d d ppt ranges from 13 8 to 25 4 with amount weighted averages of 14 3 6 1 mean sd and 5 0 7 0 respectively δ18oppt and d ppt exhibit similar seasonal variations high values in april may pre ism months and october post ism month but low values in the intermediate period by contrast river water exhibits quite small fluctuations and variations in isotopic signals from 18 1 to 13 0 for δ18o δ18oriv and from 5 0 to 11 4 for d d riv with discharge weighted averages of 16 4 1 4 and 9 2 1 1 respectively δ18oriv and d riv show nearly parallel temporal variability increase progressively from early april to mid june then turn to decrease until early august and vary slightly afterward on average river water is isotopically more depleted than precipitation at the study site because the isotopic signals of precipitation deriving from the upstream catchment region preserve in the river water the attenuated fluctuations and small seasonal amplitudes of δ18oriv and d riv are consistent with the fact that river water integrates various water sources over a long period within a basin clark and fritz 1997 reckerth et al 2017 3 2 meteorological effects on precipitation δ18o there is a significant negative relationship between δ18oppt and precipitation fig s1 with lapse rates of 0 37 mm and 0 13 mm on event and weekly basis respectively this implies lower δ18oppt values are related to higher precipitation in line with other studies on the stp and setp gao et al 2011 he et al 2015 tian et al 2020 this amount effect is tightly linked to the monsoon activity and atmospheric convection that would induce heavy rainfall high vapour height level and hence strong isotopic fractionation gao et al 2011 yu et al 2016 in contrast δ18oppt does not relate to t air on any temporal basis 3 3 δ18o δ2h relationships for precipitation and river water regression of δ18oppt and δ2hppt values yields a local meteoric water line lmwl of δ2h 8 29 δ18o 7 01 fig 3 with a close slope compared to the gmwl indicating a minimal effect of below cloud evaporation at the study site this lmwl is similar to those for ism dominated sites across the tp such as lhasa on the stp δ2h 7 9 δ18o 6 29 tian et al 2001 and bomi on the setp δ2h 7 85 δ18o 4 27 gao et al 2011 regression of δ18oriv and δ2hriv values yields a river water line rwl of δ2h 8 28 δ18o 13 60 fig 3 with an almost identical slope but a higher intercept compared to the lmwl given that post precipitation evaporation would lower the δ18o δ2h slope and intercept for surface waters gibson and reid 2010 kendall and coplen 2001 the result here suggests no evidence of evaporative effect during the runoff generation and water movement potential factors influencing river isotopic signals should be catchment hydrological processes rather than evaporation 3 4 seasonal phases of precipitation and river discharge the strong seasonality in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the stp setp and himalayas driven by different seasonal moisture sources atmospheric circulations presents an opportunity for identifying the monsoon onset and retreat yang et al 2018 yu et al 2016 we use an approach similar to that of yang et al 2018 to detect the monsoon onset at gbvd and two criteria are proposed 1 the weighted average δ18oppt in the typical pre monsoon month of april 7 0 is taken as a threshold and 2 the monsoon onset date is identified when δ18oppt is lower than the threshold for 4 days within a 7 day period from early june onward by days the monsoon retreat can be roughly defined by the last increase in δ18oppt in september tian et al 2020 the result suggests the monsoon onset and retreat at gbvd in 2011 occurs on june 15 δ18oppt 9 0 and september 27 δ18oppt 17 7 respectively the catchment hydrological changes can be detected by the break or inflection of the catchment cumulative p vs q curve the double mass curve pirnia et al 2019 wang et al 2019 weiss and wilson 1953 despite the site specific sampling in this study cumulative q varies systematically with cumulative p and a cubic fitting yields a highly significant correlation r 2 0 996 fig 4 a the study period can be divided into three phases q1 of april 1 june 14 q2 of june 15 august 3 and q3 of the remaining period fig 4b relationships for individual periods can be constrained well by quadratic fittings with r 2 of 0 984 0 993 and 0 966 respectively combining the temporal variability in river discharge such three phases approximately match with the three hydrological periods the low water level the growing and high water level and the recession periods which correspond to the pre ism early to mid ism and mid to post ism seasons respectively 4 discussion 4 1 isotopic signals of major runoff sources the nyang river has the lowest discharge in early april when the δ18oriv and d riv 16 and 6 reflect the fluvial baseflow the baseflow thus has relatively lower δ18o but close d compared to local precipitation 14 3 for δ18oppt and 5 0 for d ppt current studies across the tp and himalayas have shown the ism rainfall is quite variable in δ18o relying on sampling altitude but consistent in d for instance ism rainfall has an average δ18o and d of 18 2 and 4 1 at lhasa on the stp 3700 masl 200 km west of gbvd tian et al 2007 12 9 and 5 3 at bomi on the setp 2720 masl 240 km east of gbvd gao et al 2011 15 7 and 5 0 at nyalam 3810 masl in the southern himalayas tian et al 2007 and 19 5 and 4 1 at tingri 4330 masl in the northern himalayas kang et al 2002 the weighted average d ppt in the monsoon months at gbvd in this study 4 2 matches with the d values of ism rainfall mentioned above 4 6 these suggest from the d point of view the baseflow of nyang river largely mirrors the ism rainfall over the drainage snow in high mountain areas of the setp mainly occurs in winter except in accumulation zones of glaciers although high altitude snow was not sampled in this study data for nearby regions can be applied owing to the same winter moisture sources i e westerlies fig 1b in winter the average δ18oppt are 9 8 and 7 5 and d ppt are 22 1 and 19 1 respectively at lhasa and nyalam tian et al 2007 the winter snow on a glacier of mt yulong on the setp has an average δ18o and d of 6 3 and 16 0 respectively pu et al 2020 yang et al 2009 also observed significantly higher δ18oppt 10 3 in winter than in summer 16 6 at lulang on the setp 3400 masl 140 km east of gbvd high δ18o and d of winter snow appear to be typical features of westerlies derived precipitation tian et al 2005 2007 yu et al 2016 and the high d is probably also related to the super cool temperature and kinetic fractionation in the cloud at snow formation jouzel and merlivat 1984 rozanski et al 1993 the averages of these δ18o and d values 8 6 and 19 4 compare well with those of winter precipitation in the eastern mediterranean region 6 and 20 gnip iaea 2022 table s1 confirming the dominant moisture source of westerlies snowmelt should carry the snow isotopic signals to a great extent despite the ice liquid isotopic exchange during the snow melting zhou et al 2008 using d of 4 6 for the ism 19 4 for the westerlies and the discharge weighted average of 9 2 for the nyang river at gbvd the two member isotopic balance eqs 1 2 requires 24 34 of river water is derived from the westerlies or winter snow it is thus reasonable to expect that the snowmelt is characterized by remarkably higher δ18o and d relative to the ism rainfall and baseflow over the nrb since the isotopic seasonality in precipitation displays coherence in a large space within a climate domain glacier melt on the setp is derived from the glacier ice melt ism rainfall and snowmelt in ablation zones of glaciers zhu et al 2017 the result from the zuoqiupu ice core drilled from the setp shows conspicuous seasonal fluctuations in δ18o concentrating from 18 9 summer precipitation to 10 1 winter precipitation with an average of 14 4 zhao et al 2017 and this average value may approximately reflect the average glacier ice melt in the region direct glacier melt on the setp was also collected in a previous study showing average δ18o and d of 16 3 and 15 5 respectively n 6 ren et al 2017 lower δ18o and d of glacier melt than snowmelt appear to occur widely in regions of the setp and himalayas for example in eastern nepal central himalayas the average δ18o and d of glacier melt are 15 7 and 13 1 while those of snowmelt are 7 9 and 17 6 respectively voss et al 2020 in a sub basin of the upper ganges western himalayas average δ18o and d of glacier melt are 12 6 and 18 8 respectively while those of precipitation in the winter half year are 7 4 and 23 3 respectively kumar et al 2018 therefore glacier melt shows intermediate δ18o and d values between snowmelt and ism rainfall within a broad high altitude region where the ism and westerlies dominate seasonally taken together meltwater especially snowmelt and ism rainfall on the setp differ greatly in isotopic signals δ18o and d which can be used to separate their effects on river runoff 4 2 river discharge and isotopic responses to temperature and precipitation over the study period to assess how river discharge and isotopic signals respond to temperature and precipitation over the study period we evaluated relationships among variables using simple correlation analysis and the results are presented in table 1 it shows that river discharge increases significantly with temperature with lapse rates of 25 9 m3 c r 2 0 18 p 0 001 27 1 m3 c r 2 0 32 p 0 002 and 44 3 m3 c r 2 0 62 p 0 036 on event weekly and monthly basis respectively the increasing discharge with temperature is typically observed in high latitude snowmelt driven catchments where higher temperatures would cause accelerated snow melting and hence greater river discharge serreze et al 2000 yang et al 2002 however such a hydrological regime cannot be the case for the nrb as ism rainfall accounts for the majority of annual precipitation here the general overlap of the summer melting and rainy seasons implies the increasing discharge with t air cannot be simply interpreted as a result of the meltwater effect on the other hand we also found river discharge increases significantly with precipitation on weekly and monthly basis with lapse rates of 6 2 m3 mm r 2 0 41 p 0 001 and 2 6 m3 mm r 2 0 73 p 0 015 respectively regarding the positive p t air relationship r 0 42 p 0 030 on a weekly basis r 0 79 p 0 035 on a monthly basis it is necessary to conduct partial correlation analysis to evaluate the bivariate q t air q p relationship to remove the additional influence of p t air still strong q t air and q p relationships on a weekly basis are achieved r 0 42 p 0 032 r 0 56 p 0 003 respectively and the higher q p correlation here suggests rainfall relatively more influences the river runoff than meltwater the selected multiple stepwise linear regression model for the weekly data confirms temperature and precipitation are both important predictors of river discharge together explaining 54 of its variation these results provide direct evidence that the discharge of the nyang river has a strong reliance on temperature and precipitation simultaneously which separately reflect the meltwater and rainfall effects over the drainage for river isotopic data one of the prominent findings is that d riv increases strongly with t air on event and weekly basis table 1 with lapse rates of 1 18 c r 2 0 24 p 0 001 and 1 86 c r 2 0 40 p 0 001 respectively in phase with the positive q t air relationship and remarkably high d of meltwater relative to ism rainfall and baseflow over the basin the increasing d riv with t air likely corresponds to the increasing meltwater proportion in river runoff moreover it is notable that d ppt decreases significantly with t air on all event weekly and monthly basis r 0 63 p 0 001 r 0 73 p 0 001 r 0 87 p 0 011 figures not shown and this provides additional evidence that the positive q t air relationship does reflect the meltwater effect as greater rainfall input at higher temperatures from the positive p t air relationship would tend to decrease d riv contradicting the observation encountered here on the other hand the linkage between river runoff and precipitation is clearly indicated by the positive δ18oriv δ18oppt relationship on each temporal basis table 1 and the increasing δ18oriv with δ18oppt can be explained by the increasing rainfall proportion in river runoff accordingly additionally the isotopic amount effect in precipitation over the study area fig s1 may partly contribute to this relationship because greater rainfall runoff due to higher precipitation with lower δ18oppt would tend to decrease δ18oriv these results suggest that river water d and δ18o potentially separately track the meltwater and rainfall effects on river runoff over the drainage river discharge and isotopic signals are representative of earlier precipitation and meltwater information to address this effect the aforementioned relationships using data prior to the in situ measurements were evaluated the time lag was set from 0 to 5 weeks and the results are compiled in table s2 it shows that the correlation is significant at various lags for q t air while at lags of 0 3 weeks for q p the correlation for both initially increases and then decreases with the maximum largest response at the lag of 1 week r 0 62 p 0 001 and 2 weeks r 0 69 p 0 001 respectively for river isotopic data correlation is significant at lags of 0 2 weeks for d riv t air but 0 5 weeks for δ18oppt δ18oriv the correlation for d riv t air displays the same variation trend as that for q t air also with the maximum at the lag of 1 week r 0 77 p 0 001 in contrast the correlation for δ18oppt δ18oriv displays a similar variation trend to that for p q but the highest occurs 1 week later at 3 weeks lag thus either from the river discharge or isotopic point of view the largest response of river runoff to temperature further meltwater takes place 1 2 weeks earlier than to rainfall consistent with the great complexity in the rainfall runoff relative to the meltwater runoff processes freeze 1974 sivakumar et al 2001 4 3 seasonal dynamics in dominant runoff sources the covariation of cumulative q and p at the study site reveals three consecutive hydrological phases for the nyang river fig 4b which do not completely match with the precipitation phases since the time point of the second seasonal transfer occurs in the middle ism season the hydrological phase division is strongly supported by the unique isotope discharge pattern fig 5 δ18oriv and d riv increase with discharge in q1 δ18oriv and d riv decrease with discharge in q2 and δ18oriv and d riv show muted variation trends with discharge in q3 this isotope discharge pattern is undoubtedly associated with unique season specific discharge regimes involving different water sources and or their relative contributions to river runoff in the pre ism season also q1 the river is fed mainly by baseflow and meltwater and we speculated that meltwater is the key driver of river discharge and isotopic changes given that baseflow is usually steady and has small variations in isotopic composition over time this is confirmed by the simultaneous increases in q δ18oriv and d riv with t air fig 6 a c because meltwater either snowmelt and glacier melt is featured by much higher δ18o an d values than baseflow the increases in δ18oriv and d riv with discharge here can be ascribed to the increases in meltwater proportion in river runoff from early april to mid june as temperature rises from 5 to 15 c and the highest δ18oriv d riv in mid june should correspond to the greatest meltwater proportion accordingly by contrast the occasionally occurring rains in this period may preferentially replenish the soil water storage liu et al 2017 yang et al 2003 and has minimal influences on river discharge fig 2 after the monsoon onset from mid june on both rainfall and river discharge increase significantly while δ18oriv and d riv turn to progressively decline within q2 fig 2 the river isotopic changes clearly reflect the substantial water input from ism rainfall that is featured by low δ18o and d values though higher temperature and rainfall would accelerate snow and glacier melting boral et al 2019 doyle et al 2015 it is difficult to evaluate the temporal variability in the meltwater and ism rainfall contributions in q2 at this present stage but the coupled increasing decreasing ism rainfall meltwater proportion in river runoff and increasing river discharge is likely the mechanisms responsible for the decreasing trend of δ18oriv d riv with discharge fig 5 the insignificant relationships between t air and q δ18oriv and d riv fig 6d f but strong and positive relationship between δ18oriv and δ18oppt fig 7 b provide additional evidence that ism rainfall more influences river runoff than meltwater the lowest highest δ18oriv and d riv with the maximum minimum discharge at the end start of q2 thus represent the largest smallest ism rainfall contribution to river runoff early august is another important transition time as river discharge turns to decrease while δ18oriv and d riv vary slightly with time fig 2 in addition to the overall declining rainfall the declining meltwater is another potential cause of the decreasing river discharge in q3 from late spring on snow melts at a high rate so that the percentage of snow cover area in the basin decreases to a low value in july on average from 47 in january april to 12 in july zhang et al 2021 leading to decreasing meltwater runoff afterward the present result suggests that there is no significant relationship between t air and q δ18oriv and d riv fig 6g i and between δ18oriv and δ18oppt fig 7c highlighting neither rainfall nor meltwater can be the key factor of river runoff changes nevertheless we noted intense rains still induce apparent increases in river discharge in this period fig 2 which can be somewhat reflected by the isotopic data concerning the marginally significant δ18oriv δ18oppt relationship fig 7c we therefore argue that rainfall still more influences the river runoff than meltwater in this period 4 4 quantification of seasonal runoff source contributors to rigorously test the seasonal runoff source relationships inferred above we estimated the season specific fractional contributions of runoff sources by constructing a three member mixing model using a dual tracer δ18o and d approach eqs 3 5 δ2h was not chosen because δ18o and δ2h of river water and precipitation are highly correlated fig 3 and δ18o and d show a low degree of covariance since a dual isotope approach was employed only three sources can be considered phillips and gregg 2003 in q1 three sources namely baseflow snowmelt and glacier melt were considered in q2 and q3 combining snowmelt and glacier melt into a single component three sources of rainfall meltwater and baseflow were considered these simplifications make the number of potential sources reduce to three in each period the δ18oriv and d riv values were measured directly baseflow was assumed to equal river water in early april and be constant in isotopic composition as d ppt is primarily related to moisture source and has a rather minor dependence on sampling location the weighted average d ppt at gbvd was used to represent the catchment d ppt by contrast δ18oppt is strongly altitude dependent and the catchment δ18oppt was obtained from the δ18oppt lapse rate of 0 33 100 m yao et al 2009 weighted average δ18oppt at gbvd and mean catchment altitude of 5300 masl estimated from the dem data literature and our data were compiled together to yield average δ18o and d values of snowmelt and glacier melt which were assumed to be invariant over time the data for calculations and results are presented in table 2 the baseflow has a fraction of 72 11 while the meltwater has a fraction of 28 26 9 for snowmelt and 2 11 for glacier melt in q1 this result coincides with the sharp increase in δ18oriv and d riv with discharge fig 5 as a small input of meltwater may lead to an apparent increase in δ18oriv and d riv as for the considerable isotopic difference between meltwater especially snowmelt and baseflow the much higher fraction of snowmelt than glacier melt agrees with the common knowledge about the much larger area of snow cover than glaciers in spring early summer over the basin zhang et al 2021 even in glaciated catchments glacier ice is less exposed than snow in spring early summer and snowmelt forms a major contributor of meltwater as observed in the western himalayas jeelani et al 2017 rai et al 2019 and alps penna et al 2017 the rather high fraction of baseflow is possibly related to the high catchment vegetation cover that could sustain a large groundwater reservoir especially for altitudes 5200 masl where shrubland or meadowland dominates jin et al 2019 the estimated fractions here also partly explain the quadratic δ18oriv d riv discharge pattern in q1 fig 5 if the river was fed by baseflow and snowmelt only snowmelt would drive the river discharge and isotopic changes leading to overall linear isotope discharge patterns as observed in the pan arctic region st amour et al 2005 yi et al 2010 yi et al 2012 and several german drainages reckerth et al 2017 for the nrb since glacier melt has intermediate δ18o and d values between snowmelt and baseflow and the overturns occur in late spring early summer when glaciers begin to melt intensively the glacier melt input would likely lower the δ18o and d of the snowmelt baseflow mixture thereby causing quadratic isotope discharge patterns as expected ism rainfall and meltwater become major contributors in q2 with fractions of 48 21 and 41 9 respectively and the baseflow fraction decreases sharply to 11 23 based on the calculated results average runoff source discharges can be obtained where baseflow discharge varies from 53 to 48 m3 s and meltwater discharge from 21 to 177 m3 s from q1 to q2 in line with our expected steady baseflow but significant increases of meltwater as temperature rises assuming the river was fed by rainfall snowmelt and glacier melt regarding the very low baseflow fraction the same approach was used to partition the snowmelt and glacier melt contributions and the result also highlights a much higher fraction of snowmelt 35 than glacier melt 7 notably the total meltwater fractions are almost the same whether baseflow is considered or not 41 vs 42 verifying the correctness of the isotope mixing model and endmember isotopic data employed here these provide robust and quantitative evidence that the proportional mixing between ism rainfall and meltwater is the major catchment hydrological process in q2 but the ism rainfall should be the determinant of δ18oriv fig 7b as well as the negative δ18oriv d riv discharge pattern fig 5 owing to its large amount and much lower δ18o and d relative to meltwater rainfall and meltwater fractions decline to 32 15 and 25 15 respectively whereas baseflow fraction increases to 43 19 in q3 the proportional mixing among such three sources becomes the major catchment hydrological process and their relative contributions to river runoff likely do not change greatly concerning the small river isotopic magnitudes and muted isotope discharge patterns fig 5 it is difficult to explore why the baseflow fraction increases remarkably from q2 to q3 11 vs 43 in lack of long term groundwater data besides the reductions in rainfall and meltwater inputs the possibility still exists that groundwater is more recharged by recent rains thereby leading to an underestimated rainfall fraction but overestimated baseflow fraction and this hypothesis seems to be supported by the large increase in average baseflow discharge from q2 to q3 48 vs 92 m3 s a further well thought experimental design for monitoring the isotopic data of catchment groundwater is needed to interrogate such a hypothesis also to compare snowmelt and glacier melt contributions we combined rainfall and baseflow into a single component by simply taking their average values and the result of the three member mixing model suggests glacier melt is not the contributor with a minus fraction and snowmelt has a fraction of 25 therefore our dataset indicates that the snowmelt makes a major contribution to meltwater throughout the whole study period the isotope based contribution estimations here carry large uncertainties because there are many assumptions and the isotopic values of water sources are not well constrained due to the limited data for example the isotopic values of meltwater would vary with snowmelt vs glacier melt input in q2 and q3 but invariant isotopic values were assigned the isotopic values of glacier melt and snowmelt may vary with the sampling location and timing but averages of limited data were used which may make the results somewhat biased nevertheless the estimated results are in close agreement with our river discharge and isotopic observations in each hydrological period we emphasize that this is ongoing research and with growing isotopic data of runoff sources over the region the application of the isotopic mass balance model would help better determine their relative contributions to total river runoff 5 conclusion the nyang river illustrates the complexity of interpreting seasonal changes in river discharge and isotopic signals particularly in the high altitude region of the setp where both snowmelt and ism rainfall play significant roles the close relationships of river discharge with both temperature and precipitation corroborate the hypothesis that the river is featured by a combined meltwater rainfall discharge regime further statistical correlation analysis reveals a great potential to employ river water d excess and δ18o data to track the separate effects of meltwater and rainfall on river runoff based on the seasonal patterns of river discharge and isotopic signals we found meltwater is the key factor of river runoff changes in the pre ism season low water level period ism rainfall in the early to mid ism season growing and high water level period but key factors are not clear in the mid to post ism season recession period while applying a season specific dual tracer δ18o and d mixing model approach the estimated results show agreement with the inferred runoff source relationships in each hydrological period specifically meltwater is found to generate 28 41 and 25 of the total river runoff and snowmelt makes much higher contributions to the meltwater than glacier melt throughout the whole study period these observations improve our understanding of seasonal dynamics of river discharge and isotopic signals on the setp we propose that long term river water isotopic records δ18o and d over the region will likely document catchment hydrological changes in runoff source relationships that are closely linked to temperature and precipitation through their controls on the meltewater and rainfall runoff if for example the timing or extent of catchment meltwater and ism rainfall changes this will be directly reflected in river water δ18o and d

2271,the composite fingerprinting approach is valuable in sediment source identification at different temporal and spatial scales however few studies have estimated watershed sediment source connections and transport impacted by multiple check dams this is due to the complexity of particle sorting under flood discharge practices here we attempt to identify sediment sources with three connected check dams in an agricultural mollisol catchment in northeast china based on optimal fingerprints screened from different size fractions i e 10 63 and 1000 μm the results showed consistent sediment contributions based on fine particle size ranges i e 10 and 63 μm but an inconsistent contribution based on a coarse particle size range i e 1000 μm regardless of the particle size or the organic corrections applied sediment deposited in check dams no 1 and no 2 was mainly from hillslopes cropland 66 7 while sediment in check dam no 3 was from its adjacent upstream check dam i e no 2 60 5 based on optimal fingerprints screened from 10 and 63 μm particle size ranges however when fingerprints were screened from a coarse particle size 1000 μm sediment in all three check dams was mainly from gully slopes 79 0 regardless of the specific surface area ssa of particles or the soil organic carbon soc correction factors used in the model except for soc correction for check dam no 2 conversely sediment was mainly derived from hillslopes when fingerprint values were corrected using ssa and soc except that no optimal fingerprints were selected this indicated the feasibility of sediment source discrimination based on the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source identification in catchments with a series of connected check dams under the condition that particle fractions impacted by check dams are relatively weak however optimal fingerprints screened from a relatively wide range of coarse particles caused divergent results regardless of the particle size or the organic correction factors used in model estimation or in fingerprint values further studies are necessary to explore the reliability of the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source tracing under a series of connected check dams where coarse sediment is selectively deposited and fine sediment is massively discharged under flood discharge practices keywords composite fingerprinting approach particle fraction virtual sediment mixture particle correction organic matter correction data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction sediment source identification as one of the significant aspects in soil erosion research is critical for tracing sediment sources nutrients and contaminants it is also important to identify associated influencing factors reveal variations in erosion rates and patterns and assess the influence of anthropogenic activities on environmental health thus it is valuable for the improvement of soil water conservation measures and environmental management collins et al 2017 tang et al 2019 sediment being a product of soil erosion can be used to identify soil characteristics in source areas this provides a basic foundation for tracing sediment sources alongside transported nutrients and contaminants using the composite fingerprinting approach sediment sources from small watersheds to large river systems or those from intra erosional events over several centuries can be determined using the composite fingerprinting approach through source classification optimal fingerprints screening and contribution estimation hughes et al 2009 nosrati et al 2021 walling and woodward 1995 to obtain robust sediment source results fingerprints should be detectable and behave conservatively during transport which include different types of natural and artificially derived organic and inorganic properties collins et al 2020 martínez carreras et al 2010 owens et al 2016 however sediment particle sorting and associated value variations in fingerprints are key aspects that influence the reliability and accuracy of sediment source identification laceby et al 2017 this is because source area soil is less impacted by sorting while sediment is a selectively transported product of runoff flow rates and wind whose sorting features are also affected by factors such as landform vegetation and land use types peng et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 this causes differences in particle fractions and soil properties that could be used as fingerprints to distinguish between source soil and sediment additionally types of soil properties may be either enriched or depleted within different particle fractions leading to sediment source estimation bias li and pang 2014 tang et al 2014 thus previous studies have proposed the following recommendations 1 screening optimal fingerprints from finer particles within a relatively narrow range i e 10 and 63 μm and 2 adopting particle and organic correction factors in contribution estimation models buyang et al 2019 haddadchi et al 2016 koiter et al 2018 fine particles are normally chosen this is because a considerable amount of nutrients geochemical elements radionuclides and contaminants are transported alongside fine particle fractions 63 μm koiter et al 2018 laceby et al 2017 fingerprints obtained from finer particles have also been shown to cause less bias compared to coarse particles in sediment source identification at both fluvial system and watershed scales batista et al 2019 sherriff et al 2015 for fluvial systems suspended sediment is typically composed of hydraulically derived well filtered fine particles almost all being 125 μm and dominated by a particle size range 63 μm belmont et al 2014 phillips and walling 1999 this has provided a baseline for identifying suspended sediment in rivers based on particle sizes 63 μm thus differences in grain size and associated fingerprints between source soil and sediment are typically larger compared to suspended sediment in fluvial systems allen et al 2017 jia et al 2016 however sediment particles deposited on riverbeds or trapped by check dams reservoirs ponds and low lying areas are typically relatively coarse particles with a wide range of grain sizes this causes sediment source identification to be subject to relatively significant uncertainty to decrease the uncertainty caused by particle sorting sediment source studies using the composite fingerprinting approach at the watershed scale have almost all focused on check dams or reservoirs furthermost upstream huang et al 2019 nosrati and collins 2021 zhang et al 2020 in other words few sediment source studies have focused on a series of constructed check dams or reservoirs in watersheds or those located further downstream in gullies check dams are typically constructed in series to trap eroded sediment raise the erosional base level control water flow decrease flow energy and restore degraded land the functions and effects of these series of check dams perform far better than those of a single check dam abbasi et al 2019 stavi et al 2020 wang et al 2021 previous studies have analyzed the impacts of these series constructed check dams on sediment sources erosion and hydraulic processes using methods that include field investigations model simulations and topographic measurements alfonso torreno et al 2019 dicenzo and luk 1997 wei et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 however few studies have explored sediment sources trapped behind a series of check dams this is because the redistribution of sediment trapped behind a series of check dams causes complex or even unpredictable changes in particle fractions additionally the unpredictable changes in particle fractions will lead to different variations in soil properties moreover when no flood discharge facilities have been constructed to check dams all eroded soil will be trapped behind them in such cases sediment source identification is typically based on whether flood couplets had any observable coarse fine deposition changes chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 however for check dams equipped with flood discharge facilities flood discharge will exhibit obvious course sediment deposition and fine sediment discharge effects vaezi et al 2017 flood discharge not only enhances particle sorting effects but also increases the impact that upstream check dams have on downstream check dams in this case it is difficult to identify the sediment deposited trapped behind these check dams the chinese mollisol region is one of the country s most important crop production zones severe soil loss in this agricultural dominated zone is attributed to the additive effects of multiple erosion agents long sloping landforms sticky soils concentrated rainstorms and intense anthropogenic activities cui et al 2007 xu et al 2010 sheet and rill hillslope erosion and overland flow concentrations have promoted the development of gullies these gullies not only damage cropland but also obstruct cultivation machinery thus gully erosion is treated as a destructive and dramatic form of land degradation in northeast china shen et al 2018 wen et al 2021 for decades various types of measures have been used to control gully erosion such as constructing a series of check dams in gully channels and to prevent sloping erosion to reduce erosion intensity in agricultural catchments within this zone liu et al 2019 shen et al 2020 therefore sediment source identification in these agricultural catchments is critical in the establishment of soil conservation measures to effectively control severe soil erosion previous studies have discriminated sediment sources from gullies and hillslopes in watersheds using sediment collected from gully beds or deposited in reservoirs in the mollisol region of northeast china chen et al 2021 fang 2015 huang et al 2019 2022 however few of these studies have focused on a series of check dams which has adversely affected our understanding of how a series of check dams can effectuate sediment control it has also restrained our understanding of how to improve the arrangement of check dams accordingly this study selected an agricultural catchment with a series of stone check dams to identify sediment sources deposited in each check dam affected by landforms i e hillslope and gully slope the specific objectives were to assess the feasibility of the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source studies under a series of check dams to clarify the impact that particle size has on sediment source identification and to analyze the effect of particle and organic corrections in the contribution estimation model or in fingerprint values on sediment source contributions the results from this study will help us better understand the effectiveness of a series of check dams on sediment transport in the chinese mollisol region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xinmin catchment 12 54 7 06 e 48 4 16 42 n is a typical agricultural catchment located in keshan county heilongjiang province china typical rolling hills characterize the landform of the catchment and its average elevation ranges from 160 m to 220 m amsl from east to west according to records from the keshan meteorological station 1951 2019 the average annual temperature is approx 2 c with a maximum average of 21 c in july and a minimum average of 22 c in january local weather is subject to obvious annual and interannual changes with a prolonged cold season the annual precipitation averages 510 7 mm most of which approx 82 falls between june and september the soil type of the catchment is mollisol according to the keys to soil taxonomy usda nrcs which corresponds to chernozem according to world soil resources reports from the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations un fao 2015 soil survey staff 2014 the bulk density averaged 1 20 g cm 3 in the tillage layer the main local crops planted are rotational maize zea mays and soybean glycine max l merr applying contour farming practices both crops are sown in late april to early may on ridges the area of this agricultural catchment is 1 75 km2 dominated by sloping cropland ranging from approx 1 to 7 artificial forest dominated by populus alba populus alba p berolinensis was planted on relatively gentle gully slopes approx 22 in 2006 at the same time as the stone check dams were constructed while steep gully slopes approx 22 37 were left bare for this study the sampling area above the check dams was 0 15 km2 in a small catchment with an area of 0 25 km2 three levels of check dams were selected at the uppermost upstream area of the gully to identify sediment sources affected by a series of check dams they were check dams no 1 no 2 and no 3 in an upstream to downstream direction the dam heights are 1 2 1 2 and 1 4 m for check dams no 1 to no 3 the widths are 6 5 7 4 and 13 0 m and the distances to the gully head are approx 77 100 and 140 m respectively none of the individual check dams in this series were equipped with flood discharge facilities flow and sediment are transported in an upstream to downstream direction through rectangularly shaped hollowed out areas 0 3 m height fig 1 this decreases coarse sediment deposits and fine sediment discharge compared to that occurring in check dams with flood discharge facilities satisfying a key condition of this study li et al 2010 an unpaved agricultural road goes almost parallel to the gully however sediment and runoff were scarcely transported into the gully in all areas except for the bottom of the gully i e the low lying area of the catchment this is because soil compaction by farm machinery ephemeral gully erosion of the road and vegetation protection to the gully edge resulted in the road being slightly lower than adjacent cropland and 15 20 cm lower than the gully edge thus sediment from the unpaved road was not a potential source for sediment deposited in the three levels of check dams 2 2 soil sampling and analysis this study selected the three uppermost upstream check dams to analyze sediment sources trapped behind each dam source samples were randomly collected separately at the upstream area of each stone check dam surface soil 0 5 cm was collected considering the variation in landform and land use types as well as the relatively spatially uniform distribution of the sampling sites source samples were collected at a depth of 5 cm this was due to the relatively severe erosion attributed to multiple erosion agents and the intensive cultivation that takes place in the chinese mollisol region zhang et al 2022a within the dam field a pit was dug 2 m from each of the three check dams at a 50 cm depth depth incremental soil samples were collected at a depth of 5 cm because no visible coarse fine flood formed sedimentary layer was identifiable in total 11 9 and 16 samples were collected from hillslopes i e cropland at the upstream area of all three check dams while 14 10 and 13 samples were collected from the gully slope respectively according to overland flow discharge rates in july 2019 fig 1 in total 73 source samples and 30 sediment samples were collected all source and sediment samples were ultrasonically dispersed after being air dried ground and passed through 2 mm screens to remove litter and root material following this different particle fractions i e 10 63 and 1000 μm were classified considering variation in particle fractions of mollisol at source areas and deposited sediment the main particle fractions should be included in sediment source identification haddadchi et al 2016 malhotra et al 2020 particles were classified into different ranges using wet sieving and centrifugation techniques after soil aggregates were dispersed via the ultrasonic method wet sieving was conducted to obtain 63 μm and 1000 μm particle size ranges after which centrifugation was used to separate particles into a 10 μm particle size range the centrifugal rotational speed duration and soil suspension concentration were selected through preliminary experiments based on stokes law potential fingerprinting tracer values were tested in all source soil and sediment samples that were separated into these different grain size ranges soil organic carbon soc g kg content was determined using the potassium dichromate external heating method tang et al 2012 zhang et al 2022a geochemical elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms to dissolve most minerals in the samples each sample was digested by multiple acid hno3 hclo4 hf fuming dried and dissolved in hcl there were 45 geochemical elements were analyzed including mo cu pb zn ag ni co mn fe as u th sr cd sb bi v ca p la cr mg ba ti al na k w zr ce sn y nb ta be sc li s rb hf in re se te and tl the specific surface area ssa was measured using a mastersizer 2000 instrument malvern instruments malvern uk after soil organic matter and calcium carbonate were removed using a chemical method h2o2 and hcl for a particle size range of 1000 μm 2 3 selection of optimal fingerprint groups the wet sieving and centrifugation results showed that 10 μm particles accounted for 48 7 5 8 and 49 3 5 7 respectively in source soil and sediment samples 10 63 μm particles accounted for 36 5 4 3 and 37 0 4 9 respectively while 63 1000 μm particles accounted for 14 8 this indicated that both 10 and 10 63 μm particles are the main fraction in sediment transport thus this study determined the sediment source using 10 and 63 μm particles taking the bulk sample i e 1000 μm as a comparison therefore this study screened for optimal fingerprint groups within grain size ranges of 10 63 and 1000 μm based on the composite fingerprinting approach before conducting sediment contribution estimations the screening procedure for optimal fingerprint groups involved four main steps the first step was classifying source groups based on factors that were mainly responsible for the variation in soil properties this priori source grouping results were cross checked with information obtained from field investigations including landforms local cultivation and management patterns and erosion types evrard et al 2022 the results of source grouping are also reclassified using cluster analysis pulley et al 2017 the second step was to identify potential fingerprints using the kruskal wallis h test the third step was to confirm the conservative behavior of the fingerprints that passed the kruskal wallis h test using a range test and a variability ratio analysis i e intergroup to intragroup variability laceby et al 2017 owens et al 2016 the fourth step was to assess the discriminatory power of tracers using discriminant function analysis dfa based on wilks s lambda distribution wilk s λ it was also necessary to produce biplots based on principal component analysis pca to ensure the distribution consistency of the final selected tracers between sediment and source samples which ultimately confirmed the optimal fingerprint groups fig s1 gellis and walling 2013 koiter et al 2013 this study classified potential sediment sources into hillslope i e cropland and gully slope given that sediment from hillsope and gully was the main sediment sources in the chinese mollisol region fang 2015 zhang et al 2022b moreover previous studies successfully identified these two sources using geochemical elements huang et al 2019 2020 this study carefully selected source classification schemes to identify sediment contributions from hillslope and gully slope behind each check dam and to understand sediment source connection and transport impacted by multiple check dams this is because sediment source classification significantly impacts the accuracy of source determination pulley et al 2017 vercruysse and grabowski 2018 this study determined a more appropriate scheme by comparing two source classification schemes the first scheme classified sediment sources into hillslope and gully slope for each check dam schme 1 in other words hillslope and gully slope samples for check dam no 1 were collected from s1 and g1 partitions samples for check dam no 2 were collected from s1 s2 and g1 g2 partitions and hillslope and gully slope samples were collected from g1 g2 g3 and s1 s2 s3 partitions for check dam no 3 the subareas on the hillslope i e s1 s2 s3 were roughly divided based on runoff path while the subareas of the gully slope i e g1 g2 g3 were distinctly separated by the location of check dams the hillslope could be roughly divided into three subareas for three levels of check dams this is because hillslopes are croplands adopting the same tillage and management practices which did not lead to significant variation in fingerprinting properties attributed to human activities this source classification scheme ignored the effects of upstream check dams i e check dams no 1 and no 2 on downstream check dams i e check dams no 2 and no 3 this allowed the eroded soil to be directly transported into check dams no 2 and no 3 which is not consistent with real world conditions the second scheme classified sediment sources for check dam no 1 into hillslope s1 and gully slope g1 as well while classified sediment sources into hillslope gully slope and upstream check dam sediment for check dams no 2 and no 3 thus sediment sources for check dam no 2 were hillslope s2 gully slope g2 and sediment from check dam no 1 while they were hillslope s3 gully slope g3 and sediment from check dam no 2 in check dam no 3 schme 2 fig 2 in this classification scheme deposited sediment in upstream check dams no 1 and no 2 was a source for adjacent downstream check dams no 2 and no 3 although this corresponds to real world conditions this scheme may cause confusion during source discrimination this is because deposited sediment in the check dams is a mixture from hillslope and gully slope areas 2 4 sediment source contribution estimation based on the optimal fingerprint groups in each grain size range we estimated the contribution of potential sources to sediment deposits using a multivariate mixing model which minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals r es for the tracers involved gellis and walling 2013 particle and organic correction factors were adopted in the estimation model when the optimal fingerprint groups were selected from a coarse particle i e 1000 μm to reduce estimation bias this study adopted specific surface area ssa as the particle correction factor and adopted organic carbon content soc as the organic correction factor this is because both ssa and soc had relatively high correlations with the chemical reactivity of elements and proved to be effective factors in sediment contribution correction laceby et al 2017 gaspar et al 2022 the multivariate mixing models are expressed as follows for particle size ranges of 10 63 and 1000 μm 1 r es f 1 n c f s 1 m p s s sf c f 2 for a particle size range of 1000 μm 2 r es f 1 n c f s

the number of potential sediment sources cf is the concentration or value of factor f in the sediment ps is the proportional contribution of sediment from potential source s ssf is the average value of factor f in potential source s when all detectable parameters obey a normal distribution according to quantile quantile q q plots using spss 19 0 and zs is a particle correction factor i e the ratio of the specific sediment surface area to that of the source material the ssa for a particle fraction 1000 μm was obtained to assess the effect of particle sorting on sediment source discrimination os is an organic matter content correction factor i e the soc ratio of sediment to that of the source soil particle and organic matter content corrections were not applied for particle fractions 10 and 63 μm this was due to the high risk of overcorrection during particle correction of fingerprints for fine particles which could cause increased concentration differences between sediment and source samples koiter et al 2018 this model was used under constraints namely that the contribution of each source must be nonnegative and the total contribution must sum to 1 collins et al 1997 this study used a genetic algorithm in combination with monte carlo simulation analysis to obtain sediment source contributions collins et al 2012 haddadchi et al 2013 5000 monte carlo iterations were applied as a surrogate for conventional random sampling in combination with genetic algorithm optimization to obtain accurate contributions moreover contribution uncertainties attributed to fingerprints and mixing model optimization were estimated by incorporating monte carlo analysis into the optimization routines of the mixing model sample means and the relative standard deviation sd of tracers for each potential source within all selected grain size ranges were estimated using a bootstrap procedure this was conducted to infer the statistical distribution of tracers on the basis that analytical errors and the variability of tracers based on the sampling regime of each source area can be used to represent the overall source we also used t test to analyze the uncertainty of sediment source contributions walling 2013 source apportionment modeling outputs were tested using goodness of fit gof based on the mean absolute error manjoro et al 2017 the accuracy of the unmixing model predictions was assessed using virtual sediment mixtures vsms gaspar et al 2022 gholami et al 2020 the results between the known source proportion and model estimation were compared using root mean square error rmse gof and rmse were calculated as follows 5 gof 1 n 1 f 1 n c f s 1 m p s s f s c f 2 6 rmse 1 m f 1 m p known p predicted 2 where pknown is the known percentage source contribution in the vsms and ppredicted is the percentage source contribution predicted eq 5 must also satisfy constraints namely that the contribution of each source must be nonnegative and the total contribution must sum to 1 palazón et al 2015 sediment source estimation results obtained by the mixing model were considered acceptable when the gof value was 80 mckinley et al 2013 additionally to clarify the impact of fingerprints from the coarse particle fraction i e 1000 μm on sediment source identification we compared sediment source contribution differences based on different correction methods the contributions included results from a multivariate mixing model with i e eqs 2 4 and with no i e eq 1 particle and organic corrections and results from corrected particle and organic matter in fingerprint values eqs 7 9 combined with eq 1 the particle size correction factor cssa corr the organic matter correction factor csoc corr and the combined correction to particle size and organic matter cssa soc corr of fingerprint values were calculated as follows koiter et al 2018 7 c s s a corr c f z s 8 c s o c corr c f o s 9 c ssa s o c corr c f z s o s 3 results 3 1 changes in optimal fingerprint values within different grain size ranges optimal fingerprint groups within different grain size ranges for each of the three check dams were screened according to the aforementioned procedures the results showed that the cumulative correct source discrimination based on classification schme 1 was relatively low compared to schme 2 specifically optimal fingerprint groups based on schme 1 provided a cumulative correct source discrimination of 74 4 when particle sizes were 63 μm and 1000 μm while ranging from 84 7 to 95 3 when the particle size range was 10 μm however for all particle sizes the cumulative correct source discrimination ranged from 89 3 to 100 based on optimal fingerprint groups selected using schme 2 table 1 thus schme 2 was used in this study there was a decreasing trend in cumulative correct source discrimination as the particle size increased which was also the trend for check dams in an upstream to downstream direction i e no 1 through no 3 cumulative correct source discrimination decreased from 100 to 89 3 with an increase in particle size and gradually decreased from 100 to 92 3 in an upstream to downstream direction i e no 1 through no 3 in total 20 elements were included in the optimal fingerprint groups of the three check dams screened from three particle size ranges i e 10 63 and 1000 μm nine of these elements ba ca mg mn na u v w and y were detected in different fingerprint groups table 1 these nine elements were consequently used as examples to analyze the distribution characteristics of elements affected by particle size these nine elements were classified into three groups based on their variations in different particle size ranges the results showed that ca mg v w and y were enriched in particle size ranges of 10 and 63 μm compared to that of 1000 μm in both source hillslope and gully slope and sediment samples for all three check dams however certain elements i e v w and y in samples collected from the hillslope area of check dam no 3 were depleted in the 63 μm particle range fig 3 a e although na was depleted in the 10 μm particle range it was enriched in the 63 μm particle range fig 3 f compared to that of the 1000 μm particle range in both source and sediment samples in all three check dams the remaining elements ba mn and u were primarily enriched in the 10 μm particle range fig 3 g i this indicated that the characteristic distribution trend of representative fingerprints was similar among source and sediment samples 3 2 sediment source apportionment in all three check dams based on different particle size ranges based on different grain size ranges sediment contributions varied among the three check dams optimal fingerprints selected from fine particles i e 10 and 63 μm showed that sediment behind check dams no 1 and no 2 was primarily from the hillslope cropland area while it was dominated by sediment deposited in its adjacent upstream check dam i e no 2 for check dam no 3 cropland contributed 66 7 of the sediment in check dams no 1 and no 2 while it only accounted for between 29 6 and 39 2 in check dam no 3 respectively based on fingerprints from 10 and 63 μm particle ranges from an upstream to downstream direction check dam no 1 contributed between 27 4 and 70 1 of sediment to adjacent downstream check dams i e no 2 and no 3 however optimal fingerprints selected from 1000 μm particle range indicated that sediment in all three check dams was primarily from the gully slope area 88 7 while barely any sediment was transported in the check dam constructed gully in an upstream to downstream direction i e from check dam no 1 to check dams no 2 and no 3 fig 4 this is contrary to common sense given that water carries sediment as it flows through gully systems thus variations in sediment contributions based on optimal fingerprints from the different grain size ranges showed that source contributions obtained using particle fractions 10 and 63 μm were consistent while they were opposite to those estimated based on a particle range 1000 μm these predicted source contributions adopting the mixing model algorithm approach were acceptable this is because from check dam no 1 to no 3 the gof for sediment source estimation decreased from 95 9 to 89 2 on the condition of the particle range 1000 μm while it decreased from 97 1 to 91 1 on the condition of particle ranges 10 and 63 μm the sediment source differences based on fine and coarse particles implied a high estimation bias potential of sediment contribution using optimal fingerprints from a coarse particle fraction without correcting for particle sorting or organic matter content 4 discussion 4 1 effects of particle size and organic matter content on sediment source apportionment according to model correction particle size and organic matter content are two key factors impacting fingerprint value differences between source and sediment samples koiter et al 2018 this study found a disparity between sediment contributions among a coarse particle range i e 1000 μm and those from fine particle ranges even though the proportion of 63 1000 μm particles accounted for only 11 8 15 1 table 2 this finding is consistent with results from previous studies that reported a high risk in contribution error from coarse particles in a wide range haddadchi et al 2015 batista et al 2019 thus correcting for particle sorting and organic matter content may be useful to improve the precision of contribution apportionment collins et al 2010 however the sediment contribution based on 1000 μm particles was primarily from gully slope 79 0 in all check dams when corrected for particle sorting ssa organic matter content soc or a combination of both ssa and soc except for check dam no 2 when corrected for organic matter content for check dam no 2 with soc correction the mean sediment contribution from the gully slope only accounted for 41 8 while hillslope and sediment from check dam no 1 contributed 33 9 and 24 3 respectively fig 5 this indicated that in one aspect particle sorting correction occurred prior to organic matter correction in sediment contribution estimation as found in studies conducted in both watersheds and river basins smith and blake 2014 this was also the case for this study even though the particle fraction mean grain size and sorting between source and sediment samples exhibited no significant differences p 0 05 for all three check dams in different grain size ranges i e 10 63 and 1000 μm while soc exhibited significant differences p 0 05 between sources and sediment of each check dam in the particle size range of 1000 μm table 2 on the other hand significant p 0 05 differences were observed in sediment contributions based on coarse and fine particle size ranges even though ssa and soc corrections were applied to the 1000 μm particle size range this indicated that particle and organic corrections had limited effects on contribution bias calibration thus the correction or normalization of fingerprint values before the selection of optimal fingerprints may be a solution in reducing contribution estimation biases when using coarse particles koiter et al 2018 pye and blott 2004 vale et al 2016 4 2 effects of particle size and organic matter content on sediment source apportionment according to fingerprint value correction eqs 7 through 9 were used to correct for grain size and organic matter content impacts on fingerprint values prior to selecting optimal fingerprints based on corrected fingerprint values optimal fingerprints selected in the 1000 μm particle size range cumulatively correctly classified the sediment sources in 82 1 94 9 most of which were lower than the correction factors i e ssa and soc adopted in the model additionally no optimal fingerprints were found for check dams no 1 and no 2 when factors in source samples were corrected using soc or both soc and ssa as well as for check dam no 1 when factors in source samples were corrected using ssa table 3 compared to the sediment contribution estimated using the same correction factors in the model the sediment contribution estimated based on corrected optimal fingerprint groups indicated that sediment from the gully slope decreased by 24 1 82 3 while that from hillslope and upstream deposited sediment increased by 11 0 68 8 and 10 6 23 0 respectively fig 6 clearly fingerprint correction for a particle size range 1000 μm benefited the sediment contribution estimation however considerable differences remained between sediment contributions based on fine and coarse particles these results indicated that the best approach is to apply representative particle size ranges i e primary particle fraction rather than adopting correction factors and this is also the case for both fingerprints and models this is the reason why particle sorting or organic matter content correction should be used with caution as reported by previous studies koiter et al 2015 sherriff et al 2015 furthermore fractionating soil to a similar size to that of sediment or separately identifying different grain size sediment based on fingerprints from different grain size ranges are effective approaches as indicated by previous studies gholami et al 2019 haddadchi et al 2015 koiter et al 2018 4 3 uncertainty and feasibility of the optimal fingerprinting approach for sediment source discrimination in a series of connected check dams virtual sediment mixture samples were created using known sediment contributions as shown in fig 4 based on five randomly selected source samples for each level of check dam the rmse varied from 0 04 to 12 7 0 1 to 7 2 and 0 8 to 3 7 for the three levels of check dams when we adopted the optimal fingerprint groups shown in table 1 from 10 63 and 1000 μm particle fractions respectively it increased from 0 04 to 0 8 in check dam no 1 to 2 2 12 7 in check dam no 3 when different particle size ranges were used this indicated that the optimal fingerprint groups and model used in this study were reliable and feasible furthermore variation in sediment contribution based on fine and coarse particles and correlated variation of rmse indicated high accuracy of sediment contribution for virtual sediment mixtures but not directly means high precision identification of sediment source this is because virtual sediment mixtures are artificially created sediment samples that are not affected by particle sorting gaspar et al 2019 2022 it is a good approach to testify the reasonableness of optimal fingerprints and the sensitivity of the estimation model batista et al 2022 palazón et al 2015 accordingly the contribution uncertainty of the sediment source was attributed to two aspects in this study firstly the selection of particle size ranges has a significant impact on sediment source contribution estimation this was proven by the significant sediment contributions from different source areas for each level of check dam based on fine and coarse particles considering the limited effects of particle and organic corrections a wise choice is to screen the optimal fingerprint groups from reasonable particle size ranges fine particles with narrow ranges might normally provide a high possibility of obtaining robust contribution results as suggested in most studies collins et al 2020 haddadchi et al 2015 however coarse particles should be considered when transported sediment is dominated by coarse particles malhotra et al 2020 thus it seems that using the primary eroded particles is a reasonable choice secondly particle sorting from different sources of each level of check dam affected the fingerprint values to varying degrees as examples shown in fig 3 in a series of connected check dams in this study particle sorting was limited according to the variation in particle parameters listed in table 2 however enrichment for most of the fingerprints such as ca mg v w y and u in fig 3 and depletion for some of them such as na and ba in fig 3 were obvious this indicated that limited particle sorting also had a considerable impact on the value change of fingerprints from source soil to sediment it also varied from one level of check dam to another on the condition that check dams changed the landform and erosion deposition process of particles this also explained why sediment in check dams could be classified as a potential source and the variation in optimal composite fingerprints among different check dams within the same particle range even though there are uncertainties sediment contributions indicated the feasibility of the composite fingerprinting approach in sediment source identification for a series of connected check dams with no flood discharge facilities such as spillways the absence of flood discharge facilities decreased the deposition effect of coarse particles and the discharge effect of fine particles this further decreased the particle sorting of sediment deposited in check dams and simultaneously decreased the uncertainty associated with complex sorting ran et al 2006 vaezi et al 2017 the selection of the primary particle fractions transported during erosion processes is considerably more important than the correction of particle size or organic matter content either in fingerprint values or estimation models laceby et al 2017 haddadchi et al 2016 even though particles with grain size range of 63 1000 μm accounted for only 11 8 17 8 in all soil and sediment samples table 3 there were still significant differences in sediment contributions estimated based on fine particles and coarse particles with a relatively wide range this indicated that the primary particle fraction with a relatively narrow range is important to decrease uncertainty in sediment source identification even though the fraction of coarse particles was relatively low collins et al 2017 5 conclusions this study estimated sediment sources trapped behind a series of connected stone check dams based on optimal fingerprints selected from particle size ranges 10 63 and 1000 μm sediment sources based on optimal fingerprints selected from particle size ranges 10 and 63 μm showed that sediment was primarily from the hillslope area in check dams no 1 and no 2 66 7 and from adjacent upstream check dam i e no 2 for check dam no 3 60 5 however the sediment contribution in each individual check dam estimated based on a particle size range 1000 μm was inconsistent with that based on fine particle size ranges regardless of the check dams in sequence additionally correction of particle size and organic matter content provided barely any benefit for sediment contribution calibration in either fingerprint values or estimation models when selecting optimal fingerprints from a particle size range 1000 μm this indicated that sediment source discrimination based on the composite fingerprinting approach is feasible for a series of connected check dams whose particle sorting effects are relatively weak compared to those equipped with flood discharge facilities it is important to adopt the primary particle fraction with a relatively narrow range to obtain a robust sediment contribution additionally further studies are necessary to explore the reliability of the composite fingerprinting approach in sediment source tracing for series of connected check dams with strong coarse sediment deposition and fine sediment discharge effects attributed

2271,the composite fingerprinting approach is valuable in sediment source identification at different temporal and spatial scales however few studies have estimated watershed sediment source connections and transport impacted by multiple check dams this is due to the complexity of particle sorting under flood discharge practices here we attempt to identify sediment sources with three connected check dams in an agricultural mollisol catchment in northeast china based on optimal fingerprints screened from different size fractions i e 10 63 and 1000 μm the results showed consistent sediment contributions based on fine particle size ranges i e 10 and 63 μm but an inconsistent contribution based on a coarse particle size range i e 1000 μm regardless of the particle size or the organic corrections applied sediment deposited in check dams no 1 and no 2 was mainly from hillslopes cropland 66 7 while sediment in check dam no 3 was from its adjacent upstream check dam i e no 2 60 5 based on optimal fingerprints screened from 10 and 63 μm particle size ranges however when fingerprints were screened from a coarse particle size 1000 μm sediment in all three check dams was mainly from gully slopes 79 0 regardless of the specific surface area ssa of particles or the soil organic carbon soc correction factors used in the model except for soc correction for check dam no 2 conversely sediment was mainly derived from hillslopes when fingerprint values were corrected using ssa and soc except that no optimal fingerprints were selected this indicated the feasibility of sediment source discrimination based on the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source identification in catchments with a series of connected check dams under the condition that particle fractions impacted by check dams are relatively weak however optimal fingerprints screened from a relatively wide range of coarse particles caused divergent results regardless of the particle size or the organic correction factors used in model estimation or in fingerprint values further studies are necessary to explore the reliability of the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source tracing under a series of connected check dams where coarse sediment is selectively deposited and fine sediment is massively discharged under flood discharge practices keywords composite fingerprinting approach particle fraction virtual sediment mixture particle correction organic matter correction data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction sediment source identification as one of the significant aspects in soil erosion research is critical for tracing sediment sources nutrients and contaminants it is also important to identify associated influencing factors reveal variations in erosion rates and patterns and assess the influence of anthropogenic activities on environmental health thus it is valuable for the improvement of soil water conservation measures and environmental management collins et al 2017 tang et al 2019 sediment being a product of soil erosion can be used to identify soil characteristics in source areas this provides a basic foundation for tracing sediment sources alongside transported nutrients and contaminants using the composite fingerprinting approach sediment sources from small watersheds to large river systems or those from intra erosional events over several centuries can be determined using the composite fingerprinting approach through source classification optimal fingerprints screening and contribution estimation hughes et al 2009 nosrati et al 2021 walling and woodward 1995 to obtain robust sediment source results fingerprints should be detectable and behave conservatively during transport which include different types of natural and artificially derived organic and inorganic properties collins et al 2020 martínez carreras et al 2010 owens et al 2016 however sediment particle sorting and associated value variations in fingerprints are key aspects that influence the reliability and accuracy of sediment source identification laceby et al 2017 this is because source area soil is less impacted by sorting while sediment is a selectively transported product of runoff flow rates and wind whose sorting features are also affected by factors such as landform vegetation and land use types peng et al 2014 zhang et al 2007 this causes differences in particle fractions and soil properties that could be used as fingerprints to distinguish between source soil and sediment additionally types of soil properties may be either enriched or depleted within different particle fractions leading to sediment source estimation bias li and pang 2014 tang et al 2014 thus previous studies have proposed the following recommendations 1 screening optimal fingerprints from finer particles within a relatively narrow range i e 10 and 63 μm and 2 adopting particle and organic correction factors in contribution estimation models buyang et al 2019 haddadchi et al 2016 koiter et al 2018 fine particles are normally chosen this is because a considerable amount of nutrients geochemical elements radionuclides and contaminants are transported alongside fine particle fractions 63 μm koiter et al 2018 laceby et al 2017 fingerprints obtained from finer particles have also been shown to cause less bias compared to coarse particles in sediment source identification at both fluvial system and watershed scales batista et al 2019 sherriff et al 2015 for fluvial systems suspended sediment is typically composed of hydraulically derived well filtered fine particles almost all being 125 μm and dominated by a particle size range 63 μm belmont et al 2014 phillips and walling 1999 this has provided a baseline for identifying suspended sediment in rivers based on particle sizes 63 μm thus differences in grain size and associated fingerprints between source soil and sediment are typically larger compared to suspended sediment in fluvial systems allen et al 2017 jia et al 2016 however sediment particles deposited on riverbeds or trapped by check dams reservoirs ponds and low lying areas are typically relatively coarse particles with a wide range of grain sizes this causes sediment source identification to be subject to relatively significant uncertainty to decrease the uncertainty caused by particle sorting sediment source studies using the composite fingerprinting approach at the watershed scale have almost all focused on check dams or reservoirs furthermost upstream huang et al 2019 nosrati and collins 2021 zhang et al 2020 in other words few sediment source studies have focused on a series of constructed check dams or reservoirs in watersheds or those located further downstream in gullies check dams are typically constructed in series to trap eroded sediment raise the erosional base level control water flow decrease flow energy and restore degraded land the functions and effects of these series of check dams perform far better than those of a single check dam abbasi et al 2019 stavi et al 2020 wang et al 2021 previous studies have analyzed the impacts of these series constructed check dams on sediment sources erosion and hydraulic processes using methods that include field investigations model simulations and topographic measurements alfonso torreno et al 2019 dicenzo and luk 1997 wei et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 however few studies have explored sediment sources trapped behind a series of check dams this is because the redistribution of sediment trapped behind a series of check dams causes complex or even unpredictable changes in particle fractions additionally the unpredictable changes in particle fractions will lead to different variations in soil properties moreover when no flood discharge facilities have been constructed to check dams all eroded soil will be trapped behind them in such cases sediment source identification is typically based on whether flood couplets had any observable coarse fine deposition changes chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 however for check dams equipped with flood discharge facilities flood discharge will exhibit obvious course sediment deposition and fine sediment discharge effects vaezi et al 2017 flood discharge not only enhances particle sorting effects but also increases the impact that upstream check dams have on downstream check dams in this case it is difficult to identify the sediment deposited trapped behind these check dams the chinese mollisol region is one of the country s most important crop production zones severe soil loss in this agricultural dominated zone is attributed to the additive effects of multiple erosion agents long sloping landforms sticky soils concentrated rainstorms and intense anthropogenic activities cui et al 2007 xu et al 2010 sheet and rill hillslope erosion and overland flow concentrations have promoted the development of gullies these gullies not only damage cropland but also obstruct cultivation machinery thus gully erosion is treated as a destructive and dramatic form of land degradation in northeast china shen et al 2018 wen et al 2021 for decades various types of measures have been used to control gully erosion such as constructing a series of check dams in gully channels and to prevent sloping erosion to reduce erosion intensity in agricultural catchments within this zone liu et al 2019 shen et al 2020 therefore sediment source identification in these agricultural catchments is critical in the establishment of soil conservation measures to effectively control severe soil erosion previous studies have discriminated sediment sources from gullies and hillslopes in watersheds using sediment collected from gully beds or deposited in reservoirs in the mollisol region of northeast china chen et al 2021 fang 2015 huang et al 2019 2022 however few of these studies have focused on a series of check dams which has adversely affected our understanding of how a series of check dams can effectuate sediment control it has also restrained our understanding of how to improve the arrangement of check dams accordingly this study selected an agricultural catchment with a series of stone check dams to identify sediment sources deposited in each check dam affected by landforms i e hillslope and gully slope the specific objectives were to assess the feasibility of the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source studies under a series of check dams to clarify the impact that particle size has on sediment source identification and to analyze the effect of particle and organic corrections in the contribution estimation model or in fingerprint values on sediment source contributions the results from this study will help us better understand the effectiveness of a series of check dams on sediment transport in the chinese mollisol region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xinmin catchment 12 54 7 06 e 48 4 16 42 n is a typical agricultural catchment located in keshan county heilongjiang province china typical rolling hills characterize the landform of the catchment and its average elevation ranges from 160 m to 220 m amsl from east to west according to records from the keshan meteorological station 1951 2019 the average annual temperature is approx 2 c with a maximum average of 21 c in july and a minimum average of 22 c in january local weather is subject to obvious annual and interannual changes with a prolonged cold season the annual precipitation averages 510 7 mm most of which approx 82 falls between june and september the soil type of the catchment is mollisol according to the keys to soil taxonomy usda nrcs which corresponds to chernozem according to world soil resources reports from the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations un fao 2015 soil survey staff 2014 the bulk density averaged 1 20 g cm 3 in the tillage layer the main local crops planted are rotational maize zea mays and soybean glycine max l merr applying contour farming practices both crops are sown in late april to early may on ridges the area of this agricultural catchment is 1 75 km2 dominated by sloping cropland ranging from approx 1 to 7 artificial forest dominated by populus alba populus alba p berolinensis was planted on relatively gentle gully slopes approx 22 in 2006 at the same time as the stone check dams were constructed while steep gully slopes approx 22 37 were left bare for this study the sampling area above the check dams was 0 15 km2 in a small catchment with an area of 0 25 km2 three levels of check dams were selected at the uppermost upstream area of the gully to identify sediment sources affected by a series of check dams they were check dams no 1 no 2 and no 3 in an upstream to downstream direction the dam heights are 1 2 1 2 and 1 4 m for check dams no 1 to no 3 the widths are 6 5 7 4 and 13 0 m and the distances to the gully head are approx 77 100 and 140 m respectively none of the individual check dams in this series were equipped with flood discharge facilities flow and sediment are transported in an upstream to downstream direction through rectangularly shaped hollowed out areas 0 3 m height fig 1 this decreases coarse sediment deposits and fine sediment discharge compared to that occurring in check dams with flood discharge facilities satisfying a key condition of this study li et al 2010 an unpaved agricultural road goes almost parallel to the gully however sediment and runoff were scarcely transported into the gully in all areas except for the bottom of the gully i e the low lying area of the catchment this is because soil compaction by farm machinery ephemeral gully erosion of the road and vegetation protection to the gully edge resulted in the road being slightly lower than adjacent cropland and 15 20 cm lower than the gully edge thus sediment from the unpaved road was not a potential source for sediment deposited in the three levels of check dams 2 2 soil sampling and analysis this study selected the three uppermost upstream check dams to analyze sediment sources trapped behind each dam source samples were randomly collected separately at the upstream area of each stone check dam surface soil 0 5 cm was collected considering the variation in landform and land use types as well as the relatively spatially uniform distribution of the sampling sites source samples were collected at a depth of 5 cm this was due to the relatively severe erosion attributed to multiple erosion agents and the intensive cultivation that takes place in the chinese mollisol region zhang et al 2022a within the dam field a pit was dug 2 m from each of the three check dams at a 50 cm depth depth incremental soil samples were collected at a depth of 5 cm because no visible coarse fine flood formed sedimentary layer was identifiable in total 11 9 and 16 samples were collected from hillslopes i e cropland at the upstream area of all three check dams while 14 10 and 13 samples were collected from the gully slope respectively according to overland flow discharge rates in july 2019 fig 1 in total 73 source samples and 30 sediment samples were collected all source and sediment samples were ultrasonically dispersed after being air dried ground and passed through 2 mm screens to remove litter and root material following this different particle fractions i e 10 63 and 1000 μm were classified considering variation in particle fractions of mollisol at source areas and deposited sediment the main particle fractions should be included in sediment source identification haddadchi et al 2016 malhotra et al 2020 particles were classified into different ranges using wet sieving and centrifugation techniques after soil aggregates were dispersed via the ultrasonic method wet sieving was conducted to obtain 63 μm and 1000 μm particle size ranges after which centrifugation was used to separate particles into a 10 μm particle size range the centrifugal rotational speed duration and soil suspension concentration were selected through preliminary experiments based on stokes law potential fingerprinting tracer values were tested in all source soil and sediment samples that were separated into these different grain size ranges soil organic carbon soc g kg content was determined using the potassium dichromate external heating method tang et al 2012 zhang et al 2022a geochemical elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms to dissolve most minerals in the samples each sample was digested by multiple acid hno3 hclo4 hf fuming dried and dissolved in hcl there were 45 geochemical elements

using a mastersizer 2000 instrument malvern instruments malvern uk after soil organic matter and calcium carbonate were removed using a chemical method h2o2 and hcl for a particle size range of 1000 μm 2 3 selection of optimal fingerprint groups the wet sieving and centrifugation results showed that 10 μm particles accounted for 48 7 5 8 and 49 3 5 7 respectively in source soil and sediment samples 10 63 μm particles accounted for 36 5 4 3 and 37 0 4 9 respectively while 63 1000 μm particles accounted for 14 8 this indicated that both 10 and 10 63 μm particles are the main fraction in sediment transport thus this study determined the sediment source using 10 and 63 μm particles taking the bulk sample i e 1000 μm as a comparison therefore this study screened for optimal fingerprint groups within grain size ranges of 10 63 and 1000 μm based on the composite fingerprinting approach before conducting sediment contribution estimations the screening procedure for optimal fingerprint groups involved four main steps the first step was classifying source groups based on factors that were mainly responsible for the variation in soil properties this priori source grouping results were cross checked with information obtained from field investigations including landforms local cultivation and management patterns and erosion types evrard et al 2022 the results of source grouping are also reclassified using cluster analysis pulley et al 2017 the second step was to identify potential fingerprints using the kruskal wallis h test the third step was to confirm the conservative behavior of the fingerprints that passed the kruskal wallis h test using a range test and a variability ratio analysis i e intergroup to intragroup variability laceby et al 2017 owens et al 2016 the fourth step was to assess the discriminatory power of tracers using discriminant function analysis dfa based on wilks s lambda distribution wilk s λ it was also necessary to produce biplots based on principal component analysis pca to ensure the distribution consistency of the final selected tracers between sediment and source samples which ultimately confirmed the optimal fingerprint groups fig s1 gellis and walling 2013 koiter et al 2013 this study classified potential sediment sources into hillslope i e cropland and gully slope given that sediment from hillsope and gully was the main sediment sources in the chinese mollisol region fang 2015 zhang et al 2022b moreover previous studies successfully identified these two sources using geochemical elements huang et al 2019 2020 this study carefully selected source classification schemes to identify sediment contributions from hillslope and gully slope behind each check dam and to understand sediment source connection and transport impacted by multiple check dams this is because sediment source classification significantly impacts the accuracy of source determination pulley et al 2017 vercruysse and grabowski 2018 this study determined a more appropriate scheme by comparing two source classification schemes the first scheme classified sediment sources into hillslope and gully slope for each check dam schme 1 in other words hillslope and gully slope samples for check dam no 1 were collected from s1 and g1 partitions samples for check dam no 2 were collected from s1 s2 and g1 g2 partitions and hillslope and gully slope samples were collected from g1 g2 g3 and s1 s2 s3 partitions for check dam no 3 the subareas on the hillslope i e s1 s2 s3 were roughly divided based on runoff path while the subareas of the gully slope i e g1 g2 g3 were distinctly separated by the location of check dams the hillslope could be roughly divided into three subareas for three levels of check dams this is because hillslopes are croplands adopting the same tillage and management practices which did not lead to significant variation in fingerprinting properties attributed to human activities this source classification scheme ignored the effects of upstream check dams i e check dams no 1 and no 2 on downstream check dams i e check dams no 2 and no 3 this allowed the eroded soil to be directly transported into check dams no 2 and no 3 which is not consistent with real world conditions the second scheme classified sediment sources for check dam no 1 into hillslope s1 and gully slope g1 as well while classified sediment sources into hillslope gully slope and upstream check dam sediment for check dams no 2 and no 3 thus sediment sources for check dam no 2 were hillslope s2 gully slope g2 and sediment from check dam no 1 while they were hillslope s3 gully slope g3 and sediment from check dam no 2 in check dam no 3 schme 2 fig 2 in this classification scheme deposited sediment in upstream check dams no 1 and no 2 was a source for adjacent downstream check dams no 2 and no 3 although this corresponds to real world conditions this scheme may cause confusion during source discrimination this is because deposited sediment in the check dams is a mixture from hillslope and gully slope areas 2 4 sediment source contribution estimation based on the optimal fingerprint groups in each grain size range we estimated the contribution of potential sources to sediment deposits using a multivariate mixing model which minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals r es for the tracers involved gellis and walling 2013 particle and organic correction factors were adopted in the estimation model when the optimal fingerprint groups were selected from a coarse particle i e 1000 μm to reduce estimation bias this study adopted specific surface area ssa as the particle correction factor and adopted organic carbon content soc as the organic correction factor this is because both ssa and soc had relatively high correlations with the chemical reactivity of elements and proved to be effective factors in sediment contribution correction laceby et al 2017 gaspar et al 2022 the multivariate mixing models are expressed as follows for particle size ranges of 10 63 and 1000 μm 1 r es f 1 n c f s 1 m p s s sf c f 2 for a particle size range of 1000 μm 2 r es f 1 n c f s

the number of potential sediment sources cf is the concentration or value of factor f in the sediment ps is the proportional contribution of sediment from potential source s ssf is the average value of factor f in potential source s when all detectable parameters obey a normal distribution according to quantile quantile q q plots using spss 19 0 and zs is a particle correction factor i e the ratio of the specific sediment surface area to that of the source material the ssa for a particle fraction 1000 μm was obtained to assess the effect of particle sorting on sediment source discrimination os is an organic matter content correction factor i e the soc ratio of sediment to that of the source soil particle and organic matter content corrections were not applied for particle fractions 10 and 63 μm this was due to the high risk of overcorrection during particle correction of fingerprints for fine particles which could cause increased concentration differences between sediment and source samples koiter et al 2018 this model was used under constraints namely that the contribution of each source must be nonnegative and the total contribution must sum to 1 collins et al 1997 this study used a genetic algorithm in combination with monte carlo simulation analysis to obtain sediment source contributions collins et al 2012 haddadchi et al 2013 5000 monte carlo iterations were applied as a surrogate for conventional random sampling in combination with genetic algorithm optimization to obtain accurate contributions moreover contribution uncertainties attributed to fingerprints and mixing model optimization were estimated by incorporating monte carlo analysis into the optimization routines of the mixing model sample means and the relative standard deviation sd of tracers for each potential source within all selected grain size ranges were estimated using a bootstrap procedure this was conducted to infer the statistical distribution of tracers on the basis that analytical errors and the variability of tracers based on the sampling regime of each source area can be used to represent the overall source we also used t test to analyze the uncertainty of sediment source contributions walling 2013 source apportionment modeling outputs were tested using goodness of fit gof based on the mean absolute error manjoro et al 2017 the accuracy of the unmixing model predictions was assessed using virtual sediment mixtures vsms gaspar et al 2022 gholami et al 2020 the results between the known source proportion and model estimation were compared using root mean square error rmse gof and rmse were calculated as follows 5 gof 1 n 1 f 1 n c f s 1 m p s s f s c f 2 6 rmse 1 m f 1 m p known p predicted 2 where pknown is the known percentage source contribution in the vsms and ppredicted is the percentage source contribution predicted eq 5 must also satisfy constraints namely that the contribution of each source must be nonnegative and the total contribution must sum to 1 palazón et al 2015 sediment source estimation results obtained by the mixing model were considered acceptable when the gof value was 80 mckinley et al 2013 additionally to clarify the impact of fingerprints from the coarse particle fraction i e 1000 μm on sediment source identification we compared sediment source contribution differences based on different correction methods the contributions included results from a multivariate mixing model with i e eqs 2 4 and with no i e eq 1 particle and organic corrections and results from corrected particle and organic matter in fingerprint values eqs 7 9 combined with eq 1 the particle size correction factor cssa corr the organic matter correction factor csoc corr and the combined correction to particle size and organic matter cssa soc corr of fingerprint values were calculated as follows koiter et al 2018 7 c s s a corr c f z s 8 c s o c corr c f o s 9 c ssa s o c corr c f z s o s 3 results 3 1 changes in optimal fingerprint values within different grain size ranges optimal fingerprint groups within different grain size ranges for each of the three check dams were screened according to the aforementioned procedures the results showed that the cumulative correct source discrimination based on classification schme 1 was relatively low compared to schme 2 specifically optimal fingerprint groups based on schme 1 provided a cumulative correct source discrimination of 74 4 when particle sizes were 63 μm and 1000 μm while ranging from 84 7 to 95 3 when the particle size range was 10 μm however for all particle sizes the cumulative correct source discrimination ranged from 89 3 to 100 based on optimal fingerprint groups selected using schme 2 table 1 thus schme 2 was used in this study there was a decreasing trend in cumulative correct source discrimination as the particle size increased which was also the trend for check dams in an upstream to downstream direction i e no 1 through no 3 cumulative correct source discrimination decreased from 100 to 89 3 with an increase in particle size and gradually decreased from 100 to 92 3 in an upstream to downstream direction i e no 1 through no 3 in total 20 elements were included in the optimal fingerprint groups of the three check dams screened from three particle size ranges i e 10 63 and 1000 μm nine of these elements ba ca mg mn na u v w and y were detected in different fingerprint groups table 1 these nine elements were consequently used as examples to analyze the distribution characteristics of elements affected by particle size these nine elements were classified into three groups based on their variations in different particle size ranges the results showed that ca mg v w and y were enriched in particle size ranges of 10 and 63 μm compared to that of 1000 μm in both source hillslope and gully slope and sediment samples for all three check dams however certain elements i e v w and y in samples collected from the hillslope area of check dam no 3 were depleted in the 63 μm particle range fig 3 a e although na was depleted in the 10 μm particle range it was enriched in the 63 μm particle range fig 3 f compared to that of the 1000 μm particle range in both source and sediment samples in all three check dams the remaining elements ba mn and u were primarily enriched in the 10 μm particle range fig 3 g i this indicated that the characteristic distribution trend of representative fingerprints was similar among source and sediment samples 3 2 sediment source apportionment in all three check dams based on different particle size ranges based on different grain size ranges sediment contributions varied among the three check dams optimal fingerprints selected from fine particles i e 10 and 63 μm showed that sediment behind check dams no 1 and no 2 was primarily from the hillslope cropland area while it was dominated by sediment deposited in its adjacent upstream check dam i e no 2 for check dam no 3 cropland contributed 66 7 of the sediment in check dams no 1 and no 2 while it only accounted for between 29 6 and 39 2 in check dam no 3 respectively based on fingerprints from 10 and 63 μm particle ranges from an upstream to downstream direction check dam no 1 contributed between 27 4 and 70 1 of sediment to adjacent downstream check dams i e no 2 and no 3 however optimal fingerprints selected from 1000 μm particle range indicated that sediment in all three check dams was primarily from the gully slope area 88 7 while barely any sediment was transported in the check dam constructed gully in an upstream to downstream direction i e from check dam no 1 to check dams no 2 and no 3 fig 4 this is contrary to common sense given that water carries sediment as it flows through gully systems thus variations in sediment contributions based on optimal fingerprints from the different grain size ranges showed that source contributions obtained using particle fractions 10 and 63 μm were consistent while they were opposite to those estimated based on a particle range 1000 μm these predicted source contributions adopting the mixing model algorithm approach were acceptable this is because from check dam no 1 to no 3 the gof for sediment source estimation decreased from 95 9 to 89 2 on the condition of the particle range 1000 μm while it decreased from 97 1 to 91 1 on the condition of particle ranges 10 and 63 μm the sediment source differences based on fine and coarse particles implied a high estimation bias potential of sediment contribution using optimal fingerprints from a coarse particle fraction without correcting for particle sorting or organic matter content 4 discussion 4 1 effects of particle size and organic matter content on sediment source apportionment according to model correction particle size and organic matter content are two key factors impacting fingerprint value differences between source and sediment samples koiter et al 2018 this study found a disparity between sediment contributions among a coarse particle range i e 1000 μm and those from fine particle ranges even though the proportion of 63 1000 μm particles accounted for only 11 8 15 1 table 2 this finding is consistent with results from previous studies that reported a high risk in contribution error from coarse particles in a wide range haddadchi et al 2015 batista et al 2019 thus correcting for particle sorting and organic matter content may be useful to improve the precision of contribution apportionment collins et al 2010 however the sediment contribution based on 1000 μm particles was primarily from gully slope 79 0 in all check dams when corrected for particle sorting ssa organic matter content soc or a combination of both ssa and soc except for check dam no 2 when corrected for organic matter content for check dam no 2 with soc correction the mean sediment contribution from the gully slope only accounted for 41 8 while hillslope and sediment from check dam no 1 contributed 33 9 and 24 3 respectively fig 5 this indicated that in one aspect particle sorting correction occurred prior to organic matter correction in sediment contribution estimation as found in studies conducted in both watersheds and river basins smith and blake 2014 this was also the case for this study even though the particle fraction mean grain size and sorting between source and sediment samples exhibited no significant differences p 0 05 for all three check dams in different grain size ranges i e 10 63 and 1000 μm while soc exhibited significant differences p 0 05 between sources and sediment of each check dam in the particle size range of 1000 μm table 2 on the other hand significant p 0 05 differences were observed in sediment contributions based on coarse and fine particle size ranges even though ssa and soc corrections were applied to the 1000 μm particle size range this indicated that particle and organic corrections had limited effects on contribution bias calibration thus the correction or normalization of fingerprint values before the selection of optimal fingerprints may be a solution in reducing contribution estimation biases when using coarse particles koiter et al 2018 pye and blott 2004 vale et al 2016 4 2 effects of particle size and organic matter content on sediment source apportionment according to fingerprint value correction eqs 7 through 9 were used to correct for grain size and organic matter content impacts on fingerprint values prior to selecting optimal fingerprints based on corrected fingerprint values optimal fingerprints selected in the 1000 μm particle size range cumulatively correctly classified the sediment sources in 82 1 94 9 most of which were lower than the correction factors i e ssa and soc adopted in the model additionally no optimal fingerprints were found for check dams no 1 and no 2 when factors in source samples were corrected using soc or both soc and ssa as well as for check dam no 1 when factors in source samples were corrected using ssa table 3 compared to the sediment contribution estimated using the same correction factors in the model the sediment contribution estimated based on corrected optimal fingerprint groups indicated that sediment from the gully slope decreased by 24 1 82 3 while that from hillslope and upstream deposited sediment increased by 11 0 68 8 and 10 6 23 0 respectively fig 6 clearly fingerprint correction for a particle size range 1000 μm benefited the sediment contribution estimation however considerable differences remained between sediment contributions based on fine and coarse particles these results indicated that the best approach is to apply representative particle size ranges i e primary particle fraction rather than adopting correction factors and this is also the case for both fingerprints and models this is the reason why particle sorting or organic matter content correction should be used with caution as reported by previous studies koiter et al 2015 sherriff et al 2015 furthermore fractionating soil to a similar size to that of sediment or separately identifying different grain size sediment based on fingerprints from different grain size ranges are effective approaches as indicated by previous studies gholami et al 2019 haddadchi et al 2015 koiter et al 2018 4 3 uncertainty and feasibility of the optimal fingerprinting approach for sediment source discrimination in a series of connected check dams virtual sediment mixture samples were created using known sediment contributions as shown in fig 4 based on five randomly selected source samples for each level of check dam the rmse varied from 0 04 to 12 7 0 1 to 7 2 and 0 8 to 3 7 for the three levels of check dams when we adopted the optimal fingerprint groups shown in table 1 from 10 63 and 1000 μm particle fractions respectively it increased from 0 04 to 0 8 in check dam no 1 to 2 2 12 7 in check dam no 3 when different particle size ranges were used this indicated that the optimal fingerprint groups and model used in this study were reliable and feasible furthermore variation in sediment contribution based on fine and coarse particles and correlated variation of rmse indicated high accuracy of sediment contribution for virtual sediment mixtures but not directly means high precision identification of sediment source this is because virtual sediment mixtures are artificially created sediment samples that are not affected by particle sorting gaspar et al 2019 2022 it is a good approach to testify the reasonableness of optimal fingerprints and the sensitivity of the estimation model batista et al 2022 palazón et al 2015 accordingly the contribution uncertainty of the sediment source was attributed to two aspects in this study firstly the selection of particle size ranges has a significant impact on sediment source contribution estimation this was proven by the significant sediment contributions from different source areas for each level of check dam based on fine and coarse particles considering the limited effects of particle and organic corrections a wise choice is to screen the optimal fingerprint groups from reasonable particle size ranges fine particles with narrow ranges might normally provide a high possibility of obtaining robust contribution results as suggested in most studies collins et al 2020 haddadchi et al 2015 however coarse particles should be considered when transported sediment is dominated by coarse particles malhotra et al 2020 thus it seems that using the primary eroded particles is a reasonable choice secondly particle sorting from different sources of each level of check dam affected the fingerprint values to varying degrees as examples shown in fig 3 in a series of connected check dams in this study particle sorting was limited according to the variation in particle parameters listed in table 2 however enrichment for most of the fingerprints such as ca mg v w y and u in fig 3 and depletion for some of them such as na and ba in fig 3 were obvious this indicated that limited particle sorting also had a considerable impact on the value change of fingerprints from source soil to sediment it also varied from one level of check dam to another on the condition that check dams changed the landform and erosion deposition process of particles this also explained why sediment in check dams could be classified as a potential source and the variation in optimal composite fingerprints among different check dams within the same particle range even though there are uncertainties sediment contributions indicated the feasibility of the composite fingerprinting approach in sediment source identification for a series of connected check dams with no flood discharge facilities such as spillways the absence of flood discharge facilities decreased the deposition effect of coarse particles and the discharge effect of fine particles this further decreased the particle sorting of sediment deposited in check dams and simultaneously decreased the uncertainty associated with complex sorting ran et al 2006 vaezi et al 2017 the selection of the primary particle fractions transported during erosion processes is considerably more important than the correction of particle size or organic matter content either in fingerprint values or estimation models laceby et al 2017 haddadchi et al 2016 even though particles with grain size range of 63 1000 μm accounted for only 11 8 17 8 in all soil and sediment samples table 3 there were still significant differences in sediment contributions estimated based on fine particles and coarse particles with a relatively wide range this indicated that the primary particle fraction with a relatively narrow range is important to decrease uncertainty in sediment source identification even though the fraction of coarse particles was relatively low collins et al 2017 5 conclusions this study estimated sediment sources trapped behind a series of connected stone check dams based on optimal fingerprints selected from particle size ranges 10 63 and 1000 μm sediment sources based on optimal fingerprints selected from particle size ranges 10 and 63 μm showed that sediment was primarily from the hillslope area in check dams no 1 and no 2 66 7 and from adjacent upstream check dam i e no 2 for check dam no 3 60 5 however the sediment contribution in each individual check dam estimated based on a particle size range 1000 μm was inconsistent with that based on fine particle size ranges regardless of the check dams in sequence additionally correction of particle size and organic matter content provided barely any benefit for sediment contribution calibration in either fingerprint values or estimation models when selecting optimal fingerprints from a particle size range 1000 μm this indicated that sediment source discrimination based on the composite fingerprinting approach is feasible for a series of connected check dams whose particle sorting effects are relatively weak compared to those equipped with flood discharge facilities it is important to adopt the primary particle fraction with a relatively narrow range to obtain a robust sediment contribution additionally further studies are necessary to explore the reliability of the composite fingerprinting approach in sediment source tracing for series of connected check dams with strong coarse sediment deposition and fine sediment discharge effects attributed

2272,reconstructions of the most severe historic flood events contribute to improved quantification of design discharges corresponding to large return periods reducing the uncertainty of design discharges has a great significance in constructing proper flood defences to protect the hinterland from future flooding however reconstructions of the peak discharges of such historic flood events are generally associated with large uncertainties which arise from the accuracy of the historic topography hydraulic roughness of the river channels and floodplains and the historic hydrograph shape this study sets up a one dimensional two dimensional 1d 2d coupled hydraulic model stretching from the upstream of bonn at remagen to downstream of düsseldorf germany with the length of 113 km to reconstruct the maximum discharge of the 1374 flood event qmax 1374 which is considered to be the largest flood of the last millennium in the lower rhine catchment an uncertainty analysis was performed by adopting different river bed levels and roughness values in order to estimate the influence of these uncertainties on the reconstructed peak discharge the upstream discharge wave was varied corresponding to a wide range of peak discharges from 12 000 to 24 000 m3 s the resulting qmax 1374 was determined of between 14 400 and 18 500 m3 s were then used in a flood frequency analysis to determine the design discharges corresponding to different return periods compared to the design discharge computed with previous estimations of the 1374 peak discharge we found a significant reduction of 2 000 m3 s in the design discharge corresponding to a 100 000 year return period which is the maximum safety standard adopted in the dutch water policy for some downstream dike sections

main natural hazards causing large damage and human casualties worldwide alfieri et al 2017 arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 even though flood risk is expected to increase due to climate and land use change alfieri et al 2015 brádzil et al 2006 hirabayashi et al 2013 flood events have been a threat since humans began occupying the floodplains of major rivers stanley et al 2001 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 nowadays for many rivers design discharges corresponding to a specific return period are used to construct flood defences to protect the hinterland from extreme flood events these design discharges are generally determined by using a flood frequency analysis in such an analysis the annual maximum discharges of a measured data set or peak values that exceed a certain threshold are selected which are then used to determine the parameters of a probability distribution function bezak et al 2014 gaume 2018 lang et al 1999 schendel and thongwichian 2017 from this fitted distribution function discharges corresponding to different return periods are derived in many countries e g the netherlands norway germany uk us the discharges corresponding to large return

robust flood frequency analysis cameron et al 1999 engeland et al 2018 gebregiorgis and hossain 2012 van alphen 2016 vorogushyn et al 2012 using the limited measured discharge data set to extrapolate to a design discharge corresponding to such large return periods results in large uncertainty intervals in addition to the lower bound of the uncertainty interval that is crucial for flood protection policymaking the upper bound is also important since an extreme overestimation of the design discharge caused by extrapolation may result in unnecessarily large investments to reduce these uncertainty intervals the data set of measured discharges can be extended with reconstructed historic flood events e g bomers et al 2019a frances et al 1994 macdonald et al 2014 sartor et al 2010 in other words improved quantification of design discharges corresponding to large return periods can be achieved by precise reconstruction of the most severe historic flood events therefore many studies have focused on reconstructing historic flood discharges based on various sources such as written records flood marks and flood deposits balasch et al 2010 benito et al 2021 bomers et al 2019b bomers et al 2019c elleder et al 2013 herget and meurs 2010 o connell et al 2002 payrastre et al 2011 reis and stedinger 2005 ruiz bellet et al 2014 stamataki and kjeldsen 2021 toonen et al 2013 toonen et al 2015 van der meulen et al 2021 discharge magnitudes of historic flood events can be reconstructed by using the cross sectional approach or longitudinal approach these two approaches are collectively referred to as simple approaches herget and meurs 2010 webb and jarrett 2002 or multidimensional hydraulic modelling approach 2d and 3d hydraulic models lang et al 2003 sheffer et al 2003 van der meulen et al 2021 van doornik 2013 however reconstructed peak discharges of historic flood events are generally associated with large uncertainties arising from inaccuracies in the historic topography hydraulic roughness of the main river and floodplains and historic hydrograph shape benito and thorndycraft 2003 herget and meurs 2010 lang et al 2003 lang et al 2004 simple approaches can only account for uncertainties in spatial components at selected cross section locations but not in the river system as a whole in addition these approaches can also only consider the effect of peak discharge on river water levels without the hydrograph shape while hydrograph shapes affect water levels and flooding parameters e g flood extent inundation depth duration bomers et al 2019d dung et al 2015 pol 2014 in contrast using a multidimensional hydraulic modelling approach allows for taking into account spatial uncertainties and discharge waves peak discharge and flood hydrograph shape on river water levels bomers et al 2019b lang et al 2003 lang et al 2004 hence this approach can simulate spatial components and river flow closer to reality than simple approaches many hydraulic models such as mike delft3d hec ras isis now flood modeller sobek lisflood fp have been developed over the last decades to address the complex real world hydraulic problems bomers et al 2019b horritt and bates 2002 pasquier et al 2018 van et al 2012 these hydraulic models calculate a rating curve q h by solving the saint venant equations also referred to as the shallow water equations representing the flow in natural rivers and floodplains 1d hydraulic models are commonly used to provide estimates of the flow depth and velocity at locations in the river system with a low computational cost however they are unsuitable for accurately simulating flood propagation especially the complex 2d flow in floodplains in contrast 2d depth averaged hydraulic models can better simulate complex flow patterns and provide more accurate results the main disadvantages of 2d hydraulic models are that they require more in depth data regarding topography and resistance data and have a large computational cost therefore using 2d hydraulic models is generally not deemed suitable for reconstructions of historic flood events especially when uncertainty analysis regarding the most uncertain parameters of the river and floodplains river bathymetry floodplain topography hydraulic roughness are also required necessitating several different simulations in recent years the coupling between 1d and 2d hydraulic models has become popular to combine advantages of both approaches adeogun et al 2015 bomers et al 2019b cardoso et al 2020 dasallas et al 2019 fan et al 2017 leandro and martins 2016 pasquier et al

the paper ends with conclusions in section 5 2 case study the rhine river is one of the major rivers in europe with a length of 1 230 km and an average discharge of about 2 200 m3 s at lobith in the lower rhine te linde et al 2011 it originates from the alps in switzerland and flows through germany and the netherlands and debouches into the north sea fig 1 a in this study we consider an area of 991 km2 of the rhine river catchment stretching from upstream of bonn to downstream of düsseldorf germany with the length of 113 km fig 1b the upstream boundary of the study area is placed 15 km upstream of the city of bonn at remagen just upstream where the rhine river enters the alluvial reaches of the lower rhine valley erkens et al 2011 klostermann 1992 van der meulen et al 2020 in addition the distance from the upper boundary at remagen to cologne and urdenbach are 32 5 and 81 km respectively 2 1 the 1374 flood event and related historic flood marks the first months of 1374 were characterized by a continuous flood event in several catchments throughout central europe numerous source texts are compiled in alexandre 1987 buismann 1996 weikinn 1958 evidence is handed down mainly by written reports from northern france including paris belgium the netherlands and towards bremen in northern germany for the northward margin of occurrence the river weser and vlatava valleys including prague mark the eastern limits and strasbourg in alsace towards ulm at danube river the southern one due to the long time and missing motivation of quantitative monitoring water level reports of the flood event are rather rare as a characteristic of central europe precipitation occurred by snow and rain with cold periods which resulted in increased discharges due to additional meltwater supply to intensive long lasting rainfall krahe 1997 generally speaking discharge of the northern parts of the rhine river was characterized by high water levels lasting from late december 1373 until april 1374 at cologne peak levels are reported from january 4th january 25th and february 9 11th 1374 the pattern of three peaks is confirmed for the lower rhine fig 1a section with minor delays for january 6th and 21st 25th and february 9 15th the flood event in february is assumed to have the highest water level ever observed at cologne in the past krahe 1997 besides the ice jam flood in 1784 brázdil et al 2010 based on the report of boats crossing the city fortification the minimum water level during peak discharge at cologne can be estimated as 47 70 m above sea level asl the maximum flood water level is estimated to be 48 50 m asl based on the report of the steps of st georgius monastery not being reached herget and meurs 2010 with the above arguments the authors suggest a representative value of 48 28 m asl for the flood peak level at cologne note that all elevation levels mentioned above were transferred to the modern period reference level of the current gauge at an elevation of 34 98 m asl at cologne the second location with water level information of the flood event from within the area of investigation is a flood level marker given at a house in urdenbach fig 2 located just upstream of the city of düsseldorf geodetic surveys result in an elevation of 41 69 m asl the marker is installed at a house located in the valley of itter creek a minor local tributary of the river rhine approximately 500 m upstream of the ancient confluence due to the gentle slope and short distance the water level of the creek is assumed equal to the rhine river during flood events as documented by the repeated flood marks on the building according to the owner of the house the inscription was found during renovation of the house and modified by appearance for better visibility the validity of the marker could not be verified so far but it should be noted that the house itself was built in approximately 1709 several centuries after the flood event unfortunately it is not known so far who made the first inscription of the flood level and what information the elevation is based on it might be speculated that during the inscription of the water level of the ice jam flood of january 1784 the previous top record of water level in 1374 was re marked 3 methodology to reconstruct the qmax 1374 we used an inverse modelling approach van der meulen et al 2021 first the 1d 2d coupled hydraulic model was set up with the past terrain river bathymetry and floodplains topography and hydraulic roughness coefficients for land cover classes corresponding to the medieval situation to simulate discharge waves with different peak discharges an uncertainty analysis was then performed to investigate the effects of the uncertain input parameters river bathymetry and floodplains topography and hydraulic roughness coefficients on the qmax 1374 subsequently the simulated water levels were compared with the flood marks observed water levels corresponding to the 1374 flood event at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach to determine the appropriate discharge magnitude at the upstream boundary the estimated qmax 1374 was used to extend the historical discharge data set a flood frequency analysis was then performed based on the extended discharge data set to determine the design discharges and their 95 confidence interval for different return periods 3 1 data 3 1 1 topography and bathymetry the past river bathymetry and floodplain topography play an important role in reconstructing historic flood events e g benito and thorndycraft 2004 herget and meurs 2010 lang et al 2004 however these data for the year 1374 are not available therefore a section of the palaeo dem with a 10 mresolution of the lower rhine valley and upper delta in early medieval times circa 800 ce fig 1 reconstructed by van der meulen et al 2020 was used for this study this palaeo dem was reconstructed based on a ground level lidar dem which was obtained by merging the available lidar data ahn2 in the netherlands national grid and dgm1 resampled from the german to the netherlands grid and inserting the river bathymetry from the rws lanuv baseline datasets the lidar dem was corrected for elevation change due to the recent mining induced subsidence harnischmacher and zepp 2014 existing geological mapping datasets were then used to demarcate inactive and active zones in the dem see van der meulen et al 2020 for more details all anthropogenic relief elements were removed using separate procedures for linear e g roads railroads dikes and non linear e g pits raised grounds for buildings dump sites elements to obtain the palaeotopography of the inactive zone then geological and historical geographical information were incorporated to reconstruct the natural floodplain topography and the river position and bathymetry in the active zone for the target age of palaeo dem van der meulen et al 2020 in this study it was assumed that there were no significant interventions in the floodplains between the 800 ce and 1374 furthermore due to wide floodplains a few centimeters of sediment accumulation herget and meurs 2010 do not make much difference in the floodplain elevation between the 800 ce and 1374 these assumptions justify the use of the 800 ce floodplain topography in our study however different from floodplains the river bed varies considerably over time scales of centuries due to erosion and deposition although this process is stronger in downstream river reaches van der meulen et al 2020 there is a significant difference in the rhine river bathymetry at cologne between the selected palaeo dem and a cross sectional reconstruction by herget and meurs 2010 herget and meurs 2010 reconstructed the discharge magnitude of historic flood events in the rhine river at cologne including the 1374 flood event by using a relatively simple cross sectional approach they defined the river cross section at cologne corresponding to the year 1374 based on the river bathymetry at cologne surveyed in 1895 jasmund 1901 and a river incision rate of 0 1 cm per year the river cross section in 1374 was determined by raising the river cross section in 1895 by a value corresponding to the product of the incision rate and the time length years between the two years 1895 and 1374 according to herget and meurs 2010 the lowest elevation in the cross section at cologne corresponding to the year 1374 was approximately 33 m asl red circle in fig 3 a in comparison the lowest elevation in the cross section at cologne extracted from the palaeo dem used in this study is 36 2 m asl blue circle in fig 3a representing a difference of 3 2 m human activities such as dredging to improve navigation were only carried out later than 1895 herget and meurs 2010 therefore the difference in the river bathymetry can be explained by 1 the accuracy of the palaeo dem 2 the incision rate used in the study of herget and meurs 2010 is smaller compared to the reality 3 the effect of large flood events in the period from 800 ce to 1895 e g 1342 1374 1497 1595 flood events which could cause significant erosion to the riverbanks and beds baynes et al 2015 enw hoogwater 2021 matsumoto et al 2016 and 4 combinations of reasons 1 2 and 3 with this significant difference river bathymetry is included in an uncertainty analysis to investigate its effect on the qmax 1374 by lowering all 1d cross sections representing the main river extracted from palaeo dem with reduced intervals of 0 5 m in level up to 3 5 m fig 3b 3 1 2 hydraulic roughness the hydraulic roughness is expressed as manning s n values which represent the resistance to flow in river channels and floodplains this is an important parameter that greatly affects the water level for a given discharge van der meulen et al 2021 divided the medieval lower rhine valley and delta into five different landscape classes based on the distance to the river and relative floodplain elevation with distinctive land cover natural vegetation and land use characteristics and distinctive hydraulic roughness values fig 4 here the average roughness coefficient for each landscape classes n best table 1 see van der meulen et al 2021 for details is applied in all simulations in addition the lower n min and upper estimates n max of manning s n values table 1 were included in the uncertainty analysis to account for uncertainties in the qmax 1374 that are associated with the hydraulic roughness parameter 3 2 hydraulic model set up a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic model in hec ras brunner 2016 was set up for the study area the main channel of the rhine river was schematized by 500 m spaced 1d profiles along the river channel while the floodplains were discretized on a 2d grid with a resolution of 200 200 m fig 5 the 1d profiles are connected to the 2d grid cells using the weir equation since the flow regime in the natural river and its floodplain are unsteady and highly complex the full momentum equations are used to solve the system brunner 2016 hydraulic structures along the river e g bridges weirs embankments influence the river water levels brunner 2016 costabile et al 2015 teraguchi et al 2011 the present study focuses on the historic flood event in 1374 almost 650 years ago with limited information about the recorded water levels flood marks and the structures e g bridges weirs in the study area maps of cologne and its surrounding for 1571 by mercator and 1792 by wiebeking figs 6 and 7 showed that there was no appearance of special structures bridges or weirs while cologne is a large city located next to the rhine river with many historical activities in roman times therefore it is likely that also no special structures were present in the düsseldorf urdenbach area which is located between the two large cities of cologne and düsseldorf furthermore the water level during the 1374 flood event was extremely high and boats could cross the city s walls in cologne it means the maximum water level was much higher than the bridges and weirs if present therefore we assume that we can neglect the influence of hydraulic structures on the water levels along the river during the 1374 flood event consequently these hydraulic structures are not simulated in the model for the study area 3 2 1 boundary conditions discharge waves at remagen were used as the upstream boundary condition of the model fig 5 an initial discharge of 1000 m3 s was used in all runs to avoid a dry channel at the beginning of the simulations a normal depth was implemented as the downstream boundary condition of the model which was computed based on the friction slope the flow manning s n value and the specified cross section shape using manning s equation brunner 2016 there are two main tributaries of the rhine river located in the model domain namely the sieg river and wupper river fig 1a therefore the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries were included in the model as lateral inflows fig 5 however the historic discharge magnitude at the sieg and wupper tributaries in 1374 is uncertain in this study the discharge time series in 1926 of the sieg tributary and the discharge time series in 1957 of the wupper tributary fig 8 a corresponding to the largest measured discharges so far were used to represent the lateral inflow at the sieg and wupper in all simulations the flood peak of these events occurred at different times however in this study the flood peak of these events was shifted to the same time that the flood peak occurred at remagen to investigate the resonance of these flood events to downstream water levels at points of interest cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach 3 2 2 model calibration model calibration cannot be performed for a case that lacks data in this case we only have the two flood marks corresponding to the 1374 flood event available at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach in addition the accuracy of the topography of the river channel and its floodplains and historic landscape classes is highly uncertain as is inherently the case for any terrain reconstruction with a target age prior to the onset of accurate land surveying techniques and records nevertheless a reasonable reconstruction of the qmax 1374 with the model is feasible via performing an uncertainty analysis in which uncertain parameters are systematically varied river bathymetry hydraulic roughness together with a range of discharge waves discharge waves peak discharge and flood hydrograph shape at the upstream affect downstream water levels bomers et al 2019d dung et al 2015 pol 2014 however for historic flood events both the peak discharge value and hydrograph shape are commonly uncertain therefore in this study the flood hydrograph shape of the 1926 flood event fig 8b see e g bomers et al 2019c which is the largest historical measured discharge in the rhine river at andernach so far was selected to represent a standard hydrograph shape to reconstruct the qmax 1374 the qmax 1374 values are discussed in detail by among others herget and meurs 2010 toonen 2013 van doornik 2013 hegnauer et al 2014 hegnauer et al 2015 van der meulen et al 2021 van der meulen 2021 and van der meulen et al 2022 herget and meurs 2010 found a peak discharge range of the 1374 flood event ranging between 18 800 m3 s and 29 000 m3 s van doornik estimated the qmax 1374 between 18 500 m3 s and 21 200 m3 s however as argued by van der meulen 2021 the qmax 1374 is most likely between the largest measured discharge of 12 000 m3 s and the largest discharges of 24 000 m3 s generated by stochastic weather simulations coupled to hydrological models hegnauer et al 2014 hegnauer et al 2015 therefore in this study the upstream boundary conditions were created by re scaling the discharge wave of the 1926 flood event to peak discharge values varying from 12 000 to 24 000 m3 s with intervals of 2000 m3 s fig 8b 3 3 uncertainty analysis a total of 168 simulations were performed in the uncertainty analysis which are the combinations of different discharge waves 7 peak discharge values with different manning s n values n best n min and n max and the different river bed levels 8 values table 1 to determine the qmax 1374 in addition to performing the above simulations for uncertainty analysis we also conducted additional simulations to evaluate the effect of flood hydrograph shapes and the distribution of land cover classes on the qmax 1374 as outlined below flood hydrograph shapes as mentioned in section 2 the year 1374 witnessed one large flood events with three peaks in the early months with high water levels at cologne around january 4th january 25th and around february 9th to 11th see references in herget and meurs 2010 van der meulen 2021 therefore besides the flood hydrograph shape of the 1926 flood event with one peak red curve in fig 9 used to reconstruct the qmax 1374 we selected two other flood hydrograph shapes with 3 peaks fig 9 to investigate the effect of their shapes on the water level at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach from the dataset of all the grade simulated grade generator of rainfall and discharge extremes hegnauer et al 2014 discharge waves 50 000 years we extracted all years having flood hydrograph shapes with three peaks exceeding a discharge volume of 10 000 m3 s spaced within a period of 10 25 days in the obtained hydrograph shapes we selected two hydrograph shapes that match the description of the 1374 flood event these include 1 a flood hydrograph shape with three peaks with the first peak having the maximum discharge type 1 in fig 9 and 2 a flood hydrograph shape with three peaks with the third peak having the maximum discharge type 2 in fig 9 these flood hydrograph shapes are expected to represent realistic hydrograph shapes that may occur under current climate conditions hegnauer et al 2014 these two flood hydrograph shapes were scaled such that the maximum peak value corresponds with a discharge magnitude of 18 000 m3 s fig 9 which might approximate the qmax 1374 van der meulen et al 2022 the distribution of landscape classes besides manning s n values of the landscape classes the spatial distribution of the landscape classes also affects river water levels the distribution of the proximal floodplain p class in the land cover map fig 3 used in this study is constant along the river with a width of 1 000 m on both sides of the river van der meulen et al 2021 which may not be the case in reality therefore we investigated the effect of the distribution of this landscape class on the qmax 1374 by merging this class with the low distal floodplain dl class and using the average roughness coefficient n best for these land cover classes here we considered two cases 1 the manning s n value of p zone is assigned the same value with the manning s n value of dl zone n p n dl 0 04 s m 1 3 case 1 and 2 the manning s n value of dl zone is assigned the same value of manning s value of p zone n dl n p 0 07 s m 1 3 case 2 3 4 the magnitude of design discharges the data set of measured discharges can be extended with reconstructed historic flood events to get improved quantification of design discharges this especially applies to design discharges corresponding to large return periods to test the effect of the qmax 1374 on design discharge estimates the systematic data set covering the period 1772 2018 was extended with 12 reconstructed historic flood events that occurred in the period 1300 1772 these data were used to create a continuous discharge data set covering the period 1317 2018 using a bootstrap method following the approach of bomers et al 2019a a flood frequency analysis was performed both considering the qmax 1374 by herget and meurs 2010 and using the hydraulic modelling approach adopted in this study to determine the design discharges and their 95 confidence interval for different return periods based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution function given as 1 f x exp ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where three parameters µ σ ξ represent a location scale shape of the distribution function 4 results and discussion 4 1 qmax 1374 the maximum simulated water levels and highest flow depths at cologne and the maximum simulated water levels at düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to all combinations of uncertain parameters investigated are shown in tables 2 4 based on comparisons with flood mark heights at cologne 48 28 m asl and düsseldorf urdenbach 41 69 m asl and flow depth at cologne 13 3 m there is no value of the qmax 1374 corresponding to the uncertainty range of manning s n values and river bed levels resulting in simulated water levels that exactly match both historic flood mark levels at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach this could however be due to the lack of accuracy of recorded historic flood marks at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach as mentioned in section 2 even though the flood mark at cologne was recorded and described in various reliable sources it also has a validated uncertainty while the flood mark at düsseldorf urdenbach was collected recently with unvalidated accuracy considering this here we conclude the qmax 1374 at the upstream boundary to be between 14 400 m3 s and 18 500 m3 s corresponding to manning s n values and river bed levels below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem from 1 5 m to 3 5 m as shown in fig 10 a discharge magnitude of around 18 000 m3 s may be the most realistic magnitude of the 1374 millennium flood event as this magnitude combines with the manning s n values n min n best n max for all land cover classes and river bed levels from 2 5m to 3 5 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem resulted in simulated water levels closest to historic flood marks at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach 4 2 the effect of the different flood hydrograph shapes on water levels figs 11 and 12 show the water level time series at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to the combinations of the three flood hydrograph shapes with manning s n values n best and river bed level 3 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem which is the elevation of the river cross section at cologne that most closely resembles the elevation of the river cross section used by herget and meurs 2010 the results show hardly any significant differences up to 4 cm figs 11 and 12 for the highest water level at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to these flood hydrograph shapes in addition flood extents corresponding to the highest water level in the study area do not differ significantly for the different flood hydrograph shapes fig 13 391 km2 394 km2 and 396 km2 corresponding to flood hydrograph shapes with one peak three peaks type 1 and 2 respectively these minor difference is explained by 1 the relatively long 12 19 days time intervals between the flood peaks 2 the absence of embankments and other flood protection works in the medieval landscape situation of the upper lower rhine river and 3 wide floodplains of the rhine river in the scope of the study area the flood hydrograph shape may have a larger effect on maximum water levels and flood extents in river stretches with narrower floodplains such as the middle rhine river upstream of our study area 4 3 the effect of the distribution of land cover classes on water levels the results figs 14 and 15 show that the considered change in the spatial distribution of the p land cover class does not significantly affect the maximum water level at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach specifically corresponding to the estimated discharge magnitude 14 400 18 500 m3 s for the 1374 flood event in section 4 1 the difference in the maximum water level varies from 0 04 m to 0 12 m at cologne fig 14 and 0 04 m to 0 08 m at düsseldorf urdenbach fig 15 between case 1 yellow curve and baseline red curve that corresponds to the distribution of p class as reconstructed in van der meulen et al 2021 in comparison the difference in the water level between case 2 blue curve and baseline varies from 0 08 m to 0 13 m at cologne fig 14 and 0 07 m to 0 11 m at düsseldorf urdenbach fig 15 4 4 the effect of the discharge of the sieg and wupper tributaries on water levels table 5 shows the maximum water levels at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to the simulations that include and exclude the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries for combinations of manning s n values n best and river bed level 3 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem the results show that the discharges of the sieg and wupper tributaries do not significantly affect the water level at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach specifically without considering the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries the maximum water levels at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to the discharge peaks from 12 000 m3 s to 24 000 m3 s at remagen are lower from 0 11 m to 0 03 m at cologne and from 0 13 m to 0 04 m at düsseldorf urdenbach respectively compared to considering the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries this indicates that the larger the discharge peak at remagen the smaller the influence of the discharge of the sieg and wupper tributaries on the water levels at the cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach and vice versa 4 5 comparison with previous studies on the qmax 1374 reconstruction of the discharge magnitude of the 1374 flood event in the rhine river has also been carried out in some previous studies herget and meurs 2010 van doornik 2013 in the study of herget and meurs 2010 the peak discharge was estimated based on documentary data and a reconstruction of the river s cross section including estimations of channel incisions and anthropogenic modifications of the river and its floodplains a simple cross sectional approach was applied using manning s equation eq 2 to take into account the roughness and channel geometry at cologne only 2 q a r 2 3 s 1 2 n 1 where q is discharge m3 s a is wet cross section area m2 r is hydraulic radius of flow m s is channel slope n is the hydraulic roughness coefficient s m 3 based on this approach herget and meurs 2010 found a qmax 1374 of around 23 200 m3 s with an uncertainty range of between 18 800 m3 s and 29 000 m3 s at cologne considering maximum and minimum roughness coefficient however this uncertainty range was determined based only on the change in roughness coefficient without considering the uncertainty in the river bathymetry van doornik 2013 used a 2d hydraulic modelling approach to reconstruct the qmax 1374 based on this approach van doornik 2013 found a peak discharge range of between 18 500 m3 s and 21 200 m3 s and the most probable discharge was estimated to be 19 500 m3 s at cologne however van doornik s study did not consider the uncertainty in the river bathymetry on the qmax 1374 either due to the disadvantage of using 2d modelling related to computational costs in addition the qmax 1374 values in van doornik s study were determined based on a water level flood mark of around 49 3 m asl without explanation for this selection which is 1 m higher than the flood mark 48 28 m asl at cologne corresponding to the highest observed water level during the 1374 flood event the flood mark elevation used in van doornik s study could be traced back to the wrong selection of the modern period reference level of the current gauge at cologne in the conversion of the historic flood mark to the modern reference level instead of selecting the reference level of 34 98 m asl the modern period reference level of the current gauge at cologne van doornik may have selected a reference level of 35 98 m asl 1 m higher compared to the reference level of the current gauge at cologne which was used between 1782 and 1979 this is consistent with the difference in the elevation of flood marks used in these studies therefore the qmax 1374 in the study of van doornik 2013 might have been overestimated compared to the actual magnitude of this flood event van der meulen et al 2021 performed hydraulic simulations of the pre embankment situation to quantify the historic flood extents and magnitudes for the late holocene period in the lower rhine river valley and upper delta their simulations did not cover the flood events in late medieval times 1250 1500 nevertheless based on the comparison between simulated water levels and flood extents corresponding to each discharge value in the range of 10 000 30 000 m3 s and the existing sedimentary records in the study area they still suggested that only the lower end of the prediction of herget and meurs 2010 corresponding to a peak value of 18 800 m3 s may be most realistic for the discharge magnitude of the 1374 flood event the results of this study and previous studies show a significant difference in the estimated qmax 1374 and especially the results of herget and meurs 2010 differ significantly from other studies the most apparent explanation is related to the differences in the input data used e g river channel and floodplain geometry hydraulic roughness coefficient altitude of the gauge at cologne and approaches applied in these studies regarding the accuracy of the input data the topography and bathymetry of the river and floodplains are the most important inputs in hydraulic simulations to determine the discharge magnitude in the present study this information was extracted from a high resolution palaeo dem for the early medieval time period of van der meulen et al 2020 although there is a significant difference in river bathymetry between herget and meurs s study and that used in the present study this difference was here included through an uncertainty analysis however even in the case of a river bed level 3 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem which is the elevation of the river cross section at cologne that most closely resembles the elevation of the river cross section used by herget and meurs 2010 the difference in the qmax 1374 corresponding to best guess manning s n values in the two studies is still significant 17 500 m3 s compared to 23 200 m3 s approximately 33 this difference derives from the difference in the wet cross section area of the river channel and floodplains at cologne corresponding to the highest water level of 48 28 m asl during the 1374 flood event between the two studies in the study of herget and meurs 2010 the wet cross section area of the river channel and floodplains is 4900 m2 and 10 900 m2 respectively in contrast in this study these values are 4200 m2 and 9400 m2 thus the wet cross section area of the river channel and floodplain for the water level of 48 28 m asl corresponding to the best estimated qmax 1374 in the study of herget and meurs 2010 is approximately 17 and 16 higher respectively compared to the wet cross section area of the river channel and floodplain corresponding to the water level of 48 28 m asl in this study in addition to the wet area of cross section the difference in flow velocity in the river channel and floodplains at cologne may also lead to the difference in the qmax 1374 computed in the two studies the difference in flow velocity derives from the difference in manning s n values for landscape classes and applied approaches used in the two studies the difference in manning s n values for landscape classes between the two studies is shown in table 6 manning s n values n best for landscape classes in the study of herget and meurs 2010 in table 6 are mean values for winter times used to determine the best estimated qmax 1374 23 200 m3 s these values are lower than manning s n values n best for landscape classes used in this study as a result the flow velocity in herget and meurs s study is higher than the flow velocity in this study because the flow velocity is a function that depends on the inverse of the roughness coefficient see eq 2 chow 1959 regarding applied approaches used in the two studies herget and meurs 2010 used a simple cross sectional approach which can only calculate the variety of flow velocities in the different cross section components like the river channel and floodplains for a cross section at cologne without considering the effect of other factors such as the river geometry the distribution of the landscape classes the effect of the flows of tributaries etc around the interest location in contrast this study used the hydraulic modelling approach with 1d and 2d components which can simulate the flow in the river channel and its floodplains to provide more accurate flow velocities and direction at all locations in the river system upstream and downstream of the cross section for discharge estimation this was demonstrated through using manning s n values n best in the study of herget and meurs 2010 for the case of a river bed level 3 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem as mentioned above the difference in the qmax 1374 is still significant 19 200 m3 s corresponding to flood mark level of 48 28 m at cologne compared to 23 200 m3 s approximately 21 while the difference in the river bathymetry and floodplain topography contributes approximately 16 in the difference of the qmax 1374 as discussed above therefore the remaining difference comes from the approaches used in the two studies in other words the applied approaches also contribute to the difference in the qmax 1374 between the two studies table 7 4 6 the magnitude of design discharges flood frequency analysis based on the discharge data extended with the qmax 1374 of this study results in a design discharge with a 100 000 year return period the value used as maximum safety standard in the dutch water policy and 95 confidence interval of 15 700 m3 s and 4 200 m3 s fig 16 respectively in comparison these numbers are 17 700 m3 s and 4 900 m3 s fig 13 when using the qmax 1374 computed by herget and meurs 2010 hence updating the qmax 1374 of this study into the flood frequency analysis results in a significant reduction of 2 000 m3 s 11 8 in the design discharge and 700 m3 s 14 3 in the confidence interval corresponding to a 100 000 year return period compared to using the 1374 reconstructed discharge magnitude of herget and meurs 2010 this reduction in the design discharge magnitude may significantly reduce the investment cost of protection measures along the rhine river the reduction of the 95 confidence interval shows the importance of reconstructing historic flood events with high accuracy since design discharges can now be predicted with more certainty 4 7 a comparison with bayesian markov chain monte carlo statistical methods the use of different methods in flood frequency analysis result in the difference in design discharges the present study inherited the approach of bomers et al 2019a to include historic flood information in flood safety assessments with this approach the length of the measured discharge data set is extended using the bootstrap method while the general approach of the flood frequency analysis is still kept in addition the bootstrap method is not only used to extend the data set for the missing years but also to sample annual maximum discharges based on the uncertainty ranges of reconstructed historic flood events this reduces the uncertainty in design discharges corresponding to large return periods in addition to the approach applied in this study bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc statistical methods can also account for historical information including their uncertainties in flood frequency analysis gaume 2018 payrastre et al 2011 reis and stedinger 2005 however bayesian methods also have several limitations in which selecting a statistical distribution a theoretical mathematical function for the numerical derivations is required to be fitted to the data sets it means that the results depend on a priori parameters gaume 2018 therefore the posterior distributions are highly influenced by the prior distributions which may result in a larger uncertainty of flood frequency relations compared to the influence caused by the errors in discharge measurements neppel et al 2010 the maximum likelihood method can be used to estimate the prior distribution based on the measured data however in this case there were no discharge measurements near the tail of the distributions therefore the advantages of the bayesian mcmc method compared to a traditional flood frequency analysis method still need to be investigated in addition further studies on the difference in uncertainty estimates between the proposed bootstrap method in bomers et al 2019a and bayesian mcmc methods are needed 4 8 the advantages of using a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach in reconstructing historic flood events this study shows that using a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach allows performing an uncertainty analysis to investigate the effect of inherent uncertain parameters e g river bathymetry hydraulic roughness on the discharge magnitude of historic flood events with acceptable computational cost approximate 40 min for each simulation schematizing the main river by 1d profiles allows the adjustment of the river bed level river bathymetry in a flexible way to facilitate an uncertainty analysis which can also be resolved by a 2d modelling approach through indirect adjustment of dem data for a 2d model however such a 2d adjustment is more time consuming in addition simulating floodplains by 2d grids takes the complex flow structures in the river floodplains much better into account compared to a simple approach baker 2008 benito and díez herrero 2014 herget and meurs 2010 webb and jarrett 2002 even though the 2d approach requires more detailed input data e g the topography of floodplains land use classes compared to the simple cross sectional approach of herget and meurs 2010 furthermore using the 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach allows the investigation of the effect of discharge magnitude and flood hydrograph shape on flow parameters flow velocity flow depth in contrast a simple approach can only consider the effect of the discharge magnitude on flow parameters herget and meurs 2010 herget et al 2014 5 conclusions in this study a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach was used to reconstruct the 1374 historic peak discharge qmax 1374 in the rhine river we found that this modelling approach has benefits for historic flood reconstructions compared to previous approaches e g 1d cross sectional approach fully 2d hydraulic modelling approach the 1d 2d modelling approach allows adjusting river bathymetry data more flexible and much faster compared to the 2d modelling approach in performing an uncertainty analysis to investigate the effect of the inherent uncertainties in reconstructing the historic terrain river bathymetry and floodplains topography and hydraulic roughness of the historic landscape on the discharge magnitude of historic flood events the study s results show that the value of the peak discharge during the 1374 flood event qmax 1374 is between 14 400 m3 s and 18 500 m3 s near remagen germany furthermore this study showed that the effect of potential flood hydrograph shapes the spatial distribution of the proximal floodplain land cover class in the land cover map in the rhine river and the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries does not have a significant impact on the highest peak water levels along the river in the study area in the pre embankment era a flood frequency analysis of annual maximum peak flow data including the 1374 historic flood event derived in this study results in the design discharge corresponding to the 100 000 year return period in the rhine river of 15 700 m3 s which is 2 000 m3 s lower than the qmax 1374 estimation of herget and meurs

2272,reconstructions of the most severe historic flood events contribute to improved quantification of design discharges corresponding to large return periods reducing the uncertainty of design discharges has a great significance in constructing proper flood defences to protect the hinterland from future flooding however reconstructions of the peak discharges of such historic flood events are generally associated with large uncertainties which arise from the accuracy of the historic topography hydraulic roughness of the river channels and floodplains and the historic hydrograph shape this study sets up a one dimensional two dimensional 1d 2d coupled hydraulic model stretching from the upstream of bonn at remagen to downstream of düsseldorf germany with the length of 113 km to reconstruct the maximum discharge of the 1374 flood event qmax 1374 which is considered to be the largest flood of the last millennium in the lower rhine catchment an uncertainty analysis was performed by adopting different river bed levels and roughness values in order to estimate the influence of these uncertainties on the reconstructed peak discharge the upstream discharge wave was varied corresponding to a wide range of peak discharges from 12 000 to 24 000 m3 s the resulting qmax 1374 was determined of between 14 400 and 18 500 m3 s were then used in a flood frequency analysis to determine the design discharges corresponding to different return periods compared to the design discharge computed with previous estimations of the 1374 peak discharge we found a significant reduction of 2 000 m3 s in the design discharge corresponding to a 100 000 year return period which is the maximum safety standard adopted in the dutch water policy for some downstream dike sections

main natural hazards causing large damage and human casualties worldwide alfieri et al 2017 arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 even though flood risk is expected to increase due to climate and land use change alfieri et al 2015 brádzil et al 2006 hirabayashi et al 2013 flood events have been a threat since humans began occupying the floodplains of major rivers stanley et al 2001 wu et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 nowadays for many rivers design discharges corresponding to a specific return period are used to construct flood defences to protect the hinterland from extreme flood events these design discharges are generally determined by using a flood frequency analysis in such an analysis the annual maximum discharges of a measured data set or peak values that exceed a certain threshold are selected which are then used to determine the parameters of a probability distribution function bezak et al 2014 gaume 2018 lang et al 1999 schendel and thongwichian 2017 from this fitted distribution function discharges corresponding to different return periods are derived in many countries e g the netherlands norway germany uk us the discharges corresponding to large return periods e g 1000 years 10 000 years 100 000 years are used to design important flood defences e g dams flood barriers dikes however the length of measured discharge data is usually insufficient for a robust flood frequency analysis cameron et al 1999 engeland et al 2018 gebregiorgis and hossain 2012 van alphen 2016 vorogushyn et al 2012 using the limited measured discharge data set to extrapolate to a design discharge corresponding to such large return periods results in large uncertainty intervals in addition to the lower bound of the uncertainty interval that is crucial for flood protection policymaking the upper bound is also important since an extreme overestimation of the design discharge caused by extrapolation may result in unnecessarily large investments to reduce these uncertainty intervals the data set of measured discharges can be extended with reconstructed historic flood events e g bomers et al 2019a frances et al 1994 macdonald et al 2014 sartor et al 2010 in other words improved quantification of design discharges corresponding to large return periods can be achieved by precise reconstruction of the most severe historic flood events therefore many studies have focused on reconstructing historic flood discharges based on various sources such as written records flood marks and flood deposits balasch et al 2010 benito et al 2021 bomers et al 2019b bomers et al 2019c elleder et al 2013 herget and meurs 2010 o connell et al 2002 payrastre et al 2011 reis and stedinger 2005 ruiz bellet et al 2014 stamataki and kjeldsen 2021 toonen et al 2013 toonen et al 2015 van der meulen et al 2021 discharge magnitudes of historic flood events can be reconstructed by using the cross sectional approach or longitudinal approach these two approaches are collectively referred to as simple approaches herget and meurs 2010 webb and jarrett 2002 or multidimensional hydraulic modelling approach 2d and 3d hydraulic models lang et al 2003 sheffer et al 2003 van der meulen et al 2021 van doornik 2013 however reconstructed peak discharges of historic flood events are generally associated with large uncertainties arising from inaccuracies in the historic topography hydraulic roughness of the main river and floodplains and historic hydrograph shape benito and thorndycraft 2003 herget and meurs 2010 lang et al 2003 lang et al 2004 simple approaches can only account for uncertainties in spatial components at selected cross section locations but not in the river system as a whole in addition these approaches can also only consider the effect of peak discharge on river water levels without the hydrograph shape while hydrograph shapes affect water levels and flooding parameters e g flood extent inundation depth duration bomers et al 2019d dung et al 2015 pol 2014 in contrast using a multidimensional hydraulic modelling approach allows for taking into account spatial uncertainties and discharge waves peak discharge and flood hydrograph shape on river water levels bomers et al 2019b lang et al 2003 lang et al 2004 hence this approach can simulate spatial components and river flow closer to reality than simple approaches many hydraulic models such as mike delft3d hec ras isis now flood modeller sobek lisflood fp have been developed over the last decades to address the complex real world hydraulic problems bomers et al 2019b horritt and bates 2002 pasquier et al 2018 van et al 2012 these hydraulic models calculate a rating curve q h by solving the saint venant equations also referred to as the shallow water equations representing the flow in natural rivers and floodplains 1d hydraulic models are commonly used to provide estimates of the flow depth and velocity at locations in the river system with a low computational cost however they are unsuitable for accurately simulating flood propagation especially the complex 2d flow in floodplains in contrast 2d depth averaged hydraulic models can better simulate complex flow patterns and provide more accurate results the main disadvantages of 2d hydraulic models are that they require more in depth data regarding topography and resistance data and have a large computational cost therefore using 2d hydraulic models is generally not deemed suitable for reconstructions of historic flood events especially when uncertainty analysis regarding the most uncertain parameters of the river and floodplains river bathymetry floodplain topography hydraulic roughness are also required necessitating several different simulations in recent years the coupling between 1d and 2d hydraulic models has become popular to combine advantages of both approaches adeogun et al 2015 bomers et al 2019b cardoso et al 2020 dasallas et al 2019 fan et al 2017 leandro and martins 2016 pasquier et al

hydraulic models dasallas et al 2019 fan et al 2017 leandro et al 2016 in this study we use a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach to reconstruct the qmax 1374 in the rhine river at cologne in

the paper ends with conclusions in section 5 2 case study the rhine river is one of the major rivers in europe with a length of 1 230 km and an average discharge of about 2 200 m3 s at lobith in the lower rhine te linde et al 2011 it originates from the alps in switzerland and flows through germany and the netherlands and debouches into the north sea fig 1 a in this study we consider an area of 991 km2 of the rhine river catchment stretching from upstream of bonn to downstream of düsseldorf germany with the length of 113 km fig 1b the upstream boundary of the study area is placed 15 km upstream of the city of bonn at remagen just upstream where the rhine river enters the alluvial reaches of the lower rhine valley erkens et al 2011 klostermann 1992 van der meulen et al 2020 in addition the distance from the upper boundary at remagen to cologne and urdenbach are 32 5 and 81 km respectively 2 1 the 1374 flood event and related historic flood marks the first months of 1374 were characterized by a continuous flood event in several catchments throughout central europe numerous source texts are compiled in alexandre 1987 buismann 1996 weikinn 1958 evidence is handed down mainly by written reports from northern france including paris belgium the netherlands and towards bremen in northern germany for the northward margin of occurrence the river weser and vlatava valleys including prague mark the eastern limits and strasbourg in alsace towards ulm at danube river the southern one due to the long time and missing motivation of quantitative monitoring water level reports of the flood event are rather rare as a characteristic of central europe precipitation occurred by snow and rain with cold periods which resulted in increased discharges due to additional meltwater supply to intensive long lasting rainfall krahe 1997 generally speaking discharge of the northern parts of the rhine river was characterized by high water levels lasting from late december 1373 until april 1374 at cologne peak levels are reported from january 4th january 25th and february 9 11th 1374 the pattern of three peaks is confirmed for the lower rhine fig 1a section with minor delays for january 6th and 21st 25th and february 9 15th the flood event in february is assumed to have the highest water level ever observed at cologne in the past krahe 1997 besides the ice jam flood in 1784 brázdil et al 2010 based on the report of boats crossing the city fortification the minimum water level during peak discharge at cologne can be estimated as 47 70 m above sea level asl the maximum flood water level is estimated to be 48 50 m asl based on the report of the steps of st georgius monastery not being reached herget and meurs 2010 with the above arguments the authors suggest a representative value of 48 28 m asl for the flood peak level at cologne note that all elevation levels mentioned above were transferred to the modern period reference level of the current gauge at an elevation of 34 98 m asl at cologne the second location with water level information of the flood event from within the area of investigation is a flood level marker given at a house in urdenbach fig 2 located just upstream of the city of düsseldorf geodetic surveys result in an elevation of 41 69 m asl the marker is installed at a house located in the valley of itter creek a minor local tributary of the river rhine approximately 500 m upstream of the ancient confluence due to the gentle slope and short distance the water level of the creek is assumed equal to the rhine river during flood events as documented by the repeated flood marks on the building according to the owner of the house the inscription was found during renovation of the house and modified by appearance for better visibility the validity of the marker could not be verified so far but it should be noted that the house itself was built in approximately 1709 several centuries after the flood event unfortunately it is not known so far who made the first inscription of the flood level and what information the elevation is based on it might be speculated that during the inscription of the water level of the ice jam flood of january 1784 the previous top record of water level in 1374 was re marked 3 methodology to reconstruct the qmax 1374 we used an inverse modelling approach van der meulen et al 2021 first the 1d 2d coupled hydraulic model was set up with the past terrain river bathymetry and floodplains topography and hydraulic roughness coefficients for land cover classes corresponding to the medieval situation to simulate discharge waves with different peak discharges an uncertainty analysis was then performed to investigate the effects of the uncertain input parameters river bathymetry and floodplains topography and hydraulic roughness coefficients on the qmax 1374 subsequently the simulated water levels were compared with the flood marks observed water levels corresponding to the 1374 flood event at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach to determine the appropriate discharge magnitude at the upstream boundary the estimated qmax 1374 was used to extend the historical discharge data set a flood frequency analysis was then performed based on the extended discharge data set to determine the design discharges and their 95 confidence interval for different return periods 3 1 data 3 1 1 topography and bathymetry the past river bathymetry and floodplain topography play an important role in reconstructing historic flood events e g benito and thorndycraft 2004 herget and meurs 2010 lang et al 2004 however these data for the year 1374 are not available therefore a section of the palaeo dem with a 10 mresolution of the lower rhine valley and upper delta in early medieval times circa 800 ce fig 1 reconstructed by van der meulen et al 2020 was used for this study this palaeo dem was reconstructed based on a ground level lidar dem which was obtained by merging the available lidar data ahn2 in the netherlands national grid and dgm1 resampled from the german to the netherlands grid and inserting the river bathymetry from the rws lanuv baseline datasets the lidar dem was corrected for elevation change due to the recent mining induced subsidence harnischmacher and zepp 2014 existing geological mapping datasets were then used to demarcate inactive and active zones in the dem see van der meulen et al 2020 for more details all anthropogenic relief elements were removed using separate procedures for linear e g roads railroads dikes and non linear e g pits raised grounds for buildings dump sites elements to obtain the palaeotopography of the inactive zone then geological and historical geographical information were incorporated to reconstruct the natural floodplain topography and the river position and bathymetry in the active zone for the target age of palaeo dem van der meulen et al 2020 in this study it was assumed that there were no significant interventions in the floodplains between the 800 ce and 1374 furthermore due to wide floodplains a few centimeters of sediment accumulation herget and meurs 2010 do not make much difference in the floodplain elevation between the 800 ce and 1374 these assumptions justify the use of the 800 ce floodplain topography in our study however different from floodplains the river bed varies considerably over time scales of centuries due to erosion and deposition although this process is stronger in downstream river reaches van der meulen et al 2020 there is a significant difference in the rhine river bathymetry at cologne between the selected palaeo dem and a cross sectional reconstruction by herget and meurs 2010 herget and meurs 2010 reconstructed the discharge magnitude of historic flood events in the rhine river at cologne including the 1374 flood event by using a relatively simple cross sectional approach they defined the river cross section at cologne corresponding to the year 1374 based on the river bathymetry at cologne surveyed in 1895 jasmund 1901 and a river incision rate of 0 1 cm per year the river cross section in 1374 was determined by raising the river cross section in 1895 by a value corresponding to the product of the incision rate and the time length years between the two years 1895 and 1374 according to herget and meurs 2010 the lowest elevation in the cross section at cologne corresponding to the year 1374 was approximately 33 m asl red circle in fig 3 a in comparison the lowest elevation in the cross section at cologne extracted from the palaeo dem used in this study is 36 2 m asl blue circle in fig 3a representing a difference of 3 2 m human activities such as dredging to improve navigation were only carried out later than 1895 herget and meurs 2010 therefore the difference in the river bathymetry can be explained by 1 the accuracy of the palaeo dem 2 the incision rate used in the study of herget and meurs 2010 is smaller compared to the reality 3 the effect of large flood events in the period from 800 ce to 1895 e g 1342 1374 1497 1595 flood events which could cause significant erosion to the riverbanks and beds baynes et al 2015 enw hoogwater 2021 matsumoto et al 2016 and 4 combinations of reasons 1 2 and 3 with this significant difference river bathymetry is included in an uncertainty analysis to investigate its effect on the qmax 1374 by lowering all 1d cross sections representing the main river extracted from palaeo dem with reduced intervals of 0 5 m in level up to 3 5 m fig 3b 3 1 2 hydraulic roughness the hydraulic roughness is expressed as manning s n values which represent the resistance to flow in river channels and floodplains this is an important parameter that greatly affects the water level for a given discharge van der meulen et al 2021 divided the medieval lower rhine valley and delta into five different landscape classes based on the distance to the river and relative floodplain elevation with distinctive land cover natural vegetation and land use characteristics and distinctive hydraulic roughness values fig 4 here the average roughness coefficient for each landscape classes n best table 1 see van der meulen et al 2021 for details is applied in all simulations in addition the lower n min and upper estimates n max of manning s n values table 1 were included in the uncertainty analysis to account for uncertainties in the qmax 1374 that are associated with the hydraulic roughness parameter 3 2 hydraulic model set up a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic model in hec ras brunner 2016 was set up for the study area the main channel of the rhine river was schematized by 500 m spaced 1d profiles along the river channel while the floodplains were discretized on a 2d grid with a resolution of 200 200 m fig 5 the 1d profiles are connected to the 2d grid cells using the weir equation since the flow regime in the natural river and its floodplain are unsteady and highly complex the full momentum equations are used to solve the system brunner 2016 hydraulic structures along the river e g bridges weirs embankments influence the river water levels brunner 2016 costabile et al 2015 teraguchi et al 2011 the present study focuses on the historic flood event in 1374 almost 650 years ago with limited information about the recorded water levels flood marks and the structures e g bridges weirs in the study area maps of cologne and its surrounding for 1571 by mercator and 1792 by wiebeking figs 6 and 7 showed that there was no appearance of special structures bridges or weirs while cologne is a large city located next to the rhine river with many historical activities in roman times therefore it is likely that also no special structures were present in the düsseldorf urdenbach area which is located between the two large cities of cologne and düsseldorf furthermore the water level during the 1374 flood event was extremely high and boats could cross the city s walls in cologne it means the maximum water level was much higher than the bridges and weirs if present therefore we assume that we can neglect the influence of hydraulic structures on the water levels along the river during the 1374 flood event consequently these hydraulic structures are not simulated in the model for the study area 3 2 1 boundary conditions discharge waves at remagen were used as the upstream boundary condition of the model fig 5 an initial discharge of 1000 m3 s was used in all runs to avoid a dry channel at the beginning of the simulations a normal depth was implemented as the downstream boundary condition of the model which was computed based on the friction slope the flow manning s n value and the specified cross section shape using manning s equation brunner 2016 there are two main tributaries of the rhine river located in the model domain namely the sieg river and wupper river fig 1a therefore the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries were included in the model as lateral inflows fig 5 however the historic discharge magnitude at the sieg and wupper tributaries in 1374 is uncertain in this study the discharge time series in 1926 of the sieg tributary and the discharge time series in 1957 of the wupper tributary fig 8 a corresponding to the largest measured discharges so far were used to represent the lateral inflow at the sieg and wupper in all simulations the flood peak of these events occurred at different times however in this study the flood peak of these events was shifted to the same time that the flood peak occurred at remagen to investigate the resonance of these flood events to downstream water levels at points of interest cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach 3 2 2 model calibration model calibration cannot be performed for a case that lacks data in this case we only have the two flood marks corresponding to the 1374 flood event available at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach in addition the accuracy of the topography of the river channel and its floodplains and historic landscape classes is highly uncertain as is inherently the case for any terrain reconstruction with a target age prior to the onset of accurate land surveying techniques and records nevertheless a reasonable reconstruction of the qmax 1374 with the model is feasible via performing an uncertainty analysis in which uncertain parameters are systematically varied river bathymetry hydraulic roughness together with a range of discharge waves discharge waves peak discharge and flood hydrograph shape at the upstream affect downstream water levels bomers et al 2019d dung et al 2015 pol 2014 however for historic flood events both the peak discharge value and hydrograph shape are commonly uncertain therefore in this study the flood hydrograph shape of the 1926 flood event fig 8b see e g bomers et al 2019c which is the largest historical measured discharge in the rhine river at andernach so far was selected to represent a standard hydrograph shape to reconstruct the qmax 1374 the qmax 1374 values are discussed in detail by among others herget and meurs 2010 toonen 2013 van doornik 2013 hegnauer et al 2014 hegnauer et al 2015 van der meulen et al 2021 van der meulen 2021 and van der meulen et al 2022 herget and meurs 2010 found a peak discharge range of the 1374 flood event ranging between 18 800 m3 s and 29 000 m3 s van doornik estimated the qmax 1374 between 18 500 m3 s and 21 200 m3 s however as argued by van der meulen 2021 the qmax 1374 is most likely between the largest measured discharge of 12 000 m3 s and the largest discharges of 24 000 m3 s generated by stochastic weather simulations coupled to hydrological models hegnauer et al 2014 hegnauer et al 2015 therefore in this study the upstream boundary conditions were created by re scaling the discharge wave of the 1926 flood event to peak discharge values varying from 12 000 to 24 000 m3 s with intervals of 2000 m3 s fig 8b 3 3 uncertainty analysis a total of 168 simulations were performed in the uncertainty analysis which are the combinations of different discharge waves 7 peak discharge values with different manning s n values n best n min and n max and the different river bed levels 8 values table 1 to determine the qmax 1374 in addition to performing the above simulations for uncertainty analysis we also conducted additional simulations to evaluate the effect of flood hydrograph shapes and the distribution of land cover classes on the qmax 1374 as outlined below flood hydrograph shapes as mentioned in section 2 the year 1374 witnessed one large flood events with three peaks in the early months with high water levels at cologne around january 4th january 25th and around february 9th to 11th see references in herget and meurs 2010 van der meulen 2021 therefore besides the flood hydrograph shape of the 1926 flood event with one peak red curve in fig 9 used to reconstruct the qmax 1374 we selected two other flood hydrograph shapes with 3 peaks fig 9 to investigate the effect of their shapes on the water level at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach from the dataset of all the grade simulated grade generator of rainfall and discharge extremes hegnauer et al 2014 discharge waves 50 000 years we extracted all years having flood hydrograph shapes with three peaks exceeding a discharge volume of 10 000 m3 s spaced within a period of 10 25 days in the obtained hydrograph shapes we selected two hydrograph shapes that match the description of the 1374 flood event these include 1 a flood hydrograph shape with three peaks with the first peak having the maximum discharge type 1 in fig 9 and 2 a flood hydrograph shape with three peaks with the third peak having the maximum discharge type 2 in fig 9 these flood hydrograph shapes are expected to represent realistic hydrograph shapes that may occur under current climate conditions hegnauer et al 2014 these two flood hydrograph shapes were scaled such that the maximum peak value corresponds with a discharge magnitude of 18 000 m3 s fig 9 which might approximate the qmax 1374 van der meulen et al 2022 the distribution of landscape classes besides manning s n values of the landscape classes the spatial distribution of the landscape classes also affects river water levels the distribution of the proximal floodplain p class in the land cover map fig 3 used in this study is constant along the river with a width of 1 000 m on both sides of the river van der meulen et al 2021 which may not be the case in reality therefore we investigated the effect of the distribution of this landscape class on the qmax 1374 by merging this class with the low distal floodplain dl class and using the average roughness coefficient n best for these land cover classes here we considered two cases 1 the manning s n value of p zone is assigned the same value with the manning s n value of dl zone n p n dl 0 04 s m 1 3 case 1 and 2 the manning s n value of dl zone is assigned the same value of manning s value of p zone n dl n p 0 07 s m 1 3 case 2 3 4 the magnitude of design discharges the data set of measured discharges can be extended with reconstructed historic flood events to get improved quantification of design discharges this especially applies to design discharges corresponding to large return periods to test the effect of the qmax 1374 on design discharge estimates the systematic data set covering the period 1772 2018 was extended with 12 reconstructed historic flood events that occurred in the period 1300 1772 these data were used to create a continuous discharge data set covering the period 1317 2018 using a bootstrap method following the approach of bomers et al 2019a a flood frequency analysis was performed both considering the qmax 1374 by herget and meurs 2010 and using the hydraulic modelling approach adopted in this study to determine the design discharges and their 95 confidence interval for different return periods based on the generalized extreme value gev distribution function given as 1 f x exp ξ x μ σ 1 ξ where three parameters µ σ ξ represent a location scale shape of the distribution function 4 results and discussion 4 1 qmax 1374 the maximum simulated water levels and highest flow depths at cologne and the maximum simulated water levels at düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to all combinations of uncertain parameters investigated are shown in tables 2 4 based on comparisons with flood mark heights at cologne 48 28 m asl and düsseldorf urdenbach 41 69 m asl and flow depth at cologne 13 3 m there is no value of the qmax 1374 corresponding to the uncertainty range of manning s n values and river bed levels resulting in simulated water levels that exactly match both historic flood mark levels at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach this could however be due to the lack of accuracy of recorded historic flood marks at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach as mentioned in section 2 even though the flood mark at cologne was recorded and described in various reliable sources it also has a validated uncertainty while the flood mark at düsseldorf urdenbach was collected recently with unvalidated accuracy considering this here we conclude the qmax 1374 at the upstream boundary to be between 14 400 m3 s and 18 500 m3 s corresponding to manning s n values and river bed levels below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem from 1 5 m to 3 5 m as shown in fig 10 a discharge magnitude of around 18 000 m3 s may be the most realistic magnitude of the 1374 millennium flood event as this magnitude combines with the manning s n values n min n best n max for all land cover classes and river bed levels from 2 5m to 3 5 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem resulted in simulated water levels closest to historic flood marks at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach 4 2 the effect of the different flood hydrograph shapes on water levels figs 11 and 12 show the water level time series at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to the combinations of the three flood hydrograph shapes with manning s n values n best and river bed level 3 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem which is the elevation of the river cross section at cologne that most closely resembles the elevation of the river cross section used by herget and meurs 2010 the results show hardly any significant differences up to 4 cm figs 11 and 12 for the highest water level at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to these flood hydrograph shapes in addition flood extents corresponding to the highest water level in the study area do not differ significantly for the different flood hydrograph shapes fig 13 391 km2 394 km2 and 396 km2 corresponding to flood hydrograph shapes with one peak three peaks type 1 and 2 respectively these minor difference is explained by 1 the relatively long 12 19 days time intervals between the flood peaks 2 the absence of embankments and other flood protection works in the medieval landscape situation of the upper lower rhine river and 3 wide floodplains of the rhine river in the scope of the study area the flood hydrograph shape may have a larger effect on maximum water levels and flood extents in river stretches with narrower floodplains such as the middle rhine river upstream of our study area 4 3 the effect of the distribution of land cover classes on water levels the results figs 14 and 15 show that the considered change in the spatial distribution of the p land cover class does not significantly affect the maximum water level at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach specifically corresponding to the estimated discharge magnitude 14 400 18 500 m3 s for the 1374 flood event in section 4 1 the difference in the maximum water level varies from 0 04 m to 0 12 m at cologne fig 14 and 0 04 m to 0 08 m at düsseldorf urdenbach fig 15 between case 1 yellow curve and baseline red curve that corresponds to the distribution of p class as reconstructed in van der meulen et al 2021 in comparison the difference in the water level between case 2 blue curve and baseline varies from 0 08 m to 0 13 m at cologne fig 14 and 0 07 m to 0 11 m at düsseldorf urdenbach fig 15 4 4 the effect of the discharge of the sieg and wupper tributaries on water levels table 5 shows the maximum water levels at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to the simulations that include and exclude the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries for combinations of manning s n values n best and river bed level 3 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem the results show that the discharges of the sieg and wupper tributaries do not significantly affect the water level at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach specifically without considering the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries the maximum water levels at cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach corresponding to the discharge peaks from 12 000 m3 s to 24 000 m3 s at remagen are lower from 0 11 m to 0 03 m at cologne and from 0 13 m to 0 04 m at düsseldorf urdenbach respectively compared to considering the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries this indicates that the larger the discharge peak at remagen the smaller the influence of the discharge of the sieg and wupper tributaries on the water levels at the cologne and düsseldorf urdenbach and vice versa 4 5 comparison with previous studies on the qmax 1374 reconstruction of the discharge magnitude of the 1374 flood event in the rhine river has also been carried out in some previous studies herget and meurs 2010 van doornik 2013 in the study of herget and meurs 2010 the peak discharge was estimated based on documentary data and a reconstruction of the river s cross section including estimations of channel incisions and anthropogenic modifications of the river and its floodplains a simple cross sectional approach was applied using manning s equation eq 2 to take into account the roughness and channel geometry at cologne only 2 q a r 2 3 s 1 2 n 1 where q is discharge m3 s a is wet cross section area m2 r is hydraulic radius of flow m s is channel slope n is the hydraulic roughness coefficient s m 3 based on this approach herget and meurs 2010 found a qmax 1374 of around 23 200 m3 s with an uncertainty range of between 18 800 m3 s and 29 000 m3 s at cologne considering maximum and minimum roughness coefficient however this uncertainty range was determined based only on the change in roughness coefficient without considering the uncertainty in the river bathymetry van doornik 2013 used a 2d hydraulic modelling approach to reconstruct the qmax 1374 based on this approach van doornik 2013 found a peak discharge range of between 18 500 m3 s and 21 200 m3 s and the most probable discharge was estimated to be 19 500 m3 s at cologne however van doornik s study did not consider the uncertainty in the river bathymetry on the qmax 1374 either due to the disadvantage of using 2d modelling related to computational costs in addition the qmax 1374 values in van doornik s study were determined based on a water level flood mark of around 49 3 m asl without explanation for this selection which is 1 m higher than the flood mark 48 28 m asl at cologne corresponding to the highest observed water level during the 1374 flood event the flood mark elevation used in van doornik s study could be traced back to the wrong selection of the modern period reference level of the current gauge at cologne in the conversion of the historic flood mark to the modern reference level instead of selecting the reference level of 34 98 m asl the modern period reference level of the current gauge at cologne van doornik may have selected a reference level of 35 98 m asl 1 m higher compared to the reference level of the current gauge at cologne which was used between 1782 and 1979 this is consistent with the difference in the elevation of flood marks used in these studies therefore the qmax 1374 in the study of van doornik 2013 might have been overestimated compared to the actual magnitude of this flood event van der meulen et al 2021 performed hydraulic simulations of the pre embankment situation to quantify the historic flood extents and magnitudes for the late holocene period in the lower rhine river valley and upper delta their simulations did not cover the flood events in late medieval times 1250 1500 nevertheless based on the comparison between simulated water levels and flood extents corresponding to each discharge value in the range of 10 000 30 000 m3 s and the existing sedimentary records in the study area they still suggested that only the lower end of the prediction of herget and meurs 2010 corresponding to a peak value of 18 800 m3 s may be most realistic for the discharge magnitude of the 1374 flood event the results of this study and previous studies show a significant difference in the estimated qmax 1374 and especially the results of herget and meurs 2010 differ significantly from other studies the most apparent explanation is related to the differences in the input data used e g river channel and floodplain geometry hydraulic roughness coefficient altitude of the gauge at cologne and approaches applied in these studies regarding the accuracy of the input data the topography and bathymetry of the river and floodplains are the most important inputs in hydraulic simulations to determine the discharge magnitude in the present study this information was extracted from a high resolution palaeo dem for the early medieval time period of van der meulen et al 2020 although there is a significant difference in river bathymetry between herget and meurs s study and that used in the present study this difference was here included through an uncertainty analysis however even in the case of a river bed level 3 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem which is the elevation of the river cross section at cologne that most closely resembles the elevation of the river cross section used by herget and meurs 2010 the difference in the qmax 1374 corresponding to best guess manning s n values in the two studies is still significant 17 500 m3 s compared to 23 200 m3 s approximately 33 this difference derives from the difference in the wet cross section area of the river channel and floodplains at cologne corresponding to the highest water level of 48 28 m asl during the 1374 flood event between the two studies in the study of herget and meurs 2010 the wet cross section area of the river channel and floodplains is 4900 m2 and 10 900 m2 respectively in contrast in this study these values are 4200 m2 and 9400 m2 thus the wet cross section area of the river channel and floodplain for the water level of 48 28 m asl corresponding to the best estimated qmax 1374 in the study of herget and meurs 2010 is approximately 17 and 16 higher respectively compared to the wet cross section area of the river channel and floodplain corresponding to the water level of 48 28 m asl in this study in addition to the wet area of cross section the difference in flow velocity in the river channel and floodplains at cologne may also lead to the difference in the qmax 1374 computed in the two studies the difference in flow velocity derives from the difference in manning s n values for landscape classes and applied approaches used in the two studies the difference in manning s n values for landscape classes between the two studies is shown in table 6 manning s n values n best for landscape classes in the study of herget and meurs 2010 in table 6 are mean values for winter times used to determine the best estimated qmax 1374 23 200 m3 s these values are lower than manning s n values n best for landscape classes used in this study as a result the flow velocity in herget and meurs s study is higher than the flow velocity in this study because the flow velocity is a function that depends on the inverse of the roughness coefficient see eq 2 chow 1959 regarding applied approaches used in the two studies herget and meurs 2010 used a simple cross sectional approach which can only calculate the variety of flow velocities in the different cross section components like the river channel and floodplains for a cross section at cologne without considering the effect of other factors such as the river geometry the distribution of the landscape classes the effect of the flows of tributaries etc around the interest location in contrast this study used the hydraulic modelling approach with 1d and 2d components which can simulate the flow in the river channel and its floodplains to provide more accurate flow velocities and direction at all locations in the river system upstream and downstream of the cross section for discharge estimation this was demonstrated through using manning s n values n best in the study of herget and meurs 2010 for the case of a river bed level 3 m below the early medieval level extracted from the palaeo dem as mentioned above the difference in the qmax 1374 is still significant 19 200 m3 s corresponding to flood mark level of 48 28 m at cologne compared to 23 200 m3 s approximately 21 while the difference in the river bathymetry and floodplain topography contributes approximately 16 in the difference of the qmax 1374 as discussed above therefore the remaining difference comes from the approaches used in the two studies in other words the applied approaches also contribute to the difference in the qmax 1374 between the two studies table 7 4 6 the magnitude of design discharges flood frequency analysis based on the discharge data extended with the qmax 1374 of this study results in a design discharge with a 100 000 year return period the value used as maximum safety standard in the dutch water policy and 95 confidence interval of 15 700 m3 s and 4 200 m3 s fig 16 respectively in comparison these numbers are 17 700 m3 s and 4 900 m3 s fig 13 when using the qmax 1374 computed by herget and meurs 2010 hence updating the qmax 1374 of this study into the flood frequency analysis results in a significant reduction of 2 000 m3 s 11 8 in the design discharge and 700 m3 s 14 3 in the confidence interval corresponding to a 100 000 year return period compared to using the 1374 reconstructed discharge magnitude of herget and meurs 2010 this reduction in the design discharge magnitude may significantly reduce the investment cost of protection measures along the rhine river the reduction of the 95 confidence interval shows the importance of reconstructing historic flood events with high accuracy since design discharges can now be predicted with more certainty 4 7 a comparison with bayesian markov chain monte carlo statistical methods the use of different methods in flood frequency analysis result in the difference in design discharges the present study inherited the approach of bomers et al 2019a to include historic flood information in flood safety assessments with this approach the length of the measured discharge data set is extended using the bootstrap method while the general approach of the flood frequency analysis is still kept in addition the bootstrap method is not only used to extend the data set for the missing years but also to sample annual maximum discharges based on the uncertainty ranges of reconstructed historic flood events this reduces the uncertainty in design discharges corresponding to large return periods in addition to the approach applied in this study bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc statistical methods can also account for historical information including their uncertainties in flood frequency analysis gaume 2018 payrastre et al 2011 reis and stedinger 2005 however bayesian methods also have several limitations in which selecting a statistical distribution a theoretical mathematical function for the numerical derivations is required to be fitted to the data sets it means that the results depend on a priori parameters gaume 2018 therefore the posterior distributions are highly influenced by the prior distributions which may result in a larger uncertainty of flood frequency relations compared to the influence caused by the errors in discharge measurements neppel et al 2010 the maximum likelihood method can be used to estimate the prior distribution based on the measured data however in this case there were no discharge measurements near the tail of the distributions therefore the advantages of the bayesian mcmc method compared to a traditional flood frequency analysis method still need to be investigated in addition further studies on the difference in uncertainty estimates between the proposed bootstrap method in bomers et al 2019a and bayesian mcmc methods are needed 4 8 the advantages of using a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach in reconstructing historic flood events this study shows that using a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach allows performing an uncertainty analysis to investigate the effect of inherent uncertain parameters e g river bathymetry hydraulic roughness on the discharge magnitude of historic flood events with acceptable computational cost approximate 40 min for each simulation schematizing the main river by 1d profiles allows the adjustment of the river bed level river bathymetry in a flexible way to facilitate an uncertainty analysis which can also be resolved by a 2d modelling approach through indirect adjustment of dem data for a 2d model however such a 2d adjustment is more time consuming in addition simulating floodplains by 2d grids takes the complex flow structures in the river floodplains much better into account compared to a simple approach baker 2008 benito and díez herrero 2014 herget and meurs 2010 webb and jarrett 2002 even though the 2d approach requires more detailed input data e g the topography of floodplains land use classes compared to the simple cross sectional approach of herget and meurs 2010 furthermore using the 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach allows the investigation of the effect of discharge magnitude and flood hydrograph shape on flow parameters flow velocity flow depth in contrast a simple approach can only consider the effect of the discharge magnitude on flow parameters herget and meurs 2010 herget et al 2014 5 conclusions in this study a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic modelling approach was used to reconstruct the 1374 historic peak discharge qmax 1374 in the rhine river we found that this modelling approach has benefits for historic flood reconstructions compared to previous approaches e g 1d cross sectional approach fully 2d hydraulic modelling approach the 1d 2d modelling approach allows adjusting river bathymetry data more flexible and much faster compared to the 2d modelling approach in performing an uncertainty analysis to investigate the effect of the inherent uncertainties in reconstructing the historic terrain river bathymetry and floodplains topography and hydraulic roughness of the historic landscape on the discharge magnitude of historic flood events the study s results show that the value of the peak discharge during the 1374 flood event qmax 1374 is between 14 400 m3 s and 18 500 m3 s near remagen germany furthermore this study showed that the effect of potential flood hydrograph shapes the spatial distribution of the proximal floodplain land cover class in the land cover map in the rhine river and the flows of the sieg and wupper tributaries does not have a significant impact on the highest peak water levels along the river in the study area in the pre embankment era a flood frequency analysis of annual maximum peak flow data including the 1374 historic flood event derived in this study results in the design discharge corresponding to the 100 000 year return period in the rhine river of 15 700 m3 s which is 2 000 m3 s lower than the qmax 1374 estimation of herget and meurs

2273,satellite based soil moisture sm retrieval within agricultural regions is challenging due to pronounced vegetation and land cover variations during the growing season vegetation water content vwc used to describe vegetation opacity in both the soil moisture active passive smap dual channel algorithm dca and v polarization single channel algorithm sca v is approximated using a climatological normalized difference vegetation index ndvi time series to understand the impact of vwc algorithms on smap sm retrievals we investigated optimal vegetation indices for vwc estimation and further evaluated the impact of vwc uncertainty on dca and sca v sm retrievals besides ndvi we applied four dynamic vegetation indices vis acquired from sentinel 2 including two red edge vis modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index mcari and inverted red edge chlorophyll index ireci and two non red edge vis normalized difference water index ndwi1 and ndwi2 to estimate growing season corn vwc and the impact of different empirical relationships on vwc estimates we find that climatological ndvi from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis significantly underestimates vwc and therefore underestimates sm over croplands in northwest china during the growing season whereas dynamic vis can improve the accuracy of vwc and sm retrievals with respect to the choice of vi for vwc estimation mcari is more accurate during the peak growing season compared to its counterpart non red edge vis however it also overestimates vwc during the early growing stage in addition the influence of vwc uncertainty on sm accuracy is shown to be higher in sca v than in dca the results of this study provide insight into preferred approaches for the accurate estimation of vwc and associated

40 konings et al 2015 gao et al 2020c several inversion algorithms for producing sm products have been developed wigneron et al 2017 gao et al 2020b 2021 li et al 2022a 2022b among them the single channel algorithm based on vertical polarization sca v and the dual channel algorithm dca are the baseline algorithms used to generate official smap sm products o neill et al 2021a previous studies have suggested that the uncertainty of sm products from sca v and dca is marginally less than other algorithms products gao et al 2021 in both algorithms the required parameter for canopy opacity is the vegetation optical depth vod which is estimated differently in the sca v and dca in the sca v a climatological vod value is estimated from vegetation water content vwc based on its empirical relationship with vegetation indices vis jackson et al 1999 the vi for estimating vwc in smap sm retrieval algorithms is the climatological normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained from averaging multi year moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis chan et al 2013 radiance measurements in contrast to sca v dca utilizes both h and v polarization information to estimate vod and adds a regularization term to reduce spatial and temporal noise associated with the dual polarization inversion problem o neill et al 2021a this regularization term is based on a prior

measurements across a variety of vegetation types jackson et al 1999 second vod is estimated from vwc using an empirical linear equation based on different land cover types jackson and schmugge 1991 o neill et al 2021a finally 10 day vod climatology is produced from modis ndvi climatology composites based on the relationship established in the previous two steps since this static ndvi climatology cannot capture reported phenological shifts associated with global warming or the impact of inter annual vegetation variations due to drought and fluvial conditions colliander et al 2019 fan et al 2020 gao et al 2020a shen et al 2022 the direct use of ndvi derived vod climatology in sm retrieval algorithms can lead to reduced sm accuracy judge et al 2021 this raises two questions 1 can dynamic vis be used to obtain vwc and vod estimates that significantly improve sm retrievals relative to the current smap approach of utilizing an ndvi climatology to estimate vwc and vod and 2 are alternative vis superior to modis based ndvi for vod estimates utilized by smap sm retrievals this second question is made more relevant by the advanced age of the modis sensors onboard the nasa terra and aqua satellites which have both been in service for almost twenty years terra launched in 1999 aqua launched in 2002 to answer these two questions we will test multiple vis acquired from sentinel 2 launched in 2015 including two red edge vis the modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index mcari daughtry et al 2000 and the inverted red edge chlorophyll index ireci guyot and baret 1988 clevers et al 2000 and two non red edge vis normalized difference water index ndwi1 and ndwi2 the red edge vis are selected due to their high sensitivity to leaf chlorophyll content lcc and their value for monitoring vegetation health and functioning frampton et al 2013 dong et al 2020 between the two red edge vis mcari is highly sensitive to background reflectance properties daughtry et al 2000 and ireci is less affected by red band reflectance and thus less likely to saturate frampton et al 2013 note that there is an emerging discussion regarding the use of microwave based vis for sm retrieval wang et al 2021 whereas it falls outside the scope of this study the organization of this work is as follows the details of the study area are described in section 2 1 section 2 2 introduces the datasets used for vwc estimation and sm retrieval i e in situ measurements of sm and vwc the smap sm product and ancillary datasets for retrieving sm and four vis introduced above our methodology

vis on the quality of sm retrievals in section 4 we provide insights into sm retrieval uncertainty associated with vwc errors based on red edge and non red edge vis in dca and compare the sensitivity of sca v and dca sm retrievals to errors in vwc our conclusions are then summarized in section 5 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area our study area is the heihe river basin hrb fig 1 it is the second largest endorheic basin in the arid and semiarid region of northwestern china and features a temperate continental arid climate the annual precipitation of hrb ranges between 100 and 250 mm with over 60 concentrated between june and september mean annual potential evapotranspiration in hrb is approximately 1200 1800 mm li et al 2013 a major agriculture region is located in the middle reach of hrb fig 1 where the main crop is corn zea mays l xu et al 2019 with planting time in mid april in recent years with the extension of corn planting area hrb has become an increasingly important corn producing area in china tan and zheng 2017 in this study we focus on vwc estimation and sm retrieval over cornfield which is the prevailing crop type in our study area and has high water demand during the growing season 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 in situ measurements of vwc and sm the vwc measurements were collected from 3 sample sites located in the relatively homogeneous corn growing areas within the middle reach of hrb geng and che 2021a 2021b the in situ vwc dataset is provided by the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn for each site the vwc sampling was conducted during the growing season may to september of 2017 2018 the sampling interval is five days except during the end of corn growth stage around september table a1 for crops the vwc kg m2 was calculated by fresh weight w fresh kg dry weight w dry kg plant spacing x m row spacing y m and plants number n as 1 vwc w fresh w dry x y n in addition to be consistent with regional spatial resolution of 1 km modis ndvi three adjacent vwc sample sites within a single 1 km pixel were averaged to represent a single site labeled as daman in fig 1 and therefore a single time series for the establishment of the vi vwc empirical relationship based on sentinel 2 ndvi values we removed the in situ vwc samples with corresponding ndvi 0 1 and obtained 39 effective in situ vwc samples during the 2017 2018 growing seasons besides we have collected in situ vwc measurements from humid and semi humid regions for supplementary validation of vi vwc relationships established at this site daman in 2017 2018 in situ sm measurements are provided by a national network of chinese automatic soil moisture observation stations casmos han et al 2017 there are three casmos sites with corn cover in our study area fig 1 at each casmos site frequency domain reflectometry based instruments were used to record hourly volumetric soil moisture content at soil depths between 0 and 50 cm with a 10 cm vertical interval these hourly soil moisture observations were then aggregated into daily values for each layer daily values with less than five hourly soil moisture measurements were excluded since the sm retrievals from l band microwave are within 5 cm of the surface we selected the in situ sm measurement acquired at depth of 10 cm for evaluation qiu et al 2021 for each casmos site we removed the abnormal sm values based on precipitation observations from automatic weather stations nearby the removed abnormal sm values occurred mostly at site 52652 between june 25 and august 5 in 2018 the details of each casmos site are shown in table 1 2 2 2 smap l3 product the smap mission was launched in 2015 and has been providing scientific data ever since the primary objective of smap is to produce a global mapping of high resolution sm every 2 3 days in this study the daily sm baseline retrievals were provided by smap enhanced l3 radiometer global daily 9 km ease grid sm product l3 sm p e version 5 o neill et al 2021b here both h v polarized tb and sm retrievals based on the sca v and dca algorithms from descending orbit 6 00 am local solar time were used since october 2021 dca has been the current baseline algorithm for all official smap l2 3 radiometer based sm products prior to that the official one was sca v nevertheless smap sm retrieval products based on both algorithms are currently being released to the public required ancillary datasets for smap sm retrievals including effective surface temperature t eff soil texture and surface roughness coefficient h were collected from the smap l3 sm p e product for examination of the sca v and dca in addition 9 km vwc values were extracted from the smap l3 sm p e product its time series at the in situ vwc site is shown in fig 2 gray line 2 2 3 vegetation indices in order to calculate the selected vis table 2 we used the sentinel 2 observations esa sentinel 2a and 2b satellite sensors have provided 13 spectral bands covering visible near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir bands at 10 20 and 60 m spatial resolution since july 2015 with temporal revisit frequency of 5 10 days sentinel 2 sensors incorporate three red edge spectral bands band 5 6 7 specifically designed to monitor the health condition and function of vegetation such observations have been demonstrated to outperform the red edge bands for estimating canopy chlorophyll content and leaf area index frampton et al 2013 we collected 37 sentinel 2 level 1c top of atmosphere reflectance images for the hrb between june and september in 2017 2018 from the esa sentinel scientific data hub https copernicus eu sentinel 2 images were atmospherically corrected using sen2cor https step esa int main third party plugins 2 sen2cor and resampled to 1 km re projected to the same projection as smap l3 sm p e product ease grid 2 0 epsg 6933 and finally used to calculate each individual vi in table 2 in addition for comparison purposes 1 km modis 16 day ndvi mod13a2 https doi org 10 5067 modis mod13a2 006 were also used for vwc estimation since a limited number of cloud free images were available to match the dates of in situ vwc measurements and smap overpasses we applied the savitzky golay filter chen et al 2004 to smooth the vi time series and linearly interpolated the vi time series to produce temporally continuous daily vi datasets 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 vwc estimation here five vis table 2 from sentinel 2 images and ndvi from mod13a2 are applied for vwc estimation over cornfields during the growing season according to the smap approach the vwc is estimated using the following empirical relationship jackson et al 1999 o neill et al 2021a 2 vwc 1 9134 ndvi 2 0 3215 n d v i s f ndvi max

croplands is specified using the current climatological ndvi and ndvi min is set as 0 1 for snow free conditions chan et al 2013 hereinafter the modis climatological ndvi applied in smap sm retrieval algorithms is denoted as mod ndviclim and daily interpolated modis dynamic ndvi based on mod13a2 see section 2 2 3 as mod ndvidyn likewise daily ndvi based on sentinel 2 images resampled to 1 km is denoted as s2 ndvidyn besides vi selection we further examine whether the vwc estimation scheme in eq 2 can be improved by empirical vi vwc relationships established based on vwc observations since both linear and quadratic relationships have been documented between vi and vwc across various crop types jackson et al 1999 cosh et al 2019 judge et al 2021 we focus on these two types of relationships to establish such vi vwc relationships we randomly split the vwc observations into the training 80 sample size and validation 20 sample size sets for the relationship fitting and the optimal vi vwc relationship is selected using the metrics of bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse this procedure is bootstrapped 100 times to take the average as final estimates vwc is estimated based on the above mentioned regressed relationships using the 1 km daily vis described in section 2 2 3 and then averaged to 9 km for vwc validation section 3 1 and sm retrieval section 3 2 2 3 2 sm retrieval algorithms of dca and sca v we used dca and sca v to retrieve sm from smap tb observations both algorithms are based on a well known τ ω model to approximate the radiative transfer process mo et al 1982 the primary equation for this model captures emission from soil and vegetation canopy as 3 tb p modeled t s e p rough exp τ p s e c θ t c 1 ω p 1 exp τ p s e c θ 1 r p rough exp τ p s e c θ where the subscript p is v h polarization t s and t c are the soil and vegetation temperatures e p rough is the rough soil emissivity r p rough is the rough soil reflectivity r p rough 1 e p rough τ p is the nadir vegetation opacity ω p is the vegetation single scattering albedo and θ is the incident angle set equal to 40 for smap l band observations typically t s is assumed equal to t c at 6 00 am local time of the smap satellite overpasses based on this assumption both t s and t c in eq 3 are replaced by the effective surface temperature t eff here we utilized only 6 00 am sm retrievals the parameter τ p is assumed to be linearly related to vwc via an empirical slope parameter b which mainly depends on modis igbp land cover type and vwc is estimated via mod ndviclim using eq 2 in the smap dca and sca v parameter b depends on both the vegetation structure and the microwave frequency however it is set equal for both the h and v polarizations in the smap algorithm in this study the unitless b value for h v polarization is set to 0 11 for cropland o neill et al 2021a 4 τ p b v w c in addition the r p rough is estimated as a function of the smooth soil reflectivity r p

well posed t eff t c ω p q and h are all obtained from ancillary datasets provided within the smap l3 sm p e product section 2 2 2 the parameterizations of ω p q and h within the sca v differ from those within the dca in the following aspects for sca v ω p and h are assumed to vary as a function of the igbp land cover type and q is set equal to zero in contrast for dca q is assumed to be linearly related to h q 0 1771 h lawrence et al 2013 where h is retrieved through the classical dca njoku and li 1999 and therefore has different value from h in sca v in addition dca updates the values of ω p used in the sca v based on several independent sources njoku and li 1999 o neill et al 2021a in sca v only v polarized tb observations are used to estimate sm after correcting for the impact of vegetation temperatures and surface roughness sca v retrieves sm through the fresnel equations and the mironov model mironov et al 2009 from tb observations in dca both h and v polarized tb observations are simultaneously used to retrieve sm and vod τ by minimizing the cost function njoku and li 1999 o neill et al 2021a 6 f tb v obs tb v modeled 2 tb h obs tb h modeled 2 λ 2 τ τ 2 where tb v obs and tb h obs are the v and h polarized brightness temperatures observations from smap tb v modeled and tb h modeled are the modelled brightness temperatures from eq 3 λ is a unitless regularization parameter which was assumed to be 20 to reduce the noise in f and τ is the initial guess for the unknown vegetation optical depth this first guess is given by the τ p value provided by sca see eq 4 2 4 accuracy metrics we measure the accuracy of vwc and sm estimations using metrics including bias root mean square error rmse ubrmse and normalized mutual information nmi mutual information mi cover and thomas 1991 is a nonparametric measure of correlation here defined strictly as the lack of independence between two random variables and represents the amount of entropy uncertainty in either of the two variables that are reduced by knowing the other it is a more rigorous measure compared to the commonly used metrics such as spearman s rank correlation coefficient and pearson correlation coefficient the latter being an approximation of mi under certain conditions nearing and gupta 2015 estimated mi is normalized by the entropy of the corresponding in situ measurements to remove the effect of inter site variation on the magnitude of difference and thus represents the fraction of uncertainty in ground observations that is resolvable given knowledge of the retrievals or simulations nearing et al 2018 in this study we calculate the nmi content for each site for additional details on nmi please see qiu et al 2014 2016 3 results 3 1 vwc estimations from optical vegetation indices six optical vis including red edge vis and non red edge vis are used to establish optimal vi vwc relationships for corn using ground based vwc observations validation statistics for the established optimal vi vwc relationships are summarized in table 3 all the dynamic vis show comparatively high performance in their fitted vi vwc relationships with rmse lower than 2 kg m2 the two red edge vis mcari and ireci show similar performance in vwc estimation likewise the two non red edge vis ndwi1 and ndwi2 also demonstrate comparable accuracy in fitting vwc therefore we respectively select only one vi from each group i e mcari for the red edge vi group and ndwi2 for the non red edge vi group and further assess their impact on vwc estimation uncertainty this assessment is conducted against the vwc estimation based on the smap baseline algorithm using mod ndviclim and the same baseline vwc algorithm using mod ndvidyn and s2 ndvidyn all the vwcs are derived at 1 km spatial resolution and further resampled to 9 km to be consistent with the smap l3 sm p e dataset the temporal dynamics of the five vis and their derived vwcs are shown in fig 2 in fig 2 the peak of in situ vwc in 2017 is lower than that in 2018 which is due to the anomalously hot weather in july 2017 wu et al 2022 this anomalous condition in 2017 has justified the selection of our study period since it offers suitable testbed for evaluating the benefit of using dynamic vi rather than using the climatological vi to estimate vwc all vwc retrievals based on dynamic vis i e ndwi2 mcari and ndvidyn show a similar trend with respect to in situ vwc that is peaking around august at a level above 3 kg m2 in contrast mod ndviclim significantly underestimates vwc during the growing season with a bias of 1 669 kg m2 this underestimation can be attributed to either scale effects associated with resolution differences between modis and sentinel 2 sensors or inter annual differences captured by dynamic vis but neglected in climatological ndvi values colliander et al 2019 the observed difference between mod ndvidyn and s2 ndvidyn table 3 and fig a2 a can be attributed to sensors differences resulting in their different performances for estimating vwc by comparing the vis and the correspondingly derived vwc at 1 km fig a2 with those resampled to 9 km fig 2 we find that the relative changes of vi and vwc due to upscaling are similar therefore the observed underestimation of mod ndviclim derived vwc is likely caused by both sensor differences and the inability of climatological vi to capture inter annual variations in vegetation conditions from statistics sampled across all growing seasons table 3 non red edge vis i e mod ndvidyn s2 ndvidyn ndwi1 and ndwi2 exhibit slightly better vwc estimation accuracy compared to red edge vis i e mcari and ireci however it should be noted that the red edge vis outperform its counterpart of non red edge vis during the peak growth stage of corn fig 2 the non red edge vis are sensitive to water content fluctuations within vegetation canopies which is consistent with previous studies gao et al 2015 cosh et al 2019 on the other hand the red edge vis are relatively more sensitive to lcc compared to water content which might lead to the overestimation of vwc during the early stage of the growing season when lcc increases more rapidly than vwc in terms of the vwc estimation scheme the performance of the empirical vi vwc relationships in table 3 are comparable to the default smap vwc baseline algorithm eq 2 in addition our established vi vwc relationships in table 3 have been further validated using in situ vwc measurements acquired within a more diverse range of hydro climatic regimes table a3 fig a3 1 and fig a3 2 3 2 sm retrievals based on different vwc schemes and retrieval algorithms based on vi derived vwc values discussed in section 3 1 we further investigate their subsequent impact on sm retrievals obtained via dca fig 3 presents the retrieved sm time series based on vwc derived from all four vis at the cornfield sites and the associated sm validation statistics as shown in fig 3 the sm time series derived from ndviclim gray circle is systematically biased low during the entire growing season with this bias equaling about 60 of the mean rmse value 0 074 m3 m3 and about 26 of the observed mean sm 0 175 m3 m3 likewise sm retrievals utilizing dynamic vis ndwi2 mcari and s2 ndvidyn are more accurate than mod ndviclim derived sm denoted as mod ndviclim sm during the entire growing season however the application of dynamic vis in sm retrievals does not significantly increase sm accuracy in terms of ubrmse metrics this suggests that the vi with the best performance in vwc estimation might not be optimal for sm retrievals via current algorithms in the case where other retrieval parameters are not updated these seemingly contradictory conclusions are discussed further in section 4 4 in terms of bias sm retrievals based on three dynamic vis especially for mcari have all mitigated the previously discussed low bias in mod ndviclim sm during the growing season fig 3 as seen in section 3 1 the underestimation of vwc due to ndviclim error has been corrected by using dynamic vis which can more accurately capture surface vegetation conditions compare to climatological vi compared to mod ndviclim vwc the dynamic vis led to a higher vwc which can correctly account for vegetation effects in the τ ω model as seen in fig 3 this includes the correct estimation of vegetation emission and attenuation due to vegetation scattering leading to theoretically more accurate sm retrievals i e wetter sm retrievals than mod ndviclim sm to illustrate the sm spatial patterns derived from the four vis we selected days with the most complete vi and tb observations during the vwc peak of the corn growing season i e august 4 in 2017 for exemplary purposes in fig 4 all sm retrievals show a consistent southeast northwest spatial gradient reflecting heterogeneity in land cover i e the southeast area is mostly oasis and the northwest is adjacent to desert as shown in earlier results i e fig 3 the mod ndviclim sm is significantly drier compared to the other three sm data sets while mcari derived sm shows highest values over the entire study area as mentioned in the previous paragraph the negative bias in mod ndviclim will insufficiently account for vegetation effects which leads to the underestimation of both microwave emission originating from vegetation and vegetative attenuation of soil emission these biases will in turn cause the algorithm to overestimate soil emission and underestimate sm 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of sm retrievals uncertainty to vwc uncertainty based on different vis to reveal how errors in vwc estimates will affect sm retrieval uncertainty we resampled the spatial vwc to the same resolution as smap l3 sm p e product 9 km and calculated the pixel wise relationship between sm and vwc anomalies using the same exemplary date of august 4 as in fig 4 the sm anomaly δsm is obtained by subtracting the mod ndviclim sm values or smap l3 sm p e sm retrievals from each set of sm retrievals based on dynamic vis and the vwc anomaly δvwc is measured using the same method i e subtracting mod ndviclim vwc from each set of vwc estimates based on dynamic vis the δsm is plotted against δvwc and shown in fig 5 when applying red edge vi the sensitivity of δsm to δvwc is higher with slope k 0 036 m2 kg than that when using the non red edge vis of ndwi2 and s2 ndvidyn this could also be attributed to the high sensitivity of red edge vi to lcc confirmed during the peak period of the growing season in section 3 1 the temporal variations in mcari derived vwc incorporates information concerning both vwc and lcc changes in lcc could reflect variations in aboveground biomass and vegetation structure that are not reflected in vwc and therefore result in larger sm variations 4 2 comparison of sm retrievals between dca and sca v to quantify the added benefit of using more accurate vi within different smap algorithms i e sca v and dca we compared the accuracy of sm retrievals based on sca v and dca using both mod ndviclim vwc and s2 ndvidyn vwc estimates the results of these comparisons are shown in table 4 regardless of whether s2 ndvidyn or mod ndviclim is used dca reduces the observed low bias in sca v sm retrievals which is consistent with walker et al 2019 in addition the use of dynamic vis updating mod ndviclim with s2 ndvidyn can improve the accuracy of sm retrievals for both algorithms especially for sca v a key difference between dca and sca v is that in dca mod ndviclim vwc is used as an initial guess in the regularization term of eq 6 to reduce uncertainty in vwc estimates obtained from the inversion of dual polarization tb observations chaubell et al 2022 therefore dca can improve vod estimation and further reduce errors in sm retrievals caused by using mod ndviclim vwc directly as in sca v as a result the difference between mod ndviclim sm and s2 ndvidyn sm in dca s2 ndvidyn sm mod ndviclim sm should be smaller than the comparable difference in sca v this can be confirmed in fig 6 i e the mean improvement brought by updating ndvi in sca v versus that in dca is 19 2 vs 16 5 which is consistent with validation results in table 4 4 3 sensitivity of sm retrievals accuracy to dca parameter λ the unitless regularization parameter λ in dca determines how much freedom the dual polarization optimization inversion is granted to converge to a solution of vod relative to the expected prior value of τ chaubell et al 2022 a λ value of zero means no regularization and vod is estimated without using prior mod ndviclim values in contrast a very high value of λ forces the vod retrieval to approximate the mod ndviclim derived vod corresponding to τ here as in the smap dca the parameter λ is set to a fixed value of 20 see the dashed grey line in fig 7 however this value may not be the optimal choice for all land cover types hence we examine the impact of λ on sm accuracy by varying λ from 0 to 100 with an interval of 5 results are shown in fig 7 which is based on the evaluation of sm using in situ sm measurements when λ is set equal to 20 in the smap dca the temporal noise in vod retrievals has reduced as expected however for our validation results fig 7 shows that the optimal value of λ corresponding to the minimized rmse and maximized nmi varies between different sites when compared to a λ of zero i e retrieval without regularization sm retrievals show lowest rmse approximately 11 of reduction in sm retrieval error when λ is around 30 fig 7a and c in addition compared with the empirical value of λ 20 applied in the official smap dca setting λ to 30 results in a slight improvement in sm retrievals this justifies a more detailed parameterization scheme that considers land use type when defining λ 4 4 sensitivity of sm retrievals accuracy to surface roughness coefficient h surface roughness is a critical factor for l band sm retrieval zeng et al 2016 wigneron et al 2017 to generate the static roughness coefficient h used in the current dca 5 year 2015 04 01 2020 03 31 smap tb observations and mod ndviclim derived vwc is first used for the estimation of h using the classic dca without regularization term following chaubell et al 2020 and o neill et al 2021a 7 f h s m h tb v obs s m h tb v modeled 2 tb h obs s m h tb h modeled 2 this step generates a time series of h i j k for each 9 km grid cell i j at the time index k and similarly τ i j k is the time series of the associated τ from mod ndviclim derived vwc defining τ min i j m i n τ i j k f o r a l l k and τ max i j m a x τ i j k f o r a l l k pixel wise h coefficient is calculated as follows to minimize the vegetation impact 8 h i j a v e r a g e h i j k τ i j k τ min i j 0 05 τ max i j τ min i j in the above baseline approach the mod ndviclim derived vwc is used for estimating the time series of h from f h and minimizing the vegetation impact on h however the application of mod ndviclim derived vwc in h estimation could hinder the previously evidenced improvement of sm accuracy associated with the use of dynamic vi in vwc estimation as it cannot capture the interannual variation of surface roughness therefore in this section by replacing climatological vwc with dynamical vwc for f h estimation in eq 7 we updated the static h value with h value estimated using time varying vwc derived from s2 ndvidyn described in section 3 1 and investigated the influence of both roughness and vwc on sm retrievals all results are shown in table 5 the estimated h show general higher values of 0 2 26 compared with the static h value 0 1 5 provided in the smap ancillary dataset based on the updated dynamic vwc and h the accuracy of sm retrievals can be significantly improved at all three of our in situ sm sites table 5 this also explains why when not taking surface roughness into account the optimal vi selection based on vwc accuracy is slightly different from the optimal vi based on sm accuracy section 3 2 in addition we should note that the uncertainty of sm retrievals could be attributed to the spatial mismatch between point scale in situ sm measurements and footprint scale smap observations at 9 km resolution due to the mixed pixel effect at coarse spatial resolution chen et al 2018a b in addition to the vegetation impacts on sm retrievals investigated in this study the underestimation of surface temperature used in dca might lead to underestimation of sm chen et al 2018a b fan et al 2020 besides when updating the soil texture used in sm retrieval algorithm from the composite soil attribute dataset to soilgrids250m dataset the clay fraction is reported to have a second order impact on sm retrievals with a difference of 0 02 m3 m3 at the very wet condition in soils with very high clay fraction o neill et al 2021a all the above mentioned uncertainties worth further investigation in the future for improving the smap sm products 5 conclusions here we applied five different vis i e ndvidyn ndwi1 ndwi2 mcari and ireci derived from sentinel 2 for vwc estimation and investigated how these vwc estimates affect sm retrieval accuracy for the smap baseline dca we also investigated the impact of different vis on sm retrievals from dca and sca v and the influence of the regularization parameter λ and surface roughness coefficient h applied in dca comparison of the vwc estimates from five selected vis and mod ndviclim against the in situ vwc measurements revealed a low bias in vwc retrievals based on mod ndviclim within the growing season in our study area the use of mod ndviclim in smap underestimated both vwc and retrieved sm due to the neglect of inter annual differences in vegetation conditions in mod ndviclim as a result the application of time varying vis from sentinel 2 slightly improves the accuracy of sm retrievals through a detailed investigation of the relationship between the vwc derived from dynamic vis and their associated sm retrieval accuracy we found that sm uncertainty is more sensitive to vwc uncertainty when using red edge vis compared to its counterpart when using non red edge vis in addition the influence of vegetation quantified by vwc in sm retrievals was larger for sca v than for dca over croplands during the growing season by adjusting the regularization parameter λ used in dca we found that the optimal value of λ varied across different sites such that a single optimized value of λ could not be defined in addition the update of vwc alone is much less efficient than the simultaneous update of vwc and surface roughness together overall this study provides a method for accurately estimating vwc using dynamic vis from sentinel 2 which improves upon dca based sm retrievals in an agricultural area during the growing season presented results also improve our understanding of vwc impacts on sm retrievals for both dca and sca v for future studies we proposed to utilize sentinel 2 dynamic vi to retrieve sm using dca in agricultural regions instead of modis climatological ndvi as well as adjusting λ values based on land cover types to obtain more accurate sm retrievals in addition future research should focus on the simultaneous update of both vwc and vwc related surface roughness coefficient we expect these steps to provide clear benefits for the smap sm retrieval algorithm and a more effective method to account for vegetation effects across major agricultural regions credit authorship contribution statement sijia feng data curation

of vi and their corresponding vwc retrievals at 1 km resolution at daman site during growing season in 2017 2018 all the dynamic vi derived vwcs show similar trends with in situ vwc measurement in contrast the mod ndviclim exhibits different peaks compare to ndvidyn fig a2 a resulting in the poor performance in vwc estimation which is consistent with results in section 3 1 compared to vis from modis both mod ndviclim and mod ndvidyn the vis from sentinel 2 capture larger magnitude of fluctuation as shown in fig a2 a above all mod ndviclim cannot accurately capture current inter annual changes of vegetation and our result in section 3 1 is proven reliable appendix a3 we use the in situ vwc measurements collected at corn sites in a temperate monsoon zone which has different hydro climatological conditions than our study area to further validate the vi vwc relationship established in table 3 at the daman site table a3 summarizes the information on these additional in situ vwc

fig a3 1 and vwc measurements collected during 2018 jinzhou site in table a3 are used to validate vi vwc relationship based on sentinel 2 data fig a3 2 overall our pre established vi vwc relationships

2273,satellite based soil moisture sm retrieval within agricultural regions is challenging due to pronounced vegetation and land cover variations during the growing season vegetation water content vwc used to describe vegetation opacity in both the soil moisture active passive smap dual channel algorithm dca and v polarization single channel algorithm sca v is approximated using a climatological normalized difference vegetation index ndvi time series to understand the impact of vwc algorithms on smap sm retrievals we investigated optimal vegetation indices for vwc estimation and further evaluated the impact of vwc uncertainty on dca and sca v sm retrievals besides ndvi we applied four dynamic vegetation indices vis acquired from sentinel 2 including two red edge vis modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index mcari and inverted red edge chlorophyll index ireci and two non red edge vis normalized difference water index ndwi1 and ndwi2 to estimate growing season corn vwc and the impact of different empirical relationships on vwc estimates we find that climatological ndvi from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis significantly underestimates vwc and therefore underestimates sm over croplands in northwest china during the growing season whereas dynamic vis can improve the accuracy of vwc and sm retrievals with respect to the choice of vi for vwc estimation mcari is more accurate during the peak growing season compared to its counterpart non red edge vis however it also overestimates vwc during the early growing stage in addition the influence of vwc uncertainty on sm accuracy is shown to be higher in sca v than in dca the results of this study provide insight into preferred approaches for the accurate estimation of vwc and associated improvement in passive microwave algorithms for sm retrieval keywords vegetation water content soil moisture retrieval smap sentinel 2 dca sca v data availability data will be made available upon request 1 introduction as a water reservoir for natural and managed ecosystems soil moisture sm plays a vital role in modulating water and energy exchange across the soil plant atmosphere continuum jung et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2010 specifically sm exerts significant controls on water partitioning from precipitation into evapotranspiration wetzel and jy tai 1987 detto et al 2006 zhou et al 2021 runoff and groundwater akbar et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 currently l band 1 2 1 4 ghz microwave radiometry provides an all sky capability for global surface sm monitoring at a frequency of 2 3

passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 missions at l band the upward soil emission from the topmost 5 cm and its interactions with vegetation canopy layers are typically simulated using a zeroth order radiative transfer model i e the well known τ ω model mo et al 1982 however due to limited satellite observations and collinearity between vertically v and horizontally h polarized brightness temperatures tb observations the inversion of the τ ω model is often underdetermined especially for the smap mission which provides h and v polarization information at only a single incidence angle of 40 konings et al 2015 gao et al 2020c several inversion algorithms for producing sm products have been developed wigneron et al 2017 gao et al 2020b 2021 li et al 2022a 2022b among them the single channel algorithm based on vertical polarization sca v and the dual channel algorithm dca are the baseline algorithms used to generate official smap sm products o neill et al 2021a previous studies have suggested that the uncertainty of sm products from sca v and dca is marginally less than other algorithms products gao et al 2021 in both algorithms the required parameter for canopy opacity is the vegetation optical depth vod which is estimated differently in the sca v and dca in the sca v a climatological vod value is estimated from vegetation water content vwc based on its empirical relationship with vegetation indices vis jackson et al 1999 the vi for estimating vwc in smap sm retrieval algorithms is the climatological normalized difference vegetation index ndvi obtained from averaging multi year moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis chan et al 2013 radiance measurements in contrast to sca v dca utilizes both h and v polarization information to estimate vod and adds a regularization term to reduce spatial and temporal noise associated with the dual polarization inversion problem o neill et al 2021a this regularization term is based on a prior climatological value of vod obtained using in the sca v i e based on a climatological ndvi the vod climatology used in both smap sm retrieval algorithms is constructed using 10 years 2000 2010 of 10 day modis ndvi composites chan et al 2013 three steps are required to estimate vod climatology from ndvi first vwc is obtained from ndvi using an empirical equation constructed by the ground based vwc measurements across a variety of vegetation types jackson et al 1999 second vod is estimated from vwc using an empirical linear equation based on different land cover types jackson and schmugge 1991 o neill et al 2021a finally 10 day vod climatology is produced from modis ndvi climatology composites based on the relationship established in the previous two steps since this static ndvi climatology cannot capture reported phenological shifts associated with global warming or the impact of inter annual vegetation variations due to drought and fluvial conditions colliander et al 2019 fan et al 2020 gao et al 2020a shen et al 2022 the direct use of ndvi derived vod climatology in sm retrieval algorithms can lead to reduced sm accuracy judge et al 2021 this raises two questions 1 can dynamic vis be used to obtain vwc and vod estimates that significantly improve sm retrievals relative to the current smap approach of utilizing an ndvi climatology to estimate vwc and vod and 2 are alternative vis superior to modis based ndvi for vod estimates utilized by smap sm retrievals this second question is made more relevant by the advanced age of the modis sensors onboard the nasa terra and aqua satellites which have both been in service for almost twenty years terra launched in 1999 aqua launched in 2002 to answer these two questions we will test multiple vis acquired from sentinel

et al 2000 and two non red edge vis normalized difference water index ndwi1 and ndwi2 the red edge vis are selected due to their high sensitivity to leaf chlorophyll content lcc and their value for monitoring vegetation health and functioning frampton et al 2013 dong et al 2020 between the two red edge vis mcari is highly sensitive to background reflectance properties daughtry et al 2000 and ireci is less affected by red band reflectance and thus less likely to saturate frampton et al 2013 note that there is an emerging discussion regarding the use of microwave based vis for sm retrieval wang et al 2021 whereas it falls outside the scope of this study the organization of this work is as follows the details of the study area are described in section 2 1 section 2 2 introduces the datasets used for vwc estimation and sm retrieval i e in situ measurements of sm and vwc the smap sm product and ancillary datasets for retrieving sm and four vis introduced above our methodology including various vwc estimation schemes and the smap dca and sca v are discussed in section 2 3 in section 3 we apply the vwc estimates to retrieve sm in the dca and investigate the impact of diverse vis on the quality of sm retrievals in section 4 we provide insights into sm retrieval uncertainty associated with vwc errors based on red edge and non red edge vis in dca and compare the sensitivity of sca v and dca sm retrievals to errors in vwc our conclusions are then summarized in section 5 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area our study area is the heihe river basin hrb fig 1 it is the second largest endorheic basin in the arid and semiarid region of northwestern china and features a temperate continental arid climate the annual precipitation of hrb ranges between 100 and 250 mm with over 60 concentrated between june and september mean annual potential evapotranspiration in hrb is approximately 1200 1800 mm li et al 2013 a major agriculture region is located in the middle reach of hrb fig 1 where the main crop is corn zea mays l xu et al 2019 with planting time in mid april in recent years with the extension of corn planting area hrb has become an increasingly important corn producing area in china tan and zheng 2017 in this study we focus on vwc estimation and sm retrieval over cornfield which is the prevailing crop type in our study area and has high water demand during the growing season 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 in situ measurements of vwc and sm the vwc measurements were collected from 3 sample sites located in the relatively homogeneous corn growing areas within the middle reach of hrb geng and che 2021a 2021b the in situ vwc dataset is provided by the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn for each site the vwc sampling was conducted during the growing season may to september of 2017 2018 the sampling interval is five days except during the end of corn growth stage around september table a1 for crops the vwc kg m2 was calculated by fresh weight w fresh kg dry weight w dry kg plant spacing x m row spacing y m and plants number n as 1 vwc w fresh w dry x y n in addition to be consistent with regional spatial resolution of 1 km modis ndvi three adjacent vwc sample sites within a single 1 km pixel were averaged to represent a single site labeled as daman in fig 1 and therefore a single time series for the establishment of the vi vwc empirical relationship based on sentinel 2 ndvi values we removed the in situ vwc samples with corresponding ndvi 0 1 and obtained 39 effective in situ vwc samples during the 2017 2018 growing seasons besides we have collected in situ vwc measurements from humid and semi humid regions for supplementary validation of vi vwc relationships established at this site daman in 2017 2018 in situ sm measurements are provided by a national network of chinese automatic soil moisture observation stations casmos han et al 2017 there are three casmos sites with corn cover in our study area fig 1 at each casmos site frequency domain reflectometry based instruments were used to record hourly volumetric soil moisture content at soil depths between 0 and 50 cm with a 10 cm vertical interval these hourly soil moisture observations were then aggregated into daily values for each layer daily values with less than five hourly soil moisture measurements were excluded since the sm retrievals from l band microwave are within 5 cm of the surface we selected the in situ sm measurement acquired at depth of 10 cm for evaluation qiu et al 2021 for each casmos site we removed the abnormal sm values based on precipitation observations from automatic weather stations nearby the removed abnormal sm values occurred mostly at site 52652 between june 25 and august 5 in 2018 the details of each casmos site are shown in table 1 2 2 2 smap l3 product the smap mission was launched in 2015 and has been providing scientific data ever since the primary objective of smap is to produce a global mapping of high resolution sm every 2 3 days in this study the daily sm baseline retrievals were provided by smap enhanced l3 radiometer global daily 9 km ease grid sm product l3 sm p e version 5 o neill et al 2021b here both h v polarized tb and sm retrievals based on the sca v and dca algorithms from descending orbit 6 00 am local solar time were used since october 2021 dca has been the current baseline algorithm for all official smap l2 3 radiometer based sm products prior to that the official one was sca v nevertheless smap sm retrieval products based on both algorithms are currently being released to the public required ancillary datasets for smap sm retrievals including effective surface temperature t eff soil texture and surface roughness coefficient h were collected from the smap l3 sm p e product for examination of the sca v and dca in addition 9 km vwc values were extracted from the smap l3 sm p e product its time series at the in situ vwc site is shown in fig 2 gray line 2 2 3 vegetation indices in order to calculate the selected vis table 2 we used the sentinel 2 observations esa sentinel 2a and 2b satellite sensors have provided 13 spectral bands covering visible near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir bands at 10 20 and 60 m spatial resolution since july 2015 with temporal revisit frequency of 5 10 days sentinel 2 sensors incorporate three red edge spectral bands band 5 6 7 specifically designed to monitor the health condition and function of vegetation such observations have been demonstrated to outperform the red edge bands for estimating canopy chlorophyll content and leaf area index frampton et al 2013 we collected 37 sentinel 2 level 1c top of atmosphere reflectance images for the hrb between june and september in 2017 2018 from the esa sentinel scientific data hub https copernicus eu sentinel 2 images were atmospherically corrected using sen2cor https step esa int main third party plugins 2 sen2cor and resampled to 1 km re projected to the same projection as smap l3 sm p e product ease grid 2 0 epsg 6933 and finally used to calculate each individual vi in table 2 in addition for comparison purposes 1 km modis 16 day ndvi mod13a2 https doi org 10 5067 modis mod13a2 006 were also used for vwc estimation since a limited number of cloud free images were available to match the dates of in situ vwc measurements and smap overpasses we applied the savitzky golay filter chen et al 2004 to smooth the vi time series and linearly interpolated the vi time series to produce temporally continuous daily vi datasets 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 vwc estimation here five vis table 2 from sentinel 2 images and ndvi from mod13a2 are applied for vwc estimation over cornfields during the growing season according to the smap approach the vwc is estimated using the following empirical relationship jackson et al 1999 o neill et al 2021a 2 vwc 1 9134 ndvi 2 0 3215 n d v i s f ndvi max ndvi min 1 ndvi min where the stem factor sf is set as 3 5 for cropland and the land use type is determined using modis land cover types dataset mcd12q1 version 6 https doi org 10 5067 modis mcd12q1

reproduced based on 16 day 1 km modis ndvi composites acquire during 2000 2010 mod13a2 version 5 ndvi max and ndvi min are annual maximum and minimum ndvi values for a particular pixel ndvi max for croplands is specified using the current climatological ndvi and ndvi min is set as 0 1 for snow free conditions chan et al 2013 hereinafter the modis climatological ndvi applied in smap sm retrieval algorithms is denoted as mod ndviclim and daily interpolated modis dynamic ndvi based on mod13a2 see section 2 2 3 as mod ndvidyn likewise daily ndvi based on sentinel 2 images resampled to 1 km is denoted as s2 ndvidyn besides vi selection we further examine whether the vwc estimation scheme in eq 2 can be improved by empirical vi vwc relationships established based on vwc observations since both linear and quadratic relationships have been documented between vi and vwc across various crop types jackson et al 1999 cosh et al 2019 judge et al 2021 we focus on these two types of relationships to establish such vi vwc relationships we randomly split the vwc observations into the training 80 sample size and validation 20 sample size sets for the relationship fitting and the optimal vi vwc relationship is selected using the metrics of bias and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse this procedure is bootstrapped 100 times to take the average as final estimates vwc is estimated based on the above mentioned regressed relationships using the 1 km daily vis described in section 2 2 3 and then averaged to 9 km for vwc validation section 3 1 and sm retrieval section 3 2 2 3 2 sm retrieval algorithms of dca and sca v we used dca and sca v to retrieve sm from smap tb observations both algorithms are based on a well known τ ω model to approximate the radiative transfer process mo et al 1982 the primary equation for this model captures emission from soil and vegetation canopy as 3 tb p modeled t s e p rough exp τ p s e c θ t c 1 ω p 1 exp τ p s e c θ 1 r p rough exp τ p s e c θ where the subscript p is v h polarization t s and t c are the soil and vegetation temperatures e p rough is the rough soil emissivity r p rough is the rough soil reflectivity r p rough 1 e p rough τ p is the nadir vegetation opacity ω p is the vegetation single scattering albedo and θ is the incident angle set equal to 40 for smap l band observations typically t s is assumed equal to t c at 6 00 am local time of the smap satellite overpasses based on this assumption both t s and t c in eq 3 are replaced by the effective surface temperature t eff here we utilized only 6 00 am sm retrievals the parameter τ p is assumed to be linearly related to vwc via an empirical slope parameter b which mainly depends on modis igbp land cover type and vwc is estimated via mod ndviclim using eq 2 in the smap dca and sca v parameter b depends on both the vegetation structure and the microwave frequency however it is set equal for both the h and v polarizations in the smap algorithm in this study the unitless b value for h v polarization is set to 0 11 for cropland o neill et al 2021a 4 τ p b v w c in addition the r p rough is estimated as a function of the smooth soil reflectivity r p smooth surface roughness coefficient h polarization mixing factor q and θ following wang and choudhury 1981 5 r p rough q r p smooth 1 q r p smooth exp h cos 2 θ next r p rough is linked to the dielectric constant using the fresnel equations and the dielectric constant is further used to estimate sm based on the mironov dielectric mixing model mironov et al 2009 to make the retrieval process well posed t eff t c ω p q and h are all obtained from ancillary datasets provided within the smap l3 sm p e product section 2 2 2 the parameterizations of ω p q and h within the sca v differ from those within the dca in the following aspects for sca v ω p and h are assumed to vary as a function of the igbp land cover type and q is set equal to zero in contrast for dca q is assumed to be linearly related to h q 0 1771 h lawrence et al 2013 where h is retrieved through the classical dca njoku and li 1999 and therefore has different value from h in sca v in addition dca updates the values of ω p used in the sca v based on several independent sources njoku and li 1999 o neill et al 2021a in sca v only v polarized tb observations are used to estimate sm after correcting for the impact of vegetation temperatures and surface roughness sca v retrieves sm through the fresnel equations and the mironov model mironov et al 2009 from tb observations in dca both h and v polarized tb observations are simultaneously used to retrieve sm and vod τ by minimizing the cost function njoku and li 1999 o neill et al 2021a 6 f tb v obs tb v modeled 2 tb h obs tb h modeled 2 λ 2 τ τ 2 where tb v obs and tb h obs are the v and h polarized brightness temperatures observations from smap tb v modeled and tb h modeled are the modelled brightness temperatures from eq 3 λ is a unitless regularization parameter which was assumed to be 20 to reduce the noise in f and τ is the initial guess for the unknown vegetation optical depth this first guess is given by the τ p value provided by sca see eq 4 2 4 accuracy metrics we measure the accuracy of vwc and sm estimations using metrics including bias root mean square error rmse ubrmse and normalized mutual information nmi mutual information mi cover and thomas 1991 is a nonparametric measure of correlation here defined strictly as the lack of independence between two random variables and represents the amount of entropy uncertainty in either of the two variables that are reduced by knowing the other it is a more rigorous measure compared to the commonly used metrics such as spearman s rank correlation coefficient and pearson correlation coefficient the latter being an approximation of mi under certain conditions nearing and gupta 2015 estimated mi is normalized by the entropy of the corresponding in situ measurements to remove the effect of inter site variation on the magnitude of difference and thus represents the fraction of uncertainty in ground observations that is resolvable given knowledge of the retrievals or simulations nearing et al 2018 in this study we calculate the nmi content for each site for additional details on nmi please see qiu et al 2014 2016 3 results 3 1 vwc estimations from optical vegetation indices six optical vis including red edge vis and non red edge vis are used to establish optimal vi vwc relationships for corn using ground based vwc observations validation statistics for the established optimal vi vwc relationships are summarized in table 3 all the dynamic vis show comparatively high performance in their fitted vi vwc relationships with rmse lower than 2 kg m2 the two red edge vis mcari and ireci show similar performance in vwc estimation likewise the two non red edge vis ndwi1 and ndwi2 also demonstrate comparable accuracy in fitting vwc therefore we respectively select only one vi from each group i e mcari for the red edge vi group and ndwi2 for the non red edge vi group and further assess their impact on vwc estimation uncertainty this assessment is conducted against the vwc estimation based on the smap baseline algorithm using mod ndviclim and the same baseline vwc algorithm using mod ndvidyn and s2 ndvidyn all the vwcs are derived at 1 km spatial resolution and further resampled to 9 km to be consistent with the smap l3 sm p e dataset the temporal dynamics of the five vis and their derived vwcs are shown in fig 2 in fig 2 the peak of in situ vwc in 2017 is lower than that in 2018 which is due to the anomalously hot weather in july 2017 wu et al 2022 this anomalous condition in 2017 has justified the selection of our study period since it offers suitable testbed for evaluating the benefit of using dynamic vi rather than using the climatological vi to estimate vwc all vwc retrievals based on dynamic vis i e ndwi2 mcari and ndvidyn show a similar trend with respect to in situ vwc that is peaking around august at a level above 3 kg m2 in contrast mod ndviclim significantly underestimates vwc during the growing season with a bias of 1 669 kg m2 this underestimation can be attributed to either scale effects associated with resolution differences between modis and sentinel 2 sensors or inter annual differences captured by dynamic vis but neglected in climatological ndvi values colliander et al 2019 the observed difference between mod ndvidyn and s2 ndvidyn table 3 and fig a2 a can be attributed to sensors differences resulting in their different performances for estimating vwc by comparing the vis and the correspondingly derived vwc at 1 km fig a2 with those resampled to 9 km fig 2 we find that the relative changes of vi and vwc due to upscaling are similar therefore the observed underestimation of mod ndviclim derived vwc is likely caused by both sensor differences and the inability of climatological vi to capture inter annual variations in vegetation conditions from statistics sampled across all growing seasons table 3 non red edge vis i e mod ndvidyn s2 ndvidyn ndwi1 and ndwi2 exhibit slightly better vwc estimation accuracy compared to red edge vis i e mcari and ireci however it should be noted that the red edge vis outperform its counterpart of non red edge vis during the peak growth stage of corn fig 2 the non red edge vis are sensitive to water content fluctuations within vegetation canopies which is consistent with previous studies gao et al 2015 cosh et al 2019 on the other hand the red edge vis are relatively more sensitive to lcc compared to water content which might lead to the overestimation of vwc during the early stage of the growing season when lcc increases more rapidly than vwc in terms of the vwc estimation scheme the performance of the empirical vi vwc relationships in table 3 are comparable to the default smap vwc baseline algorithm eq 2 in addition our established vi vwc relationships in table 3 have been further validated using in situ vwc measurements acquired within a more diverse range of hydro climatic regimes table a3 fig a3 1 and fig a3 2 3 2 sm retrievals based on different vwc schemes and retrieval algorithms based on vi derived vwc values discussed in section 3 1 we further investigate their subsequent impact on sm retrievals obtained via dca fig 3 presents the retrieved sm time series based on vwc derived from all four vis at the cornfield sites and the associated sm validation statistics as shown in fig 3 the sm time series derived from ndviclim gray circle is systematically biased low during the entire growing season with this bias equaling about 60 of the mean rmse value 0 074 m3 m3 and about 26 of the observed mean sm 0 175 m3 m3 likewise sm retrievals utilizing dynamic vis ndwi2 mcari and s2 ndvidyn are more accurate than mod ndviclim derived sm denoted as mod ndviclim sm during the entire growing season however the application of dynamic vis in sm retrievals does not significantly increase sm accuracy in terms of ubrmse metrics this suggests that the vi with the best performance in vwc estimation might not be optimal for sm retrievals via current algorithms in the case where other retrieval parameters are not updated these seemingly contradictory conclusions are discussed further in section 4 4 in terms of bias sm retrievals based on three dynamic vis especially for mcari have all mitigated the previously discussed low bias in mod ndviclim sm during the growing season fig 3 as seen in section 3 1 the underestimation of vwc due to ndviclim error has been corrected by using dynamic vis which can more accurately capture surface vegetation conditions compare to climatological vi compared to mod ndviclim vwc the dynamic vis led to a higher vwc which can correctly account for vegetation effects in the τ ω model as seen in fig 3 this includes the correct estimation of vegetation emission and attenuation due to vegetation scattering leading to theoretically more accurate sm retrievals i e wetter sm retrievals than mod ndviclim sm to illustrate the sm spatial patterns derived from the four vis we selected days with the most complete vi and tb observations during the vwc peak of the corn growing season i e august 4 in 2017 for exemplary purposes in fig 4 all sm retrievals show a consistent southeast northwest spatial gradient reflecting heterogeneity in land cover i e the southeast area is mostly oasis and the northwest is adjacent to desert as shown in earlier results i e fig 3 the mod ndviclim sm is significantly drier compared to the other three sm data sets while mcari derived sm shows highest values over the entire study area as mentioned in the previous paragraph the negative bias in mod ndviclim will insufficiently account for vegetation effects which leads to the underestimation of both microwave emission originating from vegetation and vegetative attenuation of soil emission these biases will in turn cause the algorithm to overestimate soil emission and underestimate sm 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of sm retrievals uncertainty to vwc uncertainty based on different vis to reveal how errors in vwc estimates will affect sm retrieval uncertainty we resampled the spatial vwc to the same resolution as smap l3 sm p e product 9 km and calculated the pixel wise relationship between sm and vwc anomalies using the same exemplary date of august 4 as in fig 4 the sm anomaly δsm is obtained by subtracting the mod ndviclim sm values or smap l3 sm p e sm retrievals from each set of sm retrievals based on dynamic vis and the vwc anomaly δvwc is measured using the same method i e subtracting mod ndviclim vwc from each set of vwc estimates based on dynamic vis the δsm is plotted against δvwc and shown in fig 5 when applying red edge vi the sensitivity of δsm to δvwc is higher with slope k 0 036 m2 kg than that when using the non red edge vis of ndwi2 and s2 ndvidyn this could also be attributed to the high sensitivity of red edge vi to lcc confirmed during the peak period of the growing season in section 3 1 the temporal variations in mcari derived vwc incorporates information concerning both vwc and lcc changes in lcc could reflect variations in aboveground biomass and vegetation structure that are not reflected in vwc and therefore result in larger sm variations 4 2 comparison of sm retrievals between dca and sca v to quantify the added benefit of using more accurate vi within different smap algorithms i e sca v and dca we compared the accuracy of sm retrievals based on sca v and dca using both mod ndviclim vwc and s2 ndvidyn vwc estimates the results of these comparisons are shown in table 4 regardless of whether s2 ndvidyn or mod ndviclim is used dca reduces the observed low bias in sca v sm retrievals which is consistent with walker et al 2019 in addition the use of dynamic vis updating mod ndviclim with s2 ndvidyn can improve the accuracy of sm retrievals for both algorithms especially for sca v a key difference between dca and sca v is that in dca mod ndviclim vwc is used as an initial guess in the regularization term of eq 6 to reduce uncertainty in vwc estimates obtained from the inversion of dual polarization tb observations chaubell et al 2022 therefore dca can improve vod estimation and further reduce errors in sm retrievals caused by using mod ndviclim vwc directly as in sca v as a result the difference between mod ndviclim sm and s2 ndvidyn sm in dca s2 ndvidyn sm mod ndviclim sm should be smaller than the comparable difference in sca v this can be confirmed in fig 6 i e the mean improvement brought by updating ndvi in sca v versus that in dca is 19 2 vs 16 5 which is consistent with validation results in table 4 4 3 sensitivity of sm retrievals accuracy to dca parameter λ the unitless regularization parameter λ in dca determines how much freedom the dual polarization optimization inversion is granted to converge to a solution of vod relative to the expected prior value of τ chaubell et al 2022 a λ value of zero means no regularization and vod is estimated without using prior mod ndviclim values in contrast a very high value of λ forces the vod retrieval to approximate the mod ndviclim derived vod corresponding to τ here as in the smap dca the parameter λ is set to a fixed value of 20 see the dashed grey line in fig 7 however this value may not be the optimal choice for all land cover types hence we examine the impact of λ on sm accuracy by varying λ from 0 to 100 with an interval of 5 results are shown in fig 7 which is based on the evaluation of sm using in situ sm measurements when λ is set equal to 20 in the smap dca the temporal noise in vod retrievals has reduced as expected however for our validation results fig 7 shows that the optimal value of λ corresponding to the minimized rmse and maximized nmi varies between different sites when compared to a λ of zero i e retrieval without regularization sm retrievals show lowest rmse approximately 11 of reduction in sm retrieval error when λ is around 30 fig 7a and c in addition compared with the empirical value of λ 20 applied in the official smap dca setting λ to 30 results in a slight improvement in sm retrievals this justifies a more detailed parameterization scheme that considers land use type when defining λ 4 4 sensitivity of sm retrievals accuracy to surface roughness coefficient h surface roughness is a critical factor for l band sm retrieval zeng et al 2016 wigneron et al 2017 to generate the static roughness coefficient h used in the current dca 5 year 2015 04 01 2020 03 31 smap tb observations and mod ndviclim derived vwc is first used for the estimation of h using the classic dca without regularization term following chaubell et al 2020 and o neill et al 2021a 7 f h s m h tb v obs s m h tb v modeled 2 tb h obs s m h tb h modeled 2 this step generates a time series of h i j k for each 9 km grid cell i j at the time index k and similarly τ i j k is the time series of the associated τ from mod ndviclim derived vwc defining τ min i j m i n τ i j k f o r a l l k and τ max i j m a x τ i j k f o r a l l k pixel wise h coefficient is calculated as follows to minimize the vegetation impact 8 h i j a v e r a g e h i j k τ i j k τ min i j 0 05 τ max i j τ min i j in the above baseline approach the mod ndviclim derived vwc is used for estimating the time series of h from f h and minimizing the vegetation impact on h however the application of mod ndviclim derived vwc in h estimation could hinder the previously evidenced improvement of sm accuracy associated with the use of dynamic vi in vwc estimation as it cannot capture the interannual variation of surface roughness therefore in this section by replacing climatological vwc with dynamical vwc for f h estimation in eq 7 we updated the static h value with h value estimated using time varying vwc derived from s2 ndvidyn described in section 3 1 and investigated the influence of both roughness and vwc on sm retrievals all results are shown in table 5 the estimated h show general higher values of 0 2 26 compared with the static h value 0 1 5 provided in the smap ancillary dataset based on the updated dynamic vwc and h the accuracy of sm retrievals can be significantly improved at all three of our in situ sm sites table 5 this also explains why when not taking surface roughness into account the optimal vi selection based on vwc accuracy is slightly different from the optimal vi based on sm accuracy section 3 2 in addition we should note that the uncertainty of sm retrievals could be attributed to the spatial mismatch between point scale in situ sm measurements and footprint scale smap observations at 9 km resolution due to the mixed pixel effect at coarse spatial resolution chen et al 2018a b in addition to the vegetation impacts on sm retrievals investigated in this study the underestimation of surface temperature used in dca might lead to underestimation of sm chen et al 2018a b fan et al 2020 besides when updating the soil texture used in sm retrieval algorithm from the composite soil attribute dataset to soilgrids250m dataset the clay fraction is reported to have a second order impact on sm retrievals with a difference of 0 02 m3 m3 at the very wet condition in soils with very high clay fraction o neill et al 2021a all the above mentioned uncertainties worth further investigation in the future for improving the smap sm products 5 conclusions here we applied five different vis i e ndvidyn ndwi1 ndwi2 mcari and ireci derived from sentinel 2 for vwc estimation and investigated how these vwc estimates affect sm retrieval accuracy for the smap baseline dca we also investigated the impact of different vis on sm retrievals from dca and sca v and the influence of the regularization parameter λ and surface roughness coefficient h applied in dca comparison of the vwc estimates from five selected vis and mod ndviclim against the in situ vwc measurements revealed a low bias in vwc retrievals based on mod ndviclim within the growing season in our study area the use of mod ndviclim in smap underestimated both vwc and retrieved sm due to the neglect of inter annual differences in vegetation conditions in mod ndviclim as a result the application of time varying vis from sentinel 2 slightly improves the accuracy of sm retrievals through a detailed investigation of the relationship between the vwc derived from dynamic vis and their associated sm retrieval accuracy we found that sm uncertainty is more sensitive to vwc uncertainty when using red edge vis compared to its counterpart when using non red edge vis in addition the influence of vegetation quantified by vwc in sm retrievals was larger for sca v than for dca over croplands during the growing season by adjusting the regularization parameter λ used in dca we found that the optimal value of λ varied across different sites such that a single optimized value of λ could not be defined in addition the update of vwc alone is much less efficient than the simultaneous update of vwc and surface roughness together overall this study provides a method for accurately estimating vwc using dynamic vis from sentinel 2 which improves upon dca based sm retrievals in an agricultural area during the growing season presented results also improve our understanding of vwc impacts on sm retrievals for both dca and sca v for future studies we proposed to utilize sentinel 2 dynamic vi to retrieve sm using dca in agricultural regions instead of modis climatological ndvi as well as adjusting λ values based on land cover types to obtain more accurate sm retrievals in addition future research should focus on the simultaneous update of both vwc and vwc related surface roughness coefficient we expect these steps to provide clear benefits for the smap sm retrieval algorithm and a more effective method to account for vegetation effects across major agricultural regions credit authorship contribution statement sijia feng data curation

of vi and their corresponding vwc retrievals at 1 km resolution at daman site during growing season in 2017 2018 all the dynamic vi derived vwcs show similar trends with in situ vwc measurement in contrast the mod ndviclim exhibits different peaks compare to ndvidyn fig a2 a resulting in the poor performance in vwc estimation which is consistent with results in section 3 1 compared to vis from modis both mod ndviclim and mod ndvidyn the vis from sentinel 2 capture larger magnitude of fluctuation as shown in fig a2 a above all mod ndviclim cannot accurately capture current inter annual changes of vegetation and our result in section 3 1 is proven reliable appendix a3 we use the in situ vwc measurements collected at corn sites in a temperate monsoon zone which has different hydro

on request 1 introduction groundwater is the preferred source of freshwater in ever increasing urbanization industrialization and rapid expansion of arable land due to the interrupted supply of surface water which is dependent on timely monsoon season the overuse of groundwater without proper replenishment has come at the cost of its depletion wada et al 2010 and increasing dependence on groundwater has led to the need for understanding its pattern and occurrence on a global scale fan et al 2013 unconfined aquifers containing shallow groundwater are of particular concern as they contribute about 15 of surface water fan et al 2013 and are influenced by climatic interaction cuthbert et al 2019 döll 2009 interestingly the widely believed notion that water tables are the subdued replica of topography has revealed the conditions under which the water table could follow or not the topography in a study by haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 the approach of conducting a study of individual water cycle components in isolation has led to an incomplete understanding of the hydrological cycle it has necessitated including groundwater as a component in the hydrological modeling exercise for example the inclusion of natural groundwater level dynamics in land surface hydrological modeling koirala et al 2014 and partitioning transpiration from groundwater flow maxwell and condon 2016 in case the occurrence of groundwater is unknown due to the complex nature of the aquifer which is characterized by the properties of a porous medium the alternative is to carry out mathematical modeling the mathematical model which is often derived using partial derivatives gets difficulty to predict groundwater level gwl due to the requirement of parametric values governing groundwater flow in this regard several attempts have been made in the past to predict gwl using numerical models like standalone modflow langevin et al 2017 and tightly coupled models like parflow and hydrogeosphere ashby and falgout 1996 brunner and simmons 2012 however numerical models are computationally expensive when running for a large model with high resolution de graaf et al 2015 wood et al 2011 in addition to this integrated models also require model spin up initialization warm up to achieve model equilibrium stability ajami et al 2014 it can get accrued to the cumulative computational cost recently there is also an attempt to solve complex groundwater problems both in the analytical and semi analytical frameworks as reported by ameli and craig 2014 in both cases the common part is the requirement of sufficient domain knowledge and mathematical and numerical skills that could be acquired only with a steep learning curve to circumvent the requirements of a considerable amount of groundwater system knowledge and to overcome some of the rigidities mentioned earlier researchers have looked for an alternative in artificial intelligence ai to make predictions by mapping different combinations of input output variables a t c on application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000 of groundwater level liu et al 2021 poursaeid et al 2022 mozaffari et al 2022 the biggest advantage of the ai model is that we can include as many influencing variables to map the inputs to output s as in our study the temperature and tidal height are utilized in groundwater level modeling and they are not part of the numerical groundwater equations 3 d or 2 d models furthermore one of the input parameters for a numerical groundwater model is hydraulic conductivity which is costly to obtain by utilizing field exploration and experiments ai models do not need hydraulic conductivity values to map the influencing and response variables our study area is vulnerable to seawater intrusion with sparse data even groundwater level records therefore ai models are more suited for our study however the highly stochastic and non stationary nature of groundwater makes the prediction of groundwater fluctuation very complicated and it is not easy to accurately model by implementing single ai techniques such as ann therefore new and accurate mhas are still required to predict groundwater levels sufficiently research aims and objectives this paper proposes an improved ai model augmented artificial ecosystem optimization based multi layer perceptron aaeo mlp built based on the proposed aaeo algorithm and standard multi layer perceptron network the proposed aaeo algorithm is developed based on the standard artificial ecosystem optimization aeo the levy flight trajectory utilization in the exploration and exploitation phases allows aaeo to get past aeo s early convergence and get stuck in local optimality problems the aaeo hybridized with a multi layer perceptron network can achieve higher quality results through these enhancements consequently the proposed aaeo mlp model deals with the groundwater level modeling problem to demonstrate its capabilities we experimented on two time series datasets 1989 2012 collected at two different wells in india several explanatory variables such as monthly cumulative precipitation mean temperature tidal height and previous measurements of gwl have been considered for modeling 1 month ahead gwl in addition to evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm we also compared the results of aaeo mlp with 17 other models including the aeo mlp hybrid model 3 different variants of aeo based mlp and 13 well known models in terms of forecasting accuracy model s convergence and model s stability based on six metrics e g mean absolute error root mean square error kling gupta efficiency normalized nash sutcliffe efficiency pearson s correlation index a20 index finally we summarize the contributions of this paper as 1 the development of aaeo to overcome current disadvantages of aeo e g limited and unbalanced exploitation and exploration phases 2 the application of aaeo to optimize mlp for groundwater level modeling and 3 the comparison of aaeo with numerous benchmark metaheuristic algorithms coupled with mlp in terms of model performance metrics

we conclude the paper and provide ideas for future research in section 6 2 related works the application of an artificial neural network ann has been widely applied in hydrology for the past three decades a t c on application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000 including gwl prediction rajaee et al 2019 osman et al 2022 for example ann has been extensively applied to predict streamflow hadi and tombul 2018 wagena et al 2020 flood jahangir et al 2019 pashazadeh and javan 2020 drought nabipour et al 2020 ribeiro et al 2019 precipitation ahmed et al 2020 praveen et al 2020 inflow ahmad and hossain 2019 bayatvarkeshi et al 2020 evapotranspiration ferreira et al 2019 walls et al 2020 relative humidity bayatvarkeshi et al 2020 lake level ebtehaj et al 2019 river water temperature graf et al 2019 river salinity swain et al 2017 and groundwater storage chen et al 2019 similarly there have been several applications of ann to predict gwl around the same time when such techniques were applied to predict other hydrological variables for the sustainable withdrawal of freshwater groundwater is likely to be under threat when it is influenced by seawater intrusion kumar et al 2020 in the last decade there has been a surge in the application of ai techniques in predicting groundwater level variation sahoo and jha 2013 yoon et al 2016 however most of the application techniques have centered around time series data transformation of input variables zhang et al 2019 malekzadeh et al 2019 hybridization of ann in which gradient based optimizers are replaced with nature based optimizers banadkooki et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 to circumvent the entrapment to the local optimal solution natarajan and sudheer 2020 for example kisi et al 2017 applied three evolutionary based anns to predict the monthly groundwater level particle swarm optimization pso based ann performed the best as compared to the other two optimizer based anns in another study the best performance of groundwater level prediction was obtained by multilayer perceptron mlp integrated to whale algorithm wa in comparison to radial basis function rbf based wa and genetic programming banadkooki et al 2020 nature inspired optimization fausto et al 2020 is a class of meta heuristic algorithms mhas inspired by hunting behaviors or social interactions among individuals or creatures in nature del ser et al 2019 generally nature inspired algorithms solve optimization problems by mimicking a biological or physical phenomenon del ser et al 2019 however depending on their source of inspiration metaheuristics can be classified into several categories thieu and mirjalili 2022 that include evolutionary based physics based swarm based human based math based bio based and system based group we listed the inspiration and some featured algorithms of the different categories of nature inspired algorithms in table 1 mhas characteristics are simplicity ease of implementation due to their natural origin the ability to search for solutions locally and globally avoiding the requirement of gradient information avoiding premature convergence and the ability to preserve intermediate solutions chakraborty and kar 2017 due to their unique characteristics they have been widely used in the research field and real world problems for example image detection riaz et al 2022 wind speed estimation shamshirband et al 2014 task scheduling in cloud computing houssein et al 2021 image segmentation mesejo et al 2016 laser welding quality petković 2017 improved machine learning techniques such as svm jović et al 2016 neural network petković et al 2017 and anfis model petković et al 2016 artificial ecosystem optimization aeo zhao et al 2019 is the most recently proposed system based algorithm it mimics the flow of energy in an ecosystem on earth and includes the three unique behaviors of living organisms production consumption and decomposition it has been shown that the aeo can provide very competitive results when compared with other well known algorithms such as ga pso and woa in solving different benchmark problems nevertheless as a new optimizer aeo still has some drawbacks eid et al 2020 the first is the unreliable behaviors in the decomposition stage exploitation phase due to the linear weight coefficient leading to a low quality final solution and unbalanced between the exploration and exploitation phases the second is the lack of maintaining the diversity of solutions that may lead to stagnation or a local optimum solution from the classification of nature inspired algorithms above it is obvious that different optimizer has been developed to target different problems therefore in the interest of technical development there is always a need for a novel or improved optimizer to be developed and evaluated for a particular problem to obtain superior results than the existing algorithms in this paper an improved algorithm called augmented aeo aaeo is developed to overcome the issues of aeo mentioned above in the proposed aaeo the levy flight trajectory is introduced and optimized in both exploration and exploitation phases to efficiently achieve enhanced diversity of solutions and assist the algorithm in approaching more promising areas of the solution space besides using gaussian random walk in all dimensions searches space to help increase the exploitation of aeo aside from the primary motivation for this developed algorithm mentioned above no algorithm is superior for solving all problems according to the no free lunch nfl theory wolpert and macready 1997 though several optimization algorithms have been mentioned above nfl claims that no algorithm is uniformly perfect so there is always room for improvement furthermore superior techniques for various scientific problems must continuously be developed and tested because they save the scientific community s time and effort making a significant contribution to the field 3 materials and methods 3 1 preliminary background 3 1 1 artificial neural networks an artificial neural network seeks to mimic the functioning of the human brain abiodun et al 2018 processing units make up anns which in turn consist of inputs and outputs the inputs are used by an ann to learn how to produce the desired output feedforward neural networks ffnns are the most famous form of anns which can approximate any nonlinear function zhang and suganthan 2016 multi layer perceptron heidari et al 2019a mlp is a special class of ffnn in mlp data transitions in a directional mode forwards via three types of layers input hidden and output layers fig 1 shows an mlp with a fully connected single hidden layer each layer consists of several neurons which use activation functions to linearly or non linearly transform the input to the neuron into an output in general the connections between individual neurons in neighboring layers are called weights each neuron after the first layer typically includes a bias the weights and bias of an mlp are known as the model parameters which need to be tuned optimized to ensure that the inputs provided to the network produce outputs that minimize an objective function such as the mean square error mse the mathematical relationship between inputs weights biases and outputs in a single hidden layer mlp is given by eq 1 1 y k f j w j k f i w i j x i 2 f γ x γ e x 1 if x 0 x if x 0 where w i j are the weights connecting the input and hidden layers w j k are the weights connecting the hidden and output layers and f is an activation function typically the sigmoid function zhang et al 2018 is often used as an activation function however recently the exponential linear unit elu trottier et al 2017 as shown in eq 2 when γ 1 has been more widely adopted in practice shah et al 2016 li et al 2018 when γ 0 elu becomes the well known rectified linear unit relu hara et al 2015 the first step in designing the mlp is to set its structure which is defined by the input s used in the input layer the number of neurons used in the hidden layer s and the output s used in the output layer additionally the type of activation function used in the hidden and output layers needs to be defined since the input s and output s in mlp are fixed the structure of the mlp is defined by the number of neurons in the hidden layer s once the structure of the mlp has been set and the activation functions selected the back propagation algorithm e g gradient descent is typically used andrychowicz et al 2016 to update train calibrate the network parameters weights and biases such that an objective function e g mse is minimized since the back propagation algorithm is often prone to finding local minima metaheuristic algorithms such as aeo and aaeo that are not as susceptible to this issue can be used to train mlp instead 3 1 2 artificial ecosystem optimization aeo the artificial ecosystem optimization aeo introduced in zhao et al 2019 is a system based optimization algorithm inspired by the interaction and movement of living organisms in an ecosystem similar to other metaheuristics aeo has two main stages including exploration and exploitation in aeo the exploration stage represents the consumption process in which the random search is used to discover the entire search space i e solution space or in the context of mlp parameter space the exploitation stage is devoted to the decomposition process to be able to balance both stages the production process introduced in zhao et al 2019 is used in aeo there are three types of organisms producer consumer and decomposer there is a single producer which is considered the worst agent or the poorest solution a single decomposer which is considered the best agent or current best solution and other individuals named consumers which represent intermediate solutions each agent has an energy level or nutrition as a fitness value which measures the level of how good a solution is concerning the objective function higher energy levels and nutrition indicate better fitness values in the following sub sections the main stages of aeo namely production consumption and decomposition are briefly discussed the more details can be found in zhao et al 2019 however before describing these stages in aeo the initialization process a common process in all metaheuristic algorithms is described first a initialization the algorithm first creates n solutions agents n the size of the population each solution with d dimensional in our case d is equal to the number of parameters in mlp by using the uniform random distribution in the search space as follows 3 x r a n d x i j x i j m i n r a n d i j x i j m a x x i j m i n i 1 n j 1 d where x i j x r a n d is the random position vector of the i th solution x i j m i n and x i j m a x denote the minimum and maximum values for the j th dimension of i th solution r a n d is a uniform random value in the interval of 0 1 solutions are then evaluated for their fitness using an objective functions b production stage in this stage the producer the worst agent is changed via lower and upper bounds while the decomposer guides other agents to seek for enriching areas i e better solutions during the production stage a new individual is created using the best agent x b e s t and randomly selected agent x r a n d within the search space to replace the previous one it can be modeled mathematically by eqs 4 and 5 4 x w o r s t g 1 1 α x b e s t g α x r a n d g 5 α 1 g g m a x r 1 where g and g m a x are the current and maximum generation respectively r 1 is a uniform random number in 0 1 α is the linear weight coefficient x r a n d is the random position of the agent and created based on eq 3 the purpose of the producer x w o r s t is to guide other agents to extensively explore the search space in early generations while also guiding them to exploit other promising solutions around x b e s t in the later generations c consumption stage the consumption stage occurs once the production process has finished its purpose is to improve upon the solutions from the production stage each consumer herbivore carnivore or omnivore updates its nutrition through eating either a randomly selected lower nutrition consumer or producer or both in zhao et al 2019 the authors proposed a levy flight operator that mimics the food searching process of many animals and is referred to as a consumption operator in aeo the consumption factor is used to explore the search area for reducing the complexity of parameter tuning in aeo a parameter free random walk can be considered as shown in eq 6 6 c v 1 2 v 2 v 1 n 0 1 v 2 n 0 1 where n 0 1 represents the normal distribution c is a consumption factor that enables the ability to escape local optima and better explore the search area the updating process of all consumers in aeo is described as follows herbivore this agent can only take the nutrition from producer x w o r s t and it can be modeled by eq 7 carnivore this agent gets the nutrition from a random higher nutrition consumer modeled by eq 8 omnivore this agent can get nutrition from both producer and consumer with higher nutrition in a random position it can be modeled by eq 9 7 x i g 1 x i g c x i g x w o r s t g 8 x i g 1 x i g c x i g x j g 9 x i g 1 x i g c r 2 x i g x w o r s t g 1 r 2 x i g x j g where i 2 n j r a n d i 2 i 1 i j r 2 is a uniform random number in 0 1 as can be seen the consumption stage emphasizes the exploration process by generating new solutions according to the worst or a randomly chosen agent or both d decomposition stage after the consumption stage has finished the decomposition stage begins where a decomposer begins decomposing the remaining parts of the dead agents the decomposition stage focuses on the exploitation of the best solution to identify better solutions that are nearby in the solution space the decomposition process is given by eq 10 10 x i g 1 x b e s t e e x b e s t h x i g where e 3 u u n 0 1 is the decomposition factor e r 3 r a n d i 1 2 1 and h 2 r 3 1 are two weight parameters r 3 is uniform random number in range 0 1 finally we visualize the flowchart of the aeo algorithm in fig 2 3 1 3 levy flight trajectory levy flight chegini et al 2018 is a class of non gaussian random processes whose random walks are drawn from a levy stable distribution this distribution is a simple power law formula l s s 1 β where 0 β 2 is an index s is the step length from a mathematical point of view it can be described as haklı and uğuz 2014 amirsadri et al 2018 eq 11 11 l s γ μ γ 2 π e x p γ 2 s μ 1 s μ 3 2 if 0 μ s 0 if s 0 where μ is the location or shift parameter γ 0 is the scale parameter which controls the scale of the distribution s is the step length of a random walk in this paper using the advantage of symmetric positive or negative value levy stable distribution in mantegna s algorithm jensi and jiji 2016 the step length of s is calculated through eq 12 12 s u v 1 β 13 u n 0 σ u 2 v n 0 σ v 2 14 σ u γ 1 β s i n π β 2 γ 1 β 2 β 2 β 1 2 σ v 1 where u and v are values drawn from a normal gaussian distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of σ u 2 and σ v 2 respectively the distribution for s follows the anticipated levy distribution for s s 0 where s 0 represents the minimum step length and γ is the gamma function estimated by eq 15 15 γ 1 β 0 t β e d t a step size can be generated by levy distribution using eq 16 in which g is generation counter s g is estimated using eq 12 meanwhile u n i f o r m 0 1 is a random uniform value in the range 0 1 the 0 01 multiplier is used to ensure the step size generated by the levy distribution respects the problem produces the allowed in range solution 16 s t e p g 0 01 s g u n i f o r m 0 1 besides the multiplier the β parameter is the most vital parameter in the levy distribution a greater value of β leads to higher exploration and avoidance of being trapped in local optimums meanwhile a smaller value of β leads to higher exploitation amirsadri et al 2018 therefore β must be selected carefully to find a proper balance between high exploration and exploitation previous studies jensi and jiji 2016 amirsadri et al 2018 recommend selecting β within the range of 0 2 3 2 proposed methods in this section we will describe the proposed model for the groundwater modeling problem in depth the proposed model is known as aaeo mlp and comprises two parts augmented artificial ecosystem optimization and the multi layer perceptron network the proposed aaeo algorithm will be described in detail in the following section 3 2 1 proposed augmented artificial ecosystem optimization aaeo algorithm while the aeo algorithm is noted for its strong global search ability zhao et al 2019 once the method approaches the near optimal solution it is characterized by a low convergence rate due to a higher exploration rate in production and consumption stages compared to the exploitation rate in the decomposition stage hence in this paper we use the levy flight trajectory and gaussian normal random walks to augment the exploration global search and exploitation local search ability of the aeo algorithm resulting in augmented aeo our suggested optimizer aaeo uses the step sizes generated by the levy distribution to explore and take advantage of the search area upgraded consumption stage exploration phase in this phase before determining whether the selected agent updates its position based on herbivore omnivore or carnivore it will have a 50 chance to update by one of three living organisms and a 50 chance to update its position by our proposed levy flight trajectory based on eq 17 17 x i g 1 x i g s t e p g 1 x i g x b e s t recalling eq 12 16 the step size s t e p g 1 is generated by levy distribution with β value randomized in range of 1 2 using the β in the range 1 2 ensures that the agent has more chance on a big move to be able to escape from local optima leading to higher exploration meanwhile x b e s t is used to guide the agent in the direction of the optimal solution upgraded decomposition stage exploitation phase as can be seen from eq 10 the updating position of the current agent is limited to one dimension of a random number by a factor of e besides the unnecessary weight parameters e and h lead to unexpected behaviors in this process meaning it can produce a small jump or large jump depending on the outcome of these parameters to stabilize this phase as the exploitation process we re designed the updating position eq 10 and proposed to use eq 18 instead in which unnecessary parameters e and h are removed and the factor e is replaced by a gaussian distribution vector of d dimension through this modification the local search ability is strengthened in every dimension of the search space 18 x i g 1 x b e s t n o r m a l 0 1 d x b e s t x i g where is element wise multiplication beside the implementation of gaussian random walk to further enhance the local search of aeo we propose to use the levy flight trajectory with a small step size in this stage a simple mechanism as the consumption phase is employed in which the currently selected agent will have a 50 chance to update its position through the improved decomposition process eq 18 and a 50 chance to update its position by the levy trajectory eq 19 with β value randomized in range of 0 1 using the β in the range 0 1 ensures that the agent exploits promising solutions near the current global best solution i e higher exploitation meanwhile x b e s t is operated to guide the agent in the direction of the optimal solution 19 x g 1 i x b e s t s t e p g 1 x b e s t x g i thus by upgrading both the consumption and decomposition stage through the levy flight trajectory and gaussian random walk the proposed aaeo algorithm is quipped with improved local and global search capabilities making the method better at finding the optimal solution and accelerating the convergence rate when compared to aeo moreover the decomposition stage is reworked to concentrate on the exploitation only leading to the balance between both phases finally the pseudo code of aaeo is provided in algorithm 1 3 2 2 summary of the proposed model aaeo mlp to build a forecasting model for gwl we propose to use aaeo combined with the mlp network the complete aaeo mlp model for gwl is shown in fig 3 there are three phases in our model including data preprocessing modeling and evaluation data preprocessing in this phase we first collect the monthly measurements of cumulative rainfall mean air temperature tidal height and gwl from different wells the data is then preprocessed with quality assessment and cleaning steps then we split data into training and testing datasets the training dataset is used for the feature selection step and modeling phase meanwhile the testing dataset is used for the evaluation phase in this study the mutual information based mi method is utilized to select the best features for the model mutual information measures the entropy drops under the condition of the target value its score falls in the range of 0 1 the higher value the closer connection between the current feature and the target which suggests that we should take this feature to train the model once the appropriate time lag for each explanatory variable has been determined the collection of the time lagged explanatory variables is considered as inputs to the aaeo mlp to forecast monthly gwl at a lead time of one month ahead i e the output variable modeling in this process aaeo mlp will learn from the training dataset and produce the best model for the evaluation phase the general flow of this stage is as follows the mlp weights and biases parameters are encoded as decision variables a solution an objective function is selected e g mse and the aaeo algorithm is used to tune the mlp parameters when the maximum number of generations is reached in the aaeo algorithm the optimal parameter vector is stored and used to evaluate the aaeo mlp on an independent test set evaluation phase evaluation in this phase the trained aaeo mlp model is evaluated on the testing dataset with a wide number of performance metrics commonly adopted in hydrology these metrics are mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse pearson s correlation index r kling gupta efficiency kge and a20 index a20 besides normalized version of nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse was also used these indices are computed as follows 20 mae y y ˆ i 1 n y ˆ y n 21 rmse y y ˆ i 1 n y ˆ y 2 n 22 nse y y ˆ 1 i 0 n 1 y i y i ˆ 2 i 0 n 1 y i μ y nnse y y ˆ 1 2 nse y y ˆ 23 a20 y y ˆ m 20 n 24 r

description the study region of dakshina kannada district karnataka india is characterized by a humid and tropical climate with the western ghats mountain ranges in the east and the arabian sea in the west the region receives about 4000 mm of annual rainfall out of which the southwest monsoon june september contributes 70 to 80 of the total rainfall and the remaining comes from the northeast monsoon during october and november despite receiving a large amount of rainfall from the southwest monsoon in some years there is rationing of water during the summer season march may if sufficient rainfall is not received during the northeast monsoon agriculture being the main sector of the region uses 75 of irrigated water from groundwater sources to irrigate commonly grown crops such as areca nut cashew nut coconut and paddy lathashri and mahesha 2016 uttarwar et al 2020 the most predominant soil type in the region is red lateritic which results in the existence of unconfined aquifers 12 30 m depth with varying texture from fine to granular formation underlain by a fault of gneiss lathashri and mahesha 2016 such type of soil renders the aquifers to be of high permeability leading to the loss of water in the form of surface and subsurface runoff several monitoring wells are maintained in the district by the department of mines and geology government of karnataka india the monthly depth to groundwater table dgwt data were collected for two observation wells at ganjimutt from 1989 to 2010 and surathkal from 1989 to 2012 fig 4 the dgwt is used to represent the groundwater level in this study the details of the two wells are given in table 2 the wells have been selected with one far away 17 3 km from the coast and the other close to it 1 km from previous studies by mahesha et al 2012 uttarwar et al 2020 the gwl at these wells are known to be influenced by tidal height th though the influence of th on gwl is normally expected for a short duration i e days as reported in a study by yoon et al 2011 the conditional distribution of gwl given th even at a monthly scale has shown to have significant dependence structure in a study by uttarwar et al 2020 for this study monthly long term th data was collected from the permanent service for mean sea level psmsl daily gauge based gridded precipitation 0 25 x 0 25 from india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 was collected and then converted to monthly data derived by summing daily data for the period 1989 2012 the monthly mean air temperature for each month was derived by summing daily mean air temperature divided by the number of days of a particular month srivastava et al 2009 previous measurements of monthly precipitation air temperature tidal height and groundwater level were considered as explanatory variables while gwl at a lead time of 1 month was considered as the target response variable there was a total of 56 measurements of the explanatory and target variables that were used to develop and evaluate the different models 4 2 feature selection the mutual information mi measure was used to select the best inputs i e lagged versions of the explanatory variables mentioned above for developing the gwl forecasting models at the two wells ganjimutt and surathkal fig 5 shows mi scores for each explanatory variable rainfall r cm tidal height th m mean air temperature t c and groundwater level gwl m considered for the model development in the graph each dot or circle represents the mi value of t th lag of corresponding explanatory variables blue rainfall orange tidal height blue mean air temperature and red gwl all the mi scores were obtained between gwl at time t and the corresponding lag of explanatory variables after manually inspecting the figures optimal input combinations were generated to develop the best model for each well in this study a threshold of mi scores exceeding 0 5 and 0 4 were used for ganjimutt and surathkal wells respectively as an example to obtain optimal inputs of rainfall r from the corresponding mi of ganjimutt well the mi values between r and gwl values at lags 0 1 exceed the limit of 0 5 therefore these values are used for inputs to the models to forecast gwl at the current time t 0 the other optimal lags were also determined similarly 4 3 model comparison to assess the performance of the proposed aaeo mlp model for the monthly gwl modeling problem first we compare aeo mlp to aaeo mlp to demonstrate that the aaeo proposed method outperforms the traditional aeo algorithm in terms of optimization ability second we picked 16 featured algorithms below from various categories of nature inspired algorithms as nfl theory expresses there is no single best algorithm for all problems nfl theory different algorithms are

modified artificial ecosystem optimization 16 eaeo mlp eid et al 2020 enhanced artificial ecosystem optimization 4 4 parameter configurations for the neural network the architecture included 1 input layer 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer the activation function in hidden and output layers was set to the elu selvin et al 2017 fu et al 2016 the input number of nodes in the input layer was set equal to the number of features selected from section 4 2 the number of neurons in the hidden layer was tuned from the number of inputs to 1 twice the number of inputs aljarah et al 2018 mirjalili et al 2014 the number of neurons in the output layer was equal to 1 the metaheuristic algorithms are implemented using the open source python library mealpy thieu and mirjalili 2022 with the maximum generation g m a x and the population size p s were set to 1000 and 50 respectively for all the hho eo fbio cgo aeo iaeo maeo eaeo and our proposed aaeo algorithms required the specification of only g m a x and p s parameters however other metaheuristic algorithms require the specification of additional parameters we used trial and error method to find the best parameters for each algorithm and the best parameters are noted in table 3 5 results and discussion we present the experimental outcomes from two different scenarios in this section the first scenario examines the findings of the aaeo mlp model to the results of the classical aeo mlp model the second scenario shows the comparison results of the aaeo mlp model and the previously mentioned metaheuristics algorithm based mlp network the three main aspects discussed in both scenarios are prediction ability model convergence and model stability 5 1 performance analysis of aaeo mlp versus aeo mlp 5 1 1 prediction assessment we evaluated the prediction performance of aaeo mlp versus aeo mlp using six metrics namely mae rmse r nnse kge and a20 for two monthly gwl datasets each model is executed 10 times based on its most effective parameters the mean values of each metric and each model are recorded table 4 shows the mean of each metric of each model for the dataset of both ganjimutt gan and surathkal sur wells table 4 shows that aaeo mlp outperforms aeo mlp in both ganjimutt and surathkal with respect to all metrics for example in the ganjimutt well the values of metrics mae and rmse for the unseen testing data of aaeo mlp are 0 897 and 1 274 compared to metrics of aeo mlp 1 038 and 1 425 respectively in the surathkal well aaeo mlp beats aeo mlp in the metrics r nnse and a20 with corresponding values 0 806 0 714 and 0 827 versus 0 779 0 693 and 0 819 as can be seen our proposed model aaeo mlp fits well in the training phase and has good skills in predicting gwl in the testing phase the reason is that the upgraded strategy with levy flight trajectory and gaussian random walk in exploration and exploitation improve the aaeo s improved optimizing ability consequently it helps aaeo mlp to obtain optimal results better than aeo the observed versus predicted gwl values are visualized via line plots in fig 6 the line plots show that the aaeo mlp predicted values closer to its observed ground truth data than aeo mlp in both wells all the applied models could not capture some gwl values especially the extreme ones the limited number of data can explain it because we used monthly intervals and more data may improve the models accuracy the other important issue which can be derived from fig 6 that the models are more successful in simulating and predicting the gwl of ganjimutt well compared to surathkal this can be explained by the lower mutual information scores between the influential input variables and gwl for the surathkal see fig 5 5 1 2 model convergence metaheuristic algorithms do not arrive at a given optimal solution in a few iterations even for linear problems however for a highly complex aquifer system where the groundwater level variation is highly non linear the need for understanding convergence rates is of high importance when such algorithms run over hundreds of iterations such algorithms converge based on a stopping criterion in our study the training dataset with mse as a loss function which is the acceptable error one like to achieve or the maximum number of training iterations calibration budget fig 7 shows the training loss of aaeo mlp versus aeo mlp in both wells it is evident that the aaeo mlp model converges to the minimal error faster than aeo mlp and aeo mlp cannot reach the minimal error level as aaeo mlp in the last generations for example at the ganjimutt well in a few initial generations i e five epochs the aeo mlp has better mse loss due to the aaeo mlp taking time to explore more the search space it will ensure aaeo mlp can jump out of local optimal after 25 epochs aeo mlp stops reducing the loss and aaeo mlp keeps finding better results with smaller losses it shows that applying the levy flight trajectory in both the exploration and exploitation phases of aaeo makes the algorithm archive more balanced in explore and exploit ability when finding optimal value 5 1 3 model stability metaheuristic algorithms are stochastic thus each model run will yield slightly different results that should on average converge to the optimal solution given a sufficient number of training iterations therefore stability indicates how much individual runs vary in terms of the objective function with the number of training iterations held constant a higher level of stability lower variability among different runs is typically seen as a good quality of a metaheuristic algorithm to compare the stability of the various algorithms each model was run 10 times and different performance metrics were compared to one another on the test set the standard deviation std values of each metric and each model were recorded table 5 shows the standard deviation of each metric of each model for the dataset of both ganjimutt gan and surathkal sur wells the standard deviation of the performance metrics represents how far each data point is from the mean value the lower deviation on all counts of performance metrics is an indication that a model performed quite stable whereas a higher value is attributed to the fluctuating performance of the model from table 5 considering the test dataset aaeo mlp outperforms aeo mlp according to all of the metrics in particular the aaeo mlp has standard deviation value at 0 02 for mae metric meanwhile the corresponding value for the aeo mlp is 0 095 we also visualize the distribution of metrics mae rmse nnse after ten trials of aaeo mlp and aeo mlp based on the boxplot shown in fig 8 a box plot box and whisker plot is a chart that depicts the five data distributions minimum value min first quartile q1 median median third quartile q3 and maximum value max as a result a model that provides the metric distribution in a narrow range can indicate its stability characteristics from fig 8 it is clear that our proposed aaeo significantly improved the persistence compared to aeo when optimizing the mlp network using the levy flight approach and gaussian random walk in both the exploration and exploitation phase is well justified and particularly useful in improving one of the critical characteristics of the aaeo 5 2 performance analysis of aaeo mlp versus other metaheuristic algorithm based mlp 5 2 1 prediction assessment in this scenario our proposed model aaeo mlp is compared with 16 other well known models for solving monthly gwl prediction problems same as the first test we evaluate models using 6 metrics that include mae rmse r nnse kge and a20 for two datasets each model is executed ten times based on its most effective parameters and these metric values are recorded table 6 shows the mean of each model metric for the dataset of ganjimutt and surathkal wells for ganjimutt well table 6 shows that only efo mlp and fbio mlp beat our proposed model aaeo mlp on four metrics mae rmse r and nnse in the training set however for unseen data the aaeo mlp outperforms all 16 models concerning almost all metrics significantly aaeo mlp outperforms all the other variants of aeo such as iaeo mlp eaeo mlp and maeo mlp in both the training and testing phases for example the values of metrics rmse nnse and a20 for the unseen testing data of aaeo mlp are 1 274 0 736 and 0 622 compared to metrics of iaeo mlp 1 438 0 686 and 0 558 eaeo mlp 1 438 0 686 and 0 562 and maeo mlp 1 398 0 698 and 0 558 respectively these results indicate that aaeo mlp as a newly developed model in this field of gwl modeling can provide higher forecasting performance compared to other predictive models for ganjimutt well for surathkal well table 6 indicates that only fbio mlp beat aaeo mlp on 5 metrics mae rmse r nnse and kge in the training dataset however in the testing dataset our proposed aaeo mlp outperforms fbio mlp and all other models on all metrics it once again proved that the aaeo mlp fits nicely in the training phase and has good skills in predicting gwl in the testing phase 5 2 2 model convergence we show the convergence chart of aaeo mlp versus other metaheuristic based mlp networks in fig 9 it is evident that the aaeo mlp and fbio mlp models converge to the minimal error faster than the other models e g hho mlp chio mlp and the cgo mlp could not reach the minimal error in particular at ganjimutt well aaeo fbio eo eaeo and maeo algorithms after 40 iterations converged extremely quickly to almost the same error 0 017 after that only aaeo mlp and fbio mlp and maeo mlp can go down further however after 500 iterations maeo mlp stops decreasing meanwhile aaeo mlp and fbio mlp keep going down a little bit further the same event can be observed at surathkal well but after 50 iterations maeo mlp converges faster than aaeo mlp at the error of 0 007 however after 250 iterations the aaeo mlp outperforms maeo mlp by reducing the error thus it is apparent that our proposed model aaeo mlp dramatically improves the convergence properties of aeo and results in quicker convergence and helps find a better objective function value this is because the levy flight trajectory was used during the exploration phase it enables aaeo mlp to escape local optimal that maeo mlp cannot resulting in better optimal search than maeo mlp and other models 5 2 3 model stability in this section the standard deviation values of 6 metrics after 10 experiment trials of the proposed model aaeo mlp versus 16 other well known models are recorded in table 7 in addition we also present the box plot of all compared models in figs 10 and 11 table 5 clearly indicates that when considering the test dataset the best performing models with the lowest standard deviation are aaeo mlp mvo mlp eo mlp and ga mlp meanwhile pso mlp hho mlp and chio mlp are the models with the highest volatility in particular the aaeo mlp has an standard deviation value of 0 02 for the mae metric meanwhile the corresponding values for the iaeo mlp eaeo mlp and maeo mlp are 0 056 0 08 and 0 034 respectively as shown in fig 10 at ganjimutt well for metric mae the most steady model is aaeo mlp followed by the mvo mlp maeo mlp and ga mlp aaeo mlp is also the second stabilized model in the rmse metric after mvo mlp and the third persistent model in the nnse metric after the mvo mlp and ga mlp the two most erratic models in terms of the mae metric are pso mlp and ssa mlp meanwhile pso mlp and aeo mlp are the most varying models in both rmse and nnse metrics similarly at surathkal well fig 11 the aaeo mlp and eo mlp are the most steady models in terms of three metrics mae rmse and nnse the de mlp pso mlp chio mlp and eaeo mlp are the most inconsistent models based on the results of the preceding analyses it can be stated that our improved strategy with levy flight trajectory and gaussian random walk assist the aeo algorithm in finding optimal results better than other metaheuristic based mlp networks furthermore the balance between the exploration and exploitation phases is maintained resulting in aaeo s extreme stability 6 conclusions the present study proposed an improved ai technique augmented artificial ecosystem optimization based multi layer perceptron aaeo mlp to develop a gwl prediction model the proposed model aaeo mlp is built based on a novel augmented version of the aeo algorithm and the traditional mlp network in aaeo the levy flight technique and gaussian random walk are introduced in the exploration and exploitation phases to improve

2274,nature inspired optimization is an active area of research in the artificial intelligence ai field and has recently been adopted in hydrology for the calibration training of both process based

groundwater level modeling coastal aquifers augmented artificial ecosystem optimization nature inspired computing meta heuristic algorithms neural network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the preferred source of freshwater in ever increasing urbanization industrialization and rapid expansion of arable land due to the interrupted supply of surface water which is dependent on timely monsoon season the overuse of groundwater without proper replenishment has come at the cost of its depletion wada et al 2010 and increasing dependence on groundwater has led to the need for understanding its pattern and occurrence on a global scale fan et al 2013 unconfined aquifers containing shallow groundwater are of particular concern as they contribute about 15 of surface water fan et al 2013 and are influenced by climatic interaction cuthbert et al 2019 döll 2009 interestingly the widely believed notion that water tables are the subdued replica of topography has revealed the conditions under which the water table could follow or not the topography in a study by haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 the approach of conducting a study of individual water cycle components in isolation has led to an incomplete understanding of the hydrological cycle it has necessitated including groundwater as a component in the hydrological modeling exercise for example the inclusion of natural groundwater level dynamics in land surface hydrological modeling koirala et al 2014 and partitioning transpiration from groundwater flow maxwell and condon 2016 in case the occurrence of groundwater is unknown due to the complex nature of the aquifer which is characterized by the properties of a porous medium the alternative is to carry out mathematical modeling the mathematical model which is often derived using partial derivatives gets difficulty to predict groundwater level gwl due to the requirement of parametric values governing groundwater flow in this regard several attempts have been made in the past to predict gwl using numerical models like standalone modflow langevin et al 2017 and tightly coupled models like parflow and hydrogeosphere ashby and falgout 1996 brunner and simmons 2012 however numerical models are computationally expensive when running for a large model with high resolution de graaf et al 2015 wood et al 2011 in addition to this integrated models also require model spin up initialization warm up to achieve model equilibrium stability ajami et al 2014 it can get accrued to the cumulative computational cost recently there is also an attempt to solve complex groundwater problems both in the analytical and semi analytical frameworks as reported by ameli and craig 2014 in both cases the common part is the requirement of sufficient domain knowledge and mathematical and numerical skills that could be acquired only with a steep learning curve to circumvent the requirements of a considerable amount of groundwater system knowledge and to overcome some of the rigidities mentioned earlier researchers have looked for an alternative in artificial intelligence ai to make predictions by mapping different combinations of input output variables a t c on application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000 of groundwater level liu et al 2021 poursaeid et al 2022 mozaffari et al 2022 the biggest advantage of the ai model is that we can include as many influencing variables to map the inputs to output s as in our study the temperature and tidal height are utilized in groundwater level modeling and they are not part of the numerical groundwater equations 3 d or 2 d models furthermore one of the input parameters for a numerical groundwater model is hydraulic conductivity which is costly to obtain by utilizing field exploration and experiments ai models do not need hydraulic conductivity values to map the influencing and response variables our study area is vulnerable to seawater intrusion with sparse data even groundwater level records therefore ai models are more suited for our study however the highly stochastic and non stationary nature of groundwater makes the prediction of groundwater fluctuation very complicated and it is not easy to accurately model by implementing single ai techniques such as ann therefore new and accurate mhas are still required to predict groundwater levels sufficiently research aims and objectives this paper proposes an improved ai model augmented artificial ecosystem optimization based multi layer perceptron aaeo mlp built based on the proposed aaeo algorithm and standard multi layer perceptron network the proposed aaeo algorithm is developed based on the standard artificial ecosystem optimization aeo the levy flight trajectory utilization in the exploration and exploitation phases allows aaeo to get past aeo s early convergence and get stuck in local optimality problems the aaeo hybridized with a multi layer perceptron network can achieve higher quality results through these enhancements consequently the proposed aaeo mlp model deals with the groundwater level modeling problem to demonstrate its capabilities we experimented on two time series datasets 1989 2012 collected at two different wells in india several explanatory variables such as monthly cumulative precipitation mean temperature tidal height and previous measurements of gwl have been considered for modeling 1 month ahead gwl in addition to evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm we also compared the results of aaeo mlp with 17 other models including the aeo mlp hybrid model 3 different variants of aeo based mlp and 13 well known models in terms of forecasting accuracy model s

finally we summarize the contributions of this paper as 1 the development of aaeo to overcome current disadvantages of aeo e g limited and unbalanced exploitation and exploration phases 2 the application of aaeo to optimize mlp for groundwater level modeling and 3 the comparison of aaeo with numerous benchmark metaheuristic algorithms coupled with mlp in terms of model performance metrics

we conclude the paper and provide ideas for future research in section 6 2 related works the application of an artificial neural network ann has been widely applied in hydrology for the past three decades a t c on application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000 including gwl prediction rajaee et al 2019 osman et al 2022 for example ann has been extensively applied to predict streamflow hadi and tombul 2018 wagena et al 2020 flood jahangir et al 2019 pashazadeh and javan 2020 drought nabipour et al 2020 ribeiro et al 2019 precipitation ahmed et al 2020 praveen et al 2020 inflow ahmad and hossain 2019 bayatvarkeshi et al 2020 evapotranspiration ferreira et al 2019 walls et al 2020 relative humidity bayatvarkeshi et al 2020 lake level ebtehaj et al 2019 river water temperature graf et al 2019 river salinity swain et al 2017 and groundwater storage chen et al 2019 similarly there have been several applications of ann to predict gwl around the same time when such techniques were applied to predict other hydrological variables for the sustainable withdrawal of freshwater groundwater is likely to be under threat when it is influenced by seawater intrusion kumar et al 2020 in the last decade there has been a surge in the application of ai techniques in predicting groundwater level variation sahoo and jha 2013 yoon et al 2016 however most of the application techniques have centered around time series data transformation of input variables zhang et al 2019 malekzadeh et al 2019 hybridization of ann in which gradient based optimizers are replaced with nature based optimizers banadkooki et al 2020 ahmed et al 2021 to circumvent the entrapment to the local optimal solution natarajan and sudheer 2020 for example kisi et al 2017 applied three evolutionary based anns to predict the monthly groundwater level particle swarm optimization pso based ann performed the best as compared to the other two optimizer based anns in another study the best performance of groundwater level prediction was obtained by multilayer perceptron mlp integrated to whale algorithm wa in comparison to radial basis function rbf based wa and genetic programming banadkooki et al 2020 nature inspired optimization fausto et al 2020 is a class of meta heuristic algorithms mhas inspired by hunting behaviors or social interactions among individuals or creatures in nature del ser et al 2019 generally nature inspired algorithms solve optimization problems by mimicking a biological or physical phenomenon del ser et al 2019 however depending on their source of inspiration metaheuristics can be classified into several categories thieu and mirjalili 2022 that include evolutionary based physics based swarm based human based math based bio based and system based group we listed the inspiration and some featured algorithms of the different categories of nature inspired algorithms in table 1 mhas characteristics are simplicity ease of implementation due to their natural origin the ability to search for solutions locally and globally avoiding the requirement of gradient information avoiding premature convergence and the ability to preserve intermediate solutions chakraborty and kar 2017 due to their unique characteristics they have been widely used in the research field and real world problems for example image detection riaz et al 2022 wind speed estimation shamshirband et al 2014 task scheduling in cloud computing houssein et al 2021 image segmentation mesejo et al 2016 laser welding quality petković 2017 improved machine learning techniques such as svm jović et al 2016 neural network petković et al 2017 and anfis model petković et al 2016 artificial ecosystem optimization aeo zhao et al 2019 is the most recently proposed system based algorithm it mimics the flow of energy in an ecosystem on earth and includes the three unique behaviors of living organisms production consumption and decomposition it has been shown that the aeo can provide very competitive results when compared with other well known algorithms such as ga pso and woa in solving different benchmark problems nevertheless as a new optimizer aeo still has some drawbacks eid et al 2020 the first is the unreliable behaviors in the decomposition stage exploitation phase due to the linear weight coefficient leading to a low quality final solution and unbalanced between the exploration and exploitation phases the second is the lack of maintaining the diversity of solutions that may lead to stagnation or a local optimum solution from the classification of nature inspired algorithms above it is obvious that different optimizer has been developed to target different problems therefore in the interest of technical development there is always a need for a novel or improved optimizer to be developed and evaluated for a particular problem to obtain superior results than the existing algorithms in this paper an improved algorithm called augmented aeo aaeo is developed to overcome the issues of aeo mentioned above in the proposed aaeo the levy flight trajectory is introduced and optimized in both exploration and exploitation phases to efficiently achieve enhanced diversity of solutions and assist the algorithm in approaching more promising areas of the solution space besides using gaussian random walk in all dimensions searches space to help increase the exploitation of aeo aside from the primary motivation for this developed algorithm mentioned above no algorithm is superior for solving all problems according to the no free lunch nfl theory wolpert and macready 1997 though several optimization algorithms have been mentioned above nfl claims that no algorithm is uniformly perfect so there is always room for improvement furthermore superior techniques for various scientific problems must continuously be developed and tested because they save the scientific community s time and effort making a significant contribution to the field 3 materials and methods 3 1 preliminary background 3 1 1 artificial neural networks an artificial neural network seeks to mimic the functioning of the human brain abiodun et al 2018 processing units make up anns which in turn consist of inputs and outputs the inputs are used by an ann to learn how to produce the desired output feedforward neural networks ffnns are the most famous form of anns which can approximate any nonlinear function zhang and suganthan 2016 multi layer perceptron heidari et al 2019a mlp is a special class of ffnn in mlp data transitions in a directional mode forwards via three types of layers input hidden and output layers fig 1 shows an mlp with a fully connected single hidden layer each layer consists of several neurons which use activation functions to linearly or non linearly transform the input to the neuron into an output in general the connections between individual neurons in neighboring layers are called weights each neuron after the first layer typically includes a bias the weights and bias of an mlp are known as the model parameters which need to be tuned optimized to ensure that the inputs provided to the network produce outputs that minimize an objective function such as the mean square error mse the mathematical relationship between inputs weights biases and outputs in a single hidden layer mlp is given by eq 1 1 y k f j w j k f i w i j x i 2 f γ x γ e x 1 if x 0 x if x 0 where w i j are the weights connecting the input and hidden layers w j k are the weights connecting the hidden and output layers and f is an activation function typically the sigmoid function zhang et al 2018 is often used as an activation function however recently the exponential linear unit elu trottier et al 2017 as shown in eq 2 when γ 1 has been more widely adopted in practice shah et al 2016 li et al 2018 when γ 0 elu becomes the well known rectified linear unit relu hara et al 2015 the first step in designing the mlp is to set its structure which is defined by the input s used in the input layer the number of neurons used in the hidden layer s and the output s used in the output layer additionally the type of activation function used in the hidden and output layers needs to be defined since the input s and output s in mlp are fixed the structure of the mlp is defined by the number of neurons in the hidden layer s once the structure of the mlp has been set and the activation functions selected the back propagation algorithm e g gradient descent is typically used andrychowicz et al 2016 to update train calibrate the network parameters weights and biases such that an objective function e g mse is minimized since the back propagation algorithm is often prone to finding local minima metaheuristic algorithms such as aeo and aaeo that are not as susceptible to this issue can be used to train mlp instead 3 1 2 artificial ecosystem optimization aeo the artificial ecosystem optimization aeo introduced in zhao et al 2019 is a system based optimization algorithm inspired by the interaction and movement of living organisms in an ecosystem similar to other metaheuristics aeo has two main stages including exploration and exploitation in aeo the exploration stage represents the consumption process in which the random search is used to discover the entire search space i e solution space or in the context of mlp parameter space the exploitation stage is devoted to the decomposition process to be able to balance both stages the production process introduced in zhao et al 2019 is used in aeo there are three types of organisms producer consumer and decomposer there is a single producer which is considered the worst agent or the poorest solution a single decomposer which is considered the best agent or current best solution and other individuals named consumers which represent intermediate solutions each agent has an energy level or nutrition as a fitness value which measures the level of how good a solution is concerning the objective function higher energy levels and nutrition indicate better fitness values in the following sub sections the main stages of aeo namely production consumption and decomposition are briefly discussed the more details can be found in zhao et al 2019 however before describing these stages in aeo the initialization process a common process in all metaheuristic algorithms is described first a initialization the algorithm first creates n solutions agents n the size of the population each solution with d dimensional in our case d is equal to the number of parameters in mlp by using the uniform random distribution in the search space as follows 3 x r a n d x i j x i j m i n r a n d i j x i j m a x x i j m i n i 1 n j 1 d where x i j x r a n d is the random position vector of the i th solution x i j m i n and x i j m a x denote the minimum and maximum values for the j th dimension of i th solution r a n d is a uniform random value in the interval of 0 1 solutions are then evaluated for their fitness using an objective functions b production stage in this stage the producer the worst agent is changed via lower and upper bounds while the decomposer guides other agents to seek for enriching areas i e better solutions during the production stage a new individual is created using the best agent x b e s t and randomly selected agent x r a n d within the search space to replace the previous one it can be modeled mathematically by eqs 4 and 5 4 x w o r s t g 1 1 α x b e s t g α x r a n d g 5 α 1 g g m a x r 1 where g and g m a x are the current and maximum generation respectively r 1 is a uniform random number in 0 1 α is the linear weight coefficient x r a n d is the random position of the agent and created based on eq 3 the purpose of the producer x w o r s t is to guide other agents to extensively explore the search space in early generations while also guiding them to exploit other promising solutions around x b e s t in the later generations c consumption stage the consumption stage occurs once the production process has finished its purpose is to improve upon the solutions from the production stage each consumer herbivore carnivore or omnivore updates its nutrition through eating either a randomly selected lower nutrition consumer or producer or both in zhao et al 2019 the authors proposed a levy flight operator that mimics the food searching process of many animals and is referred to as a consumption operator in aeo the consumption factor is used to explore the search area for reducing the complexity of parameter tuning in aeo a parameter free random walk can be considered as shown in eq 6 6 c v 1 2 v 2 v 1 n 0 1 v 2 n 0 1 where n 0 1 represents the normal distribution c is a consumption factor that enables the ability to escape local optima and better explore the search area the updating process of all consumers in aeo is described as follows herbivore this agent can only take the nutrition from producer x w o r s t and it can be modeled by eq 7 carnivore this agent gets the nutrition from a random higher nutrition consumer modeled by eq 8 omnivore this agent can get nutrition from both producer and consumer with higher nutrition in a random position it can be modeled by eq 9 7 x i g 1 x i g c x i g x w o r s t g 8 x i g 1 x i g c x i g x j g 9 x i g 1 x i g c r 2 x i g x w o r s t g 1 r 2 x i g x j g where i 2 n j r a n d i 2 i 1 i j r 2 is a uniform random number in 0 1 as can be seen the consumption stage emphasizes the exploration process by generating new solutions according to the worst or a randomly chosen agent or both d decomposition stage after the consumption stage has finished the decomposition stage begins where a decomposer begins decomposing the remaining parts of the dead agents the decomposition stage focuses on the exploitation of the best solution to identify better solutions that are nearby in the solution space the decomposition process is given by eq 10 10 x i g 1 x b e s t e e x b e s t h x i g where e 3 u u n 0 1 is the decomposition factor e r 3 r a n d i 1 2 1 and h 2 r 3 1 are two weight parameters r 3 is uniform random number in range 0 1 finally we visualize the flowchart of the aeo algorithm in fig 2 3 1 3 levy flight trajectory levy flight chegini et al 2018 is a class of non gaussian random processes whose random walks are drawn from a levy stable distribution this distribution is a simple power law formula l s s 1 β where 0 β 2 is an index s is the step length from a mathematical point of view it can be described as haklı and uğuz 2014 amirsadri et al 2018 eq 11 11 l s γ μ γ 2 π e x p γ 2 s μ 1 s μ 3 2 if 0 μ s 0 if s 0 where μ is the location or shift parameter γ 0 is the scale parameter which controls the scale of the distribution s is the step length of a random walk in this paper using the advantage of symmetric positive or negative value levy stable distribution in mantegna s algorithm jensi and jiji 2016 the step length of s is calculated through eq 12 12 s u v 1 β 13 u n 0 σ u 2 v n 0 σ v 2 14 σ u γ 1 β s i n π β 2 γ 1 β 2 β 2 β 1 2 σ v 1 where u and v are values drawn from a normal gaussian distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of σ u 2 and σ v 2 respectively the distribution for s follows the anticipated levy distribution for s s 0 where s 0 represents the minimum step length and γ is the gamma function estimated by eq 15 15 γ 1 β 0 t β e d t a step size can be generated by levy distribution using eq 16 in which g is generation counter s g is estimated using eq 12 meanwhile u n i f o r m 0 1 is a random uniform value in the range 0 1 the 0 01 multiplier is used to ensure the step size generated by the levy distribution respects the problem produces the allowed in range solution 16 s t e p g 0 01 s g u n i f o r m 0 1 besides the multiplier the β parameter is the most vital parameter in the levy distribution a greater value of β leads to higher exploration and avoidance of being trapped in local optimums meanwhile a smaller value of β leads to higher exploitation amirsadri et al 2018 therefore β must be selected carefully to find a proper balance between high exploration and exploitation previous studies jensi and jiji 2016 amirsadri et al 2018 recommend selecting β within the range of 0 2 3 2 proposed methods in this section we will describe the proposed model for the groundwater modeling problem in depth the proposed model is known as aaeo mlp and comprises two parts augmented artificial ecosystem optimization and the multi layer perceptron network the proposed aaeo algorithm will be described in detail in the following section 3 2 1 proposed augmented artificial ecosystem optimization aaeo algorithm while the aeo algorithm is noted for its strong global search ability zhao et al 2019 once the method approaches the near optimal solution it is characterized by a low convergence rate due to a higher exploration rate in production and consumption stages compared to the exploitation rate in the decomposition stage hence in this paper we use the levy flight trajectory and gaussian normal random walks to augment the exploration global search and exploitation local search ability of the aeo algorithm resulting in augmented aeo our suggested optimizer aaeo uses the step sizes generated by the levy distribution to explore and take advantage of the search area upgraded consumption stage exploration phase in this phase before determining whether the selected agent updates its position based on herbivore omnivore or carnivore it will have a 50 chance to update by one of three living organisms and a 50 chance to update its position by our proposed levy flight trajectory based on eq 17 17 x i g 1 x i g s t e p g 1 x i g x b e s t recalling eq 12 16 the step size s t e p g 1 is generated by levy distribution with β value randomized in range of 1 2 using the β in the range 1 2 ensures that the agent has more chance on a big move to be able to escape from local optima leading to higher exploration meanwhile x b e s t is used to guide the agent in the direction of the optimal solution upgraded decomposition stage exploitation phase as can be seen from eq 10 the updating position of the current agent is limited to one dimension of a random number by a factor of e besides the unnecessary weight parameters e and h lead to unexpected behaviors in this process meaning it can produce a small jump or large jump depending on the outcome of these parameters to stabilize this phase as the exploitation process we re designed the updating position eq 10 and proposed to use eq 18 instead in which unnecessary parameters e and h are removed and the factor e is replaced by a gaussian distribution vector of d dimension through this modification the local search ability is strengthened in every dimension of the search space 18 x i g 1 x b e s t n o r m a l 0 1 d x b e s t x i g where is element wise multiplication beside the implementation of gaussian random walk to further enhance the local search of aeo we propose to use the levy flight trajectory with a small step size in this stage a simple mechanism as the consumption phase is employed in which the currently selected agent will have a 50 chance to update its position through the improved decomposition process eq 18 and a 50 chance to update its position by the levy trajectory eq 19 with β value randomized in range of 0 1 using the β in the range 0 1 ensures that the agent exploits promising solutions near the current global best solution i e higher exploitation meanwhile x b e s t is operated to guide the agent in the direction of the optimal solution 19 x g 1 i x b e s t s t e p g 1 x b e s t x g i thus by upgrading both the consumption and decomposition stage through the levy flight trajectory and gaussian random walk the proposed aaeo algorithm is quipped with improved local and global search capabilities making the method better at finding the optimal solution and accelerating the convergence rate when compared to aeo moreover the decomposition stage is reworked to concentrate on the exploitation only leading to the balance between both phases finally the pseudo code of aaeo is provided in algorithm 1 3 2 2 summary of the proposed model aaeo mlp to build a forecasting model for gwl we propose to use aaeo combined with the mlp network the complete aaeo mlp model for gwl is shown in fig 3 there are three phases in our model including data preprocessing modeling and evaluation data preprocessing in this phase we first collect the monthly measurements of cumulative rainfall mean air temperature tidal height and gwl from different wells the data is then preprocessed with quality assessment and cleaning steps then we split data into training and testing datasets the training dataset is used for the feature selection step and modeling phase meanwhile the testing dataset is used for the evaluation phase in this study the mutual information based mi method is utilized to select the best features for the model mutual information measures the entropy drops under the condition of the target value its score falls in the range of 0 1 the higher value the closer connection between the current feature and the target which suggests that we should take this feature to train the model once the appropriate time lag for each explanatory variable has been determined the collection of the time lagged explanatory variables is considered as inputs to the aaeo mlp to forecast monthly gwl at a lead time of one month ahead i e the output variable modeling in this process aaeo mlp will learn from the training dataset and produce the best model for the evaluation phase the general flow of this stage is as follows the mlp weights and biases parameters are encoded as decision variables a solution an objective function is selected e g mse and the aaeo algorithm is used to tune the mlp parameters when the maximum number of generations is reached in the aaeo algorithm the optimal parameter vector is stored and used to evaluate the aaeo mlp on an independent test set evaluation phase evaluation in this phase the trained aaeo mlp model is evaluated on the testing dataset with a wide number of performance metrics commonly adopted in hydrology these metrics are mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse pearson s correlation index r kling gupta efficiency kge and a20 index a20 besides normalized version of nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse was also used these indices are computed as follows 20 mae y y ˆ i 1 n y ˆ y n 21 rmse y y ˆ i 1 n y ˆ y 2 n 22 nse y y ˆ 1 i 0 n 1 y i y i ˆ 2 i 0 n 1 y i μ y nnse y y ˆ 1 2 nse y y ˆ 23 a20 y y ˆ m 20 n 24 r

the total number of data m 20 is the number of samples with a value of rate observed value predicted value between 0 8 and 1 2 note that a predictive model with mae of 0 eq 20 rmse of 0 eq 21 nnse of

description the study region of dakshina kannada district karnataka india is characterized by a humid and tropical climate with the western ghats mountain ranges in the east and the arabian sea in the west the region receives about 4000 mm of annual rainfall out of which the southwest monsoon june september contributes 70 to 80 of the total rainfall and the remaining comes from the northeast monsoon during october and november despite receiving a large amount of rainfall from the southwest monsoon in some years there is rationing of water during the summer season march may if sufficient rainfall is not received during the northeast monsoon agriculture being the main sector of the region uses 75 of irrigated water from groundwater sources to irrigate commonly grown crops such as areca nut cashew nut coconut and paddy lathashri and mahesha 2016 uttarwar et al 2020 the most predominant soil type in the region is red lateritic which results in the existence of unconfined aquifers 12 30 m depth with varying texture from fine to granular formation underlain by a fault of gneiss lathashri and mahesha 2016 such type of soil renders the aquifers to be of high permeability leading to the loss of water in the form of surface and subsurface runoff several monitoring wells are maintained in the district by the department of mines and geology government of karnataka india the monthly depth to groundwater table dgwt data were collected for two observation wells at ganjimutt from 1989 to 2010 and surathkal from 1989 to 2012 fig 4 the dgwt is used to represent the groundwater level in this study the details of the two wells are given in table 2 the wells have been selected with one far away 17 3 km from the coast and the other close to it 1 km from previous studies by mahesha et al 2012 uttarwar et al 2020 the gwl at these wells are known to be influenced by tidal height th though the influence of th on gwl is normally expected for a short duration i e days as reported in a study by yoon et al 2011 the conditional distribution of gwl given th even at a monthly scale has shown to have significant dependence structure in a study by uttarwar et al 2020 for this study monthly long term th data was collected from the permanent service for mean sea level psmsl daily gauge based gridded precipitation 0 25 x 0 25 from india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 was collected and then converted to monthly data derived by summing daily data for the period 1989 2012 the monthly mean air temperature for each month was derived by summing daily mean air temperature divided by the number of days of a particular month srivastava et al 2009 previous measurements of monthly precipitation air temperature tidal height and groundwater level were considered as explanatory variables while gwl at a lead time of 1 month was considered as the target response variable there was a total of 56 measurements of the explanatory and target variables that were used to develop and evaluate the different models 4 2 feature selection the mutual information mi measure was used to select the best inputs i e lagged versions of the explanatory variables mentioned above for developing the gwl forecasting models at the two wells ganjimutt and surathkal fig 5 shows mi scores for each explanatory variable rainfall r cm tidal height th m mean air temperature t c and groundwater level gwl m considered for the model development in the graph each dot or circle represents the mi value of t th lag of corresponding explanatory variables blue rainfall orange tidal height blue mean air temperature and red gwl all the mi scores were obtained between gwl at time t and the corresponding lag of explanatory variables after manually inspecting the figures optimal input combinations were generated to develop the best model for each well in this study a threshold of mi scores exceeding 0 5 and 0 4 were used for ganjimutt and surathkal wells respectively as an example to obtain optimal inputs of rainfall r from the corresponding mi of ganjimutt well the mi values between r and gwl values at lags 0 1 exceed the limit of 0 5 therefore these values are used for inputs to the models to forecast gwl at the current time t 0 the other optimal lags were also determined similarly 4 3 model comparison to assess the performance of the proposed aaeo mlp model for the monthly gwl modeling problem first we compare aeo mlp to aaeo mlp to demonstrate that the aaeo proposed method outperforms the traditional aeo algorithm in terms of optimization ability second we picked 16 featured algorithms below from various categories of nature inspired algorithms as nfl theory expresses there is no single best algorithm for all problems nfl theory different algorithms are developed for different issues as a result the proposed aaeo must be compared to other algorithms in different categories to demonstrate superior performance note that all materials and source code

modified artificial ecosystem optimization 16 eaeo mlp eid et al 2020 enhanced artificial ecosystem optimization 4 4 parameter configurations for the neural network the architecture included 1 input layer 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer the activation function in hidden and output layers was set to the elu selvin et al 2017 fu et al 2016 the input number of nodes in the input layer was set equal to the number of features selected from section 4 2 the number of neurons in the hidden layer was tuned from the number of inputs to 1 twice the number of inputs aljarah et al 2018 mirjalili et al 2014 the number of neurons in the output layer was equal to 1 the metaheuristic algorithms are implemented using the open source python library mealpy thieu and mirjalili 2022 with the maximum generation g m a x and the population size p s were set to 1000 and 50 respectively for all the hho eo fbio cgo aeo iaeo maeo eaeo and our proposed aaeo algorithms required the specification of only g m a x and p s parameters however other metaheuristic algorithms require the specification of additional parameters we used trial and error method to find the best parameters for each algorithm and the best parameters are noted in table 3 5 results and discussion we present the experimental outcomes from two different scenarios in this section the first scenario examines the findings of the aaeo mlp model to the results of the classical aeo mlp model the second scenario shows the comparison results of the aaeo mlp model and the previously mentioned metaheuristics algorithm based mlp network the three main aspects discussed in both scenarios are prediction ability model convergence and model stability 5 1 performance analysis of aaeo mlp versus aeo mlp 5 1 1 prediction assessment we evaluated the prediction performance of aaeo mlp versus aeo mlp using six metrics namely mae rmse r nnse kge and a20 for two monthly gwl datasets each model is executed 10 times based on its most effective parameters the mean values of each metric and each model are recorded table 4 shows the mean of each metric of each model for the dataset of both ganjimutt gan and surathkal sur wells table 4 shows that aaeo mlp outperforms aeo mlp in both ganjimutt and surathkal with respect to all metrics for example in the ganjimutt well the values of metrics mae and rmse for the unseen testing data of aaeo mlp are 0 897 and 1 274 compared to metrics of aeo mlp 1 038 and 1 425 respectively in the surathkal well aaeo mlp beats aeo mlp in the metrics r nnse and a20 with corresponding values 0 806 0 714 and 0 827 versus 0 779 0 693 and 0 819 as can be seen our proposed model aaeo mlp fits well in the training phase and has good skills in predicting gwl in the testing phase the reason is that the upgraded strategy with levy flight trajectory and gaussian random walk in exploration and exploitation improve the aaeo s improved optimizing ability consequently it helps aaeo mlp to obtain optimal results better than aeo the observed versus predicted gwl values are visualized via line plots in fig 6 the line plots show that the aaeo mlp predicted values closer to its observed ground truth data than aeo mlp in both wells all the applied models could not capture some gwl values especially the extreme ones the limited number of data can explain it because we used monthly intervals and more data may improve the models accuracy the other important issue which can be derived from fig 6 that the models are more successful in simulating and predicting the gwl of ganjimutt well compared to surathkal this can be explained by the lower mutual information scores between the influential input variables and gwl for the surathkal see fig 5 5 1 2 model convergence metaheuristic algorithms do not arrive at a given optimal solution in a few iterations even for linear problems however for a highly complex aquifer system where the groundwater level variation is highly non linear the need for understanding convergence rates is of high importance when such algorithms run over hundreds of iterations such algorithms converge based on a stopping criterion in our study the training dataset with mse as a loss function which is the acceptable error one like to achieve or the maximum number of training iterations calibration budget fig 7 shows the training loss of aaeo mlp versus aeo mlp in both wells it is evident that the aaeo mlp model converges to the minimal error faster than aeo mlp and aeo mlp cannot reach the minimal error level as aaeo mlp in the last generations for example at the ganjimutt well in a few initial generations i e five epochs the aeo mlp has better mse loss due to the aaeo mlp taking time to explore more the search space it will ensure aaeo mlp can jump out of local optimal after 25 epochs aeo mlp stops reducing the loss and aaeo mlp keeps finding better results with smaller losses it shows that applying the levy flight trajectory in both the exploration and exploitation phases of aaeo makes the algorithm archive more balanced in explore and exploit ability when finding optimal value 5 1 3 model stability metaheuristic algorithms are stochastic thus each model run will yield slightly different results that should on average converge to the optimal solution given a sufficient number of training iterations therefore stability indicates how much individual runs vary in terms of the objective function with the number of training iterations held constant a higher level of stability lower variability among different runs is typically seen as a good quality of a metaheuristic algorithm to compare the stability of the various algorithms each model was run 10 times and different performance metrics were compared to one another on the test set the standard deviation std values of each metric and each model were recorded table 5 shows the standard deviation of each metric of each model for the dataset of both ganjimutt gan and surathkal sur wells the standard deviation of the performance metrics represents how far each data point is from the mean value the lower deviation on all counts of performance metrics is an indication that a model performed quite stable whereas a higher value is attributed to the fluctuating performance of the model from table 5 considering the test dataset aaeo mlp outperforms aeo mlp according to all of the metrics in particular the aaeo mlp has standard deviation value at 0 02 for mae metric meanwhile the corresponding value for the aeo mlp is 0 095 we also visualize the distribution of metrics mae rmse nnse after ten trials of aaeo mlp and aeo mlp based on the boxplot shown in fig 8 a box plot box and whisker plot is a chart that depicts the five data distributions minimum value min first quartile q1 median median third quartile q3 and maximum value max as a result a model that provides the metric distribution in a narrow range can indicate its stability characteristics from fig 8 it is clear that our proposed aaeo significantly improved the persistence compared to aeo when optimizing the mlp network using the levy flight approach and gaussian random walk in both the exploration and exploitation phase is well justified and particularly useful in improving one of the critical characteristics of the aaeo 5 2 performance analysis of aaeo mlp versus other metaheuristic algorithm based mlp 5 2 1 prediction assessment in this scenario our proposed model aaeo mlp is compared with 16 other well known models for solving monthly gwl prediction problems same as the first test we evaluate models using 6 metrics that include mae rmse r nnse kge and a20 for two datasets each model is executed ten times based on its most effective parameters and these metric values are recorded table 6 shows the mean of each model metric for the dataset of ganjimutt and surathkal wells for ganjimutt well table 6 shows that only efo mlp and fbio mlp beat our proposed model aaeo mlp on four metrics mae rmse r and nnse in the training set however for unseen data the aaeo mlp outperforms all 16 models concerning almost all metrics significantly aaeo mlp outperforms all the other variants of aeo such as iaeo mlp eaeo mlp and maeo mlp in both the training and testing phases for example the values of metrics rmse nnse and a20 for the unseen testing data of aaeo mlp are 1 274 0 736 and 0 622 compared to metrics of iaeo mlp 1 438 0 686 and 0 558 eaeo mlp 1 438 0 686 and 0 562 and maeo mlp 1 398 0 698 and 0 558 respectively these results indicate that aaeo mlp as a newly developed model in this field of gwl modeling can provide higher forecasting performance compared to other predictive models for ganjimutt well for surathkal well table 6 indicates that only fbio mlp beat aaeo mlp on 5 metrics mae rmse r nnse and kge in the training dataset however in the testing dataset our proposed aaeo mlp outperforms fbio mlp and all other models on all metrics it once again proved that the aaeo mlp fits nicely in the training phase and has good skills in predicting gwl in the testing phase 5 2 2 model convergence we show the convergence chart of aaeo mlp versus other metaheuristic based mlp networks in fig 9 it is evident that the aaeo mlp and fbio mlp models converge to the minimal error faster than the other models e g hho mlp chio mlp and the cgo mlp could not reach the minimal error in particular at ganjimutt well aaeo fbio eo eaeo and maeo algorithms after 40 iterations converged extremely quickly to almost the same error 0 017 after that only aaeo mlp and fbio mlp and maeo mlp can go down further however after 500 iterations maeo mlp stops decreasing meanwhile aaeo mlp and fbio mlp keep going down a little bit further the same event can be observed at surathkal well but after 50 iterations maeo mlp converges faster than aaeo mlp at the error of 0 007 however after 250 iterations the aaeo mlp outperforms maeo mlp by reducing the error thus it is apparent that our proposed model aaeo mlp dramatically improves the convergence properties of aeo and results in quicker convergence and helps find a better objective function value this is because the levy flight trajectory was used during the exploration phase it enables aaeo mlp to escape local optimal that maeo mlp cannot resulting in better optimal search than maeo mlp and other models 5 2 3 model stability in this section the standard deviation values of 6 metrics after 10 experiment trials of the proposed model aaeo mlp versus 16 other well known models are recorded in table 7 in addition we also present the box plot of all compared models in figs 10 and 11 table 5 clearly indicates that when considering the test dataset the best performing models with the lowest standard deviation are aaeo mlp mvo mlp eo mlp and ga mlp meanwhile pso mlp hho mlp and chio mlp are the models with the highest volatility in particular the aaeo mlp has an standard deviation value of 0 02 for the mae metric meanwhile the corresponding values for the iaeo mlp eaeo mlp and maeo mlp are 0 056 0 08 and 0 034 respectively as shown in fig 10 at ganjimutt well for metric mae the most steady model is aaeo mlp followed by the mvo mlp maeo mlp and ga mlp aaeo mlp is also the second stabilized model in the rmse metric after mvo mlp and the third persistent model in the nnse metric after the mvo mlp and ga mlp the two most erratic models in terms of the mae metric are pso mlp and ssa mlp meanwhile pso mlp and aeo mlp are the most varying models in both rmse and nnse metrics similarly at surathkal well fig 11 the aaeo mlp and eo mlp are the most steady models in terms of three metrics mae rmse and nnse the de mlp pso mlp chio mlp and eaeo mlp are the most inconsistent models based on the results of the preceding analyses it can be stated that our improved strategy with levy flight trajectory and gaussian random walk assist the aeo algorithm in finding optimal results better than other metaheuristic based mlp networks furthermore the balance between the exploration and exploitation phases is maintained resulting in aaeo s extreme stability 6 conclusions the present study proposed an improved ai technique augmented artificial ecosystem optimization based multi layer perceptron aaeo mlp to develop a gwl prediction model the proposed model aaeo mlp is built based on a novel augmented version of the aeo algorithm and the traditional mlp network in aaeo the levy flight technique and gaussian random walk are introduced in the exploration and exploitation phases to improve the optimizing ability of aeo the aaeo mlp model is tested on two time series 1989 2012 datasets collected at two wells in india various explanatory variables such as monthly cumulative precipitation

model s convergence and stability are also covered the results indicated that the proposed model aaeo mlp leads to better model performance reasonable convergence and higher stability than all other
