10345,both sensible and latent heat fluxes are important components in the land surface energy budget and accurately estimating them on kilometer scale are important for understanding and modeling local hydro meteorological process scintillometry could provide kilometer scale averaged turbulent heat fluxes and has been used as ground based remote sensing for estimating surface energy and water budget this research compared heat fluxes obtained using an optical microwave scintillometer oms and an eddy covariance system ec over a typical temperate deciduous forest in hilly area northern china the observation period mainly represents growing season from april to october 2018 we estimated the sensible and latent heat fluxes using both the two wavelength method and the bichromatic correlation method and the ec measurements were used as a benchmark the results show the sensible heat fluxes from oms showed 2 higher than ec whilst the latent heat fluxes from oms showed around 10 higher than ec changes in hydrological conditions or footprints have no significant effects on the measured turbulent fluxes from oms we also founded that there are slightly differences between fluxes derived by the two wavelength method and the bichromatic correlation method due to assumed r tq value based on these results we conclude that oms can be a reliable approach to measure kilometer scale surface turbulent heat fluxes over the hilly area and its ability to estimate kilometer area sensible and latent heat fluxes looks promising keywords sensible heat fluxes latent heat fluxes two wavelength method structure parameters scintillometer 1 introduction sensible and latent heat fluxes form the turbulent heat flux contribution to the land surface energy balance latent heat flux being proportional to evapotranspiration determines local and global of water balance the kilometer scale surface energy budget is crucial to meteorological and hydrological modelling since it determines the exchanges of heat and water between the surface and the atmosphere accurate measurements of energy fluxes are important to improve hydrologic and climatic models and the demand for reliable kilometer scale energy flux information is increasing a state of the art approach for monitoring surface fluxes is the eddy covariance ec technique especially for the regional scales of hundred meters it has been widely used in surface flux observation networks worldwide baldocchi et al 2000 a combination of several ec towers together can provide a kilometer scale surface turbulent heat fluxes which was comparable to pixel size data sets such as numerical simulation results or reanalysis compared with ec method a ground based remote sensing technique scintillometry can offer another option to monitor the kilometer scale turbulent fluxes moreover scintillometry is more suitable for long term validation of remotely sensed products and verification of model simulation results due to its large area of observation kohsiek and herben 1983 green et al 2001 de bruin 2002 mei sun yee et al 2015 the near infrared and microwave wavelengths were combined when using scintillometry to derive surface heat fluxes the air temperature t fluctuations dominate the received signal at near infrared wavelengths and the microwave wavelengths are more sensitive to humidity q fluctuations therefore the temperature structure parameter c t 2 and the humidity structure parameter c q 2 can be derived from the refractive index structure parameter c n 2 a parameter for different wavelengths λi then fluxes of sensible and latent water vapor heat can be derived by using the two wavelength or bichromatic correlation method base on the monin obukhov similarity theory andreas 1989 compared with ec method scintillometry is more depended on the applicability of similarity theory therefore it is useful for homogeneous underlying surface previous studies have compared scintillometry with ec meijninger et al 2006 shown that sensible heat flux h from scintillometry about 7 higher than from ec and latent heat flux le about 26 higher than ec results the energy balance of scintillometry was 0 86 ward et al 2015 has pointed out that le from scintillometry is about 14 higher than from ec le form scintillometry higher than from ec and the energy balance closure of scintillometry larger than ec is also be founded by meijninger et al 2002 the two wavelength technique has been used over various landscapes such as vineyard green et al 2000 mixed farmland meijninger et al 2002 plains mei et al 2015 urban landscapes ward et al 2015 forests isabelle et al 2020 within these studies the correlation coefficient between the temperature and humidity fluctuations r tq is always set as fixed values typically r tq 0 8 1 however this assumption is not always the case because the turbulent diffusivity for heat and humidity can be different hill 1989 and meijninger et al 2002 founded that r tq varies from 0 77 to 0 95 in their research based on this consideration the bichromatic correlation method outlined by lüdi et al 2005 uses the correlation between the optical and microwave signals to determine the surface fluxes without a constant value of r tq it has shown that the bichromatic correlation method and ec ﬂuxes yields good correlation r 2 up to 0 82 in hilly forests isabelle et al 2020 nevertheless it should be keeping in mind that any scintillometer based surface turbulent measurements are based on semi empirical relationship its results still need to be verified across ecosystems that differ in landscape and hydrological conditions water resources are scarce in the hilly area of northern china and precipitation is mainly concentrated in the growing season in these area land surface turbulent flux varies significantly corresponding to change in hydrological conditions with the help of an observation experiment based on an optical microwave scintillometer oms and an ec system this study tries to get a kilometer scale surface turbulent heat fluxes over a hilly area in henan province china to achieve this goal the applicability of scintillometry mainly based on a comparison with ec observation need to be ascertain first this study was expected to provide insights and reduce uncertainty for utilizing scintillometry measurements over terrain regions 2 material

however before being stored in memory card the raw data were smoothed using a running mean filter with a default of 10 s and the variance was calculated with a 1 min resolution even though there are still some spikes left in the variance data to remove these spikes the value x i with in the variance data which deviates more than 3 5 times the standard deviation σ j from the mean value on every 5 min was characterized as a spike and removed højstrup 1993 thus the structure parameters were initially calculated at 1 min intervals and then they were averaged into 30 min blocks the data from april 27 to october 24 2018 are used in this study the 1 min records were then proceeded as following steps the optical data were rejected based on theoretical arguments which have revealed that saturation occurred when c n b l s 2 exceeds 0 193d 5 3 λ 1 3 l 8 3 kleissl et al 2010a 2010b less than 0 01 of our data suffered from saturation the mws system was not affected by saturation data were also removed when there were drops in signal intensity due to power failure rainfall higher relative humidity 90 or maintenance the 30 min averaged fluxes lower than 100 w m 2 or larger than 700 w m 2 were also removed 2 4 2 eddy covariance the data from the ec system were processed using eddypro version 6 2 0 to calculate the average fluxes at 30 min intervals the processing involved spike detection lag removal correction relative to the vertical wind component based on covariance maximization sonic virtual temperature correction double coordinate rotation and a wpl density correction webb et al 1980 we also considered the impact of flux storage and the storage fluxes of the sensible and latent heat were estimated from concentrations and were based on a 1 point profile produced by eddypro to ensure the quality of the ec data the final data record was deleted if it met the following criteria 1 evidence of rainfall and maintenance issues 2 a friction velocity of u 0 15 m s 1 or 3 implausible values 100 or 700 w m 2 2 4 3 soil heat flux the method of calculating the soil heat storage by observing the average soil temperature above buried deep z r m through the tcav average soil thermocouple tcav manual 2006 combining with the measured soil heat flux at z r m obtains the surface soil heat flux g 0 w m 2 referred to as the tcav method the depth z r of the buried heat flux

δts is the change of leaf temperature per half hour and the surface temperature ts was derived by the longwave radiation fluxes based on the stefan boltzmann law as follows 20 t s r l ε σ 1 4 where σ

distance pointing against the average horizontal wind direction the crosswind wind distance and the measurement height respectively d y x y is the gaussian crosswind distribution function of the lateral dispersion and f y x z m is the crosswind integrated footprint the source area of scintillometry was computed following liu et al 2011 by combing the kormann and meixner 2001 model with the scintillometer path weighting as detailed in the oms manual rpg manual 2014 22 f o m s x y z m x 1 x 2 w x f x x y y z m d x where x1 x2 are the locations of oms transmitter and receiver respectively

23 o f p f o m s e c f o m s 100 where f oms ec is the total area of overlaps between oms and ec footprint and f oms is the total area of oms footprint we chose an area of 2 km 2 km with a 20 m resolution as the total calculation area 3 results 3 1 weather conditions the synoptic background during the observation period are plotted in fig 3 the air temperature ta varied from 8 c to 36 c and the highest temperature occurred during june however ta was usually less than 30 c during the study period net radiation began to increase from may and reached its annual maximum in july most days net radiation exceeded 700 w m 2 precipitation occurred frequently from june to august and concentrated in june and july the relative humidity rh and soil water content swc increased with precipitation rh ranges from 12 to 100 and rh is mostly greater than 40 during the precipitation period the changes in the soil water content at 5 cm were very abrupt while those at 20 cm occurred smoothly it is also to see that precipitation in june and july increased significantly with total of 413 2 mm accounting for 77 of total precipitation during the entire growing season the rainfall in september is 98 mm basing on the precipitation pattern we defined june july and september as wet period while other months as dry period 3 2 comparison between oms and ec the turbulent heat fluxes from oms were compared to ec fluxes fig 4 two kinds of h from oms h bc and h tw were a bit greater than ec h ec for about 1 2 compared with h le obtained from oms were 10 greater than that from ec le ec using ec as a bench mark then the bc method eq 7 intend to overestimate the surface heat flux than the tw method eq 5 in generally the results from scintillometer show quite good accordance with that from ec in dry and wet seasons the diurnal variations of turbulent heat fluxes given by oms was shown fig 5 it is obvious that fluxes from oms and ec showed similar diurnal patterns just like rn fluxes became higher due to the increased radiative input and the maximum of each flux was appeared around 13 00 it is also can be find that h form oms was generally closer to h ec in both dry and wet periods moreover it worth noting that h from oms was slightly smaller than h ec in the morning during wet period while h larger than h ec in afternoon during both periods and the biggest differences are 49 92 w m 2 and 63 06 w m 2 h bc h ec respectively compared to h differences of le between oms and ec were larger than these of h the biggest differences were 52 15 w m 2 and 71 37 w m 2 le bc le ec during the two periods le from oms was higher than rn after 16 30 indicating a potential overestimation of le a plausible explanation for the smaller h in the morning during the period could be the enhanced evapotranspiration generally the differences in the h from oms and ec are well correlated with the magnitude of h ec in both the dry and wet periods while le obtained from oms exhibits larger than le ec fluxes from oms and ec during both dry and wet periods were compared in fig 6 relationships of h between oms and ec in dry and wet period were shown as slightly higher slopes and good correlations r2 0 7 with intercepts of 15 w m 2 h showed much scatter when values of oms larger than 400 w m 2 this would cause the intercepts of h indicating that there is larger difference between oms and ec when there is larger h le from oms were higher than from ec the slope is 1 10 with quite different correlations and intercepts during the two periods the intercepts of le during dry period were higher than these during wet period and correlations showed better in wet period than in dry period this can be explained by that the le from oms were larger than from ec overall and there are still scatters in higher fluxes when evapotranspiration is not dominated it reveals that the capability of oms to measure both sensible and latent heat fluxes are stable and changes in hydrological process have no effects on this during study period the leaf area index lai in our area was typically ranged from 1 to 3 m2 m 2 ornl daac 2018 myneni park 2015 while the lai ranged from 0 6 to 1 m2 m 2 in october which is the growth ending the leaves are gradually falling changes in lai also have no effects on the fluxes measured by oms even during the october relationship between h bc and h ec showed slope of 1 03 and intercept of 12 56 w m 2 r2 0 70 and relationship between le bc and le ec showed slope of 1 12 and intercept of 7 32 w m 2 r2 0 73 3 3 footprints of oms and ec the wind speeds and directions during the observation period left and the source areas of the fluxes from each system right are shown in fig 7 the predominant winds at the site were from the northeast and the wind speed usually ranged from 1 to 4 m s 1 but on rare occasions it reached 7 m s 1 the wind speed from the northeast was often larger than that from other directions the 90 contribution areas reached about 310 m and 700 m to the north and about 220 m and 380 m to the south for the ec and oms measurements fig 7 respectively we also compared the fluxes from the two different methods when 90 contribution area of ec is completely covered by source area of oms referring fig 7 and results showed in fig 8 the slope of regressed line between h from oms and ec is 1 05 while the slopes of le were little difference 1 07 for the tw method and 1 09 for the bc method monthly averaged footprint overlap percent reached up to 55 at october and there is smallest percentage of 28 at july fig 9 however there is no clear trend in the difference of heat fluxes between oms and ec as footprint overlap increased difference of h between oms and ec showed a positive correlation with a slope of 0 07 with intercept of 1 93 w m 2 and r2 of 0 96 with condition of rn 50 w m 2 and the difference of le showed a slope of 0 10 with intercept of 3 57 w m 2 and r2 of 0 96 fig 10 it reveals that fluxes derived from oms do not change with footprints and the difference between oms and ec become lager when there are higher fluxes 3 4 energy balance closure energy balance closure was estimated by plotting the sum of turbulent heat fluxes against the available energy calculated by net radiation minus soil surface heat flux and the storage term of the forest canopy rn g 0 s with the 30 min averaged fluxes g 0 and s calculated by eqs 18 and 19 the energy balance derived from the ec has a closure of 0 81 fig 11 with intercepts of 11 85 w m 2 the energy imbalance of ec is widely detected in the field measurements including our research wilson et al 2002 suggests that the mismatch of footprint for each energy component is one of the main reasons for the energy imbalance rn and gs measured at the tower site are at much smaller scales and they cannot represent the same scale of ec or even the scintillometry in our research this would be one reason for the imbalance in our site secondly energy balance could improve 5 or 10 in forests when considering the canopy heat storage michiles and gielow 2008 liu et al 2011 the heat storage of forest canopy was estimated by an empirical method this would also be contributed to poor energy additionally the uncaptured larger eddies and secondary circulations in the complex terrain would be one of the reasons for the imbalance of energy mauder et al 2007 foken 2008 however the energy balance of scintillometry was 1 03 with intercepts of 19 46 w m 2 and 18 29 w m 2 for bc and tw respectively indicating that scintillometry in our measurements gives overestimated fluxes 4 discussion the results of the turbulent fluxes were obtained by applying scintillometry to a complex landscape at the several kilometer scale our results show that the trends of both the sensible and latent heat fluxes obtained using oms are broadly consistent with the ec results h from the scintillometry is similar to h ec while le from scintillometry is 11 higher than le ec this is broadly consistent with the results of previous studies involving two wavelength scintillometry previous studies have shown that the sensible heat fluxes are about 7 higher than the ec fluxes and the latent heat fluxes are 10 26 higher than the ec results when different r tq values are assumed meijninger et al 2006 ward et al 2015 yee et al 2015 isabelle et al 2020 lüdi et al 2005 pointed out that r tq is large and positive i e high correlation between temperature and humidity during the day and negative i e anti correlation between temperature and humidity during the night moreover r tq is thought to be a useful indicator of the violation of most hill 1989 andreas et al 1998 and the irregular changes in r tq during the night imply that the use of similarity functions may be inappropriate at these times we assumed that r tq 1 for unstable conditions and r tq 1 for stable conditions in this research studies also showed that r tq 1 is rare and often ranged 0 5 0 9 meijninger et al 2006 ward et al 2015 in our study r tq fluctuates between 0 8 and 0 at night and commonly varies smoothly from 0 6 to 0 9 during the day which indicates that the violation of most is small lüdi et al 2005 and oms is suitable for our observation need moreover it can be found that fluxes estimated by the bc method were slightly higher than from the tw method the reason can be explained by the values of assumed r tq which mentioned in the previous paragraph with the assumed values the structure parameters of temperature and humidity in the example days of dry 2018 05 05 and wet 2018 07 12 from oms and ec are generally following similar trends to each other fig 12 previous study also reported that c t 2 and c q 2 show good identities between ec and oms kohsiek and herben 1983 meijninger et al 2006 ward et al 2015 however in our study c t 2 and c q 2 from bc are often higher than from tw method in two example days this would lead to the fluxes from oms using bc were higher than using tw method we tried r tq 0 6 0 8 and found that c t 2 and c q 2 from tw method are much closer to the bc when the r tq with a smaller values especially for c q 2 indicating that the r tq values would be lead to deviations of fluxes another possible explanation is the effect of tower vibrations the transmitters were mounted at top of a tall tower sometimes subject to vibrations contaminating the measurements of oms vibrations would cause biased on the third term c n o m s 2 eq 7 and c n m w s 2 due to the millimeter wave length while assumed r tq values can avoid the biased on c n o m s 2 it will filter the calculation of c t 2 and c q 2 and have influence on the fluxes results von randow et al 2008 also found that tower vibrations need to be corrected in oms measurement however it is difficult to do this in our research due to unsaved scintillation voltage time series and unmeasured tower vibration since the ec observations were used as benchmark in our research and the effect of the storage flux was also considered the turbulent fluxes measured using oms were overestimated although the scintillometer path weighting function indicates that the maximum sensitivity is toward the center of the path hoedjes et al 2007 liu et al 2013 and we intentionally located the ec station near the middle of the path oms still has a much larger source area than the ec evans 2009 also showed that the correlation of the scintillometer fluxes with the aggregation of several ec fluxes was much better than the correlation with the individual ec fluxes the different source areas of the instruments should also be noted we also analyzed heat fluxes with condition of the source area of ec was overlaps with of oms sensible heat fluxes are well quantified by the scintillometry while the latent heat fluxes are overestimated fig 8 although the study area is basically covered by trees fig 1 the difference of surface temperature due to the heterogeneity would also contribute to the difference in heat fluxes liu et al 2011 malone et al 2014 suggest that poor energy closure may be partly due to the underestimation of le and h and zhao et al 2018 replaced h observed by the ec with h obtained from the near infrared scintillometer the energy balance was improved by 6 scintillometry emit certain wavelengths travel between transmitters and receivers separated by a few kilometers and fluctuations in the intensity of received signals can be linked to turbulence kleissl et al 2010a 2010b it has advantage to obtained the information of turbulence in both larger and smaller eddies with much higher sampling frequency on the contrary larger eddies cannot be captured by ec on the typical averaging period of 30 min whereas 60 min was found more appropriate for forest ecosystem berger et al 2001 although oms show certain advantages in observations energy balance of scintillometry is higher than ec in our research we attribute this to the overestimation of le from oms however the difference between scintillometry and ec measurements still widely exist further explored on the discrepancies in different ecosystems may potentially improve the measurements of turbulent heat fluxes from the above we conclude that measurements from scintillometry and ec still showed an imbalance and this would cause the difference between the two method and the difference between two calculation of structure parameter by scintillometry tw and bc indicates that it should be careful when used a fixed r tq value generally our research shows that the results of the scintillometry and the ec measurements are in good agreement which indicates that the scintillometry is a reliable system for measuring energy fluxes over non uniform terrain 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of a commercially available optical microwave scintillometer oms system to measure the turbulent fluxes over a non uniform land surface using the two wavelength and bichromatic correlation methods results show that 1 both sensible heat fluxes from oms showed slightly higher than ec whilst the latent heat fluxes from oms showed around 10 higher than ec 2 the capability of oms to measure both sensible and latent heat fluxes are stable changes in hydrological process or footprints have no effects on this 3 oms in our study showed over closure of energy balance due to the overestimation of turbulent we concluded that oms can be a reliable approach to measure kilometer scale surface turbulent heat fluxes although discrepancies still widely exist between oms and ec measurements the reasons for the discrepancies still need to be further explored which would improve our understanding of the two techniques and may improve the energy balance closure in measurements the study also shows that the difference between two wavelength method and bichromatic correlation method still exist due to the limitation of scintillometry more testing on scintillometry especially the derivation of latent heat fluxes across a wider range of conditions are definitely needed and it is important to make sure vibrations of the mountings are minimized

10345,both sensible and latent heat fluxes are important components in the land surface energy budget and accurately estimating them on kilometer scale are important for understanding and modeling local hydro meteorological process scintillometry could provide kilometer scale averaged turbulent heat fluxes and has been used as ground based remote sensing for estimating surface energy and water budget this research compared heat fluxes obtained using an optical microwave scintillometer oms and an eddy covariance system ec over a typical temperate deciduous forest in hilly area northern china the observation period mainly represents growing season from april to october 2018 we estimated the sensible and latent heat fluxes using both the two wavelength method and the bichromatic correlation method and the ec measurements were used as a benchmark the results show the sensible heat fluxes from oms showed 2 higher than ec whilst the latent heat fluxes from oms showed around 10 higher than ec changes in hydrological conditions or footprints have no significant effects on the measured turbulent fluxes from oms we also founded that there are slightly differences between fluxes derived by the two wavelength method and the bichromatic correlation method due to assumed r tq value based on these results we conclude that oms can be a reliable approach to measure kilometer scale surface turbulent heat fluxes over the hilly area and its ability to estimate kilometer area sensible and latent heat fluxes looks promising keywords sensible heat fluxes latent heat fluxes two wavelength method structure parameters scintillometer 1 introduction sensible and latent heat fluxes form the turbulent heat flux contribution to the land surface energy balance latent heat flux being proportional to evapotranspiration determines local and global of water balance the kilometer scale surface energy budget is crucial to meteorological and hydrological modelling since it determines the exchanges of heat and water between the surface and the atmosphere accurate measurements of energy fluxes are important to improve hydrologic and climatic models and the demand for reliable kilometer scale energy flux information is increasing a state of the art approach for monitoring surface fluxes is the eddy covariance ec technique especially for the regional scales of hundred meters it has been widely used in surface flux observation networks worldwide baldocchi et al 2000 a combination of several ec towers together can provide a kilometer scale surface turbulent heat fluxes which was comparable to pixel size data sets such as numerical simulation results or reanalysis compared with ec method a ground based remote sensing technique scintillometry can offer another option to monitor the kilometer scale turbulent fluxes moreover scintillometry is more suitable for long term validation of remotely sensed products and verification of model simulation results due to its large area of observation kohsiek and herben 1983 green et al 2001 de bruin 2002 mei sun yee et al 2015 the near infrared and microwave wavelengths were combined when using scintillometry to derive surface heat fluxes the air temperature t fluctuations dominate the received signal at near infrared wavelengths and the microwave wavelengths are more sensitive to humidity q fluctuations therefore the temperature structure parameter c t 2 and the humidity structure parameter c q 2 can be derived from the refractive index structure parameter c n 2 a parameter for different wavelengths λi then fluxes of sensible and latent water vapor heat can be derived by using the two wavelength or bichromatic correlation method base on the monin obukhov similarity theory andreas 1989 compared with ec method scintillometry is more depended on the applicability of similarity theory therefore it is useful for homogeneous underlying surface previous studies have compared scintillometry with ec meijninger et al 2006 shown that sensible heat flux h from scintillometry about 7 higher than from ec and latent heat flux le about 26 higher than ec results the energy balance of scintillometry was 0 86 ward et al 2015 has pointed out that le from scintillometry is about 14 higher than from ec le form scintillometry higher than from ec and the energy balance closure of scintillometry larger than ec is also be founded by meijninger et al 2002 the two wavelength technique has been used over various landscapes such as vineyard green et al 2000 mixed farmland meijninger et al 2002 plains mei et al 2015 urban landscapes ward et al 2015 forests isabelle et al 2020 within these studies the correlation coefficient between the temperature and humidity fluctuations r tq is always set as fixed values typically r tq 0 8 1 however this assumption is not always the case because the turbulent diffusivity for heat and humidity can be different hill 1989 and meijninger et al 2002 founded that r tq varies from 0 77 to 0 95 in their research based on this consideration the bichromatic correlation method outlined by lüdi et al 2005 uses the correlation between the optical and microwave signals to determine the surface fluxes without a constant value of r tq it has shown that the bichromatic correlation method and ec ﬂuxes yields good correlation r 2 up to 0 82 in hilly forests isabelle et al 2020 nevertheless it should be keeping in mind that any scintillometer based surface turbulent measurements are based on semi empirical relationship its results still need to be verified across ecosystems that differ in landscape and hydrological conditions water resources are scarce in the hilly area of northern china and precipitation is mainly concentrated in the growing season in these area land surface turbulent flux varies significantly corresponding to change in hydrological conditions with the help of an observation experiment based on an optical microwave scintillometer oms and an ec system this study tries to get a kilometer scale surface turbulent heat fluxes over a hilly area in henan province china to achieve this goal the applicability of scintillometry mainly based on a comparison with ec observation need to be ascertain first this study was expected to provide insights and reduce uncertainty for utilizing scintillometry measurements over terrain regions 2 material

however before being stored in memory card the raw data were smoothed using a running mean filter with a default of 10 s and the variance was calculated with a 1 min resolution even though there are still some spikes left in the variance data to remove these spikes the value x i with in the variance data which deviates more than 3 5 times the standard deviation σ j from the mean value on every 5 min was characterized as a spike and removed højstrup 1993 thus the structure parameters were initially calculated at 1 min intervals and then they were averaged into 30 min blocks the data from april 27 to october 24 2018 are used in this study the 1 min records were then proceeded as following steps the optical data were rejected based on theoretical arguments which have revealed that saturation occurred when c n b l s 2 exceeds 0 193d 5 3 λ 1 3 l 8 3 kleissl et al 2010a 2010b less than 0 01 of our data suffered from saturation the mws system was not affected by saturation data were also removed when there were drops in signal intensity due to power failure rainfall higher relative humidity 90 or maintenance the 30 min averaged fluxes lower than 100 w m 2 or larger than 700 w m 2 were also removed 2 4 2 eddy covariance the data from the ec system were processed using eddypro version 6 2 0 to calculate the average fluxes at 30 min intervals the processing involved spike detection lag removal correction relative to the vertical wind component based on covariance maximization sonic virtual temperature correction double coordinate rotation and a wpl density correction webb et al 1980 we also considered the impact of flux storage and the storage fluxes of the sensible and latent heat were estimated from concentrations and were based on a 1 point profile produced by eddypro to ensure the quality of the ec data the final data record was deleted if it met the following criteria 1 evidence of rainfall and maintenance issues 2 a friction velocity of u 0 15 m s 1 or 3 implausible values 100 or 700 w m 2 2 4 3 soil heat flux the method of calculating the soil heat storage by observing the average soil temperature above buried deep z r m through the tcav average soil thermocouple tcav manual 2006 combining with the measured soil heat flux at z r m obtains the surface soil heat flux g 0 w m 2 referred to as the tcav method the depth z r of the buried heat flux

δts is the change of leaf temperature per half hour and the surface temperature ts was derived by the longwave radiation fluxes based on the stefan boltzmann law as follows 20 t s r l ε σ 1 4 where σ

et al 2008 2 4 5 footprint analyses the source area footprint of ec was estimated by the analytical model kormann and meixner 2001 21 f x y z m d y x y f y x z m where x y z m are the downwind distance pointing against the average horizontal wind direction the crosswind wind distance and the measurement height respectively d y x y is the gaussian crosswind distribution function of the lateral dispersion and f y x z m is the crosswind integrated footprint the source area of scintillometry was computed following liu et al 2011 by combing the kormann and meixner 2001 model with the scintillometer path weighting as detailed in the oms manual rpg manual 2014 22 f o m s x y z m x 1 x 2 w x f x x y y z m d x where x1 x2 are the locations of oms transmitter and receiver respectively

resolution as the total calculation area 3 results 3 1 weather conditions the synoptic background during the observation period are plotted in fig 3 the air temperature ta varied from 8 c to 36 c and the highest temperature occurred during june however ta was usually less than 30 c during the study period net radiation began to increase from may and reached its annual maximum in july most days net radiation exceeded 700 w m 2 precipitation occurred frequently from june to august and concentrated in june and july the relative humidity rh and soil water content swc increased with precipitation rh ranges from 12 to 100 and rh is mostly greater than 40 during the precipitation period the changes in the soil water content at 5 cm were very abrupt while those at 20 cm occurred smoothly it is also to see that precipitation in june and july increased significantly with total of 413 2 mm accounting for 77 of total precipitation during the entire growing season the rainfall in september is 98 mm basing on the precipitation pattern we defined june july and september as wet period while other months as dry period 3 2 comparison between oms and ec the turbulent heat fluxes from oms were compared to ec fluxes fig 4 two kinds of h from oms h bc and h tw were a bit greater than ec h ec for about 1 2 compared with h le obtained from oms were 10 greater than that from ec le ec using ec as a bench mark then the bc method eq 7 intend to overestimate the surface heat flux than the tw method eq 5 in generally the results from scintillometer show quite good accordance with that from ec in dry and wet seasons the diurnal variations of turbulent heat fluxes given by oms was shown fig 5 it is obvious that fluxes from oms and ec showed similar diurnal patterns just like rn fluxes became higher due to the increased radiative input and the maximum of each flux was appeared around 13 00 it is also can be find that h form oms was generally closer to h ec in both dry and wet periods moreover it worth noting that h from oms was slightly smaller than h ec in the morning during wet period while h larger than h ec in afternoon during both periods and the biggest differences are 49 92 w m 2 and 63 06 w m 2 h bc h ec respectively compared to h differences of le between oms and ec were larger than these of h the biggest differences were 52 15 w m 2 and 71 37 w m 2 le bc le ec during the two periods le from oms was higher than rn after 16 30 indicating a potential overestimation of le a plausible explanation for the smaller h in the morning during the period could be the enhanced evapotranspiration generally the differences in the h from oms and ec are well correlated with the magnitude of h ec in both the dry and wet periods while le obtained from oms exhibits larger than le ec fluxes from oms and ec during both dry and wet periods were compared in fig 6 relationships of h between oms and ec in dry and wet period were shown as slightly higher slopes and good correlations r2 0 7 with intercepts of 15 w m 2 h showed much scatter when values of oms larger than 400 w m 2 this would cause the intercepts of h indicating that there is larger difference between oms and ec when there is larger h le from oms were higher than from ec the slope is 1 10 with quite different correlations and intercepts during the two periods the intercepts of le during dry period were higher than these during wet period and correlations showed better in wet period than in dry period this can be explained by that the le from oms were larger than from ec overall and there are still scatters in higher fluxes when evapotranspiration is not dominated it reveals that the capability of oms to measure both sensible and latent heat fluxes are stable and changes in hydrological process have no effects on this during study period the leaf area index lai in our area was typically ranged from 1 to 3 m2 m 2 ornl daac 2018 myneni park 2015 while the lai ranged from 0 6 to 1 m2 m 2 in october which is the growth ending the leaves are gradually falling changes in lai also have no effects on the fluxes measured by oms even during the october relationship between h bc and h ec showed slope of 1 03 and intercept of 12 56 w m 2 r2 0 70 and relationship between le bc and le ec showed slope of 1 12 and intercept of 7 32 w m 2 r2 0 73 3 3 footprints of oms and ec the wind speeds and directions during the observation period left and the source areas of the fluxes from each system right are shown in fig 7 the predominant winds at the site were from the northeast and the wind speed usually ranged from 1 to 4 m s 1 but on rare occasions it reached 7 m s 1 the wind speed from the northeast was often larger than that from other directions the 90 contribution areas reached about 310 m and 700 m to the north and about 220 m and 380 m to the south for the ec and oms measurements fig 7 respectively we also compared the fluxes from the two different methods when 90 contribution area of ec is completely covered by source area of oms referring fig 7 and results showed in fig 8 the slope of regressed line between h from oms and ec is 1 05 while the slopes of le were little difference 1 07 for the tw method and 1 09 for the bc method monthly averaged footprint overlap percent reached up to 55 at october and there is smallest percentage of 28 at july fig 9 however there is no clear trend in the difference of heat fluxes between oms and ec as footprint overlap increased difference of h between oms and ec showed a positive correlation with a slope of 0 07 with intercept of 1 93 w m 2 and r2 of 0 96 with condition of rn 50 w m 2 and the difference of le showed a slope of 0 10 with intercept of 3 57 w m 2 and r2 of 0 96 fig 10 it reveals that fluxes derived from oms do not change with footprints and the difference between oms and ec become lager when there are higher fluxes 3 4 energy balance closure energy balance closure was estimated by plotting the sum of turbulent heat fluxes against the available energy calculated by net radiation minus soil surface heat flux and the storage term of the forest canopy rn g 0 s with the 30 min averaged fluxes g 0 and s calculated by eqs 18 and 19 the energy balance derived from the ec has a closure of 0 81 fig 11 with intercepts of 11 85 w m 2 the energy imbalance of ec is widely detected in the field measurements including our research wilson et al 2002 suggests that the mismatch of footprint for each energy component is one of the main reasons for the energy imbalance rn and gs measured at the tower site are at much smaller scales and they cannot represent the same scale of ec or even the scintillometry in our research this would be one reason for the imbalance in our site secondly energy balance could improve 5 or 10 in forests when considering the canopy heat storage michiles and gielow 2008 liu et al 2011 the heat storage of forest canopy was estimated by an empirical method this would also be contributed to poor energy additionally the uncaptured larger eddies and secondary circulations in the complex terrain would be one of the reasons for the imbalance of energy mauder et al 2007 foken 2008 however the energy balance of scintillometry was 1 03 with intercepts of 19 46 w m 2 and 18 29 w m 2 for bc and tw respectively indicating that scintillometry in our measurements gives overestimated fluxes 4 discussion the results of the turbulent fluxes were obtained by applying scintillometry to a complex landscape at the several kilometer scale our results show that the trends of both the sensible and latent heat fluxes obtained using oms are broadly consistent with the ec results h from the scintillometry is similar to h ec while le from scintillometry is 11 higher than le ec this is broadly consistent with the results of previous studies involving two wavelength scintillometry previous studies have shown that the sensible heat fluxes are about 7 higher than the ec fluxes and the latent heat fluxes are 10 26 higher than the ec results when different r tq values are assumed meijninger et al 2006 ward et al 2015 yee et al 2015 isabelle et al 2020 lüdi et al 2005 pointed out that r tq is large and positive i e high correlation between temperature and humidity during the day and negative i e anti correlation between temperature and humidity during the night moreover r tq is thought to be a useful indicator of the violation of most hill 1989 andreas et al 1998 and the irregular changes in r tq during the night imply that the use of similarity functions may be inappropriate at these times we assumed that r tq 1 for unstable conditions and r tq 1 for stable conditions in this research studies also showed that r tq 1 is rare and often ranged 0 5 0 9 meijninger et al 2006 ward et al 2015 in our study r tq fluctuates between 0 8 and 0 at night and commonly varies smoothly from 0 6 to 0 9 during the day which indicates that the violation of most is small lüdi et al 2005 and oms is suitable for our observation need moreover it can be found that fluxes estimated by the bc method were slightly higher than from the tw method the reason can be explained by the values of assumed r tq which mentioned in the previous paragraph with the assumed values the structure parameters of temperature and humidity in the example days of dry 2018 05 05 and wet 2018 07 12 from oms and ec are generally following similar trends to each other fig 12 previous study also reported that c t 2 and c q 2 show good identities between ec and oms kohsiek and herben 1983 meijninger et al 2006 ward et al 2015 however in our study c t 2 and c q 2 from bc are often higher than from tw method in two example days this would lead to the fluxes from oms using bc were higher than using tw method we tried r tq 0 6 0 8 and found that c t 2 and c q 2 from tw method are much closer to the bc when the r tq with a smaller values especially for c q 2 indicating that the r tq values would be lead to deviations of fluxes another possible explanation is the effect of tower vibrations the transmitters were mounted at top of a tall tower sometimes subject to vibrations contaminating the measurements of oms vibrations would cause biased on the third term c n o m s 2 eq 7 and c n m w s 2 due to the millimeter wave length while assumed r tq values can avoid the biased on c n o m s 2 it will filter the calculation of c t 2 and c q 2 and have influence on the fluxes results von randow et al 2008 also found that tower vibrations need to be corrected in oms measurement however it is difficult to do this in our research due to unsaved scintillation voltage time series and unmeasured tower vibration since the ec observations were used as benchmark in our research and the effect of the storage flux was also considered the turbulent fluxes measured using oms were overestimated although the scintillometer path weighting function indicates that the maximum sensitivity is toward the center of the path hoedjes et al 2007 liu et al 2013 and we intentionally located the ec station near the middle of the path oms still has a much larger source area than the ec evans 2009 also showed that the correlation of the scintillometer fluxes with the aggregation of several ec fluxes was much better than the correlation with the individual ec fluxes the different source areas of the instruments should also be noted we also analyzed heat fluxes with condition of the source area of ec was overlaps with of oms sensible heat fluxes are well quantified by the scintillometry while the latent heat fluxes are overestimated fig 8 although the study area is basically covered by trees fig 1 the difference of surface temperature due to the heterogeneity would also contribute to the difference in heat fluxes liu et al 2011 malone et al 2014 suggest that poor energy closure may be partly due to the underestimation of le and h and zhao et al 2018 replaced h observed by the ec with h obtained from the near infrared scintillometer the energy balance was improved by 6 scintillometry emit certain wavelengths travel between transmitters and receivers separated by a few kilometers and fluctuations in the intensity of received signals can be linked to turbulence kleissl et al 2010a 2010b it has advantage to obtained the information of turbulence in both larger and smaller eddies with much higher sampling frequency on the contrary larger eddies cannot be captured by ec on the typical averaging period of 30 min whereas 60 min was found more appropriate for forest ecosystem berger et al 2001 although oms show certain advantages in observations energy balance of scintillometry is higher than ec in our research we attribute this to the overestimation of le from oms however the difference between scintillometry and ec measurements still widely exist further explored on the discrepancies in different ecosystems may potentially improve the measurements of turbulent heat fluxes from the above we conclude that measurements from scintillometry and ec still showed an imbalance and this would cause the difference between the two method and the difference between two calculation of structure parameter by scintillometry tw and bc indicates that it should be careful when used a fixed r tq value generally our research shows that the results of the scintillometry and the ec measurements are in good agreement which indicates that the scintillometry is a reliable system for measuring energy fluxes over non uniform terrain 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of a commercially available optical microwave scintillometer oms system to measure the turbulent fluxes over a non uniform land surface using the two wavelength and bichromatic correlation methods results show that 1 both sensible heat fluxes from oms showed slightly higher than ec whilst the latent heat fluxes from oms showed around 10 higher than ec 2 the capability of oms to measure both sensible and latent heat fluxes are stable changes in hydrological process or footprints have no effects on this 3 oms in our study showed over closure of energy balance due to the overestimation of turbulent we concluded that oms can be a reliable approach to measure kilometer scale surface turbulent heat fluxes although discrepancies still widely exist between oms and ec measurements the reasons for the discrepancies still need to be further explored which would improve our understanding of the two techniques and may improve the energy balance closure in measurements the study also shows that the difference between two wavelength method and bichromatic correlation method still exist due to the limitation of scintillometry more testing on scintillometry especially the derivation of latent heat fluxes across a wider range of conditions are definitely needed and it is important to make sure vibrations of the mountings are minimized

in semi arid northwestern china groundwater is of vital importance to ecology and food security jin et al 2019 with rapid economic development and growing food demand human exploitation of groundwater has grown geometrically in recent decades and irrigation pumping wells in northern china have grown exponentially with the expansion of agricultural area as a result continuous decline in groundwater levels is observed which in turn leads to problems such as ecological degradation ground subsidence and the loss of pumping wells famiglietti 2014 especially the large scale development of agriculture has replaced the traditional animal husbandry which has accelerated grassland degradation threshold water tables play an important role in sustaining both grassland ecology and irrigated agriculture this paper proposes a new method to quantify the threshold water tables based on the transport rate of wetting front and further shows the advantages of using the threshold water tables as the management target to regulate the pumping wells in an irrigation district in northwestern china the critical depth of groundwater a key variable for managing groundwater pumping is affected by the layout of pumping wells which has been studied over long time theis 1935 introduced the concept of influence radius and introduced the influence radius of observation wells into the pumping well flow equation chen and wu 1981 further explored the physical meaning of the radius of influence and proposed to use the radius of influence an important parameter to design pumping capacity and well layout over an aquifer and to characterize the recharging need xue and xie 2007 applied a groundwater numerical simulation model to analyzing the changes of groundwater flow field from the perspective of water conservancy economy gisser and sánchez 1980 considered the impact of free market and controlled extremes on the optimal layout of wells when the aquifer reserves were large enough researchers also proposed to use integrated groundwater management models to decide pumping well layouts by coupling a groundwater dynamics model and a groundwater policy management model e g gorelick 1983 zipper et al 2018 in particular modflow model has been used as a simulation tool to simulate the dynamic processes of groundwater flow under different well layouts including groundwater exploitation intensity and capacity e g wang et al 2007 zanini et al 2020 for the purpose of economic or maximum water intake and other purposes the optimization of the layout of well groups usually neglects the impact of the ecological environment especially in the mixed areas of agriculture and animal husbandry many researchers have evaluated groundwater critical levels under different hydrogeological conditions and ecosystem maintenance targets using statistical analysis observation experiment or combined methods for instances studied the relationship between different groundwater levels and vegetation growth status and obtained the critical depth of groundwater that would support vegetation growth cochard et al 1992 horton et al 2001 examined the physiological responses of two native riparian species at different groundwater levels and suggested the lowest level to support each of the species taylor et al 2006 used a groundwater model to simulate the ecosystems of the south african estuary that depends on groundwater following these studies the current study is to calculate the wetting front transport rate when the wetting front transport rate reaches 0 the maximum depth that rainfall can recharge groundwater is defined as the critical groundwater depth cgd by taking the cgd as the target the optimal layout of well groups in an irrigation district will be addressed in particular the cgd will be used as a guide to determine the representative distance between wells in the irrigation district to sustain the water table required to sustain the ecosystem furthermore this paper will discuss the advantages of using the threshold water tables as the management target to regulate groundwater pumping and ensure an appropriate water table for the ecological system in the irrigation district 2 data methods 2 1 study area an irrigation district in the west liaohe river watershed located in northeastern china will be used as the study area the main part of the west liaohe river plain is located in tongliao city covering the khorchin grassland by the remote sensing analysis and field investigation it was found that the pattern of the ecosystem in the west liaohe river plain has been changed and the area of cultivated land has exceeded the grassland martin et al 2016 yan et al 2018 in recent years due to the development of the economy in the region and also the shrinking of surface runoff the importance of groundwater in ensuring local food security and ecological security has become increasingly prominent the hydrogeological data in fig 1 shows a 1 50 000 hydrogeological map and 430 hydrogeological boreholes the data related to irrigation management in the study area and the radius of irrigation wells are obtained from the tongliao water conservancy bureau the daily rainfall data are collected from eight national meteorological stations during the period of 1953 2010 the average annual rainfall of the basin is 366 5 mm 2 2 cdg quantification method 2 2 1 calculation of threshold water tables by rainfall recharge according to the water infiltration principle and the critical definition of recharge groundwater rui 2004 when the infiltration process is completed the position where the wetting front disappears is the critical depth of the infiltration recharge groundwater as shown in fig 2 the maximum depth of infiltration that can be achieved by infiltration is the critical depth when the burying depth of phreatic water level is higher than the maximum infiltration depth the infiltration does not reach the aquifer and terminates and the recharge of groundwater cannot be achieved the two most important physical quantities for determining the critical depth are the water supply rainfall intensity return flow and the initial soil water content the depth of infiltration is calculated using the saturated infiltration calculation equation 1 h p f θ s θ i 1000 where h p represents the position of the wetting front in the process of saturated infiltration m f is the amount of rainfall infiltration mm θ s is the saturated water content of the soil cm3 cm3 expressed as a percentage θ i is the initial water content of the soil cm3 cm3 expressed as a percentage by the theory of unsaturated infiltration combined the basic equation is as follows xue and xie 2007 2 ν k θ i 1 k θ i 2 ψ m i ψ m i 1 ψ m i ψ m i 1 δ z k θ i 1 k θ i 2 h m i h m i 1 δ z δ z θ t θ t 1 h t 1 h t 1 δ z where θ t is soil moisture content at the top of the wetting front at time t θ t 1 is soil moisture content at the top of the wetting front at t 1 h h 1 is thickness of the wet layer at t 1 δ z is thickness of soil layering among them h is calculated by using the van genuchten equation as follows rui 2004 3 h 1 α θ s θ r θ θ r 1 m 1 1 n where h is for soil suction cm h2o θ r is wilting soil water content α m n are parameters in which m 1 1 n 2 2 2 concept well construction and interference radius calculation according to dupuit s hypothesis a single pumping well produces a funnel shaped groundwater level drop surface centered on the well axis at a certain flow rate as shown in fig 3 a the equation of groundwater head for the homogeneous steady flow is as follows xue and xie 2007 4 2 h x 2 2 h y 2 2 h z 2 0 where h is the groundwater head x y and z indicate different directions this takes the form of laplace s equation and the solution of the groundwater head follows the superposition principle starnoni and pokrajac 2018 given the well size and pumping capacity the distance l between two wells can have the following three conditions 1 l 2r fig 3b where the wells do not interfere with each other 2 l 2r fig 3c where the distance between two wells is in a critical state and 3 l 2r fig 3d where according to the superposition principle the groundwater level formed by the interference superimposed area of the wells is the sum of the water level drops of the wells the definition of the concept well model is based on the boundary conditions of hydrogeology and irrigation system in west liaohe river plain for wells that fully penetrate the phreatic aquifer by setting different conditions for the well an ideal well model that reflects the hydrogeological characteristics of the hydrological condition is established the local hydrogeology is divided by the principle of similarity wang et al 2016 the hydrogeological divisions are as follows ① the soil type is the same or similar ② the aquifer thickness is not much different or similar and ③ the surface soil has little effect on the groundwater which is mainly for the middle soil layer and the influence of the topsoil is neglected in the classification the theoretical equation for calculating the reference radius to select a well that fully penetrate i e a holonomic well the phreatic aquifer is as follows xue and xie 2007 5 r r w e π ks 2h 0 s q q is water withdrawal k is permeability coefficient s is water level drawdown of the well during pumping r is interference radius r w is pumping well radius h 0 is thickness of the aquifer an empirical equation for non holonomic wells follows xue and xie 2007 6 r 2 s h 0 k the k is determined by the empirical equation which is as follows the parameters q and h are derived from the drilling data of hydrogeological survey data xue and xie 2007 7 k 100 q h in which q is the water inflow in a single well h is the depth of dynamic drop in single well pumping the maximum allowable drawdown s adopts the rainfall threshold water tables by rainfall recharge in the irrigation district of the study area minus the current burying depth of the groundwater by investigation the calculation equation is as follows 8 maxs h critical h b u r y i n g d e p t h where h critical is the critical burying depth h burying depth is the groundwater burying depth per year 3 results 3 1 threshold water tables the infiltration depths and infiltration amount with a given soil water content are calculated using eqs 1 3 when the annual rainfall is 216 mm and the initial soil moisture content is 15 4 the rates and distances of the wetting front movement are calculated and displayed in table 1 based on the calculation of the infiltration depths in different years and different soil water contents the depth of rainfall infiltration into groundwater under nine precipitation and soil moisture conditions are shown in table 2 in summary under regular conditions the rainfall infiltration depth is 5 5 8 5 m the irrigation return flow recharge can increase the infiltration depth by 1 5 m zhang 2012 and the infiltration depth is updated to the range of 7 10 m with the impact of return flow 3 2 hydrogeological zoning by analyzing the hydrogeological map of the study area five hydrogeological divisions are classified under different ranges of aquifer thicknesses using the principle of similarity as shown in table 3 also see fig 1 3 3 permeability coefficient k the raw data used in estimating the permeability coefficient include the water inflow of the borehole the depth of the borehole and the depth of the borehole water level zhang et al 2017 which are obtained from the five hydrogeological divisions table 3 through hydrogeological drilling experiments in each of the divisions 1 2 3 4 5 the numbers of drilling holes are 130 238 25 8 and 24 eyes respectively in divisions 1 2 3 and 5 eq 7 is used to calculate k and results are shown in fig 4 as k is inversely proportional to the interference radius the maximum value of the coefficient should be used to obtain the safest well spacing as the number of drill holes located in division 4 is less than 10 eyes the permeability coefficient in this division is assessed as 6 5 m d by an empirical method provided by zhang 2012 together with the relevant data from the study area 3 4 maximum allowable drawdown s according to the groundwater bury depth and groundwater management practices the single well water inflow in each of the hydrogeological divisions and the depth of the irrigation the maximum allowable drawdown s is calculated by eq 8 as shown in table 4 3 5 the impact of interference radius the radius r w of a pumping well in the study area is 0 1624 m the water output q is taken as the average value of all irrigation wells in a hydrogeological division the thickness of the aquifer is averaged the above parameters are substituted into eq 5 to calculate the well space s and the interference radius r in different divisions for wells that fully penetrate the aquifer the results are shown in table 5 for wells that do not fully penetrate the aquifer i e non holonomic wells an example is provided for hydrogeological division 2 the average water inflow and the average drawdown and the interference radius crossing the 238 hydrogeological drilling holes in the division are obtained by eq 6 as shown in table 6 4 discussions the calculation of the threshold water table i e the critical water table for groundwater pumping control uses a single annual average rainfall as input further analysis is needed in the future to use a rainfall input designed for controlling the risk of over pumping the permeability coefficient is calculated by using the empirical equation 7 derived from hydrogeological survey drilling data and the maximum value within a range is chosen this is different from previous methods which obtained the coefficient by pumping experiments our method is conservative from the point view of groundwater management the maximum allowable drawdown is calculated as the difference between the threshold water table and the current average annual average bury depth this is to minimize the occurrence of reaching the critical water table for sustainable utilization of groundwater in an area with vulnerable ecosystems another limitation of the work is to use an empirical equation eq 6 to calculate the radius of wells that do not fully penetrate the phreatic aquifer although the equation has been widely used in groundwater modeling in china the validation of the equation for the case study area needs need further data support the question of using water table or the total amount of pumping as control for sustainable groundwater management has no firm answer in different areas depending on the hydrogeological conditions and management purposes we propose to use water table i e the threshold water table determined in this study to control groundwater pumping in northwestern china an appropriate level of water table maintains natural hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water in the region the local ecosystems including crop growth soil moisture and soil salinity and biodiversity are sensitive to the water table in the region the study area west liaohe river plain is a typical area in northwestern china with mixed agricultural and pastoral lands the reduction of water table in the irrigation district can lead to the degradation of surrounding grass lands using the threshold water table as a control the amount of total allowable groundwater pumping during a period e g the crop growth season is estimated as the amount at any time place when where the water table is controlled above the threshold level for example for sub region 1 see hydrogeological divisions of table 3 which has irrigated area of 114 73 thousand hectare and annual groundwater pumping use of 646 million m3 the total annual groundwater pumping under the water table control is estimated as 229 574 million m3 which is by average about 80 of the total annual groundwater pumping this shows that current groundwater use in the sub region is unsustainable and about 20 of the current pumping amount should be cut off which can probably be realized by adopting irrigation water saving technologies in additional an appropriate distance between wells may help prevent the rapid drawdown of local water tables in the case study region an empirical assessment of the distance is about two times of the interference radius about 530 m 678 m in some parts of the region the distance depends on the depth of wells when the well depth is less than 100 m the distance should be greater than 300 m when the well depth is between 100 m and 200 m the distance should not be less than 450 m when the well depth is greater than 200 m the distance should not be less than 600 m table 6 the well distribution also depends on crop patterns irrigation water requirement and economic value of crops maneta et al 2009 5 conclusions this paper proposes a new method to calculate the threshold water tables based on the quantification of the transport rate of the wetting front and use the threshold water tables to guide pumping well layout design accounting for ecological requirements and to control sustainable groundwater pumping in an irrigation district the threshold water table is defined as the rainfall infiltration depth when the wetting front transport rate is zero by taking the threshold water table as guideline the relationship between the groundwater level drawdown and the layout of pumping wells in an irrigation district area is analyzed this approach transforms water table control into the design of appropriate space between wells moreover in previous studies the layout of wells in an irrigation district is designed based on a combined consideration of crop patterns water demand and economic value in this study the ecological requirement is included for the well layout design for the study area an irrigation district in northwestern china concepts of interference radius and hydrogeological division are proposed and a conceptual well model is established to analyze the hydrogeological conditions five hydrogeological divisions in the case study area are carried out considering the heterogeneity of hydrogeological conditions the threshold water table in the case study irrigation district is estimated as 10 m the interference radii of the pumping wells are 340 m 270 m and 150 m in three different sub districts when the well depth is greater than 100 m 60 80 m and less than 60 m and the interference radius

hydraulic connection between groundwater and surface water in the region the local ecosystems including crop growth soil moisture and soil salinity and biodiversity are sensitive to the water table in the region the study area west liaohe river plain is a typical area in northwestern china with mixed agricultural and pastoral lands the reduction of water table in the irrigation district can lead to the degradation of surrounding grass lands using the threshold water table as a control the amount of total allowable groundwater pumping during a period e g the crop growth season is estimated as the amount at any time place when where the water table is controlled above the threshold level for example for sub region 1 see hydrogeological divisions of table 3 which has irrigated area of 114 73 thousand hectare and annual groundwater pumping use of 646 million m3 the total annual groundwater pumping under the water table control is estimated as 229 574 million m3 which is by average about 80 of the total annual groundwater pumping this shows that current groundwater use in the sub region is unsustainable and about 20 of the current pumping amount should be cut off which can probably be realized by adopting irrigation water saving technologies in additional an appropriate distance between wells may help prevent the rapid drawdown of local water tables in the case study region an empirical assessment of the distance is about two times of the interference radius about 530 m 678 m in some parts of the region the distance depends on the depth of wells when the well depth is less than 100 m the distance should be greater than 300 m when the well depth is between 100 m and 200 m the distance should not be less than 450 m when the well depth is greater than 200 m the distance should not be less than 600 m table 6 the well distribution also depends on crop patterns irrigation water requirement and economic value of crops maneta et al 2009 5 conclusions this paper proposes a new method to calculate the threshold water tables based on the quantification of the transport rate of the wetting front and use the threshold water tables to guide pumping well layout design accounting for ecological requirements and to control sustainable groundwater pumping in an irrigation district the threshold water table is defined as the rainfall infiltration depth when the wetting front transport rate is zero by taking the threshold water table as guideline the relationship between the groundwater level drawdown and the layout of pumping wells in an irrigation district area is analyzed this approach transforms water table control into the design of appropriate space between wells moreover in previous studies the layout of wells in an irrigation district is designed based on a combined consideration of crop patterns water demand and economic value in this study the ecological requirement is included for the well layout design for the study area an irrigation district in northwestern china concepts of interference radius and hydrogeological division are proposed and a conceptual well model is established to analyze the hydrogeological conditions five hydrogeological divisions in the case study area are carried out considering the heterogeneity of hydrogeological conditions the threshold water table in the case study irrigation district is estimated as 10 m the interference radii of the pumping wells are 340 m 270 m and 150 m in three different sub districts when the well depth is greater than 100 m 60 80 m and less than 60 m and the interference radius values are 225 310 m 165 225 m and 150 m respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10347,irrigation water is a potential source of contamination of leafy vegetables that are grown in the field there is an urgent need to support technologies that are designed to ensure food safety including those technologies that can disinfect irrigation water used to cultivate crops previous research has yet to evaluate the microbial and economic efficacies of water disinfection technologies to be applied during primary production to combat foodborne pathogens the literature describes potential water disinfection technologies that could be applied but studies often focus on plant pathogens and mainly focus on laboratory scale research in this study ozone uv and membrane filtration were evaluated at the lab scale and uv with and without pre filtration were examined in a field trial to determine the reduction of e coli in surface water that is used to irrigate leafy vegetables the cost effectiveness and applications at the field scale were also considered we determined that uv treatment 300 600 j m2 reduced e coli up to 3 log in irrigation water in the lab we found that ozone uf and combined disinfection technologies reduced e coli up to 4 log the cost calculation for uv disinfection 0 09 m3 showed to be less than that of ozone 0 36 m3 and uf 0 43 m3 overall uv was found to be the most feasible disinfection technology in terms of microbial and cost efficacies to treat surface water used for the agricultural irrigation of crops the outcomes of this research can provide input into the minimum requirements needed for water disinfection technologies considering the use and reuse of agricultural waters keywords food safety costs uv irrigation primary production field trial 1 introduction fresh water is a valuable resource that is being challenged given the need to provide safe and healthy food for the growing population this growth requires that we efficiently use our freshwater sources amidst a progressively complex and globalized food chain the circular economy concept as applied to food systems is a potential solution to help achieve the challenges associated with climate change as well as population and economic growth jurgilevich et al 2016 rood et al 2017 this concept also parallels european union eu efforts to reduce water shortage risks and additional agreements to propose legislation on the requirements for water reuse e g for agricultural irrigation council of the european union 2019 food safety plays an essential role in this circular economy concept especially when it comes to finding technological solutions for mitigating food loss and waste vilariño et al 2017 equally important is the design and development of technologies for water disinfection that can support food systems for instance climate change can negatively impact the availability of fresh water for irrigation purposes leading to water scarcity and pressure on food security hanjra and qureshi 2010 thus a need for alternative types of water to be used for irrigation especially recycled water like treated wastewater arises these alternative water sources must still ensure that human and animal health as well as the environment are protected hence there is an urgent need for water disinfection technologies that can ensure these requirements despite this need research on the feasibility of recycling freshwater resources that are then applied to food and feed systems is limited jurgilevich et al 2016 a recent foodborne outbreak resulted in 210 cases of people infected 96 hospitalizations and 5 deaths it was found that water from an irrigation canal was contaminated with escherichia coli o157 h7 and that this strain was the likely contamination source of romaine lettuce during the outbreak centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2018 food and drug administration fda 2018 the risks attributed to the quality of the irrigation water namely as a source of pathogenic microorganisms like that of pathogenic e coli in fresh produce like leafy greens has been well reported alegbeleye et al 2018 allende and monaghan 2015 jongman and korsten 2018 olaimat and holley 2012 pachepsky et al 2011 uyttendaele et al 2015 for example leafy greens like lettuce have been reported to be sources of bacterial infections and endive has been reported to be likely contaminated alegbeleye et al 2018 therefore research examining how to prevent contamination of lettuce and endive are of interest to study in europe a survey on the types of freshwater sources used for irrigation has indicated that groundwater is frequently used however other types of water like surface water mains tap water desalinated water or disinfected urban wastewater are also used to irrigate horticultural crops lechevallier et al 2018 research into water disinfection technologies that can be used to disinfect irrigation from riskier water sources like surface water is a starting point overall the need to ensure safe irrigation water to satisfy the need for safe food while also considering the future of a circular economy in food systems is warranted and will be made possible with effective water disinfection technologies a variety of water disinfection technologies are available on the market many of these have been evaluated for pre and post harvest applications banach and van der fels klerx 2020 van haute et al 2015 a recent prioritization of technologies to disinfect bacterial pathogens in irrigation water ranked ultrasound microfiltration ultraviolet irradiation uv ozone and ultrafiltration uf in the top five disinfection technologies respectively van asselt et al unpublished given the resource available for this study the focus was on ozone uf and uv these are conventional technologies when it comes to wastewater and drinking water treatments their indicative effectivity in terms of microbiological log10 reductions to remove enteric bacterial pathogens and indicator organisms have been reported to range from 2 to 6 log for ozone 5 6 log for uf and 2 4 log for uv collivignarelli et al 2018 despite the promising efficacy of these technologies questions regarding large scale feasibility mobility and costs of the technologies were raised when considering their application to disinfect irrigation water van asselt et al unpublished this study evaluated the microbial efficacy of ozone membrane filtration and uv at a lab scale the cost effectiveness of ozone uf and uv at the field scale was also considered given these results uv with and without pre filtration were selected to test in a field trial to determine the reduction of e coli in surface water used to irrigate leafy greens 2 materials and methods 2 1 surface water surface water was collected from the dijkgraaf canal in

coliforms with the nen iso 4832 method and e coli with the iso 16649 2 method at mérieux nutrisciences ede the netherlands 3 results and discussion during the laboratory study tap and surface water were tested the results of those experiments section 3 1 combined with cost estimates section 3 2 were used to select an optimal technology for treating the surface water during the field trial section 3 3 3 1 laboratory study results from the pre analyses of the surface water showed that background e coli levels ranged from 1 to 1 cfu g while presumptive coliforms ranged from 1 to 100 cfu g results from the pre analyses of cod of the surface water showed that it ranged from 10 to 29 mg l in most cases the efficacy of the technologies was comparable for tap and surface water with the reduction of viable e coli being below the limit of detection lod the results per technology are given below 3 1 1 ozone results in surface water treated with ozone doses of 6 3 6 5 mg l showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod resulting in 4 2 log reduction fig 3a in tap water e coli levels of ozone disinfected water with doses of 2 8 8 7 mg l were also below the lod resulting in 4 4 log reduction data not shown the cod and toc of the surface water before ozone disinfection were respectively 40 2 mg l and 15 1 mg l and afterward was respectively 17 3 mg l and 14 3 mg l the decrease in cod was expected as ozone can oxidize organic and inorganic compounds similarly the toc was reduced since ozone functions as an oxidant and can decrease toc our results concur with previous research which reported the disinfection efficacy of ozone to range from 2 to 6 log for e coli and bacterial pathogens collivignarelli et al 2018 ali et al 2018 reviewed the use of ozonated water to extend the shelf life of fresh cut vegetables as well as reduce bacterial loads for instance ozonated water 4 mg l for 2 min significantly reduced mesophilic psychrotrophic and enterobacteriaceae bacteria respectively by 1 7 1 5 and 1 6 log cfu g in fresh cut lettuce akbas and ölmez 2007 in another study papachristodoulou et al 2018 reported that ozonated water 0 8 mg l for 30 s prevented yellowing and maintained the quality of fresh cut spinach also it helped decrease enterobacteriaceae spp and gram negative bacteria about 1 8 and 2 8 log cfu g respectively during the first 5 d of storage compared to experiments with non treated water our study evaluated higher doses of ozone compared to some literature which can explain the higher log reductions 4 log for e coli reported for both ozone disinfected tap and surface water 3 1 2 ultrafiltration results in surface water treated with uf showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod resulting in 4 5 log reduction fig 3c this observation was also found in tap water data not shown our results concur with previous research which reported the disinfection efficacy of uf to range from 5 5 to 6 log for e coli and fecal coliforms collivignarelli et al 2018 the cod and toc of the surface water before disinfection treatments were 26 mg l and 10 mg l respectively after disinfection the cod of the surface water was above the upper limit of quantification 150 mg l while the toc was determined to be 351 mg l these results showed that the cod and toc increased after the installation of a new filter which was not expected and was probably caused by the release of glycerin c a 20 from the newly installed filter this increase may be avoided if the filter is flushed before use the possibility of an increased toc and cod due to the installation of a new filter is relevant to realize for on site field applications moreover with uf it is important to prevent the possibility of membrane fouling as this may then result in increased operating costs to either clean or replace the membrane or can negatively affect the quality of the water to be treated 3 1 3 ultraviolet irradiation results for surface water treated with uv applied in a dose ranging from 363 to 545 j m2 showed that the reduction varied between about 2 and 3 log fig 3c in the tap water a 2 3 log reduction of e coli was also observed given uv doses of 313 500 j m2 data not shown the cod of the surface water before and after uv disinfection was respectively 40 8 mg l and 40 6 mg l stable cod values were expected as uv photolysis can only reduce some organic compounds toc was not analyzed our results concur with previous research which reported the disinfection efficacy of uv to range from 2 to 4 log for e coli and bacterial pathogens collivignarelli et al 2018 even though higher uv doses were applied to treat the surface water there were minimal differences observed in the e coli log reductions compared to that in tap water this result can be expected since the cod and toc levels in surface water were higher than in tap water suspended soils and organic matter in the water are known to reduce uv transmittance van haute et al 2015 the results of our study showed that with the doses tested uv alone up to 545 j m2 was the least effective singly applied technology in reducing e coli in the tap and surface water 3 1 4 combined technologies results for i uf and ozone doses 2 0 10 6 mg in tap water showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod 4 8 log while in surface water with doses 4 1 16 9 mg l the reduction was also to below the lod 4 5 log results with ii uv and ozone in tap water showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod 4 7 log given uv doses of 119 476 j m2 and ozone doses of 2 8 11 4 mg l in surface water e coli reduction ranged between about 3 log and to below the lod 4 5 log depending on the dose applied fig 3d results for iii uf and uv disinfection in tap water with uv doses of 299 478 j m2 showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod 4 6 log while in surface water with uv doses of 367 j m2 and 489 j m2 the reduction of e coli was also to below the lod 4 4 log finally for iv uf uv and ozone disinfection there was a reduction of e coli to below the lod of 4 7 and 4 5 log respectively for tap and surface water the doses in the tap water of uv were 122 365 j m2 and of ozone were 2 8 8 6 mg l the doses in surface water of uv were 235 470 j m2 and of ozone were 5 1 10 5 mg l the cod and or toc were also analyzed for four combinations of water disinfection treatments after treatments the cod ranged from 37 4 to 49 3 mg l while the toc ranged from 14 3 to 19 2 mg l the toc was not analyzed for treatment iii uf and uv overall when the four sets of combined technologies were tested in tap and surface water i uf and ozone ii uv and ozone iii uf and uv and iv uf uv and ozone e coli was reduced to below the lod in all cases 4 log our lab study investigated uv disinfection given a one lamp application however other studies have shown the increased effectivity in microbial reductions given higher doses e g from the use of additional lamps longer treatment times and or in the case of combined technologies when uv was combined with ozone ii this also increased the microbial efficiency research on the use of uv and ozone disinfection technologies singly and in combination in ultrapure and tap water has shown that co exposure to these disinfection technologies enhanced e coli inactivation fang et al 2014 the longer the treatment dose and contact time the higher the e coli reduction this result concurs with our study which found that with ii uv and ozone treatment a 4 log reduction of e coli given the applied doses was found in tap and surface water besides this the type of water to be treated can influence the efficacy of some technologies this influence was observed during the combination of ii uv and ozone in surface water the other water disinfection technology combinations that were tested all included the use of uf uf alone was observed to inactivate e coli in the tested waters thus the additional effect of uf in combination with other technologies could not be differentiated however previous research has reported a 7 5 log reduction of e coli given ozonation membrane ultra filtration using iron oxide coated membranes karnik et al 2007 besides this inactivation using filtration and ozone has been reported to offer advantages such as a low level of membrane fouling given minimal ozone concentrations schlichter et al 2004 from the literature other disinfection combinations namely coagulation before low dose ozone and uf treatments of contaminated surface water were performed to mitigate membrane fouling yu et al 2016 therefore besides microbial activation the use of combined technologies can provide other advantages such as preventing membrane fouling or the possibility to use lower doses of ozone overall research that evaluated the disinfection efficacy of multiple combinations of disinfection technologies on irrigation water is limited and therefore our results help remedy this data gap 3 2 cost calculation model the cost calculation model provided a cost estimate for each of the singly applied technologies ozone uf and uv when used to treat irrigation water at the field scale results showed that for this application uv had the lowest costs per m3 of water treated at 0 09 m3 followed by ozone at 0 36 m3 and uf at 0 43 m3 fig 4 previous research has shown that cost is a relevant managerial criterion when considering water disinfection technologies to be implemented for water disinfection during irrigation dandie et al 2019 van haute et al 2015 since using water disinfection technologies for open field irrigation is currently not yet state of the art and the costs of water disinfection technologies are limited an evaluation can be made to other comparable applications an example of this is the disinfection of irrigation water for horticultural greenhouse applications a recent report evaluated the costs for uv disinfection which ranged from 0 1 to 0 47 m3 for comparable volumes 11 100 110 000 m3 ha year for disinfection using microfiltration or ultrafiltration technologies the average operating costs were estimated to be 0 1 0 15 m3 of produced permeate thompson et al 2018 our study is novel in that it evaluates the costs for three water disinfection technologies for use in agricultural water also showing the differences in capex and opex also the scale and mobility of the technologies are considered for a field application it is essential to realize that there may be further effects on like the economic depreciation in comparison to the technical life span of the equipment which had not been implemented in this model and hence is a limitation of the model moreover it is important to realize that the effects of total costs were partly due to energy costs as calculated in the opex in the agricultural sector the use of renewable energy sources has a large potential chel and kaushik 2011 and is more often being implemented given an increased use of renewable energy the final costs calculated could then change nonetheless the current model allows for a comparison of costs when assessing and selecting the most feasible technologies to be applied at the field scale 3 3 field trial a combination of the microbial efficacy observed with uv treated surface water 3 log reduction of e coli along with the low costs for uv prompted further research in a field trial during the field trial uv was evaluated with and without pre filtration a post calculation based on the executed field trial and given the model assumptions demonstrated that the total expected costs for water treatment by uv for an 80 m3 h situation with 300 j m2 uv dose are about 0 052 m3 water with costs ranging from 0 039 to 0 065 given a 45 65 uv transmittance testing uv in the field trial showed that uv treatment of the irrigation water was capable of inactivating 3 log cfu ml of e coli in the water irrespective of pre filtration fig 5 there was no clear uv dose effect detected in the field trial given the uv doses tested the cod and toc of the irrigation water before inoculum and treatments were also analyzed during weeks 1 3 and 5 during week 1 cod was 26 28 mg l and toc was 9 8 10 mg l while during week 3 cod was about 32 mg l and toc was 10 51 mg l finally during week 5 cod was 31 35 mg l and toc was 11 78 mg l overall cod appeared stable during cultivation while toc had a wider variation during cultivation there is a slight dip in the log reduction observed at 450 j m2 week 3 a reason for the variation in microbial efficacy may be because before the water was collected and transported to the field site for week 3 sandbags lining the canal had been removed resulting in water with higher turbidity and increased suspended solids suspended solids and organic matter affect uv transmittance van haute et al 2015 and the microbial effectivity of the technology is limited by turbid water dandie et al 2019 in the field trial we corrected for the transmission of the water however particulate can influence uv the amount of which can vary depending on the water source and if too high then extra costs would be needed to be able to pre treat before uv disinfection crops were analyzed for sensory aspects before harvest according to the karlsruher evaluation scheme lettuce for the aspect color scored satisfactory 6 regardless of the treatment for lettuce that was treated with irrigation water disinfected by f uv the aspect shape scored excellent 9 while the lettuce from the control and uv treated irrigation water scored very good 8 all lettuce regardless of the treatment scored excellent 9 for the aspect odor and very good 8 for the aspect texture consistency the quality classification of the endive was lower than that for lettuce concerning the aspect appearance color and shape endive irrigated with water treated with uv scored mediocre 5 for the aspect color while control untreated endive and endive with water treated with f uv scored poor 3 concerning the aspect shape the endive irrigated with water treated with by f uv scored borderline 4 while control untreated endive and endive with water treated with uv scored bad 2 nevertheless the scores for the aspects odor and texture for all the endive samples scored excellent 9 in addition to the sensory aspects the weights of the crops were measured after harvest and ranged from 146 to 507 g for lettuce and 185 to 843 g for endive overall the expert reported that disinfection technologies did not negatively affect the sensory quality of the crops lettuce and endive were analyzed n 3 for microbiological loads after harvest the mean standard deviation of the aerobic plate counts apcs total coliform counts tccs and e coli counts ecc for control untreated surface water uv and f uv treatments were examined table 2 apcs for leafy greens in this study ranged from 4 8 to 6 5 log cfu g which is similar to that found in leafy greens reported by johnston et al 2005 of 4 5 6 2 log cfu g apcs are used as a quality indicator our results for tccs ranged from 3 6 to 4 3 log cfu g the tccs in crops irrigated with treated water were comparable to the tccs in the control treatment coliforms are often used as a hygiene indicator our values are slightly higher than other studies reporting coliforms on leafy greens and lettuce of 2 0 4 0 log mpn g mukherjee et al 2004 and on several types of leafy greens of 1 0 3 4 log cfu g johnston et al 2005 results for ecc showed 1 log cfu g for both crops except for endive when irrigation water had been treated with f uv which had 1 65 log cfu g table 2 for e coli there are eu legal limits available for precut vegetables ready to eat taken during the manufacturing process given a sampling plan of n 5 where n is the number of units comprising the sample and c 2 where c is the number of sample units between m and m the limits which refer to each sample unit tested are m 100 cfu g and m 1000 cfu g european commission 2005 results are considered unsatisfactory if one or more of the values observed are m or more than c n values are between m and m european commission 2005 for irrigation water eu guidelines for e coli in irrigation water indicate levels between 1000 and 10 000 cfu 100 ml for vegetables that are likely to be eaten uncooked and where the irrigation water comes into direct contact with the edible portions of the vegetable then the guideline for e coli in irrigation water is 100 cfu 100 ml european commission 2017 the results in the field trial showed that the application of uv or f uv are promising technologies to disinfect irrigation water for agriculture however once the water has been disinfected with physical methods such as uv or f uv it is susceptible to re contamination if not used directly since a residual effect from the disinfection technology is not available the use of filters may also cause additional stress on the technology if proper maintenance is not followed and biofilms form therefore the set up and application of uv disinfection should be designed to avoid potential re contamination overall uv disinfection of the irrigation water is a promising technology to disinfect alternative irrigation water sources like surface water the use of this technology to treat recycled irrigation water and support the circular economy concept in food systems should be carefully evaluated the outcomes of this research are also of relevance to upcoming eu regulations on the minimum requirements for the quality of reused water for agricultural irrigation it is expected that a water disinfection technology would be needed to ensure the minimum requirements for microbiological safety 4 conclusions the laboratory study performed showed that the tested doses of uv disinfection 313 545 j m2 resulted in a 2 3 log reduction of e coli in both tap and surface water while other disinfection technologies showed e coli reductions from 3 to 4 log the study also considered the differences in capex and opex for ozone uf and uv uv resulted in the lowest costs per m3 of water even though ozone and uf reduced e coli in surface water they were calculated to be less cost effective than uv which motivated the evaluation of uv in the field trial furthermore the study showed that the application of uv in the field is feasible and uv water disinfection is an effective technology against bacterial foodborne microorganisms like e coli to treat surface water used for irrigating leafy greens overall the study describes for the first time the efficacy of using several combinations of water disinfection technologies to treat irrigation water as well as the economics of water disinfection technologies ozone uf and uv the results showed that the most suitable technology for the disinfection of surface water used to irrigate leafy greens was uv uv can be used to treat surface water intended to irrigate leafy greens if care is taken to prevent any re contamination of already treated water and if the doses are adjusted to the type of the irrigation water to be treated further research into the technical feasibility of the water disinfection technologies implemented on site at the full scale including for promising cases like uv water disinfection needs to be further piloted and substantiated with

10347,irrigation water is a potential source of contamination of leafy vegetables that are grown in the field there is an urgent need to support technologies that are designed to ensure food safety including those technologies that can disinfect irrigation water used to cultivate crops previous research has yet to evaluate the microbial and economic efficacies of water disinfection technologies to be applied during primary production to combat foodborne pathogens the literature describes potential water disinfection technologies that could be applied but studies often focus on plant pathogens and mainly focus on laboratory scale research in this study ozone uv and membrane filtration were evaluated at the lab scale and uv with and without pre filtration were examined in a field trial to determine the reduction of e coli in surface water that is used to irrigate leafy vegetables the cost effectiveness and applications at the field scale were also considered we determined that uv treatment 300 600 j m2 reduced e coli up to 3 log in irrigation water in the lab we found that ozone uf and combined disinfection technologies reduced e coli up to 4 log the cost calculation for uv disinfection 0 09 m3 showed to be less than that of ozone 0 36 m3 and uf 0 43 m3 overall uv was found to be the most feasible disinfection technology in terms of microbial and cost efficacies to treat surface water used for the agricultural irrigation of crops the outcomes of this research can provide input into the minimum requirements needed for water disinfection technologies considering the use and reuse of agricultural waters keywords food safety costs uv irrigation primary production field trial 1 introduction fresh water is a valuable resource that is being challenged given the need to provide safe and healthy food for the growing population this growth requires that we efficiently use our freshwater sources amidst a progressively complex and globalized food chain the circular economy concept as applied to food systems is a potential solution to help achieve the challenges associated with climate change as well as population and economic growth jurgilevich et al 2016 rood et al 2017 this concept also parallels european union eu efforts to reduce water shortage risks and additional agreements to propose legislation on the requirements for water reuse e g for agricultural irrigation council of the european union 2019 food safety plays an essential role in this circular economy concept especially when it comes to finding technological solutions for mitigating food loss and waste vilariño et al 2017 equally important is the design and development of technologies for water disinfection that can support food systems for instance climate change can negatively impact the availability of fresh water for irrigation purposes leading to water scarcity and pressure on food security hanjra and qureshi 2010 thus a need for alternative types of water to be used for irrigation especially recycled water like treated wastewater arises these alternative water sources must still ensure that human and animal health as well as the environment are protected hence there is an urgent need for water disinfection technologies that can ensure these requirements despite this need research on the feasibility of recycling freshwater resources that are then applied to food and feed systems is limited jurgilevich et al 2016 a recent foodborne outbreak resulted in 210 cases of people infected 96 hospitalizations and 5 deaths it was found that water from an irrigation canal was contaminated with escherichia coli o157 h7 and that this strain was the likely contamination source of romaine lettuce during the outbreak centers for disease control and prevention cdc 2018 food and drug administration fda 2018 the risks attributed to the quality of the irrigation water namely as a source of pathogenic microorganisms like that of pathogenic e coli in fresh produce like leafy greens has been well reported alegbeleye et al 2018 allende and monaghan 2015 jongman and korsten 2018 olaimat and holley 2012 pachepsky et al 2011 uyttendaele et al 2015 for example leafy greens like lettuce have been reported to be sources of bacterial infections and endive has been reported to be likely contaminated alegbeleye et al 2018 therefore research examining how to prevent contamination of lettuce and endive are of interest to study in europe a survey on the types of freshwater sources used for irrigation has indicated that groundwater is frequently used however other types of water like surface water mains tap water desalinated water or disinfected urban wastewater are also used to irrigate horticultural crops lechevallier et al 2018 research into water disinfection technologies that can be used to disinfect irrigation from riskier water sources like surface water is a starting point overall the need to ensure safe irrigation water to satisfy the need for safe food while also considering the future of a circular economy in food systems is warranted and will be made possible with effective water disinfection technologies a variety of water disinfection technologies are available on the market many of these have been evaluated for pre and post harvest applications banach and van der fels klerx 2020 van haute et al 2015 a recent prioritization of technologies to disinfect bacterial pathogens in irrigation water ranked ultrasound microfiltration ultraviolet irradiation uv ozone and ultrafiltration uf in the top five disinfection technologies respectively van asselt et al unpublished given the resource available for this study the focus was on ozone uf and uv these are conventional technologies when it comes to wastewater and drinking water treatments their indicative effectivity in terms of microbiological log10 reductions to remove enteric bacterial pathogens and indicator organisms have been reported to range from 2 to 6 log for ozone 5 6 log for uf and 2 4 log for uv collivignarelli et al 2018 despite the promising efficacy of these technologies questions regarding large scale feasibility mobility and costs of the technologies were raised when considering their application to disinfect irrigation water van asselt et al unpublished this study evaluated the microbial efficacy of ozone membrane filtration and uv at a lab scale the cost effectiveness of ozone uf and uv at the field scale was also considered given these results uv with and without pre filtration were selected to test in a field trial to determine the reduction of e coli in surface water used to irrigate leafy greens 2 materials and methods 2 1 surface water surface water was collected from the dijkgraaf canal in

membrane with a pore size of 0 03 µm a new membrane was attached before each treatment each treatment tested 16 17 l batches of tap or surface water the hydraulic retention time i e a full cycle was 1 min during treatments the ozone dose was set by regulating the ozone concentration in the gas and the oxygen gas flow rate while monitoring the redox value to avoid excess ozone and to monitor safety aspects the corresponding ozone production g o3 min was divided by the total volume of the reactor average 16 l to determine the ozone dose at each time interval a uv dose of 5000 j m2 was applied during the experiments the uv dose was calculated at each time interval by using the liquid flow rate of on average 16 l min and the reactor volume 12 l 2 3 3 microbial analyses in the lab study the inoculated 20 l jerry cans were sampled to obtain the initial e coli concentration in the water subsequently between 1 and 4 water samples were taken after treatments tenfold serial dilutions in pps

were tested the results of those experiments section 3 1 combined with cost estimates section 3 2 were used to select an optimal technology for treating the surface water during the field trial section 3 3 3 1 laboratory study results from the pre analyses of the surface water showed that background e coli levels ranged from 1 to 1 cfu g while presumptive coliforms ranged from 1 to 100 cfu g results from the pre analyses of cod of the surface water showed that it ranged from 10 to 29 mg l in most cases the efficacy of the technologies was comparable for tap and surface water with the reduction of viable e coli being below the limit of detection lod the results per technology are given below 3 1 1 ozone results in surface water treated with ozone doses of 6 3 6 5 mg l showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod resulting in 4 2 log reduction fig 3a in tap water e coli levels of ozone disinfected water with doses of 2 8 8 7 mg l were also below the lod resulting in 4 4 log reduction data not shown the cod and toc of the surface water before ozone disinfection were respectively 40 2 mg l and 15 1 mg l and afterward was respectively 17 3 mg l and 14 3 mg l the decrease in cod was expected as ozone can oxidize organic and inorganic compounds similarly the toc was reduced since ozone functions as an oxidant and can decrease toc our results concur with previous research which reported the disinfection efficacy of ozone to range from 2 to 6 log for e coli and bacterial pathogens collivignarelli et al 2018 ali et al 2018 reviewed the use of ozonated water to extend the shelf life of fresh cut vegetables as well as reduce bacterial loads for instance ozonated water 4 mg l for 2 min significantly reduced mesophilic psychrotrophic and enterobacteriaceae bacteria respectively by 1 7 1 5 and 1 6 log cfu g in fresh cut lettuce akbas and ölmez 2007 in another study papachristodoulou et al 2018 reported that ozonated water 0 8 mg l for 30 s prevented yellowing and maintained the quality of fresh cut spinach also it helped decrease enterobacteriaceae spp and gram negative bacteria about 1 8 and 2 8 log cfu g respectively during the first 5 d of storage compared to experiments with non treated water our study evaluated higher doses of ozone compared to some literature which can explain the higher log reductions 4 log for e coli reported for both ozone disinfected tap and surface water 3 1 2 ultrafiltration results in surface water treated with uf showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod resulting in 4 5 log reduction fig 3c this observation was also found in tap water data not shown our results concur with previous research which reported the disinfection efficacy of uf to range from 5 5 to 6 log for e coli and fecal coliforms collivignarelli et al 2018 the cod and toc of the surface water before disinfection treatments were 26 mg l and 10 mg l respectively after disinfection the cod of the surface water was above the upper limit of quantification 150 mg l while the toc was determined to be 351 mg l these results showed that the cod and toc increased after the installation of a new filter which was not expected and was probably caused by the release of glycerin c a 20 from the newly installed filter this increase may be avoided if the filter is flushed before use the possibility of an increased toc and cod due to the installation of a new filter is relevant to realize for on site field applications moreover with uf it is important to prevent the possibility of membrane fouling as this may then result in increased operating costs to either clean or replace the membrane or can negatively affect the quality of the water to be treated 3 1 3 ultraviolet irradiation results for surface water treated with uv applied in a dose ranging from 363 to 545 j m2 showed that the reduction varied between about 2 and 3 log fig 3c in the tap water a 2 3 log reduction of e coli was also observed given uv doses of 313 500 j m2 data not shown the cod of the surface water before and after uv disinfection was respectively 40 8 mg l and 40 6 mg l stable cod values were expected as uv photolysis can only reduce some organic compounds toc was not analyzed our results concur with previous research which reported the disinfection efficacy of uv to range from 2 to 4 log for e coli and bacterial pathogens collivignarelli et al 2018 even though higher uv doses were applied to treat the surface water there were minimal differences observed in the e coli log reductions compared to that in tap water this result can be expected since the cod and toc levels in surface water were higher than in tap water suspended soils and organic matter in the water are known to reduce uv transmittance van haute et al 2015 the results of our study showed that with the doses tested uv alone up to 545 j m2 was the least effective singly applied technology in reducing e coli in the tap and surface water 3 1 4 combined technologies results for i uf and ozone doses 2 0 10 6 mg in tap water showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod 4 8 log while in surface water with doses 4 1 16 9 mg l the reduction was also to below the lod 4 5 log results with ii uv and ozone in tap water showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod 4 7 log given uv doses of 119 476 j m2 and ozone doses of 2 8 11 4 mg l in surface water e coli reduction ranged between about 3 log and to below the lod 4 5 log depending on the dose applied fig 3d results for iii uf and uv disinfection in tap water with uv doses of 299 478 j m2 showed a reduction of e coli to below the lod 4 6 log while in surface water with uv doses of 367 j m2 and 489 j m2 the reduction of e coli was also to below the lod 4 4 log finally for iv uf uv and ozone disinfection there was a reduction of e coli to below the lod of 4 7 and 4 5 log respectively for tap and surface water the doses in the tap water of uv were 122 365 j m2 and of ozone were 2 8 8 6 mg l the doses in surface water of uv were 235 470 j m2 and of ozone were 5 1 10 5 mg l the cod and or toc were also analyzed for four combinations of water disinfection treatments after treatments the cod ranged from 37 4 to 49 3 mg l while the toc ranged from 14 3 to 19 2 mg l the toc was not analyzed for treatment iii uf and uv overall when the four sets of combined technologies were tested in tap and surface water i uf and ozone ii uv and ozone iii uf and uv and iv uf uv and ozone e coli was reduced to below the lod in all cases 4 log our lab study investigated uv disinfection given a one lamp application however other studies have shown the increased effectivity in microbial reductions given higher doses e g from the use of additional lamps longer treatment times and or in the case of combined technologies when uv was combined with ozone ii this also increased the microbial efficiency research on the use of uv and ozone disinfection technologies singly and in combination in ultrapure and tap water has shown that co exposure to these disinfection technologies enhanced e coli inactivation fang et al 2014 the longer the treatment dose and contact time the higher the e coli reduction this result concurs with our study which found that with ii uv and ozone treatment a 4 log reduction of e coli given the applied doses was found in tap and surface water besides this the type of water to be treated can influence the efficacy of some technologies this influence was observed during the combination of ii uv and ozone in surface water the other water disinfection technology combinations that were tested all included the use of uf uf alone was observed to inactivate e coli in the tested waters thus the additional effect of uf in combination with other technologies could not be differentiated however previous research has reported a 7 5 log reduction of e coli given ozonation membrane ultra filtration using iron oxide coated membranes karnik et al 2007 besides this inactivation using filtration and ozone has been reported to offer advantages such as a low level of membrane fouling given minimal ozone concentrations schlichter et al 2004 from the literature other disinfection combinations namely coagulation before low dose ozone and uf treatments of contaminated surface water were performed to mitigate membrane fouling yu et al 2016 therefore besides microbial activation the use of combined technologies can provide other advantages such as preventing membrane fouling or the possibility to use lower doses of ozone overall research that evaluated the disinfection efficacy of multiple combinations of disinfection technologies on irrigation water is limited and therefore our results help remedy this data gap 3 2 cost calculation model the cost calculation model provided a cost estimate for each of the singly applied technologies ozone uf and uv when used to treat irrigation water at the field scale results showed that for this application uv had the lowest costs per m3 of water treated at 0 09 m3 followed by ozone at 0 36 m3 and uf at 0 43 m3 fig 4 previous research has shown that cost is a relevant managerial criterion when considering water disinfection technologies to be implemented for water disinfection during irrigation dandie et al 2019 van haute et al 2015 since using water disinfection technologies for open field irrigation is currently not yet state of the art and the costs of water disinfection technologies are limited an evaluation can be made to other comparable applications an example of this is the disinfection of irrigation water for horticultural greenhouse applications a recent report evaluated the costs for uv disinfection which ranged from 0 1 to 0 47 m3 for comparable volumes 11 100 110 000 m3 ha year for disinfection using microfiltration or ultrafiltration technologies the average operating costs were estimated to be 0 1 0 15 m3 of produced permeate thompson et al 2018 our study is novel in that it evaluates the costs for three water disinfection technologies for use in agricultural water also showing the differences in capex and opex also the scale and mobility of the technologies are considered for a field application it is essential to realize that there may be further effects on like the economic depreciation in comparison to the technical life span of the equipment which had not been implemented in this model and hence is a limitation of the model moreover it is important to realize that the effects of total costs were partly due to energy costs as calculated in the opex in the agricultural sector the use of renewable energy sources has a large potential chel and kaushik 2011 and is more often being implemented given an increased use of renewable energy the final costs calculated could then change nonetheless the current model allows for a comparison of costs when assessing and selecting the most feasible technologies to be applied at the field scale 3 3 field trial a combination of the microbial efficacy observed with uv treated surface water 3 log reduction of e coli along with the low costs for uv prompted further research in a field trial during the field trial uv was evaluated with and without pre filtration a post calculation based on the executed field trial and given the model assumptions demonstrated that the total expected costs for water treatment by uv for an 80 m3 h situation with 300 j m2 uv dose are about 0 052 m3 water with costs ranging from 0 039 to 0 065 given a 45 65 uv transmittance testing uv in the field trial showed that uv treatment of the irrigation water was capable of inactivating 3 log cfu ml of e coli in the water irrespective of pre filtration fig 5 there was no clear uv dose effect detected in the field trial given the uv doses tested the cod and toc of the irrigation water before inoculum and treatments were also analyzed during weeks 1 3 and 5 during week 1 cod was 26 28 mg l and toc was 9 8 10 mg l while during week 3 cod was about 32 mg l and toc was 10 51 mg l finally during week 5 cod was 31 35 mg l and toc was 11 78 mg l overall cod appeared stable during cultivation while toc had a wider variation during cultivation there is a slight dip in the log reduction observed at 450 j m2 week 3 a reason for the variation in microbial efficacy may be because before the water was collected and transported to the field site for week 3 sandbags lining the canal had been removed resulting in water with higher turbidity and increased suspended solids suspended solids and organic matter affect uv transmittance van haute et al 2015 and the microbial effectivity of the technology is limited by turbid water dandie et al 2019 in the field trial we corrected for the transmission of the water however particulate can influence uv the amount of which can vary depending on the water source and if too high then extra costs would be needed to be able to pre treat before uv disinfection crops were analyzed for sensory aspects before harvest according to the karlsruher evaluation scheme lettuce for the aspect color scored satisfactory 6 regardless of the treatment for lettuce that was treated with irrigation water disinfected by f uv the aspect shape scored excellent 9 while the lettuce from the control and uv treated irrigation water scored very good 8 all lettuce regardless of the treatment scored excellent 9 for the aspect odor and very good 8 for the aspect texture consistency the quality classification of the endive was lower than that for lettuce concerning the aspect appearance color and shape endive irrigated with water treated with uv scored mediocre 5 for the aspect color while control untreated endive and endive with water treated with f uv scored poor 3 concerning the aspect shape the endive irrigated with water treated with by f uv scored borderline 4 while control untreated endive and endive with water treated with uv scored bad 2 nevertheless the scores for the aspects odor and texture for all the endive samples scored excellent 9 in addition to the sensory aspects the weights of the crops were measured after harvest and ranged from 146 to 507 g for lettuce and 185 to 843 g for endive overall the expert reported that disinfection technologies did not negatively affect the sensory quality of the crops lettuce and endive were analyzed n 3 for microbiological loads after harvest the mean standard deviation of the aerobic plate counts apcs total coliform counts tccs and e coli counts ecc for control untreated surface water uv and f uv treatments were examined table 2 apcs for leafy greens in this study ranged from 4 8 to 6 5 log cfu g which is similar to that found in leafy greens reported by johnston et al 2005 of 4 5 6 2 log cfu g apcs are used as a quality indicator our results for tccs ranged from 3 6 to 4 3 log cfu g the tccs in crops irrigated with treated water were comparable to the tccs in the control treatment coliforms are often used as a hygiene indicator our values are slightly higher than other studies reporting coliforms on leafy greens and lettuce of 2 0 4 0 log mpn g mukherjee et al 2004 and on several types of leafy greens of 1 0 3 4 log cfu g johnston et al 2005 results for ecc showed 1 log cfu g for both crops except for endive when irrigation water had been treated with f uv which had 1 65 log cfu g table 2 for e coli there are eu legal limits available for precut vegetables ready to eat taken during the manufacturing process given a sampling plan of n 5 where n is the number of units comprising the sample and c 2 where c is the number of sample units between m and m the limits which refer to each sample unit tested are m 100 cfu g and m 1000 cfu g european commission 2005 results are considered unsatisfactory if one or more of the values observed are m or more than c n values are between m and m european commission 2005 for irrigation water eu guidelines for e coli in irrigation water indicate levels between 1000 and 10 000 cfu 100 ml for vegetables that are likely to be eaten uncooked and where the irrigation water comes into direct contact with the edible portions of the vegetable then the guideline for e coli in irrigation water is 100 cfu 100 ml european commission 2017 the results in the field trial showed that the application of uv or f uv are promising technologies to disinfect irrigation water for agriculture however once the water has been disinfected with physical methods such as uv or f uv it is susceptible to re contamination if not used directly since a residual effect from the disinfection technology is not available the use of filters may also cause additional stress on the technology if proper maintenance is not followed and biofilms form therefore the set up and application of uv disinfection should be designed to avoid potential re contamination overall uv disinfection of the irrigation water is a promising technology to disinfect alternative irrigation water sources like surface water the use of this technology to treat recycled irrigation water and support the circular economy concept in food systems should be carefully evaluated the outcomes of this research are also of relevance to upcoming eu regulations on the minimum requirements for the quality of reused water for agricultural irrigation it is expected that a water disinfection technology would be needed to ensure the minimum requirements for microbiological safety 4 conclusions the laboratory study performed showed that the tested doses of uv disinfection 313 545 j m2 resulted in a 2 3 log reduction of e coli in both tap and surface water while other disinfection technologies showed e coli reductions from 3 to 4 log the study also considered the differences in capex and opex for ozone uf and uv uv resulted in the lowest costs per m3 of water even though ozone and uf reduced e coli in surface water they were calculated to be less cost effective than uv which motivated the evaluation of uv in the field trial furthermore the study showed that the application of uv in the field is feasible and uv water disinfection is an effective technology against bacterial foodborne microorganisms like e coli to treat surface water used for irrigating leafy greens overall the study describes for the first time the efficacy of using several combinations of water disinfection technologies to treat irrigation water as well as the economics of water disinfection technologies ozone uf and uv the results showed that the most suitable technology for the disinfection of surface water used to irrigate leafy greens was uv uv can be used to treat surface water intended to irrigate leafy greens if care is taken to prevent any re contamination of already treated water and if the doses are adjusted to the type of the irrigation water to be treated further research into the technical feasibility of the water disinfection technologies implemented on site at the full scale including for promising cases like uv water disinfection needs to be further piloted and substantiated with

10348,water saving irrigation technology is an effective way for agriculture to adapt to the arid climate shortening farmers waiting times to adopt such technology is important for saving water resources and stabilizing agricultural production this study analyzed the impact of capital endowment on xinjiang cotton farmers adoption willingness adoption decisions and waiting time results showed that capital endowments significantly affect cotton farmers adoption of water saving technologies wst in all dimensions specifically the scale of cotton planting had a significant positive impact on the willingness and decision of cotton farmers to adopt wst and it could significantly reduce the adoption wait time simultaneously neighbors adoption decisions policy subsidies and membership of a cooperative could reduce cotton farmers wait times land transfer was one of the livelihood strategies cotton farmers used to adjust household resource allocations or to adapt to arid climate land rental also could help reduce the wait time for wst these results and impacts provided policy optimization direction to reduce the waiting time of farmers to adopt water saving technology which was helpful to save agricultural water and for farmers adapt to drought climate change quickly at the end of the study combined with the situation of china from the crop planting structure land system reform and effective community governance we discussed several research directions to improve farmers drought climate adaptability keywords arid climates capital endowment land transfer waiting time water saving technology 1 introduction a continuous rise in global average temperatures would exacerbate the negative impact of an arid climate on human and ecological environments leading to greater water scarcity for agricultural purposes penner et al 2001 root et al 2003 lobell and field 2007 however population growth urban development and industrial progress were difficult to sustain without agricultural sector support as a result agriculture used most of the world s available water resources today iglesias and garrote 2015 for example in europe iglesias and garrote 2015 the united states frisvold and bai 2016 india larson et al 2015 ethiopia and south africa bryan et al 2009 the agriculture accounted for about 60 of the total social water consumption and more than 90 in some regions china was the world s most populous agricultural country to save water in agriculture the chinese government had increased its financial input into the sector at an annual rate of nearly 10 since 2012 to strengthen the construction of rural water conservancy facilities and popularize water saving technologies wst in agriculture general office of the state council 2012 as of 2018 china s agricultural water consumption was still as high as 369 31 billion m3 accounting for 61 4 of the total social water use ministry of water resources 2019 studies show that low adoption rates were an important factor restricting the effectiveness of wst blanke et al 2007 huang et al 2017 undoubtedly increasing farmers adoption rates of wst had a positive impact on increasing yields and income huang et al 2017 giorgi and lionello 2008 iglesias and garrote 2015 concurrently saving water resources was conducive to improving the ecological environment and maintaining sustainable economic and social development root et al 2003 blanke et al 2007 iglesias and garrote 2015 how to improve farmers adoption of water saving irrigation technology has become the focus of research technical factors burton and lim 2005 economic effects blanke et al 2007 zou et al 2013 burnham et al 2015 social capital conley and udry 2010 cofré bravo et al 2019 government policies chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 moucheng et al 2018 and family endowment hadebe 2016 zhang et al 2019 were all considered important factors affecting farmers adoption of wst burton and lim 2005 believed that agriculture in the process of adapting to climate changes depended more on the continuous technological development of agricultural enterprises and the country thus the technical difficulty and cost benefit estimation of projects were important factors affecting agricultural technology extension blanke et al 2007 showed that farmers understanding of wst such as the cost benefit and operation difficulty significantly affected their adoption behaviors zou et al 2013 compared the cost benefit of four types of agricultural irrigation technologies i e sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation low pressure pipe irrigation li and channel lining finding that farmers were more likely to be affected by the return on investment when adopting wst and that li was more suitable for promotion in arid areas according to person et al 2017 social capital could promote the cooperative behavior of farmers and improve the management capacity of community water resources through communication networks community norms and social trust chai and zeng 2018 found that communities farmers transfer external resources to the community family through social capital which could increase the wst adoption rate and promote the development of agricultural irrigation systems conley and udry s 2010 research showed that information exchanges between farmers was the main channel for obtaining agricultural production information and adjusting agricultural inputs or technology adoption different network structures would affect farmers social capital which then affects agricultural innovation and the adoption of new technologies cofré bravo et al 2019 in the indian study larson et al 2015 identified financial constraints and social networks as the main factors affecting farmers adoption of wst in their study involving small farmers in china burnham et al 2015 discovered that operation scale social capital market risk and property rights significantly affect farmers adoption of wst according to chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 farmers adoption of water saving measures was not only a technical issue but also influenced by social behaviors economic constraints and institutional frameworks hadebe 2016 hence hadebe 2016 believed that smallholder irrigation technology promotion had become a means of poverty reduction and that preferential policies resource endowment capacity rights restrictions and opportunities were the main factors influencing smallholder technology adoption zhang et al 2019 arrived at similar conclusions from a study of farmers used water saving irrigation technology in metropolitan suburbs moucheng et al 2018 believed that by paying ecological compensation to farmers it was possible to improve livelihood endowments thereby improving agricultural water systems and ecological service levels however most studies showed that the key factors affecting the adoption of wst were related to differences in farmer family endowment hadebe 2016 moucheng et al 2018 cofré bravo et al 2019 such as farm size land type and household labor force would influence the adoption of agricultural water saving technologies jara rojas et al 2012 a literature review revealed objective differences in the climate environment human society and production mode of each country or region which might affect farmers adoption of wst presently scholars had conducted abundant research on the factors affecting farmers adoption of wst but relatively few studies analyzed waiting time in recent years in the face of an increasingly severe dry climate which had caused a huge impact on agricultural production the xinjiang government had continued to increase financial input and strengthen the construction of agricultural water conservancy facilities but the comprehensive functional benefits of water saving demonstration base were not fully reflected ye et al 2015 increasing the adoption rate of wst for farmers had become an important breakthrough to solve the current dilemma in 2018 our survey in xinjiang found that more than 90 of cotton farmers used low pressure pipe irrigation technology in the following content we used wst to represent the water saving technologies adopted by farmers in practical production wst works in tandem with other technologies to deliver all its advantages generally the adoption of wst required the use of horizontal lasers to flatten the land and the use of soluble fertilizers to improve water efficiency in the early stages while facing potential surges in production costs small farmers required an observation period and evaluation time long or short from their first understanding of wst to their actual adoption of it which we call the waiting time how to reduce farmers waiting times played an important role in promoting wst and adapting to the arid climate to further compare the behavioral differences behind cotton farmers adoption of wst we proceeded in three steps first we analyzed the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst second we analyzed the decision making process whether to adopt wst third we analyzed the waiting time for cotton farmers to adopt wst 2 study area and data 2 1 study area xinjiang china s province with the largest administrative area is one of the driest regions with an annual average rainfall of 163 3 mm and an annual average temperature of 10 6 the southern part of xinjiang is the most arid region with an average annual precipitation of only 86 6 mm and an average annual temperature of 13 4 the drought in northern xinjiang is relatively light with an average annual precipitation of 222 9 mm and an average annual temperature of 8 5 statistics bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2018 xinjiang is inhabited by 56 ethnic groups whose customs cultures and agricultural productions are quite different xinjiang s social and economic development is less developed in 2017 the disposable income of rural residents was 11 045 3 yuan ranking 24th in china this makes it challenging for the local government to promote wst according to the arid climate conditions in xinjiang the chinese government promotes cotton with strong drought resistance by 2017 the cotton sown area in xinjiang had reached 2217 5 ha accounting for 69 4 of the country s total area the cotton output was 4 566 million tons accounting for 80 8 of the country s total output statistics bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2018 we randomly selected survey samples from the major cotton growing counties and cities in xinjiang firstly according to the planting area of cotton in the south and north of xinjiang 7 counties and 2 cities were selected by stratified random sampling as the questionnaire survey area secondly we selected 2 3 representative township in each county or city and selected 2 3 sample villages in each township finally we randomly selected 10 20 farmers in each village and conducted face to face questionnaire surveys the samples are distributed in yuli county wensu county awat county bachu county and shache county in the south of xinjiang and changji city manas county shawan county and usu city in the north of xinjiang the cotton planting area of these sample areas is 6 65 million hectares and the cotton yield is 1 333 37 tons accounting for 29 97 and 29 20 of the total cotton planting area and yield in xinjiang respectively see table 1 2 2 sample structure with the support of the national social science fund of china we completed the research work by using the structured interview in two times with the cooperation of village officials and farmers our team obtained 715 valid questionnaires on agricultural water saving technologies the content of the survey interview involves the individual characteristics of farmers family characteristics cotton production land transfer and the adoption behavior of agricultural water saving technology according to the sample statistics see table 2 the average age of cotton farmers is 45 years old they have rich experience in cotton planting with an average of 19 5 years of experience in cotton planting the education level of cotton farmers is relatively low as most have between primary school and junior high school educations the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst is high reaching 79 the proportion of wst used by cotton farmers is 60 the average waiting time for cotton farmers to adopt wst is 1 48 years 3 methods 3 1 conceptual framework the process of the invention and diffusion of new technologies was a special form of transmission which was influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors such as the influence of technology used by potential adopters or the influence of social culture and policy environment rogers 2003 in the technology diffusion process it usually presents an s curve at the beginning of the spread the number of individuals increased slowly and then increased rapidly when approaching the maximum saturation point it would decrease slowly this was called the rogers diffusion of innovation curve the spread time of agricultural technology was relatively long which usually took one or two years to feel the direct effect the process of learning decision making and implementing new technologies by adopters was susceptible to individual characteristics family characteristics rural communities economic constraints institutional frameworks and production environments larson et al 2015 hadebe 2016 moucheng et al 2018 cofré bravo et al 2019 we drew on the study of farmers adoptions of wst we analyzed the impact of social capital on the adoption of wst for cotton farmers from natural capital physical capital human capital economic capital and network capital miller and buys 2008 chai and zeng 2018 cofré bravo et al 2019 for example we also found in surveys and interviews that cotton farmers investment costs for adopting wst were relatively high and the smaller scale farmers were generally unwilling to invest too much money at the same time the scale effect of adopting wst for larger scale farmers was relatively more significant than that of smaller scale farmers burnham et al 2015 chang et al 2016 also pointed out in the study of two river basins in northwest china that farmers adoption of water saving technology could reduce the cost of household irrigation and meet the agricultural water demand in the long term the larger scale of farmer operations the stronger willingness to invest the lower marginal cost of adopting water saving technologies and the more significant economies of scale burnham et al 2015 chang et al 2016 therefore they had a greater willingness to adopt wst similarly the more capital that farmers had or intended to invest machinery seeds fertilizers etc the higher their expectations for stable agricultural income and the greater their willingness to adopt new technologies to improve production efficiency in addition other studies have shown that different social cultures had different influences on individual choice behaviors bagozzi and warshaw 1992 ajzen 1988 ajzen and fishbein 1980 china is a typical relational society and the social network is very complex which will affect the farmers choice behavior for instance social networks could help cotton farmers share or obtain more comprehensive information about wst through this social interaction farmers could obtain as much information as possible about a new technology the advantages and disadvantages of the technology burnham et al 2015 if this technology was a very good one then this social interaction could reduce the worries of potential adopters and increased the adoption rate the richer social capital of farmers the better they were at obtaining external resource support through various measures including reducing financial constraints obtaining effective information and improving technology which increased the adoption rate finally we also examined the impact of land transfer factors farmers who rent in land had a stronger incentive to expand their operating area the more they hope to increase agricultural income the greater their probability of using wst to increase their operating income we refer to the basic ideas of theory of planned behavior tpb at the same time we built a research framework based on the differences of farmers production decision making behavior see fig 1 the behavior of cotton farmers to adopt water saving technologies was divided into three stages adopting willingness awi adopting decision making ade and waiting time awa specifically the first stage was the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst the second stage was whether cotton farmers adopt water saving technologies and the third stage was the waiting time for cotton farmers to adopt water saving technologies in addition in terms of influencing factors we also drew on a large number of research results mainly involving technical factors burton and lim 2005 and economic effects blanke et al 2007 zou et al 2013 burnham et al 2015 social capital conley and udry 2010 cofré bravo et al 2019 government policies chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 moucheng et al 2018 and family endowment hadebe 2016 zhang et al 2019 3 2 triple hurdle model the double hurdle model was often used to analyze the formation mechanism of different decision making behaviors as well as an estimation method to measure the extent of this behavior cragg 1971 burke et al 2015 addressed the problem of sample selection bias combined the probit model and double hurdle model to analyze the behavioral characteristics of small farmers participation in the kenyan dairy market the triple hurdle model was an extension of the double hurdle model which used to analyze decision making behaviors at different stages according to the analysis framework only when farmers were willing to change from traditional irrigation technology could we observe whether they use wst so there might be sample selection errors to avoid selection errors as much as possible we drew on the research of burke et al 2015 to build the analysis model according to the research design the model constructed in the first step was used to analyze the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst the model constructed in the second step was used to analyze the decision of cotton farmers to adopt wst and the model constructed in the third step was used to analyze the waiting time of cotton farmers to adopt wst the first step is to build the following model to solve the problem of sample selection 1 w 1 i α x 1 i u 1 i 2 w 1 i 1 w 1 i 0 0 w 1 i 0 3 z 2 i β x 2 i u 2 i 4 z 2 i 1 z 2 i 0 0 z 2 i 0 eq 1 is the selection equation and eq 3 is the result equation w 1 i can be observed only if w 1 i 1 among them w 1 i indicates the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst z 2 i indicates whether cotton farmers adopt wst and w 1 i and z 2 i respectively indicate corresponding latent variables x 1 i and x 2 i respectively represent a set of explanatory variables that influence the willingness and adoption decisions of cotton farmers α and β respectively represent the parameters to be estimated corresponding to the explanatory variables u 1 i and u 2 i represent the residuals of eq 1 and eq 3 the second step is to establish the unconditional probability model according to eq 1 to eq 4 5 prob w 1 i 1 x 1 i φ α x 1 i 6 prob z 2 i 1 w 1 i 1 x 2 i x 1 i φ α x 1 i φ β x 2 i eq 5 represents the probability model of cotton farmers willingness to adopt and eq 6 represents the probability model of cotton farmers adoption of wst according to the regression results of eq 5 the inverse mill s ratio imr is constructed and regression is implemented with eq 6 and the estimated coefficient ρ ˆ of imr is obtained if the assumption that the estimation coefficient ρ ˆ 0 is true it can be proved that there is no sample selection error when the sample with w 1 i 1 is estimated using eq 6 conversely imr must be used as the control variable in eq 6 to correct any sample selection bias the third step is to estimate the waiting time impact for cotton farmers to adopt wst as follows 7 y 3 i γ x 3 i u 3 i 8 y 3 i 0 z 2 i 0 y 3 i z 2 i 0 9 e y 3 i y 3 i 0 x 3 i γ x 3 i σ 3 λ γ x 3 i σ 3 y 3 i represents the cotton farmers waiting time y 3 i represents the corresponding latent variable e represents the expected condition x 3 i represents a set of explanatory variables affecting the waiting time γ represents the parameter to be estimated and u 3 i represents the residual error the final step for each cotton farmer i is to establish the function likelihood of the triple hurdle model f w 1 i z 2 i y 3 i α β γ σ 3 10 1 φ α x 1 i 1 w 1 i 0 φ α x 1 i φ β x 2 i ϕ y 3 i γ x 3 i σ 3 σ 3 1 z 2 i 1 1 φ β x 2 i 1 z 2 i 0 1 w 1 i 1 in eq 10 1 is an indicative function if the expression in parentheses is true the value is 1 otherwise the value is 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 multicollinearity test considering that there may be internal correlations among the dimensional variables of social capital we need to make multicollinearity tests before making model estimates generally when vif 1 we can consider that there is no collinearity between the explanatory variables when vif 3 we can consider that there is a certain degree of collinearity between the explanatory variables when vif 10 we believe that there is a high degree of collinearity between the explanatory variables limited by space we present only a set of diagnoses with family income level as the explained variable the degree of collinearity between explanatory variables were within a reasonable range the maximum vif value of age was 3 50 followed by the vif of cpy 3 39 and the vif of other variables was below 3 00 which indicated that collinearity was not significant therefore we moved on to the next step of model estimation 4 2 the influence of social capital on cotton farmers adoptions of wst we used the stata15 software to complete the model estimation and measured the marginal effects of each explanatory variable as seen in table 3 the model s overall fitting effect was good among them the lr chi square value in the probit model regression was 243 72 and the log likelihood value was 244 09 in the double hurdle model regression the wald chi square value was 183 53 and the log likelihood value was 888 04 with all having passed the significance test at 1 statistical level allowing for further analysis 4 2 1 natural capital the results of the model in table 3 showed that cps had a significant positive impact on adoption willingness and the adoption decision had a significant negative impact on waiting time and passed the 1 significance level test the larger scale of cotton planting the more significant scale effect obtained by cotton farmers using wst although the initial input cost might be relatively large after the adoption of wst the traditional fertilization method was changed which effectively reduced labor costs and increased cotton production therefore the larger cotton growers the stronger their willingness to adopt wst and the higher proportion feder and size 1980 also pointed out that farm scale was an important factor influencing the adoption of new technologies by farmers frisvold and bai 2016 compared the agricultural irrigation methods of 17 western states in the united states and then they pointed out that in areas that rely more on groundwater irrigation farmers with larger farms tend to adopt water saving irrigation techniques compared with other cotton farmers their waiting time was also shorter cps had a significant positive impact on awi and ade but had a significant negative impact on awa fps had a positive impact on awi and ade but had a negative impact on the waiting time however none of them passed the significance test dft had a negative impact on awi and awa but it had not passed the significant test 4 2 2 physical capital peq had a significant positive impact on awi but had a significant negative impact on ade respectively passed the significance level test of 1 and 10 peq had a negative impact on awa but did not passed the significance test the survey found that the more productive cotton farmers had larger cotton planting areas which reflects a higher willingness to invest when they learned about these new technologies they showed a higher willingness to adopt them bryan et al 2009 found a similar conclusion in a study on ethiopia and south africa that production equipment could increase the adoption rate but there were some differences from our research our research found that in order to adopt water saving technologies cotton farmers with abundant production equipment might need to eliminate some unmatched equipment and repurchase matching equipment this investment might dispel or delay the adoption decision of cotton farmers however when they adopt wst they found that some of their original production equipment is no longer suitable therefore they need to purchase new water saving equipment which might cancel or delay their adoption decision the influence of cts on wst adopted by cotton farmers was not significant the possible reason was that with the overall improvement of china s economic and social environment especially the promotion of mobile phones and internet technologies it was relatively easy for cotton farmers to obtain information i e water saving equipment prices however the actual adoption of wst still required a large investment which might be more affected by the scale of cotton planting or other factors 4 2 3 human capital hea had a significant positive impact on awi and awa which passed the significance level test of 1 and 5 respectively hea had a negative impact on ade but it did not passed the significance level test edu only had a significant impact on ade which passed the 5 significance level test lbn had a significant negative impact on ade and had a significant positive impact on awa which passed the 1 significance level test lbn had a positive impact on the willingness to adopt but did not passed the significance level test the survey found that the more laborers in cotton farmers families the higher probability of farmers choosing labor to replace capital investment for these farmers if their family had more labor and higher health levels the probability of adopting wst was relatively low and the waiting time was relatively longer these results reinforced other related studies showing that farmer educational level health level and labor number of households played an important role in the adoption of modern technologies blanke et al 2007 alam 2015 zhang et al 2019 4 2 4 economic capital household income him significantly negatively affected the waiting time for cotton farmers to adopt water saving technologies and passed the 5 significance level test but the impact of household income on adoption intentions and adoption decisions did not passed the significance test huang et al 2017 blanke et al 2007 chai and zeng 2018 showed that household income had a significantly positive impact on farmers adoption of new technologies this was different from our research we further analyzed the reason why the estimated results were not significant which might be that the household income could only reflect the total income of cotton farmers but not the income structure and income source thus affecting the model estimation results however the estimates of wait times showed that the higher household income the shorter wait time for farmers to adopt water saving technologies in the face of the arid climate high income families were relatively more adaptable chang et al 2016 this just confirms our results 4 2 5 social network jco had a significant negative impact on awa for cotton farmers to adopt wst and passed the 5 significance level test in general the scale of operation and economic strength of cooperatives were larger or stronger than ordinary cotton farmers they would even take the initiative to seek new technologies in agricultural production to improve operating efficiency cotton farmers joining the cooperative could reduce the cost of acquiring technology and they could also obtain preferential treatment and technical guidance when purchasing water saving equipment with the cooperative therefore joining a cooperative could increase the technology adoption rate of farmers larson et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 and shorten the waiting time of farmers that is cotton farmers joining the cooperative negatively affected the waiting time this is also one of the important reasons why the chinese government vigorously develops cooperatives 5 the influence of land transfer on cotton farmers adoptions of wst r out had a significant positive impact on awi and a significant negative impact on ade and awa and it passed the significance level test above 5 faced with an arid climate and urban development opportunities cotton farmers increasingly chose to develop in cities to avoid the decline of agricultural income caused by uncertain factors their livelihood strategy shifts from agriculture to non agricultural areas such as business and dalinggong 2 2 farmers go out of their homes to do manual work for a living this was one of the main reasons for china s rising rural land transfer rate during the investigation we found that there were two main reasons for cotton farmers to rent out of their land one was that cotton farmers did not plan to plant cotton in the future and their family livelihoods had changed such cotton farmers were basically divorced from agricultural production and would not adopt agricultural water saving technologies the other was that cotton farmers had more land plots and the plot dispersion distance was relatively far from each other when farmers rent out the farther plots it could reduce the cost of field management and protection to a certain extent increased the degree of land intensification and it was more likely to reduce production cost technology mzoughi 2011 zhang et al 2019 therefore there was a greater probability of these farmers adopting water saving technologies and a shorter wait time r in had a significant positive impact on awi and ade but had a negative impact on awa and it passed the 1 significance level test the farmers who transferred to the land were dedicated to expanding the cotton planting area they indicated that they were more willing to engage in agricultural production and increase agricultural investments in the future faced with arid climates these cotton farmers were more willing to adopt wst to obtain scale benefits therefore their waiting time would be shorter 6 the influence of other factors on cotton farmers adoptions of wst psu had a significant positive impact on awi but a significant negative impact on ade and awa which passed the 1 significance level test rogers 2003 identified in the diffusion process of new technology that the number of people in the initial stage might be small in the medium term the promotion of technology was recognized by the target group and the number of people who adopt it would increase rapidly in the later period the number of people that adopted would show a downward trend this was also the case for cotton farmers who adopt wst in the early stages of wst promotions the government provided some financial subsidies for cotton farmers but most cotton farmers still would not upgrade in the middle and late stages when cotton farmers see the advantages of using water saving technology in increasing cotton production reducing costs and saving water resources they would actively adopt it but by this time the government had not provided financial subsidies or provided very little subsidies this similar phenomenon had also appeared in the process of promoting new agricultural technologies in other countries conley and udry 2010 karlan et al 2014 larson et al 2015 nad had a significant positive impact on ade but had a significant negative impact on awa which passed the significance level test of 5 and 1 respectively in china s rural society people get together in their spare time to exchange information which usually includes sharing some agricultural production experiences in the communication process farmers who first adopt technology would quickly relay the advantages and disadvantages of technology to other farmers when cotton farmers heard about the advantages of wst from their neighbors the probability of them using wst increases significantly which then reduced the waiting time however estimates showed that nad positively affected awi but did not pass the significance test bagozzi and warshaw 1992 found that due to the influence of different cultural backgrounds the influence of individual willingness on their behaviors would be different such cognitive dissonance did exist especially between climate change and environmental adaptation behaviors and led to the phenomenon of inconsistencies in individual intentions and behaviors eleonora et al 2015 such inconsistencies between willingness and behavior in adapting to climate change in arid areas and adopting water saving technologies might be the reason why the model estimates were not significant cpy and nat had no significant effect on the adoption of wst by cotton farmers 7 limitations the data used in this study are cross sectional data which may limit our further analysis of the long term effects of cotton farmers adoption of water saving technology behaviors when faced with the evolution of the arid climate facing the arid climate change cotton farmers adopt water saving technologies to improve the adaptability of agricultural production but the evolution of their family s livelihood strategy need require two three or more years of adjustment and adaptation since our research only used one year s data it was difficult to observe the long term trend of cotton farmers livelihood strategy evolution and the stability of the adaptation effect when analyzing the factors affecting cotton farmers adoption of water saving technologies there may also be limitations in the process of index selection for example during our literature analysis we found that the ease of use and usefulness of wst was considered a key factor roncoli et al 2002 bryan et al 2009 our research in southern xinjiang found that the government attached great importance to farmers technical training and carried out training activities at least twice a year farmers generally had a good understanding of the ease of use and usefulness of wst which was not a key factor affecting their adoption behavior after comprehensive consideration we did not include this indicator when estimating the model which may affect the credibility of our result 8 conclusions and outlook xinjiang is one of china s areas with the most serious drought the arid climate not only brings inconvenience to local people s lives but also has a huge adverse impact on agricultural production for example using the survey data from the 715 xinjiang cotton farmers we analyzed the impact of capital endowments on farmers willingness to adopt decision making and waiting time the results showed that the capital endowment of cotton farmers had a significant impact on the adoption of wst in all dimensions specifically the most significant factors that affect the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst were the cotton planting scale land transfer policy subsidies and production equipment the most significant factors influencing the rate of cotton farmers to adopt wst were the cotton planting scale education level neighbor adoption and cotton income proportion the most significant factors affecting the reduction of waiting time to adopt wst were the cotton planting scale neighbor adoption policy subsidies and joining cooperatives in addition to social capital neighbor adoption and policy subsidy were the main external factors that influence cotton farmers to adopt wst furthermore land transfer was one of the livelihood strategies for cotton farmers to adjust household resource allocation or adapt to arid climate change moreover it significantly influenced the adoption of wst whether renting in or renting out land and helped to reduce the waiting time for adopting wst in order to promote the extension of agricultural wst and reduce the waiting time for farmers to adopt wst our research has several policy implications first the government should assist farmers with expanding their planting scale and improving the operation efficiency of farmers who adopted wst second they should expand the dispersion of water saving pilot samples and improve the driving effects of promotion and demonstration third the government should provide wst to farmers who adopt wst for two consecutive years to alleviate the pressure of short term investment by farmers fourth they should standardize the operations and management of rural cooperatives strengthen the interaction of production technologies and provide agricultural information to small farmers fifth the government should establish the rural land transfer market to assist small farmers to develop moderate scale operation which can increase their technology adoption rate and adaptability adopting agricultural water saving technology is one of the most effective ways for farmers to adapt to arid climate changes and it is also an important reason why the government continues to promote this technology we compared similar research to find that farmers had affirmed the advancement and usefulness of agricultural water saving technology the main reason why most of them did not adopt this technology was that the investment cost was too high and the capital was too short especially small farmers the willingness to invest in this area was very low larson et al 2015 besides the per capita farmland area of chinese farmers was very small 0 09 ha and the land was the property of the collective farmers did not have the ownership of land and the land could not flow freely blocking the way for farmers to mortgage their land to the bank to obtain funds such a land system would also affect farmers investment in fixed equipment and the adoption of water saving technologies sekhri 2012 iglesias et al 2012 chai and zeng 2018 in this case deepening the reform of the rural land system was worth exploring but it was also quite difficult blanke et al 2007 iglesias and garrote 2015 chai and zeng 2018 our research focused on how to reduce the waiting time for farmers to adopt agricultural water saving technologies which was not only conducive to improving technology promotion policies but also the key to achieving efficient use of water resources and sustainable agricultural development of course based on the water demand of crops we should restrict the planting of high water consumption crops in arid areas strengthen the time management of agricultural water and optimize the spatial structure of crop water use this represents one of the effective ways to cope with an arid climate change and the adaptability of agriculture on the other hand the direction worthy of research is to analyze the decision making behavior of farmers participation in agricultural water saving from the perspective of collective action logic and then strengthen grassroots governance and improve agricultural water performance management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

10348,water saving irrigation technology is an effective way for agriculture to adapt to the arid climate shortening farmers waiting times to adopt such technology is important for saving water resources and stabilizing agricultural production this study analyzed the impact of capital endowment on xinjiang cotton farmers adoption willingness adoption decisions and waiting time results showed that capital endowments significantly affect cotton farmers adoption of water saving technologies wst in all dimensions specifically the scale of cotton planting had a significant positive impact on the willingness and decision of cotton farmers to adopt wst and it could significantly reduce the adoption wait time simultaneously neighbors adoption decisions policy subsidies and membership of a cooperative could reduce cotton farmers wait times land transfer was one of the livelihood strategies cotton farmers used to adjust household resource allocations or to adapt to arid climate land rental also could help reduce the wait time for wst these results and impacts provided policy optimization direction to reduce the waiting time of farmers to adopt water saving technology which was helpful to save agricultural water and for farmers adapt to drought climate change quickly at the end of the study combined with the situation of china from the crop planting structure land system reform and effective community governance we discussed several research directions to improve farmers drought climate adaptability keywords arid climates capital endowment land transfer waiting time water saving technology 1 introduction a continuous rise in global average temperatures would exacerbate the negative impact of an arid climate on human and ecological environments leading to greater water scarcity for agricultural purposes penner et al 2001 root et al 2003 lobell and field 2007 however population growth urban development and industrial progress were difficult to sustain without agricultural sector support as a result agriculture used most of the world s available water resources today iglesias and garrote 2015 for example in europe iglesias and garrote 2015 the united states frisvold and bai 2016 india larson et al 2015 ethiopia and south africa bryan et al 2009 the agriculture accounted for about 60 of the total social water consumption and more than 90 in some regions china was the world s most populous agricultural country to save water in agriculture the chinese government had increased its financial input into the sector at an annual rate of nearly 10 since 2012 to strengthen the construction of rural water conservancy facilities and popularize water saving technologies wst in agriculture general office of the state council 2012 as of 2018 china s agricultural water consumption was still as high as 369 31 billion m3 accounting for 61 4 of the total social water use ministry of water resources 2019 studies show that low adoption rates were an important factor restricting the effectiveness of wst blanke et al 2007 huang et al 2017 undoubtedly increasing farmers adoption rates of wst had a positive impact on increasing yields and income huang et al 2017 giorgi and lionello 2008 iglesias and garrote 2015 concurrently saving water resources was conducive to improving the ecological environment and maintaining sustainable economic and social development root et al 2003 blanke et al 2007 iglesias and garrote 2015 how to improve farmers adoption of water saving irrigation technology has become the focus of research technical factors burton and lim 2005 economic effects blanke et al 2007 zou et al 2013 burnham et al 2015 social capital conley and udry 2010 cofré bravo et al 2019 government policies chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 moucheng et al 2018 and family endowment hadebe 2016 zhang et al 2019 were all considered important factors affecting farmers adoption of wst burton and lim 2005 believed that agriculture in the process of adapting to climate changes depended more on the continuous technological development of agricultural enterprises and the country thus the technical difficulty and cost benefit estimation of projects were important factors affecting agricultural technology extension blanke et al 2007 showed that farmers understanding of wst such as the cost benefit and operation difficulty significantly affected their adoption behaviors zou et al 2013 compared the cost benefit of four types of agricultural irrigation technologies i e sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation low pressure pipe irrigation li and channel lining finding that farmers were more likely to be affected by the return on investment when adopting wst and that li was more suitable for promotion in arid areas according to person et al 2017 social capital could promote the cooperative behavior of farmers and improve the management capacity of community water resources through communication networks community norms and social trust chai and zeng 2018 found that communities farmers transfer external resources to the community family through social capital which could increase the wst adoption rate and promote the development of agricultural irrigation systems conley and udry s 2010 research showed that information exchanges between farmers was the main channel for obtaining agricultural production information and adjusting agricultural inputs or technology adoption different network structures would affect farmers social capital which then affects agricultural innovation and the adoption of new technologies cofré bravo et al 2019 in the indian study larson et al 2015 identified financial constraints and social networks as the main factors affecting farmers adoption of wst in their study involving small farmers in china burnham et al 2015 discovered that operation scale social capital market risk and property rights significantly affect farmers adoption of wst according to chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 farmers adoption of water saving measures was not only a technical issue but also influenced by social behaviors economic constraints and institutional frameworks hadebe 2016 hence hadebe 2016 believed that smallholder irrigation technology promotion had become a means of poverty reduction and that preferential policies resource endowment capacity rights restrictions and opportunities were the main factors influencing smallholder technology adoption zhang et al 2019 arrived at similar conclusions from a study of farmers used water saving irrigation technology in metropolitan suburbs moucheng et al 2018 believed that by paying ecological compensation to farmers it was possible to improve livelihood endowments thereby improving agricultural water systems and ecological service levels however most studies showed that the key factors affecting the adoption of wst were related to differences in farmer family endowment hadebe 2016 moucheng et al 2018 cofré bravo et al 2019 such as farm size land type and household labor force would influence the adoption of agricultural water saving technologies jara rojas et al 2012 a literature review revealed objective differences in the climate environment human society and production mode of each country or region which might affect farmers adoption of wst presently scholars had conducted abundant research on the factors affecting farmers adoption of wst but relatively few studies analyzed waiting time in recent years in the face of an increasingly severe dry climate which had caused a huge impact on agricultural production the xinjiang government had continued to increase financial input and strengthen the construction of agricultural water conservancy facilities but the comprehensive functional benefits of water saving demonstration base were not fully reflected ye et al 2015 increasing the adoption rate of wst for farmers had become an important breakthrough to solve the current dilemma in 2018 our survey in xinjiang found that more than 90 of cotton farmers used low pressure pipe irrigation technology in the following content we used wst to represent the water saving technologies adopted by farmers in practical production wst works in tandem with other technologies to deliver all its advantages generally the adoption of wst required the use of horizontal lasers to flatten the land and the use of soluble fertilizers to improve water efficiency in the early stages while facing potential surges in production costs small farmers required an observation period and evaluation time long or short from their first understanding of wst to their actual adoption of it which we call the waiting time how to reduce farmers waiting times played an important role in promoting wst and adapting to the arid climate to further compare the behavioral differences behind cotton farmers adoption of wst we proceeded in three steps first we analyzed the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst second we analyzed the decision making process whether to adopt wst third we analyzed the waiting time for cotton farmers to adopt wst 2 study area and data 2 1 study area xinjiang china s province with the largest administrative area is one of the driest regions with an annual average rainfall of 163 3 mm and an annual average temperature of 10 6 the southern part of xinjiang is the most arid region with an average annual precipitation of only 86 6 mm and an average annual temperature of 13 4 the drought in northern xinjiang is relatively light with an average annual precipitation of 222 9 mm and an average annual temperature of 8 5 statistics bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2018 xinjiang is inhabited by 56 ethnic groups whose customs cultures and agricultural productions are quite different xinjiang s social and economic development is less developed in 2017 the disposable income of rural residents was 11 045 3 yuan ranking 24th in china this makes it challenging for the local government to promote wst according to the arid climate conditions in xinjiang the chinese government promotes cotton with strong drought resistance by 2017 the cotton sown area in xinjiang had reached 2217 5 ha accounting for 69 4 of the country s total area the cotton output was 4 566 million tons accounting for 80 8 of the country s total output statistics bureau of xinjiang uygur autonomous region 2018 we randomly selected survey samples from the major cotton growing counties and cities in xinjiang firstly according to the planting area of cotton in the south and north of xinjiang 7 counties and 2 cities were selected by stratified random sampling as the questionnaire survey area secondly we selected 2 3 representative township in each county or city and selected 2 3 sample villages in each township finally we randomly selected 10 20 farmers in each village and conducted face to face questionnaire surveys the samples are distributed in yuli county wensu county awat county bachu county and shache county in the south of xinjiang and changji city manas county shawan county and usu city in the north of xinjiang the cotton planting area of these sample areas is 6 65 million hectares and the cotton yield is 1 333 37 tons accounting for 29 97 and 29 20 of the total cotton planting area and yield in xinjiang respectively see table 1 2 2 sample structure with the support of the national social science fund of china we completed the research work by using the structured interview in two times with the cooperation of village officials and farmers our team obtained 715 valid questionnaires on agricultural water saving technologies the content of the survey interview involves the individual characteristics of farmers family characteristics cotton production land transfer and the adoption behavior of agricultural water saving technology according to the sample statistics see table 2 the average age of cotton farmers is 45 years old they have rich experience in cotton planting with an average of 19 5 years of experience in cotton planting the education level of cotton farmers is relatively low as most have between primary school and junior high school educations the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst is high reaching 79 the proportion of wst used by cotton farmers is 60 the average waiting time for cotton farmers to adopt wst is 1 48 years 3 methods 3 1 conceptual framework the process of the invention and diffusion of new technologies was a special form of transmission which was influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors such as the influence of technology used by potential adopters or the influence of social culture and policy environment rogers 2003 in the technology diffusion process it usually presents an s curve at the beginning of the spread the number of individuals increased slowly and then increased rapidly when approaching the maximum saturation point it would decrease slowly this was called the rogers diffusion of innovation curve the spread time of agricultural technology was relatively long which usually took one or two years to feel the direct effect the process of learning decision making and implementing new technologies by adopters was susceptible to individual characteristics family characteristics rural communities economic constraints institutional frameworks and production environments larson et al 2015 hadebe 2016 moucheng et al 2018 cofré bravo et al 2019 we drew on the study of farmers adoptions of wst we analyzed the impact of social capital on the adoption of wst for cotton farmers from natural capital physical capital human capital economic capital and network capital miller and buys 2008 chai and zeng 2018 cofré bravo et al 2019 for example we also found in surveys and interviews that cotton farmers investment costs for adopting wst were relatively high and the smaller scale farmers were generally unwilling to invest too much money at the same time the scale effect of adopting wst for larger scale farmers was relatively more significant than that of smaller scale farmers burnham et al 2015 chang et al 2016 also pointed out in the study of two river basins in northwest china that farmers adoption of water saving technology could reduce the cost of household irrigation and meet the agricultural water demand in the long term the larger scale of farmer operations the stronger willingness to invest the lower marginal cost of adopting water saving technologies and the more significant economies of scale burnham et al 2015 chang et al 2016 therefore they had a greater willingness to adopt wst similarly the more capital that farmers had or intended to invest machinery seeds fertilizers etc the higher their expectations for stable agricultural income and the greater their willingness to adopt new technologies to improve production efficiency in addition other studies have shown that different social cultures had different influences on individual choice behaviors bagozzi and warshaw 1992 ajzen 1988 ajzen and fishbein 1980 china is a typical relational society and the social network is very complex which will affect the farmers choice behavior for instance social networks could help cotton farmers share or obtain more comprehensive information about wst through this social interaction farmers could obtain as much information as possible about a new technology the advantages and disadvantages of the technology burnham et al 2015 if this technology was a very good one then this social interaction could reduce the worries of potential adopters and increased the adoption rate the richer social capital of farmers the better they were at obtaining external resource support through various measures including reducing financial constraints obtaining effective information and improving technology which increased the adoption rate finally we also examined the impact of land transfer factors farmers who rent in land had a stronger incentive to expand their operating area the more they hope to increase agricultural income the greater their probability of using wst to increase their operating income we refer to the basic ideas of theory of planned behavior tpb at the same time we built a research framework based on the differences of farmers production decision making behavior see fig 1 the behavior of cotton farmers to adopt water saving technologies was divided into three stages adopting willingness awi adopting decision making ade and waiting time awa specifically the first stage was the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst the second stage was whether cotton farmers adopt water saving technologies and the third stage was the waiting time for cotton farmers to adopt water saving technologies in addition in terms of influencing factors we also drew on a large number of research results mainly involving technical factors burton and lim 2005 and economic effects blanke et al 2007 zou et al 2013 burnham et al 2015 social capital conley and udry 2010 cofré bravo et al 2019 government policies chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 moucheng et al 2018 and family endowment hadebe 2016 zhang et al 2019 3 2 triple hurdle model the double hurdle model was often used to analyze the formation mechanism of different decision making behaviors as well as an estimation method to measure the extent of this behavior cragg 1971 burke et al 2015 addressed the problem of sample selection bias combined the probit model and double hurdle model to analyze the behavioral characteristics of small farmers participation in the kenyan dairy market the triple hurdle model was an extension of the double hurdle model which used to analyze decision making behaviors at different stages according to the analysis framework only when farmers were willing to change from traditional irrigation technology could we observe whether they use wst so there might be sample selection errors to avoid selection errors as much as possible we drew on the research of burke et al 2015 to build the analysis model according to the research design the model constructed in the first step was used to analyze the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst the model constructed in the second step was used to analyze the decision of cotton farmers to adopt wst and the model constructed in the third step was used to analyze the waiting time of cotton farmers to adopt wst the first step is to build the following model to solve the problem of sample selection 1 w 1 i α x 1 i u 1 i 2 w 1 i 1 w 1 i 0 0 w 1 i 0 3 z 2 i β x 2 i u 2 i 4 z 2 i 1 z 2 i 0 0 z 2 i 0 eq 1 is the selection equation and eq 3 is the result equation w 1 i can be observed only if w 1 i 1 among them w 1 i indicates the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst z 2 i indicates whether cotton farmers adopt wst and w 1 i and z 2 i respectively indicate corresponding latent variables x 1 i and x 2 i respectively represent a set of explanatory variables that influence the willingness and adoption decisions of cotton farmers α and β respectively represent the parameters to be estimated corresponding to the explanatory variables u 1 i and u 2 i represent the residuals of eq 1 and eq 3 the second step is to establish the unconditional probability model according to eq 1 to eq 4 5 prob w 1 i 1 x 1 i φ α x 1 i 6 prob z 2 i 1 w 1 i 1 x 2 i x 1 i φ α x 1 i φ β x 2 i eq 5 represents the probability model of cotton farmers willingness to adopt and eq 6 represents the probability model of cotton farmers adoption of wst according to the regression results of eq 5 the inverse mill s ratio imr is constructed and regression is implemented with eq 6 and the estimated coefficient ρ ˆ of imr is obtained if the assumption that the estimation coefficient ρ ˆ 0 is true it can be proved that there is no sample selection error when the sample with w 1 i 1 is estimated using eq 6 conversely imr must be used as the control variable in eq 6 to correct any sample selection bias the third step is to estimate the waiting time impact for cotton farmers to adopt wst as follows 7 y 3 i γ x 3 i u 3 i 8 y 3 i 0 z 2 i 0 y 3 i z 2 i 0 9 e y 3 i y 3 i 0 x 3 i γ x 3 i σ 3 λ γ x 3 i σ 3 y 3 i represents the cotton farmers waiting time y 3 i represents the corresponding latent variable e represents the expected condition x 3 i represents a set of explanatory variables affecting the waiting time γ represents the parameter to be estimated and u 3 i represents the residual error the final step for each cotton farmer i is to establish the function likelihood of the triple hurdle model f w 1 i z 2 i y 3 i α β γ σ 3 10 1 φ α x 1 i 1 w 1 i 0 φ α x 1 i φ β x 2 i ϕ y 3 i γ x 3 i σ 3 σ 3 1 z 2 i 1 1 φ β x 2 i 1 z 2 i 0 1 w 1 i 1 in eq 10 1 is an indicative function if the expression in parentheses is true the value is 1 otherwise the value is 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 multicollinearity test considering that there may be internal correlations among the dimensional variables of social capital we need to make multicollinearity tests before making model estimates generally when vif 1 we can consider that there is no collinearity between the explanatory variables when vif 3 we can consider that there is a certain degree of collinearity between the explanatory variables when vif 10 we believe that there is a high degree of collinearity between the explanatory variables limited by space we present only a set of diagnoses with family income level as the explained variable the degree of collinearity between explanatory variables were within a reasonable range the maximum vif value of age was 3 50 followed by the vif of cpy 3 39 and the vif of other variables was below 3 00 which indicated that collinearity was not significant therefore we moved on to the next step of model estimation 4 2 the influence of social capital on cotton farmers adoptions of wst we used the stata15 software to complete the model estimation and measured the marginal effects of each explanatory variable as seen in table 3 the model s overall fitting effect was good among them the lr chi square value in the probit model regression was 243 72 and the log likelihood value was 244 09 in the double hurdle model regression the wald chi square value was 183 53 and the log likelihood value was 888 04 with all having passed the significance test at 1 statistical level allowing for further analysis 4 2 1 natural capital the results of the model in table 3 showed that cps had a significant positive impact on adoption willingness and the adoption decision had a significant negative impact on waiting time and passed the 1 significance level test the larger scale of cotton planting the more significant scale effect obtained by cotton farmers using wst although the initial input cost might be relatively large after the adoption of wst the traditional fertilization method was changed which effectively reduced labor costs and increased cotton production therefore the larger cotton growers the stronger their willingness to adopt wst and the higher proportion feder and size 1980 also pointed out that farm scale was an important factor influencing the adoption of new technologies by farmers frisvold and bai 2016 compared the agricultural irrigation methods of 17 western states in the united states and then they pointed out that in areas that rely more on groundwater irrigation farmers with larger farms tend to adopt water saving irrigation techniques compared with other cotton farmers their waiting time was also shorter cps had a significant positive impact on awi and ade but had a significant negative impact on awa fps had a positive impact on awi and ade but had a negative impact on the waiting time however none of them passed the significance test dft had a negative impact on awi and awa but it had not passed the significant test 4 2 2 physical capital peq had a significant positive impact on awi but had a significant negative impact on ade respectively passed the significance level test of 1 and 10 peq had a negative impact on awa but did not passed the significance test the survey found that the more productive cotton farmers had larger cotton planting areas which reflects a higher willingness to invest when they learned about these new technologies they showed a higher willingness to adopt them bryan et al 2009 found a similar conclusion in a study on ethiopia and south africa that production equipment could increase the adoption rate but there were some differences from our research our research found that in order to adopt water saving technologies cotton farmers with abundant production equipment might need to eliminate some unmatched equipment and repurchase matching equipment this investment might dispel or delay the adoption decision of cotton farmers however when they adopt wst they found that some of their original production equipment is no longer suitable therefore they need to purchase new water saving equipment which might cancel or delay their adoption decision the influence of cts on wst adopted by cotton farmers was not significant the possible reason was that with the overall improvement of china s economic and social environment especially the promotion of mobile phones and internet technologies it was relatively easy for cotton farmers to obtain information i e water saving equipment prices however the actual adoption of wst still required a large investment which might be more affected by the scale of cotton planting or other factors 4 2 3 human capital hea had a significant positive impact on awi and awa which passed the significance level test of 1 and 5 respectively hea had a negative impact on ade but it did not passed the significance level test edu only had a significant impact on ade which passed the 5 significance level test lbn had a significant negative impact on ade and had a significant positive impact on awa which passed the 1 significance level test lbn had a positive impact on the willingness to adopt but did not passed the significance level test the survey found that the more laborers in cotton farmers families the higher probability of farmers choosing labor to replace capital investment for these farmers if their family had more labor and higher health levels the probability of adopting wst was relatively low and the waiting time was relatively longer these results reinforced other related studies showing that farmer educational level health level and labor number of households played an important role in the adoption of modern technologies blanke et al 2007 alam 2015 zhang et al 2019 4 2 4 economic capital household income him significantly negatively affected the waiting time for cotton farmers to adopt water saving technologies and passed the 5 significance level test but the impact of household income on adoption intentions and adoption decisions did not passed the significance test huang et al 2017 blanke et al 2007 chai and zeng 2018 showed that household income had a significantly positive impact on farmers adoption of new technologies this was different from our research we further analyzed the reason why the estimated results were not significant which might be that the household income could only reflect the total income of cotton farmers but not the income structure and income source thus affecting the model estimation results however the estimates of wait times showed that the higher household income the shorter wait time for farmers to adopt water saving technologies in the face of the arid climate high income families were relatively more adaptable chang et al 2016 this just confirms our results 4 2 5 social network jco had a significant negative impact on awa for cotton farmers to adopt wst and passed the 5 significance level test in general the scale of operation and economic strength of cooperatives were larger or stronger than ordinary cotton farmers they would even take the initiative to seek new technologies in agricultural production to improve operating efficiency cotton farmers joining the cooperative could reduce the cost of acquiring technology and they could also obtain preferential treatment and technical guidance when purchasing water saving equipment with the cooperative therefore joining a cooperative could increase the technology adoption rate of farmers larson et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 and shorten the waiting time of farmers that is cotton farmers joining the cooperative negatively affected the waiting time this is also one of the important reasons why the chinese government vigorously develops cooperatives 5 the influence of land transfer on cotton farmers adoptions of wst r out had a significant positive impact on awi and a significant negative impact on ade and awa and it passed the significance level test above 5 faced with an arid climate and urban development opportunities cotton farmers increasingly chose to develop in cities to avoid the decline of agricultural income caused by uncertain factors their livelihood strategy shifts from agriculture to non agricultural areas such as business and dalinggong 2 2 farmers go out of their homes to do manual work for a living this was one of the main reasons for china s rising rural land transfer rate during the investigation we found that there were two main reasons for cotton farmers to rent out of their land one was that cotton farmers did not plan to plant cotton in the future and their family livelihoods had changed such cotton farmers were basically divorced from agricultural production and would not adopt agricultural water saving technologies the other was that cotton farmers had more land plots and the plot dispersion distance was relatively far from each other when farmers rent out the farther plots it could reduce the cost of field management and protection to a certain extent increased the degree of land intensification and it was more likely to reduce production cost technology mzoughi 2011 zhang et al 2019 therefore there was a greater probability of these farmers adopting water saving technologies and a shorter wait time r in had a significant positive impact on awi and ade but had a negative impact on awa and it passed the 1 significance level test the farmers who transferred to the land were dedicated to expanding the cotton planting area they indicated that they were more willing to engage in agricultural production and increase agricultural investments in the future faced with arid climates these cotton farmers were more willing to adopt wst to obtain scale benefits therefore their waiting time would be shorter 6 the influence of other factors on cotton farmers adoptions of wst psu had a significant positive impact on awi but a significant negative impact on ade and awa which passed the 1 significance level test rogers 2003 identified in the diffusion process of new technology that the number of people in the initial stage might be small in the medium term the promotion of technology was recognized by the target group and the number of people who adopt it would increase rapidly in the later period the number of people that adopted would show a downward trend this was also the case for cotton farmers who adopt wst in the early stages of wst promotions the government provided some financial subsidies for cotton farmers but most cotton farmers still would not upgrade in the middle and late stages when cotton farmers see the advantages of using water saving technology in increasing cotton production reducing costs and saving water resources they would actively adopt it but by this time the government had not provided financial subsidies or provided very little subsidies this similar phenomenon had also appeared in the process of promoting new agricultural technologies in other countries conley and udry 2010 karlan et al 2014 larson et al 2015 nad had a significant positive impact on ade but had a significant negative impact on awa which passed the significance level test of 5 and 1 respectively in china s rural society people get together in their spare time to exchange information which usually includes sharing some agricultural production experiences in the communication process farmers who first adopt technology would quickly relay the advantages and disadvantages of technology to other farmers when cotton farmers heard about the advantages of wst from their neighbors the probability of them using wst increases significantly which then reduced the waiting time however estimates showed that nad positively affected awi but did not pass the significance test bagozzi and warshaw 1992 found that due to the influence of different cultural backgrounds the influence of individual willingness on their behaviors would be different such cognitive dissonance did exist especially between climate change and environmental adaptation behaviors and led to the phenomenon of inconsistencies in individual intentions and behaviors eleonora et al 2015 such inconsistencies between willingness and behavior in adapting to climate change in arid areas and adopting water saving technologies might be the reason why the model estimates were not significant cpy and nat had no significant effect on the adoption of wst by cotton farmers 7 limitations the data used in this study are cross sectional data which may limit our further analysis of the long term effects of cotton farmers adoption of water saving technology behaviors when faced with the evolution of the arid climate facing the arid climate change cotton farmers adopt water saving technologies to improve the adaptability of agricultural production but the evolution of their family s livelihood strategy need require two three or more years of adjustment and adaptation since our research only used one year s data it was difficult to observe the long term trend of cotton farmers livelihood strategy evolution and the stability of the adaptation effect when analyzing the factors affecting cotton farmers adoption of water saving technologies there may also be limitations in the process of index selection for example during our literature analysis we found that the ease of use and usefulness of wst was considered a key factor roncoli et al 2002 bryan et al 2009 our research in southern xinjiang found that the government attached great importance to farmers technical training and carried out training activities at least twice a year farmers generally had a good understanding of the ease of use and usefulness of wst which was not a key factor affecting their adoption behavior after comprehensive consideration we did not include this indicator when estimating the model which may affect the credibility of our result 8 conclusions and outlook xinjiang is one of china s areas with the most serious drought the arid climate not only brings inconvenience to local people s lives but also has a huge adverse impact on agricultural production for example using the survey data from the 715 xinjiang cotton farmers we analyzed the impact of capital endowments on farmers willingness to adopt decision making and waiting time the results showed that the capital endowment of cotton farmers had a significant impact on the adoption of wst in all dimensions specifically the most significant factors that affect the willingness of cotton farmers to adopt wst were the cotton planting scale land transfer policy subsidies and production equipment the most significant factors influencing the rate of cotton farmers to adopt wst were the cotton planting scale education level neighbor adoption and cotton income proportion the most significant factors affecting the reduction of waiting time to adopt wst were the cotton planting scale neighbor adoption policy subsidies and joining cooperatives in addition to social capital neighbor adoption and policy subsidy were the main external factors that influence cotton farmers to adopt wst furthermore land transfer was one of the livelihood strategies for cotton farmers to adjust household resource allocation or adapt to arid climate change moreover it significantly influenced the adoption of wst whether renting in or renting out land and helped to reduce the waiting time for adopting wst in order to promote the extension of agricultural wst and reduce the waiting time for farmers to adopt wst our research has several policy implications first the government should assist farmers with expanding their planting scale and improving the operation efficiency of farmers who adopted wst second they should expand the dispersion of water saving pilot samples and improve the driving effects of promotion and demonstration third the government should provide wst to farmers who adopt wst for two consecutive years to alleviate the pressure of short term investment by farmers fourth they should standardize the operations and management of rural cooperatives strengthen the interaction of production technologies and provide agricultural information to small farmers fifth the government should establish the rural land transfer market to assist small farmers to develop moderate scale operation which can increase their technology adoption rate and adaptability adopting agricultural water saving technology is one of the most effective ways for farmers to adapt to arid climate changes and it is also an important reason why the government continues to promote this technology we compared similar research to find that farmers had affirmed the advancement and usefulness of agricultural water saving technology the main reason why most of them did not adopt this technology was that the investment cost was too high and the capital was too short especially small farmers the willingness to invest in this area was very low larson et al 2015 besides the per capita farmland area of chinese farmers was very small 0 09 ha and the land was the property of the collective farmers did not have the ownership of land and the land could not flow freely blocking the way for farmers to mortgage their land to the bank to obtain funds such a land system would also affect farmers investment in fixed equipment and the adoption of water saving technologies sekhri 2012 iglesias et al 2012 chai and zeng 2018 in this case deepening the reform of the rural land system was worth exploring but it was also quite difficult blanke et al 2007 iglesias and garrote 2015 chai and zeng 2018 our research focused on how to reduce the waiting time for farmers to adopt agricultural water saving technologies which was not only conducive to improving technology promotion policies but also the key to achieving efficient use of water resources and sustainable agricultural development of course based on the water demand of crops we should restrict the planting of high water consumption crops in arid areas strengthen the time management of agricultural water and optimize the spatial structure of crop water use this represents one of the effective ways to cope with an arid climate change and the adaptability of agriculture on the other hand the direction worthy of research is to analyze the decision making behavior of farmers participation in agricultural water saving from the perspective of collective action logic and then strengthen grassroots governance and improve

and actual evapotranspiration et products from 2001 to 2018 supplied by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data respectively two agricultural drought indices i e the univariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index usmei and bivariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index bsmei were developed to reflect water stress for winter wheat our case study on the north china plain ncp indicated that the usmei could effectively monitor agricultural drought especially in autumn and winter from october to january furthermore compared with the evaporative stress index esi and soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi the correlations between the usmei and climatic yields were acceptable at the county level or site scale however for the rest of the winter wheat growing season the esi and smapi performed better than the usmei in addition the bsmei was not suitable for monitoring droughts for winter wheat because this index overestimated the drought intensity keywords soil moisture evapotranspiration univariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index agricultural drought winter wheat 1 introduction drought is one of the most devastating and far reaching disasters and has serious impacts on agricultural production economic development and human livelihoods svoboda et al 2002 shah and paulsen 2003 hao et al 2018 in recent years countries worldwide have experienced extensive property damage resulting from extremely severe drought events the 2018 drought throughout northwestern europe resulted in up to 900 million in losses for danish farmers alone world bank 2019 prolonged droughts from 2011 to 2016 resulted in more than 5 5 billion in economic losses to the agricultural sector in california medellín azuara et al 2016 in china 1 02 107 ha of drought area was caused by winter and spring drought over the northern wheat region in 2009 feng 2010 as one of the most typical regions subjected to drought in the world wmo 2012 the north china plain ncp has attracted increasing attention from geologists ecologists and meteorologists in terms of water resources cropping systems and drought monitoring shi et al 2011 yang et al 2017 sun et al 2017 gong et al 2018 wu et al 2019 shi et al 2011 emphasized that there is no further mining potential due to groundwater overexploitation in the ncp at present in addition the ncp has experienced significantly more droughts since the 1960s and more meteorological droughts will occur in the future based on entropy aided evaluation piao et al 2010 sang et al 2018 furthermore the drought pattern on the ncp is dominated by winter and spring droughts which affect the critical stage of winter wheat liu et al 2018 consequently the timely and effective monitoring of agricultural droughts on winter wheat production on the ncp is crucial for water resource management drought mitigation and even national food security from the perspective of the hydrological cycle droughts are generally classified into four categories meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought wilhite 2005 among these meteorological drought is triggered by a deficit in precipitation aghakouchak et al 2015 however agricultural drought caused by the stress of soil moisture in the root zone results in chlorophyll content losses vegetation wilting and even crop failure over time zhou et al 2017 joiner et al 2018 the onset of which may lag that of the meteorological drought depending on the previous effective soil water content heim 2002 to monitor different kinds of droughts severity or magnitude over 70 drought indices and several drought information systems have been developed rhee et al 2010 zhang and jia 2013 aghakouchak et al 2015 martínez fernández et al 2016 wmo and gwp 2016 zhang et al 2017 sun et al 2017 hao et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the well known drought indices include the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 soil moisture deficit index smdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 and the u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 which is a well known drought information system the crucial indicators to build all these drought indices and information systems include hydrological variables precipitation snow et soil moisture groundwater etc meteorological elements temperature and relative humidity and vegetation spectral characteristics and they are related to a series of univariate spi smdi etc bivariate spei esi etc multivariate or composite scaled drought condition index sdci integrated remote sensing drought monitoring index irsdi etc drought indices rhee et al 2010 farahmand et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 sun et al 2017 based on a review of previous studies two aspects need to be considered firstly agricultural drought is the result of meteorological drought in agriculture areas one of the best statistical indicators of meteorological drought is precipitation however the drought indices that include this indicator such as spi or spei may not be suitable for monitoring agriculture drought especially in irrigated areas the main reason is that irrigation leads to overestimations of drought severity by certain drought indices e g spi and spei anderson et al 2011 researchers reported that the spi in august and palmer z index in july have a close relationship with corn yield anomalies in the u s east of the 100 w meridian where irrigation is not extensively used lu et al 2017 secondly agricultural drought is affected by meteorological factors soil properties vegetation types and other factors e g field management and disease sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 hence univariate drought indices cannot accurately represent agricultural drought conditions soil moisture in the root zone and et are the most direct sources of water and water loss for crops respectively as a fundamental component of the water cycle soil moisture regulates the variation and magnitude in water and energy fluxes within the soil vegetation atmosphere system and has been widely used to monitor water deficits during agricultural droughts zhang and jia 2013 hao and aghakouchak 2014 sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2018 in addition et represents mass and energy exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere and it responds faster to water stress stomatal sensitivity than the vegetation indices aghakouchak et al 2015 joiner et al 2018 in most cases using linear weighing or nonparametric distribution function to integrate drought indicators or indices is a common approach to establishing new drought indices zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2018 however these two factors are rarely considered simultaneously to depict the drought phenomenon physically when constructing agricultural drought indices consequently it is necessary to develop a new agricultural drought index with explicit physical meaning to overcome the above mentioned issues in our study the first step was to build a bivariate drought model based on water demand crop water demand and supply effective soil moisture using actual et and soil moisture products originating from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data and european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf respectively the second step was to compare the new agricultural drought indices with the esi and the soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi bergman et al 1988 to verify the monitoring ability for typical drought events on the ncp finally the applicability of the new agricultural drought index was assessed by using the observed disaster dataset and yield dataset of winter wheat at the county level and site scale the results are expected to strengthen agricultural drought monitoring for winter wheat on the ncp 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the ncp encompasses most parts of 5 provinces hebei henan shandong jiangsu and anhui and 2 mega cities beijing and tianjin approximately 87 of the land is crop land statistic from the mcd12 q1 product of modis and the area ranges from 32 08 n to 40 23 n latitude and 112 51 e to 122 42 e longitude fig 1 winter wheat is one of the main crops grown on the ncp and provides approximately 50 of the national gross wheat yield fig 1 statistics from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china during 2000 2011 in general winter wheat is sown in early october of the previous year and harvested in early or mid june of the following year dominated by the temperate monsoon climate the ncp has a mean annual temperature of 12 8 14 9 c and a mean annual precipitation of 472 7 882 9 mm with approximately 30 occurring from october to june i e the growing season of winter wheat wu et al 2019 on the ncp drought is one of the major natural hazards since the beginning of the 21st century the total drought area of the agriculture sector has decreased significantly due to disaster management and mitigation improvements however an area greater than 2 106 hm2 has been affected by drought in 3 main provinces hebei shandong and henan on the ncp statistic from the national bureau of statistics fig 2 2 2 data sources and processing 2 2 1 soil moisture and soil database the soil moisture data from 2001 to 2008 provided by the integrated forecasting system ifs of the ecmwf https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets set i was the hres high resolution direct model output

and 1 2 89 m in this study 3 layers of soil moisture within 1 m were used and separately averaged to daily values for each layer then the volumetric soil moisture within 1 m was computed as follows 1 θ l 1 3 θ i h l where l l 1 2 and 3 is the number of soil layers for the soil moisture product θ m3 m 3 is the daily volumetric soil moisture within 0 1 m θi m3 m 3 is the daily volumetric soil

compared to the soil moisture product the soil database had a more precise soil layer distribution to acquire the corresponding soil parameters i e sand clay and soil organic matter fractions at a depth of 0 1 m for the soil moisture product the soil physical attributes in the 0 0 045 0 045 0 091 0 091 0 166 0 166 0 289 m 0 289 0 493 and 0 493 0 829 layers for the soil database were used to capture the relevant soil information the formula was as follows 2 m l 1 6 h l ρ b l m l l 1 6 h l ρ b l where l l 1 2 3 6 is the soil layer number in the soil database hl and ρbl are the depth of the soil layer m and bulk density g cm 3 in the soil database respectively ml g 100 g 1 is the fraction of sand s g 100 g 1 clay c g 100 g 1 and soil organic matter om g 100 g 1 corresponding to the soil

respectively and θfct m3 m 3 and θwpt m3 m 3 are intermediate variables in the simulation of θfc and θwp respectively it should be noted that because of simulation error in the above mentioned models these two simulated values needed to be replaced with the weighted mean values the weight was the ratio between the depth of a specific layer and 0 829 m of the field capacity and wilting point in 6 layers in the soil database when the absolute deviation between the simulated value and the weighted mean value was more than 20 2 2 2 modis data the modis data used in the study included the level 3 product mcd12q1 and the level 4 product mod16a2 https modis gsfc nasa gov data to cover the study area completely imagery from tracks h26v04 h26v05 h27v04 and h27v05 need to be acquired the mcd12q1 product provides global land cover types with a pixel size of 500 m at yearly intervals from 2001 to 2017 derived from 6 different classification schemes among these the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp as the primary land cover scheme identifies 17 classes including 11 natural vegetation classes 3 human altered classes and 3 non vegetated classes in which the classification number of croplands is 12 i e pixel value friedl and sulla menashe 2015 the mod16a2 product provides composite evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration i e reference evapotranspiration eto with a pixel size of 500 m at 8 day intervals from 2001 to 2018 the pixel values for the two variables were the sum of all 8 days within the composite period note that the last 8 day period of each year was a 5 or 6 day composite period depending on whether it was a leap year or a normal year running et al 2017 because the original coordinate systems for two products were sinusoidal the hdf eos to geotiff conversion tool heg http hdfeos org software heg php was used for mosaicking resampling nearest neighbor and reprojection transform to the geographic coordinate system to obtain new imagery with a spatial resolution of 0 1 matching the soil moisture product for a specific period then the intersection of croplands was obtained among 17 imageries from 2001 to 2017 with matlab r2014a fig 1 note that the cropland extracted via mcd12q1 was considered the planted area of winter wheat because this grain is one of the primary crops in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system on the ncp in addition the real values of et and eto were the pixel values multiplied by a scale factor 0 1 based on the imageries processed by the heg 2 2 3 precipitation historical observed precipitation data were collected by the national meteorological information centre of the china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjgx from 1965 to 2018 and the daily data were acquired from 373 meteorological stations due to missing data and site migration the meteorological stations could be used only after the following criteria were adopted in sequence 1 no missing data within an entire month 2 migration distance of the station is no more than 10 km away from the original position and 3 percentage of missing data is smaller than 1 those gaps were replaced with values on the same day from the nearest meteorological station wu et al 2019 in total 278 meteorological stations had complete time series data which were used for further drought analyses 226 meteorological stations were evenly distributed within the ncp and the remaining sites encompassed the study area fig 1 2 2 4 disaster records and winter wheat yield regional drought information derived from the yearbook of meteorological disasters in china from 2005 to 2017 depicted the start time end time extent of drought and associated losses from the perspective of meteorological drought moreover 61 agrometeorological stations fig 1 described in detail the start time end time and severity of drought every ten days for winter wheat from 2001 to 2013 on the ncp the winter wheat yield data per unit area yield included county level 265 counties from 2002 to 2011 and site scale 61 agrometeorological stations from 2002 to 2013 fig 1 yield records on the ncp crop yield is controlled by many aspects including scientific and technological improvements e g advances in breeding fertilizer pesticides and irrigation infrastructure and weather and climatic factors lu et al 2017 drought is still a primary factor that limits agricultural productivity and causes crop yield uncertainty martínez fernández et al 2016 to acquire the yield component determined by weather and climatic variability including the adverse effect of disasters detrending must be applied to remove yield trends due to scientific and technological advances for winter wheat yields per unit area yield zhang et al 2017 lu et al 2017 generally the simplest detrending method is an additive decomposition model that is defined by the following equation dong et al 2015 7 y y c y t where y per unit area yield kg hm 2 is the winter wheat yield recorded at the county level or site scale yc kg hm 2 is the climatic yield reflecting the crop yield component affected by fluctuations in climatic elements y t kg hm 2 is the trend yield reflecting yield variability induced by scientific and technological advances and t is the time sequence number to extract the climatic yield of winter wheat from the original data the trend yield was simulated with the mean linear sliding method the first step was to determine the linear regression equation in a specific moving window the formula can be written as follows 8 y i t a i b i t i 1 2 3 n k 1 where n is the sample size k is the moving step and set to 5 in the study i is the number of fitted equations t is the time sequence number and changes with i i e when i 1 t 1 2 3 k when i 2 t 2 3 4 k 1 when i n k 1 t n k 1 n k 2 n k 3 n and yi t kg hm 2 is the simulated yield for the ith fitted equation the second step is to compute the trend yield which is the mean value of yi t for each time sequence number 9 y t 1 q j 1 q y i t where q is the yi t number for each time sequence number which is related to parameters n and k then the climatic yield of winter wheat results from subtracting the values of y t from the per unit area yield and is used to create a time series of residuals 2 3 establishment of the agricultural drought indices the primary hydrological variables included precipitation and or irrigation percolation runoff and et for the farmland ecosystem rather than precipitation and or irrigation the most direct water source is soil moisture in the root zone for crops in addition the actual et is an indicator of direct water consumption fig 3 however it should be noted that effective soil moisture esm which is the water depth of the difference between the root zone soil moisture and the wilting point represents the water content that is theoretically available and the crop water requirement cwr reflects crop et under an ideal state e g disease free well fertilized crops and optimum soil water conditions and the given climatic conditions allen et al 1998 and these two parameters represent the water supply and demand perspectives respectively the two parameters can be calculated as follows 10 e s m 1 0 3 j n u m n u m 7 θ j θ w p h 11 c w r e t 1 8 j n u m n u m 7 k s j where j is the julian day corresponding to the composite mod16a2 product j 1 9 17 361 and h is the depth of the virtual root zone for winter wheat however in the study the depth was simplified to 1 m furthermore θj m3 m 3 is the soil water content computed by eq 1 within 0 1 m on the jth day θwp is the wilting point et mm is the 8 day composite et acquired from the mod16a2 product esm mm and cwr mm are the total effective soil moisture within 0 1 m and the crop water requirement during 8 days or 5 6 days at the end of a normal year or a leap year respectively and ksj is the water stress coefficient on the jth day which can be simulated by eq 12 jensen 1973 12 k s j l n θ j θ w p θ θ w p 100 1 l n 101 θ w p θ j θ 1 θ j θ where ksj is the water stress coefficient on the jth day θj is the soil water content θwp is the wilting point and θ m3 m 3 is the critical soil water content which is generally from 70 to 80 of the field capacity in the study the value was set to 75 of the field capacity chi et al 2018 for short term datasets instead of a parametric distribution function for example the gamma distribution applied to spi the empirical probability of an event can be obtained with the nonparametric approach using the empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 with the above indicators i e esm and cwr two projections can be implemented one project is similar to the spei expressed as the difference between precipitation and the eto which uses the difference between esm water supply and cwr water demand to characterize agricultural drought 13 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where xi is the difference between esm and cwr at a certain time i is the rank number of the difference from the smallest n is the sample size and p xi is the corresponding empirical probability the other project treats the esm and cwr as two separate variables to depict agricultural drought yue et al 1999 hao and aghakouchak 2014 14 p x k y k p x i x k y i y k m k 0 44 n 0 12 where mk is the number of occurrences of the pair xi yi i e the esm and cwr for xi xk and yi yk n is the sample size and p xk yk is the joint probability of the two drought related variables then the outputs of eqs 13 and 14 can be transformed into standardized drought indices as follows 15 u s m e i φ 1 p x i 16 b s m e i φ 1 p x k y k where usmei is the univariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index bsmei is the bivariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index φ is the standardized normal distribution function and p xi and p xk yk are the probability derived from eqs 13 and 14 respectively farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 then two new agricultural drought indices with an 8 day time interval were established based on the esm and cwr 2 4 meteorological and agricultural drought indices to check the monitoring ability of the new agricultural indices i e usmei and bsmei for drought events a meteorological drought index precipitation anomaly in percentage pa and two agricultural drought indices esi and smapi were selected national standard of people s republic of china gb t20481 2017 2017 anderson et al 2011 bergman et al 1988 which have been widely used in applicability assessment of drought indices and as the indicators of crop yield anderson et al 2016 liu et al 2019 precipitation et and soil moisture as drought related indicators were considered in these drought indices the formulas were as follows 17 p a p p p 100 18 e s i e t e t o z s c o r e 19 s m a p i s m s m s m where p is monthly precipitation mm p is the multi year average precipitation mm during the same period et and eto are the actual evapotranspiration mm and the reference evapotranspiration mm with an 8 day time interval derived from the mod16 a2 product sm is the average soil moisture m3 m 3 during the 8 days corresponding to the mod16 a2 product within 0 1 m and sm is the multi year average soil moisture m3 m 3 during the same period pa reflects the deficit in precipitation on a monthly scale a meteorological drought occurs when pa is less than 40 esi represents the temporal anomaly in the ratio of et to eto and the value is standardized by the z score to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 in the smapi an agricultural drought is indicated by a soil water content anomaly when it less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 comparisons among pa esi smapi usmei and bsmei for a typical drought event according to the yearbook of meteorological disasters in china the northern winter wheat region including beijing hebei henan shandong and anhui experienced meteorological droughts with moderate to severe intensity from november 2008 to january 2009 this phenomenon could be monitored by the pa which indicated that meteorological droughts mainly occurred in northern henan and central and western shandong in october 2008 then the drought area spread over time and the whole ncp was influenced by meteorological drought in january 2009 subsequently the meteorological droughts were relieved because there was more precipitation relative to the same history period in most parts of the ncp fig 4 compared to the meteorological drought index i e the pa the agricultural drought indices i e esi smapi usmei and bsmei monitored winter wheat drought conditions at a higher time resolution i e 8 day time interval for this reason only one drought monitoring event per month e g 20081007 represented one drought monitoring event from october 7 to october 14 2008 was selected for analysis due to mechanism and time scale differences drought monitoring derived from the agricultural drought indices was different from that monitored by the pa the esi showed that nearly the whole ncp experienced the effects of drought during the specific time span in october 2008 however the agricultural drought was mitigated to some extent during the period from november to december of 2008 then the agricultural drought became severe and spread to hebei henan anhui and jiangsu during the specific time span in january 2009 subsequently the ncp was not influenced by agricultural drought except for certain areas such as the shandong peninsula and northern henan however drought monitoring with the smapi was not similar to that observed by the esi the smapi indicated that most parts of the ncp were always affected by agricultural drought during the observation periods from november 2008 to march 2009 in addition the drought states between the smapi and esi in april and may of 2009 were nearly opposite such as in southeastern hebei northwestern shandong and central and southern shandong moreover the winter wheat in anhui and shandong did not experience significant agricultural drought effects during the observation periods except in may 2009 fig 4 because optical remote sensing is limited by weather conditions e g the presence of clouds the agricultural drought information reflected by the usmei and bsmei was incomplete during certain periods e g in october 2008 and february 2009 on the ncp generally the agricultural drought status of winter wheat monitored with the usmei was extremely similar to that reflected by the smapi which was probably because the esm within 0 1 m is closely related to soil moisture and played an important role in establishing the drought index nevertheless agricultural drought monitored with the bsmei was more severe than that reflected by the usmei at any observation period during the winter wheat growing season because of the different establishment schemes of the drought indices moreover the correlation analysis also indicated that the usmei had higher consistency with the smapi compared to the bsmei and the correlations between these two agricultural drought indices i e usmei and bsmei and esi were extremely poor fig 4 3 2 comparisons of agricultural drought monitoring at the site scale on the ncp a total of 61 agrometeorological stations recorded agricultural drought events every ten days per month for winter wheat from 2001 to 2013 as the time interval of the usmei bsmei esi and smapi is 8 days it was necessary to determine whether the observation periods of these four agricultural drought indices belonged to the specific ten days each month in this study once more than half of the observation period was included within the ten day period the agricultural drought monitoring by these four agricultural drought indices was deemed appropriate for the ten day period then the intensity of agricultural drought according to the four indices for each site was extracted based on the pixel at which it was located subsequently a comparison historical drought records with the monitoring results from these four agricultural drought indices was performed to determine the applicability of each agricultural drought index under different conditions on a month basis i e historical records indicated that agricultural droughts occurred historical records indicated that there were no droughts and comprehensive assessment from 2001 to 2013 for the agro meteorological stations where winter wheat experienced agricultural droughts the bsmei could precisely indicate that droughts occurred with more than 80 accuracy during the growing season except for february the bsmei had the highest accuracy among the indices to match the stations that were influenced by agricultural droughts in all months of the winter wheat growing season and it was followed by the esi in addition the ability of the usmei and smapi to match the stations affected by agricultural droughts generally decreased over time and the latter performed worst fig 5 a for the agrometeorological stations that were not influenced by agricultural droughts based on historical records the accuracy of agricultural droughts monitored by the usmei was higher than that of the smapi from october to january however the smapi had the highest accuracy to match the stations that were not affected by agricultural droughts from march to june it should be noted that the esi could best reflect drought information for winter wheat in february at 56 49 accuracy however monitoring for non arid conditions by the bsmei had the worst accuracy which was far below its ability to match the agrometeorological stations where winter wheat experienced agricultural droughts this phenomenon indicated that the bsmei may overestimate the intensity of agricultural droughts fig 5 b considering the above two aspects synthetically the assessment indicated that the usmei could reflect agricultural drought information for winter wheat from october to january and the smapi could reflect information from march to june and esi performed best for february fig 5 c 3 3 correlations between agricultural drought indices and climatic yields at the county level and site scale the correlation analyses were performed between agricultural drought indices and climatic yields of winter wheat at the county level and site scale to further verify the monitoring performance of the usmei and bsmei for drought conditions the mean drought intensity of each agricultural drought index bsmei esi smapi and usmei during the winter wheat growing season was computed for each county and station given that there were 33 observations based on the mod16 a2 product during the winter wheat growing season from october to mid june no less than 23 monitoring values approximately 70 of the total number of observations in a certain grid must be ensured within the whole growing season and the mean drought intensity was obtained subsequently the drought intensity represented by each agricultural drought index for a county number of the grids showing drought intensity must be more than 70 of that labeled as cropland throughout a county or a site the grid in which a site was located and its 4 adjacent grids was calculated then the time series the length of the time series was no less than 5 and 6 years at the county level and site scale respectively between the climatic yield of winter wheat and the mean drought intensity of each agricultural drought index during growing season was extracted to implement the correlation analysis based on the strict selection criteria mentioned above the correlation analyses at the county level were carried out for only 14 counties compared with other 3 agricultural drought indices the worst correlation between the bsmei and climatic yield was detected and more than half the counties unexpectedly had negative correlation coefficients fig 6 however the correlation coefficients of 14 counties were all positive for the esi smapi and usmei while the distribution of correlation coefficients for the usmei was relatively dispersed the mean value of which was approximately 0 50 that was greater than that of the smapi and roughly equal to that of the esi furthermore the correlation coefficients of some counties for the usmei were higher than that of esi and even close to 0 90 fig 6 similarly only 16 agrometeorological 61 agrometeorological stations in total throughout the ncp stations had time series that met the above limitations to implement correlation analyses between agricultural droughts indices and climatic yields of winter wheat results indicated that the 4 agricultural drought indices all had negative correlation coefficients with climatic yields at some stations and such case was detected in nearly half the sites for the bsmei esi and usmei although the mean value of correlation coefficients for the smapi was relatively high 50 of which were less than 0 25 which may be explained by the occurrence of other disasters waterlogging dry hot wind hail etc during winter wheat growing season thus causing that the climatic yield is not influenced by droughts alone then only these seasons during which winter wheat grows under normal or drought condition were selected to perform the correlation analyses between climatic yields and agricultural drought indices based on the disaster records while negative correlation coefficients were still detected at certain sites for all of these 4 agricultural drought indices over 75 of the sites had positive correlation coefficients for the esi smapi and usmei fig 7 the scale effect that leads to inconsistency between the climatic yield at a site and the drought intensity derived from 0 1 0 1 grid is difficult to eliminate overall the bsmei still showed a poor relationship with the climatic yield of winter wheat the usmei had higher mean values of correlation coefficients than that of the smapi and presented more concentrated distributions for the correlation coefficients than the esi fig 2 4 discussion agricultural drought is a complex phenomenon that is related to weather systems crop types soil characteristics etc zhang et al 2016 huang et al 2018 to monitor agricultural drought a series of drought indicators such as hydrological variables meteorological elements and even spectral characteristics of vegetation can be employed to establish the relevant agricultural drought indices rhee et al 2010 farahmand et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 sun et al 2017 soil moisture and et as the two most important hydrological variables are closely related to crop growth based on these two factors two agricultural drought indices i e the usmei with explicit physical meanings of water demand and supply and the bsmei were built to monitor agricultural droughts for winter wheat on the ncp the overall assessment showed that the usmei could effectively reflect the drought information for winter wheat from october to january which may contribute to drought mitigation in fall and winter throughout the ncp however drought monitoring for winter wheat in february was better implemented by the esi and good performance from march to june was observed for the smapi the et data originating from the mod16a2 product is the important component to build the usmei and esi however it is difficult to accurately determine the surface resistance which is crucial to estimate evaporation from land surface and transpiration from the plant canopy within the mod16a2 algorithm logic yang et al 2015 different canopy cover types likely have significant effect on the estimation of surface resistance before and after february and affect the quality of the et product from march to may during winter wheat growing season this reason likely explains why the smapi performed better than the usmei and esi after february and indicates that only one drought index does not completely monitor agricultural drought conditions aghakouchak et al 2015 verifying the performance of the usmei with diverse et and soil moisture products derived from different algorithms is also a vital process that should be implemented in the future using crop yield to evaluate the applicability of drought indices is a practical approach for drought research rhee et al 2010 anderson et al 2016 wang et al 2016 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 generally the crop yield per unit area yield can be decomposed to obtain the climatic yield and these data can be used in correlation analyses with drought indices in this study the correlation analyses showed that the bsmei presented a poor relationship with climatic yield and the mean value of the correlation coefficients for the usmei was higher than that of smapi which was roughly equal to that of the esi whether at the county level or on the site scale however negative correlation coefficients were still detected at some stations for all 4 agricultural drought indices when climatic yields were protected from other disasters flooding dry hot wind hail etc fig 7 a major cause of this finding is that the scale effect drought intensity from 0 1 0 1 grid and climatic yield on the site scale has an impact on the final correlation analysis and is impossible to be eliminated however it should be noted that the overall correlation between climatic yield and each agricultural drought index has been improved to some extent on the site scale after extracting the winter wheat growing seasons influenced by droughts alone fig 8 moreover the short time series of winter wheat yield used in this study and the selection of different detrending methods e g linear regression model moving average model second order polynomial regression model etc of crop yield may have also introduced uncertainty into the correlation analysis lu et al 2017 in addition due to the deficiency susceptible to weather conditions of the optical remote sensing product i e mod16a2 data were missing for agricultural drought monitoring by the usmei such as the observations in february 2009 fig 4 moreover the soil moisture in the root zone not the soil moisture within 0 1 m represents the true soil water condition for crop development and is dynamic and variable as the root grows therefore long term observation data about et soil moisture and crop yield is necessary to further analyze the applicability of the usmei in addition data assimilation technology combining optical remote sensing with crop models can acquire the important parameters in long time series with high time resolution and can be applied to drought monitoring on the regional scale 5 conclusions based on the soil moisture and et products originating from ecmwf and modis respectively two agricultural drought indices usmei and bsmei were developed to monitor agricultural droughts for winter wheat on the ncp compared with the esi and smapi the usmei could better reflect agricultural drought information for winter wheat from october to january however the esi performed well in february and the smapi performed well from march to june it should be noted that the bsmei overestimated the intensity of agricultural drought based on an assessment of historical disaster records on the site scale overall the usmei presented a closer relationship with the climatic yield of winter wheat compared with the smapi and showed a similar performance with the esi for the correlation between drought intensity and climatic yield at the county level and the site scale however due to the scale effect and short time series for the winter wheat yield the correlation between the climatic yield of winter wheat and the drought intensity derived from these agricultural drought indices on the site scale was not as good as that calculated at the county level declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

respectively two agricultural drought indices i e the univariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index usmei and bivariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index bsmei were developed to reflect water stress for winter wheat our case study on the north china plain ncp indicated that the usmei could effectively monitor agricultural drought especially in autumn and winter from october to january furthermore compared with the evaporative stress index esi and soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi the correlations between the usmei and climatic yields were acceptable at the county level or site scale however for the rest of the winter wheat growing season the esi and smapi performed better than the usmei in addition the bsmei was not suitable for monitoring droughts for winter wheat because this index overestimated the drought intensity keywords soil moisture evapotranspiration univariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index agricultural drought winter wheat 1 introduction drought is one of the most devastating and far reaching disasters and has serious impacts on agricultural production economic development and human livelihoods svoboda et al 2002 shah and paulsen 2003 hao et al 2018 in recent years countries worldwide have experienced extensive property damage resulting from extremely severe drought events the 2018 drought throughout northwestern europe resulted in up to 900 million in losses for danish farmers alone world bank 2019 prolonged droughts from 2011 to 2016 resulted in more than 5 5 billion in economic losses to the agricultural sector in california medellín azuara et al 2016 in china 1 02 107 ha of drought area was caused by winter and spring drought over the northern wheat region in 2009 feng 2010 as one of the most typical regions subjected to drought in the world wmo 2012 the north china plain ncp has attracted increasing attention from geologists ecologists and meteorologists in terms of water resources cropping systems and drought monitoring shi et al 2011 yang et al 2017 sun et al 2017 gong et al 2018 wu et al 2019 shi et al 2011 emphasized that there is no further mining potential due to groundwater overexploitation in the ncp at present in addition the ncp has experienced significantly more droughts since the 1960s and more meteorological droughts will occur in the future based on entropy aided evaluation piao et al 2010 sang et al 2018 furthermore the drought pattern on the ncp is dominated by winter and spring droughts which affect the critical stage of winter wheat liu et al 2018 consequently the timely and effective monitoring of agricultural droughts on winter wheat production on the ncp is crucial for water resource management drought mitigation and even national food security from the perspective of the hydrological cycle droughts are generally classified into four categories meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought wilhite 2005 among these meteorological drought is triggered by a deficit in precipitation aghakouchak et al 2015 however agricultural drought caused by the stress of soil moisture in the root zone results in chlorophyll content losses vegetation wilting and even crop failure over time zhou et al 2017 joiner et al 2018 the onset of which may lag that of the meteorological drought depending on the previous effective soil water content heim 2002 to monitor different kinds of droughts severity or magnitude over 70 drought indices and several drought information systems have been developed rhee et al 2010 zhang and jia 2013 aghakouchak et al 2015 martínez fernández et al 2016 wmo and gwp 2016 zhang et al 2017 sun et al 2017 hao et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the well known drought indices include the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 soil moisture deficit index smdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and evaporative stress index esi anderson et al 2011 and the u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 which is a well known drought information system the crucial indicators to build all these drought indices and information systems include hydrological variables precipitation snow et soil moisture groundwater etc meteorological elements temperature and relative humidity and vegetation spectral characteristics and they are related to a series of univariate spi smdi etc bivariate spei esi etc multivariate or composite scaled drought condition index sdci integrated remote sensing drought monitoring index irsdi etc drought indices rhee et al 2010 farahmand et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 sun et al 2017 based on a review of previous studies two aspects need to be considered firstly agricultural drought is the result of meteorological drought in agriculture areas one of the best statistical indicators of meteorological drought is precipitation however the drought indices that include this indicator such as spi or spei may not be suitable for monitoring agriculture drought especially in irrigated areas the main reason is that irrigation leads to overestimations of drought severity by certain drought indices e g spi and spei anderson et al 2011 researchers reported that the spi in august and palmer z index in july have a close relationship with corn yield anomalies in the u s east of the 100 w meridian where irrigation is not extensively used lu et al 2017 secondly agricultural drought is affected by meteorological factors soil properties vegetation types and other factors e g field management and disease sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 hence univariate drought indices cannot accurately represent agricultural drought conditions soil moisture in the root zone and et are the most direct sources of water and water loss for crops respectively as a fundamental component of the water cycle soil moisture regulates the variation and magnitude in water and energy fluxes within the soil vegetation atmosphere system and has been widely used to monitor water deficits during agricultural droughts zhang and jia 2013 hao and aghakouchak 2014 sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2018 in addition et represents mass and energy exchange between vegetation and the atmosphere and it responds faster to water stress stomatal sensitivity than the vegetation indices aghakouchak et al 2015 joiner et al 2018 in most cases using linear weighing or nonparametric distribution function to integrate drought indicators or indices is a common approach to establishing new drought indices zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2018 however these two factors are rarely considered simultaneously to depict the drought phenomenon physically when constructing agricultural drought indices consequently it is necessary to develop a new agricultural drought index with explicit physical meaning to overcome the above mentioned issues in our study the first step was to build a bivariate drought model based on water demand crop water demand and supply effective soil moisture using actual et and soil moisture products originating from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data and european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf respectively the second step was to compare the new agricultural drought indices with the esi and the soil moisture anomaly percentage index smapi bergman et al 1988 to verify the monitoring ability for typical drought events on the ncp finally the applicability of the new agricultural drought index was assessed by using the observed disaster dataset and yield dataset of winter wheat at the county level and site scale the results are expected to strengthen agricultural drought monitoring for winter wheat on the ncp 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the ncp encompasses most parts of 5 provinces hebei henan shandong jiangsu and anhui and 2 mega cities beijing and tianjin approximately 87 of the land is crop land statistic from the mcd12 q1 product of modis and the area ranges from 32 08 n to 40 23 n latitude and 112 51 e to 122 42 e longitude fig 1 winter wheat is one of the main crops grown on the ncp and provides approximately 50 of the national gross wheat yield fig 1 statistics from the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china during 2000 2011 in general winter wheat is sown in early october of the previous year and harvested in early or mid june of the following year dominated by the temperate monsoon climate the ncp has a mean annual temperature of 12 8 14 9 c and a mean annual precipitation of 472 7 882 9 mm with approximately 30 occurring from october to june i e the growing season of winter wheat wu et al 2019 on the ncp drought is one of the major natural hazards since the beginning of the 21st century the total drought area of the agriculture sector has decreased significantly due to disaster management and mitigation improvements however an area greater than 2 106 hm2 has been affected by drought in 3 main provinces hebei shandong and henan on the ncp statistic from the national bureau of statistics fig 2 2 2 data sources and processing 2 2 1 soil moisture and soil database the soil moisture data from 2001 to 2008 provided by the integrated forecasting system ifs of the ecmwf https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets set i was the hres high resolution direct model output

and 1 2 89 m in this study 3 layers of soil moisture within 1 m were used and separately averaged to daily values for each layer then the volumetric soil moisture within 1 m was computed as follows 1 θ l 1 3 θ i h l where l l 1 2 and 3 is the number of soil layers for the soil moisture product θ m3 m 3 is the daily volumetric soil moisture within 0 1 m θi m3 m 3 is the daily volumetric soil

compared to the soil moisture product the soil database had a more precise soil layer distribution to acquire the corresponding soil parameters i e sand clay and soil organic matter fractions at a

capture the relevant soil information the formula was as follows 2 m l 1 6 h l ρ b l m l l 1 6 h l ρ b l where l l 1 2 3 6 is the soil layer number in the soil database hl and ρbl are the depth of the soil layer m and bulk density g cm 3 in the soil database respectively ml g 100 g 1 is the fraction of sand s g 100 g 1 clay c g 100 g 1 and soil organic matter om g 100 g 1 corresponding to the soil

the field capacity and wilting point in all layers were simulated as follows saxton et al 2006 3 θ f c 1 283 θ f c t 2 0 626 θ f c t 0 015 4 θ w p 1 14 θ w p t 0 12 5 θ f c t 0 251 s 0 195 c 0 011 o m

respectively and θfct m3 m 3 and θwpt m3 m 3 are intermediate variables in the simulation of θfc and θwp respectively it should be noted that because of simulation error in the above mentioned models these two simulated values needed to be replaced with the weighted mean values the weight was the ratio between the depth of a specific layer and 0 829 m of the field capacity and wilting point in 6 layers in the soil database when the absolute deviation between the simulated value and the weighted mean value was more than 20 2 2 2 modis data the modis data used in the study included the level 3 product mcd12q1 and the level 4 product mod16a2 https modis gsfc nasa gov data to cover the study area completely imagery from tracks h26v04 h26v05 h27v04 and h27v05 need to be acquired the mcd12q1 product provides global land cover types with a pixel size of 500 m at yearly intervals from 2001 to 2017 derived from 6 different classification schemes among these the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp as the primary land cover scheme identifies 17 classes including 11 natural vegetation classes 3 human altered classes and 3 non vegetated classes in which the classification

eto with a pixel size of 500 m at 8 day intervals from 2001 to 2018 the pixel values for the two variables were the sum of all 8 days within the composite period note that the last 8 day period of each year was a 5 or 6 day composite period depending on whether it was a leap year or a normal year running et al 2017 because the original coordinate systems for two products were sinusoidal the hdf eos to geotiff conversion tool heg http hdfeos org software heg php was used for mosaicking resampling nearest neighbor and reprojection transform to the geographic coordinate system to obtain new imagery with a spatial resolution of 0 1 matching the soil moisture product for a specific period then the intersection of croplands was obtained among 17 imageries from 2001 to 2017 with matlab r2014a fig 1 note that the cropland extracted via mcd12q1 was considered the planted area of winter wheat because this grain is one of the primary crops in the winter wheat summer maize rotation system on the ncp in addition the real values of et and eto were the pixel values multiplied by a scale factor 0 1 based on the imageries processed by the heg 2 2 3 precipitation historical observed precipitation data were collected by the national meteorological information centre of the china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjgx from 1965 to 2018 and the daily data were acquired from 373 meteorological stations due to missing data and site migration the meteorological stations could be used only after the following criteria were adopted in sequence 1 no missing data within an entire month 2 migration distance of the station is no more than 10 km away from the original position and 3 percentage of missing data is smaller than 1 those gaps were replaced with values on the same day from the nearest meteorological station wu et al 2019 in total 278 meteorological stations had complete time series data which were used for further drought analyses 226 meteorological stations were evenly distributed within the ncp and the remaining sites encompassed the study area fig 1 2 2 4 disaster records and winter wheat yield regional drought information derived from the yearbook of meteorological disasters in china from 2005 to 2017 depicted the start time end time extent of drought and associated losses from the perspective of meteorological drought moreover 61 agrometeorological stations fig 1 described in detail the start time end time and severity of drought every ten days for winter wheat from 2001 to 2013 on the ncp the winter wheat yield data per unit area yield included county level 265 counties from 2002 to 2011 and site scale 61 agrometeorological stations from 2002 to 2013 fig 1 yield records on the ncp crop yield is controlled by many aspects including scientific and technological improvements e g advances in breeding fertilizer pesticides and irrigation infrastructure and weather and climatic factors lu et al 2017 drought is still a primary factor that limits agricultural productivity and causes crop yield uncertainty martínez fernández et al 2016 to acquire the yield component determined by weather and climatic variability including the adverse effect of disasters detrending must be applied to remove yield trends due to scientific and technological advances for winter wheat yields per unit area yield zhang et al 2017 lu et al 2017 generally the simplest detrending method is an additive decomposition model that is defined by the following equation dong et al 2015 7 y y c y t where y per unit area yield kg hm 2 is the winter wheat yield recorded at the county level or site scale yc kg hm 2 is the climatic yield reflecting the crop yield component affected by fluctuations in climatic elements y t kg hm 2 is the trend yield reflecting yield variability induced by scientific and technological advances and t is the time sequence number to extract the climatic yield of winter wheat from the original data the trend yield was simulated with the mean linear sliding method the first step was to determine the linear regression equation in a specific moving window the formula can be written as follows 8 y i t a i b i t i 1 2 3 n k 1 where n is the sample size k is the moving step and set to 5 in the study i is the number of fitted equations t is the time sequence number and changes with i i e when i 1 t 1 2 3 k when i 2 t 2 3 4 k 1 when i n k 1 t n k 1 n k 2 n k 3 n and yi t kg hm 2 is the simulated yield for the ith fitted equation the second step is to compute the trend yield which is the mean value of yi t for each time sequence number 9 y t 1 q j 1 q y i t where q is the yi t number for each time sequence number which is related to parameters n and k then the climatic yield of winter wheat results from subtracting the values of y t from the per unit area yield and is used to create a time series of residuals 2 3 establishment of the agricultural drought indices the primary hydrological variables included precipitation and or irrigation percolation runoff and et for the farmland ecosystem rather than precipitation and or irrigation the most direct water source is soil moisture in the root zone for crops in addition the actual et is an indicator of direct water consumption fig 3 however it should be noted that effective soil moisture esm which is the water depth of the difference between the root zone soil moisture and the wilting point represents the water content that is theoretically available and the crop water requirement cwr reflects crop et under an ideal state e g disease free well fertilized crops and optimum soil water conditions and the given climatic conditions allen et al 1998 and these two parameters represent the water supply and demand perspectives respectively the two parameters can be calculated as follows 10 e s m 1 0 3 j n u m n u m 7 θ j θ w p h 11 c w r e t 1 8 j n u m n u m 7 k s j where j is the julian day corresponding to the composite mod16a2 product j 1 9 17 361 and h is the depth of the virtual root zone for winter wheat however in the study the depth was simplified to 1 m furthermore θj m3 m 3 is the soil water content computed by eq 1 within 0 1 m on the jth day θwp is the wilting point et mm is the 8 day composite et acquired from the mod16a2 product esm mm and cwr mm are the total effective soil moisture within 0 1 m and the crop water requirement during 8 days or 5 6 days at the end of a normal year or a leap year respectively and ksj is the water stress coefficient on the jth day which can be simulated by eq 12 jensen 1973 12 k s j l n θ j θ w p θ θ w p 100 1 l n 101 θ w p θ j θ 1 θ j θ where ksj is the water stress coefficient on the jth day θj is the soil water content θwp is the wilting point and θ m3 m 3 is the critical soil water content which is generally from 70 to 80 of the field capacity in the study the value was set to 75 of the field capacity chi et al 2018 for short term datasets instead of a parametric distribution function for example the gamma distribution applied to spi the empirical probability of an event can be obtained with the nonparametric approach using the empirical gringorten plotting position gringorten 1963 with the above indicators i e esm and cwr two projections can be implemented one project is similar to the spei expressed as the difference between precipitation and the eto which uses the difference between esm water supply and cwr water demand to characterize agricultural drought 13 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where xi is the difference between esm and cwr at a certain time i is the rank number of the difference from the smallest n is the sample size and p xi is the corresponding empirical probability the other project treats the esm and cwr as two separate variables to depict agricultural drought yue et al 1999 hao and aghakouchak 2014 14 p x k y k p x i x k y i y k m k 0 44 n 0 12 where mk is the number of occurrences of the pair xi yi i e the esm and cwr for xi xk and yi yk n is the sample size and p xk yk is the joint probability of the two drought related variables then the outputs of eqs 13 and 14 can be transformed into standardized drought indices as follows 15 u s m e i φ 1 p x i 16 b s m e i φ 1 p x k y k where usmei is the univariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index bsmei is the bivariate soil moisture and evapotranspiration index φ is the standardized normal distribution function and p xi and p xk yk are the probability derived from eqs 13 and 14 respectively farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 then two new agricultural drought indices with an 8 day time interval were established based on the esm and cwr 2 4 meteorological and agricultural drought indices to check the monitoring ability of the new agricultural indices i e usmei and bsmei for drought events a meteorological drought index precipitation anomaly in percentage pa and two agricultural drought indices esi and smapi were selected national standard of people s republic of china gb t20481 2017 2017 anderson et al 2011 bergman et al 1988 which have been widely used in applicability assessment of drought indices and as the indicators of crop yield anderson et al 2016 liu et al 2019 precipitation et and soil moisture as drought related indicators were considered in these drought indices the formulas were as follows 17 p a p p p 100 18 e s i e t e t o z s c o r e 19 s m a p i s m s m s m where p is monthly precipitation mm p is the multi year average precipitation mm during the same period et and eto are the actual evapotranspiration mm and the reference evapotranspiration mm with an 8 day time interval derived from the mod16 a2 product sm is the average soil moisture m3 m 3 during the 8 days corresponding to the mod16 a2 product within 0 1 m and sm is the multi year average soil moisture m3 m 3 during the same period pa reflects the deficit in precipitation on a monthly scale a meteorological drought occurs when pa is less than 40 esi represents the temporal anomaly in the ratio of et to eto and the value is standardized by the z score to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 in the smapi an agricultural drought is indicated by a soil water content anomaly when it less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 comparisons among pa esi smapi usmei and bsmei for a typical drought event according to the yearbook of meteorological disasters in china the northern winter wheat region including beijing hebei henan shandong and anhui experienced meteorological droughts with moderate to severe intensity from november 2008 to january 2009 this phenomenon could be monitored by the pa which indicated that meteorological droughts mainly occurred in northern henan and central and western shandong in october 2008 then the drought area spread over time and the whole ncp was influenced by meteorological drought in january 2009 subsequently the meteorological droughts were relieved because there was more precipitation relative to the same history period in most parts of the ncp fig 4 compared to the meteorological drought index i e the pa the agricultural drought indices i e esi smapi usmei and bsmei monitored winter wheat drought conditions at a higher time resolution i e 8 day time interval for this reason only one drought monitoring event per month e g 20081007 represented one drought monitoring event from october 7 to october 14 2008 was selected for analysis due to mechanism and time scale differences drought monitoring derived from the agricultural drought indices was different from that monitored by the pa the esi showed that nearly the whole ncp experienced the effects of drought during the specific time span in october 2008 however the agricultural drought was mitigated to some extent during the period from november to december of 2008 then the agricultural drought became severe and spread to hebei henan anhui and jiangsu during the specific time span in january 2009 subsequently the ncp was not influenced by agricultural drought except for certain areas such as the shandong peninsula and northern henan however drought monitoring with the smapi was not similar to that observed by the esi the smapi indicated that most parts of the ncp were always affected by agricultural drought during the observation periods from november 2008 to march 2009 in addition the drought states between the smapi and esi in april and may of 2009 were nearly opposite such as in southeastern hebei northwestern shandong and central and southern shandong moreover the winter wheat in anhui and shandong did not experience significant agricultural drought effects during the observation periods except in may 2009 fig 4 because optical remote sensing is limited by weather conditions e g the presence of clouds the agricultural drought information reflected by the usmei and bsmei was incomplete during certain periods e g in october 2008 and february 2009 on the ncp generally the agricultural drought status of winter wheat monitored with the usmei was extremely similar to that reflected by the smapi which was probably because the esm within 0 1 m is closely related to soil moisture and played an important role in establishing the drought index nevertheless agricultural drought monitored with the bsmei was more severe than that reflected by the usmei at any observation period during the winter wheat growing season because of the different establishment schemes of the drought indices moreover the correlation analysis also indicated that the usmei had higher consistency with the smapi compared to the bsmei and the correlations between these two agricultural drought indices i e usmei and bsmei and esi were extremely poor fig 4 3 2 comparisons of agricultural drought monitoring at the site scale on the ncp a total of 61 agrometeorological stations recorded agricultural drought events every ten days per month for winter wheat from 2001 to 2013 as the time interval of the usmei bsmei esi and smapi is 8 days it was necessary to determine whether the observation periods of these four agricultural drought indices belonged to the specific ten days each month in this study once more than half of the observation period was included within the ten day period the agricultural drought monitoring by these four agricultural drought indices was deemed appropriate for the ten day period then the intensity of agricultural drought according to the four indices for each site was extracted based on the pixel at which it was located subsequently a comparison historical drought records with the monitoring results from these four agricultural drought indices was performed to determine the applicability of each agricultural drought index under different conditions on a month basis i e historical records indicated that agricultural droughts occurred historical records indicated that there were no droughts and comprehensive assessment from 2001 to 2013 for the agro meteorological stations where winter wheat experienced agricultural droughts the bsmei could precisely indicate that droughts occurred with more than 80 accuracy during the growing season except for february the bsmei had the highest accuracy among the indices to match the stations that were influenced by agricultural droughts in all months of the winter wheat growing season and it was followed by the esi in addition the ability of the usmei and smapi to match the stations affected by agricultural droughts generally decreased over time and the latter performed worst fig 5 a for the agrometeorological stations that were not influenced by agricultural droughts based on historical records the accuracy of agricultural droughts monitored by the usmei was higher than that of the smapi from october to january however the smapi had the highest accuracy to match the stations that were not affected by agricultural droughts from march to june it should be noted that the esi could best reflect drought information for winter wheat in february at 56 49 accuracy however monitoring for non arid conditions by the bsmei had the worst accuracy which was far below its ability to match the agrometeorological stations where winter wheat experienced agricultural droughts this phenomenon indicated that the bsmei may overestimate the intensity of agricultural droughts fig 5 b considering the above two aspects synthetically the assessment indicated that the usmei could reflect agricultural drought information for winter wheat from october to january and the smapi could reflect information from march to june and esi performed best for february fig 5 c 3 3 correlations between agricultural drought indices and climatic yields at the county level and site scale the correlation analyses were performed between agricultural drought indices and climatic yields of winter wheat at the county level and site scale to further verify the monitoring performance of the usmei and bsmei for drought conditions the mean drought intensity of each agricultural drought index bsmei esi smapi and usmei during the winter wheat growing season was computed for each county and station given that there were 33 observations based on the mod16 a2 product during the winter wheat growing season from october to mid june no less than 23 monitoring values approximately 70 of the total number of observations in a certain grid must be ensured within the whole growing season and the mean drought intensity was obtained subsequently the drought intensity represented by each agricultural drought index for a county number of the grids showing drought intensity must be more than 70 of that labeled as cropland throughout a county or a site the grid in which a site was located and its 4 adjacent grids was calculated then the time series the length of the time series was no less than 5 and 6 years at the county level and site scale respectively between the climatic yield of winter wheat and the mean drought intensity of each agricultural drought index during growing season was extracted to implement the correlation analysis based on the strict selection criteria mentioned above the correlation analyses at the county level were carried out for only 14 counties compared with other 3 agricultural drought indices the worst correlation between the bsmei and climatic yield was detected and more than half the counties unexpectedly had negative correlation coefficients fig 6 however the correlation coefficients of 14 counties were all positive for the esi smapi and usmei while the distribution of correlation coefficients for the usmei was relatively dispersed the mean value of which was approximately 0 50 that was greater than that of the smapi and roughly equal to that of the esi furthermore the correlation coefficients of some counties for the usmei were higher than that of esi and even close to 0 90 fig 6 similarly only 16 agrometeorological 61 agrometeorological stations in total throughout the ncp stations had time series that met the above limitations to implement correlation analyses between agricultural droughts indices and climatic yields of winter wheat results indicated that the 4 agricultural drought indices all had negative correlation coefficients with climatic yields at some stations and such case was detected in nearly half the sites for the bsmei esi and usmei although the mean value of correlation coefficients for the smapi was relatively high 50 of which were less than 0 25 which may be explained by the occurrence of other disasters waterlogging dry hot wind hail etc during winter wheat growing season thus causing that the climatic yield is not influenced by droughts alone then only these seasons during which winter wheat grows under normal or drought condition were selected to perform the correlation analyses between climatic yields and agricultural drought indices based on the disaster records while negative correlation coefficients were still detected at certain sites for all of these 4 agricultural drought indices over 75 of the sites had positive correlation coefficients for the esi smapi and usmei fig 7 the scale effect that leads to inconsistency between the climatic yield at a site and the drought intensity derived from 0 1 0 1 grid is difficult to eliminate overall the bsmei still showed a poor relationship with the climatic yield of winter wheat the usmei had higher mean values of correlation coefficients than that of the smapi and presented more concentrated distributions for the correlation coefficients than the esi fig 2 4 discussion agricultural drought is a complex phenomenon that is related to weather systems crop types soil characteristics etc zhang et al 2016 huang et al 2018 to monitor agricultural drought a series of drought indicators such as hydrological variables meteorological elements and even spectral characteristics of vegetation can be employed to establish the relevant agricultural drought indices rhee et al 2010 farahmand et al 2015 aghakouchak et al 2015 sun et al 2017 soil moisture and et as the two most important hydrological variables are closely related to crop growth based on these two factors two agricultural drought indices i e the usmei with explicit physical meanings of water demand and supply and the bsmei were built to monitor agricultural droughts for winter wheat on the ncp the overall assessment showed that the usmei could effectively reflect the drought information for winter wheat from october to january which may contribute to drought mitigation in fall and winter throughout the ncp however drought monitoring for winter wheat in february was better implemented by the esi and good performance from march to june was observed for the smapi the et data originating from the mod16a2 product is the important component to build the usmei and esi however it is difficult to accurately determine the surface resistance which is crucial to estimate evaporation from land surface and transpiration from the plant canopy within the mod16a2 algorithm logic yang et al 2015 different canopy cover types likely have significant effect on the estimation of surface resistance before and after february and affect the quality of the et product from march to may during winter wheat growing season this reason likely explains why the smapi performed better than the usmei and esi after february and indicates that only one drought index does not completely monitor agricultural drought conditions aghakouchak et al 2015 verifying the performance of the usmei with diverse et and soil moisture products derived from different algorithms is also a vital process that should be implemented in the future using crop yield to evaluate the applicability of drought indices is a practical approach for drought research rhee et al 2010 anderson et al 2016 wang et al 2016 lu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 generally the crop yield per unit area yield can be decomposed to obtain the climatic yield and these data can be used in correlation analyses with drought indices in this study the correlation analyses showed that the bsmei presented a poor relationship with climatic yield and the mean value of the correlation coefficients for the usmei was higher than that of smapi which was roughly equal to that of the esi whether at the county level or on the site scale however negative correlation coefficients were still detected at some stations for all 4 agricultural drought indices when climatic yields were protected from other disasters flooding dry hot wind hail etc fig 7 a major cause of this finding is that the scale effect drought intensity from 0 1 0 1 grid and climatic yield on the site scale has an impact on the final correlation analysis and is impossible to be eliminated however it should be noted that the overall correlation between climatic yield and each agricultural drought index has been improved to some extent on the site scale after extracting the winter wheat growing seasons influenced by droughts alone fig 8 moreover the short time series of winter wheat yield used in this study and the selection of different detrending methods e g linear regression model moving average model second order polynomial regression model etc of crop yield may have also introduced uncertainty into the correlation analysis lu et al 2017 in addition due to the deficiency susceptible to weather conditions of the optical remote sensing product i e mod16a2 data were missing for agricultural drought monitoring by the usmei such as the observations in february 2009 fig 4 moreover the soil moisture in the root zone not the soil moisture within 0 1 m represents the true soil water condition for crop development and is dynamic and variable as the root grows therefore long term observation data about et soil moisture and crop yield is necessary to further analyze the applicability of the usmei in addition data assimilation technology combining optical remote sensing with crop models can acquire the important parameters in long time series with high time resolution and can be applied to drought monitoring on the regional scale 5 conclusions based on the soil moisture and et products originating from ecmwf and modis respectively two agricultural drought indices usmei and bsmei were developed to monitor agricultural droughts for winter wheat on the ncp compared with the esi and smapi the usmei could better reflect agricultural drought information for winter wheat from october to january however the esi performed well in february and the smapi performed well from march to june it should be noted that the bsmei overestimated the intensity of agricultural drought based on an assessment of historical disaster records on the site scale overall the usmei presented a closer relationship with the climatic yield of winter wheat compared with the smapi and showed a similar performance with the esi for the correlation between drought intensity and climatic yield at the county level and the site scale however due to the scale effect and short time series for the winter wheat yield the correlation between the climatic yield of winter wheat and the drought intensity derived from these agricultural drought indices on the site scale was not as good as that calculated at the county level declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
