solids tss total and reducing sugars and anthocyanin content meanwhile the percentage of vegetative spurs fruit weight volume length diameter leaf chlorophyll content and leaf mineral content n p k ca and mg were higher in the control treatment in both seasons thus irrigation determent during autumn for 45 d from october 1st to november 14th t3 was the most conclusion efficient treatment for anna apple productivity and the non critical periods for apple agricultural practices keywords apple fruit characteristics irrigation determent malus domestica yield 1 introduction the common deciduous apple tree malus domestica borkh is one of the most widely cultivated fruit crops globally in 2018 there were 5 million ha of apple orchards that produced 86 142 197 tons of apples faostat 2020 the anna apple cultivar which is a red hadassiya golden delicious cross was developed in israel in 1967 and it is currently the leading apple cultivar in egypt agricultural practices such as irrigation management practices are considered the primary determinant of fruiting success fruit set fruit drop yield and fruit quality in fruit trees which often vary as they are affected by irrigation strategies as irrigation is essential to ensure optimal yield it is imperative to develop sound and efficient irrigation methods for sustainable fruit tree production to benefit agricultural production and the civil and industrial economy zanotelli et al 2019 agro systems are increasingly looking to more efficient technological innovation and irrigation management approaches which involve irrigation determent during the dormancy of trees for a positive effect on yield fruit quality and health related chemical compounds galindo et al 2018 regulated deficit irrigation rdi is one of three primary deficit irrigation strategies based on the physiological aspects of the response of plants to water deficit galindo et al 2018 however there is limited information on the effect of irrigation treatments during specific periods on physiological processes marsal et al 2008 regulated deficit irrigation is a promising irrigation strategy to achieve higher fruit yield and prevent excessive vegetative growth in fruit trees potentially enhancing fruit quality at harvest blanco et al 2019 2020 the tree s carbohydrate reserve pool before winter dormancy depends on the timing of leaf senescence in autumn subsequently determining the availability of these resources to support bloom and the fruit set in the subsequent year sparks 1978 additionally carbohydrate reserves act as a link between successive growing seasons influencing the processes related to cropping lopez et al 2007 shortened levels of water determent and pre winter irrigation positively affect peach productivity in the season following postharvest water stress johnson et al 1992 larson et al 1988 under water irrigation determent conditions trees develop adaptive mechanisms such as foliar abscission and deep root systems oliveira et al 2018 in addition to physiological and biochemical changes the leaves of plants under irrigation determent also undergo morphological changes locatelli et al 2019 water deficits during particular periods can be beneficial by minimizing negative impacts on yield and crop revenue and even improve harvest quality mccarthy et al 2002 the effects of water deficit depend on the timing duration and magnitude of the water deficit so the plant water status during non critical periods needs to be maintained within certain levels of water deficit kang and zhang 2004 the duration and timing of irrigation determent vary depending on the climatic conditions of each location meaning that the timing and duration of water deficit may change during any of the phenological stages of trees williams et al 1985 therefore it is necessary to adopt specialized and efficient methods of irrigation to achieve higher productivity and optimum water use gercek et al 2009 to date there is limited information on the effects of irrigation determent on the nutritional status and physical and chemical attributes of many horticulture trees including apple trees the duration and timing of irrigation determent vary depending on water availability irrigation strategies and climatic conditions to optimize agricultural production blanco et al 2020 in arid and semi arid regions irrigation determent also depends on the frequency and quantity of precipitation in the rainy season jaimez et al 2000 early severe defoliation during winter resulting from irrigation determent during autumn may affect the nutritional status and productivity of anna apple trees in the following year leading to higher productivity and optimal water use gercek et al 2009 flowering and fruit set development are the most critical phenological phases of apple tree development because the yield components are established during these phases cardoso 2011 additionally irrigation management affects flowering and growth in fruit trees de oliveira et al 2017 therefore autumn irrigation determent in anna apple trees can increase the flowering density productivity yield and fruit quality during subsequent seasons irrigation deficit periods are selected to align with growth processes that are less sensitive to water stress when the derived effects of water stress will be beneficial to the plant yield during autumn the timing and period of irrigation determent plays an important role in the productivity of anna apple trees by preventing delayed bud opening a prolonged blooming period scattered non uniform blooming and inhomogeneous crop development additionally stopping irrigation for 30 days or longer induces flowering and blooming shortly after the resumption of irrigation barbera et al 1985 this approach could also be used when the trees are in a growth phase that is less dependent on water availability girona et al 2005 regulated irrigation determent during autumn positively impacts the nutritional status and productivity of fruit trees and this strategy can be used to improve yield and fruit quality and achieve the highest return from an orchard increasing profitability however information on these dynamics under different agricultural and climatic conditions is lacking globally the motivation for this study arises from the possibility that such a simple water management strategy could have the potential to increase the anna apple yield thus this study aimed to analyze the effect of irrigation determent timing and duration on the fruit phenological development stages flowering density initial fruit set fruit yield fruit characteristics and nutritional status of anna apple trees 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and plant materials this research was

recorded as julian days in 2019 and 2020 2 2 2 flowering density and initial fruit set four uniform and healthy two inch diameter branches that were growing in different directions were examined per tree to determine flowering density under different treatments the flowering density was calculated as the average number of opened flowers for 100 spur bud inflorescences and the percentage of both vegetative and fruiting spurs after full bloom blanco et al 2020 after 20 d of petal fall the initial fruit set percentage was calculated following banyal et al 2013 using eq 1 1 initial fruit set percentage number of fruitlet s number o f f lowers 100 2 2 3 fruit yield and yield increment as the fruits reached the estimated harvest date in both seasons they were harvested and weighed to record the fruit yield kg per tree kader 2002 additionally the fruit yield increment was calculated using eq 2 and the control treatment increment was considered to equal 100 2 fruit yield increment fruit y

fruit volume cm3 and fruit dimensions length and diameter cm were measured and the fruit flesh firmness expressed as lb in2 was measured using an effigi pressure tester model ft 327 scale 3 27 lbs following magness and taylor 1982 the chemical properties of ten fruits from each replicate were measured the percentage of fruit total soluble solids tss at 20 c was determined using a handheld refractometer atago co tokyo japan and expressed as brix the titratable acidity which was expressed as the percentage of malic acid was determined following the method of the association of official analytical chemists aoac 2005 the tss acidity ratio was calculated by dividing tss by acidity the total and reducing sugars were estimated using the arsenic molybdate colorimetric method described by malik and singh 1980 and expressed as percentage fresh weight the anthocyanin content mg 100 g fresh weight was determined following the method described by rabino et al 1977 2 2 5 nutritional status the nutritional status was evaluated by determining the mineral constituents and total chlorophyll content of the leaves following abdel sattar et al 2020 samples of 30 mature fresh leaves were collected at random from the 1 year old shoots of each tree in the first week of june then they were carefully washed with tap and distilled water the leaf total chlorophyll was determined following the method described by yadava 1986 using a spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta camera ltd japan additionally samples of 40 leaves per tree were collected at random at the beginning of june from the previously tagged shoots following the method described by evenhuis and de waard 1980 to determine the mineral contents on the basis of leaf dry weight total nitrogen and phosphorus were calorimetrically determined following the methods described by evenhuis 1976 and murphy and riley 1962 potassium was measured using a flame photometer jackson 1967 and the calcium and magnesium contents were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer model 305b following jones 1977 2 3 statistical analysis all data obtained from both seasons were subjected to statistical analysis using sas statistical package 2008 for the analysis of variance the means of treatments were compared using the least significant difference lsd at a 0 05 probability level following snedecor and cochran 1990 3 results 3 1 fruit phenological development stages the effects of the different periodic irrigation determent treatments on fruit phenological development bud burst petal fall fruit set fruit diameter and harvesting date are illustrated in fig 1 the results show that the control treatment t1 was the first to reach the bud burst petal fall and fruit set stages followed by t3 and t4 in both seasons conversely the latest bud burst petal fall and fruit set dates occurred in t5 where irrigation was deterred for 45 d from october 10th to november 24th in general t3 resulted in an earlier harvesting date whereas the crop from t5 was harvested last on june 2nd and 3rd however minimal differences in harvest dates were observed between all treatments in both seasons 3 2 flowering density and fruit set the effects of periodic irrigation determent treatments on flowering density which was calculated as the average number of opened flowers for 100 spur bud inflorescences percentage vegetative and fruiting spurs and initial fruit set percentage are displayed in fig 2 in both seasons all determent treatments had a higher average number of opened flowers for 100 spur bud inflorescences percentage of fruiting spurs and initial fruit set percentage than the control treatment fig 2 however the most effective treatment was t3 which induced the highest number of opened flowers fruiting spurs and initial fruit set followed by t5 and t2 additionally in both seasons the control treatment induced significantly higher percentages of vegetative spurs than the determent treatments 3 3 fruit yield and yield increment percentage the effects of periodic irrigation determent treatments on yield and yield increment percentage are presented in fig 3 in both seasons all treatments had a higher yield than the control the treatments that induced the highest yield were t3 followed by t5 and t2 in contrast the control treatment had a significantly lower yield than other treatments in both seasons in both seasons t3 had the highest yield increment percentage followed by t5 and t2 fig 3 3 4 fruit characteristics 3 4 1 fruit physical characteristics in both seasons all treatments had a significantly lower fruit weight and volume than the control treatment table 2 a higher fruit weight and volume was observed in t4 than t2 t3 and t5 in both seasons the fruit weight and volume of fruit from t5 were significantly lower than that of the other treatments the fruit length and diameter of fruit from all treatments was less than those of the control thus the widest and longest fruits were obtained from t1 followed by t4 t2 and t5 while t3 produced the smallest fruit additionally all treatments resulted in higher fruit firmness than the control in both seasons and the increase in fruit firmness was more significant in t3 followed by t5 and t2 3 4 2 fruit chemical characteristics the effects of different irrigation determent periods on tss acidity tss acidity total sugar reducing sugars and anthocyanin contents are presented in fig 4 which shows that the percentage of tss and total and reducing sugars were significantly increased with irrigation determent t2 t4 and t5 in comparison with the control treatment for both seasons moreover t3 produced fruit with the highest tss and total and reducing sugars while t1 produced the lowest values for these parameters meanwhile in both seasons there was significantly higher fruit acidity in the control treatment than the determent treatments and fruit from t3 had the lowest percentage of fruit acidity all treatments had significantly higher anthocyanin content than the control in both seasons moreover the t3 treatment had significantly the higher anthocyanin content than the other treatments in both seasons 3 5 nutritional status the effects of different irrigation determent periods on the nutritional status in terms of leaf mineral constituents nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium and leaf total chlorophyll content are shown in table 3 in both seasons t1 trees produced leaves with significantly higher nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium contents than other treatments moreover t4 exhibited significantly higher leaf nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium contents than t2 t5 and t3 which had significantly lower leaf nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium contents than the other treatments in both seasons the control treatment had a significantly higher chlorophyll content than the other treatments while t3 had the lowest chlorophyll content 4 discussion water determent operates on the premise that transpiration is more sensitive to water deficit than photosynthesis and fruit growth during tree dormancy and it reduces excessive vegetative vigor by reducing leaf surface area through reducing leaf growth and improves yield and harvest quality in the subsequent year wilkinson and hartung 2009 additionally water determent causes severe effects on growth quantity quality and the physiological and biochemical process of plants therefore it is imperative to develop sound and efficient irrigation methods for orchards based on the optimal use of water to ensure optimal yield atkinson et al 2000 the advantages of irrigation determent include a reduction of nutrient loss from the root zone and a reduction in extreme vegetative vigor accompanied by a minor risk of crop diseases linked to high humidity ünlü et al 2006 several adaptive mechanisms such as osmotic adjustment changes in the elastic properties of cells and tissues foliar abscission stomatal regulation and a deep root system are developed under water deficit conditions oliveira et al 2018 4 1 fruit phenological development stages in general drought deciduous species have high stomatal conductance and high rates of photosynthesis and transpiration when water is available but they lose their leaves through rapid leaf shedding and enter dormancy under conditions of low water potential lambers et al 2008 the most apparent mechanism of the rapid accumulation of sugars in the leaves results immediately from the stress caused by the mobilization of carbohydrate reserves wang and stutte 1992 the changes in the carbohydrate composition that occurs in the leaves of drought stressed apple trees is caused by the induction of enzymatic pathways that break down starch and or sucrose as a result of enhanced starch to sugar conversion lambers et al 2008 reserve mobilization of stored carbohydrates is essential for shoot growth and flowering lopez et al 2007 the anna cultivar is one of the few apple cultivars that maintains productivity under hot desert conditions with irrigation importantly it has a reduced chilling requirement allowing for successful cultivation in warm winter zones the cultivar possesses several distinct physiognomies such as an early bearing fruit development period of almost 120 days and fruit ripening under extremely high day temperatures of more than 40 c miller and baker 1982 trejo gonzalez and soto valdez 1991 autumn irrigation determent had a positive effect on the phenological stages such as bud burst petal fall and fruit set dates thus these results are in agreement with martínez nicolás et al 2019 4 2 flowering density and fruit set the increase in the density of flowers on apple trees exposed to longer irrigation determent periods could be attributed to the accumulation of sugars in the phloem and xylem the increase in flower number occurs as a result of carbohydrate accumulation in the apical bud which is associated with the transition from the vegetative to flowering state in woody fruit trees mo et al 2013 additionally flowering is positively correlated with carbohydrate levels in the leaf phloem and xylem and water stress has been shown to strongly enhance flowering pingping et al 2017 flower density is influenced by increased vegetative growth which lengthens the distance between spurs and accordingly outcomes in a lower density blanco et al 2020 the relatively high fruit set percentages that we observed in the irrigation determent treatments could be attributed to early severe defoliation during the winter resulting in many flowers appearing in the following spring the rapid return and accumulation of sugars in the phloem and xylem of trees in the winter was caused by the mobilization of carbohydrate reserves which was indicated by the high fruit set percentages the determent irrigation could also affect starch and soluble carbohydrate concentrations in the roots fruit set flowering and first vegetative development primarily depend on carbohydrate reserves blanco et al 2020 thus fruit set is related to starch and soluble carbohydrate concentration although irrigation determent reduces carbon gain as a result of decreased leaf photosynthesis and partial defoliation klein et al 2001 the stress is not severe enough to directly affect flowering and fruiting when determent is temporary and irrigation is resumed before dormancy floral initiation can still be completed even though it stops during the determent period esparza et al 2001 4 3 fruit yield and yield increment percentage during water determent specific genes are induced for signal transduction in the water stress response including water channel proteins the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and nutrients and the phytohormones that are required for increasing bud growth and development zhu 2002 bray 2004 therefore water management can help improve yield the increase in productivity caused by postharvest water stress is attributed to increased flowering intensity and higher fruit set torrecilas et al 2000 larson et al 1988 found that postharvest water stress increased the productivity of peaches in the season following postharvest water stress which was probably related to a lower level of stress and pre winter irrigation the variation in yield between treatments could be due to stored carbohydrates as yield is dependent on photosynthetic carbohydrate availability lopez et al 2007 in contrast ebel et al 2001 and lopez et al 2006 reported significant reductions in crop yield in the years following water deficit stress which is a consequence of the reduction in root reserve accumulation in response to severe water stress it is possible that irrigation determent at different times during winter could affect yield by increasing the fruit set 4 4 fruit quality the use of irrigation determent at an appropriate time and for an appropriate duration can improve fruit production and fruit quality in terms of physical and chemical attributes girona et al 1997 the increase in the fruit firmness of water stressed trees could be an artifact of a decrement in fruit size as a direct impact of irrigation determent as the firmness of apples increases with decreases in fruit weight ebel et al 1993 however laribi et al 2013 found that excessive watering could have adverse effects on fruit quality nutrients contribute to the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments which increase in the leaves of the stressed trees due to higher photosynthetic activity leading to the production of more assimilates thus the accumulation of more assimilates could improve fruit chemical characteristics stino et al 2016 irrigation determent can enhance fruit quality by improving fruit taste which is associated with an increase in total soluble solids and other quality attributes such as color mpelasoka et al 2001 pérez pastor et al 2007 the determent irrigation treatments induced high tss which could explain the increase in anthocyanin synthesis additionally deficit irrigated trees typically exhibit reduced vegetative growth and the resultant exposure of fruit to sunlight can improve the red color of the fruit gelly et al 2003 intrigliolo et al 2013 4 5 nutritional status the processes of flower bud development root growth nutrient uptake reserve storage and winter acclimatization are affected by water stress kuroda et al 1985 autumnal leaf senescence is regulated by active sinks for carbohydrates and nutrients in the plant naschitz et al 2014 stino et al 2016 found a significant positive effect of increasing available soil water by decreasing the amount of water applied on the percentage of n p and k in the leaves of le conte pear leaf mineral content was affected by the timing of irrigation determent irrigation determent significantly decreased the leaf mineral content in apples by reducing the percentage of vegetative spurs produced in this context the decrease in chlorophyll content as a result of irrigation determent could be attributed to the sensitivity of photosynthetic pigments to drought stress resulting in the destruction of chlorophyll chai et al 2016 similarly šircelj et al 2005 reported a significantly lower chlorophyll index in deficit irrigated trees than control trees 5 conclusions specific irrigation determent timing and duration to improve the management of water resources is a promising technology the use of irrigation determent during autumn and the appropriate timing and period of irrigation determent have a positive impact on the nutritional status and productivity of fruit therefore this strategy can be applied to attain higher yields and fruit quality achieving the highest return from an orchard and contributing to producer profitability from the results of this study it can be concluded that irrigation determent during autumn particularly for 45 d from october 1st to november 14th t3 is an effective treatment to increase flowering fruiting spurs the productivity of anna apple trees and the non critical periods for apple agricultural practices declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

collected at random from the 1 year old shoots of each tree in the first week of june then they were carefully washed with tap and distilled water the leaf total chlorophyll was determined following the method described by yadava 1986 using a spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta camera ltd japan additionally samples of 40 leaves per tree were collected at random at the beginning of june from the previously tagged shoots following the method described by evenhuis and de waard 1980 to determine the mineral contents on the basis of leaf dry weight total nitrogen and phosphorus were calorimetrically determined following the methods described by evenhuis 1976 and murphy and riley 1962 potassium was measured using a flame photometer jackson 1967 and the calcium and magnesium contents were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer model 305b following jones 1977 2 3 statistical analysis all data obtained from both seasons were subjected to statistical analysis using sas statistical package 2008 for the analysis of variance the means of treatments were compared using the least significant difference lsd at a 0 05 probability level following snedecor and cochran 1990 3 results 3 1 fruit phenological development stages the effects of the different periodic irrigation determent treatments on fruit phenological development bud burst petal fall fruit set fruit diameter and harvesting date are illustrated in fig 1 the results show that the control treatment t1 was the first to reach the bud burst petal fall and fruit set stages followed by t3 and t4 in both seasons conversely the latest bud burst petal fall and fruit set dates occurred in t5 where irrigation was deterred for 45 d from october 10th to november 24th in general t3 resulted in an earlier harvesting date whereas the crop from t5 was harvested last on june 2nd and 3rd however minimal differences in harvest dates were observed between all treatments in both seasons 3 2 flowering density and fruit set the effects of periodic irrigation determent treatments on flowering density which was calculated as the average number of opened flowers for 100 spur bud inflorescences percentage vegetative and fruiting spurs and initial fruit set percentage are displayed in fig 2 in both seasons all determent treatments had a higher average number of opened flowers for 100 spur bud inflorescences percentage of fruiting spurs and initial fruit set percentage than the control treatment fig 2 however the most effective treatment was t3 which induced the highest number of opened flowers fruiting spurs and initial fruit set followed by t5 and t2 additionally in both seasons the control treatment induced significantly higher percentages of vegetative spurs than the determent treatments 3 3 fruit yield and yield increment percentage the effects of periodic irrigation determent treatments on yield and yield increment percentage are presented in fig 3 in both seasons all treatments had a higher yield than the control the treatments that induced the highest yield were t3 followed by t5 and t2 in contrast the control treatment had a significantly lower yield than other treatments in both seasons in both seasons t3 had the highest yield increment percentage followed by t5 and t2 fig 3 3 4 fruit characteristics 3 4 1 fruit physical characteristics in both seasons all treatments had a significantly lower fruit weight and volume than the control treatment table 2 a higher fruit weight and volume was observed in t4 than t2 t3 and t5 in both seasons the fruit weight and volume of fruit from t5 were significantly lower than that of the other treatments the fruit length and diameter of fruit from all treatments was less than those of the control thus the widest and longest fruits were obtained from t1 followed by t4 t2 and t5 while t3 produced the smallest fruit additionally all treatments resulted in higher fruit firmness than the control in both seasons and the increase in fruit firmness was more significant in t3 followed by t5 and t2 3 4 2 fruit chemical characteristics the effects of different irrigation determent periods on tss acidity tss acidity total sugar reducing sugars and anthocyanin contents are presented in fig 4 which shows that the percentage of tss and total and reducing sugars were significantly increased with irrigation determent t2 t4 and t5 in comparison with the control treatment for both seasons moreover t3 produced fruit with the highest tss and total and reducing sugars while t1 produced the lowest values for these parameters meanwhile in both seasons there was significantly higher fruit acidity in the control treatment than the determent treatments and fruit from t3 had the lowest percentage of fruit acidity all treatments had significantly higher anthocyanin content than the control in both seasons moreover the t3 treatment had significantly the higher anthocyanin content than the other treatments in both seasons 3 5 nutritional status the effects of different irrigation determent periods on the nutritional status in terms of leaf mineral constituents nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium and leaf total chlorophyll content are shown in table 3 in both seasons t1 trees produced leaves with significantly higher nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium contents than other treatments moreover t4 exhibited significantly higher leaf nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium contents than t2 t5 and t3 which had significantly lower leaf nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium contents than the other treatments in both seasons the control treatment had a significantly higher chlorophyll content than the other treatments while t3 had the lowest chlorophyll content 4 discussion water determent operates on the premise that transpiration is more sensitive to water deficit than photosynthesis and fruit growth during tree dormancy and it reduces excessive vegetative vigor by reducing leaf surface area through reducing leaf growth and improves yield and harvest quality in the subsequent year wilkinson and hartung 2009 additionally water determent causes severe effects on growth quantity quality and the physiological and biochemical process of plants therefore it is imperative to develop sound and efficient irrigation methods for orchards based on the optimal use of water to ensure optimal yield atkinson et al 2000 the advantages of irrigation determent include a reduction of nutrient loss from the root zone and a reduction in extreme vegetative vigor accompanied by a minor risk of crop diseases linked to high humidity ünlü et al 2006 several adaptive mechanisms such as osmotic adjustment changes in the elastic properties of cells and tissues foliar abscission stomatal regulation and a deep root system are developed under water deficit conditions oliveira et al 2018 4 1 fruit phenological development stages in general drought deciduous species have high stomatal conductance and high rates of photosynthesis and transpiration when water is available but they lose their leaves through rapid leaf shedding and enter dormancy under conditions of low water potential lambers et al 2008 the most apparent mechanism of the rapid accumulation of sugars in the leaves results immediately from the stress caused by the mobilization of carbohydrate reserves wang and stutte 1992 the changes in the carbohydrate composition that occurs in the leaves of drought stressed apple trees is caused by the induction of enzymatic pathways that break down starch and or sucrose as a result of enhanced starch to sugar conversion lambers et al 2008 reserve mobilization of stored carbohydrates is essential for shoot growth and flowering lopez et al 2007 the anna cultivar is one of the few apple cultivars that maintains productivity under hot desert conditions with irrigation importantly it has a reduced chilling requirement allowing for successful cultivation in warm winter zones the cultivar possesses several distinct physiognomies such as an early bearing fruit development period of almost 120 days and fruit ripening under extremely high day temperatures of more than 40 c miller and baker 1982 trejo gonzalez and soto valdez 1991 autumn irrigation determent had a positive effect on the phenological stages such as bud burst petal fall and fruit set dates thus these results are in agreement with martínez nicolás et al 2019 4 2 flowering density and fruit set the increase in the density of flowers on apple trees exposed to longer irrigation determent periods could be attributed to the accumulation of sugars in the phloem and xylem the increase in flower number occurs as a result of carbohydrate accumulation in the apical bud which is associated with the transition from the vegetative to flowering state in woody fruit trees mo et al 2013 additionally flowering is positively correlated with carbohydrate levels in the leaf phloem and xylem and water stress has been shown to strongly enhance flowering pingping et al 2017 flower density is influenced by increased vegetative growth which lengthens the distance between spurs and accordingly outcomes in a lower density blanco et al 2020 the relatively high fruit set percentages that we observed in the irrigation determent treatments could be attributed to early severe defoliation during the winter resulting in many flowers appearing in the following spring the rapid return and accumulation of sugars in the phloem and xylem of trees in the winter was caused by the mobilization of carbohydrate reserves which was indicated by the high fruit set percentages the determent irrigation could also affect starch and soluble carbohydrate concentrations in the roots fruit set flowering and first vegetative development primarily depend on carbohydrate reserves blanco et al 2020 thus fruit set is related to starch and soluble carbohydrate concentration although irrigation determent reduces carbon gain as a result of decreased leaf photosynthesis and partial defoliation klein et al 2001 the stress is not severe enough to directly affect flowering and fruiting when determent is temporary and irrigation is resumed before dormancy floral initiation can still be completed even though it stops during the determent period esparza et al 2001 4 3 fruit yield and yield increment percentage during water determent specific genes are induced for signal transduction in the water stress response including water channel proteins the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and nutrients and the phytohormones that are required for increasing bud growth and development zhu 2002 bray 2004 therefore water management can help improve yield the increase in productivity caused by postharvest water stress is attributed to increased flowering intensity and higher fruit set torrecilas et al 2000 larson et al 1988 found that postharvest water stress increased the productivity of peaches in the season following postharvest water stress which was probably related to a lower level of stress and pre winter irrigation the variation in yield between treatments could be due to stored carbohydrates as yield is dependent on photosynthetic carbohydrate availability lopez et al 2007 in contrast ebel et al 2001 and lopez et al 2006 reported significant reductions in crop yield in the years following water deficit stress which is a consequence of the reduction in root reserve accumulation in response to severe water stress it is possible that irrigation determent at different times during winter could affect yield by increasing the fruit set 4 4 fruit quality the use of irrigation determent at an appropriate time and for an appropriate duration can improve fruit production and fruit quality in terms of physical and chemical attributes girona et al 1997 the increase in the fruit firmness of water stressed trees could be an artifact of a decrement in fruit size as a direct impact of irrigation determent as the firmness of apples increases with decreases in fruit weight ebel et al 1993 however laribi et al 2013 found that excessive watering could have adverse effects on fruit quality nutrients contribute to the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments which increase in the leaves of the stressed trees due to higher photosynthetic activity leading to the production of more assimilates thus the accumulation of more assimilates could improve fruit chemical characteristics stino et al 2016 irrigation determent can enhance fruit quality by improving fruit taste which is associated with an increase in total soluble solids and other quality attributes such as color mpelasoka et al 2001 pérez pastor et al 2007 the determent irrigation treatments induced high tss which could explain the increase in anthocyanin synthesis additionally deficit irrigated trees typically exhibit reduced vegetative growth and the resultant exposure of fruit to sunlight can improve the red color of the fruit gelly et al 2003 intrigliolo et al 2013 4 5 nutritional status the processes of flower bud development root growth nutrient uptake reserve storage and winter acclimatization are affected by water stress kuroda et al 1985 autumnal leaf senescence is regulated by active sinks for carbohydrates and nutrients in the plant naschitz et al 2014 stino et al 2016 found a significant positive effect of increasing available soil water by decreasing the amount of water applied on the percentage of n p and k in the leaves of le conte pear leaf mineral content was affected by the timing of irrigation determent irrigation determent significantly decreased the leaf mineral content in apples by reducing the percentage of vegetative spurs produced in this context the decrease in chlorophyll content as a result of irrigation determent could be attributed to the sensitivity of photosynthetic pigments to drought stress resulting in the destruction of chlorophyll chai et al 2016 similarly šircelj et al 2005 reported a significantly lower chlorophyll index in deficit irrigated trees than control trees 5 conclusions specific irrigation determent timing and duration to improve the management of water resources is a promising technology the use of irrigation determent during autumn and the appropriate timing and period of irrigation determent have a positive impact on the nutritional status and productivity of fruit therefore this strategy can be applied to attain higher yields and fruit quality achieving the highest return from an orchard and contributing to producer profitability from the results of this study it can be concluded that irrigation determent during autumn particularly for 45 d from october 1st to november 14th t3 is an effective treatment to increase flowering fruiting spurs the productivity of anna apple trees and the non critical periods for apple agricultural practices declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

10066,seasonal freeze thaw processes affect soil water migration and distribution especially in semi arid agricultural areas these processes play an important role in mitigating harsh environmental conditions and wind erosion soil water content swc and soil temperature st were monitored at different depths 0 2 m and investigated under freeze thaw conditions from november 2018 to may 2019 in a semi arid agro pastoral region of northern china the initial swc was the main factor that affected the freeze thaw process during the freeze thaw process differences in soil thermal conductivity caused the soil to thaw faster than the freezing process and the upper soil layer 0 60 cm was significantly affected by temperature changes changes in the potential energy of water and pore pressure gradient caused the migration of soil water to the upper layer which led to a slight decrease in swc in each layer before st dropped to the freezing point the vertical migration distance of soil water exceeded 70 cm and the swc above a depth of 100 cm increased significantly as water was mainly obtained from the soil layer below a depth of 200 cm soil compaction was reduced when affected by freeze thaw processes and the soil particles were more fragmented leading to wind erosion and dust events our results partially explain the occurrence of wind erosion in spring and provide a scientific basis for predicting soil water status and appropriate farmland management strategies keywords farmland semi arid area freeze thaw process soil water content swc soil temperature st 1 introduction the freeze thaw process in soil has an important impact on the agro ecological environment wang et al 2019 this process promotes the migration of soil water and changes the water distribution and complex hydrothermal coupling ala et al 2016 evett et al 2012 stähli et al 2001 especially in spring freeze thaw processes change soil structure and affect soil particle migration which makes surface soil more prone to soil wind erosion ban et al 2016 the change in upper soil water content swc also influences the choice of irrigation strategy and resulting crop growth during spring dai et al 2019 the migration of water and soil particles also changes carbon and nitrogen cycling cn cycle in the soil d odorico et al 2003 with the increased cn cycle interaction with soil erosion some of the most important phases of these cycles such as decomposition leaching and plant uptake are impacted porporato et al 2003 ice crystal growth within soil voids forces particles apart and ice pressure may compress or rupture soil aggregates increasing the risk of soil erosion ferrick and gatto 2010 thereby affecting the microclimate and bringing about ecological changes huang et al 2020 in the process of soil freezing the soil water freezes into ice forming a freezing front below 0 ºc hou et al 2020 the soil freezing causes the soil water to move from unfrozen areas to the freezing front nagare et al 2012 which leads to a significant increase in swc in the frozen soil furthermore the swc distribution before the soil freezes in early winter affects the soil water status in the following year luo et al 2003 leading to an increase in field storage and a reduction in irrigation needs chen et al 2013 the rise in spring temperature causes the upper soil to thaw first while lower soil gradually thaws as the temperature increases hence the swc increase in the upper soil is more obvious yang et al 2008 and can become an important water source for plants and crops especially in an area with low precipitation accurately evaluating freeze thaw processes in different soils and regions is a critical part of ecological science agriculture and forestry management as well as the development of management strategies for agricultural freeze areas many researchers have studied the mechanism by which swc moves during the soil freeze thaw process in different areas and with different conditions nagare 2011 wang et al 2019 evaluation of the effects of different swc on the freeze thaw process showed that swc and soil properties had a great influence on freezing time and ground thermal condition at the same time liquid water and ice are in equilibrium under temperature changes due to the soil freezing regardless of the amount of water in the ice phase the content of liquid water may be relatively stable low et al 1968 in agricultural freeze zones the amount of water that migrates upward during the freeze thaw progress is controlled by the initial swc while a lower swc makes the soil more susceptible to freezing chen et al 2013 however the migration characteristics of soil water under freeze thaw conditions in semi arid agricultural areas have not been explored there is also less research on characteristics influencing soil water migration such as temperature change and related spatio temporal conditions on agricultural soil wind erosion events wang et al 2019 in china seasonal freeze thaw events mostly occur in arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2013 which have a crucial impact on the growth of crops however large scale soil degradation has caused serious problems including wind erosion and air pollution on farmland sun et al 2018 2019 chang et al 2019 as well as negative impacts on the regional environment low precipitation and significant seasonal changes as well as low swc cause wind induced soil erosion and low crop yield huang et al 2020 sun et al 2019 previous research indicated that the groundwater level is declining annually nakayama et al 2010 sun et al 2018 this phenomenon may cause the area to be in an extended dry state causing severe wind erosion on farmland however there is still a lack of understanding of the freeze thaw process and soil water dynamics in this area to address these gaps this research studied the characteristics of st and water migration during the soil freeze thaw process on farmland in a semi arid region to provide a reference for regional farmland management and wind induced soil erosion prevention and control 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site research was conducted in zhangbei country 40 01 42 17 n 114 05 115 20 e which is located in a semi arid agricultural freeze thaw area in north china fig 1a the annual precipitation is 320 mm and the altitude is about 1750 m precipitation is temporally concentrated with about 65 4 of precipitation occurring from june to september fig 2 there is a large difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures annual average temperature

soil erosion 2 2 freeze thaw process monitoring the root systems of the main crops and plants were distributed in the range of 0 200 cm in the study area liu et al 2020 leading us to investigate the 0 200 cm soil profile environmental data was measured simultaneously during the freeze thaw process using a standard automatic weather station located in an open space 20 m away from the study site precipitation mm temperature and relative humidity were measured at 15 minute intervals data logging used a battery powered hobo u30 nrc data logger onset computer corporation usa which is charged daily using a photovoltaic power source freeze thaw processes were measured 10 m away from the farmland the st and swc were measured at 15 minute intervals through ten 5te probes decagon usa placed at ten soil depths 10 30 50 70 90 110 130 150 170 and 190 cm in the study site data logging used a battery powered em50 data logger decagon usa the state of the soil was based on the st when the mean daily st was below 0 guo et al 2011a the soil began to freeze otherwise it starts to thaw measurements were taken from 1st nov 2018 26th may 2019 four soil stages were defined which included freezing soil was in the process of freezing completely frozen daily maximum soil temperature was 0 c thawing soil was in the process of thawing and completely thawed daily minimum soil temperature was 0 c guo et al 2011b the freezing point represents a soil temperature of 0 c one way analysis of variance anova and the least significant method lsd were used to test the significance of the differences the pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between air temperature and st 2 3 thermal regime of soil profiles the temperature transfer between different soil layers was analyzed using the soil heat transfer model proposed by hillel 2003 which indicates the heat transfer process in shallow soil during the freeze thaw process and reflects the time lag in heat transfer the diurnal variation of soil temperature can be expressed by t z t t a 0 sin ω t z d e z d where t z t is the temperature at z as a function of time t t is the average temperature at z depth and a 0 is the amplitude of the surface temperature fluctuation the range from maximum or minimum to average temperature finally ω is the radial frequency the constant d is called the damping depth which is related to the thermal properties of the soil and the frequency of the temperature fluctuation hillel 2003 this study assumed that surface soil temperature fluctuations were symmetrical 3 result 3 1 stratification of initial soil characteristics the initial swc and st profile are shown in fig 3 the lowest st occurred at the surface of the soil at 1 58 the st reached a maximum value of 5 95 at 1 m depth and decreased significantly when soil depth exceeded 1 m st changes were not obvious within the range of 1 2 m and st maintained around 3 at the beginning of soil freezing the st at all depths was above 0 each value was higher than the air temperature the swc also reached the maximum at 1 m depth and swc at 90 cm depth was nearly nine times higher than that at a depth of 110 cm the swc values at 110 130 150 170 and 190 cm were 2 02 1 98 3 38 1 58 and 2 12 respectively 3 2 the variation process of st surface soil 0 20 cm depth first started to freeze on 10th nov 2018 table 1 st was about 10 at a depth of 180 cm the upper soil froze earlier than the deep soil fig 4b and for every 20 cm increase in depth soil freezing was delayed for about seven days table 1 the frozen depth reached 100 cm after 42 days and after 67 days for 200 cm the freezing process was not steady once freezing was initiated since the air temperature fluctuated the air temperature was steady below 10 c from 10th december and there were two significant cooling events on 1st and 19th dec fig 4a during the freezing process st fluctuated significantly between 15 and 10 in the upper profile 0 60 cm the lowest st was 18 55 c at the surface layer and 2 95 c at a depth of 200 cm surface st rose above 0 and soil started to thaw on 16th mar 2019 fig 5 temperature fluctuations in this period were monitored under near freezing thawing conditions soil at depths of 100 and 200 cm began to thaw after 18 and 26 days respectively the first full thaw of the soil occurred in the surface soil on 25th april compared with the surface soil the total thawing time at 100 cm and 200 cm was delayed by 28 and 35 days respectively table 1 soils with a depth of 0 40 cm had greater temperature fluctuations during the thawing process and st fluctuations below 80 cm were not significantly affected by air temperature fig 5 after the thawing progress the st at a depth of 100 200 cm was maintained at around 7 the average time from the start to full thawing was about 26 days in which the upper soil 0 80 cm thawed faster with an average time of 21 days and the 80 200 cm depth soil took about 30 days in addition st was positively correlated with air temperature except from depths of 160 200 cm table 2 compared with the upper soil deep soil below 60 cm was less affected by air temperature fig 5 fig 6 shows the dynamic response of surface st 0 60 cm to air temperature upper st 0 60 cm had a strong linear correlation with the air temperature y ax b regression was able to explain changes of more than 68 5 coefficient a represents the thermal efficiency between air and soil in the equation which changes with soil properties larger values of a indicated that the heat transfer between st and air temperature was faster at had a significant relationship with sts in the upper layers fig 6 p 0 05 the closer to the surface the faster the st responded to changes in air temperature the soil heat transfer model was used to simulate the change in shallow st 0 60 cm which showed sinusoidal fluctuations of st in the shallow layer fig 7 among which the fluctuations at depths from 0 to 40 cm were more apparent when compared with the time when the st of the 0 20 cm depth was at its peak during the freezing stage st at 20 40 cm depths lagged by about six hours and st at 40 60 cm depths lagged by about 13 h fig 7a during the completely frozen stage the amplitude of st in each layer increased significantly fig 7b compared with the time when the st of the 0 20 cm depth peaked the st at 20 40 and 40 60 cm depths lagged by about 4 and 10 h respectively during the thawing period the amplitude was smaller than that of completely frozen stage fig 7c but it was still larger than that of the freezing stage compared with depths of 0 20 cm the peak time of the st for the 0 20 and 40 60 cm depths lagged by about 6 and 11 5 h respectively during the completely thawed period the amplitude in each layer decreased significantly fig 7d and the sinusoidal fluctuation at 40 60 cm depth was not apparent the lag time during this period at the 20 40 cm layer was 8 h compared with that at the 0 20 cm depth 3 3 the variation process of swc the changes in swc at different soil layers are shown in fig 8 there were significant differences in swc in each layer before the freezing process fig 8b with swc at a 80 100 cm depth reaching a maximum of 18 99 affected by the two cooler weather temperatures weathers on the 3rd and 5th of december fig 8a soils at 0 20 cm froze rapidly as air temperature dropped from 2 1 c to 22 6 c in a short period of time then the frozen layer extended downward from 10th january the soil layer in the range of 0 200 cm was completely frozen the swc decreased significantly after the freezing front since there was a stable phase from freezing to thawing this phase lasted longer in deeper soil fig 8b st of the 0 20 cm depth fluctuated considerably from 16th march to 5th april 2019 fig 8b leading to a rapid thawing of the surface soil and a significant increase in swc during thawing swc at depths of 0 100 cm increased slightly compared with that before freezing which indicated the upward migration of soil water the swc at 10 30 50 70 and 90 cm depths increased by 85 7 123 51 43 7 and 29 2 respectively but it had little effect on the deeper layers the air temperature began to gradually increase after 5th april and the swc increased rapidly because there was no significant precipitation in the non growing season in the study area fig 2 sun et al 2019 swc was less affected by precipitation the swc within 0 100 cm depth changed significantly during the freeze thaw process and the swc at the 90 cm depth was the highest during this period fig 9a swc below 100 cm decreased significantly after the freeze thaw process the swc above 140 cm increased with that at depths of 50 cm increasing the most by 4 9 mm fig 9b the swc at a depth of 150 cm was reduced by 1 9 mm while the swc at 170 and 190 cm were almost unchanged this phenomenon suggests that soil water at a depth of 150 cm may have moved up to a depth of 110 130 cm during the entire freeze thaw process there was a significant difference between the swc at the 90 cm depth and that at the deeper soil indicating that the soil water may have been transported vertically upward from deeper soil 3 4 freezing and thawing front the development of the soil freezing and thawing front with depth varied over the study period fig 10 as each layer of soil froze more slowly than it thawed the freezing front penetrated to a depth of 60 cm for 13 days 12th 25th nov 2018 fig 10a however it took much longer for the thawing front to reach the same depth 23rd mar 13th apr 2019 fig 10b unlike the frozen front as it propagated from surface to deep soil in fig 8a the propagation of the thawing front was interrupted at depths of 70 110 and 170 cm fig 10b the duration of these melting fronts varied widely at depths of 110 170 cm fig 10b possibly due to differences in soil properties 4 discussion 4 1 freeze thaw characteristics of soil the freeze thaw process in soil is a complex change of chemical physical and mechanical phenomena which includes energy water transfer and salt accumulation li et al 2008 qi et al 2018 according to observed swc and st data the freeze thaw characteristics of soils at different depths were determined the winter freeze up stage began when the freezing process of the active layer finished and it lasted approximately 200 days the freeze thaw process had obvious stratification at a depth of 90 cm before freezing within the depth range of 0 100 cm swc gradually increased with depth and the freezing process took place quickly fig 7b during the freezing process the freezing peak slowly extended downward and slowed when it reached a depth of 90 cm related to the lower swc at this depth during the complete freezing stage soil at depths from 80 to 100 cm maintained a relatively high swc which may be due to the release of heat during the solidification of the soil water at the stable freezing stage leaving the soil in this layer not completely frozen the above phenomena may be related to differences in the initial swc ala et al 2016 wang et al 2019 our research confirmed this view the freeze thaw processes of soil at different depths were significantly different due to differences in initial swc the swc below 90 cm was significantly reduced as it had a greater relationship with soil texture arredondo et al 2018 the swc of unfrozen soil increased with the increase of clay content stähli and stadler 1997 as soil particles gradually grow in size with increasing depth in the sedimentary cycle and the deeper soil consists of coarser soil particles for this reason the swc in upper soil may be higher than that of deeper soils furthermore the water repellent layer blocks the vertical transport of water and leads to insignificant changes in soil during the freeze thaw process wei et al 2016 the transfer rate of soil temperature is related to the thermal conductivity some studies have pointed out that different soil thermal conductivity is mainly due to swc yi et al 2014 since the thermal conductivity of ice is about four times higher than that of liquid water campbell 1985 a lower swc may make the soil have a higher thermal conductivity in the soil freezing stage higher swc will slow down the freeze thaw process and the freeze and thaw time will be extended as other studies have shown wang et al 2019 when the soil begins to thaw the ice in frozen soil promotes heat transfer which confirms that the thawing rate of the soil is greater than the freezing rate in our study 4 2 the freeze thaw cycle affects the redistribution of swc the dynamic distribution of swc reflects the water and energy state of the soil which depends on water soil interactions and the physical properties of the soil chen et al 2013 during the freezing progress unfrozen water in the soil moves to the frozen area driven by the water potential difference which is manifested by soil water accumulation at the frozen layer e g water is transported upward meanwhile the increase of soil water at the frozen layer reduces the rate that the soil freezes which provides enough time for the soil water to transport upward our research also proved that the freezing rate gradually decreased during the freezing process fig 7b when the soil began to freeze the water potential gradient was the primary factor driving the soil water to migrate vertically soil freezing lowers the water potential and creates a free energy gradient along which water will flow from unfrozen soil to frozen soil then before the st dropped to the freezing point the water in the frozen soil was redistributed to the freezing front dirksen and miller 1966 the phenomenon of decreasing swc was observed at various depths before the temperature dropped to the freezing point fig 7b which was consistent with others results dirksen and miller 1966 this phenomenon indicated that the existence of the water potential gradient is a necessary condition for a certain amount of soil water to flow to the freezing front the largest soil water potential appeared at a depth of 100 cm and soil water moved up rapidly under the combined influence of the

10066,seasonal freeze thaw processes affect soil water migration and distribution especially in semi arid agricultural areas these processes play an important role in mitigating harsh environmental conditions and wind erosion soil water content swc and soil temperature st were monitored at different depths 0 2 m and investigated under freeze thaw conditions from november 2018 to may 2019 in a semi arid agro pastoral region of northern china the initial swc was the main factor that affected the freeze thaw process during the freeze thaw process differences in soil thermal conductivity caused the soil to thaw faster than the freezing process and the upper soil layer 0 60 cm was significantly affected by temperature changes changes in the potential energy of water and pore pressure gradient caused the migration of soil water to the upper layer which led to a slight decrease in swc in each layer before st dropped to the freezing point the vertical migration distance of soil water exceeded 70 cm and the swc above a depth of 100 cm increased significantly as water was mainly obtained from the soil layer below a depth of 200 cm soil compaction was reduced when affected by freeze thaw processes and the soil particles were more fragmented leading to wind erosion and dust events our results partially explain the occurrence of wind erosion in spring and provide a scientific basis

of soil freezing the soil water freezes into ice forming a freezing front below 0 ºc hou et al 2020 the soil freezing causes the soil water to move from unfrozen areas to the freezing front nagare et al 2012 which leads to a significant increase in swc in the frozen soil furthermore the swc distribution before the soil freezes in early winter affects the soil water status in the following year luo et al 2003 leading to an increase in field storage and a reduction in irrigation needs chen et al 2013 the rise in spring temperature causes the upper soil to thaw first while lower soil gradually thaws as the temperature increases hence the swc increase in the upper soil is more obvious yang et al 2008 and can become an important water source for plants and crops especially in an area with low precipitation accurately evaluating freeze thaw processes in different soils and regions is a critical part of ecological science agriculture and forestry management as well as the development of management strategies for agricultural freeze areas many researchers have studied the mechanism by which swc moves during the soil freeze thaw process in different areas and with different conditions nagare 2011 wang et al 2019 evaluation of the effects of different swc on the freeze thaw process showed that swc and soil properties had a great influence on freezing time and ground thermal condition at the same time liquid water and ice are in equilibrium under temperature changes due to the soil freezing regardless of the amount of water in the ice phase the content of liquid water may be relatively stable low et al 1968 in agricultural freeze zones the amount of water that migrates upward during the freeze thaw progress is controlled by the initial swc while a lower swc makes the soil more susceptible to freezing chen et al 2013 however the migration characteristics of soil water under freeze thaw conditions in semi arid agricultural areas have not been explored there is also less research on characteristics influencing soil water migration such as temperature change and related spatio temporal conditions on agricultural soil wind erosion events wang et al 2019 in china seasonal freeze thaw events mostly occur in arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2013 which have a crucial impact on the growth of crops however large scale soil degradation has caused serious problems including wind erosion and air pollution on farmland sun et al 2018 2019 chang et al 2019 as well as negative impacts on the regional environment low precipitation and significant seasonal changes as well as low swc cause wind induced soil erosion and low crop yield huang et al 2020 sun et al 2019 previous research indicated that the groundwater level is declining annually nakayama et al 2010 sun et al 2018 this phenomenon may cause the area to be in an extended dry state causing severe wind erosion on farmland however there is still a lack of understanding of the freeze thaw process and soil water dynamics in this area to address these gaps this research studied the characteristics of st and water migration during the soil freeze thaw process on farmland in a semi arid region to provide a reference for regional farmland management and wind induced soil erosion prevention and control 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site research was conducted in zhangbei country 40

temporally concentrated with about 65 4 of precipitation occurring from june to september fig 2 there is a large difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures annual average temperature

reaching 16 the soil depth ranges to 450 cm and is mainly composed of sandy soil the main forest species is populus simonii carr fig 1b which were first planted in the 1960 s to prevent wind induced soil erosion 2 2 freeze thaw process monitoring the root systems of the main crops and plants were distributed in the range of 0 200 cm in the study area liu et al 2020 leading us to investigate the 0 200 cm soil profile environmental data was measured simultaneously during the freeze thaw process using a standard automatic weather station located in an open space 20 m away from the study site precipitation mm temperature and relative humidity were measured at 15 minute intervals data logging used a battery powered hobo u30 nrc data logger onset computer corporation usa which is charged

daily st was below 0 guo et al 2011a the soil began to freeze otherwise it starts to thaw measurements were taken from 1st nov 2018 26th may 2019 four soil stages were defined which included freezing soil was in the process of freezing completely frozen daily maximum soil temperature was 0 c thawing soil was in the process of thawing and completely thawed daily minimum soil temperature was 0 c guo et al 2011b the freezing point represents a soil temperature of 0 c one way analysis of variance anova and the least significant method lsd were used to test the significance of the differences the pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between air temperature and st 2 3 thermal regime of soil profiles the temperature transfer between different soil layers was analyzed using the soil heat transfer model proposed by hillel 2003 which indicates the heat transfer process in shallow soil during the freeze thaw process and reflects the time lag in heat transfer the diurnal variation of soil temperature can be expressed by t z t t a 0 sin ω t z d e z d where t z t is the temperature at z as a function of time t t is the average temperature at z depth and a 0 is the amplitude of the surface temperature fluctuation the range from maximum or minimum to average temperature finally ω is the radial frequency the constant d is called the damping depth which is related to the thermal properties of the soil and the frequency of the temperature fluctuation hillel 2003 this study assumed that surface soil temperature fluctuations were symmetrical 3 result 3 1 stratification of initial soil characteristics the initial swc and st profile are shown in fig 3 the lowest st occurred at the surface of the soil at 1 58 the st reached a maximum value of 5 95 at 1 m depth and decreased significantly when soil depth exceeded 1 m st changes were not obvious within the range of 1 2 m and st maintained around 3 at the beginning of soil freezing the st at all depths was above 0 each value was higher than the air temperature the swc also reached the maximum at 1 m depth and swc at 90 cm depth was nearly nine times higher than that at a depth of 110 cm the swc values at 110 130 150 170 and 190 cm were 2 02 1 98 3 38 1 58 and 2 12 respectively 3 2 the variation process of st surface soil 0 20 cm depth first started to freeze on 10th nov 2018 table 1 st was about 10 at a depth of 180 cm the upper soil froze earlier than the deep soil fig 4b and for every 20 cm increase in depth soil freezing was delayed for about seven days table 1 the frozen depth reached 100 cm after 42 days and after 67 days for 200 cm the freezing process was not steady once freezing was initiated since the air temperature fluctuated the air temperature was steady below 10 c from 10th december and there were two significant cooling events on 1st and 19th dec fig 4a during the freezing process st fluctuated significantly between 15 and 10 in the upper profile 0 60 cm the lowest st was 18 55 c at the surface layer and 2 95 c at a depth of 200 cm surface st rose above 0 and soil started to thaw on 16th mar 2019 fig 5 temperature fluctuations in this period were monitored under near freezing thawing conditions soil at depths of 100 and 200 cm began to thaw after 18 and 26 days respectively the first full thaw of the soil occurred in the surface soil on 25th april compared with the surface soil the total thawing time at 100 cm and 200 cm was delayed by 28 and 35 days respectively table 1 soils with a depth of 0 40 cm had greater temperature fluctuations during the thawing process and st fluctuations below 80 cm were not significantly affected by air temperature fig 5 after the thawing progress the st at a depth of 100 200 cm was maintained at around 7 the average time from the start to full thawing was about 26 days in which the upper soil 0 80 cm thawed faster with an average time of 21 days and the 80 200 cm depth soil took about 30 days in addition st was positively correlated with air temperature except from depths of 160 200 cm table 2 compared with the upper soil deep soil below 60 cm was less affected by air temperature fig 5 fig 6 shows the dynamic response of surface st 0 60 cm to air temperature upper st 0 60 cm had a strong linear correlation with the air temperature y ax b regression was able to explain changes of more than 68 5 coefficient a represents the thermal efficiency between air and soil in the equation which changes with soil properties larger values of a indicated that the heat transfer between st and air temperature was faster at had a significant relationship with sts in the upper layers fig 6 p 0 05 the closer to the surface the faster the st responded to changes in air temperature the soil heat transfer model was used to simulate the change in shallow st 0 60 cm which showed sinusoidal fluctuations of st in the shallow layer fig 7 among which the fluctuations at depths from 0 to 40 cm were more apparent when compared with the time when the st of the 0 20 cm depth was at its peak during the freezing stage st at 20 40 cm depths lagged by about six hours and st at 40 60 cm depths lagged by about 13 h fig 7a during the completely frozen stage the amplitude of st in each layer increased significantly fig 7b compared with the time when the st of the 0 20 cm depth peaked the st at 20 40 and 40 60 cm depths lagged by about 4 and 10 h respectively during the thawing period the amplitude was smaller than that of completely frozen stage fig 7c but it was still larger than that of the freezing stage compared with depths of 0 20 cm the peak time of the st for the 0 20 and 40 60 cm depths lagged by about 6 and 11 5 h respectively during the completely thawed period the amplitude in each layer decreased significantly fig 7d and the sinusoidal fluctuation at 40 60 cm depth was not apparent the lag time during this period at the 20 40 cm layer was 8 h compared with that at the 0 20 cm depth 3 3 the variation process of swc the changes in swc at different soil layers are shown in fig 8 there were significant differences in swc in each layer before the freezing process fig 8b with swc at a 80 100 cm depth reaching a maximum of 18 99 affected by the two cooler weather temperatures weathers on the 3rd and 5th of december fig 8a soils at 0 20 cm froze rapidly as air temperature dropped from 2 1 c to 22 6 c in a short period of time then the frozen layer extended downward from 10th january the soil layer in the range of 0 200 cm was completely frozen the swc decreased significantly after the freezing front since there was a stable phase from freezing to thawing this phase lasted longer in deeper soil fig 8b st of the 0 20 cm depth fluctuated considerably from 16th march to 5th april 2019 fig 8b leading to a rapid thawing of the surface soil and a significant increase in swc during thawing swc at depths of 0 100 cm increased slightly compared with that before freezing which indicated the upward migration of soil water the swc at 10 30 50 70 and 90 cm depths increased by 85 7 123 51 43 7 and 29 2 respectively but it had little effect on the deeper layers the air temperature began to gradually increase after 5th april and the swc increased rapidly because there was no significant precipitation in the non growing season in the study area fig 2 sun et al 2019 swc was less affected by precipitation the swc within 0 100 cm depth changed significantly during the freeze thaw process and the swc at the 90 cm depth was the highest during this period fig 9a swc below 100 cm decreased significantly after the freeze thaw process the swc above 140 cm increased with that at depths of 50 cm increasing the most by 4 9 mm fig 9b the swc at a depth of 150 cm was reduced by 1 9 mm while the swc at 170 and 190 cm were almost unchanged this phenomenon suggests that soil water at a depth of 150 cm may have moved up to a depth of 110 130 cm during the entire freeze thaw process there was a significant difference between the swc at the 90 cm depth and that at the deeper soil indicating that the soil water may have been transported vertically upward from deeper soil 3 4 freezing and thawing front the development of the soil freezing and thawing front with depth varied over the study period fig 10 as each layer of soil froze more slowly than it thawed the freezing front penetrated to a depth of 60 cm for 13 days 12th 25th nov 2018 fig 10a however it took much longer for the thawing front to reach the same depth 23rd mar 13th apr 2019 fig 10b unlike the frozen front as it propagated from surface to deep soil in fig 8a the propagation of the thawing front was interrupted at depths of 70 110 and 170 cm fig 10b the duration of these melting fronts varied widely at depths of 110 170 cm fig 10b possibly due to differences in soil properties 4 discussion 4 1 freeze thaw characteristics of soil the freeze thaw process in soil is a complex change of chemical physical and mechanical phenomena which includes energy water transfer and salt accumulation li et al 2008 qi et al 2018 according to observed swc and st data the freeze thaw characteristics of soils at different depths were determined the winter freeze up stage began when the freezing process of the active layer finished and it lasted approximately 200 days the freeze thaw process had obvious stratification at a depth of 90 cm before freezing within the depth range of 0 100 cm swc gradually increased with depth and the freezing process took place quickly fig 7b during the freezing process the freezing peak slowly extended downward and slowed when it reached a depth of 90 cm related to the lower swc at this depth during the complete freezing stage soil at depths from 80 to 100 cm maintained a relatively high swc which may be due to the release of heat during the solidification of the soil water at the stable freezing stage leaving the soil in this layer not completely frozen the above phenomena may be related to differences in the initial swc ala et al 2016 wang et al 2019 our research confirmed this view the freeze thaw processes of soil at different depths were significantly different due to differences in initial swc the swc below 90 cm was significantly reduced as it had a greater relationship with soil texture arredondo et al 2018 the swc of unfrozen soil increased with the increase of clay content stähli and stadler 1997 as soil particles gradually grow in size with increasing depth in the sedimentary cycle and the deeper soil consists of coarser soil particles for this reason the swc in upper soil may be higher than that of deeper soils furthermore the water repellent layer blocks the vertical transport of water and leads to insignificant changes in soil during the freeze thaw process wei et al 2016 the transfer rate of soil temperature is related to the thermal conductivity some studies have pointed out that different soil thermal conductivity is mainly due to swc yi et al 2014 since the thermal conductivity of ice is about four times higher than that of liquid water campbell 1985 a lower swc may make the soil have a higher thermal conductivity in the soil freezing stage higher swc will slow down the freeze thaw process and the freeze and thaw time will be extended as other studies have shown wang et al 2019 when the soil begins to thaw the ice in frozen soil promotes heat transfer which confirms that the thawing rate of the soil is greater than the freezing rate in our study 4 2 the freeze thaw cycle affects the redistribution of swc the dynamic distribution of swc reflects the water and energy state of the soil which depends on water soil interactions and the physical properties of the soil chen et al 2013 during the freezing progress unfrozen water in the soil moves to the frozen area driven by the water potential difference which is manifested by soil water accumulation at the frozen layer e g water is transported upward meanwhile the increase of soil water at the frozen layer reduces the rate that the soil freezes which provides enough time for the soil water to transport upward our research also proved that the freezing rate gradually decreased during the freezing process fig 7b when the soil began to freeze the water potential gradient was the primary factor driving the soil water to migrate vertically soil freezing lowers the water potential and creates a free energy gradient along which water will flow from unfrozen soil to frozen soil then before the st dropped to the freezing point the water in the frozen soil was redistributed to the freezing front dirksen and miller 1966 the phenomenon of decreasing swc was observed at various depths before the temperature dropped to the freezing point fig 7b which was consistent with others results dirksen and miller 1966 this phenomenon indicated that the existence of the water potential gradient is a necessary condition for a certain amount of soil water to flow to the freezing front the largest soil water potential appeared at a depth of 100 cm and soil water moved up rapidly under the combined influence of the temperature difference and water potential making the swc above 100 cm increase significantly however the soil water potential was decreased due to the temperature difference and the formation of ice nagare et al 2012 which slowed the downward flow of water during the freezing process making the change in swc from 100 to 200 cm not apparent fig 9b in addition the freeze thaw cycle may also significantly impact soil physical properties viklander 1998 which affects the soil water distribution the unfrozen water retained in the soil forms a large pore pressure gradient in the cold warm junction area due to the existence of pore pressure a soil with large pores can transport water to an area with small pores chen et al 2013 this phenomenon can also partially explain the redistribution of soil water from depths of 100 cm to the upper layer fig 9a 4 3 implications for managing wind induced erosion on farmland the freeze thaw cycle is an important factor influencing soil water conditions in agricultural areas and can change the physical properties of the soil viklander 1998 freeze thaw cycles increase the possibility of soil erosion by destroying soil bonds ala et al 2016 especially in windy farmland areas practically some studies attempted to use water migration during the seasonal freeze thaw process to improve farmland and forest water status in spring yi

the rate of crop et grown under standard conditions etc and that for actual conditions etc act standard conditions refer to crops grown under optimum soil water nutrient and pest management are disease free and achieve full production for the given climate allen et al 1998 if any of these conditions fall short then the usage of etc act is preferred the fao56 method calculates daily etc for a given crop as the kc times the daily pm eto however fao56 includes procedures for the more comprehensive dual kc method where daily etc is calculated by separating the single kc into two coefficients the basal crop coefficient kcb to estimate crop transpiration tc and the soil evaporation coefficient ke to estimate evaporation e as in eq 1 1 etc kcb ke eto when crops are grown in non standard conditions such as under soil water or salinity stress fao56 incorporates coefficients to adjust the standard condition etc denoted as etc adj for example when soil water conditions in the crop root zone drop below a given threshold the kcb is multiplied by the water stress coefficient ks 1 eq 2 thus adjusted tc due to water stress is decreased below the amount calculated under standard conditions when water stress does not occur ks 1 in eq 2 because e is combined with tc in the single kc fao56 suggests ks adjustment is generally more appropriate for the dual than single kc method 2 etc adj kskcb ke eto cotton gossypium hirsutum l is grown in many arid and semiarid lands worldwide including the southwestern united states usda nass 2019 tables 2 3 where annual crop water use requirements can be up to 1000 mm erie et al 1982 however water for irrigation has been dwindling due to the prolonged drought in the us southwest thompson et al 2009 castle et al 2014 ganjegunte and clark 2017 and in other arid and semiarid countries where cotton is produced such as india and australia mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water shortages have prompted cotton growers to implement more efficient irrigation systems such as low energy sprinkler and drip irrigation thompson et al 2009 lamm et al 2012 goebel and lascano 2019 subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems where drip tape is installed below the soil surface are intended for multi year use lamm et al 2012 which is suitable for monoculture cotton as practiced in central arizona usa thompson et al 2009 lamm et al 2012 ayars et al 2015 summarized the advantages in adopting sdi over conventional surface irrigation methods in production of cotton and other crops namely water savings due to reduced evaporation runoff and deep percolation losses and enhanced growth higher yields and produce quality from better timing and placement of water and nutrients ayars et al 2015 reviewed a number of cotton studies in california usa that demonstrated significant yield increases and irrigation water use reductions using sdi over various surface irrigation methods although that review did not provide measurements of crop et for the cotton studies it is conceivable that the tc component of etc may have been higher in the cotton using sdi than in surface irrigation since soil evaporation is less with sdi currently cotton growers in areas such as the southern high plains of texas usa are using sdi systems for applying deficit irrigation a practice where the crop et demands are not fully met howell et al 2004 thompson et al 2009 goebel and lascano 2019 in these areas sufficient water for optimum cotton irrigation is generally not available lamm et al 2012 indicates sdi is used for deficit irrigation because it offers greater economic returns to growers compared to deficit irrigation with sprinklers analyses by castle et al 2014 and scanlon et al 2016 conclude that water allotments for us states such as arizona in the colorado river basin are overtaxed therefore growers in these western us states are now or will soon likely be forced to tolerate having less water than needed to fully irrigate crops this has generally not been an issue for arizona growers until recently information regarding cotton water use using deficit irrigation management in the hot arid climate of arizona is practically non existent appropriate mid season kc and kcb values are most critical in developing the fao56 segmented curves because these values ultimately affect etc estimation for the other growth stages fao56 proposed mid season cotton kc and kcb values for the standard climate of 1 15 1 2 and 1 10 1 15 respectively the standard coefficients are then adjusted in fao56 procedures for use in the local climate generally upward in arid and semi arid climates and downward in humid climates when cotton mid season kc and kcb values are derived with measurements at different climatic locations they can vary widely the review and update of fao56 crop coefficients pereira et al 2020 reported locally observed cotton mid season kc values for 13 recent worldwide studies that were considered to be conducted with optimum management and reliable measurement systems however after adjustment to standard climate the resulting values were found to be highly variable and generally inconsistent with the proposed fao56 mid season cotton kc i e kc varied from 0 88 to 1 22 with an average of 1 06 although pereira et al 2020 reported only six studies having locally observed cotton mid season kcb values the values when adjusted to the fao56 standard climate were more in line with the fao56 kcb and less variable 1 02 1 21 with an average of 1 12 albeit four of the six studies in the report were in arizona while the transferability of the standard fao56 coefficients is generally appropriate locally developed kcb values based on research studies can be more suitable as they more effectively reflect the actual local conditions cultural practices and crop varieties used allen et al 1998 however local modifications of the fao56 standard crop coefficients should not deviate by more than 0 20 allen et al 1998 hunsaker et al 2005 derived local mid season cotton kcb of 1 2 in studies using furrow irrigation in maricopa arizona later hunsaker et al 2015 found that the mid season cotton kcb was also about 1 2 in level basin irrigation experiments at the same maricopa location the mid season kcb were determined for cotton grown with overhead sprinkler irrigation at maricopa by thorp et al 2017 whose data indicated values were also on the order of 1 2 the mid season kcb in the studies when adjusted to the standard climate would be about 1 11 or towards the lower range of the cotton kcb proposed by fao56 i e 1 10 1 15 the hypotheses are that cotton crop coefficients and growth stage lengths in this desert climate are the same regardless of irrigation method however these suppositions have not yet been confirmed by research when cotton is grown by sdi the present paper analyzes crop et crop coefficients and growth stage lengths for cotton at the maricopa location using sdi the data were evaluated in a three year study conducted from 2016 to 2018 which included well watered and deficit irrigation treatments bronson et al 2019 the objectives were to determine the appropriate crop coefficient data and growth stage lengths for cotton grown using sdi another objective of the study was to determine the parameters used to model the water stress coefficient which can be used as a means to estimate the reduction in crop et when deficit irrigation is used 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site crop establishment and treatments cotton gossypium hirsutum l crops were grown with sdi in 2016 2017 and 2018 on a 1 2 ha field site at the maricopa agricultural center mac in maricopa arizona usa 33 067 degree n 111 97 degree w 360 m above sea level the location is within a hot arid low desert region of the us southwest where cotton is typically planted in april and harvested in sept nov historically rainfall during the cotton season at mac is 75 mm hunsaker et al 2015 the soil is a casa grande sandy loam sandy clay loam fine loamy mixed superactive hyperthermic typic natrargid bronson et al 2019 the field site soil profile has average sand silt and clay contents of 62 14 and 24 respectively average volumetric water content at field capacity fc and wilting point wp of 0 268 and 0 140 m3 m 3 respectively and an average available water holding capacity of 128 mm m 1 hunsaker et al 2019 in march of each cotton year pre plant soil samples to a depth of 1 8 m were collected at four locations in the center bed of 15 treatment plots each plot eight 1 02 m bed rows wide by 100 m long fig 1 soil was sampled in 0 3 m increments using a tractor mounted soil sampling unit the samples were oven dried at 60 c ground to 1 mm extracted with 1 m kcl and analyzed for nh4

15 m high raised beds in the 15 treatment plots following each cotton planting irrigation was applied to all plots during the succeeding 7 9 days to promote uniform crop establishment total irrigation applied for crop establishment was 92 195 and 143 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively final plant stands were consistently near 10 plants m 1 in all years bronson et al 2019 a cotton population considered optimum when grown on 1 02 m rows deltapine 2019 adams et al 2019 the cotton studies previously described by bronson et al 2019 were a randomized block design with five treatments and three replications fig 1 treatment assignments to plots remained the same for all three cotton years the study consisted of three n treatments denoted as soil test based stb n reflectance based ref n and zero n full details on the methodology used for the n treatments in these cotton studies were previously reported by bronson et al 2019 within the stb and zero n treatments were two treatments of irrigation full denoted as 100 irrigation and deficit denoted as 70 irrigation the ref n treatment was only at the 100 irrigation treatment although the study included five treatments for the present paper purpose only the six stb n treatment plots of fig 1 are considered since the treatment was managed at an optimum n rate thus the stb treatment plants were not n limited at any time during the seasons bronson et al 2019 after crop establishment irrigation scheduling described later in section 2 3 commenced for treatments on april 29 april 27 and april 27 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 2 2 subsurface drip irrigation system and fertigation a 15 station sdi system was used in the studies the sdi system was designed to provide metered water and n to the 15 individual plots the irrigation flow rate and totalized flow volume for each plot were monitored with flow meters and 103 kpa pressure reducers were in each plot s irrigation entry point drip irrigation tape was buried 0 22 m below each raised bed in 2016 new tape was installed in early 2017 and buried at 0 28 m below beds for the 2017 and 2018 cotton seasons the drip tape spaced at 1 02 m rows was placed beneath the center of each cotton bed to be near the plant roots emitter spacing was 0 5 m in 2016 and was 0 3 m in 2017 and 2018 flow rate per emitter was 1 1 l hr 1 in 2016 and 0 6 l hr 1 in 2017 and 2018 metered urea ammonium nitrate 32 n was fertigated through the irrigation lines in 24 events over approximately 40 days coinciding with the cotton pin head square date to the mid bloom date the fertigation periods were from may 25 to june 30 2016 may 15 to june 23 2017 and may 1 to june 8 2018 in season fertilizer applied to the optimum n treatments totaled 175 172 and 224 kg n ha 1 for the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively 2 3 irrigation scheduling irrigation scheduling of the 100 treatment in each year was based on a daily soil water balance swb model of the cotton rooting depth zr which estimated root zone depletion dr at the end of each day eq 3 3 dr i dr i 1 pi ii etc i dpi where dr i and dr i 1 are the root zone depletion mm at the end of day i and day i 1 respectively and pi ii etc i and dpi are amounts of precipitation net irrigation depth crop et and deep percolation respectively on day i all in units of mm the inputs for ii were average measured irrigation depths given to the 100 treatment replicates inputs of pi were provided by the university of arizona meteorological network azmet https cals arizona edu azmet weather station at mac located about 100 m from the field site daily values of total available water tawi of the daily rooting depth zr i were calculated as 4 tawi 1000 zr i fc wp where tawi is in mm zr i in m and fc and wp were 0 268 and 0 140 m3 m 3 respectively which were field average fc and wp values determined previously for the site hunsaker et al 2019 the limits for dr i in eq 3 were zero at fc and taw at wp the zr i were increased from an initial value of 0 40 m at planting to a maximum of 1 5 m at mid season increase of zr i was proportional to the increase in daily kcb kcb i whose estimation are described below initiation of the swb was on the day of planting where the initial dr i was assumed to be 50 mm in each year or the taw for an initial zr i of 0 40 m locally derived cotton kcb values and growth stage lengths by hunsaker et al 2005 were used to construct an fao56 segmented daily kcb i curve that was used for irrigation scheduling in all three years the kcb for the initial growth stage kcb ini used in the curve was 0 15 as recommended for cotton in fao56 the mid season kcb kcb mid value was 1 20 and the end of season kcb kcb end value was 0 51 the durations used for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages were 31 51 50 and 23 days respectively for an expected 155 day cotton season it is noted that the local kcb and growth stage data used in the sdi study for irrigation scheduling were derived under furrow irrigation the estimated etc i for the swb of eq 3 were calculated using the fao56 dual crop coefficient procedures allen et al 1998 which include adjustment calculations to reduce etc i due to the effects of soil water stress thus estimated etc i for eq 3 were the daily adjusted values etc i adj according to eq 2 which includes the ks coefficient calculation equations for determining daily ks ks i are described below in brief ks i vary from zero to 1 0 and depend on the dr i and the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p allen et al 1998 when the calculated ks i is 1 0 etc i adj is equal to etc i if ks i is less than 1 0 etc i adj etc i daily pm eto and weather data that are used in calculating eq 2 were provided by the azmet station at mac the 100 irrigation treatment was managed to replace etc i adj with i and or p while maintaining the swb such that the daily soil water depletion swdi eq 5 30 5 swdi 100 x 1 tawi dr i tawi where swdi is in percent and tawi and dr i are as previously defined a daily water stress coefficient ks i was calculated by eq 6 6 ks i tawi dr i 1 pi tawi where ks i tawi and dr i are as previously defined and pi is the fraction of tawi that can be extracted from the root zone without suffering water stress the pi values were adjusted daily from a baseline value of 0 65 recommended for cotton in fao56 for days when estimated etc i adj was equal to 5 0 mm d 1 to pi 0 65 0 04 5 etc i adj on days when etc i adj differed from 5 0 mm d 1 for scheduling purposes if a ks i on a given day i was estimated to be less than 1 0 in the swb model then the ks i on day i was applied to reduce etc i on the next day i 1 this resulted in etc i adj less than etc i on day i 1 however in keeping the modeled swdi to less than 30 for the 100 treatment the daily ks i were always computed as 1 0 except for seven and three days well after irrigation had been terminated 2016 and 2017 respectively estimated ks i was never less than 1 0 for the entire 2018 cotton year daily values of ke ke i were estimated following irrigation or precipitation by computing eq 7 fao56 eq 71 which requires a daily swb of the surface soil layer here assumed as 0 1 m in thickness 7 ke i min kr i kcmax i kcb i few i x kcmax i the kr i are the daily evaporation reduction coefficients dependent on the daily cumulative depth of evaporation de i from the surface layer on day i following complete wetting of the surface total evaporable water tew of the surface layer was calculated using the fc and wp values of the field site and was 20 mm the readily evaporable water rew was assumed as 9 mm for the sandy clay loam soil allen et al 1998 the kcmax i are the daily maximum values of kc i that can occur following ii or pi calculation of kcmax i requires values for daily minimum relative humidity and average wind speed provided by azmet and crop height hi which were increased from a minimum value of 0 05 m at the initial growth stage to a maximum of 1 2 m at mid season the increase of hi was in proportion to the increase in kcb i the few i values are the daily fractions of soil both wetted and exposed the few i are determined from estimates of daily covered soil fraction fc i and fraction of soil wetted fw i by ii or pi the fc i were increased from a minimum value of 0 0 at the initial stage of growth to 0 98 at mid season in proportion with the increase in kcb i when irrigation occurred a constant fw i value of 0 05 was used based on manually observed surface soil wetting during irrigations however the fw i were increased to 1 0 for any day when pi i was greater than 5 mm even though irrigation may have occurred on the same day after the crop establishment irrigations the swb eq 3 calculated dp losses of 14 0 and 4 mm for the remainder of the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively the 70 irrigation treatment was given 70 of the 100 irrigation amount starting on may 25 may 16 and may 2 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively irrigation was terminated in all plots on aug 23 aug 27 and aug 11 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 2 4 supporting field measurements volumetric soil water content θv was measured using two neutron probes nps cpn 503 instrotek co concord ca usa and a portable time domain reflectometer tdr minitrase soil moisture inc santa barbara ca usa two np access tubes were installed in each plot in late april 2016 and 2017 and mid april 2018 the access tubes 2 1 m long by 50 mm in diameter were installed vertically in a central row denoted as row 4 at a lateral distance of 0 10 m from the drip tape line the two tube locations in the plots were 40 m apart with one placed at either 20 or 40 m downstream of the drip tape water entry point at the east end and the other at 60 and 80 m further downstream respectively fig 1 the neutron probe measured θv from 0 1 to 1 9 m in 0 2 m increments using a depth control stand prescribed by evett et al 2008 two tdr measurements of θv were made for the soil surface 0 0 15 m at locations directly east and west of each access tube the tdr measurements were made at a distance of 0 5 m from the access tubes the nps and tdr were calibrated for the soil in a previous year hunsaker et al 2007 using gravimetric soil moisture samples obtained with a madera bulk density sampler following procedures similar to allen et al 1993 and evett and steiner 1995 the calibrations used in the present study were also confirmed with subsequent gravimetric moisture data and instrument readings made at the site two years after the first calibration soil samples were obtained from depths of 0 0 9 m in 0 15 m increments for both the initial calibration and subsequent testing the np and tdr measurements were taken for all plots at six to 11 day intervals in 2016 and 2018 and at six to 14 day intervals in 2017 starting on may 02 may 01 and april 13 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the measurements continued until shortly before cotton was chemically defoliated between late aug and mid sept depending on the year measurements of θv were not used in irrigation scheduling section 2 3 but were used to calculate actual cotton et as described next in section 2 5 on the same days θv was measured measurements of canopy height h were made near each np access tube location also canopy widths were measured at the same locations to estimate fraction of soil covered by vegetation fc at first open boll in each year aboveground biomass was sampled at four 0 5 m long sections of two rows rows 5 and 6 where lengths of sections were centered at 20 40 60 and 80 m along the length of the plot the dates of sample were aug 2 aug 1 and july 16 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the first open boll sampling time was chosen because it is a time close to when cotton typically achieves maximum biomass and cover following this stage biomass starts to decrease as lower leaves of the plant begin to senesce following chemical defoliation cotton seed and lint were harvested with a two row cotton picker case 2155 case ih grand island ne usa on oct 7 2016 oct 27 2017 and nov 2 2018 the harvests were made in two central rows rows 4 and 5 at four 6 m long sections centered at 20 40 60 and 80 m along the length of each plot the harvested lint and seed were separated by a gin and weighed 2 5 observed cotton evapotranspiration and crop coefficients actual cotton et in the studies was calculated as the residual of the root zone swb eq 8 for periods bounded by two adjacent dates of θv measurements 8 etc act dr 2 dr 1 i p dp where etc act is the total actual et mm that occurred in the period from the first 1 to second 2 measurement date dr 1 and dr 2 are the measured root zone soil water depletion mm on the first and second date respectively the i p and dp respectively are total depth of measured irrigation mm total measured precipitation 1 0 mm per day and total deep percolation below the root zone mm that occurred during the period the θv was measured to a 1 9 m depth to allow adequate assessment of the crop water use extraction depth and detection of water percolating below that depth analysis of θv by depth and time showed that little soil water was depleted below 1 5 m thus etc act was calculated for a zr of 1 6 m i e using neutron probe readings down to 1 5 m and assuming sphere of influence or effective radius of np readings was 0 10 m however there was occasionally a slight increase in θv below the 1 5 m depth at some locations from one measurement date to the next on occasions when an increase in θv measured at 1 7 and 1 9 m was greater than 1 0 mm i e on a depth basis from the first to second date that amount was input as dp in eq 8 the etc act calculations were made separately for each of the two np access tube locations within a plot with three replications gave six locations per irrigation treatment using the θv data at the given tube location for dr in eq 8 however the same total measured i to a given plot was used in eq 8 for the two locations in the plot the p amounts 1 0 mm d 1 provided by the azmet weather station were added in eq 8 for all locations in each of the years field capacity i e when dr zero was estimated separately for each location the first θv measurements were not made until 21 21 and 12 days after planting in the 2016 2017 and 2018 years respectively therefore the fc for a np location was estimated by assuming the given location s dr at the first θv measurement date in a year was equal to the dr at that date as calculated by the irrigation scheduling model described in section 2 3 thus at the first θv measurement in each year all locations for both 100 and 70 irrigation treatments were assumed to start at the same estimated dr which were 16 8 10 2 and 1 6 mm for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 gives the average estimated fc for each plot replicate by irrigation treatment in all three years for example if the starting dr was 16 8 mm 2016 and the first θv measurements of the crop root zone calculated stored water to be 396 mm then at fc stored water would be 412 8 mm or an average soil water content of 0 258 m3 m 3 it was also assumed that available water holding capacity was the same at all locations and years i e 128 mm m 1 a field average value as referred to earlier the components of the swb in eq 8 were evaluated on a seasonal basis for the two treatments in each year each swb component was statistically analyzed using proc mixed sas 2013 to determine treatment differences in these analyses irrigation treatment was considered a fixed effect while replicate and replicate by irrigation were considered random effects actual single kc kc act and basal kcb kcb act values were derived for each period using the total etc act determined by eq 8 for this a daily swb of the root zone similar to eq 3 was calculated for each neutron tube location starting on the first and ending on the last θv measurement date in each year in the swb the total etc act for each period was modeled as daily actual et etc act i whose sum was required to be equal to the total etc act in the period but whose values varied according to daily eto estimated daily soil water stress and daily soil evaporation the etc act i values in each period were found by iteration of the fao56 dual kc calculations until daily values of ks i kcb act ke i eto i summed to total etc act in the period eq 9 9 et cact i 1 j k s i k cbact k e i et o i i 1 j et cact i where etc act is the total mm for all days from 1 to j in a given period determined by eq 8 kcb act is a uniform single value basal crop coefficient for each day i to j in a given period ks i is the water stress coefficient on day i ke i is the soil evaporation coefficient on day i eto i is the pm eto mm on day i and etc act i is daily actual crop et mm on day i the ke i were determined using the fao56 dual kc procedures which included a separate daily swb of the surface soil layer 0 10 m and use of the governing ke i equation above in eq 7 for all locations the ke soil parameters rew 9 mm and tew 20 mm and the wetted soil fraction fw were the same as those described in the irrigation scheduling section 2 3 however the daily values of h and fc that are also used in computing daily ke were based on the measured h and fc for each location interpolated to daily values thus the parameters used to calculate ke i in eq 7 were often variable for the np tube locations daily values for ks i were computed using eqs 4 and 6 the p values used for calculating ks i for 100 locations were adjusted daily using the fao56 numerical approximation allen et al 1998 for days when etc act i differed from 5 0 mm d 1 10 pi pcotton 0 04 5 etc act i where pi is the daily value and pcotton is the p value for cotton of 0 65 when etc act i is equal to 5 0 mm d 1 as given in fao56 the average daily etc reported for well watered cotton at maricopa are on the order of 6 5 7 0 mm d 1 but rates often exceed 12 0 mm d 1 during summer months hunsaker 1999 hunsaker et al 2005 2015 thus for the hot dry weather conditions and high etc rates at this location water stress can reduce actual etc of the 100 irrigation treatment locations to some extent even though the estimated swd 30 and modeled daily ks was computed 1 0 except for a few days at the end of the season in contrast in the ks i analysis of the 70 irrigation treatment locations in each year eq 10 was used but the pcotton value was varied systematically in 0 025 increments from 0 60 to 0 70 this analysis was performed to calibrate the pcotton value and thereby the computed ks i values that best agreed with the reduction in measured etc act for the 70 treatment in this analysis the average daily ks i computed for each period was compared to the ratio of the average measured etc act of the 70 to the 100 irrigation treatment best agreement was obtained when linear correlation of the computed average ks i versus the measured etc act ratio for all periods in the year achieved the highest positive correlation coefficient r the method used was the pearson r performed with sigmaplot systat software san jose ca daily actual kc kc act i values were computed as the summation of kcb act x ks i ke i in eq 9 the average of the kc act i values for each period was exactly equal to the summation of etc act i in the period divided by the summation of the eto i in the period when the ks i was calculated as 1 0 for all days in the period when one or more days in a period had ks i less than 1 0 then the average of the kc act i values was higher than summed etc act i summed eto i for those periods treatment means of average kc act i data for periods were evaluated as a function of days after planting dap the mean of the average kc act i data of the 100 treatments for the periods in each year were used to construct daily fao56 segmented kc act curves the curves in each year were based on growth stage durations that best approximated the trends in the mean kc act i data upon establishing the four growth stage durations in each year the kc act values for the horizontal segments of the initial and mid season growth stages were determined by averaging the mean kc act i data for all periods that were within those stages respectively the end of season kc act value used for constructing the daily curve for the late season stage was the mean of the final kc act i determined in each year just before cotton termination an fao56 segmented kcb act curve was developed in a similar manner for each year with the 100 treatment mean kcb act i data determined for periods in the analyses for transferability of the observed crop coefficients at this arid site the mid season kc act and kcb act values of the derived fao56 curves for each year were also adjusted to represent the standard climate conditions proposed in fao56 where minimum relative humidity rhmin 45 and wind speed at 2 m above the ground surface u2 2 m s 1 the adjustments were made using the transfer equations provided in pereira et al 2020 3 results 3 1 weather during the three cotton

growth periods of april and may were generally higher in 2017 and 2018 than in 2016 however during june the mean tmax and tmin were 1 5 and 2 0 c cooler in 2018 than in june 2017 and 2016 respectively during the months of june and july daily tmax 43 4 c occurred 20 14 and 7 times in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 tmax 43 4 c occurred for nine consecutive days from june 18 26 including four days during that period with tmax 46 5 c in 2016 and 2018 temperatures above 46 5 c occurred only on one day in each season however mean cotton growing degree day gdd for june computed by the azmet station at mac does not reflect the higher daily tmax in 2017 due to an upper threshold temperature limit of 30 0 c used in computing gdd https cals arizona edu azmet monthly mean eto in june 2017 was

yield planting dates for the three years were within ten calendar days of each other with the earliest planting on april 2 in 2018 table 3 in each year chemical defoliants were applied when the cotton bolls in the 100 irrigation treatments were more than 90 open giving season lengths of 148 164 and 149 days for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 some vegetative regrowth occurred in late aug slowing boll opening in that year by about two weeks compared to the other years because the season was longer in 2017 cumulative eto was also higher than the other years table 3 however on a daily basis average eto was essentially the same in all years 7 8 7 9 mm d 1 total irrigation applied from planting through defoliation for the 100 treatments ranged from 904 mm in 2016 to 1057 mm in 2017 where establishment irrigation was about 100 mm more in 2017 than 2016 the 70 irrigation treatment received between 74 and 77 of total irrigation applied to the 100 treatment in the three years measured mean swd expressed as a percentage of taw eq 5 is shown for the two irrigation treatments on a timescale of days after planting dap with day one being the planting date in fig 2 the measured mean swd during the first 60 dap for the two treatments fluctuated from 5 to 32 in 2016 4 29 in 2017 and 1 6 19 in 2018 indicating ample available soil water for both irrigation treatments to that point in all years measured mean swd for the 100 treatments increased with time after 60 dap to values 35 or above on 98 91 and 92 dap in 2016 2017 and 2018 fig 2a b and c respectively mean swd for 100 treatments remained below 40 until late in each year when they increased to values of 44 and higher starting on 126 140 and 128 dap in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the effects of accumulated irrigation deficits for 70 irrigation treatments resulted in mean swd becoming more than 10 higher than that for 100 treatments starting at 56 dap in 2016 fig 2a 71 dap in 2017 fig 2b and 68 dap in 2018 fig 2c the differences in treatment swd then generally widened in all years until 84 dap in 2016 133 dap in 2017 and 106 dap in 2018 at those measurement dates mean swd for the 100 and 70 treatments were 28 and 53 31 and 62 and 27 and 56 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the time periods associated with the biggest differences in mean swd values between the 70 and 100 treatments i e when mean swd for 70 treatments exceeded mean swd for 100 treatments by 20 or more were not the same in the three years in 2016 the time period was from 70 to 98 dap where mean swd averaged 50 versus 27 for the 100 treatment however the differences were more extensive and for a longer duration in 2017 from 108 to 140 dap in 2017 averages of 63 and 36 for the 70 and 100 and less extensive and for a shorter duration in 2018 from 100 to 114 dap in 2018 59 versus 35 respectively during mid season or 75 125 dap mean swd for the 70 treatment averaged 54 55 and 55 respectively while mean swd for 100 for that period averaged 34 35 and 35 respectively in 2016 2017 and 2018 standard deviation bars about the means indicated variation of swd was generally greater within the 100 treatment compared to the 70 treatment fig 2 biomass for the 100 treatments decreased from a high of 14 9 mg ha 1 in 2016 12 4 mg ha 1 in 2018 table 3 however lint yields increased from 1470 kg ha 1 in 2016 1780 kg ha 1 and 2200 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively according to bronson et al 2019 both biomass and lint yield were significantly higher for the 100 than the 70 treatment in each year notably lint yield for the 70 irrigation treatment in 2018 was much higher than the 70 treatment yields in the other years and remarkably the 70 treatment lint yield was also higher than the lint yields for the 100 treatments in 2016 and 2017 maximum measured mean crop height h and cover fraction fc for 100 treatments were 1 38 0 23 m and 0 95 0 03 in 2016 1 18 0 14 m and 0 96 0 04 in 2017 and 1 24 0 08 m and 0 99 0 02 in 2018 for 70 treatments the mean values were 0 98 0 07 m and 0 80 0 03 0 92 0 03 m and 0 81 0 07 and 1 01 0 03 m and 0 91 0 02 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 3 3 cotton evapotranspiration the observed mean etc act for each period from eq 8 is shown for treatments in the 2016 2017 and 2018 cotton years in tables 4 6 respectively the mean ratio of etc act of the 70 and 100 hereafter referred to as the etc act ratio was above 1 0 for measured periods in 2016 and 2018 prior to the start of differential irrigation amounts on may 25 44 dap and may 02 31 dap respectively in 2017 etc act ratios were less than 1 0 before differential irrigations commenced on may 15 35 dap though mean differences in etc act for the two treatments were less than 2 1 mm for those periods table 5 in all years etc act ratios began to decline after the 70 irrigation treatment was imposed indicating reduced etc act for 70 treatments by about 70 75 dap mid to late june the etc act ratio had declined to 0 79 0 80 in all years this time marks the approximate beginning of the mid season growth stage in the years measurements in subsequent periods through about 125 dap beginning of the late season stage showed etc act ratios as low as 0 65 66 in 2016 and 2018 but only 0 77 in 2017 however the mean cumulative etc act ratio was similar in all years 0 77 0 79 tables 4 6 mean daily etc act of the 100 treatments for the measured periods in tables 4 6 ranged from 1 5 to 12 1 mm d 1 2016 fig 3a 1 1 13 5 mm d 1 2017 fig 3b and 1 0 12 4 mm d 1 2018 fig 3c the highest mean daily etc act of the 70 treatments for all periods was 8 3 10 8 and 9 4 mm d 1 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 3 also shows the average daily irrigation rates for the 100 treatment and precipitation amounts 1 0 mm for each year mean cumulative etc act summed over all measurement periods tables 4 6 was higher by 31 and 77 mm for the 100 treatment in 2017 than in 2018 and 2016 respectively years in which the cotton season was about two weeks shorter and cumulative eto was about 110 mm less than in 2017 table 3 the differences in cumulative etc act between the 100 and 70 treatments were significant in each year table 7 where the 100 treatment cumulative etc act was about 215 mm higher in each year evaluation of the other seasonal soil water balance components indicated significant differences between the treatments in cumulative irrigation applied in each year and the change in soil water storage except in 2016 table 7 the mean cumulative dp calculated for 100 treatments was 4 5 6 9 and 6 0 mm and for the 70 treatments 1 2 0 0 and 1 5 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively significant differences in dp between treatments occurred in 2017 and 2018 but not 2016 table 7 the etc adj estimated for the irrigation scheduling over the same measurement periods agreed reasonably well with mean etc act of the 100 through about 40 50 dap in all years tables 4 6 and fig 3 in 2016 mean daily etc act of the 100 was markedly higher than etc adj 1 0 2 0 mm d 1 for periods from 50 to 70 dap and generally somewhat higher less than 0 9 mm d 1 through about 110 dap fig 3a during the late season in 2016 etc adj was higher particularly for the last period mean daily etc act of the 100 was markedly higher than etc adj 1 0 1 9 mm d 1 for periods from 57 to 77 dap in 2017 fig 3b after that differences in daily for etc act and etc adj were 0 6 mm d 1 or less until the last two periods in 2017 when etc adj was about 1 6 mm d 1 higher in 2018 daily etc act was consistently higher than etc adj in periods from 60 through 130 dap though the differences ranged from 0 3 to 1 6 mm d 1 fig 3c however the etc adj was much higher for the last period in 2018 similar to 2016 and 2017 cumulative etc adj was less than mean etc act for the 100 treatment by 6 18 and 56 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 tables 4 6 respectively 3 4 soil water stress fig 4 shows the mean etc act ratio for the periods in each year along with the calibrated best fit mean ks for the 70 treatment locations during the same periods the best r values between calibrated mean ks for the 70 treatment with the mean etc act ratio over the periods shown were with pcotton values within eq 10 of 0 60 in 2016 fig 4a 0 675 in 2017 fig 4b and 0 675 in 2018 fig 4c the r values were 0 95 0 72 and 0 81 for 2016 2017 2018 respectively measurement periods prior to those in fig 4 i e before 70 75 dap were not used in the correlation analysis since the daily mean ks for the 70 was computed as 1 0 prior to 70 75 dap regardless of the pcotton value used however the mean etc act ratio was considerably less than 1 0 in all years for periods prior to 70 75 dap as shown in tables 4 6 the agreement between calibrated mean ks and the mean etc act ratio was reasonable in all years between about 85 130 dap or the mid season growth stage agreement was generally less favorable during the late season when measured and calibrated data were more variable among locations than during mid season evaluation of the daily mean ks estimated for the 100 treatment assuming pcotton 0 65 suggested that minor water stress occurred for some days in each year fig 5 since the daily ks values in fig 5 are the means of the six locations in the treatment a mean daily ks less than 1 0 on a day indicates root zone depletion exceeded the readily available soil water at one or more locations the estimated mean daily ks for the 100 treatment in each year dropped to the lowest value of 0 95 on 107 dap in 2016 fig 5a 0 97 on 89 dap in 2017 fig 5b and 0 89 on 128 dap in 2018 fig 5c on those particular days the eto values were high 10 4 11 3 and 9 9 mm while the mean etc act of the 100 treatments were 12 0 1 5 12 9 0 7 and 11 5 0 5 mm and mean percent swd values were 42 4 4 7 37 7 6 8 and 48 9 6 7 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the corresponding mean p values on those days were 0 37 0 34 and 0 39 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively periods of several consecutive days in which estimated mean daily ks was less than 1 0 occurred for the 100 treatment from 102 to 111 dap average of daily mean ks 0 977 and from 123 to 126 dap 0 986 in 2016 and from 85 to 97 dap 0 987 in 2017 in 2018 estimated mean daily ks 1 for consecutive days was very infrequent although there was a short period late in the 2018 from 126 to 128 dap when the average mean daily ks was 0 944 although occasional water stress reduction as indicated by days when mean daily ks 1 may have slightly reduced daily etc act for 100 treatments the etc act ratios shown in fig 4 would be only minimally changed had there been no water stress in the 100 treatments mean daily ks for the 70 treatments using the calibrated pcotton values did not fall below 1 0 in the three years until 72 74 dap fig 5 in 2016 lower mean daily ks occurred from 85 to 110 dap early to late july than at other times in the season fig 5a mean daily ks ranged from 0 654 to 0 894 and averaged 0 765 between 85 and 110 dap in 2016 a 35 day time period that corresponded to the highest swd 53 58 for the 70 treatment until late in the 2016 season fig 2a in 2017 fig 5b mean daily ks for the 70 treatments declined earlier than in 2016 where mean daily ks in 2017 averaged 0 909 between 72 and 84 dap compared to an average of 0 978 during the same period in 2016 however between 85 and 110 dap in 2017 mean daily ks were generally not as low averaging 0 806 than the mean daily ks during the same period 35 day period in 2016 although swd was similar for the 70 treatments during that period in both years fig 2 conversely in 2017 during the time period when mean swd differences between the 70 and 100 treatments were the greatest i e 108 140 dap fig 2 mean daily ks averaged 0 791 compared to a much higher mean daily ks average of 0 934 for the same period in 2016 when swd differences between irrigation treatments were smaller in 2018 from 85 to 100 dap mean daily ks for the 70 treatment varied from 0 594 to 1 0 and averaged 0 764 over the period similar to that in 2016 for the same period the lowest mean daily ks in 2018 corresponded to a time period when the mean swd for the 70 treatment was about 62 110 130 dap in that period the average mean daily ks of the 70 treatment was 0 708 and swd for the 100 treatment was 44 3 5 crop coefficients the observed mean kc act of the 100 irrigation treatments for the measured periods are shown with dap in fig 6 a c for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in all years the kc act and kcb act data increased in a near linear manner from the initial stage through the development stage the kc act data for periods during the initial stage were sparse however since neutron tubes were not installed until about halfway into that stage during periods at mid season in 2017 and 2018 kc act values did not fluctuate appreciably and therefore generally followed the horizontal trend proposed by fao56 for that growth stage in 2016 however the kc act data did not show a clear plateau at mid season but showed a curvilinear trend from beginning to end of the mid season stage with a kc act peak at 102 dap the late season stages were short and kc act data points during late season were also scant especially in 2016 and 2018 when the intervals between θv measurements were longer than those through mid season the agreement between the constructed kc act curve with the kc act data is very good in 2017 and 2018 except during the late season when actual data for comparison of the curve was limited the daily kc act curve constructed in 2016 tends to underestimate the kc act data during the development stage as well as overestimate kc act data during early and late portions of the mid season stage the differences between the kc act and kcb act data and curves indicate the estimated evaporation during the years fig 6 for measured data in each year the kc act ranged between 0 0 and 0 06 higher than kcb act during the mid season stage this difference was 0 06 0 05 and 0 04 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the growth stage parameters used in constructing the daily kc act and kcb act curves are shown in table 8 the lengths of the initial and development stages were similar in all years where the number of days from planting through development varied by four days or less average growth lengths for the three years were 33 1 2 days and 42 3 1 days for the initial and development stages respectively table 8 cumulative growing degree days cgdd for growth stages also shown in table 8 were similar among the years during the initial stage though cgdd was somewhat higher during the development stage in 2016 due primarily to more days in that stage than in other years the mid season stage length was the longest in 2017 55 days followed by 52 and 45 days in 2018 and 2016 respectively the average mid season length for years was 51 5 1 days the cgdd during the mid season stage for the years increased with the number of days in that stage the late season length averaged for the years was 28 5 3 the 2017 late season was notably longer 8 10 days than in the other years total cggd was about 255 d greater in 2017 than 2016 and 2018 for the three years the average season length was 154 9 0 days corresponding to a yearly average of total cgdd of 2100 148 d table 8 the mean kc act and kcb act values of the 100 irrigation treatment for the initial and mid season stages and the end of season values used in the daily curves are shown in table 9 for each year the kc act and kcb act values for the initial stage reflect only the latter half of that stage when irrigation was infrequent and precipitation was negligible therefore the observed kc act and estimated kcb act for this part of the initial stage were similar in all years 0 21 0 22 on average the average observed mid season kc act for the three years table 9 was highest in 2018 1 34 and lowest in 2017 1 28 in contrast the estimated mid season kc adj with an assumed 1 2 mid season kcb used in the irrigation scheduling was lower than the observed averaging 1 26 in all years the average observed mid season kc act values for each year were adjusted to represent the standard climate conditions proposed in fao56 where rhmin 45 and u2 2 m s 1 these adjustments resulted in mid season kc act of 1 20 1 25 over the three years with an average of 1 22 table 9 the estimated average kcb act at mid season were lower by 0 04 0 06 than the kc act in the years table 9 when adjusted to the standard climate the estimated mid season kcb act vary from 1 15 to 1 21 over the three years with an average of 1 17 in each year the end of season kc act and kcb act values were the same because during the last measurement period the surface layer soil water was completely depleted and no soil evaporation occurred the end season kcb act values for the three years ranged between 0 29 and 0 48 and averaged 0 37 table 9 the lower end of season kcb act values observed in 2016 and 2017 than in 2018 were possibly due to higher swd at the end season in those years than in 2018 fig 2 4 discussion the lint yield of the 100 treatment in 2016 was lower than the 2016 state average upland cotton lint yield for arizona of 1710 kg ha 1 usda nass 2019 tables 2 3 in contrast lint yields for 100 treatments were 10 higher than the state average yield in 2017 1640 kg ha 1 and 50 higher than the state average yield in 2018 1480 kg ha 1 the lower lint yield in 2016 was associated with several consecutive days of severe heat stress during the squaring stage early june resulting in small squares dropping bronson et al 2019 also total water applied including precipitation was 170 and 100 mm less in 2016 than in 2017 and 2018 respectively the high lint yield in 2018 compared to the two other years may have been attributed to the earlier planting date which led to more moderate temperatures during squaring and flowering periods also during boll ripening in the late season the 2018 climate was milder and had higher humidity than in the other years and had several significant p events consistently the lint yield was much higher for the 70 irrigation treatment in 2018 compared to other years in 2018 70 treatment plants were slightly taller and achieved greater plant cover than in other years the reduction of lint yield for the 70 treatment than that of the 100 treatment was 15 16 in 2016 and 2018 but it was 36 in 2017 the 70 treatment in 2017 suffered earlier onset of water stress than the 70 treatment in other years likely due to the extreme high temperatures and eto rates 10 mm d 1 that occurred in late june 72 77 dap of that year when the crop was well into flowering the earlier water stress for the 70 in 2017 than in other years is also supported by the lower etc act ratios during the first 80 dap in 2017 while swd values for the 70 treatments were similar during the mid season in all years the swd values for the 70 treatment in 2017 differed more extensively relative to the swd of the 100 than in other years also consistent with the greater yield reduction for the 70 in 2017 radin et al 1992 stated that soil water deficit effects on cotton yield are most pronounced when the deficits occur during peak fruiting typically 75 95 dap in arizona when full irrigation of cotton cannot be met doorenbos and kassam 1979 maintained that water deficits should be distributed to vegetative and ripening periods but that water stress during flowering should be avoided however de kock et al 1990 indicated that when water is limited preference should be given for irrigation during boll development followed by early flowering and then peak flowering however loka et al 2011 pointed out that the most sensitive water stress period in relation to yield is not clearly understood loka et al 2011 concluded that water stress effects on yield depend not only on the timing of stress but also on the extent of stress as well as the way stress occurs e g sudden versus gradual as stated the greater yield reduction for the 70 treatment relative to the 100 in 2017 than other years appears to be related to the earlier water deficits during flowering in that year as well the more extensive differences in swd between the two treatments during the boll development phase the cumulative etc act for the 100 treatment in the three years were higher than the estimated cumulative etc adj which used the hunsaker et al 2005 crop coefficients and growth stage lengths for the 100 irrigation treatment scheduling generally etc act rates for the 100 treatment were substantially higher than the etc adj rates starting in the development stage and continuing through the mid season growth stage in each year conversely etc adj were higher than observed in the three years during the late season although the lengths of the growth stages in the present study were consistent to those of hunsaker et al 2005 for the initial mid season and late season stages the lengths of the development stages in the present study were considerably shorter 42 3 1 days versus 51 days the etc act and etc adj during the initial stage were similar corresponding to the close agreement between observed kcb act 0 21 3 year average with the 0 15 kcb value assumed in the estimation model however the higher mid season kcb act and shorter development stage observed in the present study compared to the hunsaker et al 2005 data were a consequence of the higher etc act rates than those estimated starting in the development stage this trend of higher observed than estimated et was associated with gradually increasing swd for the 100 treatment starting in the development stage of each year soil water content measurements indicated deep percolation loss was minimal although the 100 treatments were essentially irrigated daily during these growth stages modeled daily ks indicated that slight water stress may have occasionally occurred due to underestimated et and irrigation requirement the higher etc adj than observed rates that occurred during the late season stages where attributed to the estimated end of season kcb value used 0 51 that was higher than the observed 0 37 3 year average in this situation the end of season etc act for sdi treatments was low due to early termination of irrigation in the late season which led to heightened root zone swd and no occurrence of soil evaporation at the end of the season period the results from the present study having near daily sdi during mid season indicate higher mid season kcb act values occurred compared to those previously reported using surface and sprinkler irrigation at this same location hunsaker et al 2005 2016 thorp et al 2017 reasonably assuming that the total pm eto in maricopa during the cotton mid season stage is approximately equal among years the kcb act results in the present study suggest daily cotton etc rates may vary upwards by 2 10 when using sdi versus surface and sprinkler irrigation higher etc rates for sdi than for surface irrigation is contrary to the general premise that sdi should decrease etc because less evaporation occurs while transpiration does not change however a detailed analysis of crop et under different irrigation methods in california usa by burt et al 2002 also showed that for a wide variety of crops sdi tends to increase etc by 6 10 over the etc using surface and sprinkler irrigation methods ayars et al 1999 colaizzi et al 2004 2010 reported irrigation method comparison studies for a number of crops that consistently show equal or higher cumulative etc but lower soil evaporation using sdi than surface and sprinkler irrigation methods this suggests the hypothesis that when evaporation is reduced in sdi application a gain in plant available water for transpiration is realized evett et al 1995 rosa et al 2012 when deficit irrigation is practiced lamm et al 2012 note that sdi more effectively stabilizes crop yields than when other irrigation methods are used observed cotton mid season kc and kcb values can vary widely with climatic conditions as shown in pereira et al 2020 in this arid climate the local mid season values using sdi were higher than the fao56 maximum standard climate values of 1 2 and 1 15 for mid season kc and kcb respectively however in all years the mid season kc kcb values 0 08 0 15 higher than fao56 were below the maximum limit of 0 20 allen et al 1998 as pointed out by allen et al 2011 and more recently pereira et al 2020 the upper limit of kc based on the grass reference eto may be as high as 1 4 for tall well watered crops in arid and semiarid climates exceptionally high kc values are generally associated with strong regional advection allen et al 2011 the highest observed kc act for any 6 14 day period in the 3 year sdi study was 1 43 in late july 2018 the observed mid season kc act and kcb act values after adjustment to standard climate averaged 1 22 0 03 and 1 17 0 04 respectively which are each 0 02 higher than the standard fao56 mid season values despite analysis indicating that minor water stress may have occasionally occurred in the well watered treatment the crop management and agronomic conditions of the cotton were otherwise quite optimal since the crop coefficient data were corrected for the minor water stress through the use of modeled daily ks the coefficient values presented are deemed entirely adequate for meeting the standard condition addressed in fao56 and thus transferable pereira et al 2020 in each year the end of season kc act and kcb act values were the same since no e occurred the recommended end of season kcb for cotton in fao56 is a range from 0 40 to 0 50 pereira et al 2020 in their update proposed 0 40 for end of season cotton in the present study sdi the end of season kcb act averaged just 0 03 lower than 0 40 therefore the end of season kcb act value of 0 40 should be used for sdi management in the climate the analysis of etc act in the 70 deficit treatment indicated that the measured reduction as defined by the etc act ratio was well modeled during mid season by ks as computed using the fao56 dual procedures the daily ks values adjusted daily with the fao56 approximation equation fit the mid season etc act ratio best when pcotton was at 0 60 in 2016 and at 0 675 in 2017 and 2018 the lower pcotton value for 2016 was likely caused by more apparent stress in the 100 treatment in that year than other years nevertheless the 3 year average pcotton was 0 65 the same as in fao56 and rosa et al 2012 pereira et al 2020 however proposed the pcotton value be lowered to 0 60 during the development stage measured etc act ratios were less than 1 0 but ks computations did not reproduce the etc act reduction of the 70 treatment it is likely the reductions could have been reproduced if the actual depth of the crop root zone was known for the periods during development on the other hand differences in swd between the 100 and 70 were generally small during much of the development stage i e from 30 75 dap furthermore the measured swd for the 70 treatments during the development stage was generally 40 a depletion level well below the generally accepted threshold of 60 when water stress limits et for cotton jensen and allen 2016 5 conclusions actual etc etc act and yield of cotton were measured during a 3 year cotton experiment in arizona using sdi two irrigation treatments full 100 and deficit 70 both with optimum n management were evaluated cumulative etc act varied from 961 to 1039 mm for the 100 irrigation treatment in the three years and those for the 70 treatment 742 825 mm were 21 23 lower lint yields for the 100 treatment were considerably higher than arizona state average yields in two of the three years lint yield was significantly reduced for the 70 treatment in all years however the yield reduction increased from 15 to 16 36 in one of the years when water stress was more pronounced during the flowering period the observed mid season kc and kcb crop coefficients averaged 1 31 and 1 26 respectively which were higher than those reported at this location in other studies but consistent with the tabulated mid season cotton values for the fao56 standard climate the observed kcb and kc for the initial growth stage averaged 0 21 0 22 respectively and at the end of season both values averaged 0 37 which were similar to the fao56 values provided for those growth stages estimated cotton growth stage lengths of 33 42 51 and 28 for the initial development mid season and late season stages respectively are recommended for developing the fao56 kc or kcb curves when using sdi baseline values of the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p used in modeling the 70 treatment et reduction by the water stress coefficient ks were developed values for the years varied between 0 60 and 0 675 while the 3 year average was 0 65 which is also the recommended baseline p value for cotton in fao56 full irrigation of cotton in this arid climate requires an available water supply that meets the daily etc of cotton at mid season thus sdi systems will need to apply water at a rate of 11 13 mm d 1 starting in the latter portion of the development stage recommended soil water depletion for full irrigation should be between 20 30 to avoid water stress and yield reduction deficit irrigation management should avoid water stress until after peak flowering or after 80 days after planting declaration of competing

10067,water shortages are a continuing reality for today s irrigated agriculture especially in the arid us southwest where cotton gossypium hirsutum l is an important crop decreasing water availability in the region coupled with high cotton water requirements are inducing water conservation practices including adoption of subsurface drip irrigation sdi and deficit irrigation management a 3 year cotton study 2016 2017 and 2018 was conducted on a sandy loam soil using sdi at maricopa arizona usa the objectives were to determine the actual single kc act and basal kcb act crop coefficients corresponding growth stage lengths and water stress adjustment criterion for estimating crop evapotranspiration etc by the widely used fao56 crop coefficient procedures treatments evaluated were full irrigation 100 and deficit irrigation 70 both replicated three times and managed at an optimum n rate irrigation scheduling was based on a fao56 kcb curve locally developed in earlier studies at the maricopa location using furrow irrigation actual etc etc act was determined by a soil water balance using 0 1 9 m soil profile water content measurements made every 6 14 days the study also quantified the effects on etc act and yield due to the deficit irrigation treatment etc act rates were high for the 100 treatment often exceeding 12 0 mm d 1 during the mid season stage in all years cumulative etc act for the 100 treatment was 961 1039 and 1008 mm and lint yield was 1470 1780 and 2200 kg ha 1 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively treatment effects on both etc act and cotton yield were significant in all years cumulative etc act for the 70 treatment was 21 23 less than that for the 100 in each year lint yields for the 70 treatments were reduced 15 16 in two of the years and by 36 in 2017 when soil water stress occurred earlier in the growing season the 3 year average values of kc act and kcb act at mid season were 1 31 and 1 26 respectively though higher than those previously reported for cotton at this location these mid season values are considered appropriate in this arid climate when using sdi and were consistent with the fao56 mid season standard cotton values after local climate adjustment the observed average kc act and kcb act during the initial stage were 0 21 and they were 0 37 at the end of season closely agreeing with the fao56 tabulated cotton values for those stages the average growth stage lengths determined for the sdi cotton are 33 42 51 and 28 for the initial development mid season and late season stages respectively the fao56 water stress coefficient ks was modeled for the 70 treatment using five different baseline values of depletion fraction for no stress p that varied from 0 60 to 0 70 in 0 025 increments best correlation coefficients r between the etc act ratio of the 70 and 100 treatments with the modeled ks of the 70 treatment were obtained with baseline p values of 0 60 0 675 and 0 675 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the three 3 year average baseline p value of 0 65 which is the same baseline p value for cotton in fao56 is recommended for estimating etc reduction due to water stress keywords crop evapotranspiration soil water depletion grass reference evapotranspiration soil evaporation lint yield 1 introduction during the past 22 years the crop coefficient kc method of the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 fao56 allen et al 1998 has become a widely adopted technology for estimating evapotranspiration et and crop water requirements pereira et al 2015 2020 the kc is the ratio of the et rate of the crop and the et rate of a reference vegetated surface usually calculated on a daily basis the fao56 kc method is founded on a short grass reference crop whose et rate denoted as eto is determined with daily weather data applied in the standardized penman monteith pm calculations provided in fao56 the fao56 paper distinguishes between the rate of crop et grown under standard conditions etc and that for actual conditions etc act standard conditions refer to crops grown under optimum soil water nutrient and pest management are disease free and achieve full production for the given climate allen et al 1998 if any of these conditions fall short then the usage of etc act is preferred the fao56 method calculates daily etc for a given crop as the kc times the daily pm eto however fao56 includes procedures for the more comprehensive dual kc method where daily etc is calculated by separating the single kc into two coefficients the basal crop coefficient kcb to estimate crop transpiration tc and the soil evaporation coefficient ke to estimate evaporation e as in eq 1 1 etc kcb ke eto when crops are grown in non standard conditions such as under soil water or salinity stress fao56 incorporates coefficients to adjust the standard condition etc denoted as etc adj for example when soil water conditions in the crop root zone drop below a given threshold the kcb is multiplied by the water stress coefficient ks 1 eq 2 thus adjusted tc due to water stress is decreased below the amount calculated under standard conditions when water stress does not occur ks 1 in eq 2 because e is combined with tc in the single kc fao56 suggests ks adjustment is generally more appropriate for the dual than single kc method 2 etc adj kskcb ke eto cotton gossypium hirsutum l is grown in many arid and semiarid lands worldwide including the southwestern united states usda nass 2019 tables 2 3 where annual crop water use requirements can be up to 1000 mm erie et al 1982 however water for irrigation has been dwindling due to the prolonged drought in the us southwest thompson et al 2009 castle et al 2014 ganjegunte and clark 2017 and in other arid and semiarid countries where cotton is produced such as india and australia mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 water shortages have prompted cotton growers to implement more efficient irrigation systems such as low energy sprinkler and drip irrigation thompson et al 2009 lamm et al 2012 goebel and lascano 2019 subsurface drip irrigation sdi systems where drip tape is installed below the soil surface are intended for multi year use lamm et al 2012 which is suitable for monoculture cotton as practiced in central arizona usa thompson et al 2009 lamm et al 2012 ayars et al 2015 summarized the advantages in adopting sdi over conventional surface irrigation methods in production of cotton and other crops namely water savings due to reduced evaporation runoff and deep percolation losses and enhanced growth higher yields and produce quality from better timing and placement of water and nutrients ayars et al 2015 reviewed a number of cotton studies in california usa that demonstrated significant yield increases and irrigation water use reductions using sdi over various surface irrigation methods although that review did not provide measurements of crop et for the cotton studies it is conceivable that the tc component of etc may have been higher in the cotton using sdi than in surface irrigation since soil evaporation is less with sdi currently cotton growers in areas such as the southern high plains of texas usa are using sdi systems for applying deficit irrigation a practice where the crop et demands are not fully met howell et al 2004 thompson et al 2009 goebel and lascano 2019 in these areas sufficient water for optimum cotton irrigation is generally not available lamm et al 2012 indicates sdi is used for deficit irrigation because it offers greater economic returns to growers compared to deficit irrigation with sprinklers analyses by castle et al 2014 and scanlon et al 2016 conclude that water allotments for us states such as arizona in the colorado river basin are overtaxed therefore growers in these western us states are now or will soon likely be forced to tolerate having less water than needed to fully irrigate crops this has generally not been an issue for arizona growers until recently information regarding cotton water use using deficit irrigation management in the hot arid climate of arizona is practically non existent appropriate mid season kc and kcb values are most critical in developing the fao56 segmented curves because these values ultimately affect etc estimation for the other growth stages fao56 proposed mid season cotton kc and kcb values for the standard climate of 1 15 1 2 and 1 10 1 15 respectively the standard coefficients are then adjusted in fao56 procedures for use in the local climate generally upward in arid and semi arid climates and downward in humid climates when cotton mid season kc and kcb values are derived with measurements at different climatic locations they can vary widely the review and update of fao56 crop coefficients pereira et al 2020 reported locally observed cotton mid season kc values for 13 recent worldwide studies that were considered to be conducted with optimum management and reliable measurement systems however after adjustment to standard climate the resulting values were found to be highly variable and generally inconsistent with the proposed fao56 mid season cotton kc i e kc varied from 0 88 to 1 22 with an average of 1 06 although pereira et al 2020 reported only six studies having locally observed cotton mid season kcb values the values when adjusted to the fao56 standard climate were more in line with the fao56 kcb and less variable 1 02 1 21 with an average of 1 12 albeit four of the six studies in the report were in arizona while the transferability of the standard fao56 coefficients is generally appropriate locally developed kcb values based on research studies can be more suitable as they more effectively reflect the actual local conditions cultural practices and crop varieties used allen et al 1998 however local modifications of the fao56 standard crop coefficients should not deviate by more than 0 20 allen et al 1998 hunsaker et al 2005 derived local mid season cotton kcb of 1 2 in studies using furrow irrigation in maricopa arizona later hunsaker et al 2015 found that the mid season cotton kcb was also about 1 2 in level basin irrigation experiments at the same maricopa location the mid season kcb were determined for cotton grown with overhead sprinkler irrigation at maricopa by thorp et al 2017 whose data indicated values were also on the order of 1 2 the mid season kcb in the studies when adjusted to the standard climate would be about 1 11 or towards the lower range of the cotton kcb proposed by fao56 i e 1 10 1 15 the hypotheses are that cotton crop coefficients and growth stage lengths in this desert climate are the same regardless of irrigation method however these suppositions have not yet been confirmed by research when cotton is grown by sdi the present paper analyzes crop et crop coefficients and growth stage lengths for cotton at the maricopa location using sdi the data were evaluated in a three year study conducted from 2016 to 2018 which included well watered and deficit irrigation treatments bronson et al 2019 the objectives were to determine the appropriate crop coefficient data and growth stage lengths for cotton grown using sdi another objective of the study was to determine the parameters used to model the water stress coefficient which can be used as a means to estimate the reduction in crop et when deficit irrigation is used 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site crop establishment and treatments cotton gossypium hirsutum l crops were grown with sdi in 2016 2017 and 2018 on a 1 2 ha field site at the maricopa agricultural center mac in maricopa arizona usa 33 067 degree n 111 97 degree w 360 m above sea level the location is within a hot arid low desert region of the us southwest where cotton is typically planted in april and harvested in sept nov historically rainfall during the cotton season at mac is 75 mm hunsaker et al 2015 the soil is a casa grande sandy loam sandy clay loam fine loamy mixed superactive hyperthermic typic natrargid bronson et al 2019 the field site soil profile has average sand silt and clay contents of 62 14 and 24 respectively average volumetric water content at field capacity fc and wilting point wp of 0 268 and 0 140 m3 m 3 respectively and an average available water holding capacity of 128 mm m 1 hunsaker et al 2019 in march of each cotton year pre plant soil samples to a depth of 1 8 m were collected at four locations in the center bed of 15 treatment plots each plot eight 1 02 m bed rows wide by 100 m long fig 1 soil was sampled in 0 3 m increments using a tractor mounted soil sampling unit the samples were oven dried at 60 c ground to 1 mm extracted with 1 m kcl and analyzed for nh4

15 m high raised beds in the 15 treatment plots following each cotton planting irrigation was applied to all plots during the succeeding 7 9 days to promote uniform crop establishment total irrigation applied for crop establishment was 92 195 and 143 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively final plant stands were consistently near 10 plants m 1 in all years bronson et al 2019 a cotton population considered optimum when grown on 1 02 m rows deltapine 2019 adams et al 2019 the cotton studies previously described by bronson et al 2019 were a randomized block design with five treatments and three replications fig 1 treatment assignments to plots remained the same for all three cotton years the study consisted of three n treatments denoted as soil test based stb n reflectance based ref n and zero n full details on the methodology used for the n treatments in these cotton studies were previously reported by bronson et al 2019 within the stb and zero n treatments were two treatments of irrigation full denoted as 100 irrigation and deficit denoted as 70 irrigation the ref n treatment was only at the 100 irrigation treatment although the study included five treatments for the present paper purpose only the six stb n treatment plots of fig 1 are considered since the treatment was managed at an optimum n rate thus the stb treatment plants were not n limited at any time during the seasons bronson et al 2019 after crop establishment irrigation scheduling described later in section 2 3 commenced for treatments on april 29 april 27 and april 27 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 2 2 subsurface drip irrigation system and fertigation a 15 station sdi system was used in the studies the sdi system was designed to provide metered water and n to the 15 individual plots the irrigation flow rate and totalized flow volume for each plot were monitored with flow meters and 103 kpa pressure reducers were in each plot s irrigation entry point drip irrigation tape was buried 0 22 m below each raised bed in 2016 new tape was installed in early 2017 and buried at 0 28 m below beds for the 2017 and 2018 cotton seasons the drip tape spaced at 1 02 m rows was placed beneath the center of each cotton bed to be near the plant roots emitter spacing was 0 5 m in 2016 and was 0 3 m in 2017 and 2018 flow rate per emitter was 1 1 l hr 1 in 2016 and 0 6 l hr 1 in 2017 and 2018 metered urea ammonium nitrate 32 n was fertigated through the irrigation lines in 24 events over approximately 40 days coinciding with the cotton pin head square date to the mid bloom date the fertigation periods were from may 25 to june 30 2016 may 15 to june 23 2017 and may 1 to june 8 2018 in season fertilizer applied to the optimum n treatments totaled 175 172 and 224 kg n ha 1 for the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively 2 3 irrigation scheduling irrigation scheduling of the 100 treatment in each year was based on a daily soil water balance swb model of the cotton rooting depth zr which estimated root zone depletion dr at the end of each day eq 3 3 dr i dr i 1 pi ii etc i dpi where dr i and dr i 1 are the root zone depletion mm at the end of day i and day i 1 respectively and pi ii etc i and dpi are amounts of precipitation net irrigation depth crop et and deep percolation respectively on day i all in units of mm the inputs for ii were average measured irrigation depths given to the 100 treatment replicates inputs of pi were provided by the university of arizona meteorological network azmet https cals arizona edu azmet weather station at mac located about 100 m from the field site daily values of total available water tawi of the daily rooting depth zr i were calculated as 4 tawi 1000 zr i fc wp where tawi is in mm zr i in m and fc and wp were 0 268 and 0 140 m3 m 3 respectively which were field average fc and wp values determined previously for the site hunsaker et al 2019 the limits for dr i in eq 3 were zero at fc and taw at wp the zr i were increased from an initial value of 0 40 m at planting to a maximum of 1 5 m at mid season increase of zr i was proportional to the increase in daily kcb kcb i whose estimation are described below initiation of the swb was on the day of planting where the initial dr i was assumed to be 50 mm in each year or the taw for an initial zr i of 0 40 m locally derived cotton kcb values and growth stage lengths by hunsaker et al 2005 were used to construct an fao56 segmented daily kcb i curve that was used for irrigation scheduling in all three years the kcb for the initial growth stage kcb ini used in the curve was 0 15 as recommended for cotton in fao56 the mid season kcb kcb mid value was 1 20 and the end of season kcb kcb end value was 0 51 the durations used for the initial development mid season and late season growth stages were 31 51 50 and 23 days respectively for an expected 155 day cotton season it is noted that the local kcb and growth stage data used in the sdi study for irrigation scheduling were derived under furrow irrigation the estimated etc i for the swb of eq 3 were calculated using the fao56 dual crop coefficient procedures allen et al 1998 which include adjustment calculations to reduce etc i due to the effects of soil water stress thus estimated etc i for eq 3 were the daily adjusted values etc i adj according to eq 2 which includes the ks coefficient calculation equations for determining daily ks ks i are described below in brief ks i vary from zero to 1 0 and depend on the dr i and the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p allen et al 1998 when the calculated ks i is 1 0 etc i adj is equal to etc i if ks i is less than 1 0 etc i adj etc i daily pm eto and weather data that are used in calculating eq 2 were provided by the azmet station at mac the 100 irrigation treatment was managed to replace etc i adj with i and or p while maintaining the swb such that the daily soil water depletion swdi eq 5 30 5 swdi 100 x 1 tawi dr i tawi where swdi is in percent and tawi and dr i are as previously defined a daily water stress coefficient ks i was calculated by eq 6 6 ks i tawi dr i 1 pi tawi where ks i tawi and dr i are as previously defined and pi is the fraction of tawi that can be extracted from the root zone without suffering water stress the pi values were adjusted daily from a baseline value of 0 65 recommended for cotton in fao56 for days when estimated etc i adj was equal to 5 0 mm d 1 to pi 0 65 0 04 5 etc i adj on days when etc i adj differed from 5 0 mm d 1 for scheduling purposes if a ks i on a given day i was estimated to be less than 1 0 in the swb model then the ks i on day i was applied to reduce etc i on the next day i 1 this resulted in etc i adj less than etc i on day i 1 however in keeping the modeled swdi to less than 30 for the 100 treatment the daily ks i were always computed as 1 0 except for seven and three days well after irrigation had been terminated 2016 and 2017 respectively estimated ks i was never less than 1 0 for the entire 2018 cotton year daily values of ke ke i were estimated following irrigation or precipitation by computing eq 7 fao56 eq 71 which requires a daily swb of the surface soil layer here assumed as 0 1 m in thickness 7 ke i min kr i kcmax i kcb i few i x kcmax i the kr i are the daily evaporation reduction coefficients dependent on the daily cumulative depth of evaporation de i from the surface layer on day i following complete wetting of the surface total evaporable water tew of the surface layer was calculated using the fc and wp values of the field site and was 20 mm the readily evaporable water rew was assumed as 9 mm for the sandy clay loam soil allen et al 1998 the kcmax i are the daily maximum values of kc i that can occur following ii or pi calculation of kcmax i requires values for daily minimum relative humidity and average wind speed provided by azmet and crop height hi which were increased from a minimum value of 0 05 m at the initial growth stage to a maximum of 1 2 m at mid season the increase of hi was in proportion to the increase in kcb i the few i values are the daily fractions of soil both wetted and exposed the few i are determined from estimates of daily covered soil fraction fc i and fraction of soil wetted fw i by ii or pi the fc i were increased from a minimum value of 0 0 at the initial stage of growth to 0 98 at mid season in proportion with the increase in kcb i when irrigation occurred a constant fw i value of 0 05 was used based on manually observed surface soil wetting during irrigations however the fw i were increased to 1 0 for any day when pi i was greater than 5 mm even though irrigation may have occurred on the same day after the crop establishment irrigations the swb eq 3 calculated dp losses of 14 0 and 4 mm for the remainder of the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively the 70 irrigation treatment was given 70 of the 100 irrigation amount starting on may 25 may 16 and may 2 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively irrigation was terminated in all plots on aug 23 aug 27 and aug 11 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 2 4 supporting field measurements volumetric soil water content θv was measured using two neutron probes nps cpn 503 instrotek co concord ca usa and a portable time domain reflectometer tdr minitrase soil moisture inc santa barbara ca usa two np access tubes were installed in each plot in late april 2016 and 2017 and mid april 2018 the access tubes 2 1 m long by 50 mm in diameter were installed vertically in a central row denoted as row 4 at a lateral distance of 0 10 m from the drip tape line the two tube locations in the plots were 40 m apart with one placed at either 20 or 40 m downstream of the drip tape water entry point at the east end and the other at 60 and 80 m further downstream respectively fig 1 the neutron probe measured θv from 0 1 to 1 9 m in 0 2 m increments using a depth control stand prescribed by evett et al 2008 two tdr measurements of θv were made for the soil surface 0 0 15 m at locations directly east and west of each access tube the tdr measurements were made at a distance of 0 5 m from the access tubes the nps and tdr were calibrated for the soil in a previous year hunsaker et al 2007 using gravimetric soil moisture samples obtained with a madera bulk density sampler following procedures similar to allen et al 1993 and evett and steiner 1995 the calibrations used in the present study were also confirmed with subsequent gravimetric moisture data and instrument readings made at the site two years after the first calibration soil samples were obtained from depths of 0 0 9 m in 0 15 m increments for both the initial calibration and subsequent testing the np and tdr measurements were taken for all plots at six to 11 day intervals in 2016 and 2018 and at six to 14 day intervals in 2017 starting on may 02 may 01 and april 13 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the measurements continued until shortly before cotton was chemically defoliated between late aug and mid sept depending on the year measurements of θv were not used in irrigation scheduling section 2 3 but were used to calculate actual cotton et as described next in section 2 5 on the same days θv was measured measurements of canopy height h were made near each np access tube location also canopy widths were measured at the same locations to estimate fraction of soil covered by vegetation fc at first open boll in each year aboveground biomass was sampled at four 0 5 m long sections of two rows rows 5 and 6 where lengths of sections were centered at 20 40 60 and 80 m along the length of the plot the dates of sample were aug 2 aug 1 and july 16 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the first open boll sampling time was chosen because it is a time close to when cotton typically achieves maximum biomass and cover following this stage biomass starts to decrease as lower leaves of the plant begin to senesce following chemical defoliation cotton seed and lint were harvested with a two row cotton picker case 2155 case ih grand island ne usa on oct 7 2016 oct 27 2017 and nov 2 2018 the harvests were made in two central rows rows 4 and 5 at four 6 m long sections centered at 20 40 60 and 80 m along the length of each plot the harvested lint and seed were separated by a gin and weighed 2 5 observed cotton evapotranspiration and crop coefficients actual cotton et in the studies was calculated as the residual of the root zone swb eq 8 for periods bounded by two adjacent dates of θv measurements 8 etc act dr 2 dr 1 i p dp where etc act is the total actual et mm that occurred in the period from the first 1 to second 2 measurement date dr 1 and dr 2 are the measured root zone soil water depletion mm on the first and second date respectively the i p and dp respectively are total depth of measured irrigation mm total measured precipitation 1 0 mm per day and total deep percolation below the root zone mm that occurred during the period the θv was measured to a 1 9 m depth to allow adequate assessment of the crop water use extraction depth and detection of water percolating below that depth analysis of θv by depth and time showed that little soil water was depleted below 1 5 m thus etc act was calculated for a zr of 1 6 m i e using neutron probe readings down to 1 5 m and assuming sphere of influence or effective radius of np readings was 0 10 m however there was occasionally a slight increase in θv below the 1 5 m depth at some locations from one measurement date to the next on occasions when an increase in θv measured at 1 7 and 1 9 m was greater than 1 0 mm i e on a depth basis from the first to second date that amount was input as dp in eq 8 the etc act calculations were made separately for each of the two np access tube locations within a plot with three replications gave six locations per irrigation treatment using the θv data at the given tube location for dr in eq 8 however the same total measured i to a given plot was used in eq 8 for the two locations in the plot the p amounts 1 0 mm d 1 provided by the azmet weather station were added in eq 8 for all locations in each of the years field capacity i e when dr zero was estimated separately for each location the first θv measurements were not made until 21 21 and 12 days after planting in the 2016 2017 and 2018 years respectively therefore the fc for a np location was estimated by assuming the given location s dr at the first θv measurement date in a year was equal to the dr at that date as calculated by the irrigation scheduling model described in section 2 3 thus at the first θv measurement in each year all locations for both 100 and 70 irrigation treatments were assumed to start at the same estimated dr which were 16 8 10 2 and 1 6 mm for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively table 1 gives the average estimated fc for each plot replicate by irrigation treatment in all three years for example if the starting dr was 16 8 mm 2016 and the first θv measurements of the crop root zone calculated stored water to be 396 mm then at fc stored water would be 412 8 mm or an average soil water content of 0 258 m3 m 3 it was also assumed that available water holding capacity was the same at all locations and years i e 128 mm m 1 a field average value as referred to earlier the components of the swb in eq 8 were evaluated on a seasonal basis for the two treatments in each year each swb component was statistically analyzed using proc mixed sas 2013 to determine treatment differences in these analyses irrigation treatment was considered a fixed effect while replicate and replicate by irrigation were considered random effects actual single kc kc act and basal kcb kcb act values were derived for each period using the total etc act determined by eq 8 for this a daily swb of the root zone similar to eq 3 was calculated for each neutron tube location starting on the first and ending on the last θv measurement date in each year in the swb the total etc act for each period was modeled as daily actual et etc act i whose sum was required to be equal to the total etc act in the period but whose values varied according to daily eto estimated daily soil water stress and daily soil evaporation the etc act i values in each period were found by iteration of the fao56 dual kc calculations until daily values of ks i kcb act ke i eto i summed to total etc act in the period eq 9 9 et cact i 1 j k s i k cbact k e i et o i i 1 j et cact i where etc act is the total mm for all days from 1 to j in a given period determined by eq 8 kcb act is a uniform single value basal crop coefficient for each day i to j in a given period ks i is the water stress coefficient on day i ke i is the soil evaporation coefficient on day i eto i is the pm eto mm on day i and etc act i is daily actual crop et mm on day i the ke i were determined using the fao56 dual kc procedures which included a separate daily swb of the surface soil layer 0 10 m and use of the governing ke i equation above in eq 7 for all locations the ke soil parameters rew 9 mm and tew 20 mm and the wetted soil fraction fw were the same as those described in the irrigation scheduling section 2 3 however the daily values of h and fc that are also used in computing daily ke were based on the measured h and fc for each location interpolated to daily values thus the parameters used to calculate ke i in eq 7 were often variable for the np tube locations daily values for ks i were computed using eqs 4 and 6 the p values used for calculating ks i for 100 locations were adjusted daily using the fao56 numerical approximation allen et al 1998 for days when etc act i differed from 5 0 mm d 1 10 pi pcotton 0 04 5 etc act i where pi is the daily value and pcotton is the p value for cotton of 0 65 when etc act i is equal to 5 0 mm d 1 as given in fao56 the average daily etc reported for well watered cotton at maricopa are on the order of 6 5 7 0 mm d 1 but rates often exceed 12 0 mm d 1 during summer months hunsaker 1999 hunsaker et al 2005 2015 thus for the hot dry weather conditions and high etc rates at this location water stress can reduce actual etc of the 100 irrigation treatment locations to some extent even though the estimated swd 30 and modeled daily ks was computed 1 0 except for a few days at the end of the season in contrast in the ks i analysis of the 70 irrigation treatment locations in each year eq 10 was used but the pcotton value was varied systematically in 0 025 increments from 0 60 to 0 70 this analysis was performed to calibrate the pcotton value and thereby the computed ks i values that best agreed with the reduction in measured etc act for the 70 treatment in this analysis the average daily ks i computed for each period was compared to the ratio of the average measured etc act of the 70 to the 100 irrigation treatment best agreement was obtained when linear correlation of the computed average ks i versus the measured etc act ratio for all periods in the year achieved the highest positive correlation coefficient r the method used was the pearson r performed with sigmaplot systat software san jose ca daily actual kc kc act i values were computed as the summation of kcb act x ks i ke i in eq 9 the average of the kc act i values for each period was exactly equal to the summation of etc act i in the period divided by the summation of the eto i in the period when the ks i was calculated as 1 0 for all days in the period when one or more days in a period had ks i less than 1 0 then the average of the kc act i values was higher than summed etc act i summed eto i for those periods treatment means of average kc act i data for periods were evaluated as a function of days after planting dap the mean of the average kc act i data of the 100 treatments for the periods in each year were used to construct daily fao56 segmented kc act curves the curves in each year were based on growth stage durations that best approximated the trends in the mean kc act i data upon establishing the four growth stage durations in each year the kc act values for the horizontal segments of the initial and mid season growth stages were determined by averaging the mean kc act i data for all periods that were within those stages respectively the end of season kc act value used for constructing the daily curve for the late season stage was the mean of the final kc act i determined in each year just before cotton termination an fao56 segmented kcb act curve was developed in a similar manner for each year with the 100 treatment mean kcb act i data determined for periods in the analyses for transferability of the observed crop coefficients at this arid site the mid season kc act and kcb act values of the derived fao56 curves for each year were also adjusted to represent the standard climate conditions proposed in fao56 where minimum relative humidity rhmin 45 and wind speed at 2 m above the ground surface u2 2 m s 1 the adjustments were made using the transfer equations provided in pereira et al 2020 3 results 3 1 weather during the three cotton years at maricopa monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures tmax and tmin respectively increased 2 3 c from april to may and then increased 5 8 c from may to june table 2 temperatures in early growth periods of april and may were generally higher in 2017 and 2018 than in 2016 however during june the mean tmax and tmin were 1 5 and 2 0 c cooler in 2018 than in june 2017 and 2016 respectively during the months of june and july daily tmax 43 4 c occurred 20 14 and 7 times in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 tmax 43 4 c occurred for nine consecutive days from june 18 26 including four days during that period with tmax 46 5 c in 2016 and 2018 temperatures above 46 5 c occurred only on one day in each season however mean cotton growing degree day gdd for june computed by the azmet station at mac does not reflect the higher daily tmax in 2017 due to an upper threshold temperature limit of 30 0 c used in computing gdd https cals arizona edu azmet monthly mean eto in june 2017 was about 1 0 mm d 1 higher than for other years while monthly mean eto was similar in other months for the three years mean rhmin was higher in april june in 2016 and lower in the month of july 2016 compared to 2017 and 2018 table 2 monthly solar radiation rs and u2 means were similar among the months of each year precipitation was very light throughout the entire 2016 season 28 mm total and light in april through june in 2017 and 2018 however in 2017 significant p occurred in july and aug while in 2018 68 mm of p occurred between aug 02 13 3 2 irrigation soil water depletion growth and yield planting dates for the three years were within ten calendar days of each other with the earliest planting on april 2 in 2018 table 3 in each year chemical defoliants were applied when the cotton bolls in the 100 irrigation treatments were more than 90 open giving season lengths of 148 164 and 149 days for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2017 some vegetative regrowth occurred in late aug slowing boll opening in that year by about two weeks compared to the other years because the season was longer in 2017 cumulative eto was also higher than the other years table 3 however on a daily basis average eto was essentially the same in all years 7 8 7 9 mm d 1 total irrigation applied from planting through defoliation for the 100 treatments ranged from 904 mm in 2016 to 1057 mm in 2017 where establishment irrigation was about 100 mm more in 2017 than 2016 the 70 irrigation treatment received between 74 and 77 of total irrigation applied to the 100 treatment in the three years measured mean swd expressed as a percentage of taw eq 5 is shown for the two irrigation treatments on a timescale of days after planting dap with day one being the planting date in fig 2 the measured mean swd during the first 60 dap for the two treatments fluctuated from 5 to 32 in 2016 4 29 in 2017 and 1 6 19 in 2018 indicating ample available soil water for both irrigation treatments to that point in all years measured mean swd for the 100 treatments increased with time after 60 dap to values 35 or above on 98 91 and 92 dap in 2016 2017 and 2018 fig 2a b and c respectively mean swd for 100 treatments remained below 40 until late in each year when they increased to values of 44 and higher starting on 126 140 and 128 dap in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the effects of accumulated irrigation deficits for 70 irrigation treatments resulted in mean swd becoming more than 10 higher than that for 100 treatments starting at 56 dap in 2016 fig 2a 71 dap in 2017 fig 2b and 68 dap in 2018 fig 2c the differences in treatment swd then generally widened in all years until 84 dap in 2016 133 dap in 2017 and 106 dap in 2018 at those measurement dates mean swd for the 100 and 70 treatments were 28 and 53 31 and 62 and 27 and 56 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the time periods associated with the biggest differences in mean swd values between the 70 and 100 treatments i e when mean swd for 70 treatments exceeded mean swd for 100 treatments by 20 or more were not the same in the three years in 2016 the time period was from 70 to 98 dap where mean swd averaged 50 versus 27 for the 100 treatment however the differences were more extensive and for a longer duration in 2017 from 108 to 140 dap in 2017 averages of 63 and 36 for the 70 and 100 and less extensive and for a shorter duration in 2018 from 100 to 114 dap in 2018 59 versus 35 respectively during mid season or 75 125 dap mean swd for the 70 treatment averaged 54 55 and 55 respectively while mean swd for 100 for that period averaged 34 35 and 35 respectively in 2016 2017 and 2018 standard deviation bars about the means indicated variation of swd was generally greater within the 100 treatment compared to the 70 treatment fig 2 biomass for the 100 treatments decreased from a high of 14 9 mg ha 1 in 2016 12 4 mg ha 1 in 2018 table 3 however lint yields increased from 1470 kg ha 1 in 2016 1780 kg ha 1 and 2200 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively according to bronson et al 2019 both biomass and lint yield were significantly higher for the 100 than the 70 treatment in each year notably lint yield for the 70 irrigation treatment in 2018 was much higher than the 70 treatment yields in the other years and remarkably the 70 treatment lint yield was also higher than the lint yields for the 100 treatments in 2016 and 2017 maximum measured mean crop height h and cover fraction fc for 100 treatments were 1 38 0 23 m and 0 95 0 03 in 2016 1 18 0 14 m and 0 96 0 04 in 2017 and 1 24 0 08 m and 0 99 0 02 in 2018 for 70 treatments the mean values were 0 98 0 07 m and 0 80 0 03 0 92 0 03 m and 0 81 0 07 and 1 01 0 03 m and 0 91 0 02 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 3 3 cotton evapotranspiration the observed mean etc act for each period from eq 8 is shown for treatments in the 2016 2017 and 2018 cotton years in tables 4 6 respectively the mean ratio of etc act of the 70 and 100 hereafter referred to as the etc act ratio was above 1 0 for measured periods in 2016 and 2018 prior to the start of differential irrigation amounts on may 25 44 dap and may 02 31 dap respectively in 2017 etc act ratios were less than 1 0 before differential irrigations commenced on may 15 35 dap though mean differences in etc act for the two treatments were less than 2 1 mm for those periods table 5 in all years etc act ratios began to decline after the 70 irrigation treatment was imposed indicating reduced etc act for 70 treatments by about 70 75 dap mid to late june the etc act ratio had declined to 0 79 0 80 in all years this time marks the approximate beginning of the mid season growth stage in the years measurements in subsequent periods through about 125 dap beginning of the late season stage showed etc act ratios as low as 0 65 66 in 2016 and 2018 but only 0 77 in 2017 however the mean cumulative etc act ratio was similar in all years 0 77 0 79 tables 4 6 mean daily etc act of the 100 treatments for the measured periods in tables 4 6 ranged from 1 5 to 12 1 mm d 1 2016 fig 3a 1 1 13 5 mm d 1 2017 fig 3b and 1 0 12 4 mm d 1 2018 fig 3c the highest mean daily etc act of the 70 treatments for all periods was 8 3 10 8 and 9 4 mm d 1 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 3 also shows the average daily irrigation rates for the 100 treatment and precipitation amounts 1 0 mm for each year mean cumulative etc act summed over all measurement periods tables 4 6 was higher by 31 and 77 mm for the 100 treatment in 2017 than in 2018 and 2016 respectively years in which the cotton season was about two weeks shorter and cumulative eto was about 110 mm less than in 2017 table 3 the differences in cumulative etc act between the 100 and 70 treatments were significant in each year table 7 where the 100 treatment cumulative etc act was about 215 mm higher in each year evaluation of the other seasonal soil water balance components indicated significant differences between the treatments in cumulative irrigation applied in each year and the change in soil water storage except in 2016 table 7 the mean cumulative dp calculated for 100 treatments was 4 5 6 9 and 6 0 mm and for the 70 treatments 1 2 0 0 and 1 5 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively significant differences in dp between treatments occurred in 2017 and 2018 but not 2016 table 7 the etc adj estimated for the irrigation scheduling over the same measurement periods agreed reasonably well with mean etc act of the 100 through about 40 50 dap in all years tables 4 6 and fig 3 in 2016 mean daily etc act of the 100 was markedly higher than etc adj 1 0 2 0 mm d 1 for periods from 50 to 70 dap and generally somewhat higher less than 0 9 mm d 1 through about 110 dap fig 3a during the late season in 2016 etc adj was higher particularly for the last period mean daily etc act of the 100 was markedly higher than etc adj 1 0 1 9 mm d 1 for periods from 57 to 77 dap in 2017 fig 3b after that differences in daily for etc act and etc adj were 0 6 mm d 1 or less until the last two periods in 2017 when etc adj was about 1 6 mm d 1 higher in 2018 daily etc act was consistently higher than etc adj in periods from 60 through 130 dap though the differences ranged from 0 3 to 1 6 mm d 1 fig 3c however the etc adj was much higher for the last period in 2018 similar to 2016 and 2017 cumulative etc adj was less than mean etc act for the 100 treatment by 6 18 and 56 mm in 2016 2017 and 2018 tables 4 6 respectively 3 4 soil water stress fig 4 shows the mean etc act ratio for the periods in each year along with the calibrated best fit mean ks for the 70 treatment locations during the same periods the best r values between calibrated mean ks for the 70 treatment with the mean etc act ratio over the periods shown were with pcotton values within eq 10 of 0 60 in 2016 fig 4a 0 675 in 2017 fig 4b and 0 675 in 2018 fig 4c the r values were 0 95 0 72 and 0 81 for 2016 2017 2018 respectively measurement periods prior to those in fig 4 i e before 70 75 dap were not used in the correlation analysis since the daily mean ks for the 70 was computed as 1 0 prior to 70 75 dap regardless of the pcotton value used however the mean etc act ratio was considerably less than 1 0 in all years for periods prior to 70 75 dap as shown in tables 4 6 the agreement between calibrated mean ks and the mean etc act ratio was reasonable in all years between about 85 130 dap or the mid season growth stage agreement was generally less favorable during the late season when measured and calibrated data were more variable among locations than during mid season evaluation of the daily mean ks estimated for the 100 treatment assuming pcotton 0 65 suggested that minor water stress occurred for some days in each year fig 5 since the daily ks values in fig 5 are the means of the six locations in the treatment a mean daily ks less than 1 0 on a day indicates root zone depletion exceeded the readily available soil water at one or more locations the estimated mean daily ks for the 100 treatment in each year dropped to the lowest value of 0 95 on 107 dap in 2016 fig 5a 0 97 on 89 dap in 2017 fig 5b and 0 89 on 128 dap in 2018 fig 5c on those particular days the eto values were high 10 4 11 3 and 9 9 mm while the mean etc act of the 100 treatments were 12 0 1 5 12 9 0 7 and 11 5 0 5 mm and mean percent swd values were 42 4 4 7 37 7 6 8 and 48 9 6 7 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the corresponding mean p values on those days were 0 37 0 34 and 0 39 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively periods of several consecutive days in which estimated mean daily ks was less than 1 0 occurred for the 100 treatment from 102 to 111 dap average of daily mean ks 0 977 and from 123 to 126 dap 0 986 in 2016 and from 85 to 97 dap 0 987 in 2017 in 2018 estimated mean daily ks 1 for consecutive days was very infrequent although there was a short period late in the 2018 from 126 to 128 dap when the average mean daily ks was 0 944 although occasional water stress reduction as indicated by days when mean daily ks 1 may have slightly reduced daily etc act for 100 treatments the etc act ratios shown in fig 4 would be only minimally changed had there been no water stress in the 100 treatments mean daily ks for the 70 treatments using the calibrated pcotton values did not fall below 1 0 in the three years until 72 74 dap fig 5 in 2016 lower mean daily ks occurred from 85 to 110 dap early to late july than at other times in the season fig 5a mean daily ks ranged from 0 654 to 0 894 and averaged 0 765 between 85 and 110 dap in 2016 a 35 day time period that corresponded to the highest swd 53 58 for the 70 treatment until late in the 2016 season fig 2a in 2017 fig 5b mean daily ks for the 70 treatments declined earlier than in 2016 where mean daily ks in 2017 averaged 0 909 between 72 and 84 dap compared to an average of 0 978 during the same period in 2016 however between 85 and 110 dap in 2017 mean daily ks were generally not as low averaging 0 806 than the mean daily ks during the same period 35 day period in 2016 although swd was similar for the 70 treatments during that period in both years fig 2 conversely in 2017 during the time period when mean swd differences between the 70 and 100 treatments were the greatest i e 108 140 dap fig 2 mean daily ks averaged 0 791 compared to a much higher mean daily ks average of 0 934 for the same period in 2016 when swd differences between irrigation treatments were smaller in 2018 from 85 to 100 dap mean daily ks for the 70 treatment varied from 0 594 to 1 0 and averaged 0 764 over the period similar to that in 2016 for the same period the lowest mean daily ks in 2018 corresponded to a time period when the mean swd for the 70 treatment was about 62 110 130 dap in that period the average mean daily ks of the 70 treatment was 0 708 and swd for the 100 treatment was 44 3 5 crop coefficients the observed mean kc act of the 100 irrigation treatments for the measured periods are shown with dap in fig 6 a c for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in all years the kc act and kcb act data increased in a near linear manner from the initial stage through the development stage the kc act data for periods during the initial stage were sparse however since neutron tubes were not installed until about halfway into that stage during periods at mid season in 2017 and 2018 kc act values did not fluctuate appreciably and therefore generally followed the horizontal trend proposed by fao56 for that growth stage in 2016 however the kc act data did not show a clear plateau at mid season but showed a curvilinear trend from beginning to end of the mid season stage with a kc act peak at 102 dap the late season stages were short and kc act data points during late season were also scant especially in 2016 and 2018 when the intervals between θv measurements were longer than those through mid season the agreement between the constructed kc act curve with the kc act data is very good in 2017 and 2018 except during the late season when actual data for comparison of the curve was limited the daily kc act curve constructed in 2016 tends to underestimate the kc act data during the development stage as well as overestimate kc act data during early and late portions of the mid season stage the differences between the kc act and kcb act data and curves indicate the estimated evaporation during the years fig 6 for measured data in each year the kc act ranged between 0 0 and 0 06 higher than kcb act during the mid season stage this difference was 0 06 0 05 and 0 04 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the growth stage parameters used in constructing the daily kc act and kcb act curves are shown in table 8 the lengths of the initial and development stages were similar in all years where the number of days from planting through development varied by four days or less average growth lengths for the three years were 33 1 2 days and 42 3 1 days for the initial and development stages respectively table 8 cumulative growing degree days cgdd for growth stages also shown in table 8 were similar among the years during the initial stage though cgdd was somewhat higher during the development stage in 2016 due primarily to more days in that stage than in other years the mid season stage length was the longest in 2017 55 days followed by 52 and 45 days in 2018 and 2016 respectively the average mid season length for years was 51 5 1 days the cgdd during the mid season stage for the years increased with the number of days in that stage the late season length averaged for the years was 28 5 3 the 2017 late season was notably longer 8 10 days than in the other years total cggd was about 255 d greater in 2017 than 2016 and 2018 for the three years the average season length was 154 9 0 days corresponding to a yearly average of total cgdd of 2100 148 d table 8 the mean kc act and kcb act values of the 100 irrigation treatment for the initial and mid season stages and the end of season values used in the daily curves are shown in table 9 for each year the kc act and kcb act values for the initial stage reflect only the latter half of that stage when irrigation was infrequent and precipitation was negligible therefore the observed kc act and estimated kcb act for this part of the initial stage were similar in all years 0 21 0 22 on average the average observed mid season kc act for the three years table 9 was highest in 2018 1 34 and lowest in 2017 1 28 in contrast the estimated mid season kc adj with an assumed 1 2 mid season kcb used in the irrigation scheduling was lower than the observed averaging 1 26 in all years the average observed mid season kc act values for each year were adjusted to represent the standard climate conditions proposed in fao56 where rhmin 45 and u2 2 m s 1 these adjustments resulted in mid season kc act of 1 20 1 25 over the three years with an average of 1 22 table 9 the estimated average kcb act at mid season were lower by 0 04 0 06 than the kc act in the years table 9 when adjusted to the standard climate the estimated mid season kcb act vary from 1 15 to 1 21 over the three years with an average of 1 17 in each year the end of season kc act and kcb act values were the same because during the last measurement period the surface layer soil water was completely depleted and no soil evaporation occurred the end season kcb act values for the three years ranged between 0 29 and 0 48 and averaged 0 37 table 9 the lower end of season kcb act values observed in 2016 and 2017 than in 2018 were possibly due to higher swd at the end season in those years than in 2018 fig 2 4 discussion the lint yield of the 100 treatment in 2016 was lower than the 2016 state average upland cotton lint yield for arizona of 1710 kg ha 1 usda nass 2019 tables 2 3 in contrast lint yields for 100 treatments were 10 higher than the state average yield in 2017 1640 kg ha 1 and 50 higher than the state average yield in 2018 1480 kg ha 1 the lower lint yield in 2016 was associated with several consecutive days of severe heat stress during the squaring stage early june resulting in small squares dropping bronson et al 2019 also total water applied including precipitation was 170 and 100 mm less in 2016 than in 2017 and 2018 respectively the high lint yield in 2018 compared to the two other years may have been attributed to the earlier planting date which led to more moderate temperatures during squaring and flowering periods also during boll ripening in the late season the 2018 climate was milder and had higher humidity than in the other years and had several significant p events consistently the lint yield was much higher for the 70 irrigation treatment in 2018 compared to other years in 2018 70 treatment plants were slightly taller and achieved greater plant cover than in other years the reduction of lint yield for the 70 treatment than that of the 100 treatment was 15 16 in 2016 and 2018 but it was 36 in 2017 the 70 treatment in 2017 suffered earlier onset of water stress than the 70 treatment in other years likely due to the extreme high temperatures and eto rates 10 mm d 1 that occurred in late june 72 77 dap of that year when the crop was well into flowering the earlier water stress for the 70 in 2017 than in other years is also supported by the lower etc act ratios during the first 80 dap in 2017 while swd values for the 70 treatments were similar during the mid season in all years the swd values for the 70 treatment in 2017 differed more extensively relative to the swd of the 100 than in other years also consistent with the greater yield reduction for the 70 in 2017 radin et al 1992 stated that soil water deficit effects on cotton yield are most pronounced when the deficits occur during peak fruiting typically 75 95 dap in arizona when full irrigation of cotton cannot be met doorenbos and kassam 1979 maintained that water deficits should be distributed to vegetative and ripening periods but that water stress during flowering should be avoided however de kock et al 1990 indicated that when water is limited preference should be given for irrigation during boll development followed by early flowering and then peak flowering however loka et al 2011 pointed out that the most sensitive water stress period in relation to yield is not clearly understood loka et al 2011 concluded that water stress effects on yield depend not only on the timing of stress but also on the extent of stress as well as the way stress occurs e g sudden versus gradual as stated the greater yield reduction for the 70 treatment relative to the 100 in 2017 than other years appears to be related to the earlier water deficits during flowering in that year as well the more extensive differences in swd between the two treatments during the boll development phase the cumulative etc act for the 100 treatment in the three years were higher than the estimated cumulative etc adj which used the hunsaker et al 2005 crop coefficients and growth stage lengths for the 100 irrigation treatment scheduling generally etc act rates for the 100 treatment were substantially higher than the etc adj rates starting in the development stage and continuing through the mid season growth stage in each year conversely etc adj were higher than observed in the three years during the late season although the lengths of the growth stages in the present study were consistent to those of hunsaker et al 2005 for the initial mid season and late season stages the lengths of the development stages in the present study were considerably shorter 42 3 1 days versus 51 days the etc act and etc adj during the initial stage were similar corresponding to the close agreement between observed kcb act 0 21 3 year average with the 0 15 kcb value assumed in the estimation model however the higher mid season kcb act and shorter development stage observed in the present study compared to the hunsaker et al 2005 data were a consequence of the higher etc act rates than those estimated starting in the development stage this trend of higher observed than estimated et was associated with gradually increasing swd for the 100 treatment starting in the development stage of each year soil water content measurements indicated deep percolation loss was minimal although the 100 treatments were essentially irrigated daily during these growth stages modeled daily ks indicated that slight water stress may have occasionally occurred due to underestimated et and irrigation requirement the higher etc adj than observed rates that occurred during the late season stages where attributed to the estimated end of season kcb value used 0 51 that was higher than the observed 0 37 3 year average in this situation the end of season etc act for sdi treatments was low due to early termination of irrigation in the late season which led to heightened root zone swd and no occurrence of soil evaporation at the end of the season period the results from the present study having near daily sdi during mid season indicate higher mid season kcb act values occurred compared to those previously reported using surface and sprinkler irrigation at this same location hunsaker et al 2005 2016 thorp et al 2017 reasonably assuming that the total pm eto in maricopa during the cotton mid season stage is approximately equal among years the kcb act results in the present study suggest daily cotton etc rates may vary upwards by 2 10 when using sdi versus surface and sprinkler irrigation higher etc rates for sdi than for surface irrigation is contrary to the general premise that sdi should decrease etc because less evaporation occurs while transpiration does not change however a detailed analysis of crop et under different irrigation methods in california usa by burt et al 2002 also showed that for a wide variety of crops sdi tends to increase etc by 6 10 over the etc using surface and sprinkler irrigation methods ayars et al 1999 colaizzi et al 2004 2010 reported irrigation method comparison studies for a number of crops that consistently show equal or higher cumulative etc but lower soil evaporation using sdi than surface and sprinkler irrigation methods this suggests the hypothesis that when evaporation is reduced in sdi application a gain in plant available water for transpiration is realized evett et al 1995 rosa et al 2012 when deficit irrigation is practiced lamm et al 2012 note that sdi more effectively stabilizes crop yields than when other irrigation methods are used observed cotton mid season kc and kcb values can vary widely with climatic conditions as shown in pereira et al 2020 in this arid climate the local mid season values using sdi were higher than the fao56 maximum standard climate values of 1 2 and 1 15 for mid season kc and kcb respectively however in all years the mid season kc kcb values 0 08 0 15 higher than fao56 were below the maximum limit of 0 20 allen et al 1998 as pointed out by allen et al 2011 and more recently pereira et al 2020 the upper limit of kc based on the grass reference eto may be as high as 1 4 for tall well watered crops in arid and semiarid climates exceptionally high kc values are generally associated with strong regional advection allen et al 2011 the highest observed kc act for any 6 14 day period in the 3 year sdi study was 1 43 in late july 2018 the observed mid season kc act and kcb act values after adjustment to standard climate averaged 1 22 0 03 and 1 17 0 04 respectively which are each 0 02 higher than the standard fao56 mid season values despite analysis indicating that minor water stress may have occasionally occurred in the well watered treatment the crop management and agronomic conditions of the cotton were otherwise quite optimal since the crop coefficient data were corrected for the minor water stress through the use of modeled daily ks the coefficient values presented are deemed entirely adequate for meeting the standard condition addressed in fao56 and thus transferable pereira et al 2020 in each year the end of season kc act and kcb act values were the same since no e occurred the recommended end of season kcb for cotton in fao56 is a range from 0 40 to 0 50 pereira et al 2020 in their update proposed 0 40 for end of season cotton in the present study sdi the end of season kcb act averaged just 0 03 lower than 0 40 therefore the end of season kcb act value of 0 40 should be used for sdi management in the climate the analysis of etc act in the 70 deficit treatment indicated that the measured reduction as defined by the etc act ratio was well modeled during mid season by ks as computed using the fao56 dual procedures the daily ks values adjusted daily with the fao56 approximation equation fit the mid season etc act ratio best when pcotton was at 0 60 in 2016 and at 0 675 in 2017 and 2018 the lower pcotton value for 2016 was likely caused by more apparent stress in the 100 treatment in that year than other years nevertheless the 3 year average pcotton was 0 65 the same as in fao56 and rosa et al 2012 pereira et al 2020 however proposed the pcotton value be lowered to 0 60 during the development stage measured etc act ratios were less than 1 0 but ks computations did not reproduce the etc act reduction of the 70 treatment it is likely the reductions could have been reproduced if the actual depth of the crop root zone was known for the periods during development on the other hand differences in swd between the 100 and 70 were generally small during much of the development stage i e from 30 75 dap furthermore the measured swd for the 70 treatments during the development stage was generally 40 a depletion level well below the generally accepted threshold of 60 when water stress limits et for cotton jensen and allen 2016 5 conclusions actual etc etc act and yield of cotton were measured during a 3 year cotton experiment in arizona using sdi two irrigation treatments full 100 and deficit 70 both with optimum n management were evaluated cumulative etc act varied from 961 to 1039 mm for the 100 irrigation treatment in the three years and those for the 70 treatment 742 825 mm were 21 23 lower lint yields for the 100 treatment were considerably higher than arizona state average yields in two of the three years lint yield was significantly reduced for the 70 treatment in all years however the yield reduction increased from 15 to 16 36 in one of the years when water stress was more pronounced during the flowering period the observed mid season kc and kcb crop coefficients averaged 1 31 and 1 26 respectively which were higher than those reported at this location in other studies but consistent with the tabulated mid season cotton values for the fao56 standard climate the observed kcb and kc for the initial growth stage averaged 0 21 0 22 respectively and at the end of season both values averaged 0 37 which were similar to the fao56 values provided for those growth stages estimated cotton growth stage lengths of 33 42 51 and 28 for the initial development mid season and late season stages respectively are recommended for developing the fao56 kc or kcb curves when using sdi baseline values of the soil water depletion fraction for no stress p used in modeling the 70 treatment et reduction by the water stress coefficient ks were developed values for the years varied between 0 60 and 0 675 while the 3 year average was 0 65 which is also the recommended baseline p value for cotton in fao56 full irrigation of cotton in this arid climate requires an available water supply that meets the daily etc of cotton at mid season thus sdi systems will need to apply water at a rate of 11 13 mm d 1 starting in the latter portion of the development stage recommended soil water depletion for full irrigation should be between 20 30 to avoid water stress and yield reduction deficit irrigation management should avoid water stress until after peak flowering or after 80 days after planting declaration of competing

10068,a robust soil water system is essential for achieving most of the sustainable development goals of united nations systems approach is essential to keep the soil water system to derive sustainable benefits prevention is better than cure hence accurate prediction of the likely results of our action on soil water system is needed hydrus is one of the handy tools for simulating root zone under drip irrigation to derive best management practices for water and nutrient application hydrus is parameter intensive software hence mostly there is a tendency to use typical values of parameters available in the literature for modelling in this research work we generated data for hydrus by intensive field experimentation to improve the reliability of modelling the first order rate constants of urea ammonium nitrate reactions were obtained by field experimentation hydrus was used numerically to simulate nitrogen transport for paddy crop under drip irrigation from the simulation various fluxes of urea ammonium and nitrate were quantified to develop a n fertigation schedule for entire crop duration the fertigation schedule was implemented by raising a paddy crop and evaluation was done by estimating n assimilation of crop by plant sample analysis the simulated values of nitrogen uptake were in good agreement with the observed values of nitrogen uptake keywords hydrus root zone modelling fertigation paddy 1 introduction fifteenth goal of sustainable development goals sdg of united nations un envisions to combat desertification restore degraded land and soil including land affected by desertification drought and floods and strive to achieve a land degradation neutral world by the year 2030 land degradation neutrality ldn is a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems administrators and researchers advocate the systems approach but while implementation systems are impoverished while achieving goals and again restoration is attempted with a very huge cost also all the systems approach gets weakened when the integrated approach encompasses too many subsystems therefore a paradigm shift in the systems approach would help if the function of the system follows the system s possibilities in which the boundary conditions for sustainable use of the system lead the permissible land use and management options keesstra et al 2018 a robust soil water system is essential for achieving most of the sustainable development goals sdg to achieve the sdgs an increase in pressure on land is to be expected agriculture management can determine the fate of soils and thus the sustainability of human society as well as the earth system because agriculture determines the rates of the processes involved in soil the need for food security that is emphasized in the first three sdgs which target the role of soil and its fertility in order to increase agricultural productivity in areas of high population growth rate montanarella and lobos alva 2015 efficiency of nutrient and water management practices depends on soil management good agricultural practices including soil nutrient and water management lead to better crop productivity and hence profitable farming scheduling and methods of n application play a vital role in crop productivity hammad et al 2017 most of the farmers in developing countries are not well aware of the water and nutrient requirements for optimum yield responsibility lies on the shoulders of researchers to provide farmers with the information that enables them to make informed choices to meet un sdgs especially those relating to sustainable use of soil and water for food security agriculture amounts to 92 of the globe s freshwater use far ahead of industrial and domestic usage hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 agriculture consumes 80 of available fresh water in india in that paddy alone consumes 42 of available water tyagi et al 2000 decreasing fresh water resources and increasing demand for rice due to population growth leads to the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies for rice by adopting drip irrigation 40 50 of water applied for paddy can be saved sidhu et al 2019 in this regard modelling the dynamics of water and nutrient movement in root zone has gained a lot of impetus in this decade the developments in the hydrus simunek et al 2016 have attracted researchers towards modelling and field experimentations to develop strategies to efficiently manage water and nutrients hydrus simunek et al 1999 is a parameter intensive model which needs input data such as root characteristics water uptake pattern urea ammonium nitrate reaction rate data and unsaturated hydraulic characteristics of the soil the accuracy of the model results predominantly depends on the quality of the input data in majority of the literature reported typical values of urea ammonium nitrate reaction rate constants were used in the modelling process similarly the root water uptake parameters were used by many researchers by giving the data of maximum root spread and maximum root density ravikumar et al 2011 azad et al 2019 though hydrus offers accurate representation of the dynamics of water and nutrient transport in the root zone if unverified values in the field are used to simulate then results are bound to be less reliable hence research in the application of hydrus for fertigation scheduling should be directed towards finding the values of the parameters right in the field vrugt et al 2001a 2001b found out the root water uptake parameters by inverse methods using hydrus from a set of soil moisture data it should be noted that the inverse mode for finding rwu parameters in hydrus is still not available for the hydrus software package users for estimating rwu parameters using hydrus an additional code ought to be added with the help of the hydrus developers hupet et al 2002 2003 extensively researched in finding the root water uptake parameters they studied the issues such as non uniqueness instability and uncertainty in determining rwu and soil parameters by inverse methods for vertical one dimension in order to overcome the problem of instability both rwu and soil parameters have to be found out simultaneously however they reported that non uniqueness problem gets introduced for the medium fine textured soils when both soil and rwu parameters are estimated simultaneously angaleeswari and ravikumar 2019 developed an inverse methodology to find out root water uptake parameters which does not suffer from instability and demonstrated the methodology for paddy crop under drip irrigation in the present work input data for hydrus was obtained by an extensive field experimentation followed by relevant analytical work using this data an optimal schedule of nitrogen was developed for paddy crop by simulation of the water urea ammonium and nitrate movements in the vadose zone and verification of the nitrogen schedule was done by planting a paddy crop the root water uptake parameters were used from angaleeswari and ravikumar 2019 which was the same field in which this research was carried out the urea ammonium nitrate reaction rate constants were experimentally found out right in the field to represent the climate and soil characteristics the variably saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters were also found out by conducting a double ring infiltrometer test in the field combined with application of hydrus model in inverse mode by far no research has been reported in the literature where in application of hydrus for developing fertigation schedule by conducting maximum extent of field experimentation as our work presented here hence the experiences of our research are presented here 2 materials and methods 2 1 urea reactions in soil urea is the primary nitrogen fertilizer used by farmers for almost all crops urea easily dissolves in water when urea dissolves in water it gets converted into ammonium by hydrolysis process part of this ammonium gets volatilized into ammonia and lost into the atmosphere part of ammonium is taken up by plants the ammonium that has not taken up by plants converts into nitrate by nitrification process a part of nitrate is taken up by plants remaining nitrate is leached out of the root zone and reaches the ground water for proper scheduling of nitrogen fertilizer these losses need to be calculated conversion of urea into ammonium ammonia and nitrate depends on the reaction rate constants fig 1 mineralization gains of nitrogen were neglected in this study 2 2 coupled water flow and solute transport equations the hydrus 2d model uses the two dimensional form of richards equation to describe transient water flow in homogeneous isotropic and unsaturated soils 1 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h s h where θ is the volumetric water content cm3cm 3 t is time d k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 h is the pressure head cm x and z are horizontal and vertical spatial coordinates cm respectively of the simulated soil domain and s h is a sink term accounting for plant root water uptake d 1 soil hydraulic variables were found by adopting van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 the solute transport equation solved for each chemical species is as follows for urea 2 θ c 1 t θ d c 1 q c 1 μ a θ c 1 s w c 1 for ammonium 3 θ c 2 t ρ s 2 t θ d c 2 q c 2 μ v θ c 2 μ n θ c 2 μ a θ c 1 s w c 2 for nitrate 4 θ c 3 t θ d c 3 q c 3 μ n θ c 2 s w c 3 where ci is the liquid phase concentration of the chemical species i subscripts 1 2 and 3 represent urea ammonium and nitrate respectively g cm 3 d is the dispersion coefficient tensor cm2 day 1 q is the volumetric flux density cm day 1 ρ is the bulk density of the soil g cm 3 s2 is the adsorbed concentration of ammonium g g 1 the relationship between ammonium in solution c2 and adsorbed s2 is described as follows 5 s 2 k d c 2 where kd is the distribution coefficient for ammonium cm3g 1 eqs 2 4 and 5 are coupled equations that are solved sequentially solution of eq 1 provides the spatial and temporal distributions of water content θ the root water uptake distribution in the soil sw is obtained by solving eq 1 the reaction rate constants µa µ v and µn and the distribution coefficient for ammonium kd are concentration independent when solving eqs 2 5 the distributions of θ and sw are known and the unknowns are the solute concentrations namely concentrations of urea c1 ammonium c2 and nitrate c3 respectively the first order reaction term representing nitrification of urea to ammonium µa acts as sink in eq 2 and as source in eq 3 similarly the first order reaction term representing nitrification of ammonium to nitrate µn acts as sink in eq 3 and as source in eq 4 the last terms in eqs 2 4 are the products of root water uptake sw and concentrations of respective species and hence represent the passive uptake of urea ammonium and nitrate respectively 2 3 root water uptake the sink term sw represents the volume of water removed per unit time from a unit volume of soil due to plant water uptake the water stress is accounted using the model by feddes et al 1978 which is implemented in hydrus 6 s w h h s p where h is the soil water pressure head cm α h is the water stress response function which varies between 0 and 1 and sp is the potential root water uptake rate d 1 the potential root water uptake rate is non uniformly distributed within the root zone 7 s p b x z s t t p where b x z is the normalized root water uptake distribution in the vertical x z plane cm 2 st is the length of the soil surface associated with transpiration cm and tp is the potential transpiration rate cm d 1 2 4 modelled transport domain the crop row served by one drip irrigation lateral pipe is called as a paired row one lateral pipe per two crop rows was used crop geometry adopted is shown in fig 2 the distance between the crop rows within a pair is 20 cm and the spacing between the two pairs is 40 cm the plants within a row are spaced at 10 cm distance distance between the two successive laterals is 60 cm dripper discharge was 4l h 1 water movements from dripper are assumed as symmetric in both directions of the lateral along the x direction therefore only one half of the water distribution from the lateral pipe was considered for simulation modelled two dimensional transport domain was a rectangle with 30 cm wide and 45 cm deep as shown in fig 3 paddy plant was at 10 cm away from the top left boundary 2 5 boundary conditions for water flow a time variable flux boundary condition was applied at the left section of the soil surface to represent drip irrigation a dripper of 4l h 1 discharge rate was operated on the field and it was found that the ponding width around the dripper was 20 cm hence the length of variable flux boundary was 20 cm the variable flux boundary condition was switched to atmospheric boundary condition during the period of non irrigation the remaining 10 cm on the soil surface was given as atmospheric boundary condition no flow boundary conditions were applied to the sides of the flow domain bottom boundary was assumed as free drainage boundary with a unit hydraulic gradient 2 6 boundary conditions for solute transport a third type cauchy or solute flux boundary condition which predicts resident concentration volume averaged of solutes urea ammonium and nitrate within the simulation domain was used to represent the variable influx solute boundary 2 7 initial conditions for the simulation domain the soil at the start of the simulation was assumed dry and the initial pressure head was given as 300 cm and the initial solute concentration of all the solutes was assumed as zero we used an earlier version of hydrus 2d in which the root zone is assumed as a static one throughout the simulation period but in reality the root zone gradually increases as the crop grows root growth for the period was accounted by dividing the growth period into four sub periods 11 30 31 60 61 90 and 91 120 days the root depth and width in each of the successive sub periods were increased and within each sub period the root zone was assumed as static and non growing when the simulation model was run for the second sub period the final state of domain conditions of the first period simulation run was used as initial condition 2 8 root water uptake parameters hydrus distributes the root water uptake according to vrugt et al 2001a 8 b x z 1 x x m 1 z z m e p x x m x x p z z m z z where b x z is the normalized root water uptake distribution in the vertical x z plane cm 2 xm and zm are the maximum width and depth of the root zone cm respectively x and z are the location of the maximum root water uptake in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively px and pz are the empirical parameters root water uptake parameters table 1 used for simulation was adopted from angaleeswari and ravikumar 2019 these parameters were found out by inverse modelling and nonlinear optimization of estimated root water uptake distribution from the field observed soil moisture variation under drip irrigated paddy crop they found the parameters for every ten days time interval starting from 40th day after sowing to 110th day after sowing average values of root water uptake parameters calculated for simulation duration was used in eq 8 for the root water uptake parameters data used graphical root water uptake distribution is shown in fig 4 2 9 root water uptake reduction parameters root water uptake reduction parameters represent different pressure head values that affect the root water uptake in the soil the water uptake was assumed to be zero close to saturation fig 5 water uptake was considered as optimal between pressure heads h2 and h3 whereas for pressure head between h3 and h4 water uptake decreases linearly with h values of root water uptake reduction parameters used in the study were adopted from jyotiprava dash et al 2014 2 10 hydraulic conductivity by inverse modelling unsaturated hydraulic conductivity parameters were estimated using inverse modeling hydrus 1d of cumulative infiltration data from double ring infiltrometer the optimal parameter vector ks θs θr α n was found out by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between the observed and simulated cumulative depth of infiltration into the soil at different time periods by inverse modelling namitha and ravikumar 2017 running the hydrus 1d in inverse mode for the observed data of infiltration experiment yielded final estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters table 2 fig 6 shows the comparison of the observed cumulative infiltration depth and the simulated infiltration depth it can be seen that the simulated values and observed values fit very well 2 11 urea reaction rate constants the governing equations for urea reactions in soil when dispersion and advection are neglected are as follows for urea 9 θ c 1 t μ a θ c 1 for ammonium 10 θ c 2 t ρ s 2 t μ v θ c 2 μ n θ c 2 μ a θ c 1 for nitrate 11 θ c 3 t μ n θ c 2 integral equation for eq 9 if the soil moisture content is maintained constant is as follows 12 c1 t c1 0 e μa t eq 10 was expressed in explicit finite difference form as follows 13 θ c 2 t δt θ c 2 t δt 1 ρ k d θ μ v μ n θ c 2 t μ a θ c 1 0 e μ a t eq 13 was solved with an appropriate time step so that the results did not show oscillation a time step of half an hour was found to give satisfactory solution ammonium volatilized avt from the experiment was found out from the following equation 14 av t 0 t μ v θ c 2 dt where avt is the cumulative ammonium volatilized till time t to estimate the values of reaction rate constants using eqs 12 14 bolado et al 2005 devised a methodology and it was adopted in the present work this method involved a laboratory experiment in which only ammonia evolved was continuously monitored and from the data of cumulative ammonia evolved inverse modelling was done to estimate reaction rate constants 2 12 field experiment for estimation of urea reaction rate constants experiment was carried out in 500 ml of glass bottles bottles were arranged as shown in fig 7 there was a diaphragm pump to force the air into bottles b1 is the safety trap to prevent any reflux of liquid in case of system failure the safety trap is followed by bottle b2 containing distilled water for humidification of the air it is followed by bottle b3 containing boric acid to absorb the ammonium that may be present in the inlet air it is followed by bottles containing soils treated with urea b4 b5 b6 b7 the air exiting from bottles containing soil with urea was passed through 2 boric acid solution in b8 and b9 bottles in order to collect the volatilized ammonium emission of volatilized ammonia was determined by periodic titration of the boric acid solution collected from b8 and b9 bottles against 0 1 n h2so4 the experimental setup is kept under field capacity for unsaturated conditions fig 7 and 8 the experiment was carried out from 22nd may to 21st june 2017 the soil is sandy loam with a bulk density of 1 58 gm cm 3 and volumetric moisture content was maintained at field capacity 0 29 cm3 cm 3 the soil temperature readings were recorded at 9 30 am and 2 30 pm fig 9 shows the average soil temperature variation 38 0 43 5 c observed during the experiment period the initial concentration of urea n in the soil was taken as 20 9 mg cm 3 which corresponded to a dose of 7 5 g of urea per 750 g of soil fig 10 shows the cumulative ammonia evolved from the observations of cumulative ammonia evolved the urea reaction rate values were estimated by inverse modelling using a software analytical solver platform which is an add on extension of ms excel th objective function to be minimized is sum of squared deviations was minimum from the values of ammonia evolved from the experiment to the estimated values of ammonia evolved by calculating using the eqs 12 14 sequentially for every time step table 3 when the maximum and minimum values of urea reaction rate constants are specified with in the software the software does the search of optimal set of reaction rate constants for which the sum of squared deviations was minimum there is no guarantee that global optimum solution is achieved but many advanced search engines with in the software provides most likely global optimum solutions 2 13 dispersivity values for the soil the dispersivity reflects the degree of mechanical mixing of solutes caused by variations in water velocity the longitudinal dispersivity in a laboratory soil column was determined using the inversion of advection dispersion equation by namitha and ravikumar 2018 for the same soil in which the field experiments were carried out the longitudinal dispersivity was found to be 1 7 cm transverse dispersivity was taken as one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity hanson et al 2006 2 14 irrigation irrigation was given as depth of water applied per unit time constant flux on the time variable flux boundary fig 3 the duration of irrigation was calculated by using the following equations 15 application rate per unit area cm h 1 emitter discharge cm 3 h 1 lateral spacing cm emitter spacing cm 16 d u r a t i o n o f i r r i g a t i o n h e t c c m r a i n f a l l c m a p p l i c a t i o n r a t e c m h 1 it was assumed that rainfall on any day occurred before irrigation is given therefore effective rainfall on any day was equal to etc when rainfall was greater than the etc of any day if the rainfall was less than etc the total rainfall depth was taken as effective rainfall daily irrigation was given from 1 to 110 days from 111 120 days irrigation was not given as it is the conventional practice to allow maturity of the crop 2 15 water flux in hydrus for irrigation irrigation water applied was given in hydrus software as constant flux the flux calculation for surface drip irrigation is presented as below azad et al 2019 17 c o n s t a n t f l u x c m d 1 q f l o w r a t e c m 3 d 1 ponded a r e a c m 2 q a q 2 w l q constant

evaporation and transpiration hydrus requires potential evaporation and potential transpiration fluxes as input values in daily time step meteorological parameters of the study area for seven years 2010 2016 were collected to arrive at the average climatic parameters penman monteith equation was used to calculate the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 the reference crop evapotranspiration et0

ep and potential transpiration tp using crop leaf area index lai as given by ritchie 1972 19 e p et c e k gr lai 20 t p et c e p here kgr is an extension coefficient for global solar radiation its value was taken as 0 3 for the rice crop phogat et al 2010 lai of rice was calculated as 1 5 for 11 20 days 2 34 for 21 30 days 3 5 for 31 40 days 4 3 for 41 60 days and 6 for 61 120 days estimated potential evaporation and potential transpiration is shown in fig 11 2 17 fertigation for developing fertigation schedule nitrogen uptake curve for paddy was taken from juan and pablo 2013 and is shown in fig 12 from the curve n uptake required for the total crop period was found as 90 kg ha 1 from the uptake curve nitrogen uptake rate can be observed to be increasing up to 70 days and after that there is no significant amount of nitrogen uptake in this study the total crop period was taken as 120 days the first 10 days after sowing was considered as germination period so simulation was done from the 11th day after sowing das an optimal nitrogen schedule derived from simulation is the one which has the simulated nitrogen uptake curve which matches the target nitrogen uptake curve the final optimal uptake curve was derived by trial and error the main advantage of this method of fertigation scheduling is matching the nutrient requirement to the field requirement of the crop here soil type initial moisture content initial concentration of solutes could also be considered to develop the fertigation schedule 2 18 field verification of developed nitrogen schedule the developed nitrogen schedule for paddy under surface drip irrigation was verified for its applicability through field trial planting was done on 29 11 2017 for nutrition supply nitrogen was supplied as per the simulated schedule table 5 in the form of urea 50 kg ha 1 of phosphorous in the form of single super phosphate was applied as basal and 148 2 kg ha 1 of potassium as muriate of potash was applied with irrigation water as per recommendations for paddy crop under drip irrigation jainart www jains com timely weeding and insecticides spray were done to protect the crop from external competition for nutrition effect of simulated nitrogen schedule on growth and yield parameters like plant height number of tillers per square meter number of productive tillers per square meter 1000 grain weight number of filled grains per plant number of unfilled grains per plant paddy grain yield and paddy straw yield were recorded from four plants average value from the plant sample analysis taken on 80th and 120th days after sowing observed nitrogen uptake was calculated through lab analysis humphries 1956 and compared with the simulated nitrogen uptake 21 n u t r i e n t u p t a k e k g h a 1 p e r c

volatilized ammonia after fitting reaction rate constants and experimental ammonia in reaction rate constant experiment are shown in fig 13 the value of estimated and experimental volatilized ammonia matched well reaction rate constants for urea obtained from the experiments were compared with the available literature values table 4 urea hydrolysis rate constant was found to be higher in unsaturated soil condition when compared to the ponded condition distribution coefficient kd was higher in ponded condition while compared with unsaturated soil condition ammonia volatilization is higher in unsaturated soil condition higher temperature in unsaturated condition caused increase in volatilization loss anaerobic condition favoured nitrification process and caused higher value of nitrification coefficient under ponded conditions 3 2 water balance for 11 120 days of simulation validation of the hydrus model results were done by doing water balance and nitrogen balance the simulation results of water flow under surface drip irrigation are given below obtained overall water balance from the model results is shown in fig 14 mass balance error was observed as 1 17 which is in permissible limits 3 3 simulation of nitrogen uptake for paddy under surface drip irrigation a nitrogen schedule was developed by matching the nitrogen uptake curve fig 15 for paddy the developed schedule is shown in table 5 simulation was done from 11th day onwards visual interpretation of water and nutrient movement with respect to particular time is possible here n transformation and its uptake accumulation in soil leaching losses and loss to the atmosphere were calculated for every ten days interval table 6 for example on 50th day nitrogen uptake as urea ammonium and nitrate were 3 40 kg ha 1 7 51 kg ha 1 and 1 31 kg ha 1 respectively total uptake was 12 21 kg n ha 1 n accumulation in the root zone as urea ammonium and nitrate were 0 01 kg ha 1 59 98 kg ha 1 26 67 kg ha 1 respectively total of 86 66 kg ha 1 of nitrogen was accumulated in the root zone leaching loss in the form of urea ammonium and nitrate were 0 kg ha 1 0 02 kg ha 1 7 25 kg ha 1 respectively in total 7 26 kg ha 1 was leached between 40 and 50 days interval n loss as ammonia was 45 59 kg ha 1 from this table overall nitrogen balance was arrived and presented fig 16 3 4 nitrogen balance obtained from 11 day to 120 days of simulation period 400 kg n was supplied as input 21 15 kg of n as urea 5 3 51 82 kg as ammonium 13 34 and 9 91 kg as nitrate 2 16 were taken by roots nitrogen use efficiency by simulation was 20 8 volatilization loss of ammonia to the atmosphere was 263 73 kg n 66 0 zhu et al 2004 and li et al 2008 reported that the n losses through ammonia volatilization in the transplanted rice fields were about 18 6 38 7 and 9 6 33 7 of the total n fertilizer respectively increase in soil temperature in unsaturated soil condition favoured high volatilization loss of nitrogen as ammonia in the present research at the end of 120 days simulation urea stored in the soil was near zero n stored in the form of ammonium was 3 59 kg 0 9 and n stored in the form of nitrate was 5 73 kg 1 44 urea n leaching during the crop period was insignificant ammonical n leaching was 2 77 kg 0 69 nitrate n leaching was 41 12 kg 10 31 total mass balance error for simulation was 2 07 and it is considered as permissible spatial distribution of urea concentration on different days is shown in fig 17 urea distribution in horizontal direction is about 27 cm and its vertical distribution into the soil is almost 11 25 cm in depth there was no trace of urea concentration in the soil after 58 days as the urea application was stopped on the 56th day spatial distribution of ammonium concentration on different days of simulation is shown in fig 18 ammonium in the rootzone increased continuously up to 31st day and after that due to high plant ammonium uptake concentration in the root zone got reduced ammonium was not available from 80th day as all the available ammonium was taken up by plant and there were also leaching losses after 70th day application of urea was stopped after 56th day of sowing so availability of ammonium for plants got reduced spatial distribution of nitrate on different days of simulation is shown in fig 19 nitrate in the root zone increased continuously up to 21st day it was observed that after 32nd day considerable leaching loss of nitrates occurred 3 5 irrigation during field experiment meteorological parameters observed during the crop growing period december 2017 to april 2018 are shown in fig 20 average minimum and maximum temperatures recorded were 20 3 c and 30 4 c respectively average relative humidity recorded was 74 4 first five days 29 11 2017 to 3 12 2017 there was a total rainfall of 91 6 mm in which 40 mm was considered as effective rainfall so no irrigation water was supplied till 4 das from 5th to 10th day 10 mm of irrigation water was supplied for germination of paddy from 11th day to 110th day daily irrigation water supplied as per etc calculation and was 615 mm totally 655 mm of water was supplied to paddy crop from 1 to 110 days 3 6 growth and yield parameters observed from paddy crop the effects of simulated nitrogen schedule on growth and yield parameters were recorded table 7 plant height of paddy was observed as 81 50 cm which was 11 10 cm lower than the reported literature value of 92 60 cm for ponded irrigation this may be due to continuous unsaturated condition which might have lowered the plant height observed values for other parameters are listed in table 7 average paddy yield of co51 variety is 6 62 t ha 1 it was recorded as 3 94 t ha 1 in this field trial reduced 1000 grain weight and higher number of unfilled grains reduced the paddy grain yield in the unsaturated field condition water use efficiency of 6 02 kg ha 1mm 1 table 8 was obtained in surface drip irrigation treatment soman et al 2018 recorded the highest water use efficiency of 17 1 kg ha 1mm 1 in drip irrigation for paddy crop compared with other methods of irrigation nitrogen use efficiency of 9 85 kg kg 1 of n was obtained in this experiment 3 7 evaluation of simulated nitrogen uptake through plant nitrogen uptake fig 21 shows the simulated and observed nitrogen uptakes it can be seen from the graph that simulated total n uptake 97 88 kg n ha 1 and the observed total n uptake 104 04 kg n ha 1 at the end of the crop season for the scheduled nitrogen treatment matches closely well simulated and observed total nitrogen fairly matches well above the need curve of the nitrogen which was taken from the literature this is an indication that the simulation model developed is a valid model for simulating n uptake for drip fertigated paddy crop 4 summary and conclusions the objective of this work was to develop nitrogen schedule for paddy under surface drip irrigation system hydrus 2d software was used numerically to simulate nitrogen transport from the simulation various fluxes of urea ammonium and nitrate were quantified by using the quantified fluxes of nitrogen a schedule

10068,a robust soil water system is essential for achieving most of the sustainable development goals of united nations systems approach is essential to keep the soil water system to derive sustainable benefits prevention is better than cure hence accurate prediction of the likely results of our action on soil water system is needed hydrus is one of the handy tools for simulating root zone under drip irrigation to derive best management practices for water and nutrient application hydrus is parameter intensive software hence mostly there is a tendency to use typical values of parameters available in the literature for modelling in this research work we generated data for hydrus by intensive field experimentation to improve the reliability of modelling the first order rate constants of urea ammonium nitrate reactions were obtained by field experimentation hydrus was used numerically to simulate nitrogen transport for paddy crop under drip irrigation from the simulation various fluxes of urea ammonium and nitrate were quantified to develop a n fertigation schedule for entire crop duration the fertigation schedule was implemented by raising a paddy crop and evaluation

zone modelling fertigation paddy 1 introduction fifteenth goal of sustainable development goals sdg of united nations un envisions to combat desertification restore degraded land and soil including land affected by desertification drought and floods and strive to achieve a land degradation neutral world by the year 2030 land degradation neutrality ldn is a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems administrators and researchers advocate the systems approach but while implementation systems are impoverished while achieving goals and again restoration is attempted with a very huge cost also all the systems approach gets weakened when the integrated approach encompasses too many subsystems therefore a paradigm shift in the systems approach would help if the function of the system follows the system s possibilities in which the boundary conditions for sustainable use of the system lead the permissible land use and management options keesstra et al 2018 a robust soil water system is essential for achieving most of the sustainable development goals sdg to achieve the sdgs an increase in pressure on land is to be expected agriculture management can determine the fate of soils and thus the sustainability of human society as well as the earth system because agriculture determines the rates of the processes involved in soil the need for food security that is emphasized in the first three sdgs which target the role of soil and its fertility in order to increase agricultural productivity in areas of high population growth rate montanarella and lobos alva 2015 efficiency of nutrient and water management practices depends on soil management good agricultural practices including soil nutrient and water management lead to better crop productivity and hence profitable farming scheduling and methods of n application play a vital role in crop productivity hammad et al 2017 most of the farmers in developing countries are not well aware of the water and nutrient requirements for optimum yield responsibility lies on the shoulders of researchers to provide farmers with the information that enables them to make informed choices to meet un sdgs especially those relating to sustainable use of soil and water for food security agriculture amounts to 92 of the globe s freshwater use far ahead of industrial and domestic usage hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 agriculture consumes 80 of available fresh water in india in that paddy alone consumes 42 of available water tyagi et al 2000 decreasing fresh water resources and increasing demand for rice due to population growth leads to the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies for rice by adopting drip irrigation 40 50 of water applied for paddy can be saved sidhu et al 2019 in this regard modelling the dynamics of water and nutrient movement in root zone has gained a lot of impetus in this decade the developments in the hydrus simunek et al 2016 have attracted researchers towards modelling and field experimentations to develop strategies to efficiently manage water and nutrients hydrus simunek et al 1999 is a parameter intensive model which needs input data such as root characteristics water uptake pattern urea ammonium nitrate reaction rate data and unsaturated hydraulic characteristics of the soil the accuracy of the model results predominantly depends on the quality of the input data in majority of the literature reported typical values of urea ammonium nitrate reaction rate constants were used in the modelling process similarly the root water uptake parameters were used by many researchers by giving the data of maximum root spread and maximum root density ravikumar et al 2011 azad et al 2019 though hydrus offers accurate representation of the dynamics of water and nutrient transport in the root zone if unverified values in the field are used to simulate then results are bound to be less reliable hence research in the application of hydrus for fertigation scheduling should be directed towards finding the values of the parameters right in the field vrugt et al 2001a 2001b found out the root water uptake parameters by inverse methods using hydrus from a set of soil moisture data it should be noted that the inverse mode for finding rwu parameters in hydrus is still not available for the hydrus software package users for estimating rwu parameters using hydrus an additional code ought to be added with the help of the hydrus developers hupet et al 2002 2003 extensively researched in finding the root water uptake parameters they studied the issues such as non uniqueness instability and uncertainty in determining rwu and soil parameters by inverse methods for vertical one dimension in order to overcome the problem of instability both rwu and soil parameters have to be found out simultaneously however they reported that non uniqueness problem gets introduced for the medium fine textured soils when both soil and rwu parameters are estimated simultaneously angaleeswari and ravikumar 2019 developed an inverse methodology to find out root water uptake parameters which does not suffer from instability and demonstrated the methodology for paddy crop under drip irrigation in the present work input data for hydrus was obtained by an extensive field experimentation followed by relevant analytical work using this data an optimal schedule of nitrogen was developed for paddy crop by simulation of the water urea ammonium and nitrate movements in the vadose zone and verification of the nitrogen schedule was done by planting a paddy crop the root water uptake parameters were used from angaleeswari and ravikumar 2019 which was the same field in which this research was carried out the urea ammonium nitrate reaction rate constants were experimentally found out right in the field to represent the climate and soil characteristics the variably saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters were also found out by conducting a double ring infiltrometer test in the field combined with application of hydrus model in inverse mode by far no research has been reported in the literature where in application of hydrus for developing fertigation schedule by conducting maximum extent of field experimentation as our work presented here hence the experiences of our research are presented here 2 materials and methods 2 1 urea reactions in soil urea is the primary nitrogen fertilizer used by farmers for almost all crops urea easily dissolves in water when urea dissolves in water it gets converted into ammonium by hydrolysis process part of this ammonium gets volatilized into ammonia and lost into the atmosphere part of ammonium is taken up by plants the ammonium that has not taken up by plants converts into nitrate by nitrification process a part of nitrate is taken up by plants remaining nitrate is leached out of the root zone and reaches the ground water for proper scheduling of nitrogen fertilizer these losses need to be calculated conversion of urea into ammonium ammonia and nitrate depends on the reaction rate constants fig 1 mineralization gains of nitrogen were neglected in this study 2 2 coupled water flow and solute transport equations the hydrus 2d model uses the two dimensional form of richards equation to describe transient water flow in homogeneous isotropic and unsaturated soils 1 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h s h where θ is the volumetric water content cm3cm 3 t is time d k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm day 1 h is the pressure head cm x and z are horizontal and vertical spatial coordinates cm respectively of the simulated soil domain and s h is a sink term accounting for plant root water uptake d 1 soil hydraulic variables were found by adopting van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 the solute transport equation solved for each chemical species is as follows for urea 2 θ c 1 t θ d c 1 q c 1 μ a θ c 1 s w c 1 for ammonium 3 θ c 2 t ρ s 2 t θ d c 2 q c 2 μ v θ c 2 μ n θ c 2 μ a θ c 1 s w c 2 for nitrate 4 θ c 3 t θ d c 3 q c 3 μ n θ c 2 s w c 3 where ci is the liquid phase concentration of the chemical species i subscripts 1 2 and 3 represent urea ammonium and nitrate respectively g cm 3 d is the dispersion coefficient tensor cm2 day 1 q is the volumetric flux density cm day 1 ρ is the bulk density of the soil g cm 3 s2 is the adsorbed concentration of ammonium g g 1 the relationship between ammonium in solution c2 and adsorbed s2 is described as follows 5 s 2 k d c 2 where kd is the distribution coefficient for ammonium cm3g 1 eqs 2 4 and 5 are coupled equations that are solved sequentially solution of eq 1 provides the spatial and temporal distributions of water content θ the root water uptake distribution in the soil sw is obtained by solving eq 1 the reaction rate constants µa µ v and µn and the distribution coefficient for ammonium kd are concentration independent when solving eqs 2 5 the distributions of θ and sw are known and the unknowns are the solute concentrations namely concentrations of urea c1 ammonium c2 and nitrate c3 respectively the first order reaction term representing nitrification of urea to ammonium µa acts as sink in eq 2 and as source in eq 3 similarly the first order reaction term representing nitrification of ammonium to nitrate µn acts as sink in eq 3 and as source in eq 4 the last terms in eqs 2 4 are the products of root water uptake sw and concentrations of respective species and hence represent the passive uptake of urea ammonium and nitrate respectively 2 3 root water uptake the sink term sw represents the volume of water removed per unit time from a unit volume of soil due to plant water uptake the water stress is accounted using the model by feddes et al 1978 which is implemented in hydrus 6 s w h h s p where h is the soil water pressure head cm α h is the water stress response function which varies between 0 and 1 and sp is the potential root water uptake rate d 1 the potential root water uptake rate is non uniformly distributed within the root zone 7 s p b x z s t t p where b x z is the normalized root water uptake distribution in the vertical x z plane cm 2 st is the length of the soil surface associated with transpiration cm and tp is the potential transpiration rate cm d 1 2 4 modelled transport domain the crop row served by one drip irrigation lateral pipe is called as a paired row one lateral pipe per two crop rows was used crop geometry adopted is shown in fig 2 the distance between the crop rows within a pair is 20 cm and the spacing between the two pairs is 40 cm the plants within a row are spaced at 10 cm distance distance between the two successive laterals is 60 cm dripper discharge was 4l h 1 water movements from dripper are assumed as symmetric in both directions of the lateral along the x direction therefore only one half of the water distribution from the lateral pipe was considered for simulation modelled two dimensional transport domain was a rectangle with 30 cm wide and 45 cm deep as shown in fig 3 paddy plant was at 10 cm away from the top left boundary 2 5 boundary conditions for water flow a time variable flux boundary condition was applied at the left section of the soil surface to represent drip irrigation a dripper of 4l h 1 discharge rate was operated on the field and it was found that the ponding width around the dripper was 20 cm hence the length of variable flux boundary was 20 cm the variable flux boundary condition was switched to atmospheric boundary condition during the period of non irrigation the remaining 10 cm on the soil surface was given as atmospheric boundary condition no flow boundary conditions were applied to the sides of the flow domain bottom boundary was assumed as free drainage boundary with a unit hydraulic gradient 2 6 boundary conditions for solute transport a third type cauchy or solute flux boundary condition which predicts resident concentration volume averaged of solutes urea ammonium and nitrate within the simulation domain was used to represent the variable influx solute boundary 2 7 initial conditions for the simulation domain the soil at the start of the simulation was assumed dry and the initial pressure head was given as 300 cm and the initial solute concentration of all the solutes was assumed as zero we used an earlier version of hydrus 2d in which the root zone is assumed as a static one throughout the simulation period but in reality the root zone gradually increases as the crop grows root growth for the period was accounted by dividing the growth period into four sub periods 11 30 31 60 61 90 and 91 120 days the root depth and width in each of the successive sub periods were increased and within each sub period the root zone was assumed as static and non growing when the simulation model was run for the second sub period the final state of domain conditions of the first period simulation run was used as initial condition 2 8 root water uptake parameters hydrus distributes the root water uptake according to vrugt et al 2001a 8 b x z 1 x x m 1 z z m e p x x m x x p z z m z z where b x z is the normalized root water uptake distribution in the vertical x z plane cm 2 xm and zm are the maximum width and depth of the root zone cm respectively x and z are the location of the maximum root water uptake in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively px and pz are the empirical parameters root water uptake parameters table 1 used for simulation was adopted from angaleeswari and ravikumar 2019 these parameters were found out by inverse modelling and nonlinear optimization of estimated root water uptake distribution from the field observed soil moisture variation under drip irrigated paddy crop they found the parameters for every ten days time interval starting from 40th day after sowing to 110th day after sowing average values of root water uptake parameters calculated for simulation duration was used in eq 8 for the root water uptake parameters data used graphical root water uptake distribution is shown in fig 4 2 9 root water uptake reduction parameters root water uptake reduction parameters represent different pressure head values that affect the root water uptake in the soil the water uptake was assumed to be zero close to saturation fig 5 water uptake was considered as optimal between pressure heads h2 and h3 whereas for pressure head between h3 and h4 water uptake decreases linearly with h values of root water uptake reduction parameters used in the study were adopted from jyotiprava dash et al 2014 2 10 hydraulic conductivity by inverse modelling unsaturated hydraulic conductivity parameters were estimated using inverse modeling hydrus 1d of cumulative infiltration data from double ring infiltrometer the optimal parameter vector ks θs θr α n was found out by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between the observed and simulated cumulative depth of infiltration into the soil at different time periods by inverse modelling namitha and ravikumar 2017 running the hydrus 1d in inverse mode for the observed data of infiltration experiment yielded final estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters table 2 fig 6 shows the comparison of the observed cumulative infiltration depth and the simulated infiltration depth it can be seen that the simulated values and observed values fit very well 2 11 urea reaction rate constants the governing equations for urea reactions in soil when dispersion and advection are neglected are as follows for urea 9 θ c 1 t μ a θ c 1 for ammonium 10 θ c 2 t ρ s 2 t μ v θ c 2 μ n θ c 2 μ a θ c 1 for nitrate 11 θ c 3 t μ n θ c 2 integral equation for eq 9 if the soil moisture content is maintained constant is as follows 12 c1 t c1 0 e μa t eq 10 was expressed in explicit finite difference form as follows 13 θ c 2 t δt θ c 2 t δt 1 ρ k d θ μ v μ n θ c 2 t μ a θ c 1 0 e μ a t eq 13 was solved with an appropriate time step so that the results did not show oscillation a time step of half an hour was found to give satisfactory solution ammonium volatilized avt from the experiment was found out from the following equation 14 av t 0 t μ v θ c 2 dt where avt is the cumulative ammonium volatilized till time t to estimate the values of reaction rate constants using eqs 12 14 bolado et al 2005 devised a methodology and it was adopted in the present work this method involved a laboratory experiment in which only ammonia evolved was continuously monitored and from the data of cumulative ammonia evolved inverse modelling was done to estimate reaction rate constants 2 12 field experiment for estimation of urea reaction rate constants experiment was carried out in 500 ml of glass bottles bottles were arranged as shown in fig 7 there was a diaphragm pump to force the air into bottles b1 is the safety trap to prevent any reflux of liquid in case of system failure the safety trap is followed by bottle b2 containing distilled water for humidification of the air it is followed by bottle b3 containing boric acid to absorb the ammonium that may be present in the inlet air it is followed by bottles containing soils treated with urea b4 b5 b6 b7 the air exiting from bottles containing soil with urea was passed through 2 boric acid solution in b8 and b9 bottles in order to collect the volatilized ammonium emission of volatilized ammonia was determined by periodic titration of the boric acid solution collected from b8 and b9 bottles against 0 1 n h2so4 the experimental setup is kept under field capacity for unsaturated conditions fig 7 and 8 the experiment was carried out from 22nd may to 21st june 2017 the soil is sandy loam with a bulk density of 1 58 gm cm 3 and volumetric moisture content was maintained at field capacity 0 29 cm3 cm 3 the soil temperature readings were recorded at 9 30 am and 2 30 pm fig 9 shows the average soil temperature variation 38 0 43 5 c observed during the experiment period the initial concentration of urea n in the soil was taken as 20 9 mg cm 3 which corresponded to a dose of 7 5 g of urea per 750 g of soil fig 10 shows the cumulative ammonia evolved from the observations of cumulative ammonia evolved the urea reaction rate values were estimated by inverse modelling using a software analytical solver platform which is an add on extension of ms excel th objective function to be minimized is sum of squared deviations was minimum from the values of ammonia evolved from the experiment to the estimated values of ammonia evolved by calculating using the eqs 12 14 sequentially for every time step table 3 when the maximum and minimum values of urea reaction rate constants are specified with in the software the software does the search of optimal set of reaction rate constants for which the sum of squared deviations was minimum there is no guarantee that global optimum solution is achieved but many advanced search engines with in the software provides most likely global optimum solutions 2 13 dispersivity values for the soil the dispersivity reflects the degree of mechanical mixing of solutes caused by variations in water velocity the longitudinal dispersivity in a laboratory soil column was determined using the inversion of advection dispersion equation by namitha and ravikumar 2018 for the same soil in which the field experiments were carried out the longitudinal dispersivity was found to be 1 7 cm transverse dispersivity was taken as one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity hanson et al 2006 2 14 irrigation irrigation was given as depth of water applied per unit time constant flux on the time variable flux boundary fig 3 the duration of irrigation was calculated by using the following equations 15 application rate per unit area cm h 1 emitter discharge cm 3 h 1 lateral spacing cm emitter spacing cm 16 d u r a t i o n o f i r r i g a t i o n h e t c c m r a i n f a l l c m a p p l i c a t i o n r a t e c m h 1 it was assumed that rainfall on any day occurred before irrigation is given therefore effective rainfall on any day was equal to etc when rainfall was greater than the etc of any day if the rainfall was less than etc the total rainfall depth was taken as effective rainfall daily irrigation was given from 1 to 110 days from 111 120 days irrigation was not given as it is the conventional practice to allow maturity of the crop 2 15 water flux in hydrus for irrigation irrigation water applied was given in hydrus software as constant flux the flux calculation for surface drip irrigation is presented as below azad et al 2019 17 c o n s t a n t f l u x c m d 1 q f l o w r a t e c m 3 d 1 ponded a r e a c m 2 q a q 2 w l q constant

evaporation and transpiration hydrus requires potential evaporation and potential transpiration fluxes as input values in daily time step meteorological parameters of the study area for seven years

ep and potential transpiration tp using crop leaf area index lai as given by ritchie 1972 19 e p et c e k gr lai 20 t p et c e p here kgr is an extension coefficient for global solar radiation its value was taken as 0 3 for the rice crop phogat et al 2010 lai of rice was calculated as 1 5 for 11 20 days 2 34 for 21 30 days 3 5 for 31 40 days 4 3 for 41 60 days and 6 for 61 120 days estimated potential evaporation and potential transpiration is shown in fig 11 2 17 fertigation for developing fertigation schedule nitrogen uptake curve for paddy was taken from juan and pablo 2013 and is shown in fig 12 from the curve n uptake required for the total crop period was found as 90 kg ha 1 from the uptake curve nitrogen uptake rate can be observed to be increasing up to 70 days and after that there is no significant amount of nitrogen uptake in this study the total crop period was taken as 120 days the first 10 days after sowing was considered as germination period so simulation was done from the 11th day after sowing das an optimal nitrogen schedule derived from simulation is the one which has the simulated nitrogen uptake curve which matches the target nitrogen uptake curve the final optimal uptake curve was derived by trial and error the main advantage of this method of fertigation scheduling is matching the nutrient requirement to the field requirement of the crop here soil type initial moisture content initial concentration of solutes could also be considered to develop the fertigation schedule 2 18 field verification of developed nitrogen schedule the developed nitrogen schedule for paddy under surface drip irrigation was verified for its applicability through field trial planting was done on 29 11 2017 for nutrition supply nitrogen was supplied as per the simulated schedule table 5 in the form of urea 50 kg ha 1 of phosphorous in the form of single super phosphate was applied as basal and 148 2 kg ha 1 of potassium as muriate of potash was applied with irrigation water as per recommendations for paddy crop under drip irrigation jainart www jains com timely weeding and insecticides spray were done to protect the crop from external competition for nutrition effect of simulated nitrogen schedule on growth and yield parameters like plant height number of tillers per square meter number of productive tillers per square meter 1000 grain weight number of filled grains per plant number of unfilled grains per plant paddy grain yield and paddy straw yield were recorded from four plants average value from the plant sample analysis taken on 80th and 120th days after sowing observed nitrogen uptake was calculated through lab analysis humphries 1956 and compared with the simulated nitrogen uptake 21 n u t r i e n t u p t a k e k g h a 1 p e r c

volatilized ammonia after fitting reaction rate constants and experimental ammonia in reaction rate constant experiment are shown in fig 13 the value of estimated and experimental volatilized ammonia matched well reaction rate constants for urea obtained from the experiments were compared with the available literature values table 4 urea hydrolysis rate constant was found to be higher in unsaturated soil condition when compared to the ponded condition distribution coefficient kd was higher in ponded condition while compared with unsaturated soil condition ammonia volatilization is higher in unsaturated soil condition higher temperature in unsaturated condition caused increase in volatilization loss anaerobic condition favoured nitrification process and caused higher value of nitrification coefficient under ponded conditions 3 2 water balance for 11 120 days of simulation validation of the hydrus model results were done by doing water balance and nitrogen balance the simulation results of water flow under surface drip irrigation are given below obtained overall water balance from the model results is shown in fig 14 mass balance error was observed as 1 17 which is in permissible limits 3 3 simulation of nitrogen uptake for paddy under surface drip irrigation a nitrogen schedule was developed by matching the nitrogen uptake curve fig 15 for paddy the developed schedule is shown in table 5 simulation was done from 11th day onwards visual interpretation of water and nutrient movement with respect to particular time is possible here n transformation and its uptake accumulation in soil leaching losses and loss to the atmosphere were calculated for every ten days interval table 6 for example on 50th day nitrogen uptake as urea ammonium and nitrate were 3 40 kg ha 1 7 51 kg ha 1 and 1 31 kg ha 1 respectively total uptake was 12 21 kg n ha 1 n accumulation in the root zone as urea ammonium and nitrate were 0 01 kg ha 1 59 98 kg ha 1 26 67 kg ha 1 respectively total of 86 66 kg ha 1 of nitrogen was accumulated in the root zone leaching loss in the form of urea ammonium and nitrate were 0 kg ha 1 0 02 kg ha 1 7 25 kg ha 1 respectively in total 7 26 kg ha 1 was leached between 40 and 50 days interval n loss as ammonia was 45 59 kg ha 1 from this table overall nitrogen balance was arrived and presented fig 16 3 4 nitrogen balance obtained from 11 day to 120 days of simulation period 400 kg n was supplied as input 21 15 kg of n as urea 5 3 51 82 kg as ammonium 13 34 and 9 91 kg as nitrate 2 16 were taken by roots nitrogen use efficiency by simulation was 20 8 volatilization loss of ammonia to the atmosphere was 263 73 kg n 66 0 zhu et al 2004 and li et al 2008 reported that the n losses through ammonia volatilization in the transplanted rice fields were about 18 6 38 7 and 9 6 33 7 of the total n fertilizer respectively increase in soil temperature in unsaturated soil condition favoured high volatilization loss of nitrogen as ammonia in the present research at the end of 120 days simulation urea stored in the soil was near zero n stored in the form of ammonium was 3 59 kg 0 9 and n stored in the form of nitrate was 5 73 kg 1 44 urea n leaching during the crop period was insignificant ammonical n leaching was 2 77 kg 0 69 nitrate n leaching was 41 12 kg 10 31 total mass balance error for simulation was 2 07 and it is considered as permissible spatial distribution of urea concentration on different days is shown in fig 17 urea distribution in horizontal direction is about 27 cm and its vertical distribution into the soil is almost 11 25 cm in depth there was no trace of urea concentration in the soil after 58 days as the urea application was stopped on the 56th day spatial distribution of ammonium concentration on different days of simulation is shown in fig 18 ammonium in the rootzone increased continuously up to 31st day and after that due to high plant ammonium uptake concentration in the root zone got reduced ammonium was not available from 80th day as all the available ammonium was taken up by plant and there were also leaching losses after 70th day application of urea was stopped after 56th day of sowing so availability of ammonium for plants got reduced spatial distribution of nitrate on different days of simulation is shown in fig 19 nitrate in the root zone increased continuously up to 21st day it was observed that after 32nd day considerable leaching loss of nitrates occurred 3 5 irrigation during field experiment meteorological parameters observed during the crop growing period december 2017 to april 2018 are shown in fig 20 average minimum and maximum temperatures recorded were 20 3 c and 30 4 c respectively average relative humidity recorded was 74 4 first five days 29 11 2017 to 3 12 2017 there was a total rainfall of 91 6 mm in which 40 mm was considered as effective rainfall so no irrigation water was supplied till 4 das from 5th to 10th day 10 mm of irrigation water was supplied for germination of paddy from 11th day to 110th day daily irrigation water supplied as per etc calculation and was 615 mm totally 655 mm of water was supplied to paddy crop from 1 to 110 days 3 6 growth and yield parameters observed from paddy crop the effects of simulated nitrogen schedule on growth and yield parameters were recorded table 7 plant height of paddy was observed as 81 50 cm which was 11 10 cm lower than the reported literature value of 92 60 cm for ponded irrigation this may be due to continuous unsaturated condition which might have lowered the plant height observed values for other parameters are listed in table 7 average paddy yield of co51 variety is 6 62 t ha 1 it was recorded as 3 94 t ha 1 in this field trial reduced 1000 grain weight and higher number of unfilled grains reduced the paddy grain yield in the unsaturated field condition water use efficiency of 6 02 kg ha 1mm 1 table 8 was obtained in surface drip irrigation treatment soman et al 2018 recorded the highest water use efficiency of 17 1 kg ha 1mm 1 in drip irrigation for paddy crop compared with other methods of irrigation nitrogen use efficiency of 9 85 kg kg 1 of n was obtained in this experiment 3 7 evaluation of simulated nitrogen uptake through plant nitrogen uptake fig 21 shows the simulated and observed nitrogen uptakes it can be seen from the graph that simulated total n uptake 97 88 kg n ha 1 and the observed total n uptake 104 04 kg n ha 1 at the end of the crop season for the scheduled nitrogen treatment matches closely well simulated and observed total nitrogen fairly matches well above the need curve of the nitrogen which was taken from the literature this is an indication that the simulation model developed is a valid model for simulating n uptake for drip fertigated paddy crop 4 summary and conclusions the objective of this work was to develop nitrogen schedule for paddy under surface drip irrigation system hydrus 2d software was used numerically to simulate nitrogen transport from the simulation various fluxes of urea ammonium and nitrate were quantified by using the quantified fluxes of nitrogen a schedule was developed through trial and error by matching the nitrogen uptake from the simulation model with the nitrogen assimilation curve taken from the literature evaluation of this nitrogen schedule was done through estimation of n assimilation of crop by doing plant sample analysis the simulated values of nitrogen uptake were in good agreement with the observed values of nitrogen uptake application

10069,root water uptake plays an important role in plant growth and the water cycle in ecosystems and it is greatly affected by the morphology and spatial distribution of the roots the ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system rfrh is an effective strategy in semi arid regions but the mechanism of spring maize root water uptake remains unclear therefore we conducted a two year experiment in a semi arid region of northwestern china to study the soil water content swc spring maize root morphology and spatial distribution and water uptake in different root zones using the 18 oxygen stable isotope δ18o under rfrh the root zones were investigated in three locations around a maize plant 1 ridge rf r 2 border of the ridge and furrow rf b and 3 furrow rf f the results showed that rfrh changed the symmetrical soil water distribution in the maize rows and significantly increased the swc in rf f especially in the shallow soil profile 0 60 cm which where the enhanced root growth in the shallower soil layers 0 40 cm under rf f and the roots reached deeper into the soil under rf r the roots reached deeper to absorb water as they developed vertically in the advanced of growth stage the contributions of different soil layers to the total soil water uptake in the root zone exhibited a similar trend to the root proportion according to δ18o analysis in the filling stage the maize roots under rf r and rf b acquired 64 1 and 65 8 of the water from the 40 60 cm layer in 2018 respectively and 74 5 and 65 5 in 2019 whereas the amounts under rf f were 49 9 and 27 6 from the 40 60 cm layer and 30 and 53 9 from the 20 40 cm layer in 2018 and 2019 thus spring maize root water uptake was positively correlated with the root distribution and the roots under the furrow absorbed more water from the shallower soil layers than the ridge and less from the deeper soil layers than the ridge keywords mechanism ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system root water uptake spring maize stable oxygen isotope 1 introduction many recent studies have focused on the water cycle in ecosystems because of the water scarcity caused by irrational anthropogenic activities and climate change hirmas et al 2018 the root water absorption is an important part of the water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum asbjornsen et al 2007a and it is also a crucial physiological activity in the plant growth and development process ristova and busch 2014 jha et al 2017 thus it is of great significance to study the root water uptake process and stable isotope analysis is an effective and feasible method chimner and cooper 2004 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses have been used widely in natural ecosystems to identify the sources of water used by plants and to determine the soil depths where the plant roots acquire water dawson and ehleringer 1998 theoretically no stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic fractions are present in the process of plant root water uptake so the isotopic composition of water in the plant xylem can be regarded as a mixture of the isotopic values in water from various sources dawson and ehleringer 1991 ehleringer and dawson 1992 therefore we can infer the water sources used by plants by comparing the isotopic compositions of water in the xylem and potential water sources wu et al 2016 phillips and gregg 2003 proposed the isosource model based on the multi source mass balance principle to calculate the contribution of each potential water source to the water uptake by a plant various studies have demonstrated that the distributions of d and 18o are highly uniform in various water samples wang et al 2010 2019a however the difference in the relative mass between 18o and 16o is lower than that between d and h so the fractionation of oxygen isotopes is less significant than that of hydrogen isotopes lin 2013 thus stable isotope analysis has been conducted based on 18o in most previous studies wu et al 2016 in particular stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses have mainly been used to explore the water resources utilized by trees in woodland whereas they have rarely been applied in field crops dai et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 as a most important organ to absorb water the root system plays a crucial role in crop growth and productivity ristova and busch 2014 it is also an important system for transferring material and information between the aboveground and belowground parts of crops wang et al 2018 the morphological characteristics of the roots affect the uptake of water by crops thereby influencing growth and the yield fageria 2004 doussan et al 2006 the root length density rld and root surface area are key morphological traits for crop roots because they directly influence the capacity of the roots to absorb soil water and nutrients lynch 2011 the root dry weight is also an essential parameter used for evaluating the characteristics of roots wang et al 2018 in addition to the root morphology the temporal and spatial distributions of the root system in the soil profile significantly affect the absorption of soil water thereby affecting growth and productivity wang et al 2019b in general a deeper root system distribution is considered to optimize the absorption of water throughout the soil layer lynch 2013 previous studies have shown that the soil water characteristics have a significant individual effect on root morphology and distribution in maize peng et al 2012 wang et al 2019b roots grow deeper under non irrigated and early drought stress conditions compared with fully irrigated and late drought stress and the soil moisture directly affects the direction of growth by the root system meinzer et al 2006 liu et al 2011 sun et al 2011 the water absorption capacity and potential depend on the morphology and spatial distribution of the roots which are affected the by soil water status wang et al 2019b therefore quantitative descriptions of the root morphology and distribution as well as the soil water content swc in different root zones are essential for root water absorption analysis the ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system rfrh is an important technique in the rain fed agricultural area of the loess plateau region in northwestern china where the interannual variation in precipitation is large and the annual rainfall ranges from 250 to 600 mm ren et al 2008 rfrh is effective for collecting the surface runoff to maximize the use of light rain and reduce ineffective evaporation thereby improving the water use efficiency and crop production wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 similar results were obtained in studies of maize potato wheat millet and other crops under the rfrh system where it effectively improved the soil moisture status growth of crops and the accumulation and translocation of photosynthate to enhance the harvest index and crop productivity gan et al 2013 many studies have reported the effect of rfrh on the soil water distribution in the vertical direction but the redistribution of soil water in the horizontal direction has rarely been investigated in this study we hypothesized that rfrh would significantly affect the swc in a horizontal direction with effects on the root morphology and distribution as well as soil water uptake few studies have investigated the root distribution root water uptake in different root zones and associated mechanism under rfrh therefore it is of great significance to determine the temporal and spatial distributions of the soil water and root system as well as the root water uptake under rfrh in order to provide theoretical and practical insights into crop productivity improvements therefore we conducted a two year field experiment with spring maize to measure the swc root morphological characteristics root distribution and stable oxygen isotope δ18o levels in the soil water in different root zones and the stem our main objectives were 1 to analyze the changes in the temporal and spatial distributions of the soil water under rfrh 2 to quantify the morphological characteristics and temporal and spatial distributions of the roots 3 to determine the temporal and spatial water uptake characteristics in spring maize and 4 to clarify the mechanism of maize water uptake under the rfrh system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted from april to october during 2018 and 2019 in pengyang county ningxia hui autonomous region northwestern china 35 51 n 106 47 e 1695 m above sea level which is a representative semiarid region of the loess plateau with hilly topography the site is characterized by a warm temperate climate with a mean annual temperature of 8 c annual accumulated sunshine amount of 2518 h and mean annual precipitation of 430 mm over the last 40 years the total precipitation levels in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons were 567 6 mm and 618 9 mm respectively and the daily average air temperatures were 18 1 c and 16 9 c the soil at the study site was classified as calcic cambisol according to fao 2002 at the experimental site the soil in the 0 40 cm layer had a bulk density of 1 36 g cm 3 organic carbon content of 7 35 g kg 1 total nitrogen n content of 0 84 g kg 1 available phosphorus content of 12 32 mg kg 1 and available potassium content of 107 2 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment was conducted in the same field during 2018 and 2019 under rfrh the ridges were 60 cm wide and 15 cm high with plastic film mulch and the bare furrows were 60 cm wide maize was sown at the junction of the ridge and furrow under rfrh three root zones were tested comprising 1 rf r under the ridge 2 rf b under the border of the ridge and furrow 3 rf f in the furrow fig 1 three plots were prepared for the three replicates and each of them was 10 m long and 6 m wide in order to reduce the impacts of different plots each plot was separated by a 60 cm wide border ten days before sowing alternate ridges and furrows were established and fertilizer was broadcast over the soil in the furrow before turning over the soil with a plow finally transparent polyethylene plastic film was applied to cover the ridges fertilizer was applied at a rate of 230 kg ha 1 n and 115 kg ha 1 p2o5 using urea n 46 and di ammonium phosphate n 18 p2o5 46 0 respectively the plastic film mulch was transparent polyethylene with a thickness of 0 008 mm spring maize dafeng 30 was sown using a manually powered hole drilling machine in 5 cm deep holes at a planting density of 82 500 plants ha 1 on april 28 in 2018 and april 29 in 2019 no irrigation was applied during both experimental years and manual weeding was performed to eradicate weeds according to local management practices maize was harvested manually on october 1 2018 and october 2 2019 after harvesting the plastic film was retained to retain moisture in the soil until the next sowing season 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water at the jointing tasseling and filling stages a hand held soil ferric auger diameter 54 mm was used to collect soil samples at the three root zones rf r rf b rf f of each maize plant three representative plants were selected soil samples were collected to a soil depth of 100 cm from the horizontal level of the furrow 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layer after mixing well put about 15 20 g soil on a plastic bag then removed roots to avoid evaporation this process was carried out in an ice box placed the rootless soil into a 100 ml plastic bottle sealed with parafilm to prevent evaporation and immediately stored in another ice box to determine the soil water isotopes picked roots and remaining soil placed into plastic bags labeled according to the different sites and soil layers and take part of the soil without roots into an aluminum box to measure the swc 2 3 2 stem water maize stems were sampled from the same selected plant at the same time as the soil water samples were collected to avoid isotope fractionation due to plant transpiration we selected maize stems containing no chlorophyll located 5 cm above the soil surface and far from the leaves the stem samples were placed in a 12 ml glass bottle sealed with parafilm to prevent evaporation and stored in a refrigerator immediately the soil water penetration could not be strong during sampling so the samples were collected when there had been no precipitation for at least 3 days the stems and soil samples were collected at about 8 00 a m when the soil water profile dynamics were quite stable because the evapotranspiration was low the soil water and maize stem water were extracted using a vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica china according to the cryogenic vacuum distillation method ehleringer and osmond 1989 all of the water samples were then immediately transferred into airtight bottles and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to avoid evaporation and isotope fractionation before the isotopic analysis was conducted the δ18o levels were measured using an isoprime 100 mass spectrometer results were expressed as parts per thousand deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow precision of 0 1 2 s d was obtained for δ18o in the standard water sample the isotope compositions δ18o were calculated as follows δ r m r s 1000 where rm and rs are the 18o 16o molar ratios for the water sample and standard water v smow respectively and the analytical precision was 0 1 2 3 3 maize roots the spring maize root system was sampled at the same site as the swc and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were determined in the jointing and tasseling stages three representative plants were selected and the root system was excavated as shown in fig 1 the total length of each excavated soil block was 60 cm and the three sections were divided according to the three root zones comprising rf r rf f and rf b where the length of each part was 20 cm and the width of the soil block was 20 cm the depth of the soil block was 60 cm in the jointing stage and 80 cm in the tasseling stage and the soil block was divided into three or four layers each with a thickness of 20 cm thus each root sampling unit was a cube where the length width and height were all 20 cm each soil core section was placed into a nylon netting bag after excavation then put the corresponding removed roots which were selected when the swc and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were sampled into it the soil core section in a nylon netting bag was soaked overnight in a plastic container filled with water the next day each soil sample was poured into 0 25 mm2 mesh sieve and the roots were gently washed with tap water using a hose and nozzle until they were free of soil the mixture of living roots white color organic debris and dead roots dark color on the sieve was separated carefully gregory 1994 jia et al 2018 living roots were then arranged and floated on shallow water in a glass tray 24 cm 32 cm before obtaining an image file using a scanner epson v700 indonesia root images were analyzed to determine the root length and root surface area using winrhizo version 5 0 regent instruments inc quebec city canada the root dry weight was determined after drying at 105 c for 30 min and then drying to constant weight at 75 c 2 4 data calculation 2 4 1 swc swc was calculated as follows swc fresh soil weight dry soil weight dry soil weight 100 2 4 2 rld rld cm cm 3 was calculated as follows rld root length in sampling core soil core volume 2 4 3 root water uptake the root water uptake by maize from different root zones and its contribution to stem water was assessed using the isosource model based on the multi source mass balance model phillips et al 2005 the basic equations for the model are δ o s i 1 n f i δ o i i 1 n f i 1 where δo is the 18 oxygen isotope composition the subscripts s and i refer to the plant and water source respectively n is the total number of water sources and f is the proportion of one source relative to the total water used by the plant in this model the increment was set to 2 the tolerance of the sum was set to 0 01 and the uncertainty level was set to 0 2 2 5 statistical analysis the data for each sampling event were analyzed separately by analysis of variance using spss 23 0 ibm inc armonk ny usa the mean results for each treatment were compared using the least significant difference test at a probability level of 0 05 all figures were prepared using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 soil water distribution the soil water in the planting rows was distributed variously on both sides of the maize plants under rfrh in all growth stages during both years the swc values varied in rf r rf b and rf f near the maize under rfrh in the 0 60 cm soil layer whereas there were no significant differences in the 60 100 cm layer fig 2 in the jointing tasseling and filling stages the swc values in rf f in the 0 60 cm soil profiles were 20 65 6 42 and 9 94 higher than those in rf r and 1 90 4 16 and 4 44 higher than those in rf b during 2018 as well as 16 78 6 90 and 8 59 higher than those in rf r and 3 27 3 20 and 7 95 higher than those in rf b during 2019 swc was significantly higher in rf b than rf r only in the jointing stage i e 18 48 and 13 06 higher during 2018 and 2019 respectively thus rfrh changed the symmetrical distribution of the soil water on both sides of the maize plants 3 2 maize root morphology and distribution rld decreased gradually with the depth of the soil layer and the root system was mostly distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer followed by 20 40 cm and the 40 60 cm layer contained only a small amount of the root system distribution figs 3 4 and 5 rld increased throughout the growth process during both study years and it varied in different zones fig 3 in each soil layer rld was significantly greater in rf b under the plant than rf r and rf f in the jointing stage the rld values in rf f in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers during 2018 were 77 5 and 46 9 higher than those in rf r respectively and 58 0 and 43 7 higher during 2019 in the tasseling stage the rld values in rf f in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers were 64 7 and 18 5 higher respectively than those in rf r during 2018 and 45 2 and 44 2 higher during 2019 in the jointing stage the rld values in rf r in the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers accounted for 76 1 20 5 and 3 4 respectively of the total rld in rf r during 2018 and 75 4 18 7 and 5 9 during 2019 and those in rf f accounted for 80 4 17 9 and 1 6 during 2018 and 78 7 17 7 and 3 6 during 2019 in the tasseling stage the rld values in rf r in the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm soil layers accounted for 63 4 25 9 8 8 and 1 9 respectively of the total rld in rf r during 2018 and 66 0 21 7 9 1 and 3 2 during 2019 and those in rf f accounted for 71 6 21 0 6 0 and 1 3 of the total rld during 2018 and 69 6 22 7 5 4 and 2 3 during 2019 the pattern was similar in 2019 compared with rf f the proportion of the rld was higher in rf r than rf f except in the 0 20 cm soil layer the root surface area and root dry weight for the soil profiles in rf r and rf f exhibited similar trends to the rld figs 4 and 5 3 3 maize root water uptake the δ18o values determined for the soil water exhibited a clear gradient distribution in the vertical profile and they were enriched in the surface soil layer fig 6 in the growth stage during both years the δ18o levels fluctuated in the soil profiles where the fluctuations were greatest in the subsoil but they decreased with the soil deepening in each growth stage during both years the δ18o values in the soil profiles in rf r rf f and rf b differed significantly in the surface layer and the difference decreased gradually with the soil layer deepened the direct inference approach is based on the theory that no fractionation of stable oxygen isotopes occurs during the uptake of water by the roots dawson and ehleringer 1991 thus the intersection of δ18o in the stem water with that in the soil water for a certain profile indicates that the maize absorb water mainly from this layer in the jointing stage during 2018 and 2019 the δ18o value in the stem water intersected with that in the soil water in the 0 20 cm layer in rf r rf f and rf b in the tasseling stage during both years the intersections occurred in the 20 40 cm layer in the filling stage during both years two intersections occurred in the 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm layers in rf r and rf b and in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers in rf f thus the main depths for root water uptake were 0 20 cm in the jointing stage 20 40 cm in the tasseling stage and 40 80 cm in rf r and rf b and 20 60 cm in rf f in the filling stage therefore roots uptake water from deeper soil layers as the growth stage advanced the multiple source mass balance method can assess all possible combinations of each water source to estimate the range of possible water contributions from a certain depth to the root water uptake based on a frequency histogram in the growth stage during both years the histogram patterns were relatively convergent at some depths whereas others were broad and diffuse fig 7 in the jointing stage during 2018 the frequency histograms for rf r rf b and rf f converged in the 0 20 cm layer whereas they were broad and diffuse at other depths the results indicated that the water uptake in the three root zones were mainly from the soil water in the 0 20 cm layer which accounted for 58 78 mean value was 71 9 of the total water uptake from rf r 78 90 mean value was 85 2 of the total water uptake from rf b and 74 86 mean value was 81 8 of the total water uptake from rf f the root water uptake depths were deeper as the growth stage advanced in the tasseling stage during 2018 the maize mainly absorbed water from the 0 20 cm soil layer followed by the 20 40 cm soil layer which accounted for 0 68 mean value was 39 2 and 0 88 mean value was 31 6 respectively of the total water uptake from rf r 4 76 mean value was 52 6 and 0 96 mean value was 25 8 of the total water uptake from rf b and 0 64 mean value was 42 3 and 0 96 mean value was 27 9 of total water uptake from rf f in the tasseling stage the contribution of the 0 20 cm soil layer to the total water uptake from rf r was lower than that from rf b and rf f whereas that in the 20 40 cm layer was higher in the filling stage during 2018 and 2019 the maize roots mainly absorbed soil water from the 40 60 cm layer in rf r and rf b which accounted for 46 90 mean value was 64 1 and 54 88 mean value was 65 8 in 2018 respectively and 64 90 mean value was 74 5 and 50 86 mean value was 65 5 during 2019 in rf f the contributions from the 40 60 cm layer were 0 88 mean value was 49 9 and 0 100 mean value was 27 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and those from the 20 40 cm layer were 0 98 mean value was 30 0 and 0 88 mean value was 53 9 during 2018 and 2019 the soil depth of root water uptake was deepened as the growth stage advanced in the different root zones the contributions of the shallower soil layers 0 20 cm layer in the jointing and tasseling stages and 20 40 cm layer in the filling stage in rf r were lower than those in rf b and rf f whereas those of the deeper layers 20 40 cm layer in the jointing and tasseling stages and 40 60 cm layer in the filling stage were higher in rf r the maize roots absorbed more water from the shallow soil in rf f the water uptake patterns in 2019 were similar to those in 2018 3 4 maize root distribution and water uptake pearson correlation analysis showed significant positive correlation between the proportion of soil water uptake and the proportion of root distribution fig 8 the proportion of soil water uptake was significantly correlated with the proportion of root length in rf r rf b and rf f at p 0 01 r 0 8717 0 9101 and 0 9187 respectively the proportion of soil water uptake showed a significant correlation with the proportion of root surface area in rf r rf b and rf f at p 0 01 r 0 8194 0 8856 and 0 9250 respectively similarly the proportion of soil water uptake also significantly correlated with the proportion of root dry weight in rf r rf b and rf f at p 0 01 r 0 8958 0 8847 and 0 9327 respectively generally the proportion of water uptake increased with the proportion of root length root surface area and root dry weight 4 discussion 4 1 soil water distribution and maize root distribution the dynamic changes in the soil water are affected by rainfall plant transpiration soil surface evaporation deep soil water leakage and lateral migration wang et al 2012 wu et al 2017 in the present study we found that swc differed on the two sides of the maize plant under rfrh where it was significantly higher in rf f than rf r by contrast the swc in the planting rows was distributed symmetrically on both sides of the maize under fp the differences in the swc were due to changes in the soil profile structure in the ridges and furrows thus infiltration and evaporation affected the entire soil surface under fp whereas they only occurred in the furrows under rfrh jiang and li 2015 used dye tracer and simulated rainfall to assess the effects of fully mulching the ridge furrow with plastic film on the rainwater distribution in the soil where the results showed that rainwater was mainly absorbed by the soil matrix of over the whole surface under traditional flat planting whereas it moved to the deeper soil profile below the furrows in the rfrh system thus the rainwater was distributed evenly and shallowly under traditional flat planting whereas it was concentrated in the furrows and distributed to a greater depth under the rfrh system in the maize growth period during both years the swc in the shallow soil layer 0 60 cm was significantly higher in rf f than rf r whereas there were no significant differences in the deep soil layers this difference was mainly due to the function and mechanism of the rfrh system where the plastic film mulched ridge concentrated the rainfall into the furrow i e the runoff from the ridge and the rainfall falling in the furrow combined in the furrow to enhance the infiltration and effectively increase the swc ghosh et al 2006 wang et al 2008 our two year study showed that the maize roots were mainly distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer followed by the 20 40 cm layer whereas few roots were distributed in the 40 60 cm layer wu et al 2016 reported that 50 80 of the maize roots were present in the 0 20 cm soil layer under field conditions a previous study of root growth and lodging resistance in maize under the rfrh system obtained similar results where the rld and root surface area density in the 0 20 cm soil layer accounted for more than 50 of the roots in all soil layers ranging from 0 to 100 cm jia et al 2018 the results were consistent in both years where the majority of the maize roots were distributed in the 0 30 cm soil layer and the root weight density decreased significantly as the soil depth increased gao et al 2014 in the present study in 2018 and 2019 the rld root surface area and root dry weight were significantly higher in the 0 40 cm soil layer in rf f than rf r whereas those in the 40 80 cm soil layer were lower in rf f than rf r figs 3 4 and 5 probably because this planting pattern changed the water distribution in the soil profile the rfrh system with film mulching can effectively channel rainwater into the crop rooting zones thereby affecting the absorption of precipitation by the roots gan et al 2013 therefore the higher swc in the 0 40 soil layer in rf f fig 2 stimulated the growth of the root system in the 0 40 cm layer whereas the lower swc in the 0 40 cm soil layer in rf r stimulated the growth of the root system deeper into the soil to absorb water in general a high swc in the planting zone will lead to the horizontally extension of the roots whereas a low swc will lead to their longitudinal extension previous studies have demonstrated that the crop root characteristics are closely related to the swc in the present study the soil water distribution was similar to the root distribution a previous study of canola in semiarid australia by kirkegaard et al 1997 also demonstrated that the rld and rooting depth were strongly related to the soil water availability similarly studies of legumes in canada showed that the rld root weight density root volume density and root diameter were positively related to the water availability liu et al 2012 a study by jiang and li 2015 indicated that the high swc region mostly matched with the main maize root zone in the rfrh system these highly consistent results may be explained by water increasing the availability of nutrients to improve the growth of the roots kumar and lal 2012 4 2 maize root water uptake and root distribution in the growth period during both years we found that the surface soil water was isotopically enriched where δ18o changed greatly in the shallow soil layers but little in the deep soil layers fig 6 this phenomenon is caused by strong evaporation in semi arid areas which has less effect on the water isotope composition in the deeper soil xu et al 2012 in the present study δ18o differed significantly in the shallow soil layers between rf r rf b and rf f these differences may have been due to the variations in evaporation with and without the film english et al 2007 or 18o redistribution due to isotope fractionation during the water infiltration process when rainwater collected in the furrows araguás araguás et al 1995 gazis and feng 2004 in the present study similar results were obtained using the direct inference approach and the frequency histogram based on the water absorption depth the lack of difference might have been due to the limitation of the direct inference approach because it can only estimate the main water uptake depth for maize and it ignores the water that can be provided by water from various soil layers at a fixed proportion the root water uptake was deeper as the growth stage advanced figs 6 and 7 this trend was similar for the root morphological characteristics and distribution figs 3 4 and 5 thereby indicating that the change in the water uptake depth could be explained by root development during the growth period zhao et al 2018 the root distribution is an important indicator of the potential water uptake coelho and or 1999 taylor and klepper 1974 also reported that the spatial distribution of the roots has an important effect on root water uptake thus the main water absorption depth for the root system gradually increased as the main root system distribution extended deeper during the entire growth stage li et al 2011 however a study in the midwestern usa showed that maize mainly obtained water from the 0 20 cm soil layer and that there was no flexibility in the water use by the roots asbjornsen et al 2007b these different water uptake modes may be explained by genetic differences in cultivars and environmental factors romero saltos et al 2005 west et al 2012 voltas et al 2015 the frequency histogram can also determine the ranges of possible contributions from different soil layers to root water uptake in the root zones in rf r rf b and rf f the contribution of the same soil layers to root water uptake differed during the maize growth stages fig 7 which could be explained by the root distribution the contribution of each soil layer to root water uptake increased with the proportion of the root system in the soil layer relative to the total root system in the root zone in the jointing and tasseling stages the 0 20 cm soil layer made the highest contribution to the root water uptake in rf b followed by rf f because the highest proportion of the root system was in the 0 20 cm soil layer according to the following trend rf b rf f rf r figs 3 4 and 5 the root system in the 20 40 cm soil layer enlarged gradually as the growth stage advanced and it played an important role in the uptake of soil water in the tasseling stage the contribution of this soil layer to the root water uptake was higher under the ridge than the furrow where the proportion of the root system in the 20 40 cm soil layer followed the trend rf b rf r rf f figs 3 4 and 5 there were significant positive correlation between the contribution of soil water to maize root and the proportion of root length density root surface area and root dry weight fig 8 a study by ma and song 2016 also indicated that the contribution of each soil layer to the uptake of water by maize was positively correlated with the proportional root distribution however some studies have indicated that the root distribution characteristics do not always match those of the water uptake thorburn and ehleringer 1995 dawson and pate 1996 due to differences among plant species and the effects of environmental factors stahl et al 2013 5 conclusion the rfrh system produced higher swc in the furrow than the ridge especially in the shallow soil profile 0 60 cm and more roots were distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer under the furrow than the ridge the uptake of water extended to greater depths as the roots developed longitudinally throughout the growth stages there were significant positive correlation between the contribution of soil water to maize root and the proportion of root distribution the contributions of shallower soil layers 0 20 cm layer in the jointing and tasseling stages and 20 40 cm layer in the filling stage to the total water uptake from rf r were lower than those from rf b and rf f whereas the contributions of the deeper soil layers 20 40 cm layer in the jointing and tasseling stages and 40 60 cm layer in the filling stage were higher therefore under rfrh the maize roots absorbed water from deeper in the soil as the growth stages advanced and more water was absorbed from the shallower soil layers and less from the deeper soil layers in rf f than rf r understanding the water uptake mechanism is important for improving the crop

10069,root water uptake plays an important role in plant growth and the water cycle in ecosystems and it is greatly affected by the morphology and spatial distribution of the roots the ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system rfrh is an effective strategy in semi arid regions but the mechanism of spring maize root water uptake remains unclear therefore we conducted a two year experiment in a semi arid region of northwestern china to study the soil water content swc spring maize root morphology and spatial distribution and water uptake in different root zones using the 18 oxygen stable isotope δ18o under rfrh the root zones were investigated in three locations around a maize plant 1 ridge rf r 2 border of the ridge and furrow rf b and 3 furrow rf f the results showed that rfrh changed the symmetrical soil water distribution in the maize rows and significantly increased the swc in rf f especially in the shallow soil profile 0 60 cm which where the enhanced root growth in the shallower soil layers 0 40 cm under rf f and the roots reached deeper into the soil under rf r the roots reached deeper to absorb water as they developed vertically in the advanced of growth stage the contributions of different soil layers to the total soil water uptake in the root zone exhibited a similar trend to the root proportion according to δ18o analysis in the filling stage the maize roots under rf r and rf b acquired 64 1 and 65 8 of the water from the 40 60 cm layer in 2018 respectively and 74 5 and 65 5 in 2019 whereas the amounts under rf f were 49 9 and 27 6 from the 40 60 cm layer and 30 and 53 9 from the 20 40 cm layer in 2018 and 2019 thus spring maize root water uptake was positively correlated with the root distribution and the roots under the furrow absorbed more water from the shallower soil layers than the ridge and less from the deeper soil layers than the ridge keywords mechanism ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system root water uptake spring maize stable oxygen isotope 1 introduction many recent studies have focused on the water cycle in ecosystems because of the water scarcity caused by irrational anthropogenic activities and climate change hirmas et al 2018 the root water absorption is an important part of the water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum asbjornsen et al 2007a and it is also a crucial physiological activity in the plant growth and development process ristova and busch 2014 jha et al 2017 thus it is of great significance to study the root water uptake process and stable isotope analysis is an effective and feasible method chimner and cooper 2004 stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses have been used widely in natural ecosystems to identify the sources of water used by plants and to determine the soil depths where the plant roots acquire water dawson and ehleringer 1998 theoretically no stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic fractions are present in the process of plant root water uptake so the isotopic composition of water in the plant xylem can be regarded as a mixture of the isotopic values in water from various sources dawson and ehleringer 1991 ehleringer and dawson 1992 therefore we can infer the water sources used by plants by comparing the isotopic compositions of water in the xylem and potential water sources wu et al 2016 phillips and gregg 2003 proposed the isosource model based on the multi source mass balance principle to calculate the contribution of each potential water source to the water uptake by a plant various studies have demonstrated that the distributions of d and 18o are highly uniform in various water samples wang et al 2010 2019a however the difference in the relative mass between 18o and 16o is lower than that between d and h so the fractionation of oxygen isotopes is less significant than that of hydrogen isotopes lin 2013 thus stable isotope analysis has been conducted based on 18o in most previous studies wu et al 2016 in particular stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses have mainly been used to explore the water resources utilized by trees in woodland whereas they have rarely been applied in field crops dai et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 as a most important organ to absorb water the root system plays a crucial role in crop growth and productivity ristova and busch 2014 it is also an important system for transferring material and information between the aboveground and belowground parts of crops wang et al 2018 the morphological characteristics of the roots affect the uptake of water by crops thereby influencing growth and the yield fageria 2004 doussan et al 2006 the root length density rld and root surface area are key morphological traits for crop roots because they directly influence the capacity of the roots to absorb soil water and nutrients lynch 2011 the root dry weight is also an essential parameter used for evaluating the characteristics of roots wang et al 2018 in addition to the root morphology the temporal and spatial distributions of the root system in the soil profile significantly affect the absorption of soil water thereby affecting growth and productivity wang et al 2019b in general a deeper root system distribution is considered to optimize the absorption of water throughout the soil layer lynch 2013 previous studies have shown that the soil water characteristics have a significant individual effect on root morphology and distribution in maize peng et al 2012 wang et al 2019b roots grow deeper under non irrigated and early drought stress conditions compared with fully irrigated and late drought stress and the soil moisture directly affects the direction of growth by the root system meinzer et al 2006 liu et al 2011 sun et al 2011 the water absorption capacity and potential depend on the morphology and spatial distribution of the roots which are affected the by soil water status wang et al 2019b therefore quantitative descriptions of the root morphology and distribution as well as the soil water content swc in different root zones are essential for root water absorption analysis the ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system rfrh is an important technique in the rain fed agricultural area of the loess plateau region in northwestern china where the interannual variation in precipitation is large and the annual rainfall ranges from 250 to 600 mm ren et al 2008 rfrh is effective for collecting the surface runoff to maximize the use of light rain and reduce ineffective evaporation thereby improving the water use efficiency and crop production wang et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 similar results were obtained in studies of maize potato wheat millet and other crops under the rfrh system where it effectively improved the soil moisture status growth of crops and the accumulation and translocation of photosynthate to enhance the harvest index and crop productivity gan et al 2013 many studies have reported the effect of rfrh on the soil water distribution in the vertical direction but the redistribution of soil water in the horizontal direction has rarely been investigated in this study we hypothesized that rfrh would significantly affect the swc in a horizontal direction with effects on the root morphology and distribution as well as soil water uptake few studies have investigated the root distribution root water uptake in different root zones and associated mechanism under rfrh therefore it is of great significance to determine the temporal and spatial distributions of the soil water and root system as well as the root water uptake under rfrh in order to provide theoretical and practical insights into crop productivity improvements therefore we conducted a two year field experiment with spring maize to measure the swc root morphological characteristics root distribution and stable oxygen isotope δ18o levels in the soil water in different root zones and the stem our main objectives were 1 to analyze the changes in the temporal and spatial distributions of the soil water under rfrh 2 to quantify the morphological characteristics and temporal and spatial distributions of the roots 3 to determine the temporal and spatial water uptake characteristics in spring maize and 4 to clarify the mechanism of maize water uptake under the rfrh system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted from april to october during 2018 and 2019 in pengyang county ningxia hui autonomous region northwestern china 35 51 n 106 47 e 1695 m above sea level which is a representative semiarid region of the loess plateau with hilly topography the site is characterized by a warm temperate climate with a mean annual temperature of 8 c annual accumulated sunshine amount of 2518 h and mean annual precipitation of 430 mm over the last 40 years the total precipitation levels in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons were 567 6 mm and 618 9 mm respectively and the daily average air temperatures were 18 1 c and 16 9 c the soil at the study site was classified as calcic cambisol according to fao 2002 at the experimental site the soil in the 0 40 cm layer had a bulk density of 1 36 g cm 3 organic carbon content of 7 35 g kg 1 total nitrogen n content of 0 84 g kg 1 available phosphorus content of 12 32 mg kg 1 and available potassium content of 107 2 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment was conducted in the same field during 2018 and 2019 under rfrh the ridges were 60 cm wide and 15 cm high with plastic film mulch and the bare furrows were 60 cm wide maize was sown at the junction of the ridge and furrow under rfrh three root zones were tested comprising 1 rf r under the ridge 2 rf b under the border of the ridge and furrow 3 rf f in the furrow fig 1 three plots were prepared for the three replicates and each of them was 10 m long and 6 m wide in order to reduce the impacts of different plots each plot was separated by a 60 cm wide border ten days before sowing alternate ridges and furrows were established and fertilizer was broadcast over the soil in the furrow before turning over the soil with a plow finally transparent polyethylene plastic film was applied to cover the ridges fertilizer was applied at a rate of 230 kg ha 1 n and 115 kg ha 1 p2o5 using urea n 46 and di ammonium phosphate n 18 p2o5 46 0 respectively the plastic film mulch was transparent polyethylene with a thickness of 0 008 mm spring maize dafeng 30 was sown using a manually powered hole drilling machine in 5 cm deep holes at a planting density of 82 500 plants ha 1 on april 28 in 2018 and april 29 in 2019 no irrigation was applied during both experimental years and manual weeding was performed to eradicate weeds according to local management practices maize was harvested manually on october 1 2018 and october 2 2019 after harvesting the plastic film was retained to retain moisture in the soil until the next sowing season 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water at the jointing tasseling and filling stages a hand held soil ferric auger diameter 54 mm was used to collect soil samples at the three root zones rf r rf b rf f of each maize plant three representative plants were selected soil samples were collected to a soil depth of 100 cm from the horizontal level of the furrow 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm layer after mixing well put about 15 20 g soil on a plastic bag then removed roots to avoid evaporation this process was carried out in an ice box placed the rootless soil into a 100 ml plastic bottle sealed with parafilm to prevent evaporation and immediately stored in another ice box to determine the soil water isotopes picked roots and remaining soil placed into plastic bags labeled according to the different sites and soil layers and take part of the soil without roots into an aluminum box to measure the swc 2 3 2 stem water maize stems were sampled from the same selected plant at the same time as the soil water samples were collected to avoid isotope fractionation due to plant transpiration we selected maize stems containing no chlorophyll located 5 cm above the soil surface and far from the leaves the stem samples were placed in a 12 ml glass bottle sealed with parafilm to prevent evaporation and stored in a refrigerator immediately the soil water penetration could not be strong during sampling so the samples were collected when there had been no precipitation for at least 3 days the stems and soil samples were collected at about 8 00 a m when the soil water profile dynamics were quite stable because the evapotranspiration was low the soil water and maize stem water were extracted using a vacuum extraction system li 2000 lica china according to the cryogenic vacuum distillation method ehleringer and osmond 1989 all of the water samples were then immediately transferred into airtight bottles and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to avoid evaporation and isotope fractionation before the isotopic analysis was conducted the δ18o levels were measured using an isoprime 100 mass spectrometer results were expressed as parts per thousand deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow precision of 0 1 2 s d was obtained for δ18o in the standard water sample the isotope compositions δ18o were calculated as follows δ r m r s 1000 where rm and rs are the 18o 16o molar ratios for the water sample and standard water v smow respectively and the analytical precision was 0 1 2 3 3 maize roots the spring maize root system was sampled at the same site as the swc and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were determined in the jointing and tasseling stages three representative plants were selected and the root system was excavated as shown in fig 1 the total length of each excavated soil block was 60 cm and the three sections were divided according to the three root zones comprising rf r rf f and rf b where the length of each part was 20 cm and the width of the soil block was 20 cm the depth of the soil block was 60 cm in the jointing stage and 80 cm in the tasseling stage and the soil block was divided into three or four layers each with a thickness of 20 cm thus each root sampling unit was a cube where the length width and height were all 20 cm each soil core section was placed into a nylon netting bag after excavation then put the corresponding removed roots which were selected when the swc and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were sampled into it the soil core section in a nylon netting bag was soaked overnight in a plastic container filled with water the next day each soil sample was poured into 0 25 mm2 mesh sieve and the roots were gently washed with tap water using a hose and nozzle until they were free of soil the mixture of living roots white color organic debris and dead roots dark color on the sieve was separated carefully gregory 1994 jia et al 2018 living roots were then arranged and floated on shallow water in a glass tray 24 cm 32 cm before obtaining an image file using a scanner epson v700 indonesia root images were analyzed to determine the root length and root surface area using winrhizo version 5 0 regent instruments inc quebec city canada the root dry weight was determined after drying at 105 c for 30 min and then drying to constant weight at 75 c 2 4 data calculation 2 4 1 swc swc

uptake the root water uptake by maize from different root zones and its contribution to stem water was assessed using the isosource model based on the multi source mass balance model phillips et al 2005 the basic equations for the model are δ o s i 1 n f i δ o i i 1 n f i 1 where δo is the 18 oxygen isotope composition the subscripts s and i refer to the plant and water source respectively n is the total number of water sources and f is the proportion of one source relative to the total water used by the plant in this model the increment was set to 2 the tolerance of the sum was set to 0 01 and the uncertainty level was set to 0 2 2 5 statistical analysis the data for each sampling event were analyzed separately by analysis of variance using spss 23 0 ibm inc armonk ny usa the mean results for each treatment were compared using the least significant difference test at a probability level of 0 05 all figures were prepared using sigmaplot 12 5 3 results 3 1 soil water distribution the soil water in the planting rows was distributed variously on both sides of the maize plants under rfrh in all growth stages during both years the swc values varied in rf r rf b and rf f near the maize under rfrh in the 0 60 cm soil layer whereas there were no significant differences in the 60 100 cm layer fig 2 in the jointing tasseling and filling stages the swc values in rf f in the 0 60 cm soil profiles were 20 65 6 42 and 9 94 higher than those in rf r and 1 90 4 16 and 4 44 higher than those in rf b during 2018 as well as 16 78 6 90 and 8 59 higher than those in rf r and 3 27 3 20 and 7 95 higher than those in rf b during 2019 swc was significantly higher in rf b than rf r only in the jointing stage i e 18 48 and 13 06 higher during 2018 and 2019 respectively thus rfrh changed the symmetrical distribution of the soil water on both sides of the maize plants 3 2 maize root morphology and distribution rld decreased gradually with the depth of the soil layer and the root system was mostly distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer followed by 20 40 cm and the 40 60 cm layer contained only a small amount of the root system distribution figs 3 4 and 5 rld increased throughout the growth process during both study years and it varied in different zones fig 3 in each soil layer rld was significantly greater in rf b under the plant than rf r and rf f in the jointing stage the rld values in rf f in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers during 2018 were 77 5 and 46 9 higher than those in rf r respectively and 58 0 and 43 7 higher during 2019 in the tasseling stage the rld values in rf f in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers were 64 7 and 18 5 higher respectively than those in rf r during 2018 and 45 2 and 44 2 higher during 2019 in the jointing stage the rld values in rf r in the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers accounted for 76 1 20 5 and 3 4 respectively of the total rld in rf r during 2018 and 75 4 18 7 and 5 9 during 2019 and those in rf f accounted for 80 4 17 9 and 1 6 during 2018 and 78 7 17 7 and 3 6 during 2019 in the tasseling stage the rld values in rf r in the 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm soil layers accounted for 63 4 25 9 8 8 and 1 9 respectively of the total rld in rf r during 2018 and 66 0 21 7 9 1 and 3 2 during 2019 and those in rf f accounted for 71 6 21 0 6 0 and 1 3 of the total rld during 2018 and 69 6 22 7 5 4 and 2 3 during 2019 the pattern was similar in 2019 compared with rf f the proportion of the rld was higher in rf r than rf f except in the 0 20 cm soil layer the root surface area and root dry weight for the soil profiles in rf r and rf f exhibited similar trends to the rld figs 4 and 5 3 3 maize root water uptake the δ18o values determined for the soil water exhibited a clear gradient distribution in the vertical profile and they were enriched in the surface soil layer fig 6 in the growth stage during both years the δ18o levels fluctuated in the soil profiles where the fluctuations were greatest in the subsoil but they decreased with the soil deepening in each growth stage during both years the δ18o values in the soil profiles in rf r rf f and rf b differed significantly in the surface layer and the difference decreased gradually with the soil layer deepened the direct inference approach is based on the theory that no fractionation of stable oxygen isotopes occurs during the uptake of water by the roots dawson and ehleringer 1991 thus the intersection of δ18o in the stem water with that in the soil water for a certain profile indicates that the maize absorb water mainly from this layer in the jointing stage during 2018 and 2019 the δ18o value in the stem water intersected with that in the soil water in the 0 20 cm layer in rf r rf f and rf b in the tasseling stage during both years the intersections occurred in the 20 40 cm layer in the filling stage during both years two intersections occurred in the 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm layers in rf r and rf b and in the 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers in rf f thus the main depths for root water uptake were 0 20 cm in the jointing stage 20 40 cm in the tasseling stage and 40 80 cm in rf r and rf b and 20 60 cm in rf f in the filling stage therefore roots uptake water from deeper soil layers as the growth stage advanced the multiple source mass balance method can assess all possible combinations of each water source to estimate the range of possible water contributions from a certain depth to the root water uptake based on a frequency histogram in the growth stage during both years the histogram patterns were relatively convergent at some depths whereas others were broad and diffuse fig 7 in the jointing stage during 2018 the frequency histograms for rf r rf b and rf f converged in the 0 20 cm layer whereas they were broad and diffuse at other depths the results indicated that the water uptake in the three root zones were mainly from the soil water in the 0 20 cm layer which accounted for 58 78 mean value was 71 9 of the total water uptake from rf r 78 90 mean value was 85 2 of the total water uptake from rf b and 74 86 mean value was 81 8 of the total water uptake from rf f the root water uptake depths were deeper as the growth stage advanced in the tasseling stage during 2018 the maize mainly absorbed water from the 0 20 cm soil layer followed by the 20 40 cm soil layer which accounted for 0 68 mean value was 39 2 and 0 88 mean value was 31 6 respectively of the total water uptake from rf r 4 76 mean value was 52 6 and 0 96 mean value was 25 8 of the total water uptake from rf b and 0 64 mean value was 42 3 and 0 96 mean value was 27 9 of total water uptake from rf f in the tasseling stage the contribution of the 0 20 cm soil layer to the total water uptake from rf r was lower than that from rf b and rf f whereas that in the 20 40 cm layer was higher in the filling stage during 2018 and 2019 the maize roots mainly absorbed soil water from the 40 60 cm layer in rf r and rf b which accounted for 46 90 mean value was 64 1 and 54 88 mean value was 65 8 in 2018 respectively and 64 90 mean value was 74 5 and 50 86 mean value was 65 5 during 2019 in rf f the contributions from the 40 60 cm layer were 0 88 mean value was 49 9 and 0 100 mean value was 27 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and those from the 20 40 cm layer were 0 98 mean value was 30 0 and 0 88 mean value was 53 9 during 2018 and 2019 the soil depth of root water uptake was deepened as the growth stage advanced in the different root zones the contributions of the shallower soil layers 0 20 cm layer in the jointing and tasseling stages and 20 40 cm layer in the filling stage in rf r were lower than those in rf b and rf f whereas those of the deeper layers 20 40 cm layer in the jointing and tasseling stages and 40 60 cm layer in the filling stage were higher in rf r the maize roots absorbed more water from the shallow soil in rf f the water uptake patterns in 2019 were similar to those in 2018 3 4 maize root distribution and water uptake pearson correlation analysis showed significant positive correlation between the proportion of soil water uptake and the proportion of root distribution fig 8 the proportion of soil water uptake was significantly correlated with the proportion of root length in rf r rf b and rf f at p 0 01 r 0 8717 0 9101 and 0 9187 respectively the proportion of soil water uptake showed a significant correlation with the proportion of root surface area in rf r rf b and rf f at p 0 01 r 0 8194 0 8856 and 0 9250 respectively similarly the proportion of soil water uptake also significantly correlated with the proportion of root dry weight in rf r rf b and rf f at p 0 01 r 0 8958 0 8847 and 0 9327 respectively generally the proportion of water uptake increased with the proportion of root length root surface area and root dry weight 4 discussion 4 1 soil water distribution and maize root distribution the dynamic changes in the soil water are affected by rainfall plant transpiration soil surface evaporation deep soil water leakage and lateral migration wang et al 2012 wu et al 2017 in the present study we found that swc differed on the two sides of the maize plant under rfrh where it was significantly higher in rf f than rf r by contrast the swc in the planting rows was distributed symmetrically on both sides of the maize under fp the differences in the swc were due to changes in the soil profile structure in the ridges and furrows thus infiltration and evaporation affected the entire soil surface under fp whereas they only occurred in the furrows under rfrh jiang and li 2015 used dye tracer and simulated rainfall to assess the effects of fully mulching the ridge furrow with plastic film on the rainwater distribution in the soil where the results showed that rainwater was mainly absorbed by the soil matrix of over the whole surface under traditional flat planting whereas it moved to the deeper soil profile below the furrows in the rfrh system thus the rainwater was distributed evenly and shallowly under traditional flat planting whereas it was concentrated in the furrows and distributed to a greater depth under the rfrh system in the maize growth period during both years the swc in the shallow soil layer 0 60 cm was significantly higher in rf f than rf r whereas there were no significant differences in the deep soil layers this difference was mainly due to the function and mechanism of the rfrh system where the plastic film mulched ridge concentrated the rainfall into the furrow i e the runoff from the ridge and the rainfall falling in the furrow combined in the furrow to enhance the infiltration and effectively increase the swc ghosh et al 2006 wang et al 2008 our two year study showed that the maize roots were mainly distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer followed by the 20 40 cm layer whereas few roots were distributed in the 40 60 cm layer wu et al 2016 reported that 50 80 of the maize roots were present in the 0 20 cm soil layer under field conditions a previous study of root growth and lodging resistance in maize under the rfrh system obtained similar results where the rld and root surface area density in the 0 20 cm soil layer accounted for more than 50 of the roots in all soil layers ranging from 0 to 100 cm jia et al 2018 the results were consistent in both years where the majority of the maize roots were distributed in the 0 30 cm soil layer and the root weight density decreased significantly as the soil depth increased gao et al 2014 in the present study in 2018 and 2019 the rld root surface area and root dry weight were significantly higher in the 0 40 cm soil layer in rf f than rf r whereas those in the 40 80 cm soil layer were lower in rf f than rf r figs 3 4 and 5 probably because this planting pattern changed the water distribution in the soil profile the rfrh system with film mulching can effectively channel rainwater into the crop rooting zones thereby affecting the absorption of precipitation by the roots gan et al 2013 therefore the higher swc in the 0 40 soil layer in rf f fig 2 stimulated the growth of the root system in the 0 40 cm layer whereas the lower swc in the 0 40 cm soil layer in rf r stimulated the growth of the root system deeper into the soil to absorb water in general a high swc in the planting zone will lead to the horizontally extension of the roots whereas a low swc will lead to their longitudinal extension previous studies have demonstrated that the crop root characteristics are closely related to the swc in the present study the soil water distribution was similar to the root distribution a previous study of canola in semiarid australia by kirkegaard et al 1997 also demonstrated that the rld and rooting depth were strongly related to the soil water availability similarly studies of legumes in canada showed that the rld root weight density root volume density and root diameter were positively related to the water availability liu et al 2012 a study by jiang and li 2015 indicated that the high swc region mostly matched with the main maize root zone in the rfrh system these highly consistent results may be explained by water increasing the availability of nutrients to improve the growth of the roots kumar and lal 2012 4 2 maize root water uptake and root distribution in the growth period during both years we found that the surface soil water was isotopically enriched where δ18o changed greatly in the shallow soil layers but little in the deep soil layers fig 6 this phenomenon is caused by strong evaporation in semi arid areas which has less effect on the water isotope composition in the deeper soil xu et al 2012 in the present study δ18o differed significantly in the shallow soil layers between rf r rf b and rf f these differences may have been due to the variations in evaporation with and without the film english et al 2007 or 18o redistribution due to isotope fractionation during the water infiltration process when rainwater collected in the furrows araguás araguás et al 1995 gazis and feng 2004 in the present study similar results were obtained using the direct inference approach and the frequency histogram based on the water absorption depth the lack of difference might have been due to the limitation of the direct inference approach because it can only estimate the main water uptake depth for maize and it ignores the water that can be provided by water from various soil layers at a fixed proportion the root water uptake was deeper as the growth stage advanced figs 6 and 7 this trend was similar for the root morphological characteristics and distribution figs 3 4 and 5 thereby indicating that the change in the water uptake depth could be explained by root development during the growth period zhao et al 2018 the root distribution is an important indicator of the potential water uptake coelho and or 1999 taylor and klepper 1974 also reported that the spatial distribution of the roots has an important effect on root water uptake thus the main water absorption depth for the root system gradually increased as the main root system distribution extended deeper during the entire growth stage li et al 2011 however a study in the midwestern usa showed that maize mainly obtained water from the 0 20 cm soil layer and that there was no flexibility in the water use by the roots asbjornsen et al 2007b these different water uptake modes may be explained by genetic differences in cultivars and environmental factors romero saltos et al 2005 west et al 2012 voltas et al 2015 the frequency histogram can also determine the ranges of possible contributions from different soil layers to root water uptake in the root zones in rf r rf b and rf f the contribution of the same soil layers to root water uptake differed during the maize growth stages fig 7 which could be explained by the root distribution the contribution of each soil layer to root water uptake increased with the proportion of the root system in the soil layer relative to the total root system in the root zone in the jointing and tasseling stages the 0 20 cm soil layer made the highest contribution to the root water uptake in rf b followed by rf f because the highest proportion of the root system was in the 0 20 cm soil layer according to the following trend rf b rf f rf r figs 3 4 and 5 the root system in the 20 40 cm soil layer enlarged gradually as the growth stage advanced and it played an important role in the uptake of soil water in the tasseling stage the contribution of this soil layer to the root water uptake was higher under the ridge than the furrow where the proportion of the root system in the 20 40 cm soil layer followed the trend rf b rf r rf f figs 3 4 and 5 there were significant positive correlation between the contribution of soil water to maize root and the proportion of root length density root surface area and root dry weight fig 8 a study by ma and song 2016 also indicated that the contribution of each soil layer to the uptake of water by maize was positively correlated with the proportional root distribution however some studies have indicated that the root distribution characteristics do not always match those of the water uptake thorburn and ehleringer 1995 dawson and pate 1996 due to differences among plant species and the effects of environmental factors stahl et al 2013 5 conclusion the rfrh system produced higher swc in the furrow than the ridge especially in the shallow soil profile 0 60 cm and more roots were distributed in the 0 40 cm soil layer under the furrow than the ridge the uptake of water extended to greater depths as the roots developed longitudinally throughout the growth stages there were significant positive correlation between the contribution of soil water to maize root and the proportion of root distribution the contributions of shallower soil layers 0 20 cm layer in the jointing and tasseling stages and 20 40 cm layer in the filling stage to the total water uptake from rf r were lower than those from rf b and rf f whereas the contributions of the deeper soil layers 20 40 cm layer in the jointing and tasseling stages and 40 60 cm layer in the filling stage were higher therefore under rfrh the maize roots absorbed water from deeper in the soil as the growth stages advanced and more water was absorbed from the shallower soil layers and less from the deeper soil layers in rf f than rf r understanding the water uptake mechanism is important for improving the crop
