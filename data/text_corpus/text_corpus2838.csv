14190,acid mine drainage amd is an important source of pollution to the environment characterized by a very low ph and high metal loid s concentration the objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of three alkaline materials marl sandstone and calcareous crust on amd neutralization and metal precipitation to achieve this objective a batch test was design where a 5 10 alkaline material g amd ml ratio was used in order to optimize the process three particle sizes 2 10 10 20 and 20 30 mm of each material were used and water samples were collected during the neutralization time due to the extreme ph of amd used ph 2 5 it was necessary to carry out an amd pretreatment which consisted of adding 2 5 g of ca oh 2 per liter of amd to raise a ph of 4 this pretreatment was essential because when amd ph 4 was in contact with alkaline material a fast disintegration had place and a viscous substance was forming which prevented water rehabilitation the results showed that the three alkaline materials reduced fe as cd cu pb and zn concentrations in amd due mainly to their high carbonates content which allowed metal loid s precipitation the removal percentages were 100 for fe cu and pb for marl sandstone and calcareous crust and about 60 for zn and cd when sandstone was used the optimal size particle was 20 30 mm for marl while for sandstone with a size particle of 10 20 mm a considerable reduction of metal loid s in amd was observed besides the contact time required to neutralization of amd and metal loid s reduction was lower for marl and sandstone than calcareous crust therefore the results of this study showed that anyone of these alkaline materials could be used in amd treatment depending on availability in the study area keywords acid mine

impacts of amd 11 if left untreated amd can contaminate ground and surface water and thereby damage ecosystems and potentially impact human health 12 thus in order to preserve and protect the environment and enhance ecological sustainability proper prevention of amd generation should be one of the important preconditions 9 the degree of environmental pollution by amd is dependent on its composition and ph which in turn may vary depending on both the geology of the mine sites and mining processes used 9 neutralization of acid water occurs in natural systems in association with some geological strata which allow precipitate metals either as carbonates or as hydroxides however excess quantities of acid that are beyond the natural neutralizing systems are often produced therefore the release of this toxic water onto land and natural water streams is unavoidable thus causing dire environmental consequences 13 if amd is not managed properly it causes considerable environmental degradation water and soil contamination severe health impact on nearby communities biodiversity loss and aquatic ecosystem whose negative environmental impacts pass from generation to generation 9 acid mine drainage can be treated with different technologies the methods used to treat amd can be classified as active or passive systems based on their requirements for chemical addition infrastructure maintenance and monitoring 14 the active treatment methods include continuous addition of chemicals and substrates to precipitate metals membrane processes ion exchange etc that have been applied to reduce its negative impact on the receiving environment 13 15 18 however chemical treatment of amd which is composed of several dissolved toxic metals is too complex expensive and difficult to management therefore one of the current research line is to use inexpensive materials for amd reclamation the passive treatments use systems which favors pseudo natural processes 19 as such as chemical biological and physical removal processes that occur naturally in the environment 20 and involves systems as constructed wetlands or bioreactors 9 in fact a variety of techniques have been tested and or employed to control amd at its source including the use of limestone and alkaline industrial waste products such as fly as cement kiln dust green liquor dregs and bauxite residues 21 the importance of calcareous materials in supplying carbonates to neutralize acidity and contributing to buffer capacity of geological media is well recognized 22 marls are composed mainly of clay minerals and carbonates in different concentration usually between 20 and 65 23 24 and they together with limestones are the most abundant rocks in the study area murcia region sandstones are generally formed by various types of carbonate cements 25 specifically in murcia region they have a carbonated composition because of their grains and cements are usually calcium carbonate by the erosion of limestone rocks other common alkaline materials in murcia region and in other areas with arid and semiarid climate are the calcareous crusts that are formed as consequence of carbonate calcium precipitation which usually are found in the foothills of the mountains and plainlands in this area therefore the main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of alkaline materials for amd neutralization and metals precipitation considering the following parameters to be optimized a type of alkaline material to be used b optimum particle size and c neutralization velocity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling collection the study area is located in murcia region se spain this region has a semiarid mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 18 c and an average annual rainfall of 275 mm and evapotranspiration rate exceeds 600 mm year 1 26 27 the amd used in this study came from the sierra minera of cartagena la uni√≥n southeast of spain specifically from brunita quarry where lead and zinc ores were mined and whose mining operations finished in 1990 being operative for more than 2500 years 28 although the mining activity was abandoned thirty years ago millions of tons of waste were accumulated on the surface of the land forming mining ponds and 29 causing changes in the visual characteristics of the area and produced physiographic modifications and alterations in the landscape 7 these mining ponds are composed by high amounts of fe oxyhydroxides sulphates and potentially leachable metal loid s due to extreme acidic conditions and salinity once the mining was ceased the groundwater was contaminated creating a red lake in the former brunita quarry the amd used in this study were sampled from this lake fig 1 and it was collected with a polyethylene container of 20 l which was hermetically sealed and transport to the laboratory where was kept in refrigeration until it was analyzed the period of sampling was on february 2018 when there is a low evapotranspiration with an average high temperature of 19 3 c and an average low temperature of 9 9 c and an average rainfall of 22 mm during this month which does not affect the characteristics of lake water in order to select the materials to be used for amd reclamation geological and soil maps from areas close to mining area were evaluated the geological study of the area revealed that huge amounts of carbonated sedimentary rocks such as marls and sandstones are available in the sierra del puerto a mountain range located 40 km north of mining area fig 1 in addition many of the soil from campo de cartagena which is the most important agricultural area close to mining activity are composed by pretrocalcic horizons which has been broken and placed in soil surface by farmers to allow proper rooting of crops this material is called calcareous crust and it is consider a waste without any use fig 1 therefore the alkaline materials used as acid neutralizing agents were marl sandstone and calcareous crust for its high content of carbonates they are used as acid neutralizing agent which can be used as a complexing binding or ions exchange agent for metal ions in liquid solution it meaning metal loid s can precipitate 30 about 10 kg of each of these materials were sampled each material was mixed and homogenized and they were sieved in three size particles 30 20 mm 20 10 mm and 10 2 mm which were used in the amd treatment 2 2 experiment design for acid mine drainage neutralization and metals arsenic immobilization the test to amd reclamation consisted on put in contact acid water with different alkaline materials firstly a previous test was performed to evaluate the behavior of alkaline material when they were contact with amd of ph 2 5 the result was a high and fast degradation of the material and the formation of a sludge which prevented water sampling and analysis this was caused by a fast degradation of carbonates of the alkaline materials and the formations of slurry with the rest of minerals in addition the high concentration of iron in the amd precipitated on the surface of this slurry prevent the water flow in order to prevent this high and fast degradation of alkaline materials and formation of sludge a pretreatment was carried out amd ph was increased up to 4 with calcium hydroxide ca oh 2 besides in order to know the optimum amount of calcium hydroxide to be used the pretreatment was carried out with a concentration from 0 5 g ca oh 2 l 1 to 5 g l 1 data no showed being 2 5 g ca oh 2 l 1 the selected concentration because it showed a ph close to 4 in amd once the pretreatment was optimized the main experimental setup was performed contacting the amd at ph 4 with the three different alkaline materials and with three particles size 30 20 mm 20 10 mm and 10 2 mm fig 2 five hundred grams of each alkaline material were added into 1000 ml of amd ph and electrical conductivity e c were continually measured and 10 ml were extracted in different time 0 15 30 60 225 345 s for marl 0 15 30 48 240 s for sandstone 0 60 120 255 555 1155s for calcareous crust different sampling time was used because of the time of ph neutralization were different for each material in each amd sample metal loid s concentration was analyzed 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analytical methods for acid mine drainage acid mine drainage samples were filtered with a 0 45 Œºm paper filter before analysis ph was determined using glp21 crison and e c using glp31 crison a mass spectrometer icp ms model agilent 7500a was used to determine the total metal loid s concentrations fe as cd cu pb and zn 31 these metal loid s were selected because they were main metals extracted by the mining activity pyrite arsenopyrite galena and sphalerite and the main responsible of surface and groundwater pollution 32 33 2 3 2 analytical methods for characterization of alkaline materials alkaline materials samples were dried for 48 h at 45 c a split of each sample was ground using an agate mortar retschrm 100 the ph was measured in 1 1 water alkaline material suspension 34 while the e c was measured in a 1 5 alkaline material water suspension 35 the equivalent calcium carbonate was determined using the bernard s calcimeter and the total metal loid s concentrations in alkaline materials were digested using hno3 and h3clo4 36 and determinate by icp ms model agilent 7500a instrument optimization evaluation and quality control included the use of reference soil material from the federal institute for material research bam u110 obtaining recoveries of 93 101 for cd 95 98 for pb 97 104 for as 96 105 for fe 98 106 for zn and 99 102 for cu blanks and reference standards during the analyses and sample replicates the mineral composition of alkaline materials was determined by x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction analysis was conducted on randomly oriented ground samples using a d8 x ray diffractometer bruker germany with cu ka radiation operated at 40 kv and 30 ma the morphology and the in situ chemical composition of samples were observed and determined using a xls 30 sem philips the netherlands equipped with energy dispersive system eds the sample for sem analysis was mounted on an aluminum stub and coated with platinum for 3 min using a denton vacuum system prior to submicroscopic observations the sem was operated at 15 kev and 1 94 a filament current in situ chemical composition of particles was recorded in edax spectrum collected either in spot 1 mm or full field of view mode for 400 s semi quantitative 5 elemental composition of particles was corrected for z atomic number a absorption and f fluorescence factors 2 4 statistical analysis microsoft excel was used to perform a descriptive statistical analysis of the data for the purpose of showing the metal loid s concentration when increased ph scatter plots were represented from a polynomial equation bar graphs were used to showed metals arsenic concentration in amd when it was treated with the three alkaline materials and with three different size particle from a polynomial equation speed of metal loid s reduction when amd was treated with marl sandstone and calcareous crust was represented with scatter plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of acid mine drainage and alkaline materials ph e c and concentration of metal loid s in amd and alkaline materials are showed in table 1 the acid mine drainage use in this study was catalogued as highly acid 37 and salty 38 the results indicated that the concentrations of fe cu zn as cd and pb were high and similar to those reported in other studies 6 14 in contrast alkaline materials were characterized by a basic ph and no salinity 39 concentrations of fe cu zn as cd and pb were low and similar to those found in sedimentary soils and rocks of murcia region 27 the content of carbonates was very high for marl sandstone and calcareous crust with values of 48 65 92 respectively which suggests a high potential to be used as neutralization agent to increase ph in acidic water and therefore suitable to be used as a material to treat amd 22 minerals identified in sandstone and marl were calcite caco3 dolomite mgca co3 2 and quartz sio2 sem edax analysis showed that the matrix of sandstone was mainly composed by sand size grains of quartz 50 2000 mm cemented by calcite and dolomite minerals fig 3 a while the matrix of marl was characterized by clay size grain of quartz 2 mm cemented by carbonate minerals fig 3b in contrast calcareous crust was mainly composed by a matrix of consolidated calcite covered by small particles of quartz 10 mm fig 3c 3 2 effect of alkaline materials on amd reclamation the behavior of metals and arsenic when ph in amd was increased using different alkaline materials with a particle size of 10 20 mm is showed in fig 4 both zn and cd concentrations had a progressive decrease for the three alkaline materials as ph was elevated the results pointed out that zn and cd significantly decreased at 6 5 as a result of the high neutralizing ability of these alkaline materials this high removal efficiency is due to below ph 7 in amd zn and cd exists as zn2 and cd2 14 forming an insoluble precipitate 40 probably znco3 and cdco3 41 43 other studies had reported that zn tends to precipitate as hydroxide zn oh 2 at a minimum ph of 8 4 when concrete is used 44 in addition other authors showed that in a ph range of 7 8 2 ionic zinc gets converted to a hydroycarbonate precipitate hydrozoncite zn5 co3 2 oh 6 14 on the other hand the lowest concentration of zn in treated water was found for marl while the highest was reported when calcareous crust was used despite of its higher carbonate concentration and permeability 23 however this could occur because carbonates in marl were less cemented than in calcareous crust and therefore the surface to precipitate metal loid s was bigger oppositely the reduction of fe cu and pb concentrations in amd was higher at ph 5 5 finding the lowest concentrations of these three metals in amd at ph 6 5 when marl was applied the removal of these metals from amd was relatively rapid with a sharp decline observed for all alkalis investigated the remarkable removal efficiency of fe cu and pb was attributed to the availability of exchange sites for these elements 38 and the co precipitation of cu and pb with fe 44 evidently as suggested these materials were effective in fully removing metals from acidic mine drainage whose main mechanisms implied were the co precipitation with carbonates when ph was increased 9 the behavior of as was totally different to the previous metals increasing its concentration with the ph for calcareous crust while a slight decrease was observed when marl was used in addition sandstone had not significant variations in as concentrations when ph was increased other studies carried out with limestone showed as concentration significantly dropped 45 this proves that the behavior of as in amd is different depending on the material used for neutralization besides in as rich amd waters as is usually immobilized by co precipitation with iron hydroxysulfates however this mechanism involves microbial mediated reactions that lead to incomplete removal of as 46 3 3 influence of particle size of alkaline materials on treatment of amd the particle size is one of the main factors affecting the efficiency of metal loid s removal processes the effect of particle size of alkaline materials on the treatment efficiency of metal loid s when ph of the amd was 6 5 is shown in fig 5 the concentrations of all metal loid s were reduced for all particle size when marl was used fe cu and pb were totally eliminated from amd however zn as and cd were reduced but they were not totally eliminated obtaining the lower concentrations in amd when the particle size of the marl was the highest 20 30 mm this result can be due to because highest particles of marls are composed by higher concentration of carbonates and lower of clay than smaller one which promotes the co precipitation of zn as and cd with carbonates oppositely other studies have shown that smaller particles have larger specific surface area allowing more contact with alkaline materials and therefore amd neutralization 8 besides all contaminants removal efficiency decreased when increase in particle size because smaller particles increase dissolution of caco3 in materials 30 for sandstone particles size of 20 30 mm concentrations of fe cu and pb were not totally eliminated although they were considerably reduced the other two particles size achieved concentrations close to cero for fe cu and pb in the amd mainly when 10 20 mm was the particle size used the rest of metal loid s were decreased for all particle size with small variations among them the heterogeneous behavior of metals removal when the particles sizes are used is due to sandstone with coarse medium and fine grains have different microstructures and cementation degrees sandstones with medium and fine grains bear rich clay minerals while sandstones with coarse grains contain very few clay minerals 47 besides other research showed that sandstones are heavily compacted being carbonates and clay minerals the predominant pore filling diagenetic cements 25 45 in addition the intergranular pores intragranular pores microfractures and micropores of sandstones 25 could explain the different behavior of each size particle finally the three particle sizes had a different effect on metals precipitation when calcareous crust was used fig 5 concentrations of cu zn cd and as were higher for 10 20 mm particle size than for the other two particle sizes however metals in amd were not completely eliminated in any case in contrast concentrations of fe and pb were almost eliminated from amd especially pb the main reason for this behavior is likely due to that calcareous crust grains are rapidly coated with a thin layer of iron prevented a efficient precipitation of the rest of metals 45 3 4 effectiveness of acid neutralization and metals arsenic immobilization taking into account the concentrations of the studied metal loid s before and after amd treatment by alkaline materials marl sandstone and calcareous crust and for a size particle of 10 20 mm metals mainly removed were pb fe and cu with a removal percentage close to 100 table 2 other research evaluated the effectiveness of alkalis such as lime sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate concluded that 99 7 of fe was removed 14 others found that 63 6 of fe was removal when stainless steel slag was applied compared to 99 7 fe removal when basic oxygen furnace slag was used 11 in addition it was evaluated the potential use of pervious concrete for treating amd and reported a removal efficiency of 98 for fe in an amd collected from a gold mine and 87 for a amd from a coalfield 44 similarly significant reductions were obtained with cement kiln dust lime kiln dust red mud bauxite coal fly ash and blast furnace slag which removed over 99 of cd cu fe and zn 9 considering the results of the total efficiencies in the treatment of amd with powdered limestone and limewater ca oh 2 45 the lower as efficiencies of removal were identified in accordance with our results table 2 another study showed that recycled concrete aggregates treatment decreased cu concentrations in amd by 33 80 and zn concentrations by over 95 while fly ash treatment reduced cu concentrations by 99 10 for marl and sandstone used in this study zn and cd were removal about 60 in amd while calcareous crust had a removal efficiency of 40 to zn although the efficiencies were high for all alkaline materials marl showed the best results likely because of its less cementation however zn as and cd were not completely eliminated therefore an additional treatment using chemicals should be evaluate to increase the removal effectivity 9 however at industrial scale the use of these materials as passive treatment could be enough to minimize the environmental impacts of amd this passive treatment would consist in the construction of alkaline channels using calcareous crust sandstone and marl where the amd would circulate by gravity only it would be recommendable increase the contact time between these materials and the amd to ensure acid neutralization and metals precipitation in addition a monitoring plan should be designed to assess the state of the alkaline material to replace it when excessive degradation is observed or when the efficiency of metal removal is below expected 3 5 influence of contact time between alkaline materials amd evolution of metals and arsenic concentrations vs contact time for the three alkaline materials used for amd reclamation is showed in fig 6 six minutes contact time was necessary to most of metal loid s concentration decreased in amd when marl was used although in the first minute the highest reductions were observed copper decreased considerably in the first minute as well as fe cadmium was progressively reduced and as and pb were eliminated in amd after 6 min contact time sandstone had a similar behavior than marl to minimize metal loid s from amd however the necessary time to get similar reductions was 4 min when amd was treated with calcareous crust fe and pb were eliminated at 19 min copper quickly decreased in the first two minutes while cd and zn showed a progressive decrease the longer time of neutralization compared with the previous materials is due to calcareous crust is more difficult to disintegrate since it is more compact and harder than marls and sandstone and therefore react more slowly than the previous alkali materials in spite of its high carbonates concentration other studies performed with carbide lime which contains 94 3 of cao and with a metals concentration about 0 5 2 5 g l 1 needed between 5 70 min of reaction time to decrease metals 40 similarly the use of eggshells required 40 min to achieve complete removal of fe 30 4 conclusions results showed that all alkaline materials tested marl sandstone and calcareous crust can be used for amd rehabilitation due to its high capability to increase ph and decrease metal loid s concentration by precipitation however fe cu zn as cd and pb concentrations in amd treated with marl were lower than those reported when sandstone and calcareous crust were used in addition the behavior of metals was different zn and cd decreased progressively from ph 4 to ph 6 5 while fe cu and pb did it suddenly when ph was 5 5 oppositely arsenic behavior was different to the previous metals which depended on alkaline material used to treat amd the optimal particle size for metals removing from amd when marl was used was 20 30 mm however fe cu and pb were removed from amd for all particle sizes while zn as and cd had lower concentrations for this size which suggested that the higher amount of carbonate in the largest particles of marl promoted a higher co pecipitation of metals sandstone allowed a high reduction of metal loid s in amd for all particle size being fe cu and pb specially decreased for 10 20 mm however zn cd and as had similar reductions in amd for the three particle size finally although fe and pb were similarly removed for all particle size when amd was treated with calcareous crust the behavior of the rest of metal loid s was variable which was likely due to calcareous crust grains are rapidly coated with a thin layer of iron prevented an efficient precipitation of the rest of metals the removal efficiency of the three alkaline materials with a size particle of 10 20 mm was close to 100 for pb fe and cu however sandstone reduced zn and cd about 60 in amd and calcareous crust had a removal efficiency of 40 for zn in order to increase the removal efficacy of these metals additional treatment using chemicals should be evaluate however at large scale it would be recommendable increase the contact time between these materials and the amd to ensure acid neutralization and metals precipitation marl and sandstone showed the shortest contact time with amd for full neutralization allowing a fast precipitation of metal loid s oppositely although calcareous crust has a carbonates concentration of 98 needed longer contact time to achieve the neutralization and metals precipitation which was due to a more compact structure and harder consistence than marls and sandstone declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

essential because when amd ph 4 was in contact with alkaline material a fast disintegration had place and a viscous substance was forming which prevented water rehabilitation the results showed that

7500a was used to determine the total metal loid s concentrations fe as cd cu pb and zn 31 these metal loid s were selected because they were main metals extracted by the mining activity pyrite arsenopyrite galena and sphalerite and the main responsible of surface and groundwater pollution 32 33 2 3 2 analytical methods for characterization of alkaline materials alkaline materials samples were dried for 48 h at 45 c a split of each sample was ground using an agate mortar retschrm 100 the ph was measured in 1 1 water alkaline material suspension 34 while the e c was measured in a 1 5 alkaline material water suspension 35 the equivalent calcium carbonate was determined using the bernard s calcimeter and the total metal loid s concentrations in alkaline materials were digested using hno3 and h3clo4 36 and determinate by icp ms model agilent 7500a instrument optimization evaluation and quality control included the use of reference soil material from the federal institute for material research bam u110 obtaining recoveries of 93 101 for cd 95 98 for pb 97 104 for as 96 105 for fe 98 106 for zn and 99 102 for cu blanks and reference standards during the analyses and sample replicates the mineral composition of alkaline materials was determined by x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction analysis was conducted on randomly oriented ground samples using a d8 x ray diffractometer bruker germany with cu ka radiation operated at 40 kv and 30 ma the morphology and the in situ chemical composition of samples were observed and determined using a xls 30 sem philips the netherlands equipped with energy dispersive system eds the sample for sem analysis was mounted on an aluminum stub and coated with platinum for 3 min using a denton vacuum system prior to submicroscopic observations the sem was operated at 15 kev and 1 94 a filament current in situ chemical composition of particles was recorded in edax spectrum collected

statistical analysis microsoft excel was used to perform a descriptive statistical analysis of the data for the purpose of showing the metal loid s concentration when increased ph scatter plots were represented from a polynomial equation bar graphs were used to showed metals arsenic concentration in amd when it was treated with the three alkaline materials and with three different size particle from a polynomial equation speed of metal loid s reduction when amd was treated with marl sandstone and calcareous crust was represented with scatter plots 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of acid mine drainage and alkaline materials ph e c and concentration of metal loid s in amd and alkaline materials are showed in table 1 the acid mine drainage use in this study was catalogued as highly acid 37 and salty 38 the results indicated that the concentrations of fe cu zn as cd and pb were high and similar to those reported in other studies 6 14 in contrast alkaline materials were characterized by a basic ph and no salinity 39 concentrations of fe cu zn as cd and pb were low and similar to those found in sedimentary soils and rocks of murcia region 27 the content of carbonates was very high for marl sandstone and calcareous crust with values of 48 65 92 respectively which suggests a high potential to be used as neutralization agent to increase ph in acidic water and therefore suitable to be used as a material to treat amd 22 minerals identified in sandstone and marl were calcite caco3 dolomite mgca co3 2 and quartz sio2 sem edax analysis showed that the matrix of sandstone was mainly composed by sand size grains of quartz 50 2000 mm cemented by calcite and dolomite minerals fig 3 a while the matrix of marl was characterized by clay size grain of quartz 2 mm cemented by carbonate minerals fig 3b in contrast calcareous crust was mainly composed by a matrix of consolidated calcite covered by small particles of quartz 10 mm fig 3c 3 2 effect of alkaline materials on amd reclamation the behavior of metals and arsenic when ph in amd was increased using different alkaline materials with a particle size of 10 20 mm is showed in fig 4 both zn and cd concentrations had a progressive decrease for the three alkaline materials as ph was elevated the results pointed out that zn and cd significantly decreased at 6 5 as a result of the high neutralizing ability of these alkaline materials this high removal efficiency is due to below ph 7 in amd zn and cd exists as zn2 and cd2 14 forming an insoluble precipitate 40 probably znco3 and cdco3 41 43 other studies had reported that zn tends to precipitate as hydroxide zn oh 2 at a minimum ph of 8 4 when concrete is used 44 in addition other authors showed that in a ph range of 7 8 2 ionic zinc gets converted to a hydroycarbonate precipitate hydrozoncite zn5 co3 2 oh 6 14 on the other hand the lowest concentration of zn in treated water was found for marl while the highest was reported when calcareous crust was used despite of its higher carbonate concentration and permeability 23 however this could occur because carbonates in marl were less cemented than in calcareous crust and therefore the surface to precipitate metal loid s was bigger oppositely the reduction of fe cu and pb concentrations in amd was higher at ph 5 5 finding the lowest concentrations of these three metals in amd at ph 6 5 when marl was applied the removal of these metals from amd was relatively rapid with a sharp decline observed for all alkalis investigated the remarkable removal efficiency of fe cu and pb was attributed to the availability of exchange sites for these elements 38 and the co precipitation of cu and pb with fe 44 evidently as suggested these materials were effective in fully removing metals from acidic mine drainage whose main mechanisms implied were the co precipitation with carbonates when ph was increased 9 the behavior of as was totally different to the previous metals increasing its concentration with the ph for calcareous crust while a slight decrease was observed when marl was used in addition sandstone had not significant variations in as concentrations when ph was increased other studies carried out with limestone showed as concentration significantly dropped 45 this proves that the behavior of as in amd is different depending on the material used for neutralization besides in as rich amd waters as is usually immobilized by co precipitation with iron hydroxysulfates however this mechanism involves microbial mediated reactions that lead to incomplete removal of as 46 3 3 influence of particle size of alkaline materials on treatment of amd the particle size is one of the main factors affecting the efficiency of metal loid s removal processes the effect of particle size of alkaline materials on the treatment efficiency of metal loid s when ph of the amd was 6 5 is shown in fig 5 the concentrations of all metal loid s were reduced for all particle size when marl was used fe cu and pb were totally eliminated from amd however zn as and cd were reduced but they were not totally eliminated obtaining the lower concentrations in amd when the particle size of the marl was the highest 20 30 mm this result can be due to because highest particles of marls are composed by higher concentration of carbonates and lower of clay than smaller one which promotes the co precipitation of zn as and cd with carbonates oppositely other studies have shown that smaller particles have larger specific surface area allowing more contact with alkaline materials and therefore amd neutralization 8 besides all contaminants removal efficiency decreased when increase in particle size because smaller particles increase dissolution of caco3 in materials 30 for sandstone particles size of 20 30 mm concentrations of fe cu and pb were not totally eliminated although they were considerably reduced the other two particles size achieved concentrations close to cero for fe cu and pb in the amd mainly when 10 20 mm was the particle size used the rest of metal loid s were decreased for all particle size with small variations among them the heterogeneous behavior of metals removal when the particles sizes are used is due to sandstone with coarse medium and fine grains have different microstructures and cementation degrees sandstones with medium and fine grains bear rich clay minerals while sandstones with coarse grains contain very few clay minerals 47 besides other research showed that sandstones are heavily compacted being carbonates and clay minerals the predominant pore filling diagenetic cements 25 45 in addition the intergranular pores intragranular pores microfractures and micropores of sandstones 25 could explain the different behavior of each size particle finally the three particle sizes had a different effect on metals precipitation when calcareous crust was used fig 5 concentrations of cu zn cd and as were higher for 10 20 mm particle size than for the other two particle sizes however metals in amd were not completely eliminated in any case in contrast concentrations of fe and pb were almost eliminated from amd especially pb the main reason for this behavior is likely due to that calcareous crust grains are rapidly coated with a thin layer of iron prevented a efficient precipitation of the rest of metals 45 3 4 effectiveness of acid neutralization and metals arsenic immobilization taking into account the concentrations of the studied metal loid s before and after amd treatment by alkaline materials marl sandstone and calcareous crust and for a size particle of 10 20 mm metals mainly removed were pb fe and cu with a removal percentage close to 100 table 2 other research evaluated the effectiveness of alkalis such as lime sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate concluded that 99 7 of fe was removed 14 others found that 63 6 of fe was removal when stainless steel slag was applied compared to 99 7 fe removal when basic oxygen furnace slag was used 11 in addition it was evaluated the potential use of pervious concrete for treating amd and reported a removal efficiency of 98 for fe in an amd collected from a gold mine and 87 for a amd from a coalfield 44 similarly significant reductions were obtained with cement kiln dust lime kiln dust red mud bauxite coal fly ash and blast furnace slag which removed over 99 of cd cu fe and zn 9 considering the results of the total efficiencies in the treatment of amd with powdered limestone and limewater ca oh 2 45 the lower as efficiencies of removal were identified in accordance with our results table 2 another study showed that recycled concrete aggregates treatment decreased cu concentrations in amd by 33 80 and zn concentrations by over 95 while fly ash treatment reduced cu concentrations by 99 10 for marl and sandstone used in this study zn and cd were removal about 60 in amd while calcareous crust had a removal efficiency of 40 to zn although the efficiencies were high for all alkaline materials marl showed the best results likely because of its less cementation however zn as and cd were not completely eliminated therefore an additional treatment using chemicals should be evaluate to increase the removal effectivity 9 however at industrial scale the use of these materials as passive treatment could be enough to minimize the environmental impacts of amd this passive treatment would consist in the construction of alkaline channels using calcareous crust sandstone and marl where the amd would circulate by gravity only it would be recommendable increase the contact time between these materials and the amd to ensure acid neutralization and metals precipitation in addition a monitoring plan should be designed to assess the state of the alkaline material to replace it when excessive degradation is observed or when the efficiency of metal removal is below expected 3 5 influence of contact time between alkaline materials amd evolution of metals and arsenic concentrations vs contact time for the three alkaline materials used for amd reclamation is showed in fig 6 six minutes contact time was necessary to most of metal loid s concentration decreased in amd when marl was used although in the first minute the highest reductions were observed copper decreased considerably in the first minute as well as fe cadmium was progressively reduced and as and pb were eliminated in amd after 6 min contact time sandstone had a similar behavior than marl to minimize metal loid s from amd however the necessary time to get similar reductions was 4 min when amd was treated with calcareous crust fe and pb were eliminated at 19 min copper quickly decreased in the first two minutes while cd and zn showed a progressive decrease the longer time of neutralization compared with the previous materials is due to calcareous crust is more difficult to disintegrate since it is more compact and harder than marls and sandstone and therefore react more slowly than the previous alkali materials in spite of its high carbonates concentration other studies performed with carbide lime which contains 94 3 of cao and with a metals concentration about 0 5 2 5 g l 1 needed between 5 70 min of reaction time to decrease metals 40 similarly the use of eggshells required 40 min to achieve complete removal of fe 30 4 conclusions results showed that all alkaline materials tested marl sandstone and calcareous crust can be used for amd rehabilitation due to its high capability to increase ph and decrease metal loid s concentration by precipitation however fe cu zn as cd and pb concentrations in amd treated with marl were lower than those reported when sandstone and calcareous crust were used in addition the behavior of metals was different zn and cd decreased progressively from ph 4 to ph 6 5 while fe cu and pb did it suddenly when ph was 5 5 oppositely arsenic behavior was different to the previous metals which depended on alkaline material used to treat amd the optimal particle size for metals removing from amd when marl was used was 20 30 mm however fe cu and pb were removed from amd for all particle sizes while zn as and cd had lower concentrations for this size which suggested that the higher amount of carbonate in the largest particles of marl promoted a higher co pecipitation of metals sandstone allowed a high reduction of metal loid s in amd for all particle size being fe cu and pb specially decreased for 10 20 mm however zn cd and as had similar reductions in amd for the three particle size finally although fe and pb were similarly removed for all particle size when amd was treated with calcareous crust the behavior of the rest of metal loid s was variable which was likely due to calcareous crust grains are rapidly coated with a thin layer of iron prevented an efficient precipitation of the rest of metals the removal efficiency of the three alkaline materials with a size particle of 10 20 mm was close to 100 for pb fe and cu however sandstone reduced zn and cd about 60 in amd and calcareous crust had a removal efficiency of 40 for zn in order to increase the removal efficacy of these metals additional treatment using chemicals should be evaluate however at large scale it would be recommendable increase the contact time between these materials and the amd to ensure acid neutralization and metals precipitation marl and sandstone showed the shortest contact time with amd for full neutralization allowing a fast precipitation of metal loid s oppositely although calcareous crust has a carbonates concentration of 98 needed longer contact time to achieve the neutralization and metals precipitation which was due to a more compact structure and harder consistence than marls and sandstone declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
14191,this study investigated the adsorbent feasibility of fe nano zeolite fe nz for the treatment of phenolic compounds in wastewaters the maximum adsorption capacities of phenol ph 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 2 nitrophenol 2 np using fe nz were 138 7 158 9 and 171 2 mg g respectively from analyzing the regeneration characteristics of organic pollutant loaded fe nz the desorption efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np were maintained at 46 3 50 9 and 55 7 respectively even after 10 adsorption desorption cycles when fe nz and activated carbon ac were applied for the removal of ph 2 cp and 2 np in wastewater at high concentrations of 425 327 and 368 mg l the removal efficiencies were 62 3 70 1 and 82 5 respectively which were much higher than those of ac alone 45 9 61 5 and 68 7 respectively the cost for the adsorption treatment of wastewaters containing the three phenolic compounds was much lower using fe nz than using ac these results demonstrate the promising potential of fe nz as a low cost and effective adsorbent for removing phenolic compounds in wastewaters keywords fe nano zeolite economic effect 2 chlorophenol phenol wastewaters adsorption cost 1 introduction phenolic compounds are used in many industrials process and have been have been extensively discharged into wastewaters from oil refineries the paint drug and pesticide industries 1 3 the frequent abuse of phenolic compounds has aroused extensive concerns due to its potential threat to the health and safety of aquatic organisms 4 5 among the phenolic compounds phenol ph chlorophenol cp and nitrophenol np have been widely utilized in industrial processes to obtain petrochemical products synthetic rubber plastics textiles and especially pulp and paper 6 7 chlorophenols may cause inflammation in the digestive system and increased blood pressure nitrophenols can reduce the ability of the blood to carry oxygen to tissues and organs because of their toxicity they must be removed from industrial wastewater before being discharged into the environment 8 9 due to the high toxicity for environment and human phenolic compounds should be completely removed from wastewater before discharge into environment 10 various processes including advanced oxidation membrane filtration biological degradation electrochemical oxidation photocatalytic degradation and adsorption have been applied to remove phenolic compounds from water the adsorption process has been reported as an efficient method for removing organic pollutants from water 11 12 activated carbons acs are widely used as an adsorbent with high adsorption abilities for removing organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds however the high costs for the regeneration system render active carbons less economically viable as an adsorbent several studies have searched for low cost adsorbents that do not require a complicated regeneration system and avoid high disposal costs after use natural zeolites have attracted attention for removing organic and inorganic pollutants because of their high sorption capacity larger specific surface area and high selectivity for water and or other molecules zeolites have been applied to a broad range of industrial sectors and water treatments as catalysts adsorbents molecular sieves and ion exchangers recent research interest has focused on different aspects in the synthesis of nano crystalline zeolites which have favorable properties for adsorption processes the outer surface area of nano crystalline zeolite increases with decreasing crystal size which supports the application of nano zeolite nz to remove phenolic compounds however partial replacement of si4 by al3 in the zeolite structure results in an excess of negative charge that hinders the adsorption of phenolic compounds 6 8 10 the metals cation supported nz could decrease the excess negative charge of nz and thereby improve its phenolic compounds adsorption capacity it is challenging to provide a potential adsorbent with low cost high adsorption capacity and environmentally friendly for the removal of phenolic compounds in wastewaters the novelty of the present study are following 1 to evaluate the feasibility of using fe nano zeolite fe nz as an adsorbent for removing phenol ph 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 2 nitrophenol 2 np in wastewaters 2 provide the mechanism for removal of phenolic compounds using fe nz 3 evaluation of adsorption cost for phenolic compounds in wastewater using fe nz and activated carbon which was widely used for adsorption of organic pollutants in addition various adsorption parameters such as solution ph reaction time adsorbent dose initial concentration and adsorption kinetics were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium aluminate salt 63 al2o3 and silica sol sigma aldrich were used as aluminum and silicon sources respectively sodium hydroxide ph 2 cp 2 np ethanol and iron nitrate at analytical grade were obtained from dapchem chemical co ltd and used as received without further purification an aqueous solution with a 1000 mg l concentration of ph 2 cp or 2 np was prepared by mixing an appropriate amount of adsorbate with distilled

microscope transmission electron microscopy tem jeol tem model 3200 was used to determine the particle size and morphology inside the nanocrystals a drop of dilute sample suspension in methanol was placed on a carbon coated copper grid grid tech and dried at room temperature prior to the measurement the images were recorded at the accelerating voltage of 120 kv the icp spectroscopy varian 642 es icp oes was used to determine the iron concentration ex change in nano zeolite and si al ratios of the materials the micro porosity and bet specific surface were carried out by n2 adsorption by using autosorb model ae200 2 4 adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments were conducted by mixing 0 5 g fe nz with 200 ml of the solutions containing known phenolic compound concentrations the ph of the solutions was adjusted in range of 2 0 10 to optimize the adsorption adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the effects of contact time 10 300 min the effects of the initial concentration in the solution were investigated over the concentration range of 10 500 mg l after adsorption experiments all samples were taken out and filtered using whatman 45 filter paper for each set of experiments the phenolic compounds concentrations in the solution were analyzed by monitoring the absorbance at 270 280 and 350 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 2100 to measure ph 2 cp and 2 np concentrations respectively the removal percentage of phenolic compounds from the interest solution was calculated using the following eq 1 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c e c 0 100 the equilibrium amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent was calculated as follows eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where qe mg g is the equilibrium amount of adsorbate v the volume of the solution l c0 the initial concentration mg l ce the equilibrium concentration mg l and w the weight of the adsorbent g the langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the equilibrium

01 wt 02 and wt 03 were collected from wastewater treatment plants in hanoi vietnam the ph total organic carbon toc and biochemical oxygen demand bod in the wastewaters were analyzed using standard procedures apha 2005 the concentrations of ph 2 cp and 2 np were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 324e characterization of the obtained wastewater is shown in table 5 the main phenolic compounds in the wt 01 wt 02 and wt 03 samples were ph 2 cp and 2 np respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 xrd morphology tem and icp oes analysis 3 1 1 the xrd analysis xrd was used to analyze the crystallinity of fe nz refer to supporting information fig s1 the peaks at 2Œ∏ values of 23 5 30 1 and 54 3 showed the aluminate of fe nz 13 14 the peaks at 2Œ∏ 7 10 corresponded to the specific peaks of al3 and si4 of the adsorbent the high intensity of the peak at 2Œ∏ 33 8 represented the fe3 loaded nz 6 8 the peaks in the fe nz structure indicated a structure similar to that of nz zms 5 6 8 13 14 fig s1 also presented the xrd analysis of fe nz after 10 time recycles the intensity of the diffraction peaks were quite similar as compared with the original material before the reaction the result from xrd confirmed that fe nz could be utilized as long term adsorbent for removal of organic pollutants in the analysis of the appearance of fe nz observed in the sem image shown in fig 1 a the fe nz morphology was mostly presented as almost spherical shapes with good size uniformity around 100 nm transmission electron microscopy images reveal more information about the composition of the nano zeolite crystal aggregates and the size of individual crystal tem images of fe nz showed particle size at around 100 nm and the nanoparticles were spherical shaped fig 1b the icp oes analysis was carried out to determine amount of iron in nano zeolite and the ratio between irons in case of silicon to aluminum table 2 the si al ratio in nano zeolite slightly increases after irons ions exchange due to higher some dealumination in general the si al ratio had high effect in adsorption process and the adsorption of phenolic compounds may increase with increasing in the si al ratio 15 16 finally the bet analysis was conducted to check the specific area of fe nz from table 2 it can be observed the specific area of fe nz was very high 981 m2 g leading to improve the adsorption capacity of phenolic compounds in wastewaters 6 9 3 2 effect of ph reaction time and initial concentrations 3 2 1 effect of solution ph the solution ph strongly influences the adsorption process between adsorbent surfaces and the pollutant 18 the removal efficiencies were increased from 31 to 86 4 for ph 32 7 89 8 for 2 cp and 41 7 97 2 for 2 np as the solution ph was increased from 2 0 5 0 the sorption removal peaked at ph 5 0 and then decreased by 58 18 27 83 and 32 38 at ph 10 for ph 2 cp and 2 np respectively fig 2 the surface of the fe nz has the point of zero charge phpzc at around ph 5 03 0 1 see in supporting information text s2 and fig s2 thus the decrease in hydronium ion concentration with increasing ph in the acidic solution ph 5 0 could increase the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged surface of the adsorbent and the negative charge of the phenolic compounds and thus increase the removal efficiencies the adsorbent surface starts to build a partial negative charge at ph higher than phpzc around ph 5 03 so that increasing solution ph strengthens the repulsion on the surface of fe nz with increased hydroxyl anions however the pka values of ph 2 cp and 2 np were 9 3 8 5 and 7 2 respectively when the ph increased above their pka phenolic compounds existed in anion form with more negative charge leading to more repulsion with the anionic charge of the adsorbent and thus decreased removal efficiencies in particular at ph higher than ph 8 5 the removal efficiencies of 2 cp and 2 np which existed as the anion form sharply decreased 6 8 11 15 however ph with relatively more positive ions than 2 cp and 2 np in alkaline ph range ph 9 0 suffered a smaller decrease in the removal efficiency fig 2 3 2 2 effect of contact time adsorption experiments were performed in 100 ml of ph 2 cp and 2 np solution of 200 mg l with varying contact time from 10 to 300 min fig 3 shows the effect of different reaction times on the adsorption of ph 2 cp and 2 np onto fe nz the adsorption was rapid and nearly completed in 230 min which is an almost adsorption equilibrium the removal efficiencies at equilibrium of ph 2 cp and 2 np using fe nz were 82 6 91 8 and 97 9 respectively the ph 2 cp and 2 np adsorption rates were high in the beginning of the adsorption experiment because more adsorption sites were initially available 17 20 after that the remaining vacant surface sites of the adsorbent were not easily available for further ph 2 cp and 2 np removal due to blocking and the repulsion by the molecules adsorbed already on the surface of fe nz thus further adsorption experiments were performed for 230 min which was considered the optimum contact time 3 2 2 1 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics is one of the most important datasets for elucidating the removal adsorption mechanism of phenol and assessing the performance of the adsorbents 18 22 the adsorption kinetics parameters were calculated by two common rate law equations pseudo first order and second order kinetic models and the results are presented in table 3 it can be see that the pseudo second order equation provides much better agreement between calculated qe values and the experimental data compared to the pseudo first order equation also the determination coefficients for the second order r2 0 98 0 99 were greater than the first order kinetic model r2 0 71 0 82 these results indicate that the adsorption of phenolic compounds by fe nz followed the second order kinetic model rather than the first order model 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dose fig 4 shows the relationship between adsorbent dose and the removal efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np using fe nz at different adsorbent doses 0 05 1 g the removal efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np per unit weight of adsorbent rapidly increased up to 88 9 93 4 and 96 3 as the fe nz dose was increased to 0 5 g the increase in surface area increased the adsorbent mass or the number of adsorption sites for a given concentration of adsorbate onto the adsorbent above a dosage of 0 5 g the percentage removal of ph 2 cp and 2 np was not further increased because the active sites adsorption are blocked or overlapped at a high dosage 25 hence 0 5 g of fe nz was chosen as the optimum dosage for further experiments 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration fig 5 shows the adsorption capacities of ph 2 cp and 2 np using fe nz as a function of the initial concentrations at low initial concentrations less than 250 mg l more unoccupied surface areas or active sites are available for removal of phenolic compounds the increase in initial concentrations increased the adsorption capacity at initial concentrations above 300 mg l any further increase only slightly increased their adsorption capacities this can be explained because all active sites for further adsorption were almost occupied or saturated by adsorbates 26 27 thus the driving forces of the further approaches of the phenolic compounds toward the active binding sites are greatly weakened and hence any further adsorption is only slightly increased 3 3 adsorption isotherm the langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms models were used to simulate the adsorption systems in general an adsorption isotherm model is distinguished by the respective parameters that indicate the affinity and surface properties of the particular adsorbent used 28 29 fig 6 and table 4 show the adsorption isotherm results and their data fitting of the two adsorption models the coefficients of determination r2 of the langmuir isotherm model were much higher r2 0 99 0 97 than those of the freundlich model r2 0 87 0 79 based on the langmuir equation the maximum adsorption capacities of ph 2 cp and 2 np were 138 7 158 9 and 171 2 mg g respectively the adsorption capacities increased in the order above due to the different properties of dipole moment and functional groups oh cl and no2 of ph 2 cp and 2 np see in table 1 the dipole moment of 2 np 3 01 is much larger than that of 2 cp 1 13 and ph 1 22 thus 2 np has a stronger electrostatic attraction to fe nz which gives it the highest adsorption capacity among the three phenolics the adsorption capacity of 2 cp was also higher than that of ph because 2 cp has one more functional group cl which has more electronegativity and is thus available for further interaction with positive charged parts in fe nz hydrogen in oh groups and fe ions as compared ph leading to increased adsorption capacity 20 27 for further investigate the potential application of fe nz the comparisons of adsorption capacities for ph 2 cp 2 np using different type of zeolites were made refer to text s3 and table s1 3 4 adsorption mechanisms the adsorption mechanism for ph 2 cp and 2 np is dependent on the physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbent and the adsorbate 6 10 also the removal efficiency of organic pollutants was highly dependent on the solution ph at the weak acidic condition 4 0 ph 7 0 the adsorbates mostly exist in their molecular forms because the pka values of ph 2 cp and 2 np were 9 3 8 5 and 7 2 respectively thus their removal mechanism includes both physisorption and chemisorption 8 11 and 13 1 physisorption includes adsorption by surface areas active sites and van der waals forces between the adsorbates and adsorbent fe nz has high surface area numerous pores and active sites thus the adsorbates near the surface and the active sites of fe nz can get encapsulated into the pores of the adsorbent leading to physisorption 13 16 2 chemisorption results from short range interactions through additional complexation between h si4 al3 and fe3 ions on fe nz and the functional groups oh cl and no2 on the ph 2 cp and 2 np molecules fig s3 26 30 in the basic condition both the adsorbate and adsorbent have more negative charges and this increased electrostatic repulsion decreases the adsorption capacity in the strong acidic condition ph 3 0 the greater number of hydronium ions produced can compete with the phenolic compounds for adsorption sites of the adsorbent which further decreases their removal efficiency as described above in 3 2 effect of ph section 3 5 regeneration of loaded adsorbent in order to minimize the costs of the adsorption process the adsorbed ph 2 cp 2 np should be desorbed and the adsorbent fe nz should be regenerated for further adsorption desorption cycles 26 30 fig s4 shows the desorption efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np from these phenolic compound loaded fe nz samples even after 10 cycles of adsorption desorption the desorption efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np were 46 2 50 9 and 55 7 respectively the result showed that the high reusability and facile regeneration characteristics of fe nz

14191,this study investigated the adsorbent feasibility of fe nano zeolite fe nz for the treatment of phenolic compounds in wastewaters the maximum adsorption capacities of phenol ph 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 2 nitrophenol 2 np using fe nz were 138 7 158 9 and 171 2 mg g respectively from analyzing the regeneration characteristics of organic pollutant loaded fe nz the desorption efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np were maintained at 46 3 50 9 and 55 7 respectively even after 10 adsorption desorption cycles when fe nz and activated carbon ac were applied for the removal of ph 2 cp and 2 np in wastewater at high concentrations of 425 327 and 368 mg l the removal efficiencies were 62 3 70 1 and 82 5 respectively which were much higher than those of ac alone 45 9 61 5 and 68 7 respectively the cost for the adsorption treatment of wastewaters containing the three phenolic compounds was much lower using fe nz than using ac these results demonstrate the promising potential of fe nz as a low cost and effective adsorbent for removing phenolic compounds in wastewaters keywords fe nano zeolite economic effect 2 chlorophenol phenol wastewaters adsorption cost 1 introduction phenolic compounds are used in many industrials process and have been have been extensively discharged into wastewaters from oil refineries the paint drug and pesticide industries 1 3 the frequent abuse of phenolic compounds has aroused extensive concerns due to its potential threat to the health and safety of aquatic organisms 4 5 among the phenolic compounds phenol ph chlorophenol cp and nitrophenol np have been widely utilized in industrial processes to obtain petrochemical products synthetic rubber plastics textiles and especially pulp and paper 6 7 chlorophenols may cause inflammation in the digestive system and increased blood pressure nitrophenols can reduce the ability of the blood to carry oxygen to tissues and organs because of their toxicity they must be removed from industrial wastewater before being discharged into the environment 8 9 due to the high toxicity for environment and human phenolic compounds should be completely removed from wastewater before discharge into environment 10 various processes including advanced oxidation membrane filtration biological degradation electrochemical oxidation photocatalytic degradation and adsorption have been applied to remove phenolic compounds from water the adsorption process has been reported as an efficient method for removing organic pollutants from water 11 12 activated carbons acs are widely used as an adsorbent with high adsorption abilities for removing organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds however the high costs for the regeneration system render active carbons less economically viable as an adsorbent several studies have searched for low cost adsorbents that do not require a complicated regeneration system and avoid high disposal costs after use natural zeolites have attracted attention for removing organic and inorganic pollutants because of their high sorption capacity larger specific surface area and high selectivity for water and or other molecules zeolites have been applied to a broad range of industrial sectors and water treatments as catalysts adsorbents molecular sieves and ion exchangers recent research interest has focused on different aspects in the synthesis of nano crystalline zeolites which have favorable properties for adsorption processes the outer surface area of nano crystalline zeolite increases with decreasing crystal size which supports the application of nano zeolite nz to remove phenolic compounds however partial replacement of si4 by al3 in the zeolite structure results in an excess of negative charge that hinders the adsorption of phenolic compounds 6 8 10 the metals cation supported nz could decrease the excess negative charge of nz and thereby improve its phenolic compounds adsorption capacity it is challenging to provide a potential adsorbent with low cost high adsorption capacity and environmentally friendly for the removal of phenolic compounds in wastewaters the novelty of the present study are following 1 to evaluate the feasibility of using fe nano zeolite fe nz as an adsorbent for removing phenol ph 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 2 nitrophenol 2 np in wastewaters 2 provide the mechanism for removal of phenolic compounds using fe nz 3 evaluation of adsorption cost for phenolic compounds in wastewater using fe nz and activated carbon which was widely used for adsorption of organic pollutants in addition various adsorption parameters such as solution ph reaction time adsorbent dose initial concentration and adsorption kinetics were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium aluminate salt 63 al2o3 and silica sol sigma aldrich were used as aluminum and silicon sources respectively sodium hydroxide ph 2 cp 2 np ethanol and iron nitrate at analytical grade were obtained from dapchem chemical co ltd and used as received without further purification an aqueous solution with a 1000 mg l concentration of ph 2 cp or 2 np was prepared by mixing an appropriate amount of adsorbate with distilled water fresh stock solution as required was prepared immediately before use in the experiments 2 2 synthesis of fe nano zeolite fe nz the fe nz was synthesized based on previously reported method 6 8 10 the details of synthesis method is shown in the supporting information refer to text s1 2 3 characterization of adsorbent the crystallinity of fe nz was determined by powder x ray diffraction xrd

microscope transmission electron microscopy tem jeol tem model 3200 was used to determine the particle size and morphology inside the nanocrystals a drop of dilute sample suspension in methanol was placed on a carbon coated copper grid grid tech and dried at room temperature prior to the measurement the images were recorded at the accelerating voltage of 120 kv the icp spectroscopy varian 642 es icp oes was used to determine the iron concentration ex change in nano zeolite and si al ratios of the materials the micro porosity and bet specific surface were carried out by n2 adsorption by using autosorb model ae200 2 4 adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments were conducted by mixing 0 5 g fe nz with 200 ml of the solutions containing known phenolic compound concentrations the ph of the solutions was adjusted in range of 2 0 10 to optimize the adsorption adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the effects of contact time 10 300 min the effects of the initial concentration in the solution were investigated over the concentration range of 10 500 mg l after adsorption experiments all samples were taken out and filtered using whatman 45 filter paper for each set of experiments the phenolic compounds concentrations in the solution were analyzed by monitoring the absorbance at 270 280 and 350 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 2100 to measure ph 2 cp and 2 np concentrations respectively the removal percentage of phenolic compounds from the interest solution was calculated using the following eq 1 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c e c 0 100 the equilibrium amount of adsorbate per unit mass of adsorbent was calculated as follows eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where qe mg g is the equilibrium amount of adsorbate v the volume of the solution l c0 the initial concentration mg l ce the equilibrium concentration mg l and w the weight of the adsorbent g the langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms were used to analyze the equilibrium

concentration of adsorbed and cd mg l represents the final concentration of ph 2 cp and 2 np identified in the desorption medium 2 5 field application three different industrial wastewaters namely wt 01 wt 02 and wt 03 were collected from wastewater treatment plants in hanoi vietnam the ph total organic carbon toc and biochemical oxygen demand bod in the wastewaters were analyzed using standard procedures apha 2005 the concentrations of ph 2 cp and 2 np were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 324e characterization of the obtained wastewater is shown in table 5 the main phenolic compounds in the wt 01 wt 02 and wt 03 samples were ph 2 cp and 2 np respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 xrd morphology tem and icp oes analysis 3 1 1 the xrd analysis xrd was used to analyze the crystallinity of fe nz refer to supporting information fig s1 the peaks at 2Œ∏ values of 23 5 30 1 and 54 3 showed the aluminate of fe nz 13 14 the peaks at 2Œ∏ 7 10 corresponded to the specific peaks of al3 and si4 of the adsorbent the high intensity of the peak at 2Œ∏ 33 8 represented the fe3 loaded nz 6 8 the peaks in the fe nz structure indicated a structure similar to that of nz zms 5 6 8 13 14 fig s1 also presented the xrd analysis of fe nz after 10 time recycles the intensity of the diffraction peaks were quite similar as compared with the original material before the reaction the result from xrd confirmed that fe nz could be utilized as long term adsorbent for removal of organic pollutants in the analysis of the appearance of fe nz observed in the sem image shown in fig 1 a the fe nz morphology was mostly presented as almost spherical shapes with good size uniformity around 100 nm transmission electron microscopy images reveal more information about the composition of the nano zeolite crystal aggregates and the size of individual crystal tem images of fe nz showed particle size at around 100 nm and the nanoparticles were spherical shaped fig 1b the icp oes analysis was carried out to determine amount of iron in nano zeolite and the ratio between irons in case of silicon to aluminum table 2 the si al ratio in nano zeolite slightly increases after irons ions exchange due to higher some dealumination in general the si al ratio had high effect in adsorption process and the adsorption of phenolic compounds may increase with increasing in the si al ratio 15 16 finally the bet analysis was conducted to check the specific area of fe nz from table 2 it can be observed the specific area of fe nz was very high 981 m2 g leading to improve the adsorption capacity of phenolic compounds in wastewaters 6 9 3 2 effect of ph reaction time and initial concentrations 3 2 1 effect of solution ph the solution ph strongly influences the adsorption process between adsorbent surfaces and the pollutant 18 the removal efficiencies were increased from 31 to 86 4 for ph 32 7 89 8 for 2 cp and 41 7 97 2 for 2 np as the solution ph was increased from 2 0 5 0 the sorption removal peaked at ph 5 0 and then decreased by 58 18 27 83 and 32 38 at ph 10 for ph 2 cp and 2 np respectively fig 2 the surface of the fe nz has the point of zero charge phpzc at around ph 5 03 0 1 see in supporting information text s2 and fig s2 thus the decrease in hydronium ion concentration with increasing ph in the acidic solution ph 5 0 could increase the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged surface of the adsorbent and the negative charge of the phenolic compounds and thus increase the removal efficiencies the adsorbent surface starts to build a partial negative charge at ph higher than phpzc around ph 5 03 so that increasing solution ph strengthens the repulsion on the surface of fe nz with increased hydroxyl anions however the pka values of ph 2 cp and 2 np were 9 3 8 5 and 7 2 respectively when the ph increased above their pka phenolic compounds existed in anion form with more negative charge leading to more repulsion with the anionic charge of the adsorbent and thus decreased removal efficiencies in particular at ph higher than ph 8 5 the removal efficiencies of 2 cp and 2 np which existed as the anion form sharply decreased 6 8 11 15 however ph with relatively more positive ions than 2 cp and 2 np in alkaline ph range ph 9 0 suffered a smaller decrease in the removal efficiency fig 2 3 2 2 effect of contact time adsorption experiments were performed in 100 ml of ph 2 cp and 2 np solution of 200 mg l with varying contact time from 10 to 300 min fig 3 shows the effect of different reaction times on the adsorption of ph 2 cp and 2 np onto fe nz the adsorption was rapid and nearly completed in 230 min which is an almost adsorption equilibrium the removal efficiencies at equilibrium of ph 2 cp and 2 np using fe nz were 82 6 91 8 and 97 9 respectively the ph 2 cp and 2 np adsorption rates were high in the beginning of the adsorption experiment because more adsorption sites were initially available 17 20 after that the remaining vacant surface sites of the adsorbent were not easily available for further ph 2 cp and 2 np removal due to blocking and the repulsion by the molecules adsorbed already on the surface of fe nz thus further adsorption experiments were performed for 230 min which was considered the optimum contact time 3 2 2 1 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics is one of the most important datasets for elucidating the removal adsorption mechanism of phenol and assessing the performance of the adsorbents 18 22 the adsorption kinetics parameters were calculated by two common rate law equations pseudo first order and second order kinetic models and the results are presented in table 3 it can be see that the pseudo second order equation provides much better agreement between calculated qe values and the experimental data compared to the pseudo first order equation also the determination coefficients for the second order r2 0 98 0 99 were greater than the first order kinetic model r2 0 71 0 82 these results indicate that the adsorption of phenolic compounds by fe nz followed the second order kinetic model rather than the first order model 3 2 3 effect of adsorbent dose fig 4 shows the relationship between adsorbent dose and the removal efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np using fe nz at different adsorbent doses 0 05 1 g the removal efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np per unit weight of adsorbent rapidly increased up to 88 9 93 4 and 96 3 as the fe nz dose was increased to 0 5 g the increase in surface area increased the adsorbent mass or the number of adsorption sites for a given concentration of adsorbate onto the adsorbent above a dosage of 0 5 g the percentage removal of ph 2 cp and 2 np was not further increased because the active sites adsorption are blocked or overlapped at a high dosage 25 hence 0 5 g of fe nz was chosen as the optimum dosage for further experiments 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration fig 5 shows the adsorption capacities of ph 2 cp and 2 np using fe nz as a function of the initial concentrations at low initial concentrations less than 250 mg l more unoccupied surface areas or active sites are available for removal of phenolic compounds the increase in initial concentrations increased the adsorption capacity at initial concentrations above 300 mg l any further increase only slightly increased their adsorption capacities this can be explained because all active sites for further adsorption were almost occupied or saturated by adsorbates 26 27 thus the driving forces of the further approaches of the phenolic compounds toward the active binding sites are greatly weakened and hence any further adsorption is only slightly increased 3 3 adsorption isotherm the langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms models were used to simulate the adsorption systems in general an adsorption isotherm model is distinguished by the respective parameters that indicate the affinity and surface properties of the particular adsorbent used 28 29 fig 6 and table 4 show the adsorption isotherm results and their data fitting of the two adsorption models the coefficients of determination r2 of the langmuir isotherm model were much higher r2 0 99 0 97 than those of the freundlich model r2 0 87 0 79 based on the langmuir equation the maximum adsorption capacities of ph 2 cp and 2 np were 138 7 158 9 and 171 2 mg g respectively the adsorption capacities increased in the order above due to the different properties of dipole moment and functional groups oh cl and no2 of ph 2 cp and 2 np see in table 1 the dipole moment of 2 np 3 01 is much larger than that of 2 cp 1 13 and ph 1 22 thus 2 np has a stronger electrostatic attraction to fe nz which gives it the highest adsorption capacity among the three phenolics the adsorption capacity of 2 cp was also higher than that of ph because 2 cp has one more functional group cl which has more electronegativity and is thus available for further interaction with positive charged parts in fe nz hydrogen in oh groups and fe ions as compared ph leading to increased adsorption capacity 20 27 for further investigate the potential application of fe nz the comparisons of adsorption capacities for ph 2 cp 2 np using different type of zeolites were made refer to text s3 and table s1 3 4 adsorption mechanisms the adsorption mechanism for ph 2 cp and 2 np is dependent on the physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbent and the adsorbate 6 10 also the removal efficiency of organic pollutants was highly dependent on the solution ph at the weak acidic condition 4 0 ph 7 0 the adsorbates mostly exist in their molecular forms because the pka values of ph 2 cp and 2 np were 9 3 8 5 and 7 2 respectively thus their removal mechanism includes both physisorption and chemisorption 8 11 and 13 1 physisorption includes adsorption by surface areas active sites and van der waals forces between the adsorbates and adsorbent fe nz has high surface area numerous pores and active sites thus the adsorbates near the surface and the active sites of fe nz can get encapsulated into the pores of the adsorbent leading to physisorption 13 16 2 chemisorption results from short range interactions through additional complexation between h si4 al3 and fe3 ions on fe nz and the functional groups oh cl and no2 on the ph 2 cp and 2 np molecules fig s3 26 30 in the basic condition both the adsorbate and adsorbent have more negative charges and this increased electrostatic repulsion decreases the adsorption capacity in the strong acidic condition ph 3 0 the greater number of hydronium ions produced can compete with the phenolic compounds for adsorption sites of the adsorbent which further decreases their removal efficiency as described above in 3 2 effect of ph section 3 5 regeneration of loaded adsorbent in order to minimize the costs of the adsorption process the adsorbed ph 2 cp 2 np should be desorbed and the adsorbent fe nz should be regenerated for further adsorption desorption cycles 26 30 fig s4 shows the desorption efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np from these phenolic compound loaded fe nz samples even after 10 cycles of adsorption desorption the desorption efficiencies of ph 2 cp and 2 np were 46 2 50 9 and 55 7 respectively the result showed that the high reusability and facile regeneration characteristics of fe nz supports its potential use as an adsorbent for the removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous solution 3 6 field application feasibility analysis the field application feasibility of fe nz and ac was analyzed by monitoring their adsorption capacity and adsorption cost to remove ph 2 cp and 2 np contained in wastewater samples the details of discussions are displayed in supporting information text s4 table s2 and fig s5 3 7 the practical applications and future research water shortages have become a global issue in recent years and wastewater and clean water are recognized as water resources 1 3 it is becoming a global challenge to develop more efficient and cost effective wastewater treatment processes of organic pollutants phenolic compounds are used in many industrials process and have been have been extensively discharged into wastewaters and they are listed as priority pollutants due to their high toxicity and carcinogenicity properties therefore the development technology for the removal of phenolic pollutants is important solves the environmental issues as well as protects human health zeolites are of great interest due to their unique properties such as ion exchange adsorption and catalysis the reduction of the particles size in the nanozeolite showed a larger of specific area and high reactive site leading to improve the removal efficiency of pollutants 8 14 the synthesis fe nz displayed high removal efficiency for phenol chlorophenol and nitrophenol in wastewater the low cost of adsorbent as compared to activated carbon and simple operation process for treatment of phenolic pollutants supported fe nz could be used as a promising adsorbent for treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater however the result still needs improve to expand the potential application of fe nz for environmental 1 to study on the optimum modification method to synthesis fe nz 2 to study on the removal of other toxic organic pollutants using fe nz 3 to perform study in for removal of heavy metals in wastewater or removal of other toxic pollutants in the air 4 to study on the removal mechanism for heavy metals and other organic pollutants 5 to evaluate the negative effect of fe nz for environment 4 conclusions fe nz showed maximum adsorption capacities of 138 5 158 9 and 171 2 mg g for ph 2 cp and 2 np respectively fe nz also showed high reusability with desorption efficiency remaining above 46 even after 10 adsorption desorption cycles in the field application for the treatment of the wastewaters containing larger amount of ph 2 cp and 2 np fe nz displayed high removal efficiencies of 62 3 70 1 and 82 5 respectively which were much higher than those 45 9 61 5 and 68 7 of ac the simply estimated adsorption costs required to treat the phenolic

14192,simultaneous nitrification and denitrification coupled to fe redox cycling was achieved by activated sludge flocs sourced from a sequential batch reactor sbr treating domestic sewage and with less efficiency using the sludge from various environments this novel process involves bio catalytic oxidation of nh4 n using nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides under anoxic environment in a sbr nh4 n oxidation is associated with biogenic fe iii reduction and simultaneous fe ii oxidation which is inturn associated with no2 n and or no3 n reduction the internal recycling of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides makes nh4 n removal to undergo multiple cycles the synthesized oxides were identified as feooh based on xps data and have an average size of 30 nm the nh4 n and total nitrogen removals obtained were 73 1 17 4 mg l d and 68 2 16 9 mg l d respectively optimum conditions for nh4 n removal were at ph of 7 and temperature of 25 30 c the inhibition effects of nh4 n no2 n and s2 on anoxic nh4 n removal and the possibility of recovery from inhibition were also studied and discussed this process does not require oxygen and alkalinity and hence is inexpensive compared to other existing techniques keywords nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides anoxic ammonia removal sequencing batch reactor nitrification denitrification inhibition 1 introduction contamination of waterbodies by nh4 n has become a significant environmental threat for example the presence of nh4 n causes depletion of dissolved oxygen eutrophication of lakes and toxicity to fishes 1 therefore nh4 n should be removed from wastewaters before discharging in to the surface waters biological processes for nh4 n removal are cheaper compared to physico chemical processes in the conventional nitrification denitrification process nh4 n gets converted into no3 n by nitrifiers using o2 and then no3 n gets transformed subsequently into n2 gas by denitrifiers however this process requires relatively high input of energy to maintain high dissolved oxygen levels for nitrification 2 and periodic failures are reported as the process is sensitive to ph temperature and toxic substances also some time external addition of chemicals are required for ph regulation and effective denitrifcation therefore development of an alternative anoxic ammonia removal process which requires less input of energy and chemical is desirable in the marine and soil sediments an alternative for nitrification and denitrification pathway is reported using redox metals acting as catalysts 3 7 studies indicating the coupling of fe and n in biogeochemical cycles under anoxic conditions have attracted increased attention of researchers several studies have reported that under anoxic conditions iron reducing bacteria play an important role in biogeochemical cycles of n2 and carbon in aquatic ecosystems 8 anoxic oxidation of nh4 n mediated by microbes and metal oxides occurs through a well established sequence of primary redox reactions and they produce reduced metal by products these reduced species sequentially take part in a variety of secondary reactions for instance in the presence of fe oxides hydroxides nh4 n gets oxidized to no2 n no3 n or n2 and gives fe ii as a by product this fe ii will inturn reduce no2 n and no3 n to n2 and produces fe iii 9 10 this series of reactions will lead to simultaneous nitrification denitrification and recycling of fe oxides hydroxides microbes make use of fe iii as external electron acceptor in metabolism under anoxic conditions and thereby reducing fe iii to fe ii easily microbes performing this dissimilatory fe iii reduction obtains energy for growth iron oxidizing bacteria are reported to mediate the fe ii oxidation to fe iii using no2 n or no3 n as electron acceptors in the last two decades substantial research was undertaken towards understanding the biogeochemical mechanisms that facilitate anoxic fe iii dependent ammonium oxidation in environment the discovery of this interesting phenomena dates back to 1990 s when excess unaccounted dinitrogen was detected under anoxic conditions in marine waters in the absence of oxidized nitrogen species that are required for denitrification and anammox thermodynamic calculations pointed toward this new pathway involving metals and metal oxides of environmental abundance as electron acceptors 11 12 the initial studies were limited to batch incubations using the sediments collected from marine ecosystems simultaneous organic oxidation and dissimilatory fe iii reduction coupled with microbial growth in the presence of acetate was first reported by lovley and phillips 13 by conducting anaerobic batch experiments using marine sediments in the form of amorphous fe oxides and fe oxyhydroxides cl√©ment et al 5 performed anaerobic batch experiments using riparian forest soils and amended urea as nitrogen source they observed fe ii and temporary no2 spikes that quickly transformed in to gaseous n2 without formation of no3 leading to total nitrogen removal which led to the confirmation that fe iii reduction was coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation to no2 similarly in another study sawayama 14 reported the nh4 oxidation and no2 generation in the presence of fe iii edtana mediated by iron reducing bacteria of genus exiguobacterium in an anoxic fixed bed reactor containing anaerobically digested sludge collected from a cattle waste treatment plant and this process was termed as feammox park et al 15 related the increased nitrite and nitrate levels in an anaerobic batch reactor with piggery wastewater culture fe iii citrate and ammonium to feammox and the resultant anammox process enhanced in the presence of bicarbonate leading to oxidation of 0 33 mol nh4 mol fe iii reduced indeed the tracer studies conducted by yang et al 16 in tropical upland soil slurries incubated with ammonium and exogenous fe iii proved the role of feammox process in the significant loss of nitrogen owing to nitrogen removal of 1 20 0 28 mg n g d this feammox process was also reported to occur in highly cultivated paddy soils as they are rich in iron oxides batch incubations by ding et al 17 shown the occurrence of feammox related no2 or no3 production followed by anammox or denitrification leading to removal of 0 17 to 0 59 mg n kg d and this reaction can still be enhanced by the addition of electron shuttles like 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds or biochar 18 19 through batch and continuous flow membrane reactor experiments using forest riparian wetland sediments huang and jaffe 20 confirmed the occurrence of nh4 oxidation coupled to fe iii reduction followed by denitrification and or anammox to give n2 by acidimicrobiaceae bacterium similarly batch experiments using sediments collected from oligotrophic reservoir shown simultaneous anaerobic fe iii reduction and nh4 oxidation in the presence of carbon source glucose mediated by klebsiella sp fc61 21 fe oxides were also reported to be involved in no2 no3 dependent fe ii oxidation this process was first demonstrated in enrichment cultures amended with fe ii from marine sediments and no3 22 this process was since been reported to occur in various freshwater and marine water environments and the species involved in this process are mostly mixotrophs that require an organic carbon source 23 this process gives n2 and fe iii as end products 24 though this reaction is mostly mediated by microbes abiotic reduction of nitrite to n2 coupled with fe ii oxidation was reported in few studies 25 for the process to be sustainable internal redox cycling of fe is essential most recent studies demonstrated the possibility of internal dynamic redox cycling of fe ii fe iii coupled to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification mejia et al 26 successfully achieved fe redox cycling in batch experiments with soil samples by creating alternating fe reducing and fe oxidizing environments using lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite and found that these processes were mediated by geobacter and dechloromonas respectively similarly lu et al 27 reported a heterogeneous fe redox cycling involving diverse processes like biotic conversion of fe ii to no2 by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and abiotic denitrification to give n2 gas leading to multiple fe ii fe iii cycles several anaerobic batch reactor studies demonstrated the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification coupled to fe oxides forming a fe ii fe iii redox cycle in the presence of various fe iii forms like magnetite ferrihydrite fe2o3 fe oh 3 mediated by fe reducing bacteria like geobacter pseudomonas desulfosporosinus dechloromonas and desulfomicrobium fe oxidizing bacteria like acidovorax and comamonadaceae anammox species like candidatus kuenenia candidatus scalindua candidatus brocadia candidatus brocadia and denitrifiers like acinetobacter rhodoplanes bacillus and pseudomonas 19 28 30 the above mentioned studies focussed on the occurrence of the process in natural environments in the presence of bulk fe oxides but not much work involving removal of nh4 n from wastewaters by nanoscale oxides of fe in engineered reactors was reported except the first work by the authors 31 in the reported study 31 an environmental friendly chemical approach was engaged to produce nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides embedded on chitosan nanosized metal oxides exhibit high surface area high reactivity and high affinity towards many pollutants 32 33 chitosan acts as a biopolymer support and gives nanostructures with improved properties like stability biocompatibility biodegradability and also reduces the toxicity 34 recently the dissimilatory fe iii reduction has been receiving increased attention due to its application in water and wastewater treatment 35 in this context this work reports the extension of the reported process 31 such as screening of biomass from various environmental compartments for anoxic ammonia removal and demonstration of the process in a sbr operation though this process is established by previous work the information on selection of seed biomass for start up the effects of major environmental parameters like ph and temperature of incoming wastewaters and the effect of inhibitory concentrations of certain compounds on the said process is not available accordingly all these parameters provide a rationale for scaling up the process as fluctuations of these parameters in influent wastewaters and or inside the reactor significantly affect the process hence the current study aims to establish the optimal degree of this new process by investigating the selection of seed biomass effect of ph temperature and inhibitory effects of nh4 n no2 n and s2 these aspects are studied and discussed which is significant in the propagation of this new process for engineering applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and mineral media fecl3 6h2o naoh

local perennial lake all the sludge from diverse background were collected stored in anoxic conditions transferred to the laboratory and were used immediately garden soil and lake sediments were processed by removing undesirable materials like pebbles roots etc then they were well mixed to suspend the microbes from the soil into the broth and allowed to settle for few minutes until most of the soil particles have settled the upper liquid broth was then used as inocula all the four batch reactors were seeded with nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides 1 g well mixed and prewashed sludge from the respective sources 30 ml and mineral media containing nh4 n to have an inital average concentration of 100 mg l in serum bottle serum bottles were purged with n2 for three minutes and sealed

used media was decanted and a fresh n2 purged mineral media was added nh4 n was measured at the end of each cycle the studies were done in duplicates and the average value is reported 2 3 2 sbr studies for anoxic nh4 n removal activated sludge collected from a field scale sbr treating domestic wastewater was used as the biomass source for developing anoxic ammonia removal process in a lab scale sbr source of biomass used as seed was selected based on the best performance obtained in the screening studies biomass drawn 100 ml from sbr with known mlss 3 58 g l and 420 ml of mineral media

closing with rubber cork glass tube connected with pvc pipe was drilled into the rubber cork and other end of the pipe was immersed in water seal of 50 mm depth to release gas produced in the reactor the sbr was maintained at room temperature of 30 2 c on orbital shaker scigenics biotech india at 120 2 rpm total of 148 cycles in 5 phases of sbr operation were carried out for the first 66 cycles of operation cycle time of 48 h was maintained subsequent cycles were operated at 24 h the time for filling settling and decanting was 1 h the concentrations of feed nh4 n were increased gradually from

external carbon source was added in phase v alone 96 mg l of cod as sucrose was added to aid the effective denitrification the initial ph of nutrient media was 7 3 0 3 and the sbr operation in all the phases was carried out at room temperature 30 2 c samples were withdrawn from the reactor after each cycle and analyzed for ph chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n mlss was analyzed periodically all the other operating parameters were maintained constant the medium was kept anoxic by purging with pure n2 gas for 7 min before starting the reactor and the orp was found to be 120 25 mv 2 3 3 effect of medium ph and temperature the ph and temperature of nutrient media are critical parameters that determine the survival growth and activity of microorganisms batch studies were conducted to analyze the effect of ph and temperature on nh4 n removal in the developed process biomass enriched for 96 days was added to 10 serum bottles 1 6 g l mlss each containing each 1 g of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides then nutrient media was purged with nitrogen gas and ph was adjusted to 4 5 6 7 and 8 using 1 n hcl naoh was added to the respective glass serum bottles and tightly closed the initial concentration of nh4 n was 100 mg l in all the serum bottles the incubation was done in anoxic condition using orbital shaker at room temperature similarly the batch studies for temperature optimization were conducted in the range of reaction temperatures 15 40 c using temperature controlled orbital shaking incubator remi instruments india the biomass enriched for 110 days with initial mlss of 1 8 g l was used the samples were drawn after every cycle 2 d and analyzed for ph nh4 n no2 n no3 n and cod all the batch studies were conducted in a minimum of 8 cycles and the average data is reported 2 4 inhibition studies for nh4 n no2 n and s2 high concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and s2 are toxic to ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the effect of varying concentrations of these inhibitory agents on nh4 n removal was studied in serum bottles with a capacity of 120 ml each serum bottle contained 1 g of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides known amount of enriched biomass and 95 ml of mineral media with nh4 n and respective inhibitory agents eight cycles were operated with 1 d cycle time and analysis for nh4 n no2 n no3 n ph orp mlss and cod were carried out after every cycle in addition studies were conducted to evaluate the potential for the reversibility of inhibition using the same set of reactors containing the biomass previously exposed to inhibitory agents all the reactors were made devoid of the respective inhibitory agents and were initially run for 10 days by adding the fresh mineral media in each cycle 1 d after a recovery period of 10 days mlss and nh4 n were analyzed the start up conditions of inhibitory and reversible inhibitory assays are shown in table 3 2 5 analytical techniques analyses of orp ph cod and mlss were performed as per the apha

evolution 300 and used for further mlss determination nitrogen species nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were analysed by ion chromatography basic ic plus 883 metrohm connected with cationic metrosep c4 150 4 0 and anionic metrosep a supp5 250 4 0 columns 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides fig 1 shows the xps spectrum of synthesized nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides the xps spectrum confirms the presence of fe o and c detailed scan of all the elements present were performed for the better understanding of chemical composition of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides fe 2 p peak fig 1 b of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides exhibits the presence of fe 2 p1 2 peak at 725 4 ev and fe 2 p3 2 peak at 712 38 ev these two major peaks of fe 2p and shake up satellites around 717 ev and 733 ev in fe 2p core level spectrum are characteristics of fe iii in feooh oxygen peak centered at 531 6 ev can be attributed to o 1s in feooh the o 1s region fig 1 c contains three components at 529 0 ev 531 6 ev and 533 5 ev assigned to feofe feoh and hoh bonds in the feooh structure 37 respectively the c 1s peak at 284 16 ev is assigned to cc peak of chitosan the data confirms that the synthesized nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides are feooh tga spectrum of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides is given in fig 2 a two stages of degradation are observed in the temperature ranges 50 c 200 c and 250 c 450 c the initial weight loss at 90 c could be due to the desorption of physically absorbed water the second stage of degradation around 300 c could be due to the volatilization of organic compounds of chitosan and or dehydroxylation of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides 38 the total weight loss was about 37 7 the results signify that nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides have good thermal stability within the temperature ranges of sbr operation which normally below 40 c the size distribution profile by intensity of synthesized nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides is given in fig 2 b the dls graph shows the average size of synthesized feooh as 30 4 nm 3 2 batch experiments 3 2 1 screening of biomass for anoxic nh4 n removal seed sludge for screening of biomass was collected from varied ecosystems to check for the feasibility of fe reducing ability municipal and domestic wastewaters generally contain small amounts of metals most significantly fe with concentrations of about 0 4 1 5 mg l 39 the microbes in domestic wastewater treatment plants are also exposed to higher concentrations of nh4 and cod on the other hand the said process was predominantly reported to occur in aquatic environments and soil sediments lakes and soil sediments naturally contain carbon and nutrient concentrations along with iron rich minerals diverse microbial communities present in these ecosystems are adapted to fe cod and nh4 concentrations and comprise of fe reducers and fe oxidizers which use fe iii fe ii as electron acceptor donor respectively hence selecting the seed sludge from these kind of ecosystems helps in accelerating the start up process results table 2 indicate that all the sludges were capable of removing nh4 n in the presence of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides however the optimum removal of 52 5 8 6 was obtained in the r1 reactor inoculated with activated sludge flocs procured from sbr of vit university followed by 36 1 13 in the r2 reactor with anaerobic sludge collected from nesampakkam stp the average nh4 n removal in r3 and r4 reactors were 20 6 and 25 3 respectively relatively better performance in r1 and r2 reactors might be due to the presence of biomass that was previously acclimatized to higher concentrations of nh4 n 50 100 mg l compared to the sludge procured from soil and lake sediments 10 30 mg l also the domestic and municipal sewage contains small amounts of all heavy metals including fe so the seed biomass is previously acclimated to both fe and nh4 n in short sludge collected from diverse ecosystems can act as a potential seed sludge for anoxic ammonia removal however activated sludge appears to be more efficient with very less start up period 3 2 2 sbr studies for anoxic nh4 n removal from the sbr studies fig 3 it is evident that bio catalysed anoxic ammonia removal is feasible in the presence of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides the anoxic nitrification of nh4 n here is coupled with the reduction of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides this process is comparable to the n2 cycle that occurs in fe rich marine sediments in natural environment 9 10 the anoxic oxidation of nh4 n by nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides and subsequent denitrification can occur via two pathways 1 6 f e i i i n h 4 2 h 2 o 6 f e i i n o 2 8 h Œ¥ g 87 87 k j m o l 1 2 6 f e i i 2 n o 2 8 h 6 f e i i i n 2 4 h 2 o Œ¥ g 428 62 k j m o l 1 in eq 1 anoxic nitrification is coupled to fe iii reduction where nh4 is oxidized to no2 which can then be subsequently denitrified to form n2 in eq 2 de nitrification is coupled to fe ii re oxidation where no2 is reduced to n2 these reactions allow anoxic nh4 removal to n2 and recycle of fe ii to fe iii in the reactor and thereby gives enormous possibility of economic removal of nh4 without the need of aeration and alkalinity direct oxidation of nh4 to n2 gas is also reported to occur 31 effective nitrification and denitrification was observed in phase i with not much accumulation of no2 no3 even in the absence of external addition of organic carbon this could be due to the lysis of unacclimated biomass which in turn releases organic matter into the reactor which helps in denitrification the denitrification might also have happened due to the effective re oxidation of fe ii as per reaction in eq 2 a gradual increase in nh4 n removal was observed up to phase iv this could be due to the adapted microbes and increased substrate concentration but a decrease in tn removal was observed in phase iii and phase iv which could be due to the unavailability of organic matter hence in phase v external cod was added after which effective nitrification and denitrification occurred the optimum nh4 n and tn removals of 73 1 17 4 mg l d and 68 2 16 9 mg l d respectively were obtained in phase v in the presence of nh4 n and cod mass balance of nitrogen in the reactor was calculated using the data obtained from the cycles of stable operation cycles 145 148 in phase v the average input n to the reactor was 113 22 mg n 110 mg of nh4 n 1 76 mg of no2 n 1 46 mg no3 n and the corresponding average total mass of n accumulated in the reactor at the end of cycles was 66 23 mg n 62 04 mg of nh4 n 2 22 mg of no2 n 1 96 mg no3 n so the total mass of n removed from the reactor was 46 99 mg n based on the mass balance eq considered given in the bracket without accounting the n used in the biomass synthesis total mass of input n in the reactor total mass of n accumulated in the reactor total mass of n removed from the reactor over a period of operation there was not much growth of biomass in the reactor therefore the assumption of neglecting n in biomass synthesis also valid the nitrogen removal could have occurred through several possible reactions like i fe iii mediated oxidation of nh4 n to directly give n2 ii fe iii mediated nh4 n oxidation to no2 n no3 n followed by conventional denitrification iii fe iii mediated nh4 n oxidation to no2 n no3 n followed by fe ii mediated denitrification to give n2 and iv feammox followed by denitrification without performing the tracer studies it is not possible to pin point the exact reaction responsible in tn removal high degree of ph fluctuations were never noticed in the reactor and the final ph after the reaction was always in neutral range 7 2 0 5 hence the n2 loss due to precipitation and volatilization is neglected in mass balance calculations the near neutral ph throughout the study indicates the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification though the reactor provides a conducive environment for the anammox reaction to occur here the involvement of anammox can be ruled out or it may be very negligible as the growth of anammox requires a very long period also the microbial characterization of nitrogen removal species showed only the presence of amo gene responsible for nitrification and nirk nirs and nosz genes responsible for denitrification the genes responsible for anammox were not identified however during the long term operation of the process the involvement of anammox process in nitrogen removal could also be a possibility and thus improves the tn removal in the other anoxic batch experiments results not shown the autoclaved control reactors with just nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides removed 20 of nh4 n during first 3 cycles of operation which was due to adsorption and in subsequent cycles no removal was noticed the biotic controls with biomass and without nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides showed negligible amount of nh4 n removal 2 which might be through conventional nitrification due to the traces of oxygen present considering all these points the removal of 46 99 mg n based on mass balance equation from the reactor is attributed to the processes mentioned earlier the nanostructured fe oxyhydroxide granules were intact even after several cycles of operation which is due to the use of chitosan as backbone polymer to hold the fe oxyhydroxide nano particles other similar studies reported the dissolution of fe minerals after fe redox cycling which makes the process non sustainable 40 in overall the results indicate that this anoxic process can be employed in treating wastewaters containing moderate concentrations of both nh4 n and cod when cod nh4 n ratio is less than 1 3 2 3 effect of ph and temperature results signify that the ph of growth medium influence the efficiency of nitrification nh4 n removal in different reactors ranged from 7 5 to 32 5 mg l d fig 4 a the optimum ph for nh4 n removal was at ph 7 under acidic conditions nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides have a net positive charge which causes nh4 repulsion this favors the adsorption of organic molecules with net negative charge thereby promoting the surface complexation 41 and lessening the electron acceptors availability for further nitrification whereas under alkaline conditions free ammonia nitrogen gets produced which is toxic to biomass final ph was increased in all the reactors which is due to the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification denitrification at ph 4 nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides were not stable they lost its granular structure and turned into a fine powder fe iii primarily exists as solid phase minerals at circumneutral ph while it was known to be more soluble at lower ph range 42 several prokaryotes can perform dissimilatory fe reduction with fe iii as the sole electron acceptor at a broad ph range 3 hence the favourable results obtained at near neutral ph is due to the combined action of abiotic and biotic factors studies conducted at varied temperatures show that ammonia removal was optimum in the range of 25 30 c and the system could work even in the range of 20 40 c fig 4 b the optimal temperatures for various neutrophiles for microbial fe redox cycling is reported in the range of 20 35 c 43 previous studies related to ammonium removal in fe oxide environments reported the consortium of aob denitrifiers nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and anammox temperature plays a major role on activity of all these bacteria it is well established that ammonia oxidation to nitrite is higher at temperatures greater than 25 c as aob grow faster at these temperatures compared to nob 10 20 c 44 the corresponding no3 n accumulations at temperatures in ¬∫c 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 were mg l 8 7 0 42 19 4 0 56 9 12 0 4 9 16 0 49 8 32 1 87 and 7 7 0 99 respectively which indicate the increased activity of nob at 20 c the growth and activity of aob and denitrifiers gets decreased at low temperatures leading to decrease in tn removal on the other hand it is interesting to note that there is no drastic decrease in nh4 n removal at higher temperatures 40 c which is because of higher chemisorption of nh4 n by nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides at increasing temperatures however this is not beneficial in subsequent cycles as the redox cycling gets effected due to chemisorption the microbial fe reducing capacity was reported to decrease at high temperatures 35 c as the enzyme iron reductase gets inhibited 21 hence the synergistic effect of microbial community and nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides makes this process optimum at 25 30 c 3 3 inhibition studies using nh4 n no2 n and s2 3 3 1 nh4 n decrease in nh4 n removal efficiency with increase in nh4 n concentration was observed fig 5 a the optimum removal was at 500 mg l of nh4 n concentration nh4 n is a growth nutrient and concentrations below 200 mg l are beneficial in anaerobic processes while higher concentrations of nh4 n present in wastewaters are inhibitory to various microbial species but as the biomass was initially acclimatized to 500 mg l of nh4 n decrease in the efficiency was not noticed in the reactor with 500 mg l of nh4 n in fact the performance of reactor with 500 mg l was better than that of 100 mg l which could be due to increased substrate concentration free ammonia nitrogen which is ph dependent is cytotoxic to microbes as it easily permeate through the cell membranes and cause proton imbalance 45 free ammonia nitrogen will be more in the alkaline ph decreased performance was noticed in the reactors that were added with nh4 n 1000 mg l when nh4 n concentration increases the ph of the media increases and releases more free ammonia nitrogen which inhibits the microbial activity initial mlss in all the reactors was 1 69 g l increase in the mlss was observed fig 5 a in the reactors with nh4 n concentrations till 1500 mg l whereas higher concentrations of nh4 n 1500 mg l is inhibitory to biomass as explained earlier which can be confirmed by the decrease in mlss in the respective reactors the decrease of mlss occurs by the lyses of inhibited biomass the results of reversible inhibitory studies are given in fig 5 b after 10 days of recovery period the reactors with concentrations till 1000 mg l regained their efficiency of nh4 n removal and microbial growth in the other reactors with higher concentrations an increase in mlss is seen but nh4 n removal efficiency has not increased except a3 indicating the necessity of more recovery time domestic wastewaters contain a maximum of 100 mg l of nh4 n whereas some industrial effluents contain up to 700 mg l of nh4 n this process can resist the influent of nh4 n till 1000 mg l and has the potential for sustainable nh4 n removal in practical application 3 3 2 no2 n n nitrite is an intermediate produced during nh4 oxidation and no3 reduction at higher ph and increased nh4 n levels denitrification slows down leading to accumulation of nitrite in the system nitrite under higher concentrations acts as an inhibiting agent causing temporary or permanant toxicity to certain species of microbes 46 in the reactors added with no2 n concentrations of 0 200 mg l nh4 n removal was obtained around 60 mg l d and 75 mg l d fig 6 a maximum nitrification efficiency and increase in mlss were noticed in the reactors with no2 n of 100 mg l results indicate that limited addition of no2 n enhances the reactor performance 16 7 mg l d of no2 n was used in the reactor with initial no2 n of 100 mg l this could be utilized in the reoxidation of fe ii thereby enhancing the recycling of fe oxyhydroxides also there is a likelihood of anammox reaction to take place in the presence of no2 n noticeable decrease in the reactors performance was observed when with no2 n was in the range of 300 500 mg l similar results were reported in previous studies 47 48 therefore the process can tolerate up to 200 mg l of no2 n contrastingly in the reversible inhibitory studies fig 6 b blank reactor with no added external no2 n out performed the reactor with 100 mg l of no2 n which was otherwise superior in toxicity studies in the reactors with 200 500 mg l of no2 n no improvement in nh4 n removal efficiency occurred indicating the irreversible inhibition also nh4 n removal slightly decreased in all the reactors compared to the toxicity assays which further strengthen the assumption that the presence of no2 n in small concentrations accelerates the reaction though the biotic oxidation of fe ii coupled to no2 reduction helps in the effective tn removal under elevated concentrations of no2 n abiotic chemical oxidation of fe ii is known to generate higher concentrations of n2o 49 which is highly toxic to several strains of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers 50 due to the presence of both biomass and nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides in these reactors the role of abiotic and biotic factors could not be separately determined 3 3 3 s2 sulfate is a common constituent of many industrial wastewaters in anaerobic or anoxic reactors sulfate is reduced to sulfide by the sulfate reducing bacteria soluble sulfur is necessary for the growth of microbes however s2 or dissolved h2s in higher levels are toxic to many bacterial groups 51 results indicate a decreasing trend in nh4 n removal as the initial concentrations of s2 increased fig 7 a complete inhibition was observed in the reactors with 400 and 500 mg l of s2 nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides have good adsorption affinity towards s2 for few cycles which is evident from decreased effluent s2 concentrations results not shown h2s was reported to reduce ferric iron oxides which result in the formation of iron sulfide fes pyrite fes2 and elemental sulfur this in turn affects nh4 n removal in further cycles as the surface of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides is masked by sulphides and or sulphur and thus no electron acceptors would be available for nh4 n oxidation one advantage is that under high concentrations of fe iii and s2 reactive fe iii compounds react rapidly with sulfides thereby scavenging the sulfides formed through so4 2 reduction and hence provides a protective shield for microbes from inhibition 52 negative nh4 n removal is observed in the reactor with 500 mg l of s2 this could be owed to enhanced sludge hydrolysis under high concentrations of s2 which is also apparent from the drastic decrease in mlss whiteley et al 53 reported the enhanced sludge hydrolysis under sulfidogenic environment 400 1000 mg l of s2 due to the maximized enzymatic activity of lipases in the reversible inhibitory studies fig 7 b s2 adsorbed nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides were replaced with pristine nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides results signify the possible reversible activity in the reactors exposed until 200 mg l of initial s2 in the other reactors with more than 200 mg l of s2 it seems to be an irreversible inhibition the slight nh4 n removal in the reactors with 300 500 mg l of s2 in reversible inhibitory assay is due to adsorption by pristine nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides from the results obtained 200 mg l s2 could tol√©rate in the process 4 conclusions anoxic nh4 n removal from aqueous media is feasible in the presence of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides biomass collected from diverse ecosystems can act as a potential seed sludge to develop the process however activated sludge appears to be more efficient with very less start up period a versatile microbial consortium can be enriched which is capable of performing fe iii fe ii mediated tn removal in the presence of externally added cod or by utilizing the cod produced through cell lysis effective nitrification denitrification and cod removal were observed for several cycles of operation in anoxic conditions when cod nh4 n is less than 1 with maximum nh4 n and tn removals mg l d of 73 1 17 4 and 68 2 16 9 respectively this indicates the recycling of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides in the redox environment which makes the process more sustainable the simultaneous reactions did not significantly affect the ph indeed the simultaneous nitrification denitrification helps in maintaining the ph and eliminates the need of additional alkalinity the optimum conditions for anoxic nh4 n removal were observed at ph 7 and temperature of 25 30 c a decrease in nh4 n removal efficiency of the process was observed in the presence of higher concentrations of nh4 n 1000 mg l no2 n 200 mg l and s2 200 mg l the process is cost effective as it does not require any supply of aeration and alkalinity acknowledgment this work was supported by department of science and technology dst government

14192,simultaneous nitrification and denitrification coupled to fe redox cycling was achieved by activated sludge flocs sourced from a sequential batch reactor sbr treating domestic sewage and with less efficiency using the sludge from various environments this novel process involves bio catalytic oxidation of nh4 n using nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides under anoxic environment in a sbr nh4 n oxidation is associated with biogenic fe iii reduction and simultaneous fe ii oxidation which is inturn associated with no2 n and or no3 n reduction the internal recycling of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides makes nh4 n removal to undergo multiple cycles the synthesized oxides were identified as feooh based on xps data and have an average size of 30 nm the nh4 n and total nitrogen removals obtained were 73 1 17 4 mg l d and 68 2 16 9 mg l d respectively optimum conditions for nh4 n removal were at ph of 7 and temperature of 25 30 c the inhibition effects of nh4 n no2 n and s2 on anoxic nh4 n removal and the possibility of recovery from inhibition were also studied and discussed this process does not require oxygen and alkalinity and hence is inexpensive compared to other existing techniques keywords nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides anoxic ammonia removal sequencing batch reactor nitrification denitrification inhibition 1 introduction contamination of waterbodies by nh4 n has become a significant environmental threat for example the presence of nh4 n causes depletion of dissolved oxygen eutrophication of lakes and toxicity to fishes 1 therefore nh4 n should be removed from wastewaters before discharging in to the surface waters biological processes for nh4 n removal are cheaper compared to physico chemical processes in the conventional nitrification denitrification process nh4 n gets converted into no3 n by nitrifiers using o2 and then no3 n gets transformed subsequently into n2 gas by denitrifiers however this process requires relatively high input of energy to maintain high dissolved oxygen levels for nitrification 2 and periodic failures are reported as the process is sensitive to ph temperature and toxic substances also some time external addition of chemicals are required for ph regulation and effective denitrifcation therefore development of an alternative anoxic ammonia removal process which requires less input of energy and chemical is desirable in the marine and soil sediments an alternative for nitrification and denitrification pathway is reported using redox metals acting as catalysts 3 7 studies indicating the coupling of fe and n in biogeochemical cycles under anoxic conditions have attracted increased attention of researchers several studies have reported that under anoxic conditions iron reducing bacteria play an important role in biogeochemical cycles of n2 and carbon in aquatic ecosystems 8 anoxic oxidation of nh4 n mediated by microbes and metal oxides occurs through a well established sequence of primary redox reactions and they produce reduced metal by products these reduced species sequentially take part in a variety of secondary reactions for instance in the presence of fe oxides hydroxides nh4 n gets oxidized to no2 n no3 n or n2 and gives fe ii as a by product this fe ii will inturn reduce no2 n and no3 n to n2 and produces fe iii 9 10 this series of reactions will lead to simultaneous nitrification denitrification and recycling of fe oxides hydroxides microbes make use of fe iii as external electron acceptor in metabolism under anoxic conditions and thereby reducing fe iii to fe ii easily microbes performing this dissimilatory fe iii reduction obtains energy for growth iron oxidizing bacteria are reported to mediate the fe ii oxidation to fe iii using no2 n or no3 n as electron acceptors in the last two decades substantial research was undertaken towards understanding the biogeochemical mechanisms that facilitate anoxic fe iii dependent ammonium oxidation in environment the discovery of this interesting phenomena dates back to 1990 s when excess unaccounted dinitrogen was detected under anoxic conditions in marine waters in the absence of oxidized nitrogen species that are required for denitrification and anammox thermodynamic calculations pointed toward this new pathway involving metals and metal oxides of environmental abundance as electron acceptors 11 12 the initial studies were limited to batch incubations using the sediments collected from marine ecosystems simultaneous organic oxidation and dissimilatory fe iii reduction coupled with microbial growth in the presence of acetate was first reported by lovley and phillips 13 by conducting anaerobic batch experiments using marine sediments in the form of amorphous fe oxides and fe oxyhydroxides cl√©ment et al 5 performed anaerobic batch experiments using riparian forest soils and amended urea as nitrogen source they observed fe ii and temporary no2 spikes that quickly transformed in to gaseous n2 without formation of no3 leading to total nitrogen removal which led to the confirmation that fe iii reduction was coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation to no2 similarly in another study sawayama 14 reported the nh4 oxidation and no2 generation in the presence of fe iii edtana mediated by iron reducing bacteria of genus exiguobacterium in an anoxic fixed bed reactor containing anaerobically digested sludge collected from a cattle waste treatment plant and this process was termed as feammox park et al 15 related the increased nitrite and nitrate levels in an anaerobic batch reactor with piggery wastewater culture fe iii citrate and ammonium to feammox and the resultant anammox process enhanced in the presence of bicarbonate leading to oxidation of 0 33 mol nh4 mol fe iii reduced indeed the tracer studies conducted by yang et al 16 in tropical upland soil slurries incubated with ammonium and exogenous fe iii proved the role of feammox process in the significant loss of nitrogen owing to nitrogen removal of 1 20 0 28 mg n g d this feammox process was also reported to occur in highly cultivated paddy soils as they are rich in iron oxides batch incubations by ding et al 17 shown the occurrence of feammox related no2 or no3 production followed by anammox or denitrification leading to removal of 0 17 to 0 59 mg n kg d and this reaction can still be enhanced by the addition of electron shuttles like 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds or biochar 18 19 through batch and continuous flow membrane reactor experiments using forest riparian wetland sediments huang and jaffe 20 confirmed the occurrence of nh4 oxidation coupled to fe iii reduction followed by denitrification and or anammox to give n2 by acidimicrobiaceae bacterium similarly batch experiments using sediments collected from oligotrophic reservoir shown simultaneous anaerobic fe iii reduction and nh4 oxidation in the presence of carbon source glucose mediated by klebsiella sp fc61 21 fe oxides were also reported to be involved in no2 no3 dependent fe ii oxidation this process was first demonstrated in enrichment cultures amended with fe ii from marine sediments and no3 22 this process was since been reported to occur in various freshwater and marine water environments and the species involved in this process are mostly mixotrophs that require an organic carbon source 23 this process gives n2 and fe iii as end products 24 though this reaction is mostly mediated by microbes abiotic reduction of nitrite to n2 coupled with fe ii oxidation was reported in few studies 25 for the process to be sustainable internal redox cycling of fe is essential most recent studies demonstrated the possibility of internal dynamic redox cycling of fe ii fe iii coupled to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification mejia et al 26 successfully achieved fe redox cycling in batch experiments with soil samples by creating alternating fe reducing and fe oxidizing environments using lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite and found that these processes were mediated by geobacter and dechloromonas respectively similarly lu et al 27 reported a heterogeneous fe redox cycling involving diverse processes like biotic conversion of fe ii to no2 by shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and abiotic denitrification to give n2 gas leading to multiple fe ii fe iii cycles several anaerobic batch reactor studies demonstrated the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification coupled to fe oxides forming a fe ii fe iii redox cycle in the presence of various fe iii forms like magnetite ferrihydrite fe2o3 fe oh 3 mediated by fe reducing bacteria like geobacter pseudomonas desulfosporosinus dechloromonas and desulfomicrobium fe oxidizing bacteria like acidovorax and comamonadaceae anammox species like candidatus kuenenia candidatus scalindua candidatus brocadia candidatus brocadia and denitrifiers like acinetobacter rhodoplanes bacillus and pseudomonas 19 28 30 the above mentioned studies focussed on the occurrence of the process in natural environments in the presence of bulk fe oxides but not much work involving removal of nh4 n from wastewaters by nanoscale oxides of fe in engineered reactors was reported except the first work by the authors 31 in the reported study 31 an environmental friendly chemical approach was engaged to produce nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides embedded on chitosan nanosized metal oxides exhibit high surface area high reactivity and high affinity towards many pollutants 32 33 chitosan acts as a biopolymer support and gives nanostructures with improved properties like stability biocompatibility biodegradability and also reduces the toxicity 34 recently the dissimilatory fe iii reduction has been receiving increased attention due to its application in water and wastewater treatment 35 in this context this work reports the extension of the reported process 31 such as screening of biomass from various environmental compartments for anoxic ammonia removal and demonstration of the process in a sbr operation though this process is established by previous work the information on selection of seed biomass for start up the effects of major environmental parameters like ph and temperature of incoming wastewaters and the effect of inhibitory concentrations of certain compounds on the said process is not available accordingly all these parameters provide a rationale for scaling up the process as fluctuations of these parameters in influent wastewaters and or inside the reactor significantly affect the process hence the current study aims to establish the optimal degree of this new process by investigating the selection of seed biomass effect of ph temperature and inhibitory effects of nh4 n no2 n and s2 these aspects are studied and discussed which is significant in the propagation of this new process for engineering applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and mineral media fecl3 6h2o naoh

local perennial lake all the sludge from diverse background were collected stored in anoxic conditions transferred to the laboratory and were used immediately garden soil and lake sediments were processed by removing undesirable materials like pebbles roots etc then they were well mixed to suspend the microbes from the soil into the broth and allowed to settle for few minutes until most of the soil particles have settled the upper liquid broth was then used as inocula all the four batch reactors were seeded with nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides 1 g well mixed and prewashed sludge from the respective sources 30 ml and mineral media containing nh4 n to have an inital average concentration of 100 mg l in serum bottle serum bottles were purged with n2 for three minutes and sealed tightly with aluminum crimp caps the reactors were operated at room temperature 30 2 c on an orbital shaker scigenics biotech india at 120 2 rpm the initial ph was 7 6 0 3 the reactors were operated for 15 cycles cycle time 2 d the batch reactors were covered with black sheets to prevent any possible photosynthetic activity after each cycle the reactors were allowed for 30 min of settling the used media was decanted and a fresh n2 purged mineral media was added nh4 n was measured at the end of each cycle the studies were done in duplicates and the average value is reported 2 3 2 sbr studies for anoxic nh4 n removal activated sludge collected from a field scale sbr treating domestic wastewater was used as the biomass source for developing anoxic ammonia removal process in a lab scale sbr source of biomass used as seed was selected based on the best performance obtained in the screening studies biomass drawn 100 ml from sbr with known mlss 3 58 g l and 420 ml of mineral media containing predetermined concentrations of nh4 n was taken in a 500 ml reagent bottle to this 10 g of synthesized nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides was added the reactor was kept anoxic by tightly closing with rubber cork glass tube connected with pvc pipe was drilled into the rubber cork and other end of the pipe was immersed in water seal of 50 mm depth to release gas produced in the reactor the sbr was maintained at room temperature of 30 2 c on orbital shaker scigenics biotech india at 120 2 rpm total of 148 cycles in 5 phases of sbr operation were carried out for the first 66 cycles of operation cycle time of 48 h was maintained subsequent cycles were operated at 24 h the time for filling settling and decanting was 1 h the concentrations of feed nh4 n were increased gradually from 100 mg l to 200 mg l 1 47 cycles phase i 100 mg l 48 66 cycles phase ii 125 mg l 67 77 cycles phase iii 150 mg l 78 111 cycles phase iv 200 mg l 112 148 cycles phase v 200 mg l in phases i to iv no external carbon source was added in phase v alone 96 mg l of cod as sucrose was added to aid the effective denitrification the initial ph of nutrient media was 7 3 0 3 and the sbr operation in all the phases was carried out at room temperature 30 2 c samples were withdrawn from the reactor after each cycle and analyzed for ph chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no3 n and no2 n mlss was analyzed periodically all the other operating parameters were maintained constant the medium was kept anoxic by purging with pure n2 gas for 7 min before starting the reactor and the orp was found to be 120 25 mv 2 3 3 effect of medium ph and temperature the ph and temperature of nutrient media are critical parameters that determine the survival growth and activity of microorganisms batch studies were conducted to analyze the effect of ph and temperature on nh4 n removal in the developed process biomass enriched for 96 days was added to 10 serum bottles 1 6 g l mlss each containing each 1 g of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides then nutrient media was purged with nitrogen gas and ph was adjusted to 4 5 6 7 and 8 using 1 n hcl naoh was added to the respective glass serum bottles and tightly closed the initial concentration of nh4 n was 100 mg l in all the serum bottles the incubation was done in anoxic condition using orbital shaker at room temperature similarly the batch studies for temperature optimization were conducted in the range of reaction temperatures 15 40 c using temperature controlled orbital shaking incubator remi instruments india the biomass enriched for 110 days with initial mlss of 1 8 g l was used the samples were drawn after every cycle 2 d and analyzed for ph nh4 n no2 n no3 n and cod all the batch studies were conducted in a minimum of 8 cycles and the average data is reported 2 4 inhibition studies for nh4 n no2 n and s2 high concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and s2 are toxic to ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the effect of varying concentrations of these inhibitory agents on nh4 n removal was studied in serum bottles with a capacity of 120 ml each serum bottle contained 1 g of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides known amount of enriched biomass and 95 ml of mineral media with nh4 n and respective inhibitory agents eight cycles were operated with 1 d cycle time and analysis for nh4 n no2 n no3 n ph orp mlss and cod were carried out after every cycle in addition studies were conducted to evaluate the potential for the reversibility of inhibition using the same set of reactors containing the biomass previously exposed to inhibitory agents all the reactors were made devoid of the respective inhibitory agents and were initially run for 10 days by adding the fresh mineral media in each cycle 1 d after a recovery period of 10 days mlss and nh4 n were analyzed the start up conditions of inhibitory and reversible inhibitory assays are shown in table 3 2 5 analytical techniques analyses of orp ph cod and mlss were performed as per the apha protocols 36 ph and orp were measured by potentiometric method using ph meter connected with orp electrode wtw inolab 720 germany cod was measured by the closed reflux method using wtw cr 3200 germany

evolution 300 and used for further mlss determination nitrogen species nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were analysed by ion chromatography basic ic plus 883 metrohm connected with cationic metrosep c4 150 4 0 and anionic metrosep a supp5 250 4 0 columns 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides fig 1 shows the xps spectrum of synthesized nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides the xps spectrum confirms the presence of fe o and c detailed scan of all the elements present were performed for the better understanding of chemical composition of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides fe 2 p peak fig 1 b of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides exhibits the presence of fe 2 p1 2 peak at 725 4 ev and fe 2 p3 2 peak at 712 38 ev these two major peaks of fe 2p and shake up satellites around 717 ev and 733 ev in fe 2p core level spectrum are characteristics of fe iii in feooh oxygen peak centered at 531 6 ev can be attributed to o 1s in feooh the o 1s region fig 1 c contains three components at 529 0 ev 531 6 ev and 533 5 ev assigned to feofe feoh and hoh bonds in the feooh structure 37 respectively the c 1s peak at 284 16 ev is assigned to cc peak of chitosan the data confirms that the synthesized nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides are feooh tga spectrum of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides is given in fig 2 a two stages of degradation are observed in the temperature ranges 50 c 200 c and 250 c 450 c the initial weight loss at 90 c could be due to the desorption of physically absorbed water the second stage of degradation around 300 c could be due to the volatilization of organic compounds of chitosan and or dehydroxylation of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides 38 the total weight loss was about 37 7 the results signify that nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides have good thermal stability within the temperature ranges of sbr operation which normally below 40 c the size distribution profile by intensity of synthesized nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides is given in fig 2 b the dls graph shows the average size of synthesized feooh as 30 4 nm 3 2 batch experiments 3 2 1 screening of biomass for anoxic nh4 n removal seed sludge for screening of biomass was collected from varied ecosystems to check for the feasibility of fe reducing ability municipal and domestic wastewaters generally contain small amounts of metals most significantly fe with concentrations of about 0 4 1 5 mg l 39 the microbes in domestic wastewater treatment plants are also exposed to higher concentrations of nh4 and cod on the other hand the said process was predominantly reported to occur in aquatic environments and soil sediments lakes and soil sediments naturally contain carbon and nutrient concentrations along with iron rich minerals diverse microbial communities present in these ecosystems are adapted to fe cod and nh4 concentrations and comprise of fe reducers and fe oxidizers which use fe iii fe ii as electron acceptor donor respectively hence selecting the seed sludge from these kind of ecosystems helps in accelerating the start up process results table 2 indicate that all the sludges were capable of removing nh4 n in the presence of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides however the optimum removal of 52 5 8 6 was obtained in the r1 reactor inoculated with activated sludge flocs procured from sbr of vit university followed by 36 1 13 in the r2 reactor with anaerobic sludge collected from nesampakkam stp the average nh4 n removal in r3 and r4 reactors were 20 6 and 25 3 respectively relatively better performance in r1 and r2 reactors might be due to the presence of biomass that was previously acclimatized to higher concentrations of nh4 n 50 100 mg l compared to the sludge procured from soil and lake sediments 10 30 mg l also the domestic and municipal sewage contains small amounts of all heavy metals including fe so the seed biomass is previously acclimated to both fe and nh4 n in short sludge collected from diverse ecosystems can act as a potential seed sludge for anoxic ammonia removal however activated sludge appears to be more efficient with very less start up period 3 2 2 sbr studies for anoxic nh4 n removal from the sbr studies fig 3 it is evident that bio catalysed anoxic ammonia removal is feasible in the presence of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides the anoxic nitrification of nh4 n here is coupled with the reduction of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides this process is comparable to the n2 cycle that occurs in fe rich marine sediments in natural environment 9 10 the anoxic oxidation of nh4 n by nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides and subsequent denitrification can occur via two pathways 1 6 f e i i i n h 4 2 h 2 o 6 f e i i n o 2 8 h Œ¥ g 87 87 k j m o l 1 2 6 f e i i 2 n o 2 8 h 6 f e i i i n 2 4 h 2 o Œ¥ g 428 62 k j m o l 1 in eq 1 anoxic nitrification is coupled to fe iii reduction where nh4 is oxidized to no2 which can then be subsequently denitrified to form n2 in eq 2 de nitrification is coupled to fe ii re oxidation where no2 is reduced to n2 these reactions allow anoxic nh4 removal to n2 and recycle of fe ii to fe iii in the reactor and thereby gives enormous possibility of economic removal of nh4 without the need of aeration and alkalinity direct oxidation of nh4 to n2 gas is also reported to occur 31 effective nitrification and denitrification was observed in phase i with not much accumulation of no2 no3 even in the absence of external addition of organic carbon this could be due to the lysis of unacclimated biomass which in turn releases organic matter into the reactor which helps in denitrification the denitrification might also have happened due to the effective re oxidation of fe ii as per reaction in eq 2 a gradual increase in nh4 n removal was observed up to phase iv this could be due to the adapted microbes and increased substrate concentration but a decrease in tn removal was observed in phase iii and phase iv which could be due to the unavailability of organic matter hence in phase v external cod was added after which effective nitrification and denitrification occurred the optimum nh4 n and tn removals of 73 1 17 4 mg l d and 68 2 16 9 mg l d respectively were obtained in phase v in the presence of nh4 n and cod mass balance of nitrogen in the reactor was calculated using the data obtained from the cycles of stable operation cycles 145 148 in phase v the average input n to the reactor was 113 22 mg n 110 mg of nh4 n 1 76 mg of no2 n 1 46 mg no3 n and the corresponding average total mass of n accumulated in the reactor at the end of cycles was 66 23 mg n 62 04 mg of nh4 n 2 22 mg of no2 n 1 96 mg no3 n so the total mass of n removed from the reactor was 46 99 mg n based on the mass balance eq considered given in the bracket without accounting the n used in the biomass synthesis total mass of input n in the reactor total mass of n accumulated in the reactor total mass of n removed from the reactor over a period of operation there was not much growth of biomass in the reactor therefore the assumption of neglecting n in biomass synthesis also valid the nitrogen removal could have occurred through several possible reactions like i fe iii mediated oxidation of nh4 n to directly give n2 ii fe iii mediated nh4 n oxidation to no2 n no3 n followed by conventional denitrification iii fe iii mediated nh4 n oxidation to no2 n no3 n followed by fe ii mediated denitrification to give n2 and iv feammox followed by denitrification without performing the tracer studies it is not possible to pin point the exact reaction responsible in tn removal high degree of ph fluctuations were never noticed in the reactor and the final ph after the reaction was always in neutral range 7 2 0 5 hence the n2 loss due to precipitation and volatilization is neglected in mass balance calculations the near neutral ph throughout the study indicates the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification though the reactor provides a conducive environment for the anammox reaction to occur here the involvement of anammox can be ruled out or it may be very negligible as the growth of anammox requires a very long period also the microbial characterization of nitrogen removal species showed only the presence of amo gene responsible for nitrification and nirk nirs and nosz genes responsible for denitrification the genes responsible for anammox were not identified however during the long term operation of the process the involvement of anammox process in nitrogen removal could also be a possibility and thus improves the tn removal in the other anoxic batch experiments results not shown the autoclaved control reactors with just nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides removed 20 of nh4 n during first 3 cycles of operation which was due to adsorption and in subsequent cycles no removal was noticed the biotic controls with biomass and without nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides showed negligible amount of nh4 n removal 2 which might be through conventional nitrification due to the traces of oxygen present considering all these points the removal of 46 99 mg n based on mass balance equation from the reactor is attributed to the processes mentioned earlier the nanostructured fe oxyhydroxide granules were intact even after several cycles of operation which is due to the use of chitosan as backbone polymer to hold the fe oxyhydroxide nano particles other similar studies reported the dissolution of fe minerals after fe redox cycling which makes the process non sustainable 40 in overall the results indicate that this anoxic process can be employed in treating wastewaters containing moderate concentrations of both nh4 n and cod when cod nh4 n ratio is less than 1 3 2 3 effect of ph and temperature results signify that the ph of growth medium influence the efficiency of nitrification nh4 n removal in different reactors ranged from 7 5 to 32 5 mg l d fig 4 a the optimum ph for nh4 n removal was at ph 7 under acidic conditions nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides have a net positive charge which causes nh4 repulsion this favors the adsorption of organic molecules with net negative charge thereby promoting the surface complexation 41 and lessening the electron acceptors availability for further nitrification whereas under alkaline conditions free ammonia nitrogen gets produced which is toxic to biomass final ph was increased in all the reactors which is due to the occurrence of simultaneous nitrification denitrification at ph 4 nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides were not stable they lost its granular structure and turned into a fine powder fe iii primarily exists as solid phase minerals at circumneutral ph while it was known to be more soluble at lower ph range 42 several prokaryotes can perform dissimilatory fe reduction with fe iii as the sole electron acceptor at a broad ph range 3 hence the favourable results obtained at near neutral ph is due to the combined action of abiotic and biotic factors studies conducted at varied temperatures show that ammonia removal was optimum in the range of 25 30 c and the system could work even in the range of 20 40 c fig 4 b the optimal temperatures for various neutrophiles for microbial fe redox cycling is reported in the range of 20 35 c 43 previous studies related to ammonium removal in fe oxide environments reported the consortium of aob denitrifiers nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and anammox temperature plays a major role on activity of all these bacteria it is well established that ammonia oxidation to nitrite is higher at temperatures greater than 25 c as aob grow faster at these temperatures compared to nob 10 20 c 44 the corresponding no3 n accumulations at temperatures in ¬∫c 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 were mg l 8 7 0 42 19 4 0 56 9 12 0 4 9 16 0 49 8 32 1 87 and 7 7 0 99 respectively which indicate the increased activity of nob at 20 c the growth and activity of aob and denitrifiers gets decreased at low temperatures leading to decrease in tn removal on the other hand it is interesting to note that there is no drastic decrease in nh4 n removal at higher temperatures 40 c which is because of higher chemisorption of nh4 n by nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides at increasing temperatures however this is not beneficial in subsequent cycles as the redox cycling gets effected due to chemisorption the microbial fe reducing capacity was reported to decrease at high temperatures 35 c as the enzyme iron reductase gets inhibited 21 hence the synergistic effect of microbial community and nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides makes this process optimum at 25 30 c 3 3 inhibition studies using nh4 n no2 n and s2 3 3 1 nh4 n decrease in nh4 n removal efficiency with increase in nh4 n concentration was observed fig 5 a the optimum removal was at 500 mg l of nh4 n concentration nh4 n is a growth nutrient and concentrations below 200 mg l are beneficial in anaerobic processes while higher concentrations of nh4 n present in wastewaters are inhibitory to various microbial species but as the biomass was initially acclimatized to 500 mg l of nh4 n decrease in the efficiency was not noticed in the reactor with 500 mg l of nh4 n in fact the performance of reactor with 500 mg l was better than that of 100 mg l which could be due to increased substrate concentration free ammonia nitrogen which is ph dependent is cytotoxic to microbes as it easily permeate through the cell membranes and cause proton imbalance 45 free ammonia nitrogen will be more in the alkaline ph decreased performance was noticed in the reactors that were added with nh4 n 1000 mg l when nh4 n concentration increases the ph of the media increases and releases more free ammonia nitrogen which inhibits the microbial activity initial mlss in all the reactors was 1 69 g l increase in the mlss was observed fig 5 a in the reactors with nh4 n concentrations till 1500 mg l whereas higher concentrations of nh4 n 1500 mg l is inhibitory to biomass as explained earlier which can be confirmed by the decrease in mlss in the respective reactors the decrease of mlss occurs by the lyses of inhibited biomass the results of reversible inhibitory studies are given in fig 5 b after 10 days of recovery period the reactors with concentrations till 1000 mg l regained their efficiency of nh4 n removal and microbial growth in the other reactors with higher concentrations an increase in mlss is seen but nh4 n removal efficiency has not increased except a3 indicating the necessity of more recovery time domestic wastewaters contain a maximum of 100 mg l of nh4 n whereas some industrial effluents contain up to 700 mg l of nh4 n this process can resist the influent of nh4 n till 1000 mg l and has the potential for sustainable nh4 n removal in practical application 3 3 2 no2 n n nitrite is an intermediate produced during nh4 oxidation and no3 reduction at higher ph and increased nh4 n levels denitrification slows down leading to accumulation of nitrite in the system nitrite under higher concentrations acts as an inhibiting agent causing temporary or permanant toxicity to certain species of microbes 46 in the reactors added with no2 n concentrations of 0 200 mg l nh4 n removal was obtained around 60 mg l d and 75 mg l d fig 6 a maximum nitrification efficiency and increase in mlss were noticed in the reactors with no2 n of 100 mg l results indicate that limited addition of no2 n enhances the reactor performance 16 7 mg l d of no2 n was used in the reactor with initial no2 n of 100 mg l this could be utilized in the reoxidation of fe ii thereby enhancing the recycling of fe oxyhydroxides also there is a likelihood of anammox reaction to take place in the presence of no2 n noticeable decrease in the reactors performance was observed when with no2 n was in the range of 300 500 mg l similar results were reported in previous studies 47 48 therefore the process can tolerate up to 200 mg l of no2 n contrastingly in the reversible inhibitory studies fig 6 b blank reactor with no added external no2 n out performed the reactor with 100 mg l of no2 n which was otherwise superior in toxicity studies in the reactors with 200 500 mg l of no2 n no improvement in nh4 n removal efficiency occurred indicating the irreversible inhibition also nh4 n removal slightly decreased in all the reactors compared to the toxicity assays which further strengthen the assumption that the presence of no2 n in small concentrations accelerates the reaction though the biotic oxidation of fe ii coupled to no2 reduction helps in the effective tn removal under elevated concentrations of no2 n abiotic chemical oxidation of fe ii is known to generate higher concentrations of n2o 49 which is highly toxic to several strains of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers 50 due to the presence of both biomass and nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides in these reactors the role of abiotic and biotic factors could not be separately determined 3 3 3 s2 sulfate is a common constituent of many industrial wastewaters in anaerobic or anoxic reactors sulfate is reduced to sulfide by the sulfate reducing bacteria soluble sulfur is necessary for the growth of microbes however s2 or dissolved h2s in higher levels are toxic to many bacterial groups 51 results indicate a decreasing trend in nh4 n removal as the initial concentrations of s2 increased fig 7 a complete inhibition was observed in the reactors with 400 and 500 mg l of s2 nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides have good adsorption affinity towards s2 for few cycles which is evident from decreased effluent s2 concentrations results not shown h2s was reported to reduce ferric iron oxides which result in the formation of iron sulfide fes pyrite fes2 and elemental sulfur this in turn affects nh4 n removal in further cycles as the surface of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides is masked by sulphides and or sulphur and thus no electron acceptors would be available for nh4 n oxidation one advantage is that under high concentrations of fe iii and s2 reactive fe iii compounds react rapidly with sulfides thereby scavenging the sulfides formed through so4 2 reduction and hence provides a protective shield for microbes from inhibition 52 negative nh4 n removal is observed in the reactor with 500 mg l of s2 this could be owed to enhanced sludge hydrolysis under high concentrations of s2 which is also apparent from the drastic decrease in mlss whiteley et al 53 reported the enhanced sludge hydrolysis under sulfidogenic environment 400 1000 mg l of s2 due to the maximized enzymatic activity of lipases in the reversible inhibitory studies fig 7 b s2 adsorbed nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides were replaced with pristine nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides results signify the possible reversible activity in the reactors exposed until 200 mg l of initial s2 in the other reactors with more than 200 mg l of s2 it seems to be an irreversible inhibition the slight nh4 n removal in the reactors with 300 500 mg l of s2 in reversible inhibitory assay is due to adsorption by pristine nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides from the results obtained 200 mg l s2 could tol√©rate in the process 4 conclusions anoxic nh4 n removal from aqueous media is feasible in the presence of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides biomass collected from diverse ecosystems can act as a potential seed sludge to develop the process however activated sludge appears to be more efficient with very less start up period a versatile microbial consortium can be enriched which is capable of performing fe iii fe ii mediated tn removal in the presence of externally added cod or by utilizing the cod produced through cell lysis effective nitrification denitrification and cod removal were observed for several cycles of operation in anoxic conditions when cod nh4 n is less than 1 with maximum nh4 n and tn removals mg l d of 73 1 17 4 and 68 2 16 9 respectively this indicates the recycling of nanostructured fe oxyhydroxides in the redox environment which makes the process more sustainable the simultaneous reactions did not significantly affect the ph indeed the simultaneous nitrification denitrification helps in maintaining the ph and eliminates the need of additional alkalinity the optimum conditions for anoxic nh4 n removal were observed at ph 7 and temperature of 25 30 c a decrease in nh4 n removal efficiency of the process was observed in the presence of higher concentrations of nh4 n 1000 mg l no2 n 200 mg l and s2 200 mg l the process is cost effective as it does not require any supply of aeration and alkalinity acknowledgment this work was supported by department of science and technology dst government

reduction was observed in 90 min of reaction time an increase of 26 of synergy with dual process was obtained in comparison to photocatalysis and photo fenton alone the beads were proved to be durable for more than 50 recycles for the inactivation of e coli to confirm the presence of tio2 morphological analysis and elemental composition for fresh as well as recycled composite beads was done using sem and eds respectively the activity of catalyst and presence of fe was also checked by using xrd ftir and drs keywords photocatalysis photo fenton fixed mode water e coli inactivation 1 introduction acceptance of oxidation technologies for water disinfection has been widely declined either due to their high cost e g ozonation or formation of disinfection byproducts e g chlorination problems are more severe in developing countries like india where population explosion and poor sanitation led to the contamination of ground and surface water in india only 4 of natural drinking water resources exist and their quality and quantity are rapidly declining 1 the contaminated water sources pose significant threat to environmental and human health leading to loss of life of more than 800 000 people annually around the world 2 4 moreover continual dependence on old conventional treatment techniques has drastically deepened the concern the presence of chlorinated disinfection byproduct which may be carcinogenic to humans 5 has directed scientists to look for alternative techniques for disinfection of water previous studies have reported the efficacy of advance technologies towards the treatment of different organic compounds 6 8 and disinfection of microorganisms 9 11 through microfiltration 12 advanced oxidation processes aops 13 and electro dialysis 14 although these technologies have some successful stories to tell yet utilization of these technologies in field scale application is very limited this might be due to the operational as well as technical drawbacks of aop technologies used while executing their scale up studies tio2 photocatalysis for example has been extensively used to overcome the challenges in energy 15 17 as well as in disinfection of water and wastewater 9 18 19 this process work on well established phenomena of the production of oxidative free radicals oh through charge carriers formed by excitation of e of the semiconductor and thus leading to redox reactions 20 use of this process in suspension as well as fixed form have reported many studies on inactivation of bacteria 21 24 owing to its potential for scaled up fixed bed studies used different support materials such as cylinders 25 plate 26 glass balls 27 polymers 28 29 for disinfection as well as degradation studies although very prominent in terms of its efficacy the major drawbacks include electron hole recombination separation of catalyst from the solution after the reaction 30 durability of support catalyst stability mass transfer limitation and increase in treatment time these aforementioned drawbacks question their viability for commercialization and thus limit its applications another important technique photo fenton has also been well reported in the literature for water disinfection as well as for the degradation of contaminants 11 31 35 in this homogeneous process reaction of h2o2 with fe2 in the presence of light and acidic ph generates strong reactive oxygen species such as oh 32 high doses of h2o2 along with formation of iron sludge are the main drawbacks there are a lot of studies where iron and tio2 was used together to increase the bacterial inactivation rate 36 39 zhang et al 38 reported the fe 3 doped tio2 catalyst coated over glass slides to study the inactivation rate of e coli and observed the killing of 95 of bacteria in 120 min of reaction time although this process helps in decreasing electron hole recombination yet stability of the catalyst is the major concern taking into consideration the advantages and drawbacks of aforementioned systems the present study proposes the in situ dual process of photocatalysis and photo fenton for the disinfection studies as per our knowledge this technique has not been reported for bacterial killing yet the fe tio2 composite in the form of spherical beads made up of clay and waste foundry sand fs and fly ash fa is capable of introducing the dual effect in the system fs fa being sources of iron leaches into the solution and thus triggers photo fenton reaction in the presence of h2o2 this composite retains the surface active tio2 layer which facilitates the photocatalysis the process is designed in such a way that a drawback of individual process is covered by other process happening in situ thus providing the synergy to the system production of iron waste foundry sand and fly ash from industrial processes is increasing rapidly and every year more than 99 million tons of foundry sand and 365 million tons of fly ash is produced worldwide 40 41 utilization of such waste as an absorbent 42 and as a construction material 43 has been reported but very few studies regarding its utilization in degradation of pollutants present in water 7 8 44 45 have been reported the present study successfully assimilated photocatalysis and photo fenton into one unit in fixed mode using industrial waste fs and fa as an iron source and mixing them with clay to form spherical beads this dual process is likely to increase the production of hydroxyl radical and utilization of iron reduces the electron hole recombination thus increasing the disinfection efficiency of the system to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported study in which both tio2 and iron source are completely immobilized to increase the inactivation efficiency of e coli present in water 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals and reagents all the chemicals were used as received tio2 p25 degussa was purchased from evonik enterprises mumbai india the oxidant 30 w v

fenton reaction and were provided from a local industry patiala punjab india sem eds for fa and fs were performed to check the iron content and the data are provided in the supplementary file fig s1 sodium acetate 98 5 and acetic acid 99 5 were obtained from tokyo chemical industry india to prepare the acetate buffer for ph control nacl 99 5 was obtained from s d fine chemical ambala haryana india to provide an isotonic solution for the bacterial cells luria bertani broth and agar agar type i for bacterial growth were purchased from himedia laboratories nasik india the double distilled water was used for the preparation of all solutions 2 2 preparation of composite beads and immobilization of tio2 clay was used as an inert support material and was mixed with fs and fa in the ratio of 2 1 1 respectively to form spherical beads manually the size of the bead was measured using screw gauge from at least four different directions to obtain the average size and subsequently the beads were grouped in three different sizes of 10 mm 15 mm and 20 mm this procedure was repeated for every composite bead and accordingly beads of equal diameter were selected after drying at room temperature these blank beads were muffled at 800 c for 2 h followed by immersion in water for curing to increase the strength of the inert material the coating of tio2 on these beads was executed using the dipping technique as previously described 45 1 solution of tio2 1 g in 100 ml was prepared using distilled water and sonicated for 20 min to achieve dispersion of tio2 nanoparticles after that beads were immersed in the tio2 solution for 24 h and adequate time and shaking were provided for coating the beads with tio2 for adequate coverage of the bead surface at least 2 coatings of tio2 were performed to achieve binding of tio2 on the beads they were muffled for 1 5 h at 350 c and then cooled at room temperature this process was repeated after each cycle of coating to fully coat the beads with tio2 afterwards the coated beads were washed with distilled water to remove the loosely attached tio2 and then oven dried the average thickness of coating over bead was 71 Œºm and the sem image for the same has been provided in supplementary file fig s2 2 3 bacterial strain and growth the e coli strain wild type k12 was bought from microbial type culture collection and gene bank mtcc no 1302 chandigarh india e coli is a gram negative bacteria and used as an indicator of fecal pollution in water for this study e coli was grown in miller s luria bertani broth lb tryptone 10 g l 1 yeast extract 5 g l 1 sodium chloride 10 g l 1 in double distilled water bacterial growth phase was monitored at an optical density of 600 nm until the stationary phase was reached 1 dilution was done in 50 ml of lb broth followed by overnight incubation of e coli at 37 c after the incubation cells were centrifuged at 4 c at 5000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant left after the centrifugation was removed and the bacterial pellet was washed with saline solution 0 8 of nacl finally the bacterial pellet was suspended into saline solution 25 ml to give a final concentration of 109 cfu ml 1 2 4 bacterial enumeration and sampling all the working solutions were sterilized using autoclave before use bacterial samples in the reactor were continuously aerated using spargers the flow rate of aeration was 3 l min 1 during each inactivation experiment 1 ml of sample was recovered from the reactor and stored at 4 c in 2 ml eppendorf tubes until the plating of cells was done viable cell count was done on petri plates containing lb and agar type 1 using standard plate count method serial dilution of the sterile saline solution of 9 ml from 10 1 to 10 7 was made and 0 1 ml of sample from the dilution tubes was plated on agar plates then the plates were kept in the incubator at 37 c for 24 h the inactivation efficiency was shown by log unit reduction of e coli lr l r a t a 0 where at and a0 are initial concentration and concentration at a particular treatment time respectively 2 5 characterization fresh and recycled spherical beads were characterized to confirm the presence of iron and tio2 through different techniques the surface morphology of tio2 coated over the surface of composite beads and the composition of the elements present on the surface of the beads were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem model no jsm 6510lv jeol japan and electron dispersive spectroscopy eds model no incax act oxford instruments uk respectively the band gap energy of tio2 was determined between the range of 200 800 nm by the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer drs uv 2600 shimadzu asia pacific the crystalline structure of tio2 on the composite beads was determined by x ray diffraction analysis using panalyticalxpert pro with cu kŒ± wavelength Œª 1 5405 between the range of 2Œ∏ 20 to 80 the catalyst over the surface of composite beads was also analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the infrared spectrum of the powered sample was analyzed in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 the generation of oh due the photocatalysis and photo fenton process was analyzed by fluorescence spectrophotometer at 460 nm in this method reaction of hydroxyl radical with sodium salts of terephthalic acid produces 2 hydroxy terephthalic acid fluorescent compound which can be measured by the fluorescence spectrophotometer to validate the production of hydroxyl radicals 2 6 experimental setup all the experiments were carried out inside a fully enclosed rectangular wooden chamber 1 37 m 0 9 m 1 06 m consisting of seven uv tubes philips 36 w 365 nm and was fixed on the ceiling of the wooden chamber 6 a borosilicate glass dish of 20 cm of diameter and 5 5 cm of height having a volume of 1000 ml was used as a reactor the reactor was placed under the uv lights on a laboratory jack so that the irradiation intensity can be changed by altering the height of the jack the average variation of uv radiation ranges between 10 to 24 wm 2 and was measured using a radiometer eppley model no 33013 the working solution contained 250 ml of double distilled water spiked with 106 cfu ml 1 of e coli then the solution was stirred for 20 min at room temperature for the acclimatization of bacteria and the tio2 immobilized composite beads were added to start the experiment to support the homogeneity of the reaction aeration 3 l min 1 was provided to the reactor with two spargers that were placed at equal distance from the center then the dual effect of the process simultaneous incorporation of photocatalysis and photo fenton in one unit was studied as shown in fig 1 for disinfection studies 1 ml of sample was taken out after regular intervals from the reactor and the decrease in the concentration of the e coli was calculated by plating method all the borosilicate reactors were washed and autoclaved prior to each reaction optimization of the process was done by varying different parameters such as h2o2 dose ph bead size uv intensity volume to area ratio based on which reaction kinetics was studied all experiments were performed in triplicates and the results show the average of the three samples and the error bars show the standard deviation in the figures statistical significance of the mean value of the treated samples was determined by the one way anova test all results were found to be significant as the f values were greater than 5 and p value 0 05 for all the experiments as shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composite beads as the system executes the dual process within the same unit there is a need to confirm both the components leading to photocatalysis and photo fenton on the surface of spherical beads for fresh as well as recycled composite beads characterization using different techniques was done 3 1 1 sem eds analysis to analyze the surface morphology as well as the composition of the elements on the composite beads uncoated freshly coated and recycled scanning electron microscopy sem along with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was performed and the results are shown in fig 2 the major peaks of fe o and tio2 on the eds image confirm the incorporation of both materials fe and tio2 in the dual process in freshly and recycled beads the existence of iron can be accredited to the utilization of fa fs with clay to form composite beads as no external iron was used for the process a relatively smooth surface can be seen in the sem image of freshly as well as recycled 50 times coated beads this indicates the presence of tio2 layer and its intactness before and after 50 recycles 3 1 2 uv vis drs analysis the composite beads fresh and recycled were analysed using uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs to confirm the light absorbing capacity of composite beads in visible spectra the analysis was carried out under the spectral range of 200 800 nm it can be seen in fig 3 a that the band gap energy decreases in composite beads thus showing its capability to absorb light in the visible region also as compared to tio2 this decrease in the band gap energy in composite beads may be due to the presence of iron the absorption wavelength of tio2 was 415 nm and extended to 430 nm and 452 nm for fresh and recycled composite beads respectively as shown in inset 3a the energy band gap was calculated using tauc eq 1 46 1 Œ± h œÖ 1 n a h œÖ e g where eg is energy band gap in ev h is planck s constant œÖ is photon frequency in hz a is proportionality constant the energy band gap of tio2 was 3 24 ev and reduced to 2 9 ev for fresh and recycled composite beads respectively 3 1 3 ftir analysis the characteristics and chemical bonds formed in fresh and recycled composite bead were also analyzed by ftir spectroscopy to confirm the presence of tio2 and iron in the system the infrared spectra of uncoated fresh and recycled composite beads are illustrated in fig 3 b presence of hoh stretching can be observed between 3441 cm 1 1674 6 cm 1 wave number the peak at 468 9 cm 1 in uncoated beads show the presence of siofe bond 47 the occurrence of the peaks between 558 cm 1 794 cm 1 wave number in uncoated beads analysis is due the formation of si o vibrations the occurrence of the peak between 400 1200 cm 1 wave number is due to the formation of tioti bond in the spectrum of both fresh and recycled composite beads this also proves the presence of tio2 lattice the anatase phase in case of fresh and recycled composite beads in the spectrum occurred at 432 cm 1and 501 3 cm 1 respectively this result is in confirmation with an earlier reported study 48 where anatase phase occurred between 400 600 cm 1 due to the occurrence of tioti vibrations the peak at 2304 cm 1 and at 2323 cm 1 in the spectra of fresh and recycled composite beads show the generation of feoti bond which also confirms the presence of iron in composite beads bansal et al 44 reported similar peaks for the presence of feoti bond in composite beads tioh bond was observed in fig 3 b at 1631 and 1613 cm 1 spectrum for the fresh and recycled composite beads respectively presence of oh group was also observed at 3247 cm 1 and 3374 cm 1 for fresh and recycled composite beads because of the stretching vibration as indicated in previous studies 48 49 3 1 4 xrd analysis to reaffirm the intactness of crystalline planes of tio2 for fresh and recycled beads the xrd analysis was carried out and the results are shown in fig 3 c the tio2 coated composite beads were calcined at 350 c for effective binding of catalyst to surface for this analysis tio2 particles were scrubbed off from the composite beads and selected to xrd analysis diffraction pattern in fig 3 c shows the presence of anatase a and rutile r phase of tio2 in fresh and recycled composite bead the presence of anatase and rutile phase with respectively even after 50 recycles shows that the tio2 over composite beads can be used for practical application besides these two phases of tio2 diffraction pattern also shows some other peaks of iron oxide io and titanium iron oxide tio respectively the presence of iron oxide facilitates the entrapment of photo excited e from tio2 photocatalysis for the regeneration of ferrous ion thus both processes of photocatalysis and photo fenton occur simultaneously in one unit 4 inactivation studies in fixed mode using composite beads 4 1 preliminary results the boundary condition of the experiments was set by performing the experiments in dark without using tio2 coating beads negligible log reduction of 0 007 in e coli count was observed as shown in fig 4 a this negligible reduction can be attributed to the fact that the double distilled water does not affect the viability of the e coli in 2 h of experiment any inactivation of the e coli cell might be due the osmotic pressure 10 fe leaching from the composite beads made of clay fs and fa had very little effect on the viability of e coli as confirmed by results showing 0 05 log unit reduction this loss in the viability of cells may have been due to the transportation of iron into the periplasm in the form of fe2 done by non specific porins present at the outer membrane of the cell followed by its transportation into the cytoplasm 50 this causes temporary disturbance of fe 2 balance in the cell 51 when h2o2 was added into the reactor its diffusion through lipids into the cell is possible because of osmotic stress conditions of the cell and also because of its comparable physical properties with h2o 52 inside the cell in the cytoplasm h2o2 is scavenged primarily by some enzymes acting as regulators such as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and most probably katg which regulates the respiratory system of the cell 53 likely due to this scavenging effect the unit log reduction caused by the addition of h2o2 was 0 09 in the fenton process fe2 and h2o2 can be transported into the cell as described above the inactivation rate of the fenton reaction is slowed down by the regeneration of fe3 to fe2 the maximum unit log reduction in this experiment was observed as 0 1 therefore it is clear from fig 4 a that the baseline process is showing negligible bacterial inactivation indicating potential for improvement for e coli inactivation using dual photocatalysis and photo fenton processes after analyzing the control experiments efforts were made to study the disinfection process under uv radiation average intensity 25 wm 2 for 90 min and the results from photo fenton photocatalysis and dual process in water have been presented in fig 4 b the experiments were carried out under acidic conditions because iron can only leach from the beads under acidic conditions this is because the iron in the soil is present in combination with other organic substances and acid helps in breaking the bond between them and helps in extracting the iron from clay called as iron leaching 54 the results showed that uv exposure alone at 365 nm achieved 1 1 log unit reduction when radiation falls on the cell it leads to bacterial inactivation via inactivation of antioxidant enzymes such as the catalases and the peroxidases 10 this inactivation of the enzymes lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species ros such as h2o2 1o2 and o 2 55 the ros formed can react with different cell components such as reaction of dna with 1o2 reduction of iron from the 4fe 4s clusters and its reaction such as unregulated h2o2 which causes internal photo fenton process by the iron inside the cell and the gathered oxidants 56 in the photo fenton process the addition of fe and h2o2 causes production of oh which starts degrading the cell wall externally under uv radiation the ferric ion fe3 can be reduced to ferrous ion fe2 via ligand to metal charge transfer lmct by the cell wall simultaneously the mechanisms of iron transport as well as the h2o2 transport would remain same inside the cell as previously explained bacterial inactivation due to photo fenton process is slightly higher than the photocatalysis showing log unit reductions of 3 3 and 3 2 respectively in 120 min of reaction time in the case of dual process the production of oh radicals is higher as compared to their production in photocatalysis and photo fenton process this process reduces the electron hole recombination via utilization of conduction band e to engage with fe3 for the production of fe2 thus leading to the photo fenton reaction in cyclic mode the dual process yielded a maximum 6 2 unit log reduction with a rate constant of 0 15 min 1 in 90 min whereas individual processes of photo fenton and photocatalysis took 120 min to yield 3 3 log unit reduction with 0 06 min 1 of rate constant and 3 2 log unit reduction with 0 05 min 1 of rate constant respectively as shown in fig 4 b c the occurrence of photocatalysis due to an active layer of tio2 was confirmed by sem eds as shown in fig 2 a and photo fenton process was confirmed by determining the leaching of ferrous and ferric ions from freshly coated beads and from the recycled beads at regular time intervals from standard method of apha 57 as shown in fig 5 4 2 effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration various researchers have reported the effect of h2o2 for photo fenton and photocatalysis 31 32 45 56 58 as it is a well established technique to add additional oh in the system however in this study the addition of h2o2 plays a dual role as it is being consumed in both processes simultaneously in a photocatalytic technique oxidants are added so that it reacts with the electron in the conduction band and prevents electron hole recombination as shown in eq 2 thus the optimization of its concentration was an important factor for both of the processes occurring in situ this dual process also increases the production of oxidizing species and hydroxide radicals in this study h2o2 concentration was optimized by varying its concentration from 0 12 0 42 g l 1 and the optimum concentration was determined as 0 3 g l 1 at ph 4 5 after optimizing the h2o2 dose an inactivation of 4 9 log unit was observed for e coli within 90 min of reaction time as shown in fig 6 a it can be seen in inset 6 a that the inactivation rate constant initially increased from 0 102 to 0 126 min 1 and started decreasing afterwards this decrease in the inactivation rate was likely due to the scavenging effect of h2o2 at high doses h2o2 likely started consuming oh as shown in eq 3 4 2 tio2 e h2o2 tio2 oh oh 3 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 4 ho2 oh h2o o2 4 3 effect of ph ph plays an important role in the dual process as the leaching of iron from composite beads takes place under acidic conditions and the iron executes photo fenton process in the system for the optimization of ph experiments were done at different ph values ranging from 2 5 6 5 and at 0 3 g l 1 h2o2 as shown in fig 6 b it was observed that at ph lower than 3 5 bacterial inactivation rate was lower owing to the scavenging effect of oh 44 subsequently when ph was increased from 3 5 6 5 the rate of inactivation decreased again as shown in inset 6 b this can be due to the precipitation of feo oh complex and hydrolysis of fe3 which ultimately decreases the production of oh radicals 8 it can be seen from fig 6 b that maximum inactivation of e coli 5 2 log unit reduction was achieved at ph 3 5 in 90 min which was used as the optimum ph for the rest of the study formation of less active ho2 occurs at alkaline ph values this consequently led to the formation of o2 and h2o on reaction with non dissociated h2o2 moreover the above reaction is preferred over reaction with oh therefore it is clear from the results that ph significantly influences the inactivation of e coli 4 4 effect of uv intensity in situ utilization of solar radiation in terms of process feasibility and bacterial inactivation is one of the most important factors for commercial aspects of this technology as irradiation coming from the sun does not remain constant throughout the day the effect of uv intensity variation 10 wm 2 to 25 wm 2 was studied for e coli inactivation it was observed that the maximum log unit reduction 5 9 was found in 90 min when the intensity of 25 wm 2 was provided to the system fig 6 c owing to the high production of oh this can be attributed to higher absorption of uv intensity by h2o2 at higher intensity 59 which subsequently enhance the oh it can be seen from inset c that the rate of inactivation increased from 0 11 m 1 to 0 15 m 1 with increase in the intensity to confirm the prominence of in situ dual effect florescence spectroscopy was performed for the estimation of oh at different intensities as shown in fig 6 d concentration of oh increased with increase in the uv intensity from 10 wm 2 to 25 wm 2 the results depicted reasonable log reduction of e coli at different uv intensities however the process can be intensified at lower intensities by effective reactor design and modifications 4 5 effect of bead size exposed surface area for the proper illumination of the catalyst is an important operational parameter in fixed bed studies to provide better contact between the contaminants and the catalyst 60 for field scale applications the type and size of the support material is particularly important for designing the reactor in this context the surface area of the composite bead was optimized by varying the size from 10 mm to 20 mm to achieve better inactivation of the e coli the size of the selected beads was varied by altering the diameter using screw gauge as discussed in section 2 2 it was observed from fig 7 a that the log unit reduction was maximum 6 logs when the size of the bead was 10 mm providing the highest surface area the log unit reduction of e coli decreased from 6 to 5 3 with increase in diameter of the beads and the rate constant k also decreased inset 7 b with increased bead size owing to the decrease in effective surface area available moreover reducing the size of composite bead below 10 mm could not help as this size was not able to hold the catalyst film intact too small beads would not have enough iron to leach out as fs fa concentration would be less therefore 10 mm size was found to be more stable in terms of catalyst activity as well as iron concentration and subsequently used for all the experiments 4 6 effect of area to volume ratio a v the major limitation of aop in the field scale application is the depth of the reactor as it hinders the path of solar radiation to reach the solution for better penetration of light more exposed area and less depth of reactor is considered appropriate 6 for this either area or volume of the reactor can be altered by keeping one of them same in this study a v ratio was varied from 0 18 cm2 ml 1 to 0 42 cm2 ml 1 by keeping the area same and varying the volume of the solution to investigate the inactivation of bacteria a significant increase in the log reduction of e coli from 4 9 to 6 2 was observed fig 7 b by increasing the a v ratio as the rate constant k increased as demonstrated in the inset 7 b as the a v ratio increases area is kept same volume decreases the path length of the photons of light entering the solution increases therefore resulting in more oh radical production 6 and hence the rate of bacterial inactivation increased as a result the optimized result for a v ratio was obtained as 0 25 cm2 ml 1 and showed the maximum e coli inactivation of 6 2 log unit reduction 4 7 durability studies another important parameter is the stability of the support material the support material should be stable enough to keep tio2 intact and sustain the iron leaching for the photo fenton process to investigate the durability of the support material the composite beads were recycled for 50 times as shown in fig 7 c and only 9 reduction in the activity of the beads was observed this minute loss can be attributed to the weathering of the catalyst from the composite beads 45 the various characterization techniques discussed above also confirms the stability and durability of the composite beads further to confirm the simultaneous leaching of the iron from the composite beads into the solution iron concentration was measured before and after 50 recycles 100 h of the beads as shown in fig 5 there was a significant amount of iron concentration observed before and after the recycling which contributed to the photo fenton process for further investigating the extend of the durability of the support material and the capacity to execute the in situ dual effect experiments were performed using composite beads recycled for more than 100 times significant log reduction 5 04 of e coli was achieved using the same optimized conditions these findings show the strong potential of this technology for field scale trials 4 8 kinetic study and synergy effect of dual process for the kinetic study of the dual process pseudo first order model was used as shown in eq 5 the slope of natural log a a0 and time for inactivation gives the rate constant as shown in eq 6 where a0 is the initial concentration of the bacteria at time t 0 a is the bacterial concentration at any time t and k is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 5 d a d t k 1 c 6 l n a a 0 k t for dual process the value of pseudo first order constant was higher as compared to the photocatalysis and photo fenton process as shown in table 2 the dual effect has shown better inactivation efficiency over photocatalysis and photo fenton individually during the inactivation studies of e coli it was observed that the synergistic effect of dual process over the photo fenton was 59 and on photocatalysis was 67 altogether the synergy of dual process over both the techniques was observed as 26 as calculated using the following eq s 7 9 all calculations regarding synergy effect are provided in supplementary file text s3 synergy of dual over photocatalysis 7 synergy 100 kdual kphotocatalysis kdual synergy of dual over photofenton process 8 synergy 100 kdual kphotofenton kdual synergy of dual over both photo fenton and photocatalysis 9 synergy 100 kdual kphotofenton kphotocatalysis kdual positive synergistic effect of the dual technique over both processes individually as well as combined process indicates the potential of this technology for possible field scale applications in this study experiment was also extended in sunlight uv visible at optimum conditions to confirm the viability of the process for real time application the optimum conditions for this study were same as for the reaction under uv radiation and 6 9 log reduction was observed in 30 min of reaction time 5 conclusion the present study was carried out to introduce hybridization of photo fenton and photocatalysis process for the inactivation of e coli using waste material such as fa and fs along with tio2 in fixed mode the results showed that parameters such as the intensity of light h2o2 dose and ph played a significant role in the inactivation of e coli photocatalysis using tio2 as a catalyst in the fixed mode resulted in 3 3 log reduction while photo fenton in fixed mode using fs and fa resulted in 3 2 log reduction after 120 min of reaction the inactivation time of e coli was reduced to 90 min with increase in the log reduction up to 6 2 when photo fenton and photocatalysis processes were incorporated in the same system under uv irradiation therefore this novel dual technique in fixed form proved to be a viable solution to treat contaminated water and wastewater the beads were recycled for 50 times with 9 decrease in the inactivation efficiency characterization of composite beads was done through sem eds xrd ftir and drs analysis which confirmed the stability and effectiveness of the beads after 50 recycles this is the first study

14193,applications of fe tio2 composite incorporating in situ dual effect of photocatalysis and photo fenton process was studied for inactivation of e coli k12 strain a thin film of tio2 was coated on spherical composite beads leading to photocatalysis comprising of clay foundry sand fs and fly ash fa from which iron leached out leading to photo fenton thus incorporating dual effect operating parameters such as uv light intensity size of beads addition of oxidant buffer and area volume ratio of the reactor were optimized for the inactivation of e coli in dual process 6 2 e coli log reduction was observed in 90 min of reaction time an increase of 26 of synergy with dual process was obtained in comparison to photocatalysis and photo fenton alone the beads were proved to be durable

which may be carcinogenic to humans 5 has directed scientists to look for alternative techniques for disinfection of water previous studies have reported the efficacy of advance technologies towards the treatment of different organic compounds 6 8 and disinfection of microorganisms 9 11 through microfiltration 12 advanced oxidation processes aops 13 and electro dialysis 14 although these technologies have some successful stories to tell yet utilization of these technologies in field scale application is very limited this might be due to the operational as well as technical drawbacks of aop technologies used while executing their scale up studies tio2 photocatalysis for example has been extensively used to overcome the challenges in energy 15 17 as well as in disinfection of water and wastewater 9 18 19 this process work on well established phenomena of the production of oxidative free radicals oh through charge carriers formed by excitation of e of the semiconductor and thus leading to redox reactions 20 use of this process in suspension as well as fixed form have reported many studies on inactivation of bacteria 21 24 owing to its potential for scaled up fixed bed studies used different support materials such as cylinders 25 plate 26 glass balls 27 polymers 28 29 for disinfection as well as degradation studies although very prominent in terms of its efficacy the major drawbacks include electron hole recombination separation of catalyst from the solution after the reaction 30 durability of support catalyst stability mass transfer limitation and increase in treatment time these aforementioned drawbacks question their viability for commercialization and thus limit its applications another important technique photo fenton has also been well reported in the literature for water disinfection as well as for the degradation of contaminants 11 31 35 in this homogeneous process reaction of h2o2 with fe2 in the presence of light and acidic ph generates strong reactive oxygen species such as oh 32 high doses of h2o2 along with formation of iron sludge are the main drawbacks there are a lot of studies where iron and tio2 was used together to increase the bacterial inactivation rate 36 39 zhang et al 38 reported the fe 3 doped tio2 catalyst coated over glass slides to study the inactivation rate of e coli and observed the killing of 95 of bacteria in 120 min of reaction time although this process helps in decreasing electron hole recombination yet stability of the catalyst is the major concern taking into consideration the advantages and drawbacks of aforementioned systems the present study proposes the in situ dual process of photocatalysis and photo fenton for the disinfection studies as per our knowledge this technique has not been reported for bacterial killing yet the fe tio2 composite in the form of spherical beads made up of clay and waste foundry sand fs and fly ash fa is capable of introducing the dual effect in the system fs fa being sources of iron leaches into the solution and thus triggers photo fenton reaction in the presence of h2o2 this composite retains the surface active tio2 layer which facilitates the photocatalysis the process is designed in such a way that a drawback of individual process is covered by other process happening in situ thus providing the synergy to the system production of iron waste foundry sand and fly ash from industrial processes is increasing rapidly and every year more than 99 million tons of foundry sand and 365 million tons of fly ash is produced worldwide 40 41 utilization of such waste as an absorbent 42 and as a construction material 43 has been reported but very few studies regarding its utilization in degradation of pollutants present in water 7 8 44 45 have been reported the present study successfully assimilated photocatalysis and photo fenton into one unit in fixed mode using industrial waste fs and fa as an iron source and mixing them with clay to form spherical beads this dual process is likely to increase the production of hydroxyl radical and utilization of iron reduces the electron hole recombination thus increasing the disinfection efficiency of the system to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported study in which both tio2 and iron source are completely immobilized to increase the inactivation efficiency of e coli

india to provide an isotonic solution for the bacterial cells luria bertani broth and agar agar type i for bacterial growth were purchased from himedia laboratories nasik india the double distilled water was used for the preparation of all solutions 2 2 preparation of composite beads and immobilization of tio2 clay was used as an inert support material and was mixed with fs and fa in the ratio of 2 1 1 respectively to form spherical beads manually the size of the bead was measured using screw gauge from at least four different directions to obtain the average size and subsequently the beads were grouped in three different sizes of 10 mm 15 mm and 20 mm this procedure was repeated for every composite bead and accordingly beads of equal diameter were selected after drying at room temperature these blank beads were muffled at 800 c for 2 h followed by immersion in water for curing to increase the strength of the inert material the coating of tio2 on these beads was executed using the dipping technique as previously described 45 1 solution of tio2 1 g in 100 ml was prepared using distilled water and sonicated for 20 min to achieve dispersion of tio2 nanoparticles after that beads were immersed in the tio2 solution for 24 h and adequate time and shaking were provided for coating the beads with tio2 for adequate coverage of the bead surface at least 2 coatings of tio2 were performed to achieve binding of tio2 on the beads they were muffled for 1 5 h at 350 c and then cooled at room temperature this process was repeated after each cycle of coating to fully coat the beads with tio2 afterwards the coated beads were washed with distilled water to remove the loosely attached tio2 and then oven dried the average thickness of coating over bead was 71 Œºm and the sem image for the same has been provided in supplementary file fig s2 2 3 bacterial strain and growth the e coli strain wild type k12 was bought from microbial type culture collection and gene bank mtcc no 1302 chandigarh india e coli is a gram negative bacteria and used as an indicator of fecal pollution in water for this study e coli was grown in miller s luria bertani broth lb tryptone 10 g l 1 yeast extract 5 g l 1 sodium chloride 10 g l 1 in double distilled water bacterial growth phase was monitored at an optical density of 600 nm until the stationary phase was reached 1 dilution was done in 50 ml of lb broth followed by overnight incubation of e coli at 37 c after the incubation cells were centrifuged at 4 c at 5000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant left after the centrifugation was removed and the bacterial pellet was washed with saline solution 0 8 of nacl finally the bacterial pellet was suspended into saline solution 25 ml to give a final concentration of 109 cfu ml 1 2 4 bacterial enumeration and sampling all the working solutions were sterilized using autoclave before use bacterial samples in the reactor were continuously aerated using spargers the flow rate of aeration was 3 l min 1 during each inactivation experiment 1 ml of sample was recovered from the reactor and stored at 4 c in 2 ml eppendorf tubes until the plating of cells was done viable cell count was done on petri plates containing lb and agar type 1 using standard plate count method serial dilution of the sterile saline solution of 9 ml from 10 1 to 10 7 was made and 0 1 ml of sample from the dilution tubes was plated on agar plates then the plates were kept in the incubator at 37 c for 24 h the inactivation efficiency was shown by log unit reduction of e coli lr l r a t a 0 where at and a0 are initial concentration and concentration at a particular treatment time respectively 2 5 characterization fresh and recycled spherical beads were characterized to confirm the presence of iron and tio2 through different techniques the surface morphology of tio2 coated over the surface of composite beads and the composition of the elements present on the surface of the beads were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem model no jsm 6510lv jeol japan and electron dispersive spectroscopy eds model no incax act oxford instruments uk respectively the band gap energy of tio2 was determined between the range of 200 800 nm by the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectrometer drs uv 2600 shimadzu asia pacific the crystalline structure of tio2 on the composite beads was determined by x ray diffraction analysis using panalyticalxpert pro with cu kŒ± wavelength Œª 1 5405 between the range of 2Œ∏ 20 to 80 the catalyst over the surface of composite beads was also analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the infrared spectrum of the powered sample was analyzed in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 the generation of oh due the photocatalysis and photo fenton process was analyzed by fluorescence spectrophotometer at 460 nm in this method reaction of hydroxyl radical with sodium salts of terephthalic acid produces 2 hydroxy terephthalic acid fluorescent compound which can be measured by the fluorescence spectrophotometer to validate the production of hydroxyl radicals 2 6 experimental setup all the experiments were carried out inside a fully enclosed rectangular wooden chamber 1 37 m 0 9 m 1 06 m consisting of seven uv tubes philips 36 w 365 nm and was fixed on the ceiling of the wooden chamber 6 a borosilicate glass dish of 20 cm of diameter and 5 5 cm of height having a volume of 1000 ml was used as a reactor the reactor was placed under the uv lights on a laboratory jack so that the irradiation intensity can be changed by altering the height of the jack the average variation of uv radiation ranges between 10 to 24 wm 2 and was measured using a radiometer eppley model no 33013 the working solution contained 250 ml of double distilled water spiked with 106 cfu ml 1 of e coli then the solution was stirred for 20 min at room temperature for the acclimatization of bacteria and the tio2 immobilized composite beads were added to start the experiment to support the homogeneity of the reaction aeration 3 l min 1 was provided to the reactor with two spargers that were placed at equal distance from the center then the dual effect of the process simultaneous incorporation of photocatalysis and photo fenton in one unit was studied as shown in fig 1 for disinfection studies 1 ml of sample was taken out after regular intervals from the reactor and the decrease in the concentration of the e coli was calculated by plating method all the borosilicate reactors were washed and autoclaved prior to each reaction optimization of the process was done by varying different parameters such as h2o2 dose ph bead size uv intensity volume to area ratio based on which reaction kinetics was studied all experiments were performed in triplicates and the results show the average of the three samples and the error bars show the standard deviation in the figures statistical significance of the mean value of the treated samples was determined by the one way anova test all results were found to be significant as the f values were greater than 5 and p value 0 05 for all the experiments as shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composite beads as the system executes the dual process within the same unit there is a need to confirm both the components leading to photocatalysis and photo fenton on the surface of spherical beads for fresh as well as recycled composite beads characterization using different techniques was done 3 1 1 sem eds analysis to analyze the surface morphology as well as the composition of the elements on the composite beads uncoated freshly coated and recycled scanning electron microscopy sem along with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was performed and the results are shown in fig 2 the major peaks of fe o and tio2 on the eds image confirm the incorporation of both materials fe and tio2 in the dual process in freshly and recycled beads the existence of iron can be accredited to the utilization of fa fs with clay to form composite beads as no external iron was used for the process a relatively smooth surface can be seen in the sem image of freshly as well as recycled 50 times coated beads this indicates the presence of tio2 layer and its intactness before and after 50 recycles 3 1 2 uv vis drs analysis the composite beads fresh and recycled were analysed using uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs to confirm the light absorbing capacity of composite beads in visible spectra the analysis was carried out under the spectral range of 200 800 nm it can be seen in fig 3 a that the band gap energy decreases in composite beads thus showing its capability to absorb light in the visible region also as compared to tio2 this decrease in the band gap energy in composite beads may be due to the presence of iron the absorption wavelength of tio2 was 415 nm and extended to 430 nm and 452 nm for fresh and recycled composite beads respectively as shown in inset 3a the energy band gap was calculated using tauc eq 1 46 1 Œ± h œÖ 1 n a h œÖ e g where eg is energy band gap in ev h is planck s constant œÖ is photon frequency in hz a is proportionality constant the energy band gap of tio2 was 3 24 ev and reduced to 2 9 ev for fresh and recycled composite beads respectively 3 1 3 ftir analysis the characteristics and chemical bonds formed in fresh and recycled composite bead were also analyzed by ftir spectroscopy to confirm the presence of tio2 and iron in the system the infrared spectra of uncoated fresh and recycled composite beads are illustrated in fig 3 b presence of hoh stretching can be observed between 3441 cm 1 1674 6 cm 1 wave number the peak at 468 9 cm 1 in uncoated beads show the presence of siofe bond 47 the occurrence of the peaks between 558 cm 1 794 cm 1 wave number in uncoated beads analysis is due the formation of si o vibrations the occurrence of the peak between 400 1200 cm 1 wave number is due to the formation of tioti bond in the spectrum of both fresh and recycled composite beads this also proves the presence of tio2 lattice the anatase phase in case of fresh and recycled composite beads in the spectrum occurred at 432 cm 1and 501 3 cm 1 respectively this result is in confirmation with an earlier reported study 48 where anatase phase occurred between 400 600 cm 1 due to the occurrence of tioti vibrations the peak at 2304 cm 1 and at 2323 cm 1 in the spectra of fresh and recycled composite beads show the generation of feoti bond which also confirms the presence of iron in composite beads bansal et al 44 reported similar peaks for the presence of feoti bond in composite beads tioh bond was observed in fig 3 b at 1631 and 1613 cm 1 spectrum for the fresh and recycled composite beads respectively presence of oh group was also observed at 3247 cm 1 and 3374 cm 1 for fresh and recycled composite beads because of the stretching vibration as indicated in previous studies 48 49 3 1 4 xrd analysis to reaffirm the intactness of crystalline planes of tio2 for fresh and recycled beads the xrd analysis was carried out and the results are shown in fig 3 c the tio2 coated composite beads were calcined at 350 c for effective binding of catalyst to surface for this analysis tio2 particles were scrubbed off from the composite beads and selected to xrd analysis diffraction pattern in fig 3 c shows the presence of anatase a and rutile r phase of tio2 in fresh and recycled composite bead the presence of anatase and rutile phase with respectively even after 50 recycles shows that the tio2 over composite beads can be used for practical application besides these two phases of tio2 diffraction pattern also shows some other peaks of iron oxide io and titanium iron oxide tio respectively the presence of iron oxide facilitates the entrapment of photo excited e from tio2 photocatalysis for the regeneration of ferrous ion thus both processes of photocatalysis and photo fenton occur simultaneously in one unit 4 inactivation studies in fixed mode using composite beads 4 1 preliminary results the boundary condition of the experiments was set by performing the experiments in dark without using tio2 coating beads negligible log reduction of 0 007 in e coli count was observed as shown in fig 4 a this negligible reduction can be attributed to the fact that the double distilled water does not affect the viability of the e coli in 2 h of experiment any inactivation of the e coli cell might be due the osmotic pressure 10 fe leaching from the composite beads made of clay fs and fa had very little effect on the viability of e coli as confirmed by results showing 0 05 log unit reduction this loss in the viability of cells may have been due to the transportation of iron into the periplasm in the form of fe2 done by non specific porins present at the outer membrane of the cell followed by its transportation into the cytoplasm 50 this causes temporary disturbance of fe 2 balance in the cell 51 when h2o2 was added into the reactor its diffusion through lipids into the cell is possible because of osmotic stress conditions of the cell and also because of its comparable physical properties with h2o 52 inside the cell in the cytoplasm h2o2 is scavenged primarily by some enzymes acting as regulators such as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and most probably katg which regulates the respiratory system of the cell 53 likely due to this scavenging effect the unit log reduction caused by the addition of h2o2 was 0 09 in the fenton process fe2 and h2o2 can be transported into the cell as described above the inactivation rate of the fenton reaction is slowed down by the regeneration of fe3 to fe2 the maximum unit log reduction in this experiment was observed as 0 1 therefore it is clear from fig 4 a that the baseline process is showing negligible bacterial inactivation indicating potential for improvement for e coli inactivation using dual photocatalysis and photo fenton processes after analyzing the control experiments efforts were made to study the disinfection process under uv radiation average intensity 25 wm 2 for 90 min and the results from photo fenton photocatalysis and dual process in water have been presented in fig 4 b the experiments were carried out under acidic conditions because iron can only leach from the beads under acidic conditions this is because the iron in the soil is present in combination with other organic substances and acid helps in breaking the bond between them and helps in extracting the iron from clay called as iron leaching 54 the results showed that uv exposure alone at 365 nm achieved 1 1 log unit reduction when radiation falls on the cell it leads to bacterial inactivation via inactivation of antioxidant enzymes such as the catalases and the peroxidases 10 this inactivation of the enzymes lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species ros such as h2o2 1o2 and o 2 55 the ros formed can react with different cell components such as reaction of dna with 1o2 reduction of iron from the 4fe 4s clusters and its reaction such as unregulated h2o2 which causes internal photo fenton process by the iron inside the cell and the gathered oxidants 56 in the photo fenton process the addition of fe and h2o2 causes production of oh which starts degrading the cell wall externally under uv radiation the ferric ion fe3 can be reduced to ferrous ion fe2 via ligand to metal charge transfer lmct by the cell wall simultaneously the mechanisms of iron transport as well as the h2o2 transport would remain same inside the cell as previously explained bacterial inactivation due to photo fenton process is slightly higher than the photocatalysis showing log unit reductions of 3 3 and 3 2 respectively in 120 min of reaction time in the case of dual process the production of oh radicals is higher as compared to their production in photocatalysis and photo fenton process this process reduces the electron hole recombination via utilization of conduction band e to engage with fe3 for the production of fe2 thus leading to the photo fenton reaction in cyclic mode the dual process yielded a maximum 6 2 unit log reduction with a rate constant of 0 15 min 1 in 90 min whereas individual processes of photo fenton and photocatalysis took 120 min to yield 3 3 log unit reduction with 0 06 min 1 of rate constant and 3 2 log unit reduction with 0 05 min 1 of rate constant respectively as shown in fig 4 b c the occurrence of photocatalysis due to an active layer of tio2 was confirmed by sem eds as shown in fig 2 a and photo fenton process was confirmed by determining the leaching of ferrous and ferric ions from freshly coated beads and from the recycled beads at regular time intervals from standard method of apha 57 as shown in fig 5 4 2 effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration various researchers have reported the effect of h2o2 for photo fenton and photocatalysis 31 32 45 56 58 as it is a well established technique to add additional oh in the system however in this study the addition of h2o2 plays a dual role as it is being consumed in both processes simultaneously in a photocatalytic technique oxidants are added so that it reacts with the electron in the conduction band and prevents electron hole recombination as shown in eq 2 thus the optimization of its concentration was an important factor for both of the processes occurring in situ this dual process also increases the production of oxidizing species and hydroxide radicals in this study h2o2 concentration was optimized by varying its concentration from 0 12 0 42 g l 1 and the optimum concentration was determined as 0 3 g l 1 at ph 4 5 after optimizing the h2o2 dose an inactivation of 4 9 log unit was observed for e coli within 90 min of reaction time as shown in fig 6 a it can be seen in inset 6 a that the inactivation rate constant initially increased from 0 102 to 0 126 min 1 and started decreasing afterwards this decrease in the inactivation rate was likely due to the scavenging effect of h2o2 at high doses h2o2 likely started consuming oh as shown in eq 3 4 2 tio2 e h2o2 tio2 oh oh 3 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 4 ho2 oh h2o o2 4 3 effect of ph ph plays an important role in the dual process as the leaching of iron from composite beads takes place under acidic conditions and the iron executes photo fenton process in the system for the optimization of ph experiments were done at different ph values ranging from 2 5 6 5 and at 0 3 g l 1 h2o2 as shown in fig 6 b it was observed that at ph lower than 3 5 bacterial inactivation rate was lower owing to the scavenging effect of oh 44 subsequently when ph was increased from 3 5 6 5 the rate of inactivation decreased again as shown in inset 6 b this can be due to the precipitation of feo oh complex and hydrolysis of fe3 which ultimately decreases the production of oh radicals 8 it can be seen from fig 6 b that maximum inactivation of e coli 5 2 log unit reduction was achieved at ph 3 5 in 90 min which was used as the optimum ph for the rest of the study formation of less active ho2 occurs at alkaline ph values this consequently led to the formation of o2 and h2o on reaction with non dissociated h2o2 moreover the above reaction is preferred over reaction with oh therefore it is clear from the results that ph significantly influences the inactivation of e coli 4 4 effect of uv intensity in situ utilization of solar radiation in terms of process feasibility and bacterial inactivation is one of the most important factors for commercial aspects of this technology as irradiation coming from the sun does not remain constant throughout the day the effect of uv intensity variation 10 wm 2 to 25 wm 2 was studied for e coli inactivation it was observed that the maximum log unit reduction 5 9 was found in 90 min when the intensity of 25 wm 2 was provided to the system fig 6 c owing to the high production of oh this can be attributed to higher absorption of uv intensity by h2o2 at higher intensity 59 which subsequently enhance the oh it can be seen from inset c that the rate of inactivation increased from 0 11 m 1 to 0 15 m 1 with increase in the intensity to confirm the prominence of in situ dual effect florescence spectroscopy was performed for the estimation of oh at different intensities as shown in fig 6 d concentration of oh increased with increase in the uv intensity from 10 wm 2 to 25 wm 2 the results depicted reasonable log reduction of e coli at different uv intensities however the process can be intensified at lower intensities by effective reactor design and modifications 4 5 effect of bead size exposed surface area for the proper illumination of the catalyst is an important operational parameter in fixed bed studies to provide better contact between the contaminants and the catalyst 60 for field scale applications the type and size of the support material is particularly important for designing the reactor in this context the surface area of the composite bead was optimized by varying the size from 10 mm to 20 mm to achieve better inactivation of the e coli the size of the selected beads was varied by altering the diameter using screw gauge as discussed in section 2 2 it was observed from fig 7 a that the log unit reduction was maximum 6 logs when the size of the bead was 10 mm providing the highest surface area the log unit reduction of e coli decreased from 6 to 5 3 with increase in diameter of the beads and the rate constant k also decreased inset 7 b with increased bead size owing to the decrease in effective surface area available moreover reducing the size of composite bead below 10 mm could not help as this size was not able to hold the catalyst film intact too small beads would not have enough iron to leach out as fs fa concentration would be less therefore 10 mm size was found to be more stable in terms of catalyst activity as well as iron concentration and subsequently used for all the experiments 4 6 effect of area to volume ratio a v the major limitation of aop in the field scale application is the depth of the reactor as it hinders the path of solar radiation to reach the solution for better penetration of light more exposed area and less depth of reactor is considered appropriate 6 for this either area or volume of the reactor can be altered by keeping one of them same in this study a v ratio was varied from 0 18 cm2 ml 1 to 0 42 cm2 ml 1 by keeping the area same and varying the volume of the solution to investigate the inactivation of bacteria a significant increase in the log reduction of e coli from 4 9 to 6 2 was observed fig 7 b by increasing the a v ratio as the rate constant k increased as demonstrated in the inset 7 b as the a v ratio increases area is kept same volume decreases the path length of the photons of light entering the solution increases therefore resulting in more oh radical production 6 and hence the rate of bacterial inactivation increased as a result the optimized result for a v ratio was obtained as 0 25 cm2 ml 1 and showed the maximum e coli inactivation of 6 2 log unit reduction 4 7 durability studies another important parameter is the stability of the support material the support material should be stable enough to keep tio2 intact and sustain the iron leaching for the photo fenton process to investigate the durability of the support material the composite beads were recycled for 50 times as shown in fig 7 c and only 9 reduction in the activity of the beads was observed this minute loss can be attributed to the weathering of the catalyst from the composite beads 45 the various characterization techniques discussed above also confirms the stability and durability of the composite beads further to confirm the simultaneous leaching of the iron from the composite beads into the solution iron concentration was measured before and after 50 recycles 100 h of the beads as shown in fig 5 there was a significant amount of iron concentration observed before and after the recycling which contributed to the photo fenton process for further investigating the extend of the durability of the support material and the capacity to execute the in situ dual effect experiments were performed using composite beads recycled for more than 100 times significant log reduction 5 04 of e coli was achieved using the same optimized conditions these findings show the strong potential of this technology for field scale trials 4 8 kinetic study and synergy effect of dual process for the kinetic study of the dual process pseudo first order model was used as shown in eq 5 the slope of natural log a a0 and time for inactivation gives the rate constant as shown in eq 6 where a0 is the initial concentration of the bacteria at time t 0 a is the bacterial concentration at any time t and k is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 5 d a d t k 1 c 6 l n a a 0 k t for dual process the value of pseudo first order constant was higher as compared to the photocatalysis and photo fenton process as shown in table 2 the dual effect has shown better inactivation efficiency over photocatalysis and photo fenton individually during the inactivation studies of e coli it was observed that the synergistic effect of dual process over the photo fenton was 59 and on photocatalysis was 67 altogether the synergy of dual process over both the techniques was observed as 26 as calculated using the following eq s 7 9 all calculations regarding synergy effect are provided in supplementary file text s3 synergy of dual over photocatalysis 7 synergy 100 kdual kphotocatalysis kdual synergy of dual over photofenton process 8 synergy 100 kdual kphotofenton kdual synergy of dual over both photo fenton and photocatalysis 9 synergy 100 kdual kphotofenton kphotocatalysis kdual positive synergistic effect of the dual technique over both processes individually as well as combined process indicates the potential of this technology for possible field scale applications in this study experiment was also extended in sunlight uv visible at optimum conditions to confirm the viability of the process for real time application the optimum conditions for this study were same as for the reaction under uv radiation and 6 9 log reduction was observed in 30 min of reaction time 5 conclusion the present study was carried out to introduce hybridization of photo fenton and photocatalysis process for the inactivation of e coli using waste material such as fa and fs along with tio2 in fixed mode the results showed that parameters such as the intensity of light h2o2 dose and ph played a significant role in the inactivation of e coli photocatalysis using tio2 as a catalyst in the fixed mode resulted in 3 3 log reduction while photo fenton in fixed mode using fs and fa resulted in 3 2 log reduction after 120 min of reaction the inactivation time of e coli was reduced to 90 min with increase in the log reduction up to 6 2 when photo fenton and photocatalysis processes were incorporated in the same system under uv irradiation therefore this novel dual technique in fixed form proved to be a viable solution to treat contaminated water and wastewater the beads were recycled for 50 times with 9 decrease in the inactivation efficiency characterization of composite beads was done through sem eds xrd ftir and drs analysis which confirmed the stability and effectiveness of the beads after 50 recycles this is the first study

ammonia removal 1 introduction ammonia is an essential compound that can be the basic need of the plant as the source of nutrient up to the wide potential application of the industrial namely the feedstock of nitrogen for the agriculture as well as the refrigerant 1 2 apart from the important notes of the ammonia in many applications the excessive presence of this compound may turn it into a toxic contaminant according to karasik 2002 an exposure of 30 min of 500 mg l of ammonia can causes irreversible effects whereas the exposure for 60 min of 3400 mg l of ammonia could be fatal to any living organism 3 on the other hand the excessive amount of ammonia could trigger the algal bloom and thus lead to the eutrophication phenomenon of the aquatic ecosystem 4 the consequence of this phenomena including undesirable disturbance to the organisms balance as well as depletion of the water quality concerned the elimination of the ammoniacal contaminant has become the major concern for the past few decades many approaches have been attempted in removing this toxic material from the water bodies including air stripping biological treatment nitrification denitrification ion exchange etc 5 8 the efficiency of removal processes of biological treatment nitrification denitrification and air stripping is significantly influenced by the surrounding and notably impaired by the low temperature during winter as well as cost consuming due to the complicated treatment process 9 therefore it was found that ion exchange has remarkably shows the promising ammonia removal of all the available methods 10 one of the excellent ion exchanger that has high affinity towards ammonium ion is natural zeolite 11 natural zeolite with porous structure possesses valuable physicochemical properties comprising high void volume for bigger surface area influential cation selectivity and high cation exchange capacity 12 of all the natural zeolites clinoptilolite has been widely used and reported in removing ammonia from water 13 14 clinoptilolite is also known as one of the ion exchangers with a high affinity for ammonium ion clinoptilolite shows a classical aluminosilicate structure and hence possesses important macroporosity naturally the cations appear on clinoptilolite are sodium potassium and calcium the selectivity order of natural zeolite among cations shows that ammonium ion is one of the highest selected cations toward zeolite 11 therefore it is strongly believed that natural zeolite has an ability in the removal of ammonia from the solution concerning adsorption and ion exchange feature the capability of these zeolites in removing the ammonia lies in the range of 2 7 mg g to 30 6 mg g of adsorption capacities 14 15 however these adsorption approaches of powder suspension for the ammonia uptake was inconvenient due to secondary treatment requirement namely filtration upon the adsorption process has taken place this filtration process has eventually resulting in the loss of adsorbent during the process and the possibility of adsorbent leachate to the filtrate solution these weaknesses have eventually depreciating the good reputation of this technique recently adsorptive membranes which combines the advantages of membrane technology and adsorption process have become as an effective way to remove contaminant ions from aqueous solutions hence the contaminant ions can be removed from aqueous solutions when the metal ions in the solutions are in contact with the surfaces of the membranes even though the pore sizes of the membranes may be much larger than the dimensions of the metal ions 16 in comparison with the conventional microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes the adsorptive membranes provide the advantages of high retaining efficiency for contaminant ions together with the benefits of low energy consumption and high permeate flux 17 with the application of such adsorptive membranes the function of the membrane process can be expanded from filtration solely to the hybrid process of filtration adsorption which might lead to synergistic effect to date most of the adsorptive membranes are composed of polymer type membranes either natural or synthetic polymers embedded with the adsorbent 18 19 a study was reported on the fabrication of mixed matrix membrane from natural zeolite that was incorporated into the polyether sulfone polymer matrix 20 the membrane demonstrated high capacity and high stability towards ammonium in wastewater this mixed matrix adsorptive membrane may suffer from few limitations the impregnation of the adsorbent onto the host polymer membrane may reduce the surface area of the adsorbent to which plays the most important role in the adsorption effectiveness additionally the regeneration process of the saturated adsorptive membrane may lead to the leaching of the adsorbent from the polymer matrix in general there are few articles reported on the utilization of the clinoptilolite as the adsorptive membrane and none of its kind to be focused on the development of the ceramic adsorptive membrane for the adsorption of ammonia in water the previously reported study was focusing on the utilization of the clinoptilolite based adsorptive membrane for the removal of chromium vi from the water 21 on the contrary this study aims for the fabrication of the adsorptive hollow fibre ceramic membrane hfcm derived from clinoptilolite specifically for the ammonia removal in wastewater additionally the performance of ammonia removal via adsorption using this membrane was experimented at various ph of the ammonia feed solution conditions thus evaluating the interaction between the adsorptive hfcm to the adsorbed ammonia the hfcm fabrication parameter of different sintering temperature towards the physicochemical properties of the membrane was examined in this study the appropriate sintering temperature is crucial to produce the membrane with right membrane morphology that eventually contributed to the best water permeability 22 this will eventually determine the efficacy of the produced membrane in the ammonia removal via adsorption process which attributed by the optimum residence time adsorption contact time that is achievable by the membrane with the best water permeability 23 the study of such parameters is a new sight and perspective in developing the adsorptive membrane technology moreover most of the reported adsorption studies are mainly in the form of conventional powder suspension adsorbent to which requires the improvisations in their performances due to many limitations 24 25 additionally the adsorption kinetics of the membrane has also investigated in this study 2 experimental 2 1 materials the starting materials of natural zeolite clinoptilolite powder with average particle size of 70 Œºm was purchased from liaoning province china shijiazhuang mining trade co ltd polyethersulfone pesf radal a300 ameco performance usa n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp ar grade qrec rathburn uk and arlacel p135 polyethyleneglycol 30 dipolyhydroxystearate uniqema croda uk were used as polymer binder solvent and dispersant respectively 25 ammonia solution ar grade qrec merck germany was used to prepare the synthetic ammoniacal wastewater in membrane performance study 2 2 adsorptive membrane preparation the adsorptive clinoptilolite based hfcm was prepared by phase inversion based extrusion sintering technique using the composition as reported in the previous study 21 firstly the dispersant arlacel p135 was dissolved in nmp under vigorous stirring once a homogeneous solution was formed the ground sieved and pre dried zeolite powder of 36 Œºm was slowly added into the solution based upon the weight ratio 45 wt and the suspension was subsequently subjected to ball milling using nqm 2 planetary ball mill after 48 h of milling pesf of the desired weight was added into the dope and milling continued for another 48 h the resulted suspension was then degassed for 30 min at room temperature to eliminate the air bubbles after degassing the dope suspension was introduced into a syringe pump phd 2000 harvard apparatus usa and extruded through a tube in orifice spinneret with specified diameter of inner contour of 0 5 mm and outer diameter of 2 8 mm using extrusion parameter of 10 ml min for dope suspension extrusion rate 15 ml min of bore fluid flowrate and 5 cm of air gap distance tap water was used as the internal coagulant after travelling a certain air gap distance the fibre membrane green bodies were immersed in a water coagulant bath for 24 h to allow the completion of the phase inversion process afterwards they were dried at room temperature for 24 h finally the fibre precursors were sintered in tubular furnace xy 1700 magna protech china under air environment for 4 h at various targeted temperatures in the range of 900 1150 c the heating rate was 2 c min throughout the heating and cooling process of sintering the fabrication of the zeolite based hfcm was exactly followed the steps done in previous study with slightly modification that involving the ceramic composition loading and the grade of the ceramic particle size 26 2 3 characterization of hfcm the scanning electron microscope sem was used to examine the morphological behavior of the hfcm prior to the morphological analysis using the sem hitachi model tm 3000 japan the sample of hfcm was gold coated and sputtered with gold for 3 min under the vacuum condition these analyses consisted of cross sectional anatomy of the membranes the x ray diffraction xrd analysis was examined using xrd bruker axs d8 germany with cu kŒ± radiation Œª 1 5406 «ª the elemental composition of the natural zeolite raw powder and hfcm sintered at different temperature was investigated using x ray fluorescence xrf axios sequential wd xrf panalytical 2005 netherlands the mechanical strength of the membrane was measured using three point bending machine instron model 3342 usa the flexural strength of the membrane was calculated using the following equation 27 1 œÉ f 8 f l d o œÄ d o 4 d i 4 where f is the maximum load at which the fracture occurred while l do and di are the length of span 43 mm the outer diameter and the inner diameter of the hollow fibres respectively the water permeation flux f l m2 h was calculated using eq 2 where v a and t are the volume of the permeate l membrane area m2 and time h respectively 28 2 f v a t 2 4 adsorptive membrane performance the ammonia removal performance of the hfcm via adsorption process was done using the dead end water permeation setup with 50 mg l of synthetic ammonia wastewater at 25 c the feed solution was prepared by diluting 25 ammonia stock solution to 40 mg l with ph 10 without modification upon preparation the ph was kept high due to a report stated that increasing the ph value of the feed will eventually promote the removal of ammonia 29 the feed solution was passed through the dead end epoxy coated adsorptive hfcm with a crossflow setup module dimension of 10 cm with 2 cm in diameter as shown in fig 1 the experiment was run at ambient room temperature of 27 c throughout the adsorption process the ammonia content of both feed and permeate solutions for each analysis was determine using uv vis spectrophotometry analysis hach model dr 5000 canada with the aid of ammoniacal reagent kit containing of ammonium salicylate and ammonium cyanurate as the colour indicator for the ammonia content the colour intensities was measured in the mode of absorbance and translated into the ammonia content upon the comparison to that of calibration curve prepared prior of the uv vis analyses the ammonia removal performance was calculated using the following equation 21 3 r c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the ammonia concentration mg l in the feed and permeate respectively 2 4 1 adsorption kinetics the optimum time taken for the ammonia adsorption to attain equilibrium was determined as a function of contact time the amount of the hfcm used was fixed at 0 4 g l with effective area of 6 195 10 4 m2 and the contact time was studied in the range of 5 180 min of 100 ml of 50 mg l ammonia solution at fixed ph 7 and 25 c the adsorption capacity of the hfcm was calculated using the following equation 30 4 q e c f c e v m where cf and ce are the ammonia feed concentration and equilibrium ammonia concentration mg l v is the volume of the permeate solution l and m is the mass of hfcm g 2 4 2 effect of feed solution ph on the ammonia adsorption the performance parameters namely ph of the feed has been studied for these purposes the ph effect was evaluated in the range of ph 2 11 of 50 mg l ammonia solution for 3 h the feed initial ph was adjusted by 1 m naoh or hcl solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of hfcm sintered at different temperatures 3 1 1 physicochemical behavior the sem micrographs of the cross sectional hfcm are depicted in fig 2 the sem micrograph indicates that the grain growth of the ceramic has been occurred upon the sintering process has taken place fig 3 illustrates the grain growth process of ceramic particle during the sintering process the micrographs shown in fig 2 have also showed that the densification of the hfcm is remarkably obvious along with the increment in sintering temperature this phenomenon is more profound in the cross sectional images as the ceramic particles were found merging to one another and thus the bigger grains were formed at higher temperature additionally the densified membrane sintered at higher temperature possessed the formation of bigger void resulting from the interparticle space left after the grain growing process these voids will eventually form the dead end pores and or tunnels across the membrane this defect structures will be affecting the physicochemical properties of the membrane and thus reducing its adsorption performance in the adsorptive membrane process the fast permeation of the water can be due to the loosely packed ceramic particles or due to the defect structure of the membrane the fast permeation will lead to the shorter residence time to which eventually provided insufficient time for the adsorption to be occurred 23 additionally the void structures can lead to the escapism of the ammonia from undergoing the adsorption process similar findings on the effect of sintering temperature on the physiochemical properties of the ceramic membrane have been reported in several studies 21 31 32 apart from the microstructure of the membrane the increment of the sintering temperature has also influenced the membrane physical appearance it was found that the membrane thickness has significantly decreased upon the escalation of the sintering temperature from 189 Œºm for hfcm sintered at 900 c to 148 Œºm for the hfcm sintered at 1150 c this phenomenon could be attributable by the densification of the ceramic particles within the membrane 33 these densified membranes are composed of closely packed grains and thus the thinning process the membrane could profoundly observed the reduction of the membrane thickness can be seen from fig 2a2 to fig 2f2 additionally the consideration of the material selection prior the sintering process should be taken into account the best sintering temperature normally approaching the melting point of the ceramic material used for the fabrication of the ceramic membrane apart from the determination of the microstructure of the ceramic particles sintering process has also influenced the other physicochemical properties of the hfcm the densification of the hfcm may not only affect the physical appearance of the membrane but it rather influencing the performance of the membrane in term of the mechanical strength and water permeability in this case of study the best sintering temperature was chosen at 1050 c that nearing the melting point of the natural clinoptilolite of around 1150 c 28 further enhanced the sintering temperature beyond the melting point of the clinoptilolite may not only form the defect structure of the fabricated membrane but rather change the physicochemical properties of the ceramic 33 3 1 2 physicochemical properties of the hfcm the mechanical strength of the hfcm sintered at different temperature was examined and depicted in fig 4 a from the correlation it can be clearly seen that the mechanical strength of the hfcm is mainly affected by the sintering temperature the mechanical strength of the hfcm was significantly increased upon the increment in the temperature apart from the microstructure maneuver the grain growth process plays an important role in the shaping of the membrane strength 34 the lowermost mechanical strength was attained by the hfcm sintered at the lowest temperature 900 c with the value of 10 27 mpa the highest mechanical strength of 63 54 mpa was achieved by the hfcm sintered at 1100 c although the mechanical strength of the hfcm was expected to further increase with the increment of the sintering temperature the produced hfcm sintered at 1150 c showed the contradiction trend due to the defect structures namely dead end pores and channels additionally the occurrence of this defect could eventually diminish the quality of the membrane apart from lowering the mechanical strength of the membrane this defect will result in the high flow of water through the membrane to which reducing the contact time between the adsorbate ammonia to that of adsorbent hfcm thus relegating the intake of the adsorbate 23 the water permeability profile of the produced hfcms was examined in determining the compatibility of the membrane to be used as an effective adsorptive membrane fig 4b shows the water permeability profile of the hfcm sintered at different temperature it can be obviously seen that the water permeability of the hfcm was significantly leveled off upon the heighten of the sintering temperature until one lowermost permeability value 228 25 l m2 h was obtained by hfcm sintered at 1050 c the main factor attributed to this finding was the particle compactness of the ceramic grain in the membrane structure it is believed that the loosely packed particle attained in the hfcm sintered at the lower temperature has low detention over water flow through the membrane 28 this could eventually reduce the residence time of the feed solution containing adsorbate ammonia with the adsorptive membrane the instant contact between the ammonia and the membrane will lower the possibility of adsorption process between these two species 23 further increase in the sintering temperature have eventually produced the membranes that has slightly higher water permeability this could be caused by the presence of defect structure of the membrane namely macro pores and channels 35 the presence of such defect will be eventually promoting the escapism of the ammonia from the hfcm consequently this occurrence could finally drop the adsorption performance of the hfcm of all the sintering temperature it was found that the hfcm sintered at 1050 c gives the lowest water permeation as compared to other temperature it is expected that the lowermost water permeation could be eventually resulting in the highest adsorption of the ammonia for the better adsorption process the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbed species plays the crucial role in the process the sufficient interaction of these two species can be attained via prolonged contact between adsorbent and the adsorbed ions this phenomenon is known as retention time 36 in the case of adsorptive membrane the longer contact of the membrane to that of adsorbed ions can only be possibly attained by the lower water permeability the enough retention time is obtained as the extended time achieved between the lowest permeability membrane has eventually provided sufficient reaction time of the adsorption process 23 therefore hfcm sintered at 1050 c was then chosen and subjected to the water permeability test at different water pressure fig 4c depicts the water permeability of the hfcm sintered at 1050 c tested at different feed water pressure from the line graph it could be seen that the water permeation of the hfcm was significantly increased upon the increment in the water pressure it can be clearly seen that the water permeation of hfcm was recorded at 228 25 l m2 h at 1 bar this value was profoundly increased over the increment of the pressure and the highest water permeation was obtained at 3 bars with 601 06 l m2 h the firmly compacted particles of the ceramic have detained the water molecules to passing through the membrane however at the higher pressure the water molecules are enforced to pass through the membrane structure 37 further enhanced of the water pressure would likely increase the water permeability of the membrane conclusively based on the micrograph of the hfcm and due to the compactness of the membrane the membrane sintered at 1050 c and above showed the most promising structures to be chosen as the best fabricated membrane in addition the membrane sintered at these temperatures have showed other promising properties namely high mechanical strength and lowermost water permeability that ensuring the best performance of the membrane the obtained value of mechanical strength achieved by the best fabricated membrane sintered at 1050 c is comparable to that of other ceramic membrane reported elsewhere 31 38 therefore this hfcm was chosen for the subsequent analyses including the performances of the ammonia removal test 3 1 3 crystallinity chemical composition and zeta potential properties of hfcm the sintering process plays an important role in determining the microstructure of the produced hfcm apart from controlling the microstructure of the produced membrane this process has also affecting the crystallinity and chemical composition of the hfcm from the microstructure in sem images three hfcms were chosen represented the lowermost 900 c best 1050 c and highest 1150 c sintering temperatures for the crystallinity and chemical composition analyses fig 5 a depicts the diffractogram of the hfcm sintered at different temperatures as well as the starting natural zeolite powder from the correlation the main phases consisted in all samples are quartz cristobalite and anorthoclase on the other hand the main composition of the natural zeolite was confirmed as clinoptilolite based upon the presence of major peaks of clinoptilolite 39 upon the sintering process the disappearance of the clinoptilolite peaks has been obviously seen the sintering process has eventually melting down and burnt off the major elements that composed the natural structure of the zeolite 40 the major transition of the zeolite phase upon the sintering process has been obviously seen as only silica based phase peaks namely quartz cristobalite and anorthoclase are remained in the patterns similar trend of findings has been reported in previous studies although different treatment has been done onto the zeolite samples 41 42 the changes in the phase of the membrane within the temperature range 900 1150 c was more pronounced as the sintering temperature increased the disappearance and shrinkage of the quartz peaks upon the increment of the sintering temperature can be significantly remarked from the diffractograms likewise the presence of cristobalite phase was more pronounced at the higher sintering temperature due to the increment in the intensity of the peaks this phenomenon has suggesting that the heat sintering process has significantly changes the crystallography properties of the zeolite membrane although the crystal phase of the zeolite particles has significantly changed over the sintering process the increment of the adsorption performance upon the sintering process is most likely due to the presence of non crystalline aluminosilicate compounds 32 the presence of this non crystalline aluminosilicate that possessed more open structures that corresponded to the ion exchange process in eliminating ammonia from the water 43 this claim has been supported and in good agreement to that of findings in xrf and zeta potential analyses to further confirm the chemical changes of the zeolite upon the sintering process the elemental analysis of the xrf was carried out the elemental composition of the natural zeolite prior the sintering process was compared to that of zeolite fabricated as the adsorptive membrane sintered at different temperature table 1 depicts the elemental composition of the natural zeolite and adsorptive hfcm sintered at different temperatures from the correlation it can be clearly seen that the sintering process has not significantly changed the chemical composition of the zeolite prior and post the sintering process the similar range of the elemental constituents of all samples has suggested that the heat treatment has not significantly chemically transformed the major constituents presented in the natural zeolite but rather eliminated the impurities that naturally contained in the sample the elimination of such impurities has eventually increased the ion exchange process of the zeolite driven by the major constituents of the zeolite this has further confirmed that the adsorption process of the ammonia towards the hfcm are mainly influenced by the ion exchange process of the aluminosilicate composition of the zeolite 44 similarly to the conventional adsorption process the performance is solely depending on the ph of the surrounding solution where the adsorption process has taken place fig 5b depicts the zeta potential of both natural zeolite powder and the best fabricated hfcm sintered at 1050 c at different ph values it can be clearly seen that both samples were negatively charged in all range of ph values the zeta potential of the zeolite was more pronounce upon the sintering process hfcm compared to the natural zeolite powder it is believed that the heat treatment has eventually eliminated the trace elements contained in the natural zeolite thus increased the potential and negative charge of the zeolite additionally the surface charge of both samples was profoundly increased in its negativity upon the increment in the ph until highest value was achieved at ph 7 despite changing the charge of the sample the higher degree of negativity would be expecting to increase the affinity of the sample to attract and adsorb the free moving nh4 ions in the feed solution the negatively charged surfaces can impart the driving force for the electrostatic interaction with the positively charged adsorbate 45 zeolite is known for its superior ion exchange properties this could be possibly attributed by the isomorphous substitution in the sheet of zeolite lattice 46 the replacement of the si4 by the al3 cations will be forming the negatively charged adsorption sites these unique sites will be neutralized by the counter ions such as na k mg2 and ca2 localized on the surface of the particle the newly charged surface will be then neutralized by the ions coming from the contact solution 47 apart from the structural isomorphous substitutions that attributing for the negatively charged particles the ph dependent charge normally related to the dissociation of the hydroxyl groups may plays an important roles in determining the charge of the adsorbent 48 in this present work hfcm derived from the natural zeolite is electronegative and saturated with exchangeable cations namely na k mg2 and ca2 and these cations are capable to be exchanged with the ammonium that contained in the feed solution therefore it is worth saying that the ion exchange properties owned by the hfcm can be related to its composition and structure and improved the removal efficiency of the ammonia 49 3 2 ammonia removal using adsorptive hfcm 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics instead of the adsorption behaviour analysis another data could be obtained from the adsorption study relating to the optimization of process adsorption kinetics analysis is necessitated in the determination of the equilibrium contact time for the adsorption process the main fundamental of this analysis is to predict the possible adsorption mechanism and rate controlling steps of the process by fitting the experimental data to the kinetic models the most widespread used kinetic models for the adsorption process are pseudo first and pseudo second order models the removal efficiency of ammonia by the hfcm as well as the hfcm adsorption capacity are depicted in fig 6 a and b the capacity and the ammonia removal efficiency were measured by the system run at 1 bar of water pressure the efficiency of the hfcm was increased along with the increment of contact time until the equilibrium reached at 120 min the rapid upsurge in the percentage of ammonia removal at the beginning of the experiment could be attributed by the occupation of the ammonia onto the plenty readily available adsorption sites at the hfcm the unoccupied adsorption sites presented at the starting of the experiment leads to a fast diffusion and rapid equilibrium accomplishment 50 the rate of removal efficiency was then leveled off and became plateau indicated that the equilibrium was approached and the membrane became saturated according to he et al 2016 when the rapid adsorption occurred at the exterior surface of the adsorbent until it reaches the saturation point the ammonia will enter the pores of the adsorbent and are adsorbed at the interior surface of the particles 51 therefore it has been widely proposed and reported that the rapid adsorption kinetics plays an eminent influence in the effectiveness and field utilization of adsorbents 52 the investigation of the adsorption behavior has been done using two kinetics models namely pseudo first order and pseudo second order models the linear equations of the models are as follows 30 pseudo first order 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t pseudo second order 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t h k 2 q e 2 where qt is adsorption capacity at time t mg g k1 and k2 are adsorption constants 1 min and g mg min respectively and h is the rate of adsorption mg g min the adsorption kinetics correlation of the ammonia by the hfcm is depicted in fig 6c and d the kinetics parameters of both fittings are k1 0 0298 min 1 and qe 13 3248 mg g for pseudo first order and h 0 3392 mg g min and qe 16 8294 mg g for pseudo second order models respectively from the correlation it can be seen that the experimental data is well fitted to the pseudo second order model with determination coefficient r2 value of 0 99475 as compared to the fitting of pseudo first order kinetics model r2 0 96768 the pseudo second order model was very appropriate in describing the adsorption behavior that composed of non chemical and non physical equilibriums 53 this model suggesting that tow reactions are occurring there are three steps involved in the adsorption kinetics i the diffusion of ammonia from liquid phase to liquid solid interphase ii the migration of the ammonia from liquid solid interface to solid surface and followed by iii the diffusion of ammonia into the particle pores 25 54 this model has suggested that the reaction can be fast and quickly reaches the equilibrium point at the first stage of the experiment and become slower and continue for a long time 55 additionally the initial rate of adsorption h is the most practical factor in determining the sorption rate the value obtained in this present work is compatible to those reported in the literature 53 additionally the obtained qe value obtained experimentally 12 468 mg g was comparable to that value obtained by the fitting process of this kinetic model 3 2 2 effect of feed solution ph it was commonly reported that ph condition of the feed has also plays a significant influence towards the adsorptivity performance of an adsorbent 10 similarly to the conventional adsorption process the performance is solely depending on the ph of the surrounding feed solution where the adsorption process has taken place fig 7 depicts the graph of hfcm performance at different ph in terms of ammonia removal and feed water permeability the results obtained indicated that the removal efficiency of the ammonia increases with the increment of ph from ph 2 to ph 7 and steadily declines towards ph 11 from the correlation it can be clearly seen that the ammonia removal was the highest achieved at ph 7 with 96 67 of rejection this could be due to the highest negative charge possessed by the hfcm at this ph the zeta potential analysis fig 4b has shown that the highest negative charge 37 5 mv was attained at ph 7 indicating that the adsorption of ammonia is highly favourable at this condition additionally the lower removal at the low ph could be explained by the low negative charge of the hfcm surface due to the excess presence of the h in the solution additionally the surface charge of the hfcm is ph dependent due to the effect of the degree of ionization of the ammonia 56 the high concentration of the h in the solution as the ph decreases has eventually intensifies the competition for the adsorption and exchange sites between this species to that of ammonia onto hfcm surface 57 at the higher ph the decrease behavior of the ammonia removal is possibly contributed by the fact that ammonia transformed into free aqueous ammonia 9 on the other hand the fluctuated water permeability in the range of 30 l m2 h indicated that all membranes were possessed the similar permeability thus signified that the membrane permeability has no significant effect in tailoring the ammonia removal performance therefore it is concluded that ph 7 is the best ph for the adsorption of ammonia onto the hfcm 4 conclusion the adsorption behavior of the adsorptive hfcm onto the ammonia has been investigated in this work the sintering temperature effect towards the physicochemical properties of the hfcm was studied and revealed that 1050 c was chosen as the best temperature that could produce the best performance membrane with 54 20 mpa and 228 25 l m2 h of mechanical strength and water permeability respectively the adsorption data showed that the contact time and initial ph of the ammonia feed solution have significantly affected the performance of the membrane towards the adsorption of the ammonia the kinetics study has shown that the adsorption was best fitted to pseudo second order kinetics model additionally the structure and surface properties of the hfcm characterized in this study have exposed that the ammonia adsorption capacity of the membrane could be mainly attributed by the ion exchange principle therefore this study suggests that the adsorptive hfcm derived from natural zeolite is capable of and can be considered as a supreme adsorbent for the ammoniacal wastewater treatment equipped with excellent water separation profile data availability statement the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms

14194,this work presented the adsorptive hollow fibre ceramic membrane hfcm derived from clinoptilolite for effective removal of ammonia from water the effect of different sintering temperature of hfcm 900 1150 c and ph of ammonia feed solution ph 2 ph 11 were examined the membranes were fully characterized by the scanning electron microscopy sem mechanical strength water permeability x ray diffraction xrd x ray fluorescence xrf and zeta potential to get the better understand of its physicochemical properties and ammonia adsorption mechanism relationship the best fabricated hfcm was produced when sintered at 1050 c with 54 20 mpa and 228 25 l m2 h of mechanical strength and water permeability respectively the adsorption kinetics behavior showed that the adsorption process was best fitted to pseudo second order kinetic model with 12 468 mg g adsorption capacity the morphology and negatively charged surface of the hfcm have significantly contributed to the high adsorption of the ammonia 96 67 from the feed solution the maximum adsorption activities were achieved at ph 7 with 0 4 g l hfcm within 120 min of residence time the results indicated that the adsorptive hfcm have significant potential to be developed as simple economical and effective remover for the ammoniacal wastewater treatment keywords clinoptilolite hollow fibre ceramic membrane hfcm adsorptive membrane ammonia removal 1 introduction ammonia is an essential compound that can be the basic need of the plant as the source of nutrient up to the wide potential application of the industrial namely the feedstock of nitrogen for the agriculture as well as the refrigerant 1 2 apart from the important notes of the ammonia in many applications the excessive presence of this compound may turn it into a toxic contaminant according to karasik 2002 an exposure of 30 min of 500 mg l of ammonia can causes irreversible effects whereas the exposure for 60 min of 3400 mg l of ammonia could be fatal to any living organism 3 on the other hand the excessive amount of ammonia could trigger the algal bloom and thus lead to the eutrophication phenomenon of the aquatic ecosystem 4 the consequence of this phenomena including undesirable disturbance to the organisms balance as well as depletion of the water quality concerned the elimination of the ammoniacal contaminant has become the major concern for the past few decades many approaches have been attempted in removing this toxic material from the water bodies including air stripping biological treatment nitrification denitrification ion exchange etc 5 8 the efficiency of removal processes of biological treatment nitrification denitrification and air stripping is significantly influenced by the surrounding and notably impaired by the low temperature during winter as well as cost consuming due to the complicated treatment process 9 therefore it was found that ion exchange has remarkably shows the promising ammonia removal of all the available methods 10 one of the excellent ion exchanger that has high affinity towards ammonium ion is natural zeolite 11 natural zeolite with porous structure possesses valuable physicochemical properties comprising high void volume for bigger surface area influential cation selectivity and high cation exchange capacity 12 of all the natural zeolites clinoptilolite has been widely used and reported in removing ammonia from water 13 14 clinoptilolite is also known as one of the ion exchangers with a high affinity for ammonium ion clinoptilolite shows a classical aluminosilicate structure and hence possesses important macroporosity naturally the cations appear on clinoptilolite are sodium potassium and calcium the selectivity order of natural zeolite among cations shows that ammonium ion is one of the highest selected cations toward zeolite 11 therefore it is strongly believed that natural zeolite has an ability in the removal of ammonia from the solution concerning adsorption and ion exchange feature the capability of these zeolites in removing the ammonia lies in the range of 2 7 mg g to 30 6 mg g of adsorption capacities 14 15 however these adsorption approaches of powder suspension for the ammonia uptake was inconvenient due to secondary treatment requirement namely filtration upon the adsorption process has taken place this filtration process has eventually resulting in the loss of adsorbent during the process and the possibility of adsorbent leachate to the filtrate solution these weaknesses have eventually depreciating the good reputation of this technique recently adsorptive membranes which combines the advantages of membrane technology and adsorption process have become as an effective way to remove contaminant ions from aqueous solutions hence the contaminant ions can be removed from aqueous solutions when the metal ions in the solutions are in contact with the surfaces of the membranes even though the pore sizes of the membranes may be much larger than the dimensions of the metal ions 16 in comparison with the conventional microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes the adsorptive membranes provide the advantages of high retaining efficiency for contaminant ions together with the benefits of low energy consumption and high permeate flux 17 with the application of such adsorptive membranes the function of the membrane process can be expanded from filtration solely to the hybrid process of filtration adsorption which might lead to synergistic effect to date most of the adsorptive membranes are composed of polymer type membranes either natural or synthetic polymers embedded with the adsorbent 18 19 a study was reported on the fabrication of mixed matrix membrane from natural zeolite that was incorporated into the polyether sulfone polymer matrix 20 the membrane demonstrated high capacity and high stability towards ammonium in wastewater this mixed matrix adsorptive membrane may suffer from few limitations the impregnation of the adsorbent onto the host polymer membrane may reduce the surface area of the adsorbent to which plays the most important role in the adsorption effectiveness additionally the regeneration process of the saturated adsorptive membrane may lead to the leaching of the adsorbent from the polymer matrix in general there are few articles reported on the utilization of the clinoptilolite as the adsorptive membrane and none of its kind to be focused on the development of the ceramic adsorptive membrane for the adsorption of ammonia in water the previously reported study was focusing on the utilization of the clinoptilolite based adsorptive membrane for the removal of chromium vi from the water 21 on the contrary this study aims for the fabrication of the adsorptive hollow fibre ceramic membrane hfcm derived from clinoptilolite specifically for the ammonia removal in wastewater additionally the performance of ammonia removal via adsorption using this membrane was experimented at various ph of the ammonia feed solution conditions thus evaluating the interaction between the adsorptive hfcm to the adsorbed ammonia the hfcm fabrication parameter of different sintering temperature towards the physicochemical properties of the membrane was examined in this study the appropriate sintering temperature is crucial to produce the membrane with right membrane morphology that eventually contributed to the best water permeability 22 this will eventually determine the efficacy of the produced membrane in the ammonia removal via adsorption process which attributed by the optimum residence time adsorption contact time that is achievable by the membrane with the best water permeability 23 the study of such parameters is a new sight and perspective in developing the adsorptive membrane technology moreover most of the reported adsorption studies are mainly in the form of conventional powder suspension adsorbent to which requires the improvisations in their performances due to many limitations 24 25 additionally the adsorption kinetics of the membrane has also investigated in this study 2 experimental 2 1 materials the starting materials of natural zeolite clinoptilolite powder with average particle size of 70 Œºm was purchased from liaoning province china shijiazhuang mining trade co

as polymer binder solvent and dispersant respectively 25 ammonia solution ar grade qrec merck germany was used to prepare the synthetic ammoniacal wastewater in membrane performance study 2 2 adsorptive membrane preparation the adsorptive clinoptilolite based hfcm was prepared by phase inversion based extrusion sintering technique using the composition as reported in the previous study 21 firstly the dispersant arlacel p135 was dissolved in nmp under vigorous stirring once a homogeneous solution was formed the ground sieved and pre dried zeolite powder of 36 Œºm was slowly added into the solution based upon the weight ratio 45 wt and the suspension was subsequently subjected to ball milling using nqm 2 planetary ball mill after 48 h of milling pesf of the desired weight was added into the dope and milling continued for another 48 h the resulted suspension was then degassed for 30 min at room temperature to eliminate the air bubbles after degassing the dope suspension was introduced into a syringe pump phd 2000 harvard apparatus usa and extruded through a tube in orifice spinneret with specified diameter of inner contour of 0 5 mm and outer diameter of 2 8 mm using extrusion parameter of 10 ml min for dope suspension extrusion rate 15 ml min of bore fluid flowrate and 5 cm of air gap distance tap water was used as the internal coagulant after travelling a certain air gap distance the fibre membrane green bodies were immersed in a water coagulant bath for 24 h to allow the completion of the phase inversion process afterwards they were dried at room temperature for 24 h finally the fibre precursors were sintered in tubular furnace xy 1700 magna protech china under air environment for 4 h at various targeted temperatures in the range of 900 1150 c the heating rate was 2 c min throughout the heating and cooling process of sintering the fabrication of the zeolite based hfcm was exactly followed the steps done in previous study with slightly modification that involving the ceramic composition loading and the grade of the ceramic particle size 26 2 3 characterization of hfcm the scanning electron microscope sem was used to examine the morphological behavior of the hfcm prior to the morphological analysis using the sem hitachi model tm 3000 japan the sample of hfcm was gold coated and sputtered with gold for 3 min under the vacuum condition these analyses consisted of cross sectional anatomy of the membranes the x ray diffraction xrd analysis was examined using xrd bruker axs d8 germany with cu kŒ± radiation Œª 1 5406 «ª the elemental composition of the natural zeolite raw powder and hfcm sintered at different temperature was investigated using x ray fluorescence xrf axios sequential wd xrf panalytical 2005 netherlands the mechanical strength of the membrane was measured using three point bending machine instron model 3342 usa the flexural strength of the membrane was calculated using the following equation 27 1 œÉ

respectively the water permeation flux f l m2 h was calculated using eq 2 where v a and t are the volume of the permeate l membrane area m2 and time h respectively 28 2 f v a t 2 4 adsorptive membrane performance the ammonia removal performance of the hfcm via adsorption process was done using the dead end water permeation setup with 50 mg l of synthetic ammonia wastewater at 25 c the feed solution was prepared by diluting 25 ammonia stock solution to 40 mg l with ph 10 without modification upon preparation the ph was kept high due to a report stated that increasing the ph value of the feed will eventually promote the removal of ammonia 29 the feed solution was passed through the dead end epoxy coated adsorptive hfcm with a crossflow setup module dimension of 10 cm with 2 cm in diameter as shown in fig 1 the experiment was run at ambient room temperature of 27 c throughout the adsorption process the ammonia content of both feed and permeate solutions for each analysis was determine using uv vis spectrophotometry analysis hach model dr 5000 canada with the aid of ammoniacal reagent kit containing of ammonium salicylate and ammonium cyanurate as the colour indicator for the ammonia content the colour intensities was measured in the mode of absorbance and translated into the ammonia content upon the comparison to that of calibration curve prepared prior of the uv vis analyses the ammonia removal performance was calculated using the following equation 21 3 r c f c p c f 100 where cf and cp are the ammonia concentration mg l in the feed and permeate respectively 2 4 1 adsorption kinetics the optimum time taken for the ammonia adsorption to attain equilibrium was determined as a function of contact time the amount of the hfcm used was fixed at 0 4 g l with effective area of 6 195 10 4 m2 and the contact time was studied in the range of 5 180 min of 100 ml of 50 mg l ammonia solution at fixed ph 7 and 25 c the adsorption capacity of the hfcm was calculated using the following equation 30 4 q e c f c e v m where cf and ce are the ammonia feed concentration and equilibrium ammonia concentration mg l v is the volume of the permeate solution l

in the range of ph 2 11 of 50 mg l ammonia solution for 3 h the feed initial ph was adjusted by 1 m naoh or hcl solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of hfcm sintered at different temperatures 3 1 1 physicochemical behavior the sem micrographs of the cross sectional hfcm are depicted in fig 2 the sem micrograph indicates that the grain growth of the ceramic has been occurred upon the sintering process has taken place fig 3 illustrates the grain growth process of ceramic particle during the sintering process the micrographs shown in fig 2 have also showed that the densification of the hfcm is remarkably obvious along with the increment in sintering temperature this phenomenon is more profound in the cross sectional images as the ceramic particles were found merging to one another and thus the bigger grains were formed at higher temperature additionally the densified membrane sintered at higher temperature possessed the formation of bigger void resulting from the interparticle space left after the grain growing process these voids will eventually form the dead end pores and or tunnels across the membrane this defect structures will be affecting the physicochemical properties of the membrane and thus reducing its adsorption performance in the adsorptive membrane process the fast permeation of the water can be due to the loosely packed ceramic particles or due to the defect structure of the membrane the fast permeation will lead to the shorter residence time to which eventually provided insufficient time for the adsorption to be occurred 23 additionally the void structures can lead to the escapism of the ammonia from undergoing the adsorption process similar findings on the effect of sintering temperature on the physiochemical properties of the ceramic membrane have been reported in several studies 21 31 32 apart from the microstructure of the membrane the increment of the sintering temperature has also influenced the membrane physical appearance it was found that the membrane thickness has significantly decreased upon the escalation of the sintering temperature from 189 Œºm for hfcm sintered at 900 c to 148 Œºm for the hfcm sintered at 1150 c this phenomenon could be attributable by the densification of the ceramic particles within the membrane 33 these densified membranes are composed of closely packed grains and thus the thinning process the membrane could profoundly observed the reduction of the membrane thickness can be seen from fig 2a2 to fig 2f2 additionally the consideration of the material selection prior the sintering process should be taken into account the best sintering temperature normally approaching the melting point of the ceramic material used for the fabrication of the ceramic membrane apart from the determination of the microstructure of the ceramic particles sintering process has also influenced the other physicochemical properties of the hfcm the densification of the hfcm may not only affect the physical appearance of the membrane but it rather influencing the performance of the membrane in term of the mechanical strength and water permeability in this case of study the best sintering temperature was chosen at 1050 c that nearing the melting point of the natural clinoptilolite of around 1150 c 28 further enhanced the sintering temperature beyond the melting point of the clinoptilolite may not only form the defect structure of the fabricated membrane but rather change the physicochemical properties of the ceramic 33 3 1 2 physicochemical properties of the hfcm the mechanical strength of the hfcm sintered at different temperature was examined and depicted in fig 4 a from the correlation it can be clearly seen that the mechanical strength of the hfcm is mainly affected by the sintering temperature the mechanical strength of the hfcm was significantly increased upon the increment in the temperature apart from the microstructure maneuver the grain growth process plays an important role in the shaping of the membrane strength 34 the lowermost mechanical strength was attained by the hfcm sintered at the lowest temperature 900 c with the value of 10 27 mpa the highest mechanical strength of 63 54 mpa was achieved by the hfcm sintered at 1100 c although the mechanical strength of the hfcm was expected to further increase with the increment of the sintering temperature the produced hfcm sintered at 1150 c showed the contradiction trend due to the defect structures namely dead end pores and channels additionally the occurrence of this defect could eventually diminish the quality of the membrane apart from lowering the mechanical strength of the membrane this defect will result in the high flow of water through the membrane to which reducing the contact time between the adsorbate ammonia to that of adsorbent hfcm thus relegating the intake of the adsorbate 23 the water permeability profile of the produced hfcms was examined in determining the compatibility of the membrane to be used as an effective adsorptive membrane fig 4b shows the water permeability profile of the hfcm sintered at different temperature it can be obviously seen that the water permeability of the hfcm was significantly leveled off upon the heighten of the sintering temperature until one lowermost permeability value 228 25 l m2 h was obtained by hfcm sintered at 1050 c the main factor attributed to this finding was the particle compactness of the ceramic grain in the membrane structure it is believed that the loosely packed particle attained in the hfcm sintered at the lower temperature has low detention over water flow through the membrane 28 this could eventually reduce the residence time of the feed solution containing adsorbate ammonia with the adsorptive membrane the instant contact between the ammonia and the membrane will lower the possibility of adsorption process between these two species 23 further increase in the sintering temperature have eventually produced the membranes that has slightly higher water permeability this could be caused by the presence of defect structure of the membrane namely macro pores and channels 35 the presence of such defect will be eventually promoting the escapism of the ammonia from the hfcm consequently this occurrence could finally drop the adsorption performance of the hfcm of all the sintering temperature it was found that the hfcm sintered at 1050 c gives the lowest water permeation as compared to other temperature it is expected that the lowermost water permeation could be eventually resulting in the highest adsorption of the ammonia for the better adsorption process the interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbed species plays the crucial role in the process the sufficient interaction of these two species can be attained via prolonged contact between adsorbent and the adsorbed ions this phenomenon is known as retention time 36 in the case of adsorptive membrane the longer contact of the membrane to that of adsorbed ions can only be possibly attained by the lower water permeability the enough retention time is obtained as the extended time achieved between the lowest permeability membrane has eventually provided sufficient reaction time of the adsorption process 23 therefore hfcm sintered at 1050 c was then chosen and subjected to the water permeability test at different water pressure fig 4c depicts the water permeability of the hfcm sintered at 1050 c tested at different feed water pressure from the line graph it could be seen that the water permeation of the hfcm was significantly increased upon the increment in the water pressure it can be clearly seen that the water permeation of hfcm was recorded at 228 25 l m2 h at 1 bar this value was profoundly increased over the increment of the pressure and the highest water permeation was obtained at 3 bars with 601 06 l m2 h the firmly compacted particles of the ceramic have detained the water molecules to passing through the membrane however at the higher pressure the water molecules are enforced to pass through the membrane structure 37 further enhanced of the water pressure would likely increase the water permeability of the membrane conclusively based on the micrograph of the hfcm and due to the compactness of the membrane the membrane sintered at 1050 c and above showed the most promising structures to be chosen as the best fabricated membrane in addition the membrane sintered at these temperatures have showed other promising properties namely high mechanical strength and lowermost water permeability that ensuring the best performance of the membrane the obtained value of mechanical strength achieved by the best fabricated membrane sintered at 1050 c is comparable to that of other ceramic membrane reported elsewhere 31 38 therefore this hfcm was chosen for the subsequent analyses including the performances of the ammonia removal test 3 1 3 crystallinity chemical composition and zeta potential properties of hfcm the sintering process plays an important role in determining the microstructure of the produced hfcm apart from controlling the microstructure of the produced membrane this process has also affecting the crystallinity and chemical composition of the hfcm from the microstructure in sem images three hfcms were chosen represented the lowermost 900 c best 1050 c and highest 1150 c sintering temperatures for the crystallinity and chemical composition analyses fig 5 a depicts the diffractogram of the hfcm sintered at different temperatures as well as the starting natural zeolite powder from the correlation the main phases consisted in all samples are quartz cristobalite and anorthoclase on the other hand the main composition of the natural zeolite was confirmed as clinoptilolite based upon the presence of major peaks of clinoptilolite 39 upon the sintering process the disappearance of the clinoptilolite peaks has been obviously seen the sintering process has eventually melting down and burnt off the major elements that composed the natural structure of the zeolite 40 the major transition of the zeolite phase upon the sintering process has been obviously seen as only silica based phase peaks namely quartz cristobalite and anorthoclase are remained in the patterns similar trend of findings has been reported in previous studies although different treatment has been done onto the zeolite samples 41 42 the changes in the phase of the membrane within the temperature range 900 1150 c was more pronounced as the sintering temperature increased the disappearance and shrinkage of the quartz peaks upon the increment of the sintering temperature can be significantly remarked from the diffractograms likewise the presence of cristobalite phase was more pronounced at the higher sintering temperature due to the increment in the intensity of the peaks this phenomenon has suggesting that the heat sintering process has significantly changes the crystallography properties of the zeolite membrane although the crystal phase of the zeolite particles has significantly changed over the sintering process the increment of the adsorption performance upon the sintering process is most likely due to the presence of non crystalline aluminosilicate compounds 32 the presence of this non crystalline aluminosilicate that possessed more open structures that corresponded to the ion exchange process in eliminating ammonia from the water 43 this claim has been supported and in good agreement to that of findings in xrf and zeta potential analyses to further confirm the chemical changes of the zeolite upon the sintering process the elemental analysis of the xrf was carried out the elemental composition of the natural zeolite prior the sintering process was compared to that of zeolite fabricated as the adsorptive membrane sintered at different temperature table 1 depicts the elemental composition of the natural zeolite and adsorptive hfcm sintered at different temperatures from the correlation it can be clearly seen that the sintering process has not significantly changed the chemical composition of the zeolite prior and post the sintering process the similar range of the elemental constituents of all samples has suggested that the heat treatment has not significantly chemically transformed the major constituents presented in the natural zeolite but rather eliminated the impurities that naturally contained in the sample the elimination of such impurities has eventually increased the ion exchange process of the zeolite driven by the major constituents of the zeolite this has further confirmed that the adsorption process of the ammonia towards the hfcm are mainly influenced by the ion exchange process of the aluminosilicate composition of the zeolite 44 similarly to the conventional adsorption process the performance is solely depending on the ph of the surrounding solution where the adsorption process has taken place fig 5b depicts the zeta potential of both natural zeolite powder and the best fabricated hfcm sintered at 1050 c at different ph values it can be clearly seen that both samples were negatively charged in all range of ph values the zeta potential of the zeolite was more pronounce upon the sintering process hfcm compared to the natural zeolite powder it is believed that the heat treatment has eventually eliminated the trace elements contained in the natural zeolite thus increased the potential and negative charge of the zeolite additionally the surface charge of both samples was profoundly increased in its negativity upon the increment in the ph until highest value was achieved at ph 7 despite changing the charge of the sample the higher degree of negativity would be expecting to increase the affinity of the sample to attract and adsorb the free moving nh4 ions in the feed solution the negatively charged surfaces can impart the driving force for the electrostatic interaction with the positively charged adsorbate 45 zeolite is known for its superior ion exchange properties this could be possibly attributed by the isomorphous substitution in the sheet of zeolite lattice 46 the replacement of the si4 by the al3 cations will be forming the negatively charged adsorption sites these unique sites will be neutralized by the counter ions such as na k mg2 and ca2 localized on the surface of the particle the newly charged surface will be then neutralized by the ions coming from the contact solution 47 apart from the structural isomorphous substitutions that attributing for the negatively charged particles the ph dependent charge normally related to the dissociation of the hydroxyl groups may plays an important roles in determining the charge of the adsorbent 48 in this present work hfcm derived from the natural zeolite is electronegative and saturated with exchangeable cations namely na k mg2 and ca2 and these cations are capable to be exchanged with the ammonium that contained in the feed solution therefore it is worth saying that the ion exchange properties owned by the hfcm can be related to its composition and structure and improved the removal efficiency of the ammonia 49 3 2 ammonia removal using adsorptive hfcm 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics instead of the adsorption behaviour analysis another data could be obtained from the adsorption study relating to the optimization of process adsorption kinetics analysis is necessitated in the determination of the equilibrium contact time for the adsorption process the main fundamental of this analysis is to predict the possible adsorption mechanism and rate controlling steps of the process by fitting the experimental data to the kinetic models the most widespread used kinetic models for the adsorption process are pseudo first and pseudo second order models the removal efficiency of ammonia by the hfcm as well as the hfcm adsorption capacity are depicted in fig 6 a and b the capacity and the ammonia removal efficiency were measured by the system run at 1 bar of water pressure the efficiency of the hfcm was increased along with the increment of contact time until the equilibrium reached at 120 min the rapid upsurge in the percentage of ammonia removal at the beginning of the experiment could be attributed by the occupation of the ammonia onto the plenty readily available adsorption sites at the hfcm the unoccupied adsorption sites presented at the starting of the experiment leads to a fast diffusion and rapid equilibrium accomplishment 50 the rate of removal efficiency was then leveled off and became plateau indicated that the equilibrium was approached and the membrane became saturated according to he et al 2016 when the rapid adsorption occurred at the exterior surface of the adsorbent until it reaches the saturation point the ammonia will enter the pores of the adsorbent and are adsorbed at the interior surface of the particles 51 therefore it has been widely proposed and reported that the rapid adsorption kinetics plays an eminent influence in the effectiveness and field utilization of adsorbents 52 the investigation of the adsorption behavior has been done using two kinetics models namely pseudo first order and pseudo second order models the linear equations of the models are as follows 30 pseudo first order 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t pseudo second order 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t h k 2 q e 2 where qt is adsorption capacity at time t mg g k1 and k2 are adsorption constants 1 min and g mg min respectively and h is the rate of adsorption mg g min the adsorption kinetics correlation of the ammonia by the hfcm is depicted in fig 6c and d the kinetics parameters of both fittings are k1 0 0298 min 1 and qe 13 3248 mg g for pseudo first order and h 0 3392 mg g min and qe 16 8294 mg g for pseudo second order models respectively from the correlation it can be seen that the experimental data is well fitted to the pseudo second order model with determination coefficient r2 value of 0 99475 as compared to the fitting of pseudo first order kinetics model r2 0 96768 the pseudo second order model was very appropriate in describing the adsorption behavior that composed of non chemical and non physical equilibriums 53 this model suggesting that tow reactions are occurring there are three steps involved in the adsorption kinetics i the diffusion of ammonia from liquid phase to liquid solid interphase ii the migration of the ammonia from liquid solid interface to solid surface and followed by iii the diffusion of ammonia into the particle pores 25 54 this model has suggested that the reaction can be fast and quickly reaches the equilibrium point at the first stage of the experiment and become slower and continue for a long time 55 additionally the initial rate of adsorption h is the most practical factor in determining the sorption rate the value obtained in this present work is compatible to those reported in the literature 53 additionally the obtained qe value obtained experimentally 12 468 mg g was comparable to that value obtained by the fitting process of this kinetic model 3 2 2 effect of feed solution ph it was commonly reported that ph condition of the feed has also plays a significant influence towards the adsorptivity performance of an adsorbent 10 similarly to the conventional adsorption process the performance is solely depending on the ph of the surrounding feed solution where the adsorption process has taken place fig 7 depicts the graph of hfcm performance at different ph in terms of ammonia removal and feed water permeability the results obtained indicated that the removal efficiency of the ammonia increases with the increment of ph from ph 2 to ph 7 and steadily declines towards ph 11 from the correlation it can be clearly seen that the ammonia removal was the highest achieved at ph 7 with 96 67 of rejection this could be due to the highest negative charge possessed by the hfcm at this ph the zeta potential analysis fig 4b has shown that the highest negative charge 37 5 mv was attained at ph 7 indicating that the adsorption of ammonia is highly favourable at this condition additionally the lower removal at the low ph could be explained by the low negative charge of the hfcm surface due to the excess presence of the h in the solution additionally the surface charge of the hfcm is ph dependent due to the effect of the degree of ionization of the ammonia 56 the high concentration of the h in the solution as the ph decreases has eventually intensifies the competition for the adsorption and exchange sites between this species to that of ammonia onto hfcm surface 57 at the higher ph the decrease behavior of the ammonia removal is possibly contributed by the fact that ammonia transformed into free aqueous ammonia 9 on the other hand the fluctuated water permeability in the range of 30 l m2 h indicated that all membranes were possessed the similar permeability thus signified that the membrane permeability has no significant effect in tailoring the ammonia removal performance therefore it is concluded that ph 7 is the best ph for the adsorption of ammonia onto the hfcm 4 conclusion the adsorption behavior of the adsorptive hfcm onto the ammonia has been investigated in this work the sintering temperature effect towards the physicochemical properties of the hfcm was studied and revealed that 1050 c was chosen as the best temperature that could produce the best performance membrane with 54 20 mpa and 228 25 l m2 h of mechanical strength and water permeability respectively the adsorption data showed that the contact time and initial ph of the ammonia feed solution have significantly affected the performance of the membrane towards the adsorption of the ammonia the kinetics study has shown that the adsorption was best fitted to pseudo second order kinetics model additionally the structure and surface properties of the hfcm characterized in this study have exposed that the ammonia adsorption capacity of the membrane could be mainly attributed by the ion exchange principle therefore this study suggests that the adsorptive hfcm derived from natural zeolite is capable of and can be considered as a supreme adsorbent for the ammoniacal wastewater treatment equipped with excellent water separation profile data availability statement the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms
