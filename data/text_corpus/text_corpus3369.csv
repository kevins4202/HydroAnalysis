16845,acid mine drainage amd generated in the active and abandoned mine sites is characterized by low ph and high metal concentrations one amd treatment possibility is biologically oxidizing fe2 followed by precipitation through ph control as compared to autotrophic iron oxidizing microbial community a microbial community enriched in the presence of organic nutrients was hypothesized to yield higher biomass during commissioning the bioreactor in this study the treatment of fe cu co mn zn ni and as containing simulated amd was studied using an iron oxidizing ceramic membrane bioreactor cmbr at varying hydraulic retention times hrts 6 24 h and two different feed fe2 concentrations 250 and 750 mg l the impact of tryptone soya broth tsb on the cmbr performance was also investigated almost complete fe2 oxidation and sustainable flux at around 5 0 l m2 h were obtained in the cmbr with the alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum dominated enrichment culture the fe2 oxidation rate as assessed in batch operation cycles of cmbr increased significantly with increasing fe2 loading to the bioreactor the iron oxidation rate decreased by the elimination of organic matter from the feed the increase of the cmbr permeate ph to 3 5 4 0 resulted in selective co precipitation of as and fe over 99 with the generation of biogenic schwertmannite keywords iron oxidation acid mine drainage arsenic removal schwertmannite ceramic membrane bioreactor alicyclobacillus tolerans 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd generated during the mining operations degrades the environment for long term durations the dissolution of the sulfide bearing metallic wastes is hazardous to adjacent water resources natarajan 2008 the main sources of amd are waste tailings underground and open cast mines stockpiles and spent heap leach dumps natarajan 2008 among the metal sulfides pyrite fes2 is the main mineral responsible for the amd generation as its bio oxidation may be quite fast when exposed to water and air kefeni et al 2017 amd causes severe environmental problems due to its low ph high concentration of toxic heavy metals metalloids and sulfate aytar et al 2015 blodau 2006 kefeni et al 2017 ferrous iron is bio oxidized to ferric iron forming iron oxide precipitates known as a yellow boy reactions 1 3 kefeni et al 2017 in general acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and acidithiobacillus thiooxidans are responsible for generating amd natarajan 2008 r 1 fes2 7 2o2 h2o fe2 2so4 2 2h r 2 fe2 ¼ o2 h fe3 ½ h2o r 3 fe3 3h2o fe oh 3 3h the overall reaction may be summarized

bioprocesses can also be used for amd treatment demir et al 2020 rowe and johnson 2008 for this purpose many types of bioreactors have been used including fluidized bed reactors fbr ozkaya et al 2007 biological jarosite carrier based biofilms ahoranta et al 2020 packed bed bioreactors rowe and johnson 2008 a modular continuous flow bioreactor hedrich and johnson 2012 serially connected tank reactors filled with suspended biofilm carriers sandström and mattsson 2001 and even membrane bioreactors demir et al 2020 park et al 2005 conventional active chemical treatment e g lime addition aeration and precipitation of metal hydroxides at ph 7 8 5 may have generate voluminous and poorly settleable sludge hedrich and johnson 2012 and result in high operational costs associated with high dosages of chemicals amd contains iron arsenic and many other precious heavy metals i e cu and zn hence the removal of non precious iron together with toxic arsenic ahoranta et al 2016 may increase the possibility of recovering precious heavy metals from amd and decreases the treatment and sludge handling cost in this context hedrich johnson 2012 used a modular continuous bioreactor system for iron oxidation in the first reactor inoculated with autotrophic ferrovum myxofaciens selective iron precipitation as schwertmannite at ph 3 5 in the second reactor and a third packed bed polishing bioreactor after which soluble iron decreased to 1 mg l the modular system selectively removed iron from a synthetic amd containing al cu mn and zn in another study ahoranta et al 2016 investigated iron oxidation in an fbr and simultaneous removal of ferric iron and arsenic in a gravity settler connected to the fbr they achieved high fe2 5 g l oxidation and as iii 10 mg l removals 99 at ph 3 0 due to adsorption and co precipitation with biogenic jarosite selective arsenic and iron separation from valuable metal solution during bioleaching has also been reported wakeman et al 2011 amd treatment researches have focused on uses of autotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria such as acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans however many heterotrophic and mixotrophic bacteria oxidize ferrous iron rowe and johnson 2008 high efficiency of iron oxidation depends on the quantity of bacteria retained in the bioreactor however reaching high quantity of autotrophic iron oxidizers may be slow due to low energy gain from the oxidation of iron rowe and johnson 2008 especially at low concentrations hence the use of organic nutrient supplementation may be advantageous especially during the initial commissioning of the bioprocess due to higher growth yield of heterotrophs mixotrophs compared to autotrophic counterparts demir et al 2020 rowe and johnson 2008 several studies have reported the use of biofilm reactors for iron oxidation ahoranta et al 2020 özkaya et al 2007 sandström and mattsson 2001 whilst membrane bioreactors mbrs to retain iron oxidizing acidophiles have rarely been used demir et al 2020 park et al 2005 some microorganisms may not attach to the media present in biofilm reactors hence the process performance may completely depend on the attachment performance of the culture on the selected media also it may be difficult to aerate and achieve proper hydraulic conditions in some biofilm reactors hence mbrs which have deserved significant attention in recent years for wastewater treatment huang and lee 2015 may also be used as an alternative to biofilm reactors for iron oxidation in our previous study demir et al 2020 efficiency of ceramic mbr cmbr for iron oxidation in the presence of an organic compound was demonstrated however the presence of metals often encountered in amd e g cu co mn zn ni and as on the process performance has not been investigated this study aims at investigating the performance of a cmbr at varying hydraulic retention times hrts and membrane fluxes for iron oxidation in a synthetic containing fe cu co mn zn ni and as amd the cmbr performance was also tested in the presence and absence of an organic matter further dynamic changes of bacterial community in the cmbr was investigated also the selective precipitation of iron and arsenic in the cmbr permeate as schwertmannite at phs 3 0 4 0 was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceramic membrane bioreactor and the composition of synthetic amd the cmbr was operated previously demir et al 2020 in the presence of ferrous iron 1400 mg l and tryptone soya broth tsb 250 mg l at ph 1 5 2 5 for 205 days the details about the bioreactor were presented in demir et al 2020 briefly the bioreactor had a total and working volumes of 4 7 l and 3 0 l respectively the pore size of the ceramic flat sheet membrane cembrane was 0 1 µm and the total filtration area of a module was 0 049 m2 an intermittent suction of 5 min on and 1 min relaxation cycles were adopted to decrease the cake formation on the membrane the bioreactor was continuously aerated to keep dissolved oxygen 3 mg l and scour the cake deposited on the membrane the bioreactor was operated without any temperature control at 27 1 6 c the cmbr operated in our previous study for 205 days demir et al 2020 was dominated by acidiphilium cryptum and alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus in the present study fe2 oxidation performance of the cmbr was evaluated in the presence of other heavy metals cu co mn zn and ni and as possibly found in amd table 1 synthetic wastewater was prepared with tap water whose ph value was adjusted to 2 0 using concentrated h2so4 nutrients and the metals prepared as 100 times concentrated solutions were supplemented to reach desired concentrations provided in table 1 h2asko4 was used in the preparation of as v stock solution the synthetic amd was also supplemented with 250 mg l tsb as an organic carbon and nutrient source to support biomass growth when the bioreactor was fed with tsb free media period 6 table 2 22 mg l kh2po4 was added as a p source for bacterial growth in the beginning the cmbr was fed with metal free media period 1 table 2 to evaluate the fe2 oxidation performance in the absence of high heavy metal concentrations metals at low concentrations were supplemented as nutrients table 1 after period 1 metals provided as a separate column in table 1 were added to the nutrient supplemented media to simulate amd 2 2 operational conditions of the ceramic membrane bioreactor the cmbr was operated under varying operational conditions table 2 in the first period table 2 the bioreactor was fed with 250 mg l fe2 in the absence of metal mixture at an hrt of 24 h in the 2nd period the metal mixture was added to the feed and the bioreactor performance was evaluated under varying hrts and fluxes in the 3rd and the 4th periods hrt was decreased to 12 h and 6 h respectively keeping the influent fe2 concentration at 250 mg l in the 5th period feed fe2 concentration was increased to 750 mg l to evaluated the bioreactor performance under increasing fe2 loading lastly in the 6th period tsb was eliminated from the synthetic feed the fe2 loading rate in the cmbr was changed between 0 25 and 3 0 g l d by varying the feed fe2 or hrt at the end of each period continuous operation of the cmbr was ceased and a concentrated fe2 solution was directly added to the cmbr the cmbr was then operated batch wise under aeration and the reactor was sampled to evaluate the time course variation of fe2 orp and ph the batch operations were continued until the orp values reached the ones recorded during the continuous operation i e orp 600 mv in this way the impacts of operational conditions table 2 on the fe2 oxidation rates were also evaluated under batch cycles of cmbr similar to our previous study demir et al 2020 membrane fouling was monitored by the transmembrane pressure tmp measurements the fluxes in the cmbr were changed between 2 55 and 10 2 lmh depending on the hrt and the numbers of membrane modules table 2 when tmp exceeds around 400 mbar a permeate backwash was provided to scour the cake gel layer on the membrane only one chemical cleaning was applied on day 90 in a 1 m h2so4 solution first and then in a 1 naocl solution for 1 day on day 99 periodic backwash cycles were started to alleviate membrane fouling the membranes were back washed with permeate at 30 lmh flux for 1 min durations every three hours of operation in period 5 the cmbr content was also sampled for the measurement of specific resistance to filtration srf supernatant filterability sf capillary suction time cst and viscosity 2 3 evaluating the impact of tsb and fe2 concentration in batch tests first of all a 1 l batch reactor was set up with a 10 ml sludge obtained from the cmbr on day 66 and the batch reactor was fed with initial tsb and fe2 concentrations of 250 mg l each the reactor was fed with the same concentrated solution three cycles to acclimate the biomass to batch operation then three parallel 1 l batch reactors were operated to evaluate the impacts of fe2 and tsb concentrations on the fe2 oxidation rate and biomass growth the initial tsb concentrations in all the parallels were 25 mg l and the initial phs were adjusted to around 2 0 using sulfuric acid all the reactors were seeded with 250 ml sludge obtained from the batch reactor described above in this way biomass already acclimated to batch conditions were used the first batch reactor br 1 was operated in the absence of fe2 whereas in the second br 2 and the third one br 3 the initial fe2 concentrations were 250 mg l and 2500 mg l respectively after around 45 h operation of the br 1 250 mg l tsb was supplemented to see whether biomass grew in fe2 free media the operational conditions of the batch reactors were summarized in table 3 2 4 co precipitation of iron and arsenic as biogenic schwertmannite at the end of periods 2 5 and 6 table 2 cmbr permeate was used for simultaneous fe3 and as v precipitation for this purpose 5 n naoh was added to the cmbr permeate collected in period 2 and the ph was raised to 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 to decide the optimum ph for co precipitation and or adsorptive removal of as v together with fe3 the experiments conducted in period 2 illustrated that both fe and as removals at ph 3 0 were only partial and therefore in the other periods 5 and 6 ph was raised to 3 5 and 4 0 to produce biogenic schwertmannite for selective co precipitation of fe and as in the experiments ph of 250 ml permeate was adjusted to the target value under around 5 min vigorous mixing then the permeate was left settling for around 30 min in a graduated cylinder the supernatant was syringe filtered for subsequent metal and as measurements 2 5 bacterial community analyses the bacterial community analyses were investigated according to our previous study demir et al 2020 the bacterial cultures of first period was used for the extraction of total dna demir et al 2020 nural yaman et al 2020 the total dna with high quality were sent to service bm software consultancy and lab system co ltd ankara turkey for 16s amplicon sequencing which was performed by illumina miseq platform demir et al 2020 the raw data were analyzed by qiime 2020 2 environment the quality controls of paired end sequences were done by fastqc the command with dada2 filtered the quality scores in the paired end sequences to correct errors and remove the chimeras close reference clustering of otus were preferred and aligned against the ncbi database nural yaman et al 2020 all files were visualized by qiime2 view toolbar

to analyze the changes in community livak and schmittgen 2001 relative quantification real time pcr using sybr green i or taqman probe was employed with the specific primer sets to determine the gene copy number of different microbial groups tajadini et al 2014 designed primer pairs and universal primer pairs for 16s rrna table 4 were used for relative quantitative 2 δδct method all reactions were carried out in abi 7500 thermo scientific usa the total volume of the pcr reaction mix was 20 μl made up of syber green master mix 1x forward and reverse primer 10 μm and 2 μl template cdna for each assay all samples were run in triplicate the thermal cycling conditions were 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 60 s one cycle with an initial 95 c denaturation 15 min the relative expression levels were calculated using the 2 δδct method of livak and schmittgen 2001 2 7 analytical methods for the measurements of fe2 cod mlss and mlvss concentrations standard methods apha 2005 were used in the permeate cod and fe2 were measured without further filtration the colorimetric ortho phenanthroline method given in standard methods apha 2005 was used for fe2 measurement tsb concentration was measured as cod and the contribution of fe2 to the cod was excluded considering theoretical oxygen demand of fe2 0 14 mg o2 mg fe2 according to r 2 to measure total fe first of all fe3 was reduced to fe2 using ascorbic acid jones and johnson 2015 then fe2 was measured and expressed as total fe total arsenic without differentiating as iii and as v and other metals were measured using thermo icap rq icp ms at osmangazi university central research laboratory application and research center arum eskişehir turkey wtw multi 3420 and hach hq40d multimeter were used for orp and ph measurements respectively fe2 was analyzed only once considering a stable calibration curve less than 3 error in the measurements and the regular three times a week sampling the heavy metals and arsenic were measured in triplicates specific resistance to filtration srf supernatant filterability sf capillary suction time cst and viscosity were measured according to dereli et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of continuously operated cmbr in the first period the performance of fe2 oxidation was evaluated in the absence of other heavy metals at an hrt of 24 h almost complete fe2 oxidation was obtained with the permeate fe2 concentration of 1 8 0 1 mg l the feed and the permeate orp values were 372 12 mv and 613 8 mv respectively fig 1 the cod concentrations in the feed and the permeate were 178 28 mg l and 24 13 mg l respectively corresponding to 87 cod removal in the second period days 20 41 heavy metals table 1 were supplemented to investigate their impact on fe2 oxidation performance while keeping the other operational conditions constant table 2 fe2 oxidation performance was not adversely affected as permeate fe2 concentration was 1 5 0 5 mg l corresponding to 99 oxidation together with orp values of 608 8 mv fig 1 the mean influent and permeate cod concentrations were 198 15 mg l and 45 6 mg l respectively corresponding to 77 cod oxidation in the third period days 41 59 hrt was decreased to 12 h by doubling the feed flow rate keeping all the other operational conditions constant table 2 membrane flux increased from 2 55 l m2 h lmh to 5 1 lmh although the hrt in the bioreactor was decreased the permeate fe2 concentration averaged 1 6 0 3 mg l corresponding to 99 oxidation efficiency the average orp value increased from 379 9 mv in the influent to around 608 8 mv in the permeate the mean influent and permeate cod concentrations were 193 4 and 39 2 mg l respectively corresponding to around 80 oxidation performance in the fourth period days 59 83 the feed flow rate was increased to obtain an hrt of 6 h table 2 increasing the flux to 10 2 lmh resulted in significant membrane fouling to be discussed later as tmp increased to 800 900 mbar although the membrane was back washed regularly once every two days in this period the bioreactor overflew three times one more membrane was added to the bioreactor on day 66 to decrease the flux back to 5 1 lmh after which tmp did not exceed 500 mbar until day 81 although the hrt in the cmbr was decreased substantially fe2 concentration at the permeate averaged 2 8 2 1 mg l corresponding to around 99 oxidation efficiency the average orp value at the influent was 368 11 mv and increased to around 567 30 mv at the permeate in this period the average feed and permeate cod concentrations were 191 5 and 43 5 mg l 78 oxidation respectively in the fifth period days 83 105 the influent fe2 was increased to 750 mg l keeping all the other operational conditions constant table 2 the fe2 concentration at the permeate of the bioreactor increased to 20 7 mg l corresponding to 97 oxidation efficiency the average orp increased from 353 7 mv in the influent to 577 33 mv in the permeate the influent and permeate cod concentrations were 200 6 and 46 7 mg l respectively corresponding to 77 oxidation efficiency in the sixth period days 105 131 tsb was eliminated from the feed table 2 to evaluate the bioreactor performance in the absence of an external organic matter for 26 days of operation fe2 concentration in the permeate was 13 0 2 mg l corresponding to 98 oxidation efficiency the orp increased from 352 3 mv in the influent to 645 7 mv in the permeate high fe2 oxidation performances 97 99 were similar to those reported in our previous study demir et al 2020 permeate fe2 concentrations were in line with the orp results fe precipitation fig 2 within the bioreactor was not observed which may be due to relatively low ph 2 1 0 06 and low fe na k and nh4 concentrations and hence jarosite formation was negligible similar to our previous study demir et al 2020 influent and permeate phs were 2 0 0 02 and 2 1 0 06 respectively throughout the study however ph was slightly higher in the permeate during periods 5 6 2 16 0 02 compared to periods 1 4 2 07 0 05 fig 3 which may be due to higher h ion consumption during fe2 oxidation according to r 2 the suspended ss and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations in the cmbr showed an increasing trend fig 3 as sludge was not wasted from the bioreactor except for sampling hence sludge retention time srt may be considered as infinite the vss was 4170 990 mg l in period 5 and 4370 144 mg l in period 6 thus the biomass growth during the last period was rather slow the influent and the permeate cod concentrations averaged 193 12 mg l and 40 10 mg l respectively between periods 1 and 5 data not shown during the operation of the cmbr no removal of metals was detected data not shown due to relatively low ph and no or undetectable formation of fe containing precipitates such as jarosite to which metals or metalloids can be adsorbed after biological oxidation of fe2 according to r 2 jarosite formation may be described with the following reaction bigham et al 2010 r 8 3fe3 m 2so4 2 6h2o mfe3 so4 2 oh 6 6h where m refers to monovalent ions such as k na nh4 and h3o daoud and karamanev 2006 studied the optimum temperature and ph at which jarosite formation was minimal and fe2 oxidation by acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was at high rates they reported a high fe2 oxidation rate and insignificant jarosite formation at room temperature 22 c and ph from 1 6 to 2 0 the jarosite formation hence mainly depended on ph temperature and the concentrations of fe and monovalent ions i e k na nh4 and h3o r 8 bigham et al 2010 in our study total feed and permeate iron concentrations were nearly the same fig 2 and jarosite formation and associated arsenic removal remained negligible throughout the study 3 2 filtration performance in the cmbr during the operation of the cmbr at 2 55 lmh no significant membrane fouling monitored as tmp was detected fig 4 between days 41 and 59 flux was increased to 5 1 lmh with no significant fouling then the flux increased to 10 2 lmh with decreasing the hrt to 6 h when the cmbr was operated with the one membrane module the tmp several times exceeded the 800 mbar although the membrane was physically cleaned once every two days by backwashing with the permeate after day 66 one more module was integrated and the flux was decreased back to 5 1 lmh to alleviate the membrane fouling the membrane fouling decreased significantly and after operation of around 14 days tmp increased to around 500 mbar on day 81 at which a backwash was applied to clean the membrane after increasing the feed fe2 to 750 mg l on day 83 the membrane fouling increased this may be due to pore blocking by small amount of fe containing precipitates e g jarosite at ph of 2 0 although not detected by total fe analyses in the feed and permeate physical membrane cleanings were applied almost every two days and on day 90 both membrane modules were chemically cleaned however tmp values still increased to high values within two days which resulted three times in cmbr overflow on day 99 periodic backwash of the membranes with the permeate 1 min at 30 lmh flux every three hours of operation was applied to alleviate the membrane fouling although regular backwashing decreased the membrane fouling more studies are required to optimize the membrane filtration performance also the filterability of the sludge in period 5 on two different days i e 97 and 101 were assessed the srf sf cst and viscosity were 1 1 0 5 1015 m kg 0 48 0 17 ml min 72 0 4 0 s and 2 14 0 12 cp respectively the filterability depends on many factors including the operational conditions especially srt pollice et al 2008 and the wastewater being treated in our study the mixed liquor is composed of high concentrations of metals at ph of 2 which may make the comparison with the results obtained with municipal or many other industrial wastewaters irrelevant for example pollice et al 2008 reported the srf values being in the range of 1010 1012 m kg for the sludge samples obtained from mbr treating real municipal wastewater cst may be used as an easily measurable parameter to obtain insight into sludge filterability in an mbr wang et al 2006b and or early warning for the membrane cleaning pollice et al 2008 a high value of cst indicates poor filterability of the sludge gabarrón et al 2013 reported full scale mbr treatment data for municipal wastewater and reported a cst value of 62 10 s 3 3 iron oxidation rates in batch operational cycles of cmbr the fe2 oxidation rates under varying conditions table 2 were determined by operating the cmbr in batch mode the variations of fe2 and orp values for batch operations of cmbr after each period were as illustrated in fig 5 the fe2 oxidation was completed within around 250 min in the first period i e in the absence of metal mixture and the fe2 oxidation rate was calculated as 0 97 mg fe2 l min when the medium was supplemented with a mixed metal cocktail the fe2 oxidation rate remained almost similar at 0 98 mg fe2 l min batch experiments at the end of periods 3 and 4 were also conducted to determine the impact of hrt on the fe2 oxidation rates of biomass the fe2 oxidation rates were calculated as 1 3 and 5 16 mg fe2 l min in periods 3 and 4 corresponding to hrts of 12 and 6 h in cmbr respectively hence decreasing the hrt or rather increasing the loading rate significantly increased the fe2 oxidation rate of biomass in period 5 increasing the feed fe2 concentration to 750 mg l significantly increased the fe2 oxidation rate to 21 75 mg fe2 l min hence the fe2 oxidation rate depends on its loading rate to the bioreactor in the last period cmbr was operated with organic matter free media and batch test showed that the fe2 oxidation rate decreased significantly to 10 68 mg fe2 l min the final fe2 concentration was around 15 mg l which was similar to the one observed in the period 5 17 mg l the orp data measured during the batch operations also illustrated the rate of fe2 oxidation as the values decreased to 460 470 mv after fe2 addition and it increased to 670 680 mv at the end of the batch operations the increase rate of orp completely depended on the fe2 oxidation rate fig 5 the specific fe2 oxidation rates were provided in fig 6 the supplementation of metal mixture in period 2 decreased the specific fe2 oxidation rate from 0 76 period 1 to 0 47 mg fe2 g vss min hence metal mixture may have some inhibitory effect on specific fe2 oxidation observing similar fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 l min which was discussed above but lower specific fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 g vss min was due to the higher biomass concentration in period 2 2 07 g l compared to period 1 1 27 g l increasing the fe2 loading rate to the cmbr significantly increased the specific fe2 oxidation rate reaching the capacity of 6 3 mg fe2 g vss min in period 5 removal of the tsb from the feed decreased the specific fe2 oxidation rate to around 2 36 mg fe2 g vss min hence the elimination of tsb significantly decreased the specific fe2 oxidation rate in long term operation in our previous study demir et al 2020 the fe2 oxidation rate followed monod equation with a half saturation constant of 549 mg l hence an increasing specific fe2 oxidation rate may be expected from the increasing feed fe2 concentration from 250 mg l to 750 mg l the biomass used in the kinetics assays in our previous study demir et al 2020 was obtained from the cmbr fed with around 1400 mg l fe2 at an hrt of 48 h hence the obtained specific fe2 oxidation rates are valid only under the studied operating conditions 3 4 evaluating the impact of tsb and fe2 concentrations in batch assays biomass growth in the absence of fe2 br 1 and at different initial fe2 concentrations br 2 and br 3 was studied in batch assays table 3 in the presence of 25 mg l tsb no or negligible biomass growth as od620 occurred in the absence br 1 and presence of 250 mg l fe2 br 2 when 250 mg l tsb was supplemented to the br 1 od620 increased substantially fig 7 the initial biomass concentration in all the batches was around 70 mg l and the final biomass concentrations in br 1 for 25 mg l and 250 mg l tsb were as illustrated in fig 7 hence biomass growth occurred even in the absence of fe2 demonstrating that the mixed culture uses tsb as a carbon and energy source according to jones and johnson 2016 free energy generation from fe2 oxidation is very small δg0 47 kj mol compared to glucose δg0 2880 kj mol hence in order to elucidate whether biomass obtains energy from fe2 oxidation its concentration was kept much higher compared to tsb considering the study of johnson et al 1992 tsb concentration was kept at 25 mg l in br 2 and br 3 whereas fe2 concentration was kept at significantly high levels i e 250 mg l in br 2 and 2500 mg l in br 3 fe2 oxidation was completed within around 45 h and 100 h in the br 2 and br 3 respectively data not shown the initial biomass concentration in all the batches was around 70 mg l and final vss concentrations in br 2 25 mg l tsb and 250 mg l fe2 and br 3 25 mg l tsb and 2500 mg l fe2 were around 74 mg l and 93 mg l respectively fig 7 hence slightly higher amount of biomass growth was observed when the media was supplemented with significantly higher initial fe2 concentration 3 5 16s amplicon sequencing microbial community was determined by 16s amplicon sequencing for the sample taken from the bioreactor during the first period table 2 i e in the absence of metal cocktail in the feed the bioinformatic analysis was performed by 100 identity in closed reference at the end of the analysis alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum were identified at species level the percentages of these bacteria were 48 and 45 respectively alicyclobacillus spp have been observed in various mixed bioleaching cultures obtained from mine sites halinen et al 2012 kaksonen et al 2016 yahya et al 2008 alicyclobacillus tolerans which is formerly classified in the genus sulfobacillus is aerobic gram positive spore forming rod and grows in the presence of organic compounds and fe2 kaksonen et al 2016 karavaiko et al 2005 alicyclobacillus tolerans has high tolerance to the changes in temperature and ph as it grows in a temperature and ph ranges of 20 55 c optimum 37 42 c and 1 5 5 0 optimum 2 5 2 7 respectively karavaiko et al 2005 acidiphilium cryptum is an obligate heterotroph and iron reducing microorganism that can be found in amd falagán and johnson 2018 gonzález et al 2018 3 6 relative quantification real time pcr the dnas extracted from the sludge samples taken from the cmbr during the four different periods periods 1 3 5 and 6 in table 2 were analysed with the specific primers the relative quantifications of the alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum in the samples were calculated and the impacts of the operational conditions table 2 on the relative variations of the species were determined the first operational period in which metal cocktails were not supplemented to the feed was used as a baseline and the relative contribution of the species identified by amplicon sequencing in other periods were comparatively evaluated as the first period was accepted to be the baseline period the relative quantity of both species in period 1 was accepted as 1 0 and the relative quantity of each specie in other periods was determined in the third period the relative quantities of alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum increased to 27 4 and 1 6 respectively which should be due to increased fe2 loadings from 0 25 g l d in period 1 to 0 5 g l d in period 3 with a 12 fold increase in the fe2 loading in period 5 relative quantities of alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum increased to 42 0 and 77 0 respectively table 5 however in the last period the relative quantities of alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum decreased to 6 47 and 0 006 respectively which should be due to the elimination of organic matter tsb from the feeding media table 5 almost total disappearance of the acidiphilium cryptum is an expected result as it is an obligate heterotroph falagán and johnson 2018 and could not be sustained in period 6 due to feeding of the bioreactor with an organic matter free medium table 2 alicyclobacillus tolerans is a facultative chemo organoheterotroph and mixotroph strain but shows better growth under mixotrophic growth conditions rather than on organics alone da costa et al 2015 karavaiko et al 2005 holanda and johnson 2020 reported that alicyclobacillus tolerans can grow both heterotrophically and autotrophically on fe2 hence in period 6 in which the organic matter was excluded from the feed alicyclobacillus tolerans was sustained but with a decreased relative quantity compared to the previous periods 3 7 co precipitation of iron and arsenic as biogenic schwertmannite co precipitation of as and fe as schwertmannite is favored by ph ranging from 2 8 to 4 5 wang et al 2006a the schwertmannite formation is represented by the following reaction hedrich and johnson 2012 r 9 8fe3 so4 2 14h2o fe8o8 oh 6 so4 22h in period 2 the permeate contained 250 mg l fe and 25 mg l as and fe as ratio of 10 the ph effects on the co precipitation performance was investigated the ph was adjusted to 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 in parallel batch tests and the soluble fe and as concentrations were as given in fig 8 the initial as concentration was around 27 mg l and decreased to 10 7 0 82 0 5 and 0 25 mg l at ph of 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 respectively hence as removal efficiency was only 60 at ph 3 0 and increased to 97 at ph 3 5 further increasing the ph increased the removal performance even to 99 at ph 4 5 the ph 3 5 however may be considered optimal the total fe concentration in the permeate period 2 was around 260 mg l and it decreased to 181 2 52 0 34 and 1 21 mg l at ph of 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 respectively hence at ph 3 5 quite high fe removal efficiency was also attained at ph 3 0 only 30 fe precipitated which may have resulted in partial as removal at ph 3 0 in periods 5 and 6 the similar experiment was also conducted at ph 3 5 and 4 0 and at initial fe as ratio of 30 fe precipitations were similar with the total fe concentrations of 3 7 mg l at ph 3 5 in both periods the total fe concentrations decreased to around 1 44 and 0 93 at ph 4 0 in periods 5 and 6 respectively as in the permeate decreased to around 0 5 and 0 09 mg l at ph 3 5 in periods 5 and 6 respectively when the ph was increased to 4 0 the permeate as concentrations decreased to 0 37 and 0 07 mg l in respective order fig 8 hence co precipitation of fe and as with biogenic schwertmannite production at ph 3 5 results in 98 99 removals of fe and as similarly ahoranta et al 2016 reported as removal at ph 3 0 as high as 99 5 corresponding to a total as concentration of 0 03 mg l in the effluent of settling tank integrated to a fbr the higher removal at ph 3 0 in the study of ahoranta et al 2016 compared to the present study was likely due to much higher fe2 concentration 5 g l used the other metals remained in solution during the schwertmannite precipitation as expected due to relatively low ph data not shown hence sulfidogenic anaerobic processes may be used as down stream process to recover valuable metals bayrakdar et al 2009 after schwertmannite precipitation 4 conclusions the cmbr performance for the fe2 oxidation in a synthetic amd was revealed at varying fe2 loadings 0 25 3 0 g l d and in the presence and absence of tsb with the following conclusions 98 99 of iron oxidation is obtained in cmbr the metal mixture supplementation decreases the specific fe2 oxidation rate from 0 76 to 0 47 mg fe2 g vss min the specific fe2 oxidation rate up to 6 3 mg fe2 g vss min can be obtained whilst the removal of tsb from the feed decreases the rate by 62 to 2 4 mg fe2 g vss min 99 selective co precipitation of as and fe associated with schwertmannite precipitation is triggered by controlling ph to 3 5 4 0 with naoh sustainable membrane filtration of up to 5 0 lmh is achieved by regular backwash without long term chemical cleaning alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum dominate the mixed culture acidiphilium cryptum an obligate heterotroph is almost eliminated from the mixed culture when the bioreactor is fed with organic free media

at varying hydraulic retention times hrts 6 24 h and two different feed fe2 concentrations 250 and 750 mg l the impact of tryptone soya broth tsb on the cmbr performance was also investigated almost complete fe2 oxidation and sustainable flux at around 5 0 l m2 h were obtained in the cmbr with the alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum dominated enrichment culture the fe2 oxidation rate as assessed in batch operation cycles of cmbr increased significantly with increasing fe2 loading to the bioreactor the iron oxidation rate decreased by the elimination of organic matter from the feed the increase of the cmbr permeate ph to 3 5 4 0 resulted in selective co precipitation of as and fe over 99 with the generation of biogenic schwertmannite keywords iron oxidation acid mine

mines stockpiles and spent heap leach dumps natarajan 2008 among the metal sulfides pyrite fes2 is the main mineral responsible for the amd generation as its bio oxidation may be quite fast when exposed to water and air kefeni et al 2017 amd causes severe environmental problems due to its low ph high concentration of toxic heavy metals metalloids and sulfate aytar et al 2015 blodau 2006 kefeni et al 2017 ferrous iron is bio oxidized to ferric iron forming iron oxide precipitates known as a yellow boy reactions 1 3 kefeni et al 2017 in general acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and

bioprocesses can also be used for amd treatment demir et al 2020 rowe and johnson 2008 for this purpose many types of bioreactors have been used including fluidized bed reactors fbr ozkaya et al 2007 biological jarosite carrier based biofilms ahoranta et al 2020 packed bed bioreactors rowe and johnson 2008 a modular continuous flow bioreactor hedrich and johnson 2012 serially connected tank reactors filled with suspended biofilm carriers sandström and mattsson 2001 and even membrane bioreactors demir et al 2020 park et al 2005 conventional active chemical treatment e g lime addition aeration and precipitation of metal hydroxides at ph 7 8 5 may have generate voluminous and poorly settleable sludge hedrich and johnson 2012 and result in high operational costs associated with high dosages of chemicals amd contains iron arsenic and many other precious heavy metals i e cu and zn hence the removal of non precious iron together with toxic arsenic ahoranta et al 2016 may increase the possibility of recovering precious heavy metals from amd and decreases the treatment and sludge handling cost in this context hedrich johnson 2012 used a modular continuous bioreactor system for iron oxidation in the first reactor inoculated with autotrophic ferrovum myxofaciens selective iron precipitation as schwertmannite at ph 3 5 in the second reactor and a third packed bed polishing bioreactor after which soluble iron decreased to 1 mg l the modular system selectively removed iron from a synthetic amd containing al cu mn and zn in another study ahoranta et al 2016 investigated iron oxidation in an fbr and simultaneous removal of ferric iron and arsenic in a gravity settler connected to the fbr they achieved high fe2 5 g l oxidation and as iii 10 mg l removals 99 at ph 3 0 due to adsorption and co precipitation with biogenic jarosite selective arsenic and iron separation from valuable metal solution during bioleaching has also been reported wakeman et al 2011 amd treatment researches have focused on uses of autotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria such as acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans however many heterotrophic and mixotrophic bacteria oxidize ferrous iron rowe and johnson 2008 high efficiency of iron oxidation depends on the quantity of bacteria retained in the bioreactor however reaching high quantity of autotrophic iron oxidizers may be slow due to low energy gain from the oxidation of iron rowe and johnson 2008 especially at low concentrations hence the use of organic nutrient supplementation may be advantageous especially during the initial commissioning of the bioprocess due to higher growth yield of heterotrophs mixotrophs compared to autotrophic counterparts demir et al 2020 rowe and johnson 2008 several studies have reported the use of biofilm reactors for iron oxidation ahoranta et al 2020 özkaya et al 2007 sandström and mattsson 2001 whilst membrane bioreactors mbrs to retain iron oxidizing acidophiles have rarely been used demir et al 2020 park et al 2005 some microorganisms may not attach to the media present in biofilm reactors hence the process performance may completely depend on the attachment performance of the culture on the selected media also it may be difficult to aerate and achieve proper hydraulic conditions in some biofilm reactors hence mbrs which have deserved significant attention in recent years for wastewater treatment huang and lee 2015 may also be used as an alternative to biofilm reactors for iron oxidation in our previous study demir et al 2020 efficiency of ceramic mbr cmbr for iron oxidation in the presence of an organic compound was demonstrated however the presence of metals often encountered in amd e g cu co mn zn ni and as on the process performance has not been investigated this study aims at investigating the performance of a cmbr at varying hydraulic retention times hrts and membrane fluxes for iron oxidation in a synthetic containing fe cu co mn zn ni and as amd the cmbr performance was also tested in the presence and absence of an organic matter further dynamic changes of bacterial community in the cmbr was investigated also the selective precipitation of iron and arsenic in the cmbr permeate as schwertmannite at phs 3 0 4 0 was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceramic membrane bioreactor and the composition of synthetic amd the cmbr was operated previously demir et al 2020 in the presence of ferrous iron 1400 mg l and tryptone soya broth tsb 250 mg l at ph 1 5 2 5 for 205 days the details about the bioreactor were presented in demir et al 2020 briefly the bioreactor had a total and working volumes of 4 7 l and 3 0 l respectively the pore size of the ceramic flat sheet membrane cembrane was 0 1 µm and the total filtration area of a module was 0 049 m2 an intermittent suction of 5 min on and 1 min relaxation cycles were adopted to decrease the cake formation on the membrane the bioreactor was continuously aerated to keep dissolved oxygen 3 mg l and scour the cake deposited on the membrane the bioreactor was operated without any temperature control at 27 1 6 c the cmbr operated in our previous study for 205 days demir et al 2020 was dominated by acidiphilium cryptum and alicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus in the present study fe2 oxidation performance of the cmbr was evaluated in the presence of other heavy metals cu co mn zn and ni and as possibly found in amd table 1 synthetic wastewater was prepared with tap water whose ph value was adjusted to 2 0 using concentrated h2so4 nutrients and the metals prepared as 100 times concentrated solutions were supplemented to reach desired concentrations provided in table 1 h2asko4 was used in the preparation of as v stock solution the synthetic amd was also supplemented with 250 mg l tsb as an organic carbon and nutrient source to support biomass growth when the bioreactor was fed with tsb free media period 6 table 2 22 mg l kh2po4 was added as a p source for bacterial growth in the beginning the cmbr was fed with metal free media period 1 table 2 to evaluate the fe2 oxidation performance in the absence of high heavy metal concentrations metals at low concentrations were supplemented as nutrients table 1 after period 1 metals provided as a separate column in table 1 were added to the nutrient supplemented media to simulate amd 2 2 operational conditions of the ceramic membrane bioreactor the cmbr was operated under varying operational conditions table 2 in the first period table 2 the bioreactor was fed with 250 mg l fe2 in the absence of metal mixture at an hrt of 24 h in the 2nd period the metal mixture was added to the feed and the bioreactor performance was evaluated under varying hrts and fluxes in the 3rd and the 4th periods hrt was decreased to 12 h and 6 h respectively keeping the influent fe2 concentration at 250 mg l in the 5th period feed fe2 concentration was increased to 750 mg l to evaluated the bioreactor performance under increasing fe2 loading lastly in the 6th period tsb was eliminated from the synthetic feed the fe2 loading rate in the cmbr was changed between 0 25 and 3 0 g l d by varying the feed fe2 or hrt at the end of each period continuous operation of the cmbr was ceased and a concentrated fe2 solution was directly added to the cmbr the cmbr was then operated batch wise under aeration and the reactor was sampled to evaluate the time course variation of fe2 orp and ph the batch operations were continued until the orp values reached the ones recorded during the continuous operation i e orp 600 mv in this way the impacts of operational conditions table 2 on the fe2 oxidation rates were also evaluated under batch cycles of cmbr similar to our previous study demir et al 2020 membrane fouling was monitored by the transmembrane pressure tmp measurements the fluxes in the cmbr were changed between 2 55 and 10 2 lmh depending on the hrt and the numbers of membrane modules table 2 when tmp exceeds around 400 mbar a permeate backwash was provided to scour the cake gel layer on the membrane only one chemical cleaning was applied on day 90 in a 1 m h2so4 solution first and then in a 1 naocl solution for 1 day on day 99 periodic backwash cycles were started to alleviate membrane fouling the membranes were back washed with permeate at 30 lmh flux for 1 min durations every three hours of operation in period 5 the cmbr content was also sampled for the measurement of specific resistance to filtration srf supernatant filterability sf capillary suction time cst and viscosity 2 3 evaluating the impact of tsb and fe2 concentration in batch tests first of all a 1 l batch reactor was set up with a 10 ml sludge obtained from the cmbr on day 66 and the batch reactor was fed with initial tsb and fe2 concentrations of 250 mg l each the reactor was fed with the same concentrated solution three cycles to acclimate the biomass to batch operation then three parallel 1 l batch reactors were operated to evaluate the impacts of fe2 and tsb concentrations on the fe2 oxidation rate and biomass growth the initial tsb concentrations in all the parallels were 25 mg l and the initial phs were adjusted to around 2 0 using sulfuric acid all the reactors were seeded with 250 ml sludge obtained from the batch reactor described above in this way biomass already acclimated to batch conditions were used the first batch reactor br 1 was operated in the absence of fe2 whereas in the second br 2 and the third one br 3 the initial fe2 concentrations were 250 mg l and 2500 mg l respectively after around 45 h operation of the br 1 250 mg l tsb was supplemented to see whether biomass grew in fe2 free media the operational conditions of the batch reactors were summarized in table 3 2 4 co precipitation of iron and arsenic as biogenic schwertmannite at the end of periods 2 5 and 6 table 2 cmbr permeate was used for simultaneous fe3 and as v precipitation for this purpose 5 n naoh was added to the cmbr permeate collected in period 2 and the ph was raised to 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 to decide the optimum ph for co precipitation and or adsorptive removal of as v together with fe3 the experiments conducted in period 2 illustrated that both fe and as removals at ph 3 0 were only partial and therefore in the other periods 5 and 6 ph was raised to 3 5 and 4 0 to produce biogenic schwertmannite for selective co precipitation of fe and as in the experiments ph of 250 ml permeate was adjusted to the target value under around 5 min vigorous mixing then the permeate was left settling for around 30 min in a graduated cylinder the supernatant was syringe filtered for subsequent metal and as measurements 2 5 bacterial community analyses the bacterial community analyses were investigated according to our previous study demir et al 2020 the bacterial cultures of first period was used for the extraction of total dna demir et al 2020 nural yaman et al 2020 the total dna

copy number of different microbial groups tajadini et al 2014 designed primer pairs and universal primer pairs for 16s rrna table 4 were used for relative quantitative 2 δδct method all reactions were carried out in abi 7500 thermo scientific usa the total volume of the pcr reaction mix was 20 μl made up of syber green master mix 1x forward and reverse primer 10 μm and 2 μl template cdna for each assay all samples were run in triplicate the thermal cycling conditions were 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 60 s one cycle with an initial 95 c denaturation 15 min the relative expression levels were calculated using the 2 δδct method of livak and schmittgen 2001 2 7 analytical methods for the measurements of fe2 cod mlss and mlvss concentrations standard methods apha 2005 were used in the permeate cod and fe2 were measured without further filtration the colorimetric ortho phenanthroline method given in standard methods apha 2005 was used for fe2 measurement tsb concentration was measured as cod and the contribution of fe2 to the cod was excluded considering theoretical oxygen demand of fe2 0 14 mg o2 mg fe2 according to r 2 to measure total fe first of all fe3 was reduced to fe2 using ascorbic acid jones and johnson 2015 then fe2 was measured and expressed as total fe total arsenic without differentiating as iii and as v and other metals were measured using thermo icap rq icp ms at osmangazi university central research laboratory application and research center arum eskişehir turkey wtw multi 3420 and hach hq40d multimeter were used for orp and ph measurements respectively fe2 was analyzed only once considering a stable calibration curve less than 3 error in the measurements and the regular three times a week sampling the heavy metals and arsenic were measured in triplicates specific resistance to filtration srf supernatant filterability sf capillary suction time cst and viscosity were measured according to dereli et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of continuously operated cmbr in the first period the performance of fe2 oxidation was evaluated in the absence of other heavy metals at an hrt of 24 h almost complete fe2 oxidation was obtained with the permeate fe2 concentration of 1 8 0 1 mg l the feed and the permeate orp values were 372 12 mv and 613 8 mv respectively fig 1 the cod concentrations in the feed and the permeate were 178 28 mg l and 24 13 mg l respectively corresponding to 87 cod removal in the second period days 20 41 heavy metals table 1 were supplemented to investigate their impact on fe2 oxidation performance while keeping the other operational conditions constant table 2 fe2 oxidation performance was not adversely affected as permeate fe2 concentration was 1 5 0 5 mg l corresponding to 99 oxidation together with orp values of 608 8 mv fig 1 the mean influent and permeate cod concentrations were 198 15 mg l and 45 6 mg l respectively corresponding to 77 cod oxidation in the third period days 41 59 hrt was decreased to 12 h by doubling the feed flow rate keeping all the other operational conditions constant table 2 membrane flux increased from 2 55 l m2 h lmh to 5 1 lmh although the hrt in the bioreactor was decreased the permeate fe2 concentration averaged 1 6 0 3 mg l corresponding to 99 oxidation efficiency the average orp value increased from 379 9 mv in the influent to around 608 8 mv in the permeate the mean influent and permeate cod concentrations were 193 4 and 39 2 mg l respectively corresponding to around 80 oxidation performance in the fourth period days 59 83 the feed flow rate was increased to obtain an hrt of 6 h table 2 increasing the flux to 10 2 lmh resulted in significant membrane fouling to be discussed later as tmp increased to 800 900 mbar although the membrane was back washed regularly once every two days in this period the bioreactor overflew three times one more membrane was added to the bioreactor on day 66 to decrease the flux back to 5 1 lmh after which tmp did not exceed 500 mbar until day 81 although the hrt in the cmbr was decreased substantially fe2 concentration at the permeate averaged 2 8 2 1 mg l corresponding to around 99 oxidation efficiency the average orp value at the influent was 368 11 mv and increased to around 567 30 mv at the permeate in this period the average feed and permeate cod concentrations were 191 5 and 43 5 mg l 78 oxidation respectively in the fifth period days 83 105 the influent fe2 was increased to 750 mg l keeping all the other operational conditions constant table 2 the fe2 concentration at the permeate of the bioreactor increased to 20 7 mg l corresponding to 97 oxidation efficiency the average orp increased from 353 7 mv in the influent to 577 33 mv in the permeate the influent and permeate cod concentrations were 200 6 and 46 7 mg l respectively corresponding to 77 oxidation efficiency in the sixth period days 105 131 tsb was eliminated from the feed table 2 to evaluate the bioreactor performance in the absence of an external organic matter for 26 days of operation fe2 concentration in the permeate was 13 0 2 mg l corresponding to 98 oxidation efficiency the orp increased from 352 3 mv in the influent to 645 7 mv in the permeate high fe2 oxidation performances 97 99 were similar to those reported in our previous study demir et al 2020 permeate fe2 concentrations were in line with the orp results fe precipitation fig 2 within the bioreactor was not observed which may be due to relatively low ph 2 1 0 06 and low fe na k and nh4 concentrations and hence jarosite formation was negligible similar to our previous study demir et al 2020 influent and permeate phs were 2 0 0 02 and 2 1 0 06 respectively throughout the study however ph was slightly higher in the permeate during periods 5 6 2 16 0 02 compared to periods 1 4 2 07 0 05 fig 3 which may be due to higher h ion consumption during fe2 oxidation according to r 2 the suspended ss and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations in the cmbr showed an increasing trend fig 3 as sludge was not wasted from the bioreactor except for sampling hence sludge retention time srt may be considered as infinite the vss was 4170 990 mg l in period 5 and 4370 144 mg l in period 6 thus the biomass growth during the last period was rather slow the influent and the permeate cod concentrations averaged 193 12 mg l and 40 10 mg l respectively between periods 1 and 5 data not shown during the operation of the cmbr no removal of metals was detected data not shown due to relatively low ph and no or undetectable formation of fe containing precipitates such as jarosite to which metals or metalloids can be adsorbed after biological oxidation of fe2 according to r 2 jarosite formation may be described with the following reaction bigham et al 2010 r 8 3fe3 m 2so4 2 6h2o mfe3 so4 2 oh 6 6h where m refers to monovalent ions such as k na nh4 and h3o daoud and karamanev 2006 studied the optimum temperature and ph at which jarosite formation was minimal and fe2 oxidation by acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was at high rates they reported a high fe2 oxidation rate and insignificant jarosite formation at room temperature 22 c and ph from 1 6 to 2 0 the jarosite formation hence mainly depended on ph temperature and the concentrations of fe and monovalent ions i e k na nh4 and h3o r 8 bigham et al 2010 in our study total feed and permeate iron concentrations were nearly the same fig 2 and jarosite formation and associated arsenic removal remained negligible throughout the study 3 2 filtration performance in the cmbr during the operation of the cmbr at 2 55 lmh no significant membrane fouling monitored as tmp was detected fig 4 between days 41 and 59 flux was increased to 5 1 lmh with no significant fouling then the flux increased to 10 2 lmh with decreasing the hrt to 6 h when the cmbr was operated with the one membrane module the tmp several times exceeded the 800 mbar although the membrane was physically cleaned once every two days by backwashing with the permeate after day 66 one more module was integrated and the flux was decreased back to 5 1 lmh to alleviate the membrane fouling the membrane fouling decreased significantly and after operation of around 14 days tmp increased to around 500 mbar on day 81 at which a backwash was applied to clean the membrane after increasing the feed fe2 to 750 mg l on day 83 the membrane fouling increased this may be due to pore blocking by small amount of fe containing precipitates e g jarosite at ph of 2 0 although not detected by total fe analyses in the feed and permeate physical membrane cleanings were applied almost every two days and on day 90 both membrane modules were chemically cleaned however tmp values still increased to high values within two days which resulted three times in cmbr overflow on day 99 periodic backwash of the membranes with the permeate 1 min at 30 lmh flux every three hours of operation was applied to alleviate the membrane fouling although regular backwashing decreased the membrane fouling more studies are required to optimize the membrane filtration performance also the filterability of the sludge in period 5 on two different days i e 97 and 101 were assessed the srf sf cst and viscosity were 1 1 0 5 1015 m kg 0 48 0 17 ml min 72 0 4 0 s and 2 14 0 12 cp respectively the filterability depends on many factors including the operational conditions especially srt pollice et al 2008 and the wastewater being treated in our study the mixed liquor is composed of high concentrations of metals at ph of 2 which may make the comparison with the results obtained with municipal or many other industrial wastewaters irrelevant for example pollice et al 2008 reported the srf values being in the range of 1010 1012 m kg for the sludge samples obtained from mbr treating real municipal wastewater cst may be used as an easily measurable parameter to obtain insight into sludge filterability in an mbr wang et al 2006b and or early warning for the membrane cleaning pollice et al 2008 a high value of cst indicates poor filterability of the sludge gabarrón et al 2013 reported full scale mbr treatment data for municipal wastewater and reported a cst value of 62 10 s 3 3 iron oxidation rates in batch operational cycles of cmbr the fe2 oxidation rates under varying conditions table 2 were determined by operating the cmbr in batch mode the variations of fe2 and orp values for batch operations of cmbr after each period were as illustrated in fig 5 the fe2 oxidation was completed within around 250 min in the first period i e in the absence of metal mixture and the fe2 oxidation rate was calculated as 0 97 mg fe2 l min when the medium was supplemented with a mixed metal cocktail the fe2 oxidation rate remained almost similar at 0 98 mg fe2 l min batch experiments at the end of periods 3 and 4 were also conducted to determine the impact of hrt on the fe2 oxidation rates of biomass the fe2 oxidation rates were calculated as 1 3 and 5 16 mg fe2 l min in periods 3 and 4 corresponding to hrts of 12 and 6 h in cmbr respectively hence decreasing the hrt or rather increasing the loading rate significantly increased the fe2 oxidation rate of biomass in period 5 increasing the feed fe2 concentration to 750 mg l significantly increased the fe2 oxidation rate to 21 75 mg fe2 l min hence the fe2 oxidation rate depends on its loading rate to the bioreactor in the last period cmbr was operated with organic matter free media and batch test showed that the fe2 oxidation rate decreased significantly to 10 68 mg fe2 l min the final fe2 concentration was around 15 mg l which was similar to the one observed in the period 5 17 mg l the orp data measured during the batch operations also illustrated the rate of fe2 oxidation as the values decreased to 460 470 mv after fe2 addition and it increased to 670 680 mv at the end of the batch operations the increase rate of orp completely depended on the fe2 oxidation rate fig 5 the specific fe2 oxidation rates were provided in fig 6 the supplementation of metal mixture in period 2 decreased the specific fe2 oxidation rate from 0 76 period 1 to 0 47 mg fe2 g vss min hence metal mixture may have some inhibitory effect on specific fe2 oxidation observing similar fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 l min which was discussed above but lower specific fe2 oxidation rate as mg fe2 g vss min was due to the higher biomass concentration in period 2 2 07 g l compared to period 1 1 27 g l increasing the fe2 loading rate to the cmbr significantly increased the specific fe2 oxidation rate reaching the capacity of 6 3 mg fe2 g vss min in period 5 removal of the tsb from the feed decreased the specific fe2 oxidation rate to around 2 36 mg fe2 g vss min hence the elimination of tsb significantly decreased the specific fe2 oxidation rate in long term operation in our previous study demir et al 2020 the fe2 oxidation rate followed monod equation with a half saturation constant of 549 mg l hence an increasing specific fe2 oxidation rate may be expected from the increasing feed fe2 concentration from 250 mg l to 750 mg l the biomass used in the kinetics assays in our previous study demir et al 2020 was obtained from the cmbr fed with around 1400 mg l fe2 at an hrt of 48 h hence the obtained specific fe2 oxidation rates are valid only under the studied operating conditions 3 4 evaluating the impact of tsb and fe2 concentrations in batch assays biomass growth in the absence of fe2 br 1 and at different initial fe2 concentrations br 2 and br 3 was studied in batch assays table 3 in the presence of 25 mg l tsb no or negligible biomass growth as od620 occurred in the absence br 1 and presence of 250 mg l fe2 br 2 when 250 mg l tsb was supplemented to the br 1 od620 increased substantially fig 7 the initial biomass concentration in all the batches was around 70 mg l and the final biomass concentrations in br 1 for 25 mg l and 250 mg l tsb were as illustrated in fig 7 hence biomass growth occurred even in the absence of fe2 demonstrating that the mixed culture uses tsb as a carbon and energy source according to jones and johnson 2016 free energy generation from fe2 oxidation is very small δg0 47 kj mol compared to glucose δg0 2880 kj mol hence in order to elucidate whether biomass obtains energy from fe2 oxidation its concentration was kept much higher compared to tsb considering the study of johnson et al 1992 tsb concentration was kept at 25 mg l in br 2 and br 3 whereas fe2 concentration was kept at significantly high levels i e 250 mg l in br 2 and 2500 mg l in br 3 fe2 oxidation was completed within around 45 h and 100 h in the br 2 and br 3 respectively data not shown the initial biomass concentration in all the batches was around 70 mg l and final vss concentrations in br 2 25 mg l tsb and 250 mg l fe2 and br 3 25 mg l tsb and 2500 mg l fe2 were around 74 mg l and 93 mg l respectively fig 7 hence slightly higher amount of biomass growth was observed when the media was supplemented with significantly higher initial fe2 concentration 3 5 16s amplicon sequencing microbial community was determined by 16s amplicon sequencing for the sample taken from the bioreactor during the first period table 2 i e in the absence of metal cocktail in the feed the bioinformatic analysis was performed by 100 identity in closed reference at the end of the analysis alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum were identified at species level the percentages of these bacteria were 48 and 45 respectively alicyclobacillus spp have been observed in various mixed bioleaching cultures obtained from mine sites halinen et al 2012 kaksonen et al 2016 yahya et al 2008 alicyclobacillus tolerans which is formerly classified in the genus sulfobacillus is aerobic gram positive spore forming rod and grows in the presence of organic compounds and fe2 kaksonen et al 2016 karavaiko et al 2005 alicyclobacillus tolerans has high tolerance to the changes in temperature and ph as it grows in a temperature and ph ranges of 20 55 c optimum 37 42 c and 1 5 5 0 optimum 2 5 2 7 respectively karavaiko et al 2005 acidiphilium cryptum is an obligate heterotroph and iron reducing microorganism that can be found in amd falagán and johnson 2018 gonzález et al 2018 3 6 relative quantification real time pcr the dnas extracted from the sludge samples taken from the cmbr during the four different periods periods 1 3 5 and 6 in table 2 were analysed with the specific primers the relative quantifications of the alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum in the samples were calculated and the impacts of the operational conditions table 2 on the relative variations of the species were determined the first operational period in which metal cocktails were not supplemented to the feed was used as a baseline and the relative contribution of the species identified by amplicon sequencing in other periods were comparatively evaluated as the first period was accepted to be the baseline period the relative quantity of both species in period 1 was accepted as 1 0 and the relative quantity of each specie in other periods was determined in the third period the relative quantities of alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum increased to 27 4 and 1 6 respectively which should be due to increased fe2 loadings from 0 25 g l d in period 1 to 0 5 g l d in period 3 with a 12 fold increase in the fe2 loading in period 5 relative quantities of alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum increased to 42 0 and 77 0 respectively table 5 however in the last period the relative quantities of alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum decreased to 6 47 and 0 006 respectively which should be due to the elimination of organic matter tsb from the feeding media table 5 almost total disappearance of the acidiphilium cryptum is an expected result as it is an obligate heterotroph falagán and johnson 2018 and could not be sustained in period 6 due to feeding of the bioreactor with an organic matter free medium table 2 alicyclobacillus tolerans is a facultative chemo organoheterotroph and mixotroph strain but shows better growth under mixotrophic growth conditions rather than on organics alone da costa et al 2015 karavaiko et al 2005 holanda and johnson 2020 reported that alicyclobacillus tolerans can grow both heterotrophically and autotrophically on fe2 hence in period 6 in which the organic matter was excluded from the feed alicyclobacillus tolerans was sustained but with a decreased relative quantity compared to the previous periods 3 7 co precipitation of iron and arsenic as biogenic schwertmannite co precipitation of as and fe as schwertmannite is favored by ph ranging from 2 8 to 4 5 wang et al 2006a the schwertmannite formation is represented by the following reaction hedrich and johnson 2012 r 9 8fe3 so4 2 14h2o fe8o8 oh 6 so4 22h in period 2 the permeate contained 250 mg l fe and 25 mg l as and fe as ratio of 10 the ph effects on the co precipitation performance was investigated the ph was adjusted to 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 in parallel batch tests and the soluble fe and as concentrations were as given in fig 8 the initial as concentration was around 27 mg l and decreased to 10 7 0 82 0 5 and 0 25 mg l at ph of 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 respectively hence as removal efficiency was only 60 at ph 3 0 and increased to 97 at ph 3 5 further increasing the ph increased the removal performance even to 99 at ph 4 5 the ph 3 5 however may be considered optimal the total fe concentration in the permeate period 2 was around 260 mg l and it decreased to 181 2 52 0 34 and 1 21 mg l at ph of 3 0 3 5 4 0 and 4 5 respectively hence at ph 3 5 quite high fe removal efficiency was also attained at ph 3 0 only 30 fe precipitated which may have resulted in partial as removal at ph 3 0 in periods 5 and 6 the similar experiment was also conducted at ph 3 5 and 4 0 and at initial fe as ratio of 30 fe precipitations were similar with the total fe concentrations of 3 7 mg l at ph 3 5 in both periods the total fe concentrations decreased to around 1 44 and 0 93 at ph 4 0 in periods 5 and 6 respectively as in the permeate decreased to around 0 5 and 0 09 mg l at ph 3 5 in periods 5 and 6 respectively when the ph was increased to 4 0 the permeate as concentrations decreased to 0 37 and 0 07 mg l in respective order fig 8 hence co precipitation of fe and as with biogenic schwertmannite production at ph 3 5 results in 98 99 removals of fe and as similarly ahoranta et al 2016 reported as removal at ph 3 0 as high as 99 5 corresponding to a total as concentration of 0 03 mg l in the effluent of settling tank integrated to a fbr the higher removal at ph 3 0 in the study of ahoranta et al 2016 compared to the present study was likely due to much higher fe2 concentration 5 g l used the other metals remained in solution during the schwertmannite precipitation as expected due to relatively low ph data not shown hence sulfidogenic anaerobic processes may be used as down stream process to recover valuable metals bayrakdar et al 2009 after schwertmannite precipitation 4 conclusions the cmbr performance for the fe2 oxidation in a synthetic amd was revealed at varying fe2 loadings 0 25 3 0 g l d and in the presence and absence of tsb with the following conclusions 98 99 of iron oxidation is obtained in cmbr the metal mixture supplementation decreases the specific fe2 oxidation rate from 0 76 to 0 47 mg fe2 g vss min the specific fe2 oxidation rate up to 6 3 mg fe2 g vss min can be obtained whilst the removal of tsb from the feed decreases the rate by 62 to 2 4 mg fe2 g vss min 99 selective co precipitation of as and fe associated with schwertmannite precipitation is triggered by controlling ph to 3 5 4 0 with naoh sustainable membrane filtration of up to 5 0 lmh is achieved by regular backwash without long term chemical cleaning alicyclobacillus tolerans and acidiphilium cryptum dominate the mixed culture acidiphilium cryptum an obligate heterotroph is almost eliminated from the mixed culture when the bioreactor is fed with organic free media

16846,harmful algal bloom hab is one of the most globally severe challenges in ecological system and water safety hydrogen peroxide has been commonly used in the management treatment solid oxidants e g peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds may outperform liquid h2o2 due to ease in transportation handling and applications however the information on applications of pms and pds in algae treatment is limited in this study the two solid peroxides and h2o2 were investigated for the removal of the blue green algae of microcystis aeruginosa h2o2 and pms effectively removed algae in 2 d at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 while pds was only effective at ph 5 0 the change in ph and the release of dissolved organic carbon were insignificant at 0 2 mm h2o2 and pms the pms could degrade microcystin lr and phycobiliproteins the studies of phycobiliproteins degradation and scanning electron microscopy indicated that pms might cause the cell inactivation mainly by damaging the chemical components in algae cell wall and membrane while h2o2 might mainly enter the cell to form oxidation pressure to kill algae the scavenger experiments showed that radicals were not crucial in h2o2 and pds applications similarly the algae removal by pms was obtained mainly by non radical pathways about 77 was direct pms oxidation and no more than 3 was singlet oxygen mediated process while radical pathways of sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical accounted for 18 and 2 respectively for the realistic algae contaminated natural water the pms effectively lasted for 60 d while the h2o2 lasted for 12 d this research work demonstrates that the pms is promising in control of hab the findings can provide some useful design and application parameters of pms technology for better management treatment

introduction harmful algal bloom hab is a global threat to water supply human health and ecological system huisman et al 2018 kerney et al 2011 qi et al 2020 it is defined as the situation where the

adverse effects on biodiversity montemezzani et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 physical technologies such as mechanical salvage ultrasonic treatment coagulation and membrane

qi et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 environmentally friendly and cost effective chemicals are of great importance in the applications of algaecides peroxide of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has always been considered as a desirable green chemical because of its two side products of h2o and o2 campos martin et al 2006 direct addition of h2o2 or the combination of h2o2 with tio2 has widely been investigated for algal management treatment due to the oxidation ability of h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh with a strong standard redox potential e 0 oh oh of 2 73 v barrington and ghadouani 2008 huo et al 2015 however the low uv ratio only 5 in the sunlight spectrum and the weak absorbance of h2o2 cause the low efficiency for the field applications chang et al 2018 on the other hand the concentrated h2o2 is explosive under extremely strict management control and difficult in the transportation the addition of photocatalysts may cause another problem due to the possible toxicity of catalytic particles toward human therefore the liquid h2o2 has its great limitation in the hab control existing as solid salts peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds are mono or binary substituted derivatives of h2o2 with one or two so3 groups scheme s1 the possible end products of pms and pds are so4 2 h2o or o2 making them desirable for water treatment they have become viable

realistic algae rich water were conducted through this study we hope to obtain better peroxide s for the algal control understand the treatment mechanisms and gain information on the side effects of peroxides the outcome of research was anticipated to provide the key information in the design and operation parameters of persulfate based technology for hab removal 2 materials and methods 2 1

medium and flasks were autoclaved and disinfected before use then desired algae and chemicals were added stepwise samples used for analysis were taken out at fixed intervals algal toxin of microcystin lr mc lr is one of the most widespread cyanotoxins that have severe adverse impacts on drinking water he et al 2015 munoz et al 2020 to investigate the role of different peroxides in mc lr removal extracellular and intercellular exudates were used text s1 all the aforementioned experiments were conducted in 100 ml conical flasks using simulated algal suspension with a total volume of 50 ml and duplicate samples were collected the experimental studies were conducted on a rack equipped with a 40 w lamp for household use and fixed at 10 cm above the flasks the lamp as a light source was used for the photosynthesis process of algae growth in the algae removal experiments and worked to provide a consistent circumstance with the algae growth regarding the mc lr involved experiments the lamp kept being on during the whole process in order that the algae can quickly response after the addition of chemicals in order to test the removal performance of different peroxides on realistic water situation green algae contaminated water fig s2a was sampled from a reservoir at noon on a sunny day some parameters of the water were listed in table s2 the initial water ph was alkaline with a value around 9 0 which might be caused by the photosynthetic activity of algae growth and the consumption of inorganic carbon ic hco3 wallace et al 2016 high concentration of algae species can be observed from the cytometer result fig s2b the raw water was stored in a cold room at 4 c the conical flasks with a volume of 250 ml were placed in the same incubator for the lab algae culture and samples volume of 100 ml was used the light on off cycle was controlled at 18 h and 6 h respectively duplicate experiments were carried out for each peroxide 2 4 analytic methods for the determination of change in algae cell number at different sampling intervals the sample suspensions of 1 ml each were taken after being filtered through 60 μm filter mesh then 10 μl fluorescence beads with 100 times diluted by the ultrapure water were added after mixing the algae sample and the beads by a vortex the cell concentration in cell numbers ml was determined by a flow cytometer cytoflex s beckman coulter usa according to the known added beads amount about 4 73 105 beads ml the equipment setting parameter called as total events in per second should be lower than 1000 for the algae test in the reservoir water 10 μl fluorescence beads with a 500 times dilution were used as reference because the algae number in such water was much less the flow cytometer was equipped with two laser beams at 488 nm blue and 638 nm red according to the references esperanza et al 2019 mao et al 2020 the microalgae population was characterized by the fluorescence method a forward light scatter fs was used to estimate the cell size by which the estimation of damaged cells is excluded more details could be found in text s2 noted that the treatment results in this paper are presented in c c 0 where c 0 and c

the carbon and nitrogen change in different systems the samples suspensions were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane and then the doc and tn were analyzed the change in phosphate concentration was determined by a colorimetric method with the formation of blue phospho antimonyl molybdenum complex at 700 nm sjösten and blomqvist 1997 zhou et al 2012 h2o2 and pms were both measured by a colorimetric method detailed in text s4 bader et al 1988 gokulakrishnan et al 2016 the morphology of algae was analyzed by the scanning electron morphology sem jeol japan and the field emission scanning electron morphology fesem jsm 7610f jeol japan before the analysis the algae were pretreated following the protocol in text s5 to keep the cell integrity 3 results and discussion 3 1 algae cell removal by h2o2 pms and pds the three peroxides under different conditions were used for the removal of algae figs 1 a and b show that at initial ph 7 0 the efficiencies of algae removal through cell rupture by h2o2 and pms increased as the concentrations increased from 0 05 to 0 4 mm the pms outperformed the h2o2 at the same concentrations the effect of 0 05 mm h2o2 on algae removal was almost the same as that of 0 1 mm h2o2 and algae started to regrow only after 48 h while the algae were killed by 0 05 and 0 1 m pms which lasted for 72 120 h at 0 2 and 0 4 mm pms concentration the algae removal efficiency of 99 99 was achieved at contact time of 48 and 24 h respectively comparison of figs 1a with 1b shows that it took a shorter time for pms in the algae removal than h2o2 for instance at the same removal of 99 99 the contact time was 96 h for 0 4 mm h2o2 while that was only 24 h for 0 4 mm pms figs 1a and b demonstrate that after being exposed to 0 2 mm h2o2 for 192 h the algae concentration was about 8 of initial one indicating the regrowth of algae on the other hand the algae cell number at 0 2 or 0 4 mm pms was negligible below 0 01 of the initial value which might be due to the higher reactivity of pms than h2o2 betterton and hoffmann 1990 higher degradation kinetics of pms further confirmed its higher reactivity than h2o2 as shown in fig s3 fig 1b shows that the pds with initial concentrations of 0 05 to 0 4 mm failed to inhibit the algal growth at initial ph 7 0 this finding was consistent with the phosphorus consumption illustrated in fig s4 which showed the decrease in phosphorus in both control and pds dosed suspensions due to the algae growth consumption on the contrary the phosphorus concentration in the pms dosed suspensions was unchanged indicating no algae growth and thus no consumption of phosphorous in order to find out the influence of ph on the treatment two experiments were conducted at initial ph 5 0 and 9 0 as shown in fig 1c at initial ph 5 0 the pms exhibited a rapid removal for algae which was completed at the contact time of 4 h on the other hand the algae concentrations started to decrease after 24 and 48 h when pds or h2o2 was used which might be caused by the resistance from the mucilage attached to the algae cell huo et al 2015 fig 1d shows that both pms and h2o2 could effectively remove the algae at an initial ph 9 0 in contrast the pds was ineffective in the treatment similar to the finding given in fig 1b as shown in fig s5 the algae containing water without addition of peroxides control turned alkaline around 9 5 due to the co2 consumption by the massive reproduction of algae wallace et al 2016 for the algae containing water that was exposed to pds except at initial ph 5 0 the final ph values all increased to alkaline levels due to the same reasons algae growth the ph decreased after the addition of pms or h2o2 to the algae containing suspension the degree in the ph reduction was greater in the pms dosed suspension than h2o2 the ph reduction might be due to a few reasons when the algae cells were inhibited more acidic carbonate or bicarbonate species became available leading to the reduction in the ph the compositions of pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 can lead to more hydrogen ions h in the solution as a result the ph in the suspension decreased at initial ph 7 0 or 9 0 and with the 0 2 mm pms dosage the final ph became 6 0 to 7 0 and was still within the acceptable ph range of the common natural water environment of 6 0 9 0 brezonik and arnold 2011 h2o2 is effective in algae control regardless of initial ph of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 which is consistent with the reported findings barrington and ghadouani 2008 barroin and feuillade 1986 chang et al 2018 the pms is more efficient to inhibit the algae growth than h2o2 and the ph after the treatment is still within the regulated range on the other hand pds only inhibits the algae growth at initial ph 5 0 all these results clearly demonstrate that pms is more efficient and suitable in algae removal than h2o2 and pds 3 2 analysis of doc cell phycobiliproteins and morphology change doc is a key indicator of water quality in evaluation of algal organic matter aom fig 2 shows that the doc in algae suspensions after being exposed to h2o2 and pms was similar at initial ph 5 0 7 0 or much lower at ph 9 0 compared with that of the control this indicates that the use of h2o2 and pms did not cause severe release of organic matters even though the algae growth was greatly inhibited the doc trend in the h2o2 dosed suspension was consistent with the finding reported peterson et al 1995 the organic pigments of pc ap and pe with basic polypeptides structure are major light harvesting and energy transfer accessories for algae photosynthesis arteni et al 2008 marsac and houmard 1988 they are usually attached to the cytoplasmic surface and play significant roles in algae growth and reproduction the three proteins in pds dosed suspension were similar to the control while h2o2 and pms caused distinct decreases in contents of proteins figs s6a c due to the cell damage which was in agreement with the finding shown in fig 1 the decrease in the contents of proteins may be caused by the oxidation role of h2o2 and pms in algae cells huo et al 2015 ruiz et al 2019 this causes the aggregation of ruptured cells and the subsequent settling due to the complexation role of metals in damaged cells with the aom especially released proteins jia et al 2018 dolejs 1993 pivokonsky et al 2006 tsai et al 2019 the cell morphology was studied to find out the change in cell surfaces fig 3 shows many intensive and intact microsphere cells with an average diameter of 1 5 2 0 μm in the algae growth process in the absence of peroxides after being exposed to three peroxides for 24 h at initial ph 5 0 fewer intact algae cells could be seen together with some aggregated flocks the green marked squares which indicated the complexation process compared with the algae cells exposed to h2o2 and pds more deformed cells with very rough surfaces were found in the pms dosed water the cells after being exposed to pms were destroyed and aggregated matters were formed on the surface while no such rough membranes were seen in the h2o2 and pds water indicating the different change in the cell morphology after algae being treated by pms h2o2 and pds at initial ph 7 0 many aggregated flocks could be found in h2o2 and pms solutions fig s7 like the morphology change observed in fig 3 more intact cells exist after the algae being exposed to h2o2 while the cells with the surface damaged and rough membranes are observed in pms case in contrast the algae cells were in intact microsphere shapes in the pds case fig s7 which indicated the substantial growth of algae even after the pds addition in order to better observe the change in cell morphology the fesem was further used fig s8 shows that the algae cell surface was severely damaged in pms case while in h2o2 and pds cases lots of intact cells could be observed and few cells with surface damaged were found the damaged surface made the dead algae cells more aggregated the fesem results further demonstrate that pms might damage the surface of algae cells while h2o2 and pds showed little damage to the algae cell surface in order to provide the evidence that pms could directly react with the chemical components in cell surface the uv vis spectra of cellular extracts after being exposed to different peroxides were measured fig s9 the cellular extracts include many organics such as proteins lipids polysaccharides etc which are also the main components of cell membranes arteni et al 2008 henderson et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2006 as shown in fig s9 pms could effectively react with the extracts and decrease the absorbance peak around 620 nm regardless of the initial solution ph values h2o2 and pds acted similarly and could both slightly decrease the peak absorbance at ph 5 0 but the degradation became much slower at initial ph of 7 0 the peak value decrease efficiency was much higher by pms compared with h2o2 and pds indicating the stronger reactivity of pms with cellular components which was consistent with its faster algae removal performance the peak absorbance in the range of 500 700 nm were mainly attributed to the absorbance of algae proteins marsac and houmard 1988 the results in fig s9 clearly demonstrate that pms could damage the proteins in algae cells 3 3 mc lr release and degradation the toxin release of mc lr was studied with the recommended value of 1 μg l as the reference figs 4 a c show that h2o2 causes severer release in mc lr of 18 μg l much higher than control and other two peroxides this is in agreement with the reported finding that substantial mc lr was released after the algae being treated by h2o2 for 6 h zhang et al 2019 the very limited release in the mc lr less than 1 μg l at initial ph 5 0 was observed in fig 4a when pms or pds were used probably due to the higher reactivity of persulfates such secondary contamination was much less than that caused by h2o2 fig 4b show that the release of mc lr at ph 7 0 in the pds treated water was similar to that in the control that of pms at ph 7 0 and 9 0 was less or similar to the control the finding in the pds treated water was expected as it did not have an inhibition effect on algae growth figs 1b and d at ph 7 0 and 9 0 after the pds was added the concentration of algae cells increased like the control figs 1b and d therefore the mc lr release in the pds treated water was similar to the control indicating no thermometric reaction between pds and mc lr this is probably the fact that ph plays a crucial role in the reactivity of pds consistent with the report that pds shows lower degradation efficiencies for contaminants at ph 9 0 to 11 0 guan et al 2011 since algae cells were severely damaged by pms the release in mc lr with higher content should occur just like that in the h2o2 treated water however the mc lr release in the pms dosed water was not enhanced indicating the possibility of mc lr degradation by the pms the decomposition of mc lr by the peroxides was experimentally studied in the algae extracellular exudates and intracellular extracts fig 4d shows that the mc lr in extracellular exudates was degraded by 50 in 3 h by pms from initial 30 μg l while h2o2 and pds had negligible mc lr removal compared with the control on the other hand the mc lr in algae intracellular extracts that contain high content aom released from the ruptured cells would gradually be degraded only by pms table 1 the mc lr degradation is consistent with the reported finding that 1 μm mc lr at ph 7 4 was completely degraded by pms that had a concentration of 50 μm and 1 mm pds and h2o2 caused much lower mc lr degradation he et al 2015 additionally the coexisting proteins of pc ap and pe decreased dramatically with the addition of pms table 1 while a little difference from the control could be found in h2o2 and pds dosed water after 24 h this result further indicates that pms can degrade not only mc lr but also the protein components in the algae on the other hand both h2o2 and pds could not 3 4 mechanism analysis 3 4 1 cell rupture pms pds and h2o2 all have the o o bond however they behaved quite differently the pms shows the best performance among them when treating algae and their corresponding organic exudates figs 1 and 4 and table 1 which is inconsistent with the redox potentials e 0 s2o8 2 so4 2 2 01 v e 0 hso5 hso4 1 84 v e 0 h2o2 h2o 1 76 v chen et al 2019 this might be stemmed from their different structures scheme s1 pms pds and h2o2 exist as hso5 s2o8 2 and h2o2 in this study since their pka values are 9 4 3 5 and 11 6 respectively chen et al 2019 pms possesses an asymmetrical structure with a partial electron charge distribution in o o bond while pds and h2o2 are symmetrical lee et al 2020 terminal o in o o bond enables the pms to be prone to initiate direct oxidation to nucleophiles through oxygen atom transfer to form oxygen adducts and so4 2 bienert et al 2007 lee et al 2020 ruiz et al 2019 therefore pms was degraded much faster than h2o2 under similar conditions fig s3 meanwhile the selective oxidation ability of pds and h2o2 to organics was much weaker than pms due to the steric hindrance caused by the presence of two symmetrical so3 or h groups scheme s1 lee et al 2020 therefore pms exhibited a strong mc lr and proteins degradation ability while pds and h2o2 did not pms reportedly reacted rapidly with such organic matters as amino acids ketones aldehydes carboxylic acids and arenes lee et al 2020 ramachandran ms 1986 ruiz et al 2019 yang et al 2018 zhu and ford 1991 aom and cell membranes are composed of lipids carbohydrates and proteins arteni et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2006 which contain several chemical bonds of amine groups ketone and carboxylic groups or unsaturated bonds thus pms might directly destroy the algae cell membranes which likely caused the cell shape deformation and aggregated matters shown in figs 3 s7 and s8 and table 1 unlike pms the weak reactivity of h2o2 and pds to organics did not cause the deformed and rough cell surfaces with aggregated matters figs 3 s7 and s8 and they could only slightly degrade the cellular components fig s9 in contrast it is widely reported that h2o2 can enter the cell through the algae cell wall and membrane channeled by selected aquaporin homologues bienert et al 2007 bienert et al 2006 henzler and steudle 2000 zhang et al 2019 resulting in the internal damage by forming oxidative stress or affecting photosynthesis process according to the literatures chang et al 2018 the algae photosynthesis process was inhibited by h2o2 due to its ability to impair electron transfer and oxygen evolution samuilov et al 2004 like h2o2 at initial ph 5 0 pds might enter cell due to their similar symmetrical structure and sem results figs 3 and s8 at ph 5 0 the disappeared efficiency in pds system figs 1b and 1d might be caused by the dominated competitive reactions of pds with other matters in medium such as the aom rather than algae due to the strong impact of ph on pds effectiveness guan et al 2011 3 4 2 reactive species it is well known that radical species of oh or so4 can be generated through the o o bond break in h2o2 and persulfates mediated processes lee et al 2020 wacławek et al 2017 besides radicals nonradical of singlet oxygen 1o2 might be involved in the persulfate decomposition betterton and hoffmann 1990 lee et al 2020 the possible reactive species were studied by several scavengers given in table 2 oh can react with ipa tba and ffa at a rate of 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 5 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 while so4 reacts with ipa and tba at a rate of 8 2 107 m 1 s 1 and 8 4 105 m 1 s 1 respectively wu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 1o2 can react with ffa at a rate of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2018 the ipa tba and ffa can therefore be used to identify the role of reactive species as shown in table 2 the presence of alcohols ipa tba and ffa exerted no influence on the algae change in the first 6 h and only around 24 h the algae growth was inhibited by alcohols the reactive species were mainly analyzed according to the data in the first 6 h no obvious algae numbers change was found in h2o2 system after addition of alcohols for 6 h or 24 h indicating that oh or 1o2 was less crucial in algae damage by h2o2 the algae rupture should be directly induced by the oxidation role of molecular h2o2 this is different from the reported finding that oh was responsible for algae removal in the h2o2 system chang et al 2018 huo et al 2015 the different mechanism might partially be due to the much higher cell density in this research 0 93 1 02 107 cells ml than that in the reference 5 104 cells ml chang et al 2018 furthermore the lamps used for the algae culture in this study were common household ones no uv light is emitted and it is impossible to activate h2o2 directly since h2o2 only absorbs light in the uv area 400 nm chen et al 2019 likewise the change in algae cell content in the pds dosed water after the addition of alcohols did not show too much difference from the control after 6 h indicating the insignificant roles of the reactive species table 2 shows that the addition of alcohols in pms system causes inhibition on algae removal after 6 h which is different from the h2o2 or pds dosed water the ipa can simultaneously scavenge oh and so4 the nonradical reaction pathways accounted for around 80 100 19 44 in the algae rupture process while the radical pathways were only around 20 the tba results demonstrate that the dominant radical is so4 about 18 and the oh might play a 2 proportion in algae rupture due to the weaker reaction constant of tba with so4 than oh if oh dominates the radical pathways the alcohols namely ipa tba and ffa would behave the similar algae removal results for the possible role of 1o2 the addition of ffa exhibited 3 3 65 0 71 of algae cells inhibition compared with the control even though ffa is able to react with pms at a rate of 0 059 0 004 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2018 the algae cells could still be removed by about 97 in 6 h and almost totally removed only 0 09 0 02 left in 24 h which were much higher than the blank sample with ffa even though ffa reacted with pms its reaction rate should be much lower than the reaction between pms and algae matters therefore 1o2 might account for a very minor role in the removal 3 65 0 71 3 due to the inhibition effect of ffa while the proportion of direct algae damage by pms is about 77 in the amino acids oxidation by pms 1o2 was not considered as the principal reactive species while the direct oxidation played the major role which was consistent as reported ruiz et al 2019 the direct pms oxidation dominated process with minor formation of reactive species such as 1o2 were confirmed in several studies on the organics decomposition ramachandran et al 1986 yang et al 2018 zhu and ford 1991 3 5 performance in algae contaminated reservoir water and preliminary cost analysis in order to investigate the feasibility of peroxides for industrial applications algae contaminated water samples fig s2 taken from a reservoir were tested as shown in figs 5 a and s10 the algae were effectively removed in 48 h after h2o2 or pms was dosed however the effect from pds on the removal was negligible though h2o2 could effectively remove algae initially the re growth of algae was seen after 288 h 12 d different from h2o2 the content of algae exposed to pms was kept at a very low level and the sample was still very clear even after 60 d exposure fig s10 this clearly indicates that pms is more efficient in algae removal than h2o2 fig 5b demonstrates that the final ph in the algae suspension dosed with h2o2 or pms is almost the same as the control the doc was just slightly higher than the control meaning that the pms would not result in serious secondary contamination furthermore the preliminary cost analysis was conducted with an assumption of application of the 0 2 mm peroxides in treating algae water as shown in table s4 pds is the most expensive among the chemicals studied if one considers the cost based on the unit price since pds was only effective at ph 5 0 fig 1 while the ph of natural water environment ranges between 6 0 and 9 0 pds is obviously not suitable for algae contaminated water treatment even though the unit price usd ton of h2o2 for algae control is about 15 times lower than that of pms the per day cost usd ton d of pms 1 7 2 1 is only about 3 times higher than that of h2o2 0 6 0 7 it is worthy pointing out that the strict storage the transport and the handling of h2o2 will pose higher extra costs which is not considered here more importantly use of pms can decrease the released toxins by algae while h2o2 cannot as aforementioned it is therefore concluded that pms is the most cost effective peroxide for algae contaminated water management treatment on the approach for applying the pms in algae contaminated water a spreader such as a water harrow device might be used to disperse the pms chemicals into the water as suggested in the literatures matthijs et al 2012 4 conclusions rapid growth of algae specially microcystis aeruginosa is giving rise to more and more serious issues on water environment and ecological system this study investigated the direct use of h2o2 pms and pds without external addition of activators in algae removal in simulated and natural surface waters though possessing the same o o group the three peroxides exhibited quite different behaviors and mechanisms in algae treatment with a small dosage of 0 2 mm pms and h2o2 were able to inhibit the algae growth with negligible change in ph and limited doc release however a very weak efficiency for the removal was found when pds was used due to the asymmetric structure pms had the ability to directly degrade mc lr and pigments proteins while other peroxides could not the killing of algae is achieved via different mechanisms for h2o2 it was done via entering algae cell while for pms it was done via changes in the proteins in cell membranes a direct oxidation pathway of algae inactivation by h2o2 instead of oh was proposed for the treatment by pms the direct non radical oxidation pathway 80 and the radical pathway 20 were responsible for algae cell damage when applied in the treatment of algae contaminated water in a reservoir pms well performed longer lasting algae inhibition duration 60 d than h2o2 12 d though pms has been used in removal of several organic compounds with success its direct application in algae has yet to be proposed and documented our research work reported here demonstrates that pms is the most promising peroxide for algae removal with a high efficiency and negligible release of toxins besides removing algae cells pms had the ability to degrade the toxic algal exudates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16846,harmful algal bloom hab is one of the most globally severe challenges in ecological system and water safety hydrogen peroxide has been commonly used in the management treatment solid oxidants e g peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds may outperform liquid h2o2 due to ease in transportation handling and applications however the information on applications of pms and pds in algae treatment is limited in this study the two solid peroxides and h2o2 were investigated for the removal of the blue green algae of microcystis aeruginosa h2o2 and pms effectively removed algae in 2 d at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 while pds was only effective at ph 5 0 the change in ph and the release of dissolved organic carbon were insignificant at 0 2 mm h2o2 and pms the pms could degrade microcystin lr and phycobiliproteins the studies of phycobiliproteins degradation and scanning electron microscopy indicated that pms might cause the cell inactivation mainly by damaging the chemical components in algae cell wall and membrane while h2o2 might mainly enter the cell to form oxidation pressure to kill algae the scavenger experiments showed that radicals were not crucial in h2o2 and pds applications similarly the algae removal by pms was obtained mainly by non radical pathways about 77 was direct pms oxidation and no more than 3 was singlet oxygen mediated process while radical pathways of sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical accounted for 18 and 2 respectively for the realistic algae contaminated natural water the pms effectively lasted for 60 d while the h2o2 lasted for 12 d this research work demonstrates that the pms is promising in control of hab the findings can provide some useful design and application parameters of pms technology for better management treatment

qi et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 environmentally friendly and cost effective chemicals are of great importance in the applications of algaecides peroxide of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has always been considered as a desirable green chemical because of its two side products of h2o and o2 campos martin et al 2006 direct addition of h2o2 or the combination of h2o2 with tio2 has widely been investigated for algal management treatment due to the oxidation ability of h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh with a strong standard redox potential e 0 oh oh of 2 73 v barrington and ghadouani 2008 huo et al 2015 however the low uv ratio only 5 in the sunlight spectrum and the weak absorbance of h2o2 cause the low efficiency for the field applications chang et al 2018 on the other hand the concentrated h2o2 is explosive under extremely strict management control and difficult in the transportation the addition of photocatalysts may cause another problem due to the possible toxicity of catalytic particles toward human therefore the liquid h2o2 has its great limitation in the hab control existing as solid salts peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds are mono or binary substituted derivatives of h2o2 with one or two so3 groups scheme s1 the possible end products of pms and pds are so4 2 h2o or o2 making them desirable for water treatment they have become viable

lr mc lr is one of the most widespread cyanotoxins that have severe adverse impacts on drinking water he et al 2015 munoz et al 2020 to investigate the role of different peroxides in mc lr removal extracellular and intercellular exudates were used text s1 all the aforementioned experiments were conducted in 100 ml conical flasks using simulated algal suspension with a total volume of 50 ml and duplicate samples were collected the experimental studies were conducted on a rack equipped with a 40 w lamp for household use and fixed at 10 cm above the flasks the lamp as a light source was used for the photosynthesis process of algae growth in the algae removal experiments and worked to provide a consistent circumstance with the algae growth regarding the mc lr involved experiments the lamp kept being on during the whole process in order that the algae can quickly response after the addition of chemicals in order to test the removal performance of different peroxides on realistic water situation green algae contaminated water fig s2a was sampled from a reservoir at noon on a sunny day some parameters of the water were listed in table s2 the initial water ph was alkaline with a value around 9 0 which might be caused by the photosynthetic activity of algae growth and the consumption of inorganic carbon ic hco3 wallace et al 2016 high concentration of algae species can be observed

colorimetric method detailed in text s4 bader et al 1988 gokulakrishnan et al 2016 the morphology of algae was analyzed by the scanning electron morphology sem jeol japan and the field emission scanning electron morphology fesem jsm 7610f jeol japan before the analysis the algae were pretreated following the protocol in text s5 to keep the cell integrity 3 results and discussion 3 1 algae cell removal by h2o2 pms and pds the three peroxides under different conditions were used for the removal of algae figs 1 a and b show that at initial ph 7 0 the efficiencies of algae removal through cell rupture by h2o2 and pms increased as the concentrations increased from 0 05 to 0 4 mm the pms outperformed the h2o2 at the same concentrations the effect of 0 05 mm h2o2 on algae removal was almost the same as that of 0 1 mm h2o2 and algae started to regrow only after 48 h while the algae were killed by 0 05 and 0 1 m pms which lasted for 72 120 h at 0 2 and 0 4 mm pms concentration the algae removal efficiency of 99 99 was achieved at contact time of 48 and 24 h respectively comparison of figs 1a with 1b shows that it took a shorter time for pms in the algae removal than h2o2 for instance at the same removal of 99 99 the contact time was 96 h for 0 4 mm h2o2 while that was only 24 h for 0 4 mm pms figs 1a and b demonstrate that after being exposed to 0 2 mm h2o2 for 192 h the algae concentration was about 8 of initial one indicating the regrowth of algae on the other hand the algae cell number at 0 2 or 0 4 mm pms was negligible below 0 01 of the initial value which might be due to the higher reactivity of pms than h2o2 betterton and hoffmann 1990 higher degradation kinetics of pms further confirmed its higher reactivity than h2o2 as shown in fig s3 fig 1b shows that the pds with initial concentrations of 0 05 to 0 4 mm failed to inhibit the algal growth at initial ph 7 0 this finding was consistent with the phosphorus consumption illustrated in fig s4 which showed the decrease in phosphorus in both control and pds dosed suspensions due to the algae growth consumption on the contrary the phosphorus concentration in the pms dosed suspensions was unchanged indicating no algae growth and thus no consumption of phosphorous in order to find out the influence of ph on the treatment two experiments were conducted at initial ph 5 0 and 9 0 as shown in fig 1c at initial ph 5 0 the pms exhibited a rapid removal for algae which was completed at the contact time of 4 h on the other hand the algae concentrations started to decrease after 24 and 48 h when pds or h2o2 was used which might be caused by the resistance from the mucilage attached to the algae cell huo et al 2015 fig 1d shows that both pms and h2o2 could effectively remove the algae at an initial ph 9 0 in contrast the pds was ineffective in the treatment similar to the finding given in fig 1b as shown in fig s5 the algae containing water without addition of peroxides control turned alkaline around 9 5 due to the co2 consumption by the massive reproduction of algae wallace et al 2016 for the algae containing water that was exposed to pds except at initial ph 5 0 the final ph values all increased to alkaline levels due to the same reasons algae growth the ph decreased after the addition of pms or h2o2 to the algae containing suspension the degree in the ph reduction was greater in the pms dosed suspension than h2o2 the ph reduction might be due to a few reasons when the algae cells were inhibited more acidic carbonate or bicarbonate species became available leading to the reduction in the ph the compositions of pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 can lead to more hydrogen ions h in the solution as a result the ph in the suspension decreased at initial ph 7 0 or 9 0 and with the 0 2 mm pms dosage the final ph became 6 0 to 7 0 and was still within the acceptable ph range of the common natural water environment of 6 0 9 0 brezonik and arnold 2011 h2o2 is effective in algae control regardless of initial ph of 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 which is consistent with the reported findings barrington and ghadouani 2008 barroin and feuillade 1986 chang et al 2018 the pms is more efficient to inhibit the algae growth than h2o2 and the ph after the treatment is still within the regulated range on the other hand pds only inhibits the algae growth at initial ph 5 0 all these results clearly demonstrate that pms is more efficient and suitable in algae removal than h2o2 and pds 3 2 analysis of doc cell phycobiliproteins and morphology change doc is a key indicator of water quality in evaluation of algal organic matter aom fig 2 shows that the doc in algae suspensions after being exposed to h2o2 and pms was similar at initial ph 5 0 7 0 or much lower at ph 9 0 compared with that of the control this indicates that the use of h2o2 and pms did not cause severe release of organic matters even though the algae growth was greatly inhibited the doc trend in the h2o2 dosed suspension was consistent with the finding reported peterson et al 1995 the organic pigments of pc ap and pe with basic polypeptides structure are major light harvesting and energy transfer accessories for algae photosynthesis arteni et al 2008 marsac and houmard 1988 they are usually attached to the cytoplasmic surface and play significant roles in algae growth and reproduction the three proteins in pds dosed suspension were similar to the control while h2o2 and pms caused distinct decreases in contents of proteins figs s6a c due to the cell damage which was in agreement with the finding shown in fig 1 the decrease in the contents of proteins may be caused by the oxidation role of h2o2 and pms in algae cells huo et al 2015 ruiz et al 2019 this causes the aggregation of ruptured cells and the subsequent settling due to the complexation role of metals in damaged cells with the aom especially released proteins jia et al 2018 dolejs 1993 pivokonsky et al 2006 tsai et al 2019 the cell morphology was studied to find out the change in cell surfaces fig 3 shows many intensive and intact microsphere cells with an average diameter of 1 5 2 0 μm in the algae growth process in the absence of peroxides after being exposed to three peroxides for 24 h at initial ph 5 0 fewer intact algae cells could be seen together with some aggregated flocks the green marked squares which indicated the complexation process compared with the algae cells exposed to h2o2 and pds more deformed cells with very rough surfaces were found in the pms dosed water the cells after being exposed to pms were destroyed and aggregated matters were formed on the surface while no such rough membranes were seen in the h2o2 and pds water indicating the different change in the cell morphology after algae being treated by pms h2o2 and pds at initial ph 7 0 many aggregated flocks could be found in h2o2 and pms solutions fig s7 like the morphology change observed in fig 3 more intact cells exist after the algae being exposed to h2o2 while the cells with the surface damaged and rough membranes are observed in pms case in contrast the algae cells were in intact microsphere shapes in the pds case fig s7 which indicated the substantial growth of algae even after the pds addition in order to better observe the change in cell morphology the fesem was further used fig s8 shows that the algae cell surface was severely damaged in pms case while in h2o2 and pds cases lots of intact cells could be observed and few cells with surface damaged were found the damaged surface made the dead algae cells more aggregated the fesem results further demonstrate that pms might damage the surface of algae cells while h2o2 and pds showed little damage to the algae cell surface in order to provide the evidence that pms could directly react with the chemical components in cell surface the uv vis spectra of cellular extracts after being exposed to different peroxides were measured fig s9 the cellular extracts include many organics such as proteins lipids polysaccharides etc which are also the main components of cell membranes arteni et al 2008 henderson et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2006 as shown in fig s9 pms could effectively react with the extracts and decrease the absorbance peak around 620 nm regardless of the initial solution ph values h2o2 and pds acted similarly and could both slightly decrease the peak absorbance at ph 5 0 but the degradation became much slower at initial ph of 7 0 the peak value decrease efficiency was much higher by pms compared with h2o2 and pds indicating the stronger reactivity of pms with cellular components which was consistent with its faster algae removal performance the peak absorbance in the range of 500 700 nm were mainly attributed to the absorbance of algae proteins marsac and houmard 1988 the results in fig s9 clearly demonstrate that pms could damage the proteins in algae cells 3 3 mc lr release and degradation the toxin release of mc lr was studied with the recommended value of 1 μg l as the reference figs 4 a c show that h2o2 causes severer release in mc lr of 18 μg l much higher than control and other two peroxides this is in agreement with the reported finding that substantial mc lr was released after the algae being treated by h2o2 for 6 h zhang et al 2019 the very limited release in the mc lr less than 1 μg l at initial ph 5 0 was observed in fig 4a when pms or pds were used probably due to the higher reactivity of persulfates such secondary contamination was much less than that caused by h2o2 fig 4b show that the release of mc lr at ph 7 0 in the pds treated water was similar to that in the control that of pms at ph 7 0 and 9 0 was less or similar to the control the finding in the pds treated water was expected as it did not have an inhibition effect on algae growth figs 1b and d at ph 7 0 and 9 0 after the pds was added the concentration of algae cells increased like the control figs 1b and d therefore the mc lr release in the pds treated water was similar to the control indicating no thermometric reaction between pds and mc lr this is probably the fact that ph plays a crucial role in the reactivity of pds consistent with the report that pds shows lower degradation efficiencies for contaminants at ph 9 0 to 11 0 guan et al 2011 since algae cells were severely damaged by pms the release in mc lr with higher content should occur just like that in the h2o2 treated water however the mc lr release in the pms dosed water was not enhanced indicating the possibility of mc lr degradation by the pms the decomposition of mc lr by the peroxides was experimentally studied in the algae extracellular exudates and intracellular extracts fig 4d shows that the mc lr in extracellular exudates was degraded by 50 in 3 h by pms from initial 30 μg l while h2o2 and pds had negligible mc lr removal compared with the control on the other hand the mc lr in algae intracellular extracts that contain high content aom released from the ruptured cells would gradually be degraded only by pms table 1 the mc lr degradation is consistent with the reported finding that 1 μm mc lr at ph 7 4 was completely degraded by pms that had a concentration of 50 μm and 1 mm pds and h2o2 caused much lower mc lr degradation he et al 2015 additionally the coexisting proteins of pc ap and pe decreased dramatically with the addition of pms table 1 while a little difference from the control could be found in h2o2 and pds dosed water after 24 h this result further indicates that pms can degrade not only mc lr but also the protein components in the algae on the other hand both h2o2 and pds could not 3 4 mechanism analysis 3 4 1 cell rupture pms pds and h2o2 all have the o o bond however they behaved quite differently the pms shows the best performance among them when treating algae and their corresponding organic exudates figs 1 and 4 and table 1 which is inconsistent with the redox potentials e 0 s2o8 2 so4 2 2 01 v e 0 hso5 hso4 1 84 v e 0 h2o2 h2o 1 76 v chen et al 2019 this might be stemmed from their different structures scheme s1 pms pds and h2o2 exist as hso5 s2o8 2 and h2o2 in this study since their pka values are 9 4 3 5 and 11 6 respectively chen et al 2019 pms possesses an asymmetrical structure with a partial electron charge distribution in o o bond while pds and h2o2 are symmetrical lee et al 2020 terminal o in o o bond enables the pms to be prone to initiate direct oxidation to nucleophiles through oxygen atom transfer to form oxygen adducts and so4 2 bienert et al 2007 lee et al 2020 ruiz et al 2019 therefore pms was degraded much faster than h2o2 under similar conditions fig s3 meanwhile the selective oxidation ability of pds and h2o2 to organics was much weaker than pms due to the steric hindrance caused by the presence of two symmetrical so3 or h groups scheme s1 lee et al 2020 therefore pms exhibited a strong mc lr and proteins degradation ability while pds and h2o2 did not pms reportedly reacted rapidly with such organic matters as amino acids ketones aldehydes carboxylic acids and arenes lee et al 2020 ramachandran ms 1986 ruiz et al 2019 yang et al 2018 zhu and ford 1991 aom and cell membranes are composed of lipids carbohydrates and proteins arteni et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2006 which contain several chemical bonds of amine groups ketone and carboxylic groups or unsaturated bonds thus pms might directly destroy the algae cell membranes which likely caused the cell shape deformation and aggregated matters shown in figs 3 s7 and s8 and table 1 unlike pms the weak reactivity of h2o2 and pds to organics did not cause the deformed and rough cell surfaces with aggregated matters figs 3 s7 and s8 and they could only slightly degrade the cellular components fig s9 in contrast it is widely reported that h2o2 can enter the cell through the algae cell wall and membrane channeled by selected aquaporin homologues bienert et al 2007 bienert et al 2006 henzler and steudle 2000 zhang et al 2019 resulting in the internal damage by forming oxidative stress or affecting photosynthesis process according to the literatures chang et al 2018 the algae photosynthesis process was inhibited by h2o2 due to its ability to impair electron transfer and oxygen evolution samuilov et al 2004 like h2o2 at initial ph 5 0 pds might enter cell due to their similar symmetrical structure and sem results figs 3 and s8 at ph 5 0 the disappeared efficiency in pds system figs 1b and 1d might be caused by the dominated competitive reactions of pds with other matters in medium such as the aom rather than algae due to the strong impact of ph on pds effectiveness guan et al 2011 3 4 2 reactive species it is well known that radical species of oh or so4 can be generated through the o o bond break in h2o2 and persulfates mediated processes lee et al 2020 wacławek et al 2017 besides radicals nonradical of singlet oxygen 1o2 might be involved in the persulfate decomposition betterton and hoffmann 1990 lee et al 2020 the possible reactive species were studied by several scavengers given in table 2 oh can react with ipa tba and ffa at a rate of 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 5 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 while so4 reacts with ipa and tba at a rate of 8 2 107 m 1 s 1 and 8 4 105 m 1 s 1 respectively wu et al 2015 yang et al 2018 1o2 can react with ffa at a rate of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2018 the ipa tba and ffa can therefore be used to identify the role of reactive species as shown in table 2 the presence of alcohols ipa tba and ffa exerted no influence on the algae change in the first 6 h and only around 24 h the algae growth was inhibited by alcohols the reactive species were mainly analyzed according to the data in the first 6 h no obvious algae numbers change was found in h2o2 system after addition of alcohols for 6 h or 24 h indicating that oh or 1o2 was less crucial in algae damage by h2o2 the algae rupture should be directly induced by the oxidation role of molecular h2o2 this is different from the reported finding that oh was responsible for algae removal in the h2o2 system chang et al 2018 huo et al 2015 the different mechanism might partially be due to the much higher cell density in this research 0 93 1 02 107 cells ml than that in the reference 5 104 cells ml chang et al 2018 furthermore the lamps used for the algae culture in this study were common household ones no uv light is emitted and it is impossible to activate h2o2 directly since h2o2 only absorbs light in the uv area 400 nm chen et al 2019 likewise the change in algae cell content in the pds dosed water after the addition of alcohols did not show too much difference from the control after 6 h indicating the insignificant roles of the reactive species table 2 shows that the addition of alcohols in pms system causes inhibition on algae removal after 6 h which is different from the h2o2 or pds dosed water the ipa can simultaneously scavenge oh and so4 the nonradical reaction pathways accounted for around 80 100 19 44 in the algae rupture process while the radical pathways were only around 20 the tba results demonstrate that the dominant radical is so4 about 18 and the oh might play a 2 proportion in algae rupture due to the weaker reaction constant of tba with so4 than oh if oh dominates the radical pathways the alcohols namely ipa tba and ffa would behave the similar algae removal results for the possible role of 1o2 the addition of ffa exhibited 3 3 65 0 71 of algae cells inhibition compared with the control even though ffa is able to react with pms at a rate of 0 059 0 004 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2018 the algae cells could still be removed by about 97 in 6 h and almost totally removed only 0 09 0 02 left in 24 h which were much higher than the blank sample with ffa even though ffa reacted with pms its reaction rate should be much lower than the reaction between pms and algae matters therefore 1o2 might account for a very minor role in the removal 3 65 0 71 3 due to the inhibition effect of ffa while the proportion of direct algae damage by pms is about 77 in the amino acids oxidation by pms 1o2 was not considered as the principal reactive species while the direct oxidation played the major role which was consistent as reported ruiz et al 2019 the direct pms oxidation dominated process with minor formation of reactive species such as 1o2 were confirmed in several studies on the organics decomposition ramachandran et al 1986 yang et al 2018 zhu and ford 1991 3 5 performance in algae contaminated reservoir water and preliminary cost analysis in order to investigate the feasibility of peroxides for industrial applications algae contaminated water samples fig s2 taken from a reservoir were tested as shown in figs 5 a and s10 the algae were effectively removed in 48 h after h2o2 or pms was dosed however the effect from pds on the removal was negligible though h2o2 could effectively remove algae initially the re growth of algae was seen after 288 h 12 d different from h2o2 the content of algae exposed to pms was kept at a very low level and the sample was still very clear even after 60 d exposure fig s10 this clearly indicates that pms is more efficient in algae removal than h2o2 fig 5b demonstrates that the final ph in the algae suspension dosed with h2o2 or pms is almost the same as the control the doc was just slightly higher than the control meaning that the pms would not result in serious secondary contamination furthermore the preliminary cost analysis was conducted with an assumption of application of the 0 2 mm peroxides in treating algae water as shown in table s4 pds is the most expensive among the chemicals studied if one considers the cost based on the unit price since pds was only effective at ph 5 0 fig 1 while the ph of natural water environment ranges between 6 0 and 9 0 pds is obviously not suitable for algae contaminated water treatment even though the unit price usd ton of h2o2 for algae control is about 15 times lower than that of pms the per day cost usd ton d of pms 1 7 2 1 is only about 3 times higher than that of h2o2 0 6 0 7 it is worthy pointing out that the strict storage the transport and the handling of h2o2 will pose higher extra costs which is not considered here more importantly use of pms can decrease the released toxins by algae while h2o2 cannot as aforementioned it is therefore concluded that pms is the most cost effective peroxide for algae contaminated water management treatment on the approach for applying the pms in algae contaminated water a spreader such as a water harrow device might be used to disperse the pms chemicals into the water as suggested in the literatures matthijs et al 2012 4 conclusions rapid growth of algae specially microcystis aeruginosa is giving rise to more and more serious issues on water environment and ecological system this study investigated the direct use of h2o2 pms and pds without external addition of activators in algae removal in simulated and natural surface waters though possessing the same o o group the three peroxides exhibited quite different behaviors and mechanisms in algae treatment with a small dosage of 0 2 mm pms and h2o2 were able to inhibit the algae growth with negligible change in ph and limited doc release however a very weak efficiency for the removal was found when pds was used due to the asymmetric structure pms had the ability to directly degrade mc lr and pigments proteins while other peroxides could not the killing of algae is achieved via different mechanisms for h2o2 it was done via entering algae cell while for pms it was done via changes in the proteins in cell membranes a direct oxidation pathway of algae inactivation by h2o2 instead of oh was proposed for the treatment by pms the direct non radical oxidation pathway 80 and the radical pathway 20 were responsible for algae cell damage when applied in the treatment of algae contaminated water in a reservoir pms well performed longer lasting algae inhibition duration 60 d than h2o2 12 d though pms has been used in removal of several organic compounds with success its direct application in algae has yet to be proposed and documented our research work reported here demonstrates that pms is the most promising peroxide for algae removal with a high efficiency and negligible release of toxins besides removing algae cells pms had the ability to degrade the toxic algal exudates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16847,humic like acids has are abundant in sewage sludge but mainly bonded with solids thus their influences are often neglected in conventional digestion processes currently thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp has been widely adopted in sludge anaerobic digestion ad to enhance hydrolysis of complex matters and further to improve methane production however the impacts of enhanced release of has and the mechanisms involved are not well understood and need to be further investigated because the substantial amounts of has present in ad could severely threaten the sludge ad processes results in the present study indicated that the concentration of soluble has in sludge was elevated by 90 times due to the thp from 8 mg l in raw sludge to 727 mg l in the pretreated sludge hydrolyzed at 180 c moreover the structural characteristics of soluble has including aromatic condensation degree elemental composition and functional group also showed substantial differences with the increased temperature of the thp furthermore the release of has presented significant influences on sludge digestion acidification rate was inhibited by over 50 with 0 4 g l of has whereas methanogenesis was improved by nearly 200 with 0 8 g l has and inhibited about 50 with 2 0 g l the activities of proteinase and co enzyme f420 were decreased by 20 and increased by 19 respectively under has stress at 0 6 g l for 5 days moreover molecular structural changes of soluble has also contributed to the influences especially the e4 e6 value representing the degree of has aromatic condensation and c n ratio of soluble has were closely correlated with their inhibition degree to sludge hydrolysis the findings of this study demonstrate that the influences of has are evident and also vary to the different steps of anaerobic digestion processes which shall not be negligible during the sludge digestion that is with thp due to the rate limiting step was methanogenesis in the ad process of pretreated sludge by thermal hydrolysis has concentration was recommended at low level for example around 1 0 g l to accelerate or not limit methanogenesis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion humic like acids thermal hydrolysis inhibition structural characteristics 1 introduction approximately 12 million tons dry municipal sludge each year are produced in china and sludge disposal takes almost 40 60 of the total operational cost in wastewater treatment plants wwtps liu et al 2017 methane production from the sludge is a promising technology which can not only effectively reduce the environmental hazards of waste activated sludge was but also generate clean energy liu et al 2018 mao et al 2015 vasco et al 2018 however relatively low conversion rates of organics limit the rates of methane production and reduction of sludge in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod or volatile solid vs related to volume reduction dewaterability and stability which subsequently restricts the overall economic benefits curves et al 2009 liu et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 nowadays thermal hydrolysis has been widely employed to enhance the performance of ad during sludge hydrolysis cell walls of microbes break down particulate organic matter and cellular materials can be disintegrated and soluble microbial by products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss are hydrolyzed into small molecular organics gonzalez et al 2018 choi et al 2018 hii et al 2019 however some inhibitory substances such as has are also released into the supernatant resulting in an increase of residual organic matter previous results showed that although the total content of has in sludge remained constant during thermal treatment over 35 of humic and fulvic acids were solubilized into the liquid from the solids the concentration of soluble humic substances could be increased from 0 1 to 1 0 g l to 1 0 8 0 g l and even up to 8 0 15 0 g l in high solid sludge ad ghasimi et al 2016 liu et al 2019 tang et al 2018 with the wide applications of thermal hydrolysis in sludge pretreatment the impacts of has on sludge ad has attracted more and more attentions there are already several reports about the influences of commercial has on sludge ad azman et al 2017 liu et al 2015 li et al 2019b however these findings are quite different and sometimes even contradict with each other on the one hand some of the studies reported the existence of has was harmful to ad process for example xu et al 2020 reported that commercial has enhanced the structural stability of organics in sludge and restricted their solubility ahmad et al 2017 indicated high concentration has inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogens by more than 75 and azman et al 2017 showed that has with increased concentrations reduced hydrolysis efficiency by 40 on the other hand some works stated the presence of has was beneficial to ad process for example li et al 2019a and liu et al 2015 reported that the presence of has improved sludge hydrolysis and ghasimi et al 2016 showed that has had no effect on cumulative methane production based on the recent published results the mechanisms of has involved in the influences on sludge digestion can be roughly defined as four categories namely binding with enzymes and substrates electron shuttling regulation to microbial communities and complexation with metal ions li et al 2019a xu et al 2020 thus in this present study we hypothesized that the effects of has on sludge ad are not only related to the contents of soluble has but also to their structural characteristics which shall explain these conflicting findings reported therefore the aim of this current study was to explore the actual evolutions of has during sludge thermal hydrolysis as well as their influences on sludge digestion the changes of soluble has in concentrations and structural characteristics were investigated by gradually elevating hydrolysis intensity under has stresses with different concentrations and structural characteristics the performances of sludge anaerobic fermentation for volatile fatty acids vfas production were investigated to determine has inhibitions to hydrolysis phase and acetate digestion for methane production were implemented to shed an insight on has influences to methanogenesis phase coupling effects of concentration and structural characteristics of has on their inhibition to hydrolysis were studied besides correlation analyses between structural characteristics of has and their inhibitory effects on vfas production were carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge was used as the substrate for ad was taken from the sludge storage tank of a local wwtp in wuxi city china the fresh was was pre concentrated before used liu et al 2017 the concentrated was had ph of 6 5 7 5 total solids ts of 140 160 g l vs of 70 90 g l and scod of 130 0 140 0 mg l all measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 2 sludge thermal hydrolysis sludge thermal hydrolysis was performed in a thermal hydrolysis reactor with effective volume of 0 6 l this reactor consisted of a control unit electrical heating cooling system thermometers pressure gage and reducing valves the data acquisition and control system were used to measure pressure and temperature the prepared sludge samples of was mentioned above were diluted with deionized water to ts of 10 were firstly heated to the desired temperature namely 40 60 100 140 160 180 200 and 220 c respectively then sludge hydrolysis proceeded under the constant temperature for 30 min before the cooling system was switched on when the temperature dropped to 40 c the pressure reducing valve was open finally all of the hydrolyzed sludge was taken out and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solid and the liquid 2 3 anaerobic fermentation for vfas production the experiments were conducted in 500 ml serum bottles each bottle was fed with substrate glucose or sludge hydrolyzate and seeding sludge to 250 ml at a volume ratio of 9 1 has used in the study were extracted from thermal hydrolysate dosages of has were 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 g l respectively then phs of all of the bottles were adjusted to 10 0 0 2 by diluted hcl and naoh solutions oxygen in the headspace and the liquid was purged by n2 gas for 15 min to maintain strict anaerobic condition during the entire batch test bottles were placed in a shaking incubator with a rotation speed of 130 rpm temperature of 35 c and ph of 10 0 samples taken from bottles at certain intervals were analyzed all the bottles were adjusted to ph of 10 0 and purged by n2 gas for 15 min to maintain strict anaerobic condition after taking out the samples regularly every day all the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates 2 4 ad for methane production the experiments were conducted in 500 ml serum bottles each bottle was fed with was and seeding sludge to 250 ml under a vs ratio of 5 2 the vs concentration of was and seeding sludge were 20 88 0 78 g l and 50 70 2 73 g l respectively has used in the study were extracted from thermal hydrolysate dosages of has were 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 g l respectively then all of the bottles were adjusted to ph of 7 0 0 2 by dilute hcl and naoh solutions oxygen was removed by n2 aeration for about 15 min bottles were placed in a shaking incubator with rotation speed of 130 rpm and temperature of 35 c each bottle was connected to an external gas collection bag which was replaced daily all the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates in order to explore the effect of has on methanogenesis sodium acetate of 10 g l was used as substrate for ad for methane production the dosage levels of has were 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 g l the used bottles were the same as that mentioned above in vfas production ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 oxygen was removed by n2 gas for about 15 min bottles were placed in a shaking incubator with a rotation speed of 130 rpm and temperature of 35 c each bottle was connected to an external gas collection bag which was replaced daily all the tests were carried out independently in triplicates 2 5 extraction of has the freeze dried and sieved samples were used to extract ha according to the method implemented by the international humic substances society ihss thurman et al 1981 hcl of 6 mol l was used to acidify the samples including sludge and hydrolyzate to ph of 1 0 to get the precipitate naoh of 6 mol l was used to dissolve the precipitates to get the supernatant operations mentioned above were repeated to get the purified precipitates the precipitates were further acidified by the mixed solution of 0 1 mol l hcl and 0 3 mol l hf the volume ratio of 1 1 and then shaken for 12 h finally the supernatants were discarded and the precipitates has extracts were washed for several times with ultrapure water to completely remove chloride ion all the has samples were freeze dried into the powder the has obtained from was without thp and hydrolyzate of pre treated sludge at 40 60 100 140 160 180 200 and 220 c were tagged as wnhas 40 c has 60 c has 100 c has 140 c has 160 c has 180 c has 200 c has and 220 c has respectively the above mentioned ihss method was used to extract the has samples in solid phase and liquid phase respectively soluble has represented humic like acids in the liquid phase the gravimetric method was used to quantify the contents of has in the samples lee et al 1992 the loss part is equal to the amount of total has minus the sum amount of has in the liquid phase and has in the solid phase total amount of has refers to the has content in raw sludge that has not been thermally hydrolyzed each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the standard deviations of all analyses were less than 5 2 6 e4 e6 ratio e4 e6 ratio is an important index indicating the structural characteristics of has and inversely proportional to the aromatic condensation has with low e4 e6 ratio are difficult to be decomposed during ad chen et al 1977 tanja et al 2017 to obtain the e4 e6 ratio the absorbance at 465 nm and 665 nm of solutions of 30 mg extracted has in 100 ml 0 05 mol l nahco3 were recorded using a uv vis spectrophotometer the ratio of absorbance at 465 nm to that at

indexes including cod ts vs were analyzed according to the standard methods issued by the state environmental protection administration of china 2002 vfas concentrations in the filtrate were measured by a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu japan equipped with an auto injector aoc 20i shimadzu japan samples filtered via the membrane of 0 22 μm were acidified by 3 m phosphoric acid and stored at 20 c until further use the total vfas concentration was calculated by summing up each individual vfa liu et al 2017 the acidification rate was obtained by dividing vfa concentration by substrate concentration both of which were indicated by cod the equivalents of acetate propionate butyrate isobutyrate valerate isovalerate caproate heptanoate and caprylate were equal to 1 07 1 57 1 82 2 04 2

1984 in the methanogenic phase respectively each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the standard deviations of all analyses were less than 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced release of has by thermal hydrolysis 3 1 1 improved concentration of soluble has in hydrolyzed sludge high temperature thermal hydrolysis strengthened has release from the sludge into the liquid increasing soluble has concentration in thermal hydrolysate according to fig 1 a1 a4 fri was performed to obtain the composition of the organic matter in the supernatant of thermal hydrolysis of the sludge as shown in fig 1b refractory components mainly humic and fluvic acids dominated the organics in hydrolysate li et al 2016 also reported that alkaline pretreatment resulted in an increase of residual dissolved organic matter which was mainly composed of humic substances 52 9 and high molecular weight protein like substances 49 9 moreover as shown in fig 1c has release was significantly strengthened as hydrolysis temperature was increased from 100 to180 c the concentration of soluble has reached the maximum of approximately 727 mg l at 180 c and tended to decrease under a further enhancement of hydrolysis temperature the content of soluble fulvic acids also changed with the increase of the hydrolysis temperature fulvic acids was converted to has via the abiotic processes during the pretreatment yang et al 2016 therefore results indicated that it was important to adjust the temperature during sludge thermal hydrolysis to control the formation of refractory components 3 1 2 distribution of has in hydrolyzed sludge although large amounts of has in sludge were released into the supernatant by thermal hydrolysis most of the has still existed in the solid phase and kept at inert states as shown in fig 2 almost all of the has in raw sludge were in the solid phase with the increase of hydrolysis temperature has in sludge tended to transform from the solid phase to the liquid phase but their concentrations in liquid phase would no longer increase and even slightly decrease as the hydrolysis temperature reached a certain level such as over 180 c moreover during the thermal hydrolysis there appeared to be a loss in the total amount of has in sludge which should be attributed to the larger amount of decomposed has than generated at excessively high temperatures wang et al 2020 also reported has were transformed to other organics such as fulvic acids char or tar yang et al 2016 also observed a mutual conversion between humic and fulvic acids during the thermal hydrolysis process however with the further increase of hydrolysis temperature the content of has in solid seemed to keep stable relatively thus it indicated that the chemical structure of has in the solid phase was rather stable and decomposition of has mainly happened in the liquid phase furthermore it is worth to be noted that besides the changes in concentrations has structure also kept evolving with the increase of hydrolysis temperature possibly making has more inhibitory to sludge digestion in particular with hydrolysis process during the ad liu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 therefore the results evidently indicated that thermal hydrolysis indeed induced the increase in concentrations and changes in structure of soluble has in sludge which presumably leads to potential inhibitory impacts to sludge ad liu et al 2015 li et al 2019a 3 1 3 response of has release to hydrolysis temperature the amount of released has in the supernatant overall increased with the enhancement of hydrolysis temperature but the production or release rate of the has changed greatly in different ranges of hydrolysis temperature in order to elucidate the mathematical relationship between the hydrolysis temperature and the release of has the range of low and medium temperatures was classified in the same group as shown in fig 3 during thermal hydrolysis the changes of dissolved has concentration presented evidently linear correlation with increase of the hydrolysis temperature p 0 05 when the temperature was below 140 c the concentrations of soluble has gradually increased with the enhancement of hydrolysis temperature and their coefficient k was 1 2067 when the temperature increased from 140 to 180 c has concentration sharply increased and the rate coefficient k was rapidly raised to 14 06 however further enhancing hydrolysis temperature the release rate of has started to slow down possibly corresponding with has conversions into other substances through decomposition and condensation current thermal pretreatments for sludge digestion could be roughly divided into moderate and high temperature hydrolysis the latter has already been widely used in full scale projects under temperatures of 140 180 c thus the results further confirmed the significance of focusing on the potential impacts of has release and conversion on sludge hydrolysis especially in the range of 140 180 c 3 2 altered chemical structure of has during thermal hydrolysis 3 2 1 changes in aromatic condensation aromatic condensation of has could be used to positively characterize their contents of hydrophobic portions with high molecular weight such as aromatic acids and phenol liu et al 2015 reported has with high hydrophobicity could improve solubilization of sludge particulate organic matter just like the function of surfactant by accelerating the dissolutions of organic compounds in sludge and maintaining the activity of hydrolase moreover it also reported that aromatic condensation of has was positively related to their redox potential of the quinone groups li et al 2019a aromatic condensation of has is inversely proportional to the ratio of e4 e6 chen et al 1977 has with low e4 e6 ratio are difficult to be decomposed during ad li et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 thermal hydrolysis at medium or low temperature such as 100 c resulted in the decrease of aromatic condensation degree of has in sludge while high temperature such as 160 200 c caused the enhancement of has aromatic condensation comparing with wnhas the control a slight increase of e4 e6 ratio happened in the has extracted from the hydrolyzed sludge under 100 c 100 c has which was likely ascribed to the breakage of the aromatic rings during hydrolytic process rodriguez et al 2016 however with further increase of temperature e4 e6 ratio of has in the hydrolyzed sludge tended to decrease substantially and the aromatic condensation of sludge has reached the maximum at the temperature of 200 c therefore the results indicated thermal hydrolysis induce the changes of has structure and make the has more aggressive to sludge digestion however most of recent publications merely focus on the influences of has concentration during sludge digestion which is likely to underestimate the effect of has 3 2 2 changes in elemental composition elemental composition is also an important indicator of has biochemical activity which can be used to analyze the change law of has structure during sludge thermal hydrolysis and predict their influences on ad for example hernandez et al 1988 reported that nitrogen content in has was positively relative to the contents of amino acids and microorganism tissue which had good bioavailability as shown in table 1 the content of nitrogen in has was sharply reduced by the increased temperature therefore the results indicated that with the enhancement of thermal hydrolysis temperature has not only underwent changes and or migrations of functional group and an increase in aromaticity but also in essence the overall bioavailability of has decreased moreover the result could be further confirmed by the decreased h c ratio in has with the increase of sludge hydrolysis temperature as shown in table 1 garcía et al 1992 and fernandes et al 2015 reported that the ratio of h c 1 represented the high aromatic condensation furthermore the changes in elemental composition reflected the variations of functional group structure the c n ratio was negatively relative to the content of aliphatic n and positively relative to that of heterocyclic structures hernandez et al 1988 li et al 2014 as shown in table 1 the ratio of c n rapidly increased with the enhancement of hydrolysis temperature mainly due to the formation of n substituted glycosylamine by the condensation reactions between amino acids and sugars therefore the analysis of elemental composition indicated that as the temperature increased the has structure tended to be stable and the biodegradability would decrease 3 2 3 changes in functional groups the functional groups of has in pretreated sludge were also changed during thermal hydrolysis the characteristics of infrared spectra of the soluble has were shown in fig 5 comparing with the control and pretreated sludge under 100 c soluble has extracted from the hydrolysate of the pretreated sludge under 160 c 160 c has tended to have fewer functional groups which were mainly composed of three bond functional groups cc and concentrated at near wavenumber amir et al 2010 as temperature increased the types of functional groups increased and the groups were gradually dominated by single bond functional groups the spectra of the soluble has extracted from pretreated sludge under 180 c 180 c has showed a high band intensity at 1650 amide i 1230 and 1260 cm 1 cn stretching carboxyl group oh bending the results indicated high contents of amides ethers and esters that is the oxidation of this has was relatively low tristan et al 2018 as the hydrolysis temperature continuously increased up to 200 and 220 c the amount and intensity of the peaks in spectra obviously increased possibly because of decomposition reactions therefore the results indicated that as the hydrolysis temperature increased the abundance of functional group types in the has extracted from the pretreated sludge decreased firstly and then increased simultaneously accompanying with the changes in the total amount and structure of functional groups 3 3 influences of has release on sludge ad 3 3 1 inhibition of has with enhanced concentration to sludge fermentation for vfas production sludge fermentation for vfas production were severely inhibited by the enhancement of soluble has concentrations as shown in fig 6 a when the has concentration was just elevated by 0 2 g l the total vfas concentration decreased to the half of that of the control from 9800 to 4800 mg l moreover the total vfas concentration presented a sharp decrease over the further increase of has concentrations the results obtained in this study differ from that observed reports for example liu et al 2015 reported vfas production from sludge hydrolysis was accelerated due to the increase of has concentration however it was interestingly found that the humic substances reported to be inhibitory were mainly from the extracts of soil sludge landfill leachate and maize etc whereas those beneficial to ad were mainly fossil or commercial liang et al 2021 the influences of has on sludge hydrolysis are not only related to their concentrations but also related to their structure as mentioned above the mechanisms of influences of has on sludge digestion mainly include bundling electron shuttling microbial regulation and metal complexation li et al 2019a as shown in fig 6b the increase of has concentration presented no obvious impact on the composition of vfas production from anaerobic fermentation of sludge the dosage of has increased from 0 to 1 0 g l acetate kept being the predominant vfas component in each group and accounted for 53 85 followed by propionate which accounted for 5 10 isobutyrate butyrate isovalerate valerate caproate heptanoate were almost around 4 followed by a few caprylate thus the results indicated the increase of has concentration presumably had little influence on the composition of the microbial community and its metabolic pathways li et al 2021 azman et al 2017 meanwhile given that the content of heavy metal in the sludge used in this study was very low the role of has in complexation with metal ions was limited furthermore via electron transfer the hydrolysis of organics in sludge could often be enhanced liu et al 2013 liu et al 2015 therefore the main inhibition mechanism of has on sludge hydrolysis should be the bundling of has with functional enzymes and substrates 3 3 2 inhibition of has with altered structure to fermentation for vfas production the inhibition of has to sludge hydrolysis was related to not only their concentrations but also their structural characteristics as shown in fig 7 their effects on acidification rate from glucose fermentation varied greatly between has with the same concentrations but obtained from different sludge hydrolysates except for the has extracted from 160 c hydrolyzed sludge all of other has presented inhibitory effects on glucose fermentation and their inhibition became more acute with the increase of has concentrations though the half inhibitory concentrations of each has were different most of the has were around 0 4 g l however significant differences existed in inhibition degree between different has to glucose fermentation as shown in fig 7 under the same concentrations has extracted from the raw sludge wnhas and medium temperature pretreated sludge 100 c has seemed more inhibitory than other has extracted from high temperature pretreated sludge samples namely 160 c has 180 c has 200 c has and 220 c has especially at low concentration of 0 2 g l the addition of 160 c has improved vfas production from glucose fermentation the observed phenomenon possibly was attributed to the enhanced stability of has structure during the increase of hydrolysis temperature moreover correlation analysis was implemented to quantify the influences of has structural characteristics on their inhibition to hydrolysis of organics considering the several main structural characteristics aforementioned as shown in table 2 the influence of has structural characteristics could be neglected at low concentration of 0 2 g l but become more and more significant with the increase of has concentration e4 e6 and c n ratios presented significant correlation p 0 05 with the inhibition of hydrolysis of organics when has concentration was 0 4 g l however as has concentration increased some structural features such as c h of has always showed no significant correlation with has inhibition to the hydrolysis of organics thus the results indicated that release of has by thermal hydrolysis inhibited biodegradation of the organics during sludge digestion the performance of the ad process was evidently related to has concentration and structural characteristics and within a certain concentration range quantitative relationships between has structural characteristics and the inhibition to the biodegradation of organic matter are demonstrated 3 3 3 influences of released has on methanogenic ad sludge ad for methane production was promoted by has at low concentration and inhibited at high concentration as shown in fig 8 methane production was firstly promoted when has concentration in the reactors was less than 1 0 g l however the enhancement in ch4 production seemingly reached the peak at the concentration of has of about 0 8 g l and then tended to decline moreover when has concentration further increased to 2 0 4 0 g l sludge ad was heavily inhibited and the cumulative methane production was only about half of that of the control group as shown in fig 8 the daily ch4 production in each test sharply increased until they reached the maximum but the tests at low has concentration 0 0 6 g l reached their peaks four days earlier day 4 than other tests with has concentration of 0 8 1 0 g l with the further increase of ha dosage up to 2 0 4 0 g l the daily methane production reached the maximum on day 11 and has caused a lag phase in daily methane peaks therefore the results indicated that the mechanisms of the influences of has on sludge ad were likely multiple and could be roughly divided into two distinct types one boosting methane production and the other inhibiting methane methanogenesis for example azman et al 2017 reported has could inhibit sludge ad by binding hydrolase but li et al 2019a found has could promote sludge ad by facilitating electron transfer under low concentrations the contribution of has to sludge ad was greater than inhibition whereas under high concentrations vice versa methane production from sludge ad included hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis the presence of has at low concentrations evidently promoted acetoclastic methanogenesis as shown in fig 9 almost at all levels of has concentrations the processes of methane production from acetate digestion were clearly boosted and methane production was enhanced significantly as the content of has increased however some divergences among different has were also observed the has from raw sludge and sludge pretreated at a medium temperature showed stronger promotion effects to methanogenesis than that of has from sludge pretreated at a high temperature for example has extracted from hydrolyzed sludge under 160 c 160 c has improved biogas production by nearly 200 while 200 c has did not evidently strengthen methane production liu et al 2015 found the introduction of commercial has during sludge digestion affected methane production namely no noticeable influence on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis but a clear inhibition to aceticlastic methanogenesis the inhibitory effect was closely related to the characteristics of the commercial has the mechanisms of influences of has on methanogenesis were mainly contributed to their competition with some key enzymes for electrons therefore the different results observed in this study possibly are linked to that fact that the structural characteristics of has extracted from sludge determined their ability to gain and give electrons which was presumably different from the characteristics of the commercial has 3 3 4 influence of released has on enzymatic activity the increase of has concertation inhibited the activity of hydrolytic protease but promoted the activity of the key enzymes for methanogenesis as depicted in fig 10 after about 5 days operation at has concentration of 0 6 g l the activity of proteinase was decreased by 20 while the activity of co enzyme f420 was increased to 119 in the reactors for anaerobic digestion of the sludge has are defined as a cluster of organic compounds with different molecular sizes has with large molecules might be rejected by cell structure and accumulated outside the cell of the fermenting bacteria inhibiting the activity of extracellular hydrolase through binding x w li et al 2013 fernandes et al 2015 while has with small molecules could pass through the cell membrane and facilitate in electron transfer to increase the activity of methanogenesis enzymes the statement could also explain the observed phenomenon of influences of has on sludge ad at high has concentrations extracellular hydrolase possibly became inactivated by combining with has that abundantly existed outside of microorganism cells while inside of the cells due to the saturation of has their contributions in electron transfer were presumably no longer increased with their concentrations however at relatively low concentrations the inhibitory effect of has to extracellular enzymes was limited which could be readily offset by their contributions on promotion of methanogenesis via electron transfer 3 4 mechanisms analysis the effect of has on sludge ad is the result of a combination of multiple mechanisms include bundling electron shuttling and microbial regulation based on the results obtained in this paper it can be seen that has under low concentration could bind the dissolved organic matter and extracellular enzymes reducing the sludge acidification efficiency however the cell walls of bacteria would prevent the macromolecular has passing through the cells thus the inhibition on intracellular methanogenesis enzymes can be ignored although has with small molecule could pass through the cell membrane the effect of binding enzymes was not significant since the binding of has to enzymes acted like that of cellulose furthermore has with small molecule participated in electron transferring enhancing the activity of methanogenesis enzymes therefore has under low concentration would inhibit vfas production but improve methane production however has under high concentration could inhibit both acidification and methanogenesis the former inhibition was caused by the bundle of has to substrates and enzymes and the latter inhibition was probably related to the bunch of has to methanogens and dissolved organic matter during ad 4 conclusions has release and their influences on sludge ad with thp seemingly are underestimated which are likely to be the causes to low methane yield results of this study presented an insight into the evolutions of has in sludge during thp and proposed a new concept of synergistically interfering the ad via has concentration and structural characteristics the following remarks are concluded 1 has release from sludge can be accelerated with the increase of hydrolysis temperature the concentration of soluble has substantially increased from 8 mg l in raw sludge to 727 mg l in the pretreated sludge hydrolyzed at 180 c 2 chemical structure of has was severely altered during sludge thp has extracted from sludge hydrolyzed at 200 c presented the largest aromatic condensation degree functional groups of 160 chas were mainly composed of unsaturated bonds but as hydrolysis temperature raised bonds in the functional groups began to break and single bond substances formed 3 acidification rate was inhibited by over 50 with 0 4 g l of has besides the concentration increases changes of has structural characteristics also play an important role on their influences on sludge digestion in particular the e4 e6 and c n ratios of has had a significant correlation with the inhibition to vfas production during sludge anaerobic fermentation 4 sludge ad for methane production was promoted by has at low concentration below 1 0 g l and inhibited at high concentration over 2 0 g l and the extent of the effect was also closely relative to the structural characteristics of has the increase of has concentration in sludge ad inhibited the activity of hydrolytic protease but promoted the activity of the key enzymes for methanogenesis the activities of proteinase and co enzyme f420 were decreased by 20 and increased by 19 respectively with has at 0 6 g l for 5 days 5 due to the rate limiting step was methanogenesis in the ad process of pretreated sludge by thermal hydrolysis has concentration was recommended at low level for example around 1 0 g l to accelerate or not limit methanogenesis

16847,humic like acids has are abundant in sewage sludge but mainly bonded with solids thus their influences are often neglected in conventional digestion processes currently thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp has been widely adopted in sludge anaerobic digestion ad to enhance hydrolysis of complex matters and further to improve methane production however the impacts of enhanced release of has and the mechanisms involved are not well understood and need to be further investigated because the substantial amounts of has present in ad could severely threaten the sludge ad processes results in the present study indicated that the concentration of soluble has in sludge was elevated by 90 times due to the thp from 8 mg l in raw sludge to 727 mg l in the pretreated sludge hydrolyzed at 180 c moreover the structural characteristics of soluble has including aromatic condensation degree elemental composition and functional group also showed substantial differences with the increased temperature of the thp furthermore the release of has presented significant influences on sludge digestion acidification rate was inhibited by over 50 with 0 4 g l of has whereas methanogenesis was improved by nearly 200 with 0 8 g l has and inhibited about 50 with 2 0 g l the activities of proteinase and co enzyme f420 were decreased by 20 and increased by 19 respectively under has stress at 0 6 g l for 5 days moreover molecular structural changes of soluble has also contributed to the influences especially the e4 e6 value representing the degree of has aromatic condensation and c n ratio of soluble has were closely correlated with their inhibition degree to sludge hydrolysis the findings of this study demonstrate that the influences of has are evident and also vary to the different steps of anaerobic digestion processes which shall not be negligible during the sludge digestion that is with thp due to the rate limiting step was methanogenesis in the ad process of pretreated sludge by thermal hydrolysis has concentration was recommended at low level for example around 1 0 g l to accelerate or not limit methanogenesis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion humic like acids thermal hydrolysis inhibition structural characteristics 1 introduction approximately 12 million tons dry municipal sludge each year are produced in china and sludge disposal takes almost 40 60 of the total operational cost in wastewater treatment plants wwtps liu et al 2017 methane production from the sludge is a promising technology which can not only effectively reduce the environmental hazards of waste activated sludge was but also generate clean energy liu et al 2018 mao et al 2015 vasco et al 2018 however relatively low conversion rates of organics limit the rates of methane production and reduction of sludge in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod or volatile solid vs related to volume reduction dewaterability and stability which subsequently restricts the overall economic benefits curves et al 2009 liu et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 nowadays thermal hydrolysis has been widely employed to enhance the performance of ad during sludge hydrolysis cell walls of microbes break down particulate organic matter and cellular materials can be disintegrated and soluble microbial by products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss are hydrolyzed into small molecular organics gonzalez et al 2018 choi et al 2018 hii et al 2019 however some inhibitory substances such as has are also released into the supernatant resulting in an increase of residual organic matter previous results showed that although the total content of has in sludge remained constant during thermal treatment over 35 of humic and fulvic acids were solubilized into the liquid from the solids the concentration of soluble humic substances could be increased from 0 1 to 1 0 g l to 1 0 8 0 g l and even up to 8 0 15 0 g l in high solid sludge ad ghasimi et al 2016 liu et al 2019 tang et al 2018 with the wide applications of thermal hydrolysis in sludge pretreatment the impacts of has on sludge ad has attracted more and more attentions there are already several reports about the influences of commercial has on sludge ad azman et al 2017 liu et al 2015 li et al 2019b however these findings are quite different and sometimes even contradict with each other on the one hand some of the studies reported the existence of has was harmful to ad process for example xu et al 2020 reported that commercial has enhanced the structural stability of organics in sludge and restricted their solubility ahmad et al 2017 indicated high concentration has inhibited hydrogenotrophic methanogens by more than 75 and azman et al 2017 showed that has with increased concentrations reduced hydrolysis efficiency by 40 on the other hand some works stated the presence of has was beneficial to ad process for example li et al 2019a and liu et al 2015 reported that the presence of has improved sludge hydrolysis and ghasimi et al 2016 showed that has had no effect on cumulative methane production based on the recent published results the mechanisms of has involved in the influences on sludge digestion can be roughly defined as four categories namely binding with enzymes and substrates electron shuttling regulation to microbial communities and complexation with metal ions li et al 2019a xu et al 2020 thus in this present study we hypothesized that the effects of has on sludge ad are not only related to the contents of soluble has but also to their structural characteristics which shall explain these conflicting findings reported therefore the aim of this current study was to explore the actual evolutions of has during sludge thermal hydrolysis as well as their influences on sludge digestion the changes of soluble has in concentrations and structural characteristics were investigated by gradually elevating hydrolysis intensity under has stresses with different concentrations and structural characteristics the performances of sludge anaerobic fermentation for volatile fatty acids vfas production were investigated to determine has inhibitions to hydrolysis phase and acetate digestion for methane production were implemented to shed an insight on has influences to methanogenesis phase coupling effects of concentration and structural characteristics of has on their inhibition to hydrolysis were studied besides correlation analyses between structural characteristics of has and their inhibitory effects on vfas production were carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge was used as the substrate for ad was taken from the sludge storage tank of a local wwtp in wuxi city china the fresh was was pre concentrated before used liu et al 2017 the concentrated was had ph of 6 5 7 5 total solids ts of 140 160 g l vs of 70 90 g l and scod of 130 0 140 0 mg l all measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 2 sludge thermal hydrolysis sludge thermal hydrolysis was performed in a thermal hydrolysis reactor with effective volume of 0 6 l this reactor consisted of a control unit electrical heating cooling system thermometers pressure gage and reducing valves the data acquisition and control system were used to measure pressure and temperature the prepared sludge samples of was mentioned above were diluted with deionized water to ts of 10 were firstly heated to the desired temperature namely 40 60 100 140 160 180 200 and 220 c respectively then sludge hydrolysis proceeded under the constant temperature for 30 min before the cooling system was switched on when the temperature dropped to 40 c the pressure reducing valve was open finally all of the hydrolyzed sludge was taken out and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solid and the liquid 2 3 anaerobic fermentation for vfas production the experiments were conducted in 500 ml serum bottles

min to maintain strict anaerobic condition during the entire batch test bottles were placed in a shaking incubator with a rotation speed of 130 rpm temperature of 35 c and ph of 10 0 samples taken from bottles at certain intervals were analyzed all the bottles were adjusted to ph of 10 0 and purged by n2 gas for 15 min to maintain strict anaerobic condition after taking out the samples regularly every day all the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates 2 4 ad for methane production the experiments were conducted in 500 ml serum bottles each bottle was fed with was and seeding sludge to 250 ml under a vs ratio of 5 2 the vs concentration of was and seeding sludge were 20 88 0 78 g l and 50 70 2 73 g l respectively has used in the study were extracted from thermal hydrolysate dosages of has were 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 g l respectively then all of the bottles were adjusted to ph of 7 0 0 2 by dilute hcl and naoh solutions oxygen was removed by n2 aeration for about 15 min bottles were placed in a shaking incubator with rotation speed of 130 rpm and temperature of 35 c each bottle was connected to an external gas collection bag which was replaced daily all the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates in order to explore the effect of has on methanogenesis sodium acetate of 10 g l was used as substrate for ad for methane production the dosage levels of has were 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 g l the used bottles were the same as that mentioned above in vfas production ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 oxygen was removed by n2 gas for about 15 min bottles were placed in a shaking incubator with a rotation speed of 130 rpm and temperature of 35 c each bottle was connected to an external gas collection bag which was replaced daily all the tests were carried out independently in triplicates 2 5 extraction of has the freeze dried and sieved samples were used to extract ha according to the method implemented by the international humic substances society ihss thurman et al 1981 hcl of 6 mol l was used to acidify the samples including sludge and hydrolyzate to ph of 1 0 to get the precipitate naoh of 6 mol l was used to dissolve the precipitates to get the supernatant operations mentioned above were repeated to get the purified precipitates the precipitates were further acidified by the mixed solution of 0 1 mol l hcl and 0 3 mol l hf the volume ratio of 1 1 and then shaken for 12 h finally the supernatants were discarded and the precipitates has extracts were washed for several times with ultrapure water to completely remove chloride ion all the has samples were freeze dried into the powder the has obtained from was without thp and hydrolyzate of pre treated sludge at 40 60 100 140 160 180 200 and 220

and liquid phase respectively soluble has represented humic like acids in the liquid phase the gravimetric method was used to quantify the contents of has in the samples lee et al 1992 the loss part is equal to the amount of total has minus the sum amount of has in the liquid phase and has in the solid phase total amount of has refers to the has content in raw sludge that has not been thermally hydrolyzed each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the standard deviations of all analyses were less than 5 2 6 e4 e6 ratio e4 e6 ratio is an important index indicating the structural characteristics of has and inversely proportional to the aromatic condensation has with low e4 e6 ratio are difficult to be decomposed during ad chen et al 1977 tanja et al 2017 to obtain the e4 e6 ratio the absorbance at 465 nm and 665 nm of solutions of 30 mg extracted has in 100 ml 0 05 mol l nahco3 were recorded using a uv vis spectrophotometer the ratio of absorbance at 465 nm to that at 665 nm was defined as the e4 e6 ratio x w li et al 2013 each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the standard deviations of all analyses were less than 5 2 7 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra all the supernatants of hydrolyzed sludge and extracted has samples were filtered by a filter membrane of 0 22 μm and then uniformly adjusted to the same concentration of about

fluorescence region formed by the excitation and emission wavelengths in general peaks at shorter excitation wavelengths of 250 nm and shorter emission wavelengths of 380 nm are related to simple aromatic proteins such as tyrosine region i and ii peaks at excitation wavelengths of 250 nm and emission wavelengths of 350 nm are related to the fulvic acid like organics region iii peaks at intermediate excitation wavelengths of 250 280 nm and emission wavelength of 380 nm are related to soluble microbial byproduct like material region iv peaks at excitation wavelengths of 280 nm and

which they were filtered with 0 45 μm filters the cod value was measured by the potassium dichromate method ts and vs values of sludge were calculated according to the gravimetric method conventional indexes including cod ts vs were analyzed according to the standard methods issued by the state environmental protection administration of china 2002 vfas concentrations in the filtrate were measured by a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu japan equipped with an auto injector aoc 20i shimadzu japan samples filtered via the membrane of 0 22 μm were acidified by 3 m phosphoric acid and stored at 20 c until further use the total vfas concentration was calculated by summing up each individual vfa liu et al 2017 the acidification rate was obtained by dividing vfa concentration by substrate concentration both of which were indicated by cod the equivalents of acetate propionate butyrate isobutyrate valerate isovalerate caproate heptanoate and caprylate were equal to 1 07 1 57 1 82 2 04 2 21 2 34 and 2 44 mg cod g respectively hydrolytic protease was employed using the methods by liu et al 2015 in hydrolytic phase and f420 reducing hydrogenase was based on the method used by trevors 1984 in the methanogenic phase respectively each sample was analyzed in triplicate and the standard deviations of all analyses were less than 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced release of has by thermal hydrolysis 3 1 1 improved concentration of soluble has in hydrolyzed sludge high temperature thermal hydrolysis strengthened has release from the sludge into the liquid increasing soluble has concentration in thermal hydrolysate according to fig 1 a1 a4 fri was performed to obtain the composition of the organic matter in the supernatant of thermal hydrolysis of the sludge as shown in fig 1b refractory components mainly humic and fluvic acids dominated the organics in hydrolysate li et al 2016 also reported that alkaline pretreatment resulted in an increase of residual dissolved organic matter which was mainly composed of humic substances 52 9 and high molecular weight protein like substances 49 9 moreover as shown in fig 1c has release was significantly strengthened as hydrolysis temperature was increased from 100 to180 c the concentration of soluble has reached the maximum of approximately 727 mg l at 180 c and tended to decrease under a further enhancement of hydrolysis temperature the content of soluble fulvic acids also changed with the increase of the hydrolysis temperature fulvic acids was converted to has via the abiotic processes during the pretreatment yang et al 2016 therefore results indicated that it was important to adjust the temperature during sludge thermal hydrolysis to control the formation of refractory components 3 1 2 distribution of has in hydrolyzed sludge although large amounts of has in sludge were released into the supernatant by thermal hydrolysis most of the has still existed in the solid phase and kept at inert states as shown in fig 2 almost all of the has in raw sludge were in the solid phase with the increase of hydrolysis temperature has in sludge tended to transform from the solid phase to the liquid phase but their concentrations in liquid phase would no longer increase and even slightly decrease as the hydrolysis temperature reached a certain level such as over 180 c moreover during the thermal hydrolysis there appeared to be a loss in the total amount of has in sludge which should be attributed to the larger amount of decomposed has than generated at excessively high temperatures wang et al 2020 also reported has were transformed to other organics such as fulvic acids char or tar yang et al 2016 also observed a mutual conversion between humic and fulvic acids during the thermal hydrolysis process however with the further increase of hydrolysis temperature the content of has in solid seemed to keep stable relatively thus it indicated that the chemical structure of has in the solid phase was rather stable and decomposition of has mainly happened in the liquid phase furthermore it is worth to be noted that besides the changes in concentrations has structure also kept evolving with the increase of hydrolysis temperature possibly making has more inhibitory to sludge digestion in particular with hydrolysis process during the ad liu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 therefore the results evidently indicated that thermal hydrolysis indeed induced the increase in concentrations and changes in structure of soluble has in sludge which presumably leads to potential inhibitory impacts to sludge ad liu et al 2015 li et al 2019a 3 1 3 response of has release to hydrolysis temperature the amount of released has in the supernatant overall increased with the enhancement of hydrolysis temperature but the production or release rate of the has changed greatly in different ranges of hydrolysis temperature in order to elucidate the mathematical relationship between the hydrolysis temperature and the release of has the range of low and medium temperatures was classified in the same group as shown in fig 3 during thermal hydrolysis the changes of dissolved has concentration presented evidently linear correlation with increase of the hydrolysis temperature p 0 05 when the temperature was below 140 c the concentrations of soluble has gradually increased with the enhancement of hydrolysis temperature and their coefficient k was 1 2067 when the temperature increased from 140 to 180 c has concentration sharply increased and the rate coefficient k was rapidly raised to 14 06 however further enhancing hydrolysis temperature the release rate of has started to slow down possibly corresponding with has conversions into other substances through decomposition and condensation current thermal pretreatments for sludge digestion could be roughly divided into moderate and high temperature hydrolysis the latter has already been widely used in full scale projects under temperatures of 140 180 c thus the results further confirmed the significance of focusing on the potential impacts of has release and conversion on sludge hydrolysis especially in the range of 140 180 c 3 2 altered chemical structure of has during thermal hydrolysis 3 2 1 changes in aromatic condensation aromatic condensation of has could be used to positively characterize their contents of hydrophobic portions with high molecular weight such as aromatic acids and phenol liu et al 2015 reported has with high hydrophobicity could improve solubilization of sludge particulate organic matter just like the function of surfactant by accelerating the dissolutions of organic compounds in sludge and maintaining the activity of hydrolase moreover it also reported that aromatic condensation of has was positively related to their redox potential of the quinone groups li et al 2019a aromatic condensation of has is inversely proportional to the ratio of e4 e6 chen et al 1977 has with low e4 e6 ratio are difficult to be decomposed during ad li et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 thermal hydrolysis at medium or low temperature such as 100 c resulted in the decrease of aromatic condensation degree of has in sludge while high temperature such as 160 200 c caused the enhancement of has aromatic condensation comparing with wnhas the control a slight increase of e4 e6 ratio happened in the has extracted from the hydrolyzed sludge under 100 c 100 c has which was likely ascribed to the breakage of the aromatic rings during hydrolytic process rodriguez et al 2016 however with further increase of temperature e4 e6 ratio of has in the hydrolyzed sludge tended to decrease substantially and the aromatic condensation of sludge has reached the maximum at the temperature of 200 c therefore the results indicated thermal hydrolysis induce the changes of has structure and make the has more aggressive to sludge digestion however most of recent publications merely focus on the influences of has concentration during sludge digestion which is likely to underestimate the effect of has 3 2 2 changes in elemental composition elemental composition is also an important indicator of has biochemical activity which can be used to analyze the change law of has structure during sludge thermal hydrolysis and predict their influences on ad for example hernandez et al 1988 reported that nitrogen content in has was positively relative to the contents of amino acids and microorganism tissue which had good bioavailability as shown in table 1 the content of nitrogen in has was sharply reduced by the increased temperature therefore the results indicated that with the enhancement of thermal hydrolysis temperature has not only underwent changes and or migrations of functional group and an increase in aromaticity but also in essence the overall bioavailability of has decreased moreover the result could be further confirmed by the decreased h c ratio in has with the increase of sludge hydrolysis temperature as shown in table 1 garcía et al 1992 and fernandes et al 2015 reported that the ratio of h c 1 represented the high aromatic condensation furthermore the changes in elemental composition reflected the variations of functional group structure the c n ratio was negatively relative to the content of aliphatic n and positively relative to that of heterocyclic structures hernandez et al 1988 li et al 2014 as shown in table 1 the ratio of c n rapidly increased with the enhancement of hydrolysis temperature mainly due to the formation of n substituted glycosylamine by the condensation reactions between amino acids and sugars therefore the analysis of elemental composition indicated that as the temperature increased the has structure tended to be stable and the biodegradability would decrease 3 2 3 changes in functional groups the functional groups of has in pretreated sludge were also changed during thermal hydrolysis the characteristics of infrared spectra of the soluble has were shown in fig 5 comparing with the control and pretreated sludge under 100 c soluble has extracted from the hydrolysate of the pretreated sludge under 160 c 160 c has tended to have fewer functional groups which were mainly composed of three bond functional groups cc and concentrated at near wavenumber amir et al 2010 as temperature increased the types of functional groups increased and the groups were gradually dominated by single bond functional groups the spectra of the soluble has extracted from pretreated sludge under 180 c 180 c has showed a high band intensity at 1650 amide i 1230 and 1260 cm 1 cn stretching carboxyl group oh bending the results indicated high contents of amides ethers and esters that is the oxidation of this has was relatively low tristan et al 2018 as the hydrolysis temperature continuously increased up to 200 and 220 c the amount and intensity of the peaks in spectra obviously increased possibly because of decomposition reactions therefore the results indicated that as the hydrolysis temperature increased the abundance of functional group types in the has extracted from the pretreated sludge decreased firstly and then increased simultaneously accompanying with the changes in the total amount and structure of functional groups 3 3 influences of has release on sludge ad 3 3 1 inhibition of has with enhanced concentration to sludge fermentation for vfas production sludge fermentation for vfas production were severely inhibited by the enhancement of soluble has concentrations as shown in fig 6 a when the has concentration was just elevated by 0 2 g l the total vfas concentration decreased to the half of that of the control from 9800 to 4800 mg l moreover the total vfas concentration presented a sharp decrease over the further increase of has concentrations the results obtained in this study differ from that observed reports for example liu et al 2015 reported vfas production from sludge hydrolysis was accelerated due to the increase of has concentration however it was interestingly found that the humic substances reported to be inhibitory were mainly from the extracts of soil sludge landfill leachate and maize etc whereas those beneficial to ad were mainly fossil or commercial liang et al 2021 the influences of has on sludge hydrolysis are not only related to their concentrations but also related to their structure as mentioned above the mechanisms of influences of has on sludge digestion mainly include bundling electron shuttling microbial regulation and metal complexation li et al 2019a as shown in fig 6b the increase of has concentration presented no obvious impact on the composition of vfas production from anaerobic fermentation of sludge the dosage of has increased from 0 to 1 0 g l acetate kept being the predominant vfas component in each group and accounted for 53 85 followed by propionate which accounted for 5 10 isobutyrate butyrate isovalerate valerate caproate heptanoate were almost around 4 followed by a few caprylate thus the results indicated the increase of has concentration presumably had little influence on the composition of the microbial community and its metabolic pathways li et al 2021 azman et al 2017 meanwhile given that the content of heavy metal in the sludge used in this study was very low the role of has in complexation with metal ions was limited furthermore via electron transfer the hydrolysis of organics in sludge could often be enhanced liu et al 2013 liu et al 2015 therefore the main inhibition mechanism of has on sludge hydrolysis should be the bundling of has with functional enzymes and substrates 3 3 2 inhibition of has with altered structure to fermentation for vfas production the inhibition of has to sludge hydrolysis was related to not only their concentrations but also their structural characteristics as shown in fig 7 their effects on acidification rate from glucose fermentation varied greatly between has with the same concentrations but obtained from different sludge hydrolysates except for the has extracted from 160 c hydrolyzed sludge all of other has presented inhibitory effects on glucose fermentation and their inhibition became more acute with the increase of has concentrations though the half inhibitory concentrations of each has were different most of the has were around 0 4 g l however significant differences existed in inhibition degree between different has to glucose fermentation as shown in fig 7 under the same concentrations has extracted from the raw sludge wnhas and medium temperature pretreated sludge 100 c has seemed more inhibitory than other has extracted from high temperature pretreated sludge samples namely 160 c has 180 c has 200 c has and 220 c has especially at low concentration of 0 2 g l the addition of 160 c has improved vfas production from glucose fermentation the observed phenomenon possibly was attributed to the enhanced stability of has structure during the increase of hydrolysis temperature moreover correlation analysis was implemented to quantify the influences of has structural characteristics on their inhibition to hydrolysis of organics considering the several main structural characteristics aforementioned as shown in table 2 the influence of has structural characteristics could be neglected at low concentration of 0 2 g l but become more and more significant with the increase of has concentration e4 e6 and c n ratios presented significant correlation p 0 05 with the inhibition of hydrolysis of organics when has concentration was 0 4 g l however as has concentration increased some structural features such as c h of has always showed no significant correlation with has inhibition to the hydrolysis of organics thus the results indicated that release of has by thermal hydrolysis inhibited biodegradation of the organics during sludge digestion the performance of the ad process was evidently related to has concentration and structural characteristics and within a certain concentration range quantitative relationships between has structural characteristics and the inhibition to the biodegradation of organic matter are demonstrated 3 3 3 influences of released has on methanogenic ad sludge ad for methane production was promoted by has at low concentration and inhibited at high concentration as shown in fig 8 methane production was firstly promoted when has concentration in the reactors was less than 1 0 g l however the enhancement in ch4 production seemingly reached the peak at the concentration of has of about 0 8 g l and then tended to decline moreover when has concentration further increased to 2 0 4 0 g l sludge ad was heavily inhibited and the cumulative methane production was only about half of that of the control group as shown in fig 8 the daily ch4 production in each test sharply increased until they reached the maximum but the tests at low has concentration 0 0 6 g l reached their peaks four days earlier day 4 than other tests with has concentration of 0 8 1 0 g l with the further increase of ha dosage up to 2 0 4 0 g l the daily methane production reached the maximum on day 11 and has caused a lag phase in daily methane peaks therefore the results indicated that the mechanisms of the influences of has on sludge ad were likely multiple and could be roughly divided into two distinct types one boosting methane production and the other inhibiting methane methanogenesis for example azman et al 2017 reported has could inhibit sludge ad by binding hydrolase but li et al 2019a found has could promote sludge ad by facilitating electron transfer under low concentrations the contribution of has to sludge ad was greater than inhibition whereas under high concentrations vice versa methane production from sludge ad included hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis the presence of has at low concentrations evidently promoted acetoclastic methanogenesis as shown in fig 9 almost at all levels of has concentrations the processes of methane production from acetate digestion were clearly boosted and methane production was enhanced significantly as the content of has increased however some divergences among different has were also observed the has from raw sludge and sludge pretreated at a medium temperature showed stronger promotion effects to methanogenesis than that of has from sludge pretreated at a high temperature for example has extracted from hydrolyzed sludge under 160 c 160 c has improved biogas production by nearly 200 while 200 c has did not evidently strengthen methane production liu et al 2015 found the introduction of commercial has during sludge digestion affected methane production namely no noticeable influence on hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis but a clear inhibition to aceticlastic methanogenesis the inhibitory effect was closely related to the characteristics of the commercial has the mechanisms of influences of has on methanogenesis were mainly contributed to their competition with some key enzymes for electrons therefore the different results observed in this study possibly are linked to that fact that the structural characteristics of has extracted from sludge determined their ability to gain and give electrons which was presumably different from the characteristics of the commercial has 3 3 4 influence of released has on enzymatic activity the increase of has concertation inhibited the activity of hydrolytic protease but promoted the activity of the key enzymes for methanogenesis as depicted in fig 10 after about 5 days operation at has concentration of 0 6 g l the activity of proteinase was decreased by 20 while the activity of co enzyme f420 was increased to 119 in the reactors for anaerobic digestion of the sludge has are defined as a cluster of organic compounds with different molecular sizes has with large molecules might be rejected by cell structure and accumulated outside the cell of the fermenting bacteria inhibiting the activity of extracellular hydrolase through binding x w li et al 2013 fernandes et al 2015 while has with small molecules could pass through the cell membrane and facilitate in electron transfer to increase the activity of methanogenesis enzymes the statement could also explain the observed phenomenon of influences of has on sludge ad at high has concentrations extracellular hydrolase possibly became inactivated by combining with has that abundantly existed outside of microorganism cells while inside of the cells due to the saturation of has their contributions in electron transfer were presumably no longer increased with their concentrations however at relatively low concentrations the inhibitory effect of has to extracellular enzymes was limited which could be readily offset by their contributions on promotion of methanogenesis via electron transfer 3 4 mechanisms analysis the effect of has on sludge ad is the result of a combination of multiple mechanisms include bundling electron shuttling and microbial regulation based on the results obtained in this paper it can be seen that has under low concentration could bind the dissolved organic matter and extracellular enzymes reducing the sludge acidification efficiency however the cell walls of bacteria would prevent the macromolecular has passing through the cells thus the inhibition on intracellular methanogenesis enzymes can be ignored although has with small molecule could pass through the cell membrane the effect of binding enzymes was not significant since the binding of has to enzymes acted like that of cellulose furthermore has with small molecule participated in electron transferring enhancing the activity of methanogenesis enzymes therefore has under low concentration would inhibit vfas production but improve methane production however has under high concentration could inhibit both acidification and methanogenesis the former inhibition was caused by the bundle of has to substrates and enzymes and the latter inhibition was probably related to the bunch of has to methanogens and dissolved organic matter during ad 4 conclusions has release and their influences on sludge ad with thp seemingly are underestimated which are likely to be the causes to low methane yield results of this study presented an insight into the evolutions of has in sludge during thp and proposed a new concept of synergistically interfering the ad via has concentration and structural characteristics the following remarks are concluded 1 has release from sludge can be accelerated with the increase of hydrolysis temperature the concentration of soluble has substantially increased from 8 mg l in raw sludge to 727 mg l in the pretreated sludge hydrolyzed at 180 c 2 chemical structure of has was severely altered during sludge thp has extracted from sludge hydrolyzed at 200 c presented the largest aromatic condensation degree functional groups of 160 chas were mainly composed of unsaturated bonds but as hydrolysis temperature raised bonds in the functional groups began to break and single bond substances formed 3 acidification rate was inhibited by over 50 with 0 4 g l of has besides the concentration increases changes of has structural characteristics also play an important role on their influences on sludge digestion in particular the e4 e6 and c n ratios of has had a significant correlation with the inhibition to vfas production during sludge anaerobic fermentation 4 sludge ad for methane production was promoted by has at low concentration below 1 0 g l and inhibited at high concentration over 2 0 g l and the extent of the effect was also closely relative to the structural characteristics of has the increase of has concentration in sludge ad inhibited the activity of hydrolytic protease but promoted the activity of the key enzymes for methanogenesis the activities of proteinase and co enzyme f420 were decreased by 20 and increased by 19 respectively with has at 0 6 g l for 5 days 5 due to the rate limiting step was methanogenesis in the ad process of pretreated sludge by thermal hydrolysis has concentration was recommended at low level for example around 1 0 g l to accelerate or not limit methanogenesis

16848,the combination of co ii and peracetic acid paa is a promising advanced oxidation process for the abatement of refractory organic contaminants and acetylperoxy ch3co3 and acetoxyl ch3co2 radicals are generally recognized as the dominant and selective intermediate oxidants however the role of high valent cobalt oxo species co iv have been overlooked herein we confirmed that co ii paa reaction enables the generation of co iv at acidic conditions based on multiple lines of evidences including methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso based probe experiments 18o isotope labeling technique and in situ raman spectroscopy in depth investigation reveals that the paa oxidation mechanism is strongly ph dependent the elevation of solution ph could induce major oxidants converting from co iv to oxygen centered radicals i e ch3co3 and ch3co2 the presence of h2o2 competitively consumes both co iv and reactive radicals generated from co ii paa process and thus leading to an undesirably decline in catalytic performance additionally as a highly reactive and selective oxidant co iv reacts readily with organic substances bearing electron rich groups and efficiently attenuating their biological toxicity our findings enrich the fundamental understanding of co ii and paa reaction and will be useful for the application of co iv mediated processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cobalt ii ion peracetic acid high valent cobalt oxo nonradical oxidation process 1 introduction peracetic acid paa is an organic peroxyacid that has been extensively applied in medical food and textile industries cai et al 2017 da silva et al 2020 kitis 2004 rokhina et al 2010 as a promising disinfectant it has also received increasing attention in the field of water and wastewater treatment owing to its easy retrofit high disinfection efficiency and negligible formation of harmful disinfection byproducts ao et al 2021 campo et al 2020 chen et al 2019 manoli et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 however paa itself can only decompose a small fraction of contaminants with specific structures which remarkably limits its practical application potential kim et al 2020 kim and huang 2021 rizzo et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 activation of paa by catalysts or externally supplied energy is deemed as an effective strategy to strength the efficiency of pollutants removal cai et al 2017 kim et al 2020 2019 wang et al 2020b 2020e zhou et al 2015 the enhanced oxidizing property is mainly derived from its generation of highly reactive radicals such as acetylperoxy ch3co3 acetoxyl ch3co2 and hydroxyl radicals oh in addition the estimated peroxide oo bond energy of paa 38 kcal mol 1 is inferior to that of commonly used oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide h2o2 51 kcal mol 1 and peroxymonosulfate pms 76 kcal mol 1 bokare and choi 2014 indicating that paa can potentially lead to more reactive oxidizing species ros generation with lower energy requirement which is of great significance for

evaluated the ros in co ii pms process they strikingly found the yield of pmso2 was always close to 100 in the process at acidic conditions and the involvements of high valent cobalt oxo species co iv was thus strongly suggested zong et al 2020 this research is of great significance and breaks through the fundamental understanding of co ii pms reaction considering the similar nature of paa and pms we speculated that co ii could also activate paa via nonradical route to generate co iv as a matter of fact co iv species were widely studied and implicated as pivotal intermediates beyond the environmental field such as intermetal oxygen atom transfer alkane hydroxylation and olefin epoxidation reaction kanan et al 2009 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 comparably the potential application of co iv for wastewater remediation have been studied only limitedly moreover to the best of our knowledge the engagement of co iv species in the co iv paa system has never been discoursed and is still ambiguous in this work for the first time we corroborated the paa simulated two electron conversion of co ii to co iv rather than radicals generation under acidic conditions several strategies were integrated to identify the occurrence of co iv including pmso based probe 18o labeled experiments and in situ raman spectra then the reactivity of co iv towards several representative pollutants

pmso2 were generated during co ii paa oxidation moreover it should be noted that the used paa solutions contain co existing h2o2 in this work and the molar ratio of paa h2o2 is 1 24 thus the h2o2 background concentration was 81 μm when the paa concentration was 100 μm to evaluate the role of h2o2 the conversion of pmso was monitored in the coexistence of co ii and h2o2 under comparable conditions as depicted in fig s2 pmso was not degraded even under the much higher concentration of total peroxides i e 1 mm h2o2 indicating minor contribution of the co existing h2o2 to the transformation of pmso in co ii paa process the insignificant reaction of h2o2 and co ii is in good accordance with literature reports that co ii ion is an ineffective catalyst for h2o2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 ling et al 2010 this discrepancy can be ascribed to the higher peroxide oo bond energy as mentioned above and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy of h2o2 kim et al 2019 in fact co ii could be a potentially effective activator for h2o2 only when the coordination involves suitable ligands chen et al 2012 thus it can be deduced that the conversion of pmso was stem from the activation of paa by co ii 3 2 identification of working oxidants for pmso conversion 3 2 1 probing oh oh is a common species for the degradation of contaminants in metal catalytic aops to identify the occurrence of oh in co ii paa system dmpo trapped epr spectroscopies were conducted one can observe that no signal was detected for co ii and paa alone comparatively a legible signal of dmpo oh adduct with αn αh 14 9 g appeared in the co ii paa system fig 2 a this signal is generally corresponded to a signature for the presence of oh nonetheless it is reported that the unique reaction between high valence metal e g fe iv wang et al 2018 cu iii wang et al 2020c mn vii xu et al 2017 and co iv liu et al 2021 zong et al 2020 and water could also led to the generation of dmpo oh adducts via the forrester hepburn mechanism jing and chaplin 2017 sugden and wetterhahn 1996 in other words the detection of dmpo oh adducts is not formed solely from oh to make it clear tba was involved as the oh quenching agents k oh tba 3 8 to 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2020b wang et al 2019b as depicted in fig 2b the signal intensity of dmpo oh only slight suppression upon the addition of excessive tba this phenomenon was in stark contrast to the fenton process a oh benchmark system where the presence of tba induced the dmpo oh signal to be strongly diminished consequently the generation dmpooh adduct in co ii paa process should not be ascribed to oh but to other interpretation presumably due to the nucleophilic addition of water in the presence of co iv or inverted spin trapping this conclusion was also supported by the result of classical scavenging experiments as shown in fig s3 tba fail to produce an obvious inhibition on pmso degradation confirming the contribution of oh is negligible more importantly previous studies indicated that the pmso is vulnerable towards oh attack and can only convert pmso to hydroxylating products rather than pmso2 dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018 which was also inconsistent with the above obtained result fig 1 collectively it can be conclude that oh played minor role in pmso conversion during the co ii paa oxidation 3 2 2 probing singlet oxygen 1o2 in some paa based catalytic systems 1o2 was generally considered as a potential ros which endows the ability to oxidize sulfoxides to sulfones edwards et al 1979 temp is reported to be a special spin trapping agent for the discrimination of 1o2 as shown in fig 2c a typical triplet signal of temp 1o2 with equal intensities was detected in paa solution evidencing the presence of 1o2 this result was consistent with previous findings that paa could self decompose and release a certain amount of 1o2 evans and upton 1985 however it was very interesting the intensity of these triplet signals appeared in co ii paa process were comparable to that generated in paa alone indicating that the generation of 1o2 was independent upon the introduction of co ii given there was no obvious degradation of pmso in paa alone 1o2 plays a negligible role in converting pmso to pmso2 during co ii paa oxidation fig s1 this conclusion was further supported by the solvent exchange h2o to d2o results given the lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 22 70 μs was more than 10 fold longer than that in h2o 2 9 4 6 μs gorman and rodgers 1981 yang et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 which should kinetically accelerate the oxidation in 1o2 involved process however the pmso degradation and pmso2 generation by co ii paa was barely impacted in absolute d2o fig s4 revealing that 1o2 was not responsible for pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in co ii paa process 3 2 3 contribution of oxygen centered radicals r o it has been recognized that reactive oxygen centered radicals r o such as ch3co2 and ch3co3 were formed during the co ii paa oxidation at neutral condition and perform well in selectively removing various organic contaminants kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020e to examine whether r o contributes to the destruction of pmso under acidic conditions the degradation of pmso was conducted in uv paa process photolysis of paa solutions at 254 nm was used to generation r o and the formed oh was quenched by adding excess tba as shown in fig 2d the comparison between uv alone and uv tba exhibited that the pmso degradation under uv alone was hardly suppressed after adding tba suggesting the modest abatement of pmso under uv irradiation was primarily attributed to direct photolysis comparison between uv paa with or without tba showed that tba introduction only slight inhibited pmso degradation by uv paa evidencing that r o generated from the uv paa process were dominant radicals contributed to pmso destruction instead of oh nevertheless no pmso2 production was observed during uv paa process the results appeared to suggest that r o was reactive to pmso but cannot oxidize pmso to pmso2 to gain more credible evidence the transformation products of pmso of uv paa process were investigated using hplc qtof ms according to the condensed dual descriptor the most negative positions of pmso pmso2 were located at para carbon of benzene ring suggesting that they are the most favorable sites for the electrophilic attack thus the oxidation products of pmso and pmso2 by r o are proposed as para compounds table s2 and fig s6 as listed in table s2 besides the hydroxylated products presumably due to either the direct photolysis or hydrogen atom abstraction by peroxyl radicals three extra products p 183 c8h8o3s p 185 c8h10o3s and p 197 c9h10o3s were detected in extracted ion chromatogram eic at retention time of 2 50 3 22 and 3 99 min respectively however no signal of psmo2 was detected in the process it should be carefully noted that the absence of pmso2 could be attributed two distinct reasons i the reaction between r o and pmso does not produce pmso2 and ii the generated pmso2 is rapidly oxidized to intermediates by r o which was supported by the moderate degradation of pmso2 in uv paa process fig s5 to further make it clear the oxidation products of pmso2 were also identified table s1 as could be seen besides pmso2 three additional products p 156 c6h6o3s p 171 c7h8o3s and p 201 c9h10o4s were observed comparatively these products were not detected in the case of pmso during uv paa process fig s7 these results essentially rule out the involvement of r o in oxidizing pmso to pmso2 moreover considering the η pmso2 values remained steady at approximately 100 r o marginally contributed to the degradation of pmso at given experimental condition 3 2 4 evidence of co iv generation in co ii paa process other than the aforementioned oxidants it was reported that co ii or co ii complexes can react with peroxides e g pms and h2o2 via two electron transfer to produce co iv initiating a nonradical oxidation of organics similar to other high valent metal oxo species barats damatov et al 2014 dong et al 2020b li et al 2018a wang et al 2018 zong et al 2020 the water soluble sulfoxides could be quantitatively converted to corresponding sulfones through the oxygen atom transfer mechanism this signature behavior is agreed well with the observation of the pmso conversion during co ii paa oxidation therefore we hypothesize that co iv could be the working oxidant in the co ii paa process to verify this hypothesis some solid evidence should be provided co iv is highly unstable and challenging to trap and characterize it was reported that the intermetal coo bond could undergo oxygen atom exchange reaction with solvent water hohenberger et al 2012 pestovsky et al 2005 wang et al 2019c thus if co iv was the main working oxidant for pmso conversion during co ii paa oxidation 18o isotope labeling product ought to detected when the reaction system was carried over into h18o matrix as expected upon introduction of h2 18o the extracted ion chromatogram eic exhibits two prominent peaks for m z 155 0172 and m z 157 0216 with the same retention time fig 3 a the mass and isotope distribution patterns of m z 155 0172 corresponds to pms16o16o calcd m z 155 0172 the presence of two mass unit shift of m z 157 0216 corresponds to pms18o16o calcd m z 157 0213 indicating the successful incorporation of the 18o into the pmso2 meanwhile the characteristic fragments of pms16o16o also showed the m z value shift of two mass units fig 3b besides the control experiment with pms16o16o alone in h2 18o revealed no production of pms16o18o excluding the possible oxygen atom exchange between pms16o16o and h2 18o fig s8 hence the formation of 18o isotope labeling pmso2 provided a conclusive evidence for the generation of co iv in the co ii paa process additional credible evidence was discovered by in situ raman spectra fresh co ii alone show three spectral features were visible at 451 622 and 1110 cm 1 when co ii interacted with paa several fresh vibration bands appeared fig 3e the most notable feature is the appearance of the strong isotope sensitive peaks at 394 and 810 cm 1 when h2 18o was used the difference feature at 394 426 cm 1 can reasonable be assigned to diatomic coo oscillator hohenberger et al 2012 a signature of terminal coo bond fig 3c since observed isotopic shift of its 16δ 18δ value 32 cm 1 is closed to calculated value of δv 34 cm 1 similar red shift was also observed in oxygen evolution reaction on cobalt oxyhydroxide moysiadou et al 2020 suggesting the presence of co iv species in addition the vibrational frequency at 810 cm 1 could be ascribed to the oo harmonic oscillator stem from the formation of co ii paa complex fig 3d the position of the band is comparable to that of side on cobalt peroxo complexes such as co iii 12 tmc o2 and co iii 13 tmc o2 shin et al 2016 cho et al 2010 the result further lend strong credence to the intermediacy of co iv during co ii paa oxidation 3 3 influencing factors 3 3 1 effects of paa and co ii dosages to gain more information about the generation of co iv in the co ii paa process the effects of co ii dosages on the conversion of pmso 100 μm by the co ii paa process were examined at ph0 3 5 while fixing paa 0 at 500 μm as shown the rate for pmso degradation was increased with increasing co ii dosage from 10 to 200 μm and a kinetic plateau was reached as co ii 0 was further increased 500 μm fig 4 a correspondingly the production of pmso2 followed the same trend varying from 10 to 500 μm fig s9 such saturation kinetics associated with co ii dosage were in stark contrast to the fe iv based process which the competitive depletion of fe iv by fe ii was relatively noteworthy jacobsen et al 1998 pestovsky and bakac 2004 conversely the distinct behavior in the co ii paa process implies that the side reaction between co iv and co ii was rather limited the effect of paa dosages was investigated while co ii 0 was fixed at 100 μm pmso removal rate increased from 0 03 to 0 19 min 1 when paa concentration was increased for 0 10 to 1 0 mm however it was observed that further increasing paa 0 to 10 0 mm triggered dramatically inhibition of pmso degradation and pmso2 production fig 4b and fig s9 these results indicated that the competitive depletion of co iv by paa or h2o2 was much stronger than that by co ii 3 3 2 effect of h2o2 considering the coexistence of h2o2 in the paa solution the extra h2o2 was added into co ii paa solution to investigate the impacts of h2o2 in the conversion of pmso by co ii paa oxidation the possible reactions between paa and h2o2 at the given experiment conditions was excluded since the decay of paa only varied insignificantly with the initial h2o2 concentration fig s10 fig s11 shows that the addition of extra h2o2 1 0 mm at an initial paa dos of 500 μm led to the completely inhibition of pmso degradation the result implies that the increased concentration of h2o2 didn t responsible for the enhancement of overall pmso conversion with the elevation of paa dose on the other hand the decrease in pmso oxidation efficiency by additionally h2o2 suggested the possible scavenging of co iv by h2o2 to further ascertain whether h2o2 competitively consumes of co iv the effects of additionally h2o2 on pmso conversion was monitored using co ii pms as reference system as co iv has been proved as the major oxidant during co ii pms oxidation under acidic conditions liu et al 2021 zong et al 2020 it can be seen from fig s12 the degradation of pmso was evidently blocked by h2o2 clearly evidencing the significant consumption of co iv by h2o2 in addition the introduction of horseradish peroxidase in the co ii paa process with high paa concentration induced considerable promotion on pmso oxidation efficiency fig s13 suggesting the competitive depletion of co iv by h2o2 should exceed than that of paa eqs 1 and 2 1 c h 3 c o ooh 2 c o iv o 2 c h 3 c o o 2 c o 3 o h o 2 2 h 2 o 2 2 c o iv o 2 h o 2 2 c o 3 o h strikingly it was also noticed that the calculated η pmso2 gradually decreased from 95 8 to 51 9 with increasing paa dosage from 0 5 mm to 10 0 mm fig s19 the result means that co iv was not the sole oxidants account for pmso degradation at high paa concentration and the contributions of r o should be considered as reported previously the thermodynamically favorable reactions between h2o2 and r o leads to the generation ho2 eqs 3 and 4 kim et al 2020 2019 wang et al 2020e when generated ho2 o2 can scavenge ch3co3 at relatively high kinetic efficiency and thus resulting in slowing down pmso degradation eq 5 in this regard the increase of paa dose can not only accelerate the generation of ros i e co iv and r o but also strength the consumption of ros the decline in η pmso2 with the increase of paa was consistent with the foregoing inference that the reaction between co iv and h2o2 is more significant than that paa in addition given the degradation of pmso shows negative relationship under high paa dose which suggests that the scavenging effect of higher h2o2 concentration exceeds the improvement of generated ros via the elevation of paa concentration in the current system 3 c h 3 c o 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o 2 h h o 2 4 c h 3 c o 3 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o 3 h h o 2 5 c h 3 c o 3 h o 2 c h 3 c o 3 h o 2 3 3 3 effect of solution ph subsequently in order to disclose the major ros generated in the co paa system under vary ph exceeding 3 5 the transformation of pmso were estimated over the ph range from 4 0 8 0 as shown in fig 4c the abatement of pmso and formation of pmso2 decreased progressively as the ph values rose up specifically the removal of pmso dropped drastically from maximum 88 7 μm at ph 3 5 to 19 9 μm at ph 6 correspondingly the production of pmso2 were dropped from 85 9 μm at ph 3 5 to 18 1 μm at ph 6 0 nevertheless the calculated η pmso2 was always close to 100 at ph 3 5 6 0 indicating the dominant role of co iv in the co ii paa system under acidic conditions in contrast under neutral conditions the loss of pmso and production of pmso2 was unremarkable considering the direct reaction between pmso and paa could also induce insignificant generation of pmso2 fig s1 which make it hard to distinguish the role of co iv or paa at low pmso concentration nonetheless when a higher initial concentration of pmso 2 mm was used in the co ii paa process the production of pmso2 was always over those in controls without co ii fig s14 this result evidences that co iv was implicated in the co ii paa process at circumneutral conditions noteworthy it has been proved that r o are the dominant oxidants under neutral conditions while exert negligible role under acidic conditions in the co ii paa process therefore it is inferred that ph might induced a mechanistic changeover from one to two electron transfer to substantiate this cbz and smx degradation experiments were conducted as reported previously cbz readily reacts with co iv but it is resistant to oxidation by r o while smx is susceptible to oxidation by both co iv and r o cai et al 2017 rayaroth et al 2019 wang et al 2020b from fig s15 one can observe that the decay ratio of cbz was suppressed from 84 5 to 1 2 as the increase of ph from 3 5 to 7 0 indicating that the generation of co iv was narrowed with solution ph in contrast the abatement of smx was obviously accelerated with the elevation of solution ph fig s15 the promoted degradation efficiency is likely because of the relatively higher reaction rate of smx with r o than that of co iv wang et al 2020e further the presence of excess dmso discernibly restrained cbz and smx removal at acidic condition while produced no obvious inhibition under neutral medium these observations were consistent with the deduction that the primary intermediate oxidants from co ii paa process were converted from co iv to r o with the elevation of solution ph this ph dependent oxidation behavior may be related to the alteration in paa speciation considering the pk a of paa is 8 2 neutral and alkaline conditions could make a favorable platform to produce dissociated species of paa paa the oo bond length of the paa ch3c o oo molecules is estimated to be 1 454 å which is longer that of neutral species of paa0 1 444 å fig s16 thus the paa0 is more difficult to break the oo bond and generate free radicals this conclusion can be further supported by the energy gap between lumo and highest occupied molecular orbital homo analysis as shown the lumo homo gap of paa0 7 54 ev is much higher than that of paa 4 88 ev implying that one electron transfer from co ii to paa is easier than that to paa0 because of the low energy barrier fig 4d this is also consistent with the fact that paa is a stronger reductant than paa0 alternatively the potential reaction pathways involve proton transfer along with the subsequent oo bond cleavage may be more thermodynamically favorable in the case of paa0 as analogous to co ii pms process zong et al 2020 3 4 proposed mechanism on the basis of the above results and discussion the possible mechanism for the generation of ros in co ii paa system is inferred analogy to fe ii h2o2 and co ii pms system bataineh et al 2012 zong et al 2020 the co ii first coordinates with paa by an inner sphere water exchange mechanism resulting in the generation of co ii paa complex under acidic conditions the formed transient complex prone to dissociate through a two electron transfer producing co iv eqs 6 and 7 at neutral conditions the peroxo oo bond cleavage switches from heterolytic to homolytic and thus leading to the main ros switch from co iv to various r o the one electron transfer pathway of co ii paa activation process is fairly well understood in literatures and the kinetic model are postulated as following eq 8 and 9 kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020e 6 co ii c h 3 c o ooh co ii c h 3 c o ooh complex 7 co ii c h 3 c o ooh complex co iv c h 3 c o o h 8 co ii c h 3 c o ooh co iii c h 3 c o o o h 9 co iii c h 3 c o ooh co ii c h 3 c o o o h 3 5 reactivity of co iv 3 5 1 degradation of various contaminants in co ii paa system the reactivity of co iv towards typical environmental micropollutants was also evaluated under the condition of paa 0 100 μm organics 0 10 μm and co ii 0 10 μm 0 59 mg l 1 less than the permissible limit of 1 mg l 1 based on the chinese national standard gb 25 467 2010 li et al 2018b from fig 5 a no obvious degradation of benzoic acid ba was observed and 20 atrazine atz and ibuprofen ibp were abated with 30 min cbz was moderately degraded with the decay ratio of 84 5 at 30 min in contrast under identical conditions a complete elimination of bisphenol a bpa and smx were realized within 15 min and 20 min respectively paa and co ii alone caused negligible influence on the degradation of these organic contaminants the above results suggest that co iv could oxidize various organic contaminants with varying efficiencies similar selective catalytic degradation of pollutants was also occurred in several nonradical systems in previous studies bokare and choi 2015 hu et al 2017 yun et al 2017 to disclose substrate specificity of co iv relationships of ionization potential ip values with respect to degradation rate constants of organics were evaluated generally electron rich groups e g amido and hydroxyl can lower ip of the compounds whereas electron withdrawn groups e g nitryl and carboxyl exert an adverse trend as shown in fig 5b it was found that there may be an ip threshold at 6 0 ev assigning to the oxidative ability of co iv to react with pollutants ba atz and ibp with higher ip values than threshold were barely oxidized in co ii paa process since the relatively weak redox potential of co iv in contrast the contaminants with a low ip values were vulnerable to be oxidized with high reactivity such selective catalytic oxidation dependent upon ip values have also been reported for ozone 1o2 and fe iv li et al 2013b ye et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 3 5 2 products evaluation and toxicity prediction the transformation products of representative contaminants i e smx cbz and bpa were determined to further clarify the interaction between contaminants and co iv fig 6 and table s3 it was reported that the oxidation patterns of high valent metal oxo moieties including electron transfer hydrogen abstraction and oxygen atom transfer which is highly specific to the structures of substances blakemore et al 2015 engelmann et al 2016 for all three compounds hydroxylation and or oxygenation intermediates were produced i e m z of 268 0391 300 0285 224 0705 269 0911 243 1027 for smx cbz and bpa respectively these hydroxylated products could be generated from the electron transfer reaction by co iv additional products of smx included m z of 258 0385 282 0914 and 172 0055 are proposed to be oxidated via an oxygen atom transfer route the 99 0557 and 172 0055 products could be related to the cleavage of ns bond which subsequently led to the generation of hydroxylation products notably the n radical coupling products were regarded as the oxidation products of smx induced by r o wang et al 2020b 2020e yet these products were not detected in this work further demonstrating the negligible contribution from r o in the co ii paa process under acidic conditions fig s17 for cbz the epoxidation derivative m z of 253 0973 was first formed and the epoxide ring was further split to generate the ring contracted intermediate m z of 271 1073 through the pinacol type rearrangement li et al 2013a additional products of 210 0915 and 198 0754 could be formed by hydroxylation from heterocyclic ring with the lose an acylamino and a keto group respectively fig s18 besides bpa also underwent demethylation to form hydroperoxyl product i e m z of 245 0816 the 151 0762 and 149 0608 products could be produced through β scission of isopropyl group between two phenyl groups fig s19 wang et al 2020a the biological toxicities of degradation products were predicted by qsar analysis with ecosar program according to the united nations globally harmonized system all three compounds are in the category of very toxic table s3 on the whole majority of the intermediates generated by the co ii paa process endow lower toxicity compared to their parent compounds notably although the toxicity evolution tends to decrease most of the transformation by products are still classified as very toxic or toxic compounds to aquatic organisms besides co ii itself exerts potentially toxic to environment and public health as well kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020e in these regards vibrio fischeri was applied to evaluate the overall actual toxicity variation during the co ii paa process encouragingly toxicity of all three contaminants were moderate decreased during the co ii paa oxidation as evidenced by the improvement of the luminescence inhibition intensity fig 7 3 5 3 reactivity with inorganic anions and nom the elimination of organic pollutants in actual water bodies is usually suppressed by some background substances such as inorganic anions and natural organic matter to make clear of their reactivity with co iv cbz was used as targeted pollutant since it reacts readily with co iv but is inert to r o from fig 8 one can see that cl had no obvious impacts on the degradation of cbz even at 10 mm while hco3 significantly retard the degradation efficiency in general cl can consume radical species e g oh and r o to produce chloride radicals with weaker oxidative capacity thus exerting a more or less inhibition on the abatement of organic pollutants bojing et al 2019 the negligible influence means that co iv is insensitive to cl the negative effect of hco3 is likely because of their coordination with co ii wang et al 2020c 2020e which is not desired for co ii paa interaction this assumption is further supported by the result shown in fig s20 that the decay of paa was severely retarded in the presence of hco3 as a strong competitor ha induces a predictable retardance on cbz degradation fig 8c fortunately the cbz degradation still exhibited a high level 70 1 in 30 min when the concentration of ha reaches 10 mg l such promising environmental tolerance is superior to the radical based oxidation indicating the good feasible of co iv in practical application 4 conclusions for the first time this study unveils the overlooked role of co iv in the co ii paa process the finding is strongly supported by several lines of evidence including pmso based probe experiments 18o isotope labeling technique and in situ raman spectroscopy similar to fenton process it is found that the speciation of ros in the co ii paa process is also ph dependent as the increase of solution ph from acidic to neutral conditions the dominant ros are modified from co iv to r o ch3co2 and ch3co3 in addition the environmental tolerance of co iv is superior to the radical based oxidation revealing the excellent practical application potential of co iv based oxidative systems in wastewater treatment considering these ros exert different reactivity and aggressive behavior towards various substrates they may complement each other and make the co ii paa process more flexible in dealing with diverse environmental issues more importantly as a green disinfectant paa can provide a variety of organic carbon sources after activation rendering co ii paa process as an ideal candidate when combined with the biotreatment technologies however due to the limited information available on r o and co iv currently it is still a challenging subject to distinguish of the oxidative contributions of these ros in the co ii paa process in addition even though co ii paa process can detoxify some organic substrates the potential toxicity of co ii prevents its direct application in a homogeneous form thus further research is needed to investigated the catalytic performance and mechanism in cobalt based heterogeneous systems overall our findings deepen the fundamental understanding of co ii and paa reaction and will be useful for the application of co iv mediated processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16848,the combination of co ii and peracetic acid paa is a promising advanced oxidation process for the abatement of refractory organic contaminants and acetylperoxy ch3co3 and acetoxyl ch3co2 radicals are generally recognized as the dominant and selective intermediate oxidants however the role of high valent cobalt oxo species co iv have been overlooked herein we confirmed that co ii paa reaction enables the generation of co iv at acidic conditions based on multiple lines of evidences including methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso based probe experiments 18o isotope labeling technique and in situ raman spectroscopy in depth investigation reveals that the paa oxidation mechanism is strongly ph dependent the elevation of solution ph could induce major oxidants converting from co iv to oxygen centered radicals i e ch3co3 and ch3co2 the presence of h2o2 competitively consumes both co iv and reactive radicals generated from co ii paa process and thus leading to an undesirably decline in catalytic performance additionally as a highly reactive and selective oxidant co iv reacts readily with organic substances bearing electron rich groups and efficiently attenuating their biological toxicity our findings enrich the fundamental understanding of co ii and paa reaction and will be useful for the application of co iv mediated processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cobalt ii ion peracetic acid high valent cobalt oxo nonradical oxidation process 1 introduction peracetic acid paa is an organic peroxyacid that has been extensively applied in medical food and textile industries cai et al 2017 da silva et al 2020 kitis 2004 rokhina et al 2010 as a promising disinfectant it has also received increasing attention in the field of water and wastewater treatment owing to its easy retrofit high disinfection efficiency and negligible formation of harmful disinfection byproducts ao et al 2021 campo et al 2020 chen et al 2019 manoli et al 2019 rizzo et

peroxydisulfate reaction rather than the widely recognized sulfate radical wang et al 2018 recently this kind of mechanism has been further extended to some homologous fenton like reactions including fe ii pms wang et al 2019c 2020d fe ii hclo liang et al 2020 fe ii kio4 zong et al 2021 and fe ii paa kim et al 2019 systems inspired by these works zong et al took pmso as prob compound and re evaluated the ros in co ii pms process they strikingly found the yield of pmso2 was always close to 100 in the process at acidic conditions and the involvements of high valent cobalt oxo species co iv was thus strongly suggested zong et al 2020 this research is of great significance and breaks through the fundamental understanding of co ii pms reaction considering the similar nature of paa and pms we speculated that co ii could also activate paa via nonradical route to generate co iv as a matter of fact co iv species were widely studied and implicated as pivotal intermediates beyond the environmental field such as intermetal oxygen atom transfer alkane hydroxylation and olefin epoxidation reaction kanan et al 2009 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 comparably the potential application of co iv for wastewater remediation have been studied only limitedly moreover to the best of our knowledge the engagement of co iv species in the co iv paa system has never been discoursed and is still ambiguous in this work for the first time we corroborated the paa simulated two electron conversion of co ii to co iv rather than radicals generation under acidic conditions several strategies were integrated to identify the occurrence of co iv including pmso based probe 18o labeled experiments and in situ raman spectra then the reactivity of co iv towards several representative pollutants e g sulfamethoxazole smx bisphenol a bpa and carbamazepine cbz was evaluated in view of the widespread concern of their teratogenicity carcinogenicity and bio recalcitranty nature in addition the relative degradation products of target compounds were identified and their toxicity was predicted via qsar analysis based on the identified products also the effect of solution chemistry dosages of paa co ii and h2o2 and solution ph on co iv generation and nontarget matrix constituents anions and nature organic matters on contaminant degradation were considered 2 materials and methods 2 1

degradation of pmso in the co ii paa system at ph0 3 5 the concentration of pmso remained essentially constant after the addition of either co ii or paa indicating co ii and paa alone were not effective fig s1 in contrast significant removal of pmso was observed within 30 min of co ii paa oxidation meanwhile it is very interesting that nearly equal molar amount of pmso2 was formed a special indicative product converted from pmso the yield of pmso2 i e η pmso2 represents the conversion ratio of pmso to pmso2 was quantified 100 this result evidenced that ros capable of converting pmso to pmso2 were generated during co ii paa oxidation moreover it should be noted that the used paa solutions contain co existing h2o2 in this work and the molar ratio of paa h2o2 is 1 24 thus the h2o2 background concentration was 81 μm when the paa concentration was 100 μm to evaluate the role of h2o2 the conversion of pmso was monitored in the coexistence of co ii and h2o2 under comparable conditions as depicted in fig s2 pmso was not degraded even under the much higher concentration of total peroxides i e 1 mm h2o2 indicating minor contribution of the co existing h2o2 to the transformation of pmso in co ii paa process the insignificant reaction of h2o2 and co ii is in good accordance with literature reports that co ii ion is an ineffective catalyst for h2o2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 ling et al 2010 this discrepancy can be ascribed to the higher peroxide oo bond energy as mentioned above and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy of h2o2 kim et al 2019 in fact co ii could be a potentially effective activator for h2o2 only when the coordination involves suitable ligands chen et al 2012 thus it can be deduced that the conversion of pmso was stem from the activation of paa by co ii 3 2 identification of working oxidants for pmso conversion 3 2 1 probing oh oh is a common species for the degradation of contaminants in metal catalytic aops to identify the occurrence of oh in co ii paa system dmpo trapped epr spectroscopies were conducted one can observe that no signal was detected for co ii and paa alone comparatively a legible signal of dmpo oh adduct with αn αh 14 9 g appeared in the co ii paa system fig 2 a this signal is generally corresponded to a signature for the presence of oh nonetheless it is reported that the unique reaction between high valence metal e g fe iv wang et al 2018 cu iii wang et al 2020c mn vii xu et al 2017 and co iv liu et al 2021 zong et al 2020 and water could also led to the generation of dmpo oh adducts via the forrester hepburn mechanism jing and chaplin 2017 sugden and wetterhahn 1996 in other words the detection of dmpo oh adducts is not formed solely from oh to make it clear tba was involved as the oh quenching agents k oh tba 3 8 to 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 liu et al 2020b wang et al 2019b as depicted in fig 2b the signal intensity of dmpo oh only slight suppression upon the addition of excessive tba this phenomenon was in stark contrast to the fenton process a oh benchmark system where the presence of tba induced the dmpo oh signal to be strongly diminished consequently the generation dmpooh adduct in co ii paa process should not be ascribed to oh but to other interpretation presumably due to the nucleophilic addition of water in the presence of co iv or inverted spin trapping this conclusion was also supported by the result of classical scavenging experiments as shown in fig s3 tba fail to produce an obvious inhibition on pmso degradation confirming the contribution of oh is negligible more importantly previous studies indicated that the pmso is vulnerable towards oh attack and can only convert pmso to hydroxylating products rather than pmso2 dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018 which was also inconsistent with the above obtained result fig 1 collectively it can be conclude that oh played minor role in pmso conversion during the co ii paa oxidation 3 2 2 probing singlet oxygen 1o2 in some paa based catalytic systems 1o2 was generally considered as a potential ros which endows the ability to oxidize sulfoxides to sulfones edwards et al 1979 temp is reported to be a special spin trapping agent for the discrimination of 1o2 as shown in fig 2c a typical triplet signal of temp 1o2 with equal intensities was detected in paa solution evidencing the presence of 1o2 this result was consistent with previous findings that paa could self decompose and release a certain amount of 1o2 evans and upton 1985 however it was very interesting the intensity of these triplet signals appeared in co ii paa process were comparable to that generated in paa alone indicating that the generation of 1o2 was independent upon the introduction of co ii given there was no obvious degradation of pmso in paa alone 1o2 plays a negligible role in converting pmso to pmso2 during co ii paa oxidation fig s1 this conclusion was further supported by the solvent exchange h2o to d2o results given the lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 22 70 μs was more than 10 fold longer than that in h2o 2 9 4 6 μs gorman and rodgers 1981 yang et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 which should kinetically accelerate the oxidation in 1o2 involved process however the pmso degradation and pmso2 generation by co ii paa was barely impacted in absolute d2o fig s4 revealing that 1o2 was not responsible for pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in co ii paa process 3 2 3 contribution of oxygen centered radicals r o it has been recognized that reactive oxygen centered radicals r o such as ch3co2 and ch3co3 were formed during the co ii paa oxidation at neutral condition and perform well in selectively removing various organic contaminants kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020e to examine whether r o contributes to the destruction of pmso under acidic conditions the degradation of pmso was conducted in uv paa process photolysis of paa solutions at 254 nm was used to generation r o and the formed oh was quenched by adding excess tba as shown in fig 2d the comparison between uv alone and uv tba exhibited that the pmso degradation under uv alone was hardly suppressed after adding tba suggesting the modest abatement of pmso under uv irradiation was primarily attributed to direct photolysis comparison between uv paa with or without tba showed that tba introduction only slight inhibited pmso degradation by uv paa evidencing that r o generated from the uv paa process were dominant radicals contributed to pmso destruction instead of oh nevertheless no pmso2 production was observed during uv paa process the results appeared to suggest that r o was reactive to pmso but cannot oxidize pmso to pmso2 to gain more credible evidence the transformation products of pmso of uv paa process were investigated using hplc qtof ms according to the condensed dual descriptor the most negative positions of pmso pmso2 were located at para carbon of benzene ring suggesting that they are the most favorable sites for the electrophilic attack thus the oxidation products of pmso and pmso2 by r o are proposed as para compounds table s2 and fig s6 as listed in table s2 besides the hydroxylated products presumably due to either the direct photolysis or hydrogen atom abstraction by peroxyl radicals three extra products p 183 c8h8o3s p 185 c8h10o3s and p 197 c9h10o3s were detected in extracted ion chromatogram eic at retention time of 2 50 3 22 and 3 99 min respectively however no signal of psmo2 was detected in the process it should be carefully noted that the absence of pmso2 could be attributed two distinct reasons i the reaction between r o and pmso does not produce pmso2 and ii the generated pmso2 is rapidly oxidized to intermediates by r o which was supported by the moderate degradation of pmso2 in uv paa process fig s5 to further make it clear the oxidation products of pmso2 were also identified table s1 as could be seen besides pmso2 three additional products p 156 c6h6o3s p 171 c7h8o3s and p 201 c9h10o4s were observed comparatively these products were not detected in the case of pmso during uv paa process fig s7 these results essentially rule out the involvement of r o in oxidizing pmso to pmso2 moreover considering the η pmso2 values remained steady at approximately 100 r o marginally contributed to the degradation of pmso at given experimental condition 3 2 4 evidence of co iv generation in co ii paa process other than the aforementioned oxidants it was reported that co ii or co ii complexes can react with peroxides e g pms and h2o2 via two electron transfer to produce co iv initiating a nonradical oxidation of organics similar to other high valent metal oxo species barats damatov et al 2014 dong et al 2020b li et al 2018a wang et al 2018 zong et al 2020 the water soluble sulfoxides could be quantitatively converted to corresponding sulfones through the oxygen atom transfer mechanism this signature behavior is agreed well with the observation of the pmso conversion during co ii paa oxidation therefore we hypothesize that co iv could be the working oxidant in the co ii paa process to verify this hypothesis some solid evidence should be provided co iv is highly unstable and challenging to trap and characterize it was reported that the intermetal coo bond could undergo oxygen atom exchange reaction with solvent water hohenberger et al 2012 pestovsky et al 2005 wang et al 2019c thus if co iv was the main working oxidant for pmso conversion during co ii paa oxidation 18o isotope labeling product ought to detected when the reaction system was carried over into h18o matrix as expected upon introduction of h2 18o the extracted ion chromatogram eic exhibits two prominent peaks for m z 155 0172 and m z 157 0216 with the same retention time fig 3 a the mass and isotope distribution patterns of m z 155 0172 corresponds to pms16o16o calcd m z 155 0172 the presence of two mass unit shift of m z 157 0216 corresponds to pms18o16o calcd m z 157 0213 indicating the successful incorporation of the 18o into the pmso2 meanwhile the characteristic fragments of pms16o16o also showed the m z value shift of two mass units fig 3b besides the control experiment with pms16o16o alone in h2 18o revealed no production of pms16o18o excluding the possible oxygen atom exchange between pms16o16o and h2 18o fig s8 hence the formation of 18o isotope labeling pmso2 provided a conclusive evidence for the generation of co iv in the co ii paa process additional credible evidence was discovered by in situ raman spectra fresh co ii alone show three spectral features were visible at 451 622 and 1110 cm 1 when co ii interacted with paa several fresh vibration bands appeared fig 3e the most notable feature is the appearance of the strong isotope sensitive peaks at 394 and 810 cm 1 when h2 18o was used the difference feature at 394 426 cm 1 can reasonable be assigned to diatomic coo oscillator hohenberger et al 2012 a signature of terminal coo bond fig 3c since observed isotopic shift of its 16δ 18δ value 32 cm 1 is closed to calculated value of δv 34 cm 1 similar red shift was also observed in oxygen evolution reaction on cobalt oxyhydroxide moysiadou et al 2020 suggesting the presence of co iv species in addition the vibrational frequency at 810 cm 1 could be ascribed to the oo harmonic oscillator stem from the formation of co ii paa complex fig 3d the position of the band is comparable to that of side on cobalt peroxo complexes such as co iii 12 tmc o2 and co iii 13 tmc o2 shin et al 2016 cho et al 2010 the result further lend strong credence to the intermediacy of co iv during co ii paa oxidation 3 3 influencing factors 3 3 1 effects of paa and co ii dosages to gain more information about the generation of co iv in the co ii paa process the effects of co ii dosages on the conversion of pmso 100 μm by the co ii paa process were examined at ph0 3 5 while fixing paa 0 at 500 μm as shown the rate for pmso degradation was increased with increasing co ii dosage from 10 to 200 μm and a kinetic plateau was reached as co ii 0 was further increased 500 μm fig 4 a correspondingly the production of pmso2 followed the same trend varying from 10 to 500 μm fig s9 such saturation kinetics associated with co ii dosage were in stark contrast to the fe iv based process which the competitive depletion of fe iv by fe ii was relatively noteworthy jacobsen et al 1998 pestovsky and bakac 2004 conversely the distinct behavior in the co ii paa process implies that the side reaction between co iv and co ii was rather limited the effect of paa dosages was investigated while co ii 0 was fixed at 100 μm pmso removal rate increased from 0 03 to 0 19 min 1 when paa concentration was increased for 0 10 to 1 0 mm however it was observed that further increasing paa 0 to 10 0 mm triggered dramatically inhibition of pmso degradation and pmso2 production fig 4b and fig s9 these results indicated that the competitive depletion of co iv by paa or h2o2 was much stronger than that by co ii 3 3 2 effect of h2o2 considering the coexistence of h2o2 in the paa solution the extra h2o2 was added into co ii paa solution to investigate the impacts of h2o2 in the conversion of pmso by co ii paa oxidation the possible reactions between paa and h2o2 at the given experiment conditions was excluded since the decay of paa only varied insignificantly with the initial h2o2 concentration fig s10 fig s11 shows that the addition of extra h2o2 1 0 mm at an initial paa dos of 500 μm led to the completely inhibition of pmso degradation the result implies that the increased concentration of h2o2 didn t responsible for the enhancement of overall pmso conversion with the elevation of paa dose on the other hand the decrease in pmso oxidation efficiency by additionally h2o2 suggested the possible scavenging of co iv by h2o2 to further ascertain whether h2o2 competitively consumes of co iv the effects of additionally h2o2 on pmso conversion was monitored using co ii pms as reference system as co iv has been proved as the major oxidant during co ii pms oxidation under acidic conditions liu et al 2021 zong et al 2020 it can be seen from fig s12 the degradation of pmso was evidently blocked by h2o2 clearly evidencing the significant consumption of co iv by h2o2 in addition the introduction of horseradish peroxidase in the co ii paa process with high paa concentration induced considerable promotion on pmso oxidation efficiency fig s13 suggesting the competitive depletion of co iv by h2o2 should exceed than that of paa eqs 1 and 2 1 c h 3 c o ooh 2 c o iv o 2 c h 3 c o o 2 c o 3 o h o 2 2 h 2 o 2 2 c o iv o 2 h o 2 2 c o 3 o h strikingly it was also noticed that the calculated η pmso2 gradually decreased from 95 8 to 51 9 with increasing paa dosage from 0 5 mm to 10 0 mm fig s19 the result means that co iv was not the sole oxidants account for pmso degradation at high paa concentration and the contributions of r o should be considered as reported previously the thermodynamically favorable reactions between h2o2 and r o leads to the generation ho2 eqs 3 and 4 kim et al 2020 2019 wang et al 2020e when generated ho2 o2 can scavenge ch3co3 at relatively high kinetic efficiency and thus resulting in slowing down pmso degradation eq 5 in this regard the increase of paa dose can not only accelerate the generation of ros i e co iv and r o but also strength the consumption of ros the decline in η pmso2 with the increase of paa was consistent with the foregoing inference that the reaction between co iv and h2o2 is more significant than that paa in addition given the degradation of pmso shows negative relationship under high paa dose which suggests that the scavenging effect of higher h2o2 concentration exceeds the improvement of generated ros via the elevation of paa concentration in the current system 3 c h 3 c o 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o 2 h h o 2 4 c h 3 c o 3 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o 3 h h o 2 5 c h 3 c o 3 h o 2 c h 3 c o 3 h o 2 3 3 3 effect of solution ph subsequently in order to disclose the major ros generated in the co paa system under vary ph exceeding 3 5 the transformation of pmso were estimated over the ph range from 4 0 8 0 as shown in fig 4c the abatement of pmso and formation of pmso2 decreased progressively as the ph values rose up specifically the removal of pmso dropped drastically from maximum 88 7 μm at ph 3 5 to 19 9 μm at ph 6 correspondingly the production of pmso2 were dropped from 85 9 μm at ph 3 5 to 18 1 μm at ph 6 0 nevertheless the calculated η pmso2 was always close to 100 at ph 3 5 6 0 indicating the dominant role of co iv in the co ii paa system under acidic conditions in contrast under neutral conditions the loss of pmso and production of pmso2 was unremarkable considering the direct reaction between pmso and paa could also induce insignificant generation of pmso2 fig s1 which make it hard to distinguish the role of co iv or paa at low pmso concentration nonetheless when a higher initial concentration of pmso 2 mm was used in the co ii paa process the production of pmso2 was always over those in controls without co ii fig s14 this result evidences that co iv was implicated in the co ii paa process at circumneutral conditions noteworthy it has been proved that r o are the dominant oxidants under neutral conditions while exert negligible role under acidic conditions in the co ii paa process therefore it is inferred that ph might induced a mechanistic changeover from one to two electron transfer to substantiate this cbz and smx degradation experiments were conducted as reported previously cbz readily reacts with co iv but it is resistant to oxidation by r o while smx is susceptible to oxidation by both co iv and r o cai et al 2017 rayaroth et al 2019 wang et al 2020b from fig s15 one can observe that the decay ratio of cbz was suppressed from 84 5 to 1 2 as the increase of ph from 3 5 to 7 0 indicating that the generation of co iv was narrowed with solution ph in contrast the abatement of smx was obviously accelerated with the elevation of solution ph fig s15 the promoted degradation efficiency is likely because of the relatively higher reaction rate of smx with r o than that of co iv wang et al 2020e further the presence of excess dmso discernibly restrained cbz and smx removal at acidic condition while produced no obvious inhibition under neutral medium these observations were consistent with the deduction that the primary intermediate oxidants from co ii paa process were converted from co iv to r o with the elevation of solution ph this ph dependent oxidation behavior may be related to the alteration in paa speciation considering the pk a of paa is 8 2 neutral and alkaline conditions could make a favorable platform to produce dissociated species of paa paa the oo bond length of the paa ch3c o oo molecules is estimated to be 1 454 å which is longer that of neutral species of paa0 1 444 å fig s16 thus the paa0 is more difficult to break the oo bond and generate free radicals this conclusion can be further supported by the energy gap between lumo and highest occupied molecular orbital homo analysis as shown the lumo homo gap of paa0 7 54 ev is much higher than that of paa 4 88 ev implying that one electron transfer from co ii to paa is easier than that to paa0 because of the low energy barrier fig 4d this is also consistent with the fact that paa is a stronger reductant than paa0 alternatively the potential reaction pathways involve proton transfer along with the subsequent oo bond cleavage may be more thermodynamically favorable in the case of paa0 as analogous to co ii pms process zong et al 2020 3 4 proposed mechanism on the basis of the above results and discussion the possible mechanism for the generation of ros in co ii paa system is inferred analogy to fe ii h2o2 and co ii pms system bataineh et al 2012 zong et al 2020 the co ii first coordinates with paa by an inner sphere water exchange mechanism resulting in the generation of co ii paa complex under acidic conditions the formed transient complex prone to dissociate through a two electron transfer producing co iv eqs 6 and 7 at neutral conditions the peroxo oo bond cleavage switches from heterolytic to homolytic and thus leading to the main ros switch from co iv to various r o the one electron transfer pathway of co ii paa activation process is fairly well understood in literatures and the kinetic model are postulated as following eq 8 and 9 kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020e 6 co ii c h 3 c o ooh co ii c h 3 c o ooh complex 7 co ii c h 3 c o ooh complex co iv c h 3 c o o h 8 co ii c h 3 c o ooh co iii c h 3 c o o o h 9 co iii c h 3 c o ooh co ii c h 3 c o o o h 3 5 reactivity of co iv 3 5 1 degradation of various contaminants in co ii paa system the reactivity of co iv towards typical environmental micropollutants was also evaluated under the condition of paa 0 100 μm organics 0 10 μm and co ii 0 10 μm 0 59 mg l 1 less than the permissible limit of 1 mg l 1 based on the chinese national standard gb 25 467 2010 li et al 2018b from fig 5 a no obvious degradation of benzoic acid ba was observed and 20 atrazine atz and ibuprofen ibp were abated with 30 min cbz was moderately degraded with the decay ratio of 84 5 at 30 min in contrast under identical conditions a complete elimination of bisphenol a bpa and smx were realized within 15 min and 20 min respectively paa and co ii alone caused negligible influence on the degradation of these organic contaminants the above results suggest that co iv could oxidize various organic contaminants with varying efficiencies similar selective catalytic degradation of pollutants was also occurred in several nonradical systems in previous studies bokare and choi 2015 hu et al 2017 yun et al 2017 to disclose substrate specificity of co iv relationships of ionization potential ip values with respect to degradation rate constants of organics were evaluated generally electron rich groups e g amido and hydroxyl can lower ip of the compounds whereas electron withdrawn groups e g nitryl and carboxyl exert an adverse trend as shown in fig 5b it was found that there may be an ip threshold at 6 0 ev assigning to the oxidative ability of co iv to react with pollutants ba atz and ibp with higher ip values than threshold were barely oxidized in co ii paa process since the relatively weak redox potential of co iv in contrast the contaminants with a low ip values were vulnerable to be oxidized with high reactivity such selective catalytic oxidation dependent upon ip values have also been reported for ozone 1o2 and fe iv li et al 2013b ye et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 3 5 2 products evaluation and toxicity prediction the transformation products of representative contaminants i e smx cbz and bpa were determined to further clarify the interaction between contaminants and co iv fig 6 and table s3 it was reported that the oxidation patterns of high valent metal oxo moieties including electron transfer hydrogen abstraction and oxygen atom transfer which is highly specific to the structures of substances blakemore et al 2015 engelmann et al 2016 for all three compounds hydroxylation and or oxygenation intermediates were produced i e m z of 268 0391 300 0285 224 0705 269 0911 243 1027 for smx cbz and bpa respectively these hydroxylated products could be generated from the electron transfer reaction by co iv additional products of smx included m z of 258 0385 282 0914 and 172 0055 are proposed to be oxidated via an oxygen atom transfer route the 99 0557 and 172 0055 products could be related to the cleavage of ns bond which subsequently led to the generation of hydroxylation products notably the n radical coupling products were regarded as the oxidation products of smx induced by r o wang et al 2020b 2020e yet these products were not detected in this work further demonstrating the negligible contribution from r o in the co ii paa process under acidic conditions fig s17 for cbz the epoxidation derivative m z of 253 0973 was first formed and the epoxide ring was further split to generate the ring contracted intermediate m z of 271 1073 through the pinacol type rearrangement li et al 2013a additional products of 210 0915 and 198 0754 could be formed by hydroxylation from heterocyclic ring with the lose an acylamino and a keto group respectively fig s18 besides bpa also underwent demethylation to form hydroperoxyl product i e m z of 245 0816 the 151 0762 and 149 0608 products could be produced through β scission of isopropyl group between two phenyl groups fig s19 wang et al 2020a the biological toxicities of degradation products were predicted by qsar analysis with ecosar program according to the united nations globally harmonized system all three compounds are in the category of very toxic table s3 on the whole majority of the intermediates generated by the co ii paa process endow lower toxicity compared to their parent compounds notably although the toxicity evolution tends to decrease most of the transformation by products are still classified as very toxic or toxic compounds to aquatic organisms besides co ii itself exerts potentially toxic to environment and public health as well kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020e in these regards vibrio fischeri was applied to evaluate the overall actual toxicity variation during the co ii paa process encouragingly toxicity of all three contaminants were moderate decreased during the co ii paa oxidation as evidenced by the improvement of the luminescence inhibition intensity fig 7 3 5 3 reactivity with inorganic anions and nom the elimination of organic pollutants in actual water bodies is usually suppressed by some background substances such as inorganic anions and natural organic matter to make clear of their reactivity with co iv cbz was used as targeted pollutant since it reacts readily with co iv but is inert to r o from fig 8 one can see that cl had no obvious impacts on the degradation of cbz even at 10 mm while hco3 significantly retard the degradation efficiency in general cl can consume radical species e g oh and r o to produce chloride radicals with weaker oxidative capacity thus exerting a more or less inhibition on the abatement of organic pollutants bojing et al 2019 the negligible influence means that co iv is insensitive to cl the negative effect of hco3 is likely because of their coordination with co ii wang et al 2020c 2020e which is not desired for co ii paa interaction this assumption is further supported by the result shown in fig s20 that the decay of paa was severely retarded in the presence of hco3 as a strong competitor ha induces a predictable retardance on cbz degradation fig 8c fortunately the cbz degradation still exhibited a high level 70 1 in 30 min when the concentration of ha reaches 10 mg l such promising environmental tolerance is superior to the radical based oxidation indicating the good feasible of co iv in practical application 4 conclusions for the first time this study unveils the overlooked role of co iv in the co ii paa process the finding is strongly supported by several lines of evidence including pmso based probe experiments 18o isotope labeling technique and in situ raman spectroscopy similar to fenton process it is found that the speciation of ros in the co ii paa process is also ph dependent as the increase of solution ph from acidic to neutral conditions the dominant ros are modified from co iv to r o ch3co2 and ch3co3 in addition the environmental tolerance of co iv is superior to the radical based oxidation revealing the excellent practical application potential of co iv based oxidative systems in wastewater treatment considering these ros exert different reactivity and aggressive behavior towards various substrates they may complement each other and make the co ii paa process more flexible in dealing with diverse environmental issues more importantly as a green disinfectant paa can provide a variety of organic carbon sources after activation rendering co ii paa process as an ideal candidate when combined with the biotreatment technologies however due to the limited information available on r o and co iv currently it is still a challenging subject to distinguish of the oxidative contributions of these ros in the co ii paa process in addition even though co ii paa process can detoxify some organic substrates the potential toxicity of co ii prevents its direct application in a homogeneous form thus further research is needed to investigated the catalytic performance and mechanism in cobalt based heterogeneous systems overall our findings deepen the fundamental understanding of co ii and paa reaction and will be useful for the application of co iv mediated processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

16849,the first order model is the most widely utilized model for chlorine decay due to its having only one parameter and an analytical solution while variable reaction coefficient type models have higher accuracy and wider application range their widespread uses are hindered by their complexity and the non existence of an analytical solution the objective of this study was to develop a variable parabolic reaction coefficient model to simulate and predict chlorine decay in bulk water the decreasing reactivity of the reacting agents is included in a variable coefficient which decreases with increasing consumption of the chlorine reactive species concentration the model includes minimal parameters that must be calculated and an analytical solution was derived experimental data including chlorination with different initial chlorine concentrations or temperatures rechlorination and water mixing were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of the variable parabolic reaction coefficient model under different conditions the relationship between the parameters and temperature was established utilizing the arrhenius equation on the basis of assumptions that the chlorine consumed by reactions with the pipe wall does not decrease the variable rate coefficient this study subtracted the instantaneous aggregate chlorine wall consumption from the total chlorine consumption so that the parameter values in the vprc model derived from laboratory decay tests can be used in the system model for output water at the entrance of the wdn with unknown initial chlorine concentration and unknown decay duration from disinfection to entry into the water distribution network an effective method to determine the model parameter is proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine variable parabolic reaction coefficient analytical solution water distribution network 1 introduction disinfection as a barrier against the pathogenic microorganism in the water distribution system is a crucial process in water treatment poleneni 2020 chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant in the world due to its simplicity low cost and effectiveness etc jonkergouw et al 2009 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 however there are increasing concerns about the safety of chlorine disinfection chlorine reacting with natural organic matter nom in drinking water leads to by products that are known to be harmful to human health such as trihalomethane thm and haloacetic acids haas nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 richardson et al 2007 minimizing the amount of chlorine dose is a practical way to limit dbps formation but a chlorine residual is required to prevent re pollution and bacterial regrowth lechevallier 1999 therefore rechlorination at intermediate locations is usually utilized to enable the initial chlorine dose to be lowered and ensure a chlorine residual at network endings who 2004 generally the overall chlorine decay within a water distribution network wdn includes bulk and wall decay wang et al 2019 bulk decay refers to chlorine loss caused by its reaction with substances in the bulk water while wall decay is caused by the reaction of chlorine with the pipe wall and substances adhering to it such as biofilm and corrosion fisher et al 2011 stated that an accurate chlorine decay model for bulk water must be established before characterizing the pipe wall chlorine decay over the past several decades many models have been proposed to predict bulk chlorine decay the first order model proposed by johnson 1978 the most widely utilized in wdn software is presented in eq 1 as follows 1 d c t d t k c t where c0 is the initial chlorine concentration icc mg l ct is the chlorine concentration at time t mg l t is time h and k is the rate coefficient h 1 the analytical solution of eq 1 is as follows 2 c t c 0 e k t the first order model is simple and feasible because only a single parameter k is required to be determined and it has an analytical solution however it has not produced accurate data fitting in many applications clark 1998 kastl et al 1999 kohpaei and sathasivan 2011 additionally fisher et al 2011 determined that the representation of slower decay which occurs after rechlorination is difficult unless the model updates the rate coefficient value haas and karra 1984 proposed limited first parallel first and nth order models these models and the first order model assume that the chlorine reactive species concentration is significantly greater than the chlorine concentration therefore first order kinetics will not yield accurate results for drinking water contradicting this assumption to compensate for the first order kinetics deficiencies clark 1998 proposed a second order chlorine decay model and rossman 2000 provided a means to implement this decay model from time zero utilizing epanet software boccelli et al 2003 simplified the form of the second order model and proposed a method to update the model coefficients after rechlorination actually chlorine bulk decay is caused by a series of concurrent reactions with a multitude of chlorine reactive species jonkergouw et al 2009 the second order bilinear multiple reactant model is as follows 3 d c t d t c t i 1 n k i x i t where ct is the chlorine concentration at time t mg l xi t is the ith chlorine reactive species concentration at time t mg l and ki is the rate coefficient of the reaction between chlorine and the ith chlorine reactive species kastl et al 1999 simplified the second order bilinear multiple reactant model by dividing reactants into two constituents fast and slow reducing agents and proposed the following parallel second order model 4 d c t d t k f c t x f k s c t x s where ct is the chlorine concentration at time t mg l and xf and xs are the fast and slow reducing agent concentrations mg l respectively additionally kf and ks denote the rate coefficients of the fast and slow reactions h 1 respectively an alternative model which may have similar accuracy and efficiency is the variable reaction rate vrc model pioneered by jonkergouw et al 2009 in the vrc model jonkergouw et al 2009 defined a concentration weighted rate coefficient calculated by an empirical equation the parameter values of the vrc model are identical before and after rechlorination however the efficiency and complexity of the model are questioned due to its larger number of parameters shortly afterward on the basis of the vrc model hua et al 2015 proposed a variable reaction rate coefficient vrrc model which reduced the number of parameters and number of differential equations to three and one respectively however widespread uses of some models including the vrrc model are hindered by their complexity most importantly the non existence of an analytical solution jabari et al 2011 moreover the vrrc model requires a relatively accurate initial chlorine concentration value to reflect the ratio of chlorine consumption to the maximum chlorine demand thus obtaining an accurate initial chlorine concentration is the premise of prediction for rechlorine and water mixing in fact this value is difficult to obtain for output water at the entrance of the wdn due to the dynamic changes in chlorine dosage for disinfection and residence time from disinfection to entry into the wdn fisher et al 2011 determined that a suitable bulk chlorine decay model should meet the following five criteria 1 it accurately predicts chlorine concentration over an extended period 2 it is simple due to the requirement of minimal parameters 3 it utilizes actual icc rather than a calibration value 4 it utilizes identical parameter values before and after rechlorination and 5 the parameter values are identical for all iccs the first order model meets criteria 2 but it does not satisfy criteria 3 5 maybe meeting criteria 2 might be the key to applying the model in epanet the second order bilinear multiple reactant model may be the only appropriate way to satisfy criterion 4 however the multiple reactant theory based vrc model does not meet criterion 2 notably neither the concentration weighted rate coefficient nor the product of the variable rate coefficient and total reacting substance concentration k i x i t x i t and k i x i t respectively are related to the chlorine reactive species concentration whose loss is caused by bulk chlorine decay therefore chlorine loss attributed to the pipe wall is assumed not to decrease the coefficient value which must be included in any vrc type bulk chlorine decay model however previous vrc type chlorine bulk decay models do not consider this the purposes of this study are to 1 develop a simple second order bilinear multiple reactant model with a variable rate coefficient that reflects the decline in reactant reactivity via an empirical function with minimal parameters 2 derive the analytical solution of differential equation in the model 3 establish a relationship between the model parameters and temperatures utilizing the arrhenius equation 4 propose a model that makes the variable rate coefficient values independent of the chlorine loss caused by pipe wall reaction 5 compare the accuracies of the variable parabolic reaction coefficient vprc and first order models and 6 show the applicability of the model for simulating chlorine bulk decay including rechlorination and water mixing 2 model development 2 1 vprc model derivation chlorine bulk decay is caused by concurrent reactions with various chlorine reactive species in bulk water such as dissolved molecules ions insoluble solids and biotic and abiotic components gallard and von gunten 2002 warton et al 2006 jonkergouw et al 2009 expressed one of the reactions between chlorine and the ith chlorine reactive species as follows 5 c l x i k i p i where cl represents the chlorine component xi denotes the ith chlorine reactive species i 1 2 n and ki and pi denote the rate constant of the reaction and its disinfection byproduct respectively if the reaction with a single chlorine reactive species is first order the decay rate of xi can be described as follows 6 d x i t d t k i c t x i t where ct is the chlorine concentration at time t mg l xi t is the concentration of the ith chlorine reactive species at time t mg l and ki is the reaction rate coefficient for the ith chlorine reactive species by assuming the bulk chlorine decay is caused by n parallel reactions jonkergouw et al 2009 expressed the chlorine decay rate as follows 7 d c t d t i 1 n d x i t d t c t i 1 n k i x i t however accurate determinations of the reaction rate coefficient and the concentration of each chlorine reactive species are difficult therefore a new variable rate coefficient kt calculated as the sum of the product of the reaction rate coefficient ki and the chlorine reactive species concentration xi was utilized as follows 8 k t i 1 n k i x t i according to eq 8 kt is determined by the concentration of each chlorine reactive species and its reaction rate coefficient which is affected by temperature therefore kt does not abruptly change before and after rechlorination theoretically no relationship exists between k0 and the icc therefore to explore their characteristics eq 8 can be differentiated utilizing eq 6 as follows 9 d k t d t c t i 1 n k i 2 x t i eq 9 demonstrates that the rate of change in kt throughout the reaction is 1 negative i e kt decreases over time 2 related to the temperature that affects ki i e kt decreases faster at higher temperatures 3 positively correlated with the chlorine and chlorine reactive species concentrations and 4 decreases to nearly zero when the chlorine is nearly consumed the characteristics of kt obtained from eqs 8 and 9 are the criteria for establishing a new empirical equation to calculate kt however the direct determination of the relationship between kt and the chlorine concentration consumption is not appropriate in real wdns rechlorination and the pipe wall reaction change the chlorine concentration however based on eq 8 they do not change kt thus chlorine reactive consumption is introduced and kt is described as the following inverse proportional equation 10 k t k 0 1 α δ x t x m a x 2 where k0 is the initial kt h 1 δxt is the chlorine reactive species concentration consumption at time t mg l xmax is the chlorine reactive species concentration in the filtered water mg l and α is the model dimensionless parameter differentiation of eq 10 provides 11 d k t d t d k 0 1 α δ x t x m a x 2 d t 2 α k 0 k t c t x m a x 1 α δ x t x m a x 3 when kt is described by this empirical equation the characteristics of the rate of change in kt are the same as those of the variable rate coefficient in eq 9 in the absence of rechlorination or water mixing δ x t x max is related to the chlorine concentration as shown in eq 12 12 δ x t x m a x δ c t c m a x c 0 c t c m a x where δct is is the chlorine concentration consumption at time t cmax is the maximum chlorine demand mg l α and cmax are undetermined parameters in this study thus a new parameter u is utilized to describe them as follows 13 u α c m a x eq 10 can be rewritten utilizing eqs 12 and 13 as follows 14 k t k 0 1 u c 0 c t 2 and substituting eqs 8 and 14 into eq 7 produces the following 15 d c t d t k 0 1 u c 0 c t 2 c t which can be rearranged to the following 16 1 u c 0 2 c t d c t 2 u 1 u c 0 d c t u 2 c t d c t k 0 d t the solution of differential equations is derived from eq 16 as follows 17 1 u c 0 2 l n c t 2 u 1 u c 0 c t u 2 2 c t 2 k 0 t a the value of parameter a is obtained when t 0 via eq 17 as follows 18 a 1 u c 0 2 l n c 0 2 u 1 u c 0 c 0 u 2 2 c 0 2 substituting eq 18 into eq 17 results in 19 1 u c 0 2 l n c 0 c t 2 u 1 u c 0 c 0 c t u 2 2 c 0 2 c t 2 k 0 t which can be rearranged as 20 t 1 u c 0 2 k 0 l n c 0 c t u 2 k 0 c 0 c t 4 3 u c 0 u c t the final vprc model is as follows d c t d t k 0 1 u c 0 c t 2 c t or 21 t 1 u c 0 2 k 0 l n c 0 c t u 2 k 0 c 0 c t 4 3 u c 0 u c t 2 2 model application for chlorine decay at different scenarios temperature is an important factor affecting the chlorine decay rate and seasonal water temperatures should be considered to plan and manage real wdns successfully thus it is necessary to explore the relationships between the model parameters and temperature the inclusion of temperature variation in the model was performed via the fisher et al 2012 method which utilized the following classical arrhenius equation 22 l n k 0 e a r t c where t is the absolute temperature k k0 is the initial variable rate coefficient of the vprc model ea is the experimental activation energy j mol and r is the molar gas constant j mol k for ea r if the initial variable rate coefficient k1 0 at temperature t1 is known another initial variable rate coefficient k2 0 at temperature t2 can be calculated as follows 23 k 2 0 k 1 0 e x p e a t 1 t 2 r t 1 t 2 to determine the ea r value in this study a linear graph of lnk0 versus 1 t was drawn to obtain the slope ea r based on the chlorination at different temperatures in long distance wdns rechlorination at various locations throughout the network effectively ensures the residual chlorine concentration at the network endings and reduces disinfection by products updating the k0 parameter and variable rate coefficient kt is not required after rechlorination because according to eq 8 they only depend on temperature and chlorine reactive species concentration for the same reason δxt does not abruptly change before and after rechlorination therefore its expression would change to the following 24 δ x t x m a x c 0 c t c r c m a x where cr is the chlorine concentration increase caused by rechlorination mg l substituting eq 24 into eq 10 the vprc model for residual chlorine simulation including rechlorination is as follows 25 d c t d t k 0 1 u c 0 c r c t 2 c t notably there are many wdns in which more than one rechlorination is required when the water flows through n rechlorination locations the expression of cr is given as 26 c r i 1 n c r i where cr i is the chlorine concentration increase at the point of the ith rechlorination mg l for output water that has not reached any rechlorination locations the value of cr is zero meanwhile the chlorine concentration ct will increase abruptly and the increment is cr i when water flows through the ith secondary chlorination site thus ct has the following expression before and after rechlorination 27 c t i c t i c r i where c t i and c t i are the chlorine concentrations immediately before and after rechlorination respectively during the simulation cr i is equivalent to a tracker to determine whether the water passes the ith secondary chlorination point thus its decay rate change is zero for a ring shaped wdn the vprc model must be updated when different water parcels mix at pipe junctions or in tanks the overall reactivity changes after water mixing because the water parcels contain different chlorine reactive species concentrations thus new k0 and kmix are required to be calculated according to eq 8 k0 is related to the chlorine reactive species in the filtered water thus when water mixing occurs k0 is updated k0 mix by calculating the mass weighted averages of the water parcels as follows 28 k 0 m i x j 1 n k j 0 v j j 1 n v j where vj l and kj 0 h 1 are the volume and variable rate coefficient of the jth water parcel respectively similarly according to the principle that the total amount of chlorine reactive species in the water is constant before and after mixing kt of the mixture is calculated as a function of mass weighted average rate coefficient by using eq 29 yielding 29 k t m i x δ c t m i x j 1 n k t m i x j δ c t m i x j v j j 1 n v j where k t m i x j and δ c t m i x j are the variable rate coefficient and chlorine concentration consumption related to the water volume vj jth water package immediately before water mixing respectively while k t m i x and δ c t m i x are the variable rate coefficient and chlorine concentration consumption in mixtures immediately after water mixing δ c t m i x is updated via eqs 28 and 29 2 3 model application for chlorine decay within a water distribution network the chlorine loss caused by the pipe wall must be considered in addition to the bulk chlorine loss calculated by the vprc model to predict the residual chlorine within a wdn according to eq 8 chlorine loss caused by the bulk reaction consumes chlorine reactive species and further decreases kt while chlorine loss caused by the pipe wall reaction does not decrease kt thus to make the variable rate coefficient independent of the chlorine consumed by reactions with the pipe wall δxt is calculated as follows 30 δ x t x m a x c 0 c r c t c w c m a x where cw is the aggregate chlorine consumption caused by the pipe wall mg l this study mainly explored the chlorine decay in bulk water however a chlorine wall decay model is also necessary to apply the vprc model for residual chlorine simulation in a wdn rossman 2000 lists several commonly used wall decay models which established the relationship of chlorine wall decay rate with the pipe diameter and chlorine concentration etc here d c w d t f r c is utilized to roughly express it the overall chlorine decay model is as follows 31 d c d t k 0 1 u c 0 c 1 c b 2 c f r c 32 d c b d t k 0 1 u c 0 i 1 n c r i c c w 2 c 33 d c w d t f r c 34 c t i c t i c r i 35 d c r i d t 0 where c0 is the initial chlorine concentration added to the filtered water mg l c1 is the chlorine concentration at the entrance of the wdn mg l and cb is the aggregate chlorine concentration consumption caused by the bulk reaction after water enters the wdn mg l additionally cr i equals zero until the water flows through the ith rechlorination locations in the wdns notably this study only focuses on the chlorine bulk model and the wall decay model maybe rely on the existing research results which will not be discussed here similarly chlorine loss attributed to the pipe wall not decreasing the coefficient value should be taken into account by other vrc type models which increase complexity of the vrc type models application within the wdn to some extent 3 materials and methods 3 1 water samples filtered water hrb was collected from a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in harbin china before final disinfection the dwtp processes include coagulation flocculation utilizing poly aluminum chloride followed by sedimentation through inclined tubes filtration through a shutter filter and chlorine disinfection to treat the low temperature low turbidity organic rich reservoir water 3 2 chlorine decay experiment chlorine data from various experiments were utilized in this study to evaluate the accuracy of the vprc model these experiments were divided into three types 1 chlorination at different iccs temperatures 2 rechlorination and 3 different water mixing proportions a chlorine stock solution obtained by diluting concentrated sodium hypochlorite solution with milliq ultrapure water was utilized to chlorinate the hrb water the chlorine stock solution volume was calculated based on the required icc and added to glass bottles containing the water sample utilizing a pipette after the water samples were thoroughly mixed with the chlorine stock solution the chlorine concentration was measured utilizing the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine colorimetric method ofapha 2005b to explore the effect of the icc or temperature on the parameter values 11 independent chlorine decay tests for hrb water were conducted utilizing different iccs and temperatures the iccs ranged from 1 3 mg l keep one decimal place and the selected temperatures were 4 15 23 and 28 c table 1 two or three chlorination experiments were performed for each temperature the rechlorination prediction accuracy of the vprc model was then evaluated based on the above chlorination experiments three rechlorination experiments were conducted after the initial chlorination at 28 and one rechlorination experiment was conducted after the initial chlorination at 4 the prediction accuracy of the vprc model after water mixing must also be evaluated based on the two chlorination experiments conducted at 23 c the two water samples with different iccs and chlorine concentrations were mixed in specific proportions for a period after initial chlorination 3 3 data analysis this study utilized the proposed vprc model and the first order model which was utilized for comparison to make each model represent the best fit of the experimental data determining the optimal parameters for both models were required the optimal parameters were obtained by minimizing the sum of the squared errors sse between the measured and modeled chlorine concentrations at each measurement time pineiro et al 2008 the first order model inaccurately simulates the rapid chlorine decay at the beginning of the reaction therefore the dataset excluding iccs is utilized for obtaining the optimal parameters of the first order model the root mean square error rmse is associated with sse and sample size n and its expression is rmse s s e n by contrast rmse is more suitable to represent the average error the correlation coefficient r2 is also often utilized to evaluate the differences between modeled and experimental data pineiro et al 2008 r2 values range from 0 1 with higher values indicating a better predictive capability and the sse and rmse values decrease with increasing r2 values otto 2007 the proposed vprc model requires the calibration of the k0 and u parameters unfortunately the true values of k0 cannot be derived and have a positive correlation with the value of u fig 1 thus u has to be determined a priori in order to calibrate the remaining model coefficients fisher et al 2011 determined that a suitable bulk chlorine decay model should accurately predict chlorine concentration over an extended period thus the relative error absolute value of the last measurement value in each chlorine decay data is utilized to reflect whether the model is still accurate in predicting the residual chlorine after a long decay which is significant to ensure certain residual chlorine at network endings fig 1 shows the relative errors absolute value and sse for chlorine decay hrb 2 3 mg l icc and 28 with different values of u notably the proposed vprc model is equivalent to the first order model when the value of u equals 0 the fitting results of all the chlorine decay have similar rules that sse decreases with the increase of u while the relative errors absolute value decrease first and then increases when u continues to increase after reaching a certain value the change of sse is no longer obvious here u is assumed equal to 30 l mg for each chlorine decay data although these factors are arbitrarily chosen it will be shown that the results from the calibrated vprc model are in good agreement with observed chlorine decay the coefficient of variation cv was introduced to validate that the k0 parameter of the vprc model obtained from chlorination tests with different iccs at a specific temperature was not significantly different if the cv value is less than 20 there is no significant relationship between the k0 and icc parameters validating the vprc model to obtain the optimal k0 value is required for chlorination tests however no additional model calibrations were required after rechlorination or water mixing the optimal k0 value is the same before and after rechlorination whereas the k0 and kmix value for mixtures is recalculated via eqs 28 29 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation for chlorination at different iccs temperatures to verify that the vprc model accurately estimated the chlorine residuals the model was first fitted to the entire chlorination dataset of hrb water samples for comparison the first order model which is the most commonly applied model to simulate chlorine residuals was also fitted to the same dataset excluding iccs the icc temperature combinations for each chlorination experiment are presented in table 2 for each water sample the optimal parameter values of the vprc and first order models were estimated by minimizing the sse between the measured and modeled chlorine concentrations at each measurement time and the optimal parameter and associated r2 and rmse values are presented in table 2 the vprc model has a smaller rmse at each temperature than that of the first order model further indicating its superior accuracy the cv values were calculated for the hrb water samples treated with different iccs at a given temperature to study the optimal parameter differences table 2 the cv values obtained at 28 23 15 and 4 utilizing the first order model and its optimal parameters were 54 23 37 5 115 39 and 68 27 respectively therefore icc is an important factor affecting the rate coefficient of the first order model additionally the cf of the first order model is significantly different from the actual icc these conclusions are consistent with previous studies and prove that the first order model does not meet criteria 3 and 5 for a suitable bulk chlorine decay model fisher et al 2011 in contrast at 28 23 15 and 4 c the cv values obtained utilizing the vprc model and its optimal parameter were 2 6 10 1 18 3 and 15 2 all less than 20 respectively indicating that the k0 parameter of the vprc model was not significantly different for any icc this result supports the eq 8 statement that k0 is independent of the icc the actual icc may be lower than the theoretical icc due to the possible presence of a small amount of chlorine residue on the experimental container wall therefore for a particular temperature performing minor icc adjustments until k0 decreases to the known minimum value is reasonable e g when the temperature is 28 c the known minimum k0 is 535 h 1 the adjusted icc cv for the chlorination dataset and the associated r2 and rmse values are presented in table 2 which shows that the cv and icc values are similar with adjustments less than 0 2 compared to the first order model the vprc model based on the cv and an identical k0 vprc model has superior accuracy due to its lower rmse value the measured chlorine concentrations and first order and vprc model estimations are presented in fig 2 based on these results the vprc model accurately simulates the rapid chlorine decay at the beginning of the reaction which the first order model inaccurately simulates the optimal parameter of the vprc model table 2 decreases with temperature and k0 decreases by four times when the temperature drops from 28 to 4 c which supports the statement that k0 is affected by temperature as per eq 8 the vprc model simulated chlorine decay at 28 c all r2 values exceeded 0 99 better than at other temperatures therefore it may be more applicable at higher temperatures the arrhenius plot of k0 versus 1 t presented in fig 3 was utilized to explore the relationship between the optimal parameter and temperature the fitted straight line slope indicates the ea r ratio and the associated r2 value is 0 933 powell et al 2000 determined that the ea r values obtained from other water sources are different and estimated an ea r range of 4660 9560 c while kastl et al 2003 obtained an ea r value of 14700 k for water fisher et al 2012 determined an ea r value of 5440 k for hrb water and this study determined a similar value of 5028 k therefore the result of this study is reasonable based on the k0 value at 28 c and the ea r value the k0 values at different temperatures can be calculated utilizing eq 23 4 2 model validation for rechlorination the experimental rechlorination data for hrb samples 1 3 and 11 table 3 were utilized to verify that the vprc model accurately predicts rechlorination as described in eqs 8 and 10 k0 and kt do not abruptly change before and after rechlorination in this study the minimum k0 occurs at a specific temperature as shown in table 2 e g k0 for hrb samples 1 3 is 535 h 1 and 129 h 1 for hrb 11 table 3 lists the associated r2 and rmse values between the modeled and observed chlorine concentrations the r2 values of hrb samples 1 3 and 11 were 0 980 0 975 0 990 and 0 975 exceeding 0 97 respectively moreover the experimental data are highly correlated with the predicted curve fig 4 thus the vprc model accurately predicts rechlorination without updating the model parameters 4 3 model validation for water mixing mixing experiments utilizing chlorinated samples hrb4 and hrb5 were conducted 4 3 h after initial chlorination and with different proportions to verify that the vprc model accurately predicts chlorine residual after water mixing however the chlorine concentrations of hrb4 and hrb5 at 4 3 h are unknown the vprc model was utilized to estimate the unmeasured chlorine concentrations due to its accuracy to predict the chlorine concentration after water mixing utilizing the vprc model the k0 mix and δct values are also required and are calculated via eqs 26 and 27 respectively these values are presented in table 3 with their associated r2 and rmse values between the predicted and observed chlorine concentrations fig 5 shows the chlorine decay calibration curves of hrb4 and hrb5 and the chlorine decay prediction curves of the hrb4 hrb5 mixtures with the mixing ratios of 1 3 and 3 1 an r2 value exceeding 0 97 indicates a good prediction of the measured chlorine concentration after water mixing 4 4 model implementation in water distribution networks similar to the vrrc model the vprc model also requires a relatively accurate initial chlorine concentration which is the premise of prediction for rechlorination and water mixing for output water at the entrance of the wdn the chlorine dosage for disinfection and the decay duration from disinfection to entry into the wdn are constantly changing and unknown thus the optimal parameter is always estimated via static experiments of output water whose chlorine has decayed for a while in this case utilizing the analytical solution to obtain the optimal parameter requires introducing a new parameter to represent the unknown decay duration from disinfection to entry into the wdn which increases the complexity and fallibility it can be found from eq 20 that any two measured data t1 ct1 and t2 ct2 have the following relationship 36 t 2 t 1 1 k 0 1 u c 0 2 l n c t 1 c t 2 1 k 0 c t 1 c t 2 2 u 2 u 2 c 0 u 2 2 c t 1 c t 2 although the values of t1 and t2 are difficult to determine the difference between them is known eq 36 follows the form of three dimensional custom equations δ t f c 1 c 2 thus its optimal parameter can be obtained via surface fitting the dataset excluding iccs of hrb 1 3 is utilized to estimate its accuracy and the fitting result is shown in fig 6 the r2 for hrb 1 3 all above 0 96 and the initial chlorine concentration is close to the actual value for the complex and intelligent chlorination system in drinking water treatment plants eq 36 provides an effective method to determine the model parameter the multi species extension of the epanet software epanet msx shang et al 2008 provides a flexible platform for users to define the chemical species and their simultaneous reactions for the vprc model c cw cb and cr i should be considered as chemical species and their simultaneous reactions are given in eqs 31 35 5 conclusion the proposed vprc model integrates variable reaction rate into the first order model providing a simple effective chlorine residual simulation method in a wdn according to the mathematical derivation the variable reaction rate kt decrease is caused by the consumption of chlorine reactive species in the water therefore the proposed model introduces a new variable called chlorine reactive species concentration consumption and utilizes its empirical equation to describe the variable reaction rate additionally the vprc model has an analytical solution based on the calibration and prediction results for different chlorine decay test conditions the vprc model has the following characteristics 1 the values of k0 were similar for all the tested iccs at the same temperature all cv values less than 20 2 the vprc model has a lower rmse and better data fitting accuracy than the first order model for chlorination utilizing different iccs and temperatures even when icc omitted from fitted data 3 the decrease of k0 with temperature satisfies the arrhenius equation and the ea r ratio for the hrb water sample is 5028 k which concurs with previous study findings 4 the vprc model accurately

16849,the first order model is the most widely utilized model for chlorine decay due to its having only one parameter and an analytical solution while variable reaction coefficient type models have higher accuracy and wider application range their widespread uses are hindered by their complexity and the non existence of an analytical solution the objective of this study was to develop a variable parabolic reaction coefficient model to simulate and predict chlorine decay in bulk water the decreasing reactivity of the reacting agents is included in a variable coefficient which decreases with increasing consumption of the chlorine reactive species concentration the model includes minimal parameters that must be calculated and an analytical solution was derived experimental data including chlorination with different initial chlorine concentrations or temperatures rechlorination and water mixing were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of the variable parabolic reaction coefficient model under different conditions the relationship between the parameters and temperature was established utilizing the arrhenius equation on the basis of assumptions that the chlorine consumed by reactions with the pipe wall does not decrease the variable rate coefficient this study subtracted the instantaneous aggregate chlorine wall consumption from the total chlorine consumption so that the parameter values in the vprc model derived from laboratory decay tests can be used in the system model for output water at the entrance of the wdn with unknown initial chlorine concentration and unknown decay duration from disinfection to entry into the water distribution network an effective method to determine the model parameter is proposed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine variable parabolic reaction coefficient analytical solution water distribution network 1 introduction disinfection as a barrier against the pathogenic microorganism in the water distribution system is a crucial process in water treatment poleneni 2020 chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant in the world due to its simplicity low cost and effectiveness etc jonkergouw et al 2009 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 however there are increasing concerns about the safety of chlorine disinfection chlorine reacting with natural organic matter nom in drinking water leads to by products that are known to be harmful to human health such as trihalomethane thm and haloacetic acids haas nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 richardson et al 2007 minimizing the amount of chlorine dose is a practical way to limit dbps formation but a chlorine residual is required to prevent re pollution and bacterial regrowth lechevallier 1999 therefore rechlorination at intermediate locations is usually utilized to enable the initial chlorine dose to be lowered and ensure a chlorine residual at network endings who 2004 generally the overall chlorine decay within a water distribution network wdn includes bulk and wall decay wang et al 2019 bulk decay refers to chlorine loss caused by its reaction with substances in the bulk water while wall decay is caused by the reaction of chlorine with the pipe wall and substances adhering to it such as biofilm and corrosion fisher et al 2011 stated that an accurate chlorine decay model for bulk water must be established before characterizing the pipe wall chlorine decay over the past several decades many models have been proposed to predict bulk chlorine decay the first order model proposed by johnson 1978 the most widely utilized in wdn software is presented in eq 1 as follows 1 d c t d t k c t where c0 is the initial chlorine concentration icc mg l ct is the chlorine concentration at time t mg l t is time h and k is the rate coefficient h 1 the analytical solution of eq 1 is as follows 2 c t c 0 e k t the first order model is simple and feasible because only a single parameter k is required to be determined and it has an analytical solution however it has not produced accurate data fitting in many applications clark 1998 kastl et al 1999 kohpaei and sathasivan 2011 additionally fisher et al 2011 determined that the representation of slower decay which occurs after rechlorination is difficult unless the model updates the rate coefficient value haas and karra 1984 proposed limited first parallel first and nth order models these models and the first order model assume that the chlorine reactive species concentration is significantly greater than the chlorine concentration therefore first order kinetics will not yield accurate results for drinking water contradicting this assumption to compensate for the first order kinetics deficiencies clark 1998 proposed a second order chlorine decay model and rossman 2000 provided a means to implement this decay model from time zero utilizing epanet software boccelli et al 2003 simplified the form of the second order model and proposed a method to update the model coefficients after rechlorination actually chlorine bulk decay is caused by a series of concurrent reactions with a multitude of chlorine reactive species jonkergouw et al 2009 the second order bilinear multiple reactant model is as follows 3 d c t d t c t i 1 n k i x i t where ct is the chlorine concentration at time t mg l xi t is the ith chlorine reactive species concentration at time t mg l and ki is the rate coefficient of the reaction between chlorine and the ith chlorine reactive species kastl et al 1999 simplified the second order bilinear multiple reactant model by dividing reactants into two constituents fast and slow reducing agents and proposed the following parallel second order model 4 d c t d t k f c t x f k s c t x s where ct is the chlorine concentration at time t mg l and xf and xs are the fast and slow reducing agent concentrations mg l respectively additionally kf and ks denote the rate coefficients of the fast and slow reactions h 1 respectively an alternative model which may have similar accuracy and efficiency is the variable reaction rate vrc model pioneered by jonkergouw et al 2009 in the vrc model jonkergouw et al 2009 defined a concentration weighted rate coefficient calculated by an empirical equation the parameter values of the vrc model are identical before and after rechlorination however the efficiency and complexity of the model are questioned due to its larger number of parameters shortly afterward on the basis of the vrc model hua et al 2015 proposed a variable reaction rate coefficient vrrc model which reduced the number of parameters and number of differential equations to three and one respectively however widespread uses of some models including the vrrc model are hindered by their complexity most importantly the non existence of an analytical solution jabari et al 2011 moreover the vrrc model requires a relatively accurate initial chlorine concentration value to reflect the ratio of chlorine consumption to the maximum chlorine demand thus obtaining an accurate initial chlorine concentration is the premise of prediction for rechlorine and water mixing in fact this value is difficult to obtain for output water at the entrance of the wdn due to the dynamic changes in chlorine dosage for disinfection and residence time from disinfection to entry into the wdn fisher et al 2011 determined that a suitable bulk chlorine decay model should meet the following five criteria 1 it accurately predicts chlorine concentration over an extended period 2 it is simple due to the requirement of minimal parameters 3 it utilizes actual icc rather than a calibration value 4 it utilizes identical parameter values before and after rechlorination and 5 the parameter values are identical for all iccs the first order model meets criteria 2 but it does not satisfy criteria 3 5 maybe meeting criteria 2 might be the key to applying the model in epanet the second order bilinear multiple reactant model may be the only appropriate way to satisfy criterion 4 however the multiple reactant theory based vrc model does not meet criterion 2 notably neither the concentration weighted rate coefficient nor the product of the variable rate coefficient and total reacting substance concentration k i x i t x i t and k i x i t respectively are related to the chlorine reactive species concentration whose loss is caused by bulk chlorine decay therefore chlorine loss attributed to the pipe wall is assumed not to decrease the coefficient value which must be included in any vrc type bulk chlorine decay model however previous vrc type chlorine bulk decay models do not consider this the purposes of this study are to 1 develop a simple second order bilinear multiple reactant model with a variable rate coefficient that reflects the decline in reactant reactivity via an empirical function with minimal parameters 2 derive the analytical solution of differential equation in the model 3 establish a relationship between the model parameters and temperatures utilizing the arrhenius equation 4 propose a model that makes the variable rate coefficient values independent of the chlorine loss caused by pipe wall reaction 5 compare the accuracies of the variable parabolic reaction coefficient vprc and first order models and 6 show the applicability of the model for simulating chlorine bulk decay including rechlorination and water mixing 2 model development 2 1 vprc model derivation chlorine bulk decay is caused by concurrent reactions with various chlorine reactive species in bulk water such as dissolved molecules ions insoluble solids and biotic and abiotic components gallard and von gunten 2002 warton et al 2006 jonkergouw et al 2009 expressed one of the reactions between chlorine and the ith chlorine reactive species as follows 5 c l x i k i p i where cl represents the chlorine component xi denotes the ith chlorine reactive species i 1 2 n and ki and pi denote the rate constant of the reaction and its disinfection byproduct respectively if the reaction with a single chlorine reactive species is first order the decay rate of xi can be described as follows 6 d x i t d t k i c t x i t where ct is the chlorine concentration at time t mg l xi t is the concentration of the ith chlorine reactive species at time t mg l and ki is the reaction rate coefficient for the ith chlorine reactive species by assuming the bulk chlorine decay is caused by n parallel reactions jonkergouw et al 2009 expressed the chlorine decay rate as follows 7 d c t d t i 1 n d x i t d t c t i 1 n k i x i t however accurate determinations of the reaction rate coefficient and the concentration of each chlorine reactive species are difficult therefore a new variable rate coefficient kt calculated as the sum of the product of the reaction rate coefficient ki and the chlorine reactive species concentration xi was utilized as follows 8 k t i 1 n k i x t i according to eq 8 kt is determined by the concentration of each chlorine reactive species and its reaction rate coefficient which is affected by temperature therefore kt does not abruptly change before and after rechlorination theoretically no relationship exists between k0 and the icc therefore to explore their characteristics eq 8 can be differentiated utilizing eq 6 as follows 9 d k t d t c t i 1 n k i 2 x t i eq 9 demonstrates that the rate of change in kt throughout the reaction is 1 negative i e kt decreases over time 2 related to the temperature that affects ki i e kt decreases faster at higher temperatures 3 positively correlated with the chlorine and chlorine reactive species concentrations and 4 decreases to nearly zero when the chlorine is nearly consumed the characteristics of kt obtained from eqs 8 and 9 are the criteria for establishing a new empirical equation to calculate kt however the direct determination of the relationship between kt and the chlorine concentration consumption is not appropriate in real wdns rechlorination and the pipe wall reaction change the chlorine concentration however based on eq 8 they do not change kt thus chlorine reactive consumption is introduced and kt is described as the following inverse proportional equation 10 k t k 0 1 α δ x t x m a x 2 where k0 is the initial kt h 1 δxt is the chlorine reactive species concentration consumption at time t mg l xmax is the chlorine reactive species concentration in the filtered water mg l and α is the model dimensionless parameter differentiation of eq 10 provides 11 d k t d t d k 0 1 α δ x t x m a x 2 d t 2 α k 0 k t c t x m a x 1 α δ x t x m a x 3 when kt is described by this empirical equation the characteristics of the rate of change in kt are the same as those of the variable rate coefficient in eq 9 in the absence of rechlorination or water mixing δ x t x max is related to the chlorine concentration as shown in eq 12 12 δ x t x m a x δ c t c m a x c 0 c t c m a x where δct is is the chlorine concentration consumption at time t cmax is the maximum chlorine demand mg l α and cmax are undetermined parameters in this study thus a new parameter u is utilized to describe them as follows 13 u α c m a x eq 10 can be rewritten utilizing eqs 12 and 13 as follows 14 k t k 0 1 u c 0 c t 2 and substituting eqs 8 and 14 into eq 7 produces the following 15 d c t d t k 0 1 u c 0 c t 2 c t which can be rearranged to the following 16 1 u c 0 2 c t d c t 2 u 1 u c 0 d c t u 2 c t d c t k 0 d t the solution of differential equations is derived from eq 16 as follows 17 1 u c 0 2 l n c t 2 u 1 u c 0 c t u 2 2 c t 2 k 0 t a the value of parameter a is obtained when t 0 via eq 17 as follows 18 a 1 u c 0 2 l n c 0 2 u 1 u c 0 c 0 u 2 2 c 0 2 substituting eq 18 into eq 17 results in 19 1 u c 0 2 l n c 0 c t 2 u 1 u c 0 c 0 c t u 2 2 c 0 2 c t 2 k 0 t which can be rearranged as 20 t 1 u c 0 2 k 0 l n c 0 c t u 2 k 0 c 0 c t 4 3 u c 0 u c t the final vprc model is as follows d c t d t k 0 1 u c 0 c t 2 c t or 21 t 1 u c 0 2 k 0 l n c 0 c t u 2 k 0 c 0 c t 4 3 u c 0 u c t 2 2 model application for chlorine decay at different scenarios temperature is an important factor affecting the chlorine decay rate and seasonal water temperatures should be considered to plan and manage real wdns successfully thus it is necessary to explore the relationships between the model parameters and temperature the inclusion of temperature variation in the model was performed via the fisher et al 2012 method which utilized the following classical arrhenius equation 22 l n k 0 e a r t c where t is the absolute temperature k k0 is the initial variable rate coefficient of the vprc model ea is the experimental activation energy j mol and r is the molar gas constant j mol k for ea r if the initial variable rate coefficient k1 0 at temperature t1 is known another initial variable rate coefficient k2 0 at temperature t2 can be calculated as follows 23 k 2 0 k 1 0 e x p e a t 1 t 2 r t 1 t 2 to determine the ea r value in this study a linear graph of lnk0 versus 1 t was drawn to obtain the slope ea r based on the chlorination at different temperatures in long distance wdns rechlorination at various locations throughout the network effectively ensures the residual chlorine concentration at the network endings and reduces disinfection by products updating the k0 parameter and variable rate coefficient kt is not required after rechlorination because according to eq 8 they only depend on temperature and chlorine reactive species concentration for the same reason δxt does not abruptly change before and after rechlorination therefore its expression would change to the following 24 δ x t x m a x c 0 c t c r c m a x where cr is the chlorine concentration increase caused by rechlorination mg l substituting eq 24 into eq 10 the vprc model for residual chlorine simulation including rechlorination is as follows 25 d c t d t k 0 1 u c 0 c r c t 2 c t notably there are many wdns in which more than one rechlorination is required when the water flows through n rechlorination locations the expression of cr is given as 26 c r i 1 n c r i where cr i is the chlorine concentration increase at the point of the ith rechlorination mg l for output water that has not reached any rechlorination locations the value of cr is zero meanwhile the chlorine concentration ct will increase abruptly and the increment is cr i when water flows through the ith secondary chlorination site thus ct has the following expression before and after rechlorination 27 c t i c t i c r i where c t i and c t i are the chlorine concentrations immediately before and after rechlorination respectively during the simulation cr i is equivalent to a tracker to determine whether the water passes the ith secondary chlorination point thus its decay rate change is zero for a ring shaped wdn the vprc model must be updated when different water parcels mix at pipe junctions or in tanks the overall reactivity changes after water mixing because the water parcels contain different chlorine reactive species concentrations thus new k0 and kmix are required to be calculated according to eq 8 k0 is related to the chlorine reactive species in the filtered water thus when water mixing occurs k0 is updated k0 mix by calculating the mass weighted averages of the water parcels as follows 28 k 0 m i x j 1 n k j 0 v j j 1 n v j where vj l and kj 0 h 1 are the volume and variable rate coefficient of the jth water parcel respectively similarly according to the principle that the total amount of chlorine reactive species in the water is constant before and after mixing kt of the mixture is calculated as a function of mass weighted average rate coefficient by using eq 29 yielding 29 k t m i x δ c t m i x j 1 n k t m i x j δ c t m i x j v j j 1 n v j where k t m i x j and δ c t m i x j are the variable rate coefficient and chlorine concentration consumption related to the water volume vj jth water package immediately before water mixing respectively while k t m i x and δ c t m i x are the variable rate coefficient and chlorine concentration consumption in mixtures immediately after water mixing δ c t m i x is updated via eqs 28 and 29 2 3 model application for chlorine decay within a water distribution network the chlorine loss caused by the pipe wall must be considered in addition to the bulk chlorine loss calculated by the vprc model to predict the residual chlorine within a wdn according to eq 8 chlorine loss caused by the bulk reaction consumes chlorine reactive species and further decreases kt while chlorine loss caused by the pipe wall reaction does not decrease kt thus to make the variable rate coefficient independent of the chlorine consumed by reactions with the pipe wall δxt is calculated as follows 30 δ x t x m a x c 0 c r c t c w c m a x where cw is the aggregate chlorine consumption caused by the pipe wall mg l this study mainly explored the chlorine decay in bulk water however a chlorine wall decay model is also necessary to apply the vprc model for residual chlorine simulation in a wdn rossman 2000 lists several commonly used wall decay models which established the relationship of chlorine wall decay rate with the pipe diameter and chlorine concentration etc here d c w d t f r c is utilized to roughly express it the overall chlorine decay model is as follows 31 d c d t k 0 1 u c 0 c 1 c b 2 c f r c 32 d c b d t k 0 1 u c 0 i 1 n c r i c c w 2 c 33 d c w d t f r c 34 c t i c t i c r i 35 d c r i d t 0 where c0 is the initial chlorine concentration added to the filtered water mg l c1 is the chlorine concentration at the entrance of the wdn mg l and cb is the aggregate chlorine concentration consumption caused by the bulk reaction after water enters the wdn mg l additionally cr i equals zero until the water flows through the ith rechlorination locations in the wdns notably this study only focuses on the chlorine bulk model and the wall decay model maybe rely on the existing research results which will not be discussed here similarly chlorine loss attributed to the pipe wall not decreasing the coefficient value should be taken into account by other vrc type models which increase complexity of the vrc type models application within the wdn to some extent 3 materials and methods 3 1 water samples filtered water hrb was collected from a drinking water treatment plant dwtp in harbin china before final disinfection the dwtp processes include coagulation flocculation utilizing poly aluminum chloride followed by sedimentation through inclined tubes filtration through a shutter filter and chlorine disinfection to treat the low temperature low turbidity organic rich reservoir water 3 2 chlorine decay experiment chlorine data from various experiments were utilized in this study to evaluate the accuracy of the vprc model these experiments were divided into three types 1 chlorination at different iccs temperatures 2 rechlorination and 3 different water mixing proportions a chlorine stock solution obtained by diluting concentrated sodium hypochlorite solution with milliq ultrapure water was utilized to chlorinate the hrb water the chlorine stock solution volume was calculated based on the required icc and added to glass bottles containing the water sample utilizing a pipette after the water samples were thoroughly mixed with the chlorine stock solution the chlorine concentration was measured utilizing the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine colorimetric method ofapha 2005b to explore the effect of the icc or temperature on the parameter values 11 independent chlorine decay tests for hrb water were conducted utilizing different iccs and temperatures the iccs ranged from 1 3 mg l keep one decimal place and the selected temperatures were 4 15 23 and 28 c table 1 two or three chlorination experiments were performed for each temperature the rechlorination prediction accuracy of the vprc model was then evaluated based on the above chlorination experiments three rechlorination experiments were conducted after the initial chlorination at 28 and one rechlorination experiment was conducted after the initial chlorination at 4 the prediction accuracy of the vprc model after water mixing must also be evaluated based on the two chlorination experiments conducted at 23 c the two water samples with different iccs and chlorine concentrations were mixed in specific proportions for a period after initial chlorination 3 3 data analysis this study utilized the proposed vprc model and the first order model which was utilized for comparison to make each model represent the best fit of the experimental data determining the optimal parameters for both models were required the optimal parameters were obtained by minimizing the sum of the squared errors sse between the measured and modeled chlorine concentrations at each measurement time pineiro et al 2008 the first order model inaccurately simulates the rapid chlorine decay at the beginning of the reaction therefore the dataset excluding iccs is utilized for obtaining the optimal parameters of the first order model the root mean square error rmse is associated with sse and sample size n and its expression is rmse s s e n by contrast rmse is more suitable to represent the average error the correlation coefficient r2 is also often utilized to evaluate the differences between modeled and experimental data pineiro et al 2008 r2 values range from 0 1 with higher values indicating a better predictive capability and the sse and rmse values decrease with increasing r2 values otto 2007 the proposed vprc model requires the calibration of the k0 and u parameters unfortunately the true values of k0 cannot be derived and have a positive correlation with the value of u fig 1 thus u has to be determined a priori in order to calibrate the remaining model coefficients fisher et al 2011 determined that a suitable bulk chlorine decay model should accurately predict chlorine concentration over an extended period thus the relative error absolute value of the last measurement value in each chlorine decay data is utilized to reflect whether the model is still accurate in predicting the residual chlorine after a long decay which is significant to ensure certain residual chlorine at network endings fig 1 shows the relative errors absolute value and sse for chlorine decay hrb 2 3 mg l icc and 28 with different values of u notably the proposed vprc model is equivalent to the first order model when the value of u equals 0 the fitting results of all the chlorine decay have similar rules that sse decreases with the increase of u while the relative errors absolute value decrease first and then increases when u continues to increase after reaching a certain value the change of sse is no longer obvious here u is assumed equal to 30 l mg for each chlorine decay data although these factors are arbitrarily chosen it will be shown that the results from the calibrated vprc model are in good agreement with observed chlorine decay the coefficient of variation cv was introduced to validate that the k0 parameter of the vprc model obtained from chlorination tests with different iccs at a specific temperature was not significantly different if the cv value is less than 20 there is no significant relationship between the k0 and icc parameters validating the vprc model to obtain the optimal k0 value is required for chlorination tests however no additional model calibrations were required after rechlorination or water mixing the optimal k0 value is the same before and after rechlorination whereas the k0 and kmix value for mixtures is recalculated via eqs 28 29 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation for chlorination at different iccs temperatures to verify that the vprc model accurately estimated the chlorine residuals the model was first fitted to the entire chlorination dataset of hrb water samples for comparison the first order model which is the most commonly applied model to simulate chlorine residuals was also fitted to the same dataset excluding iccs the icc temperature combinations for each chlorination experiment are presented in table 2 for each water sample the optimal parameter values of the vprc and first order models were estimated by minimizing the sse between the measured and modeled chlorine concentrations at each measurement time and the optimal parameter and associated r2 and rmse values are presented in table 2 the vprc model has a smaller rmse at each temperature than that of the first order model further indicating its superior accuracy the cv values were calculated for the hrb water samples treated with different iccs at a given temperature to study the optimal parameter differences table 2 the cv values obtained at 28 23 15 and 4 utilizing the first order model and its optimal parameters were 54 23 37 5 115 39 and 68 27 respectively therefore icc is an important factor affecting the rate coefficient of the first order model additionally the cf of the first order model is significantly different from the actual icc these conclusions are consistent with previous studies and prove that the first order model does not meet criteria 3 and 5 for a suitable bulk chlorine decay model fisher et al 2011 in contrast at 28 23 15 and 4 c the cv values obtained utilizing the vprc model and its optimal parameter were 2 6 10 1 18 3 and 15 2 all less than 20 respectively indicating that the k0 parameter of the vprc model was not significantly different for any icc this result supports the eq 8 statement that k0 is independent of the icc the actual icc may be lower than the theoretical icc due to the possible presence of a small amount of chlorine residue on the experimental container wall therefore for a particular temperature performing minor icc adjustments until k0 decreases to the known minimum value is reasonable e g when the temperature is 28 c the known minimum k0 is 535 h 1 the adjusted icc cv for the chlorination dataset and the associated r2 and rmse values are presented in table 2 which shows that the cv and icc values are similar with adjustments less than 0 2 compared to the first order model the vprc model based on the cv and an identical k0 vprc model has superior accuracy due to its lower rmse value the measured chlorine concentrations and first order and vprc model estimations are presented in fig 2 based on these results the vprc model accurately simulates the rapid chlorine decay at the beginning of the reaction which the first order model inaccurately simulates the optimal parameter of the vprc model table 2 decreases with temperature and k0 decreases by four times when the temperature drops from 28 to 4 c which supports the statement that k0 is affected by temperature as per eq 8 the vprc model simulated chlorine decay at 28 c all r2 values exceeded 0 99 better than at other temperatures therefore it may be more applicable at higher temperatures the arrhenius plot of k0 versus 1 t presented in fig 3 was utilized to explore the relationship between the optimal parameter and temperature the fitted straight line slope indicates the ea r ratio and the associated r2 value is 0 933 powell et al 2000 determined that the ea r values obtained from other water sources are different and estimated an ea r range of 4660 9560 c while kastl et al 2003 obtained an ea r value of 14700 k for water fisher et al 2012 determined an ea r value of 5440 k for hrb water and this study determined a similar value of 5028 k therefore the result of this study is reasonable based on the k0 value at 28 c and the ea r value the k0 values at different temperatures can be calculated utilizing eq 23 4 2 model validation for rechlorination the experimental rechlorination data for hrb samples 1 3 and 11 table 3 were utilized to verify that the vprc model accurately predicts rechlorination as described in eqs 8 and 10 k0 and kt do not abruptly change before and after rechlorination in this study the minimum k0 occurs at a specific temperature as shown in table 2 e g k0 for hrb samples 1 3 is 535 h 1 and 129 h 1 for hrb 11 table 3 lists the associated r2 and rmse values between the modeled and observed chlorine concentrations the r2 values of hrb samples 1 3 and 11 were 0 980 0 975 0 990 and 0 975 exceeding 0 97 respectively moreover the experimental data are highly correlated with the predicted curve fig 4 thus the vprc model accurately predicts rechlorination without updating the model parameters 4 3 model validation for water mixing mixing experiments utilizing chlorinated samples hrb4 and hrb5 were conducted 4 3 h after initial chlorination and with different proportions to verify that the vprc model accurately predicts chlorine residual after water mixing however the chlorine concentrations of hrb4 and hrb5 at 4 3 h are unknown the vprc model was utilized to estimate the unmeasured chlorine concentrations due to its accuracy to predict the chlorine concentration after water mixing utilizing the vprc model the k0 mix and δct values are also required and are calculated via eqs 26 and 27 respectively these values are presented in table 3 with their associated r2 and rmse values between the predicted and observed chlorine concentrations fig 5 shows the chlorine decay calibration curves of hrb4 and hrb5 and the chlorine decay prediction curves of the hrb4 hrb5 mixtures with the mixing ratios of 1 3 and 3 1 an r2 value exceeding 0 97 indicates a good prediction of the measured chlorine concentration after water mixing 4 4 model implementation in water distribution networks similar to the vrrc model the vprc model also requires a relatively accurate initial chlorine concentration which is the premise of prediction for rechlorination and water mixing for output water at the entrance of the wdn the chlorine dosage for disinfection and the decay duration from disinfection to entry into the wdn are constantly changing and unknown thus the optimal parameter is always estimated via static experiments of output water whose chlorine has decayed for a while in this case utilizing the analytical solution to obtain the optimal parameter requires introducing a new parameter to represent the unknown decay duration from disinfection to entry into the wdn which increases the complexity and fallibility it can be found from eq 20 that any two measured data t1 ct1 and t2 ct2 have the following relationship 36 t 2 t 1 1 k 0 1 u c 0 2 l n c t 1 c t 2 1 k 0 c t 1 c t 2 2 u 2 u 2 c 0 u 2 2 c t 1 c t 2 although the values of t1 and t2 are difficult to determine the difference between them is known eq 36 follows the form of three dimensional custom equations δ t f c 1 c 2 thus its optimal parameter can be obtained via surface fitting the dataset excluding iccs of hrb 1 3 is utilized to estimate its accuracy and the fitting result is shown in fig 6 the r2 for hrb 1 3 all above 0 96 and the initial chlorine concentration is close to the actual value for the complex and intelligent chlorination system in drinking water treatment plants eq 36 provides an effective method to determine the model parameter the multi species extension of the epanet software epanet msx shang et al 2008 provides a flexible platform for users to define the chemical species and their simultaneous reactions for the vprc model c cw cb and cr i should be considered as chemical species and their simultaneous reactions are given in eqs 31 35 5 conclusion the proposed vprc model integrates variable reaction rate into the first order model providing a simple effective chlorine residual simulation method in a wdn according to the mathematical derivation the variable reaction rate kt decrease is caused by the consumption of chlorine reactive species in the water therefore the proposed model introduces a new variable called chlorine reactive species concentration consumption and utilizes its empirical equation to describe the variable reaction rate additionally the vprc model has an analytical solution based on the calibration and prediction results for different chlorine decay test conditions the vprc model has the following characteristics 1 the values of k0 were similar for all the tested iccs at the same temperature all cv values less than 20 2 the vprc model has a lower rmse and better data fitting accuracy than the first order model for chlorination utilizing different iccs and temperatures even when icc omitted from fitted data 3 the decrease of k0 with temperature satisfies the arrhenius equation and the ea r ratio for the hrb water sample is 5028 k which concurs with previous study findings 4 the vprc model accurately predicts rechlorination r2 exceeds 0 97 without updating the k0 parameter 5 the vprc model accurately predicts chlorine decay after water mixing r2 exceeds 0 97 utilizing simple parameter calculations this study also determined that the kt is correlated with the chlorine reactive species concentration whose loss is caused by bulk chlorine decay therefore pipe wall chlorine loss does not reduce the kt value consequently a method to eliminate the influence of pipe wall chlorine consumption on the kt was proposed for the vprc model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was supported by the national
