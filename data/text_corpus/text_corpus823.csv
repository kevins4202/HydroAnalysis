4115,the use of green roofs to help mitigate storm water contributions to urban flooding has been gaining popularity but is hindered by the limited data on the performance of such roofs with regard to storm water runoff mitigation the underlying issue stems from the inherent complexity of modeling subsurface multiphase flow modeling of this phenomena requires calculating the contributions of substrate microstructure characteristics the influence of the wetting and non wetting phases upon each other and the effect of the microstructure on the wetting phase previously we have observed how the microstructure can affect detention however the quantification of this relationship is still missing in the present paper we present numerical simulations of wetting phase infiltration of a thin monodisperse packed bed in order to understand and quantify the impact of microstructure geometry on storm water infiltration of a green roof substrate for a slightly hydrophilic case Î¸ 82 we find that a dominant mechanism underlying this relationship is the microstructure induced dynamic behavior of the capillary pressure we determine that at larger packing ratios ratio of packed bed depth to particle size the influence of hydraulic head diminishes and behaves conversely for thinner layers particularly when larger pores are present indeed thin beds composed of large particles can exhibit high flow velocities that in turn affect the capillary pressure within the substrate we observe that the capillary pressure can shift from negative values denoting capillary suction to positive ones which cause valve like blocking effects on the flow dependent upon the flow velocity as determined by the microstructure in particular we find that the capillary pressure depends on the value of the pore scale gravity induced flow velocity quantified through a characteristic capillary number the provided quantification of this relationship can be invaluable from a design perspective to understand the behavior of capillary pressure of different substrates under a variety of flow rates prior to testing substrate candidates in addition a comparison of the behavior of the dynamic component of capillary pressure to other works is undertaken flow homogeneity is also found to be linked to the flow velocity and consequently to the microstructure keywords green roof microstructure porous media dynamic capillary pressure lattice boltzmann 1 introduction with the predicted increase in precipitation frequency and intensity in northern latitudes and the current issues regarding urban storm water management green roofs have emerged as an attractive technology for urban areas bliss et al 2009 green roofs are defined as any roof construction incorporating vegetation usually accompanied by additional layers of growth substrate drainage and waterproofing the primary driving forces for green roof usage are their ability to reduce peak storm water runoff loads through retention of water in the soil and vegetation as well as detention through mechanical processes within the soil or alternative drainage layer johannessen et al 2017 the term retention refers to the entrapment of liquid within the drainage layer as well as in the vegetation and is removed through evapotranspiration detention is defined as the ability of the drainage and vegetation layers to impede liquid infiltration and drainage thus lowering the peak flow intensity and lengthening the drainage period much research has been done both experimentally and using a variety of modeling approaches to accurately quantify these benefits while experiments have been able to provide information regarding the hydrological performance of different layering designs and types of vegetation under both laboratory and in situ conditions accurately capturing the behavior from the modeling perspective has remained elusive typically the computational methods used to evaluate the hydrological performance of green roofs are taken from soil science and those used in the petrochemical industry these models at the macroscopic scale are directly based upon the richards equation for unsaturated flow or a multiphase model derived from darcy s law they require additional equations in order to describe the relationship between the wetting and non wetting phases in the simplest case water and air or water and oil as well as the solid liquid interactions this inter relationship has been the subject of widespread academic research for the better half of a century largely due to the complexity of the physical process and consequent challenges in predicting the behavior of the system during both infiltration and drainage the complexity is appreciably increased when ones considers the variability in geometrical characteristics that define the microstructure of a porous medium in most works on the topic of flow through porous media be it at the macroscopic or microscopic scale require a few fundamental definitions provided here the relationship between the liquid phases and the solid porous matrix is commonly formalized by the equations relating capillary pressure saturation and permeability capillary pressure p c is defined as the difference between the wetting and non wetting liquid pressures p w and p nw respectively calculated on either side of the phasic interface 1 p c p w p nw saturation is given by the total wetting phase present in the porous matrix within a defined volume over the total void space within that volume permeability is a measure of the ability of a liquid to penetrate a porous matrix and is comprised of an intrinsic or absolute permeability as well as a relative permeability intrinsic permeability is a property of the material and is calculated by the single phase flow through the porous medium whereas relative permeability is a measure of the effect a wetting and non wetting phase apply to each other within the porous network unsurprisingly relative permeability is difficult to quantify as it relies on the amount of each phase present locally and may not be spatially homogeneous in addition the effect of dynamic contact angles defined to be different on the advancing and retreating sides of the wetting phase adds another layer of complexity it is precisely these difficulties that hinder modeling of this phenomenon for both imbibition and drainage processes in a unified manner we provide a discussion of previous works using a variety of approaches to better connect the work presented in this paper with the larger field of study 1 1 previous research one aspect of the transport of heat and fluids within a porous network that is not inconsequential is the contribution of evaporation though not the first luis segura identified evaporation as a contributing factor in the drying or pore networks by solving flow driven by evaporation and pressure gradient forces over a simplistic network he determined that as the drying process progressed the primary driving force shifted from pressure gradient at higher liquid saturation to evaporative dominant behavior at lower saturation values segura 2007 shokri et al examined the influence on partially wetted porous media and showed that hydrophilic media allow for larger rates of evaporation than in hydrophobic media shokri and lehmann 2009 they also determined that initial evaporation is driven by capillary induced flow whereas vapour diffusion dominates in later stages of the process confirming prior observations shahraeeni and or investigated the effect of liquid bridges on vapor diffusion as a mechanism for evaporation and confirmed previous works that as saturation increases the vapor diffusion is dominated by capillary action within the networks as postulated by philip and devries earlier they also showed that inducing a mild thermal gradient in the vapor phase almost doubly increases the flux when compared to an inert vapor phase shahraeeni and or 2012 we mention this contribution due to its proven relevance to fluid transport in porous however within this work we consider an isothermal system and thus evaporation is neglected the processes of drainage and imibibition have long been observed to behave dissimilarly with regard to the changes in permeability and saturation as well as other properties of the flow and soil matrix this difference known as hysteresis is caused by the interactions of the liquid phases with each other as well as the solid matrix morphology and physical properties this phenomenon has led many researchers to attempt to determine alternative formulations that that of the most common empirical models which make use of the relationship between permeability capillary pressure and saturation to describe this process these models such as the van genuchten 1980 purcell 1949 and brooks and corey 1964 require experimental data with which to fit the curves for a complete description of the hysteresis to be generated a good overview of these models is given by li and horne 2006 experimental approaches to generate the required data vary with wayllace and lu 2012 presenting a novel transient water release and imbibition twri method to rapidly capture the soil water retention curve swrc and hydraulic conductivity function under both drying and wetting conditions gallage et al used dual liquid tensiometers to validate their accuracy for sandy soils gallage et al 2013 soltani et al carried out a statistical analysis of model parameters in order to generate swrc curves for different soil classes rather than individual experimental datasets removing direct subjectivity of the resulting curves soltani et al 2019 siltecho et al provide an overview of many of the experimental methods and outline their respective strengths and weaknesses siltecho et al 2015 as an alternative to the use of empirical functions to close the problem at a macroscopic level many other researchers have attempted to find additional parameters linked to the ones previously mentioned in order to better explain the physical process and allow for a bijective function to describe the changes this requires the direct solution of the flow at the pore scale and several numerical methods are used for this purpose the lattice boltzmann method lbm has been used extensively for this purpose due to its inherent advantages i its ease of coding ii the ease of parallelization for quick computing iii and its ability to handle complex boundaries commonly found in porous media work by li et al described the influence of geometrical properties on steady state fluid distribution and capillary pressure in a variety of 2d porous matrices li et al 2018 suh et al examined the effect of irregularly shaped pore throats on the capillary pressure within the matrix and concluded the use of the mayer and stowe princen theory in lieu of the traditional young laplace approach provides good agreement with experimental data suh et al 2017 porter et al undertook an examination of the influence of interfacial area in addition to the capillary pressure saturation interaction and determined that its inclusion as a variable in such models removes the need for scanning curves to accurately represent the hysteretic nature of the imbibition drainage process porter et al 2009 schlÃ¼ter et al investigated the validity of using an euler characteristic as a measure of the fluid topology to determine the aforementioned interactions and compared the results to experimental data with good agreement schlÃ¼ter et al 2016 liu et al employed a similar technique to quantify pore structure influence on capillary flow liu et al 2017 landry et al determined the effect of homogeneous wet and mixed wet porous media on permeability and found results in line with experimental data regarding the trends of the fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces landry et al 2014 li et al employed a fem approach with a zero thickness interface element to solve unsaturated flow in fully 3d porous media li et al 2017 the results showed accurate capturing of the wetting front as well as flow velocity and pressure distribution within the network several researchers have opted to solve the navier stokes equations directly at the pore scale amiri and hamouda investigated the influences of viscosity capillarity wettability and heterogeneity on flow in 2d porous media by solving a non isothermal system using fem and the navier stokes equations coupled with the phase field method akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 a similar methodology was employed by janetti et al to quantify the effect of pore scale geometry and wettability on permeability in ordered and random elementary cells janetti et al 2017 the impact on permeability in regular cells was found to be caused by the wettability of the solid whereas in random cells the contribution of geometry was found to be paramount ferrari et al made use of the volume of fluid vof method to investigate fingering length and width as well as interfacial area evolution in 2d and 3d settings ferrari et al 2015 jeff gostick and fellow researchers have developed an open source pore network modeling software openpnm gostick et al 2016 and tested its efficacy against direct numerical solvers such as fem and lbm methods the results showed that for the computational expenditure the more simplistic pore network models provide good accuracy dependent upon discretization schemes used sadeghi et al 2020 the models are based upon the advection diffusion equation but incorporate the use of power law and hybrid finite difference schemes as well as the analytical solution to the 1d advection diffusion equation vogel et al 2005 performed a comparison between a pore network model a lattice boltzmann approach and a continuum model on determining the soil water retention curve and found the pore network model to be the best option for cost the limitation of the lattice boltzmann method was the regularized lattice which had difficulty capturing thin films within the pores primkulov et al 2019 introduced a moving capacitor pore network model which models the fluid fluid interfaces as moving capacitors within the more traditional pore network model fixed resistor approach this model allows the capturing of displacement patterns and the injection pressure signal under a larger variety of capillary numbers and wettabilities qin et al have shown that multiform idealized pore elements used in pore network modeling in combination with the young laplace equation result in an over prediction of the capillary force at the wetting front this result in an over prediction of the imbibition rate qin and van brummelen 2019 the hysteresis in the advancing and retreating contact angle has also been studied in detail with researchers aiming to fully resolve the physics occurring along the moving contact line raiskinmÃ¤ki et al simulated capillary rise using lattice boltzmann and determined a dependence of the contact angle on capillary number as well as a more complex behavior in the presence of gravity raiskinmÃ¤ki et al 2002 several other researchers have provided a thorough explanation of the behavior reported in raiskinmÃ¤ki et al and fully described capillary rise in a cylinder of constant diameter in mathematical terms this detailed description can be found in such works as athukorallage and iyer 2016 and mikeliÄ 2003 similar derivations have been shown for two phase flow in a thin strip of variable width as an analogue to idealized porous media the derivation results in a darcy like formulation with a capillary pressure saturation relation including dynamic effects this derivation made use of the mathematical technique known as homogenization lunowa et al 2021 similarly to mikeliÄ benzi et al studied the behavior of the contact angle through the modification of two parameters within lattice boltzmann the equivalent of the wall density and the wall fluid potential as in molecular dynamics benzi et al 2006 and compared the results to experimental data with good agreement sbragaglia et al determined a critical capillary number for wherein the interface shifts from stationary to non stationary within a couette flow they also compared sharp interface models to diffuse ones and determined a limit of applicability for the latter sbragaglia et al 2008 latva kokko et al showed the scaling of dynamic contact angles with regard to the capillary number and determined the slip length follows the classic navier slipping wherein the velocity of the flow at the wall is proportional to the viscous stress at the wall this slip length is proportional to the viscous length scale associated with spurious flow induced by the three phase singularity latva kokko and rothman 2007 1 2 non equilibrium effects the studies discussed above are evaluated at equilibrium and thus do not give any insight into the dynamic quantities and their impact on multiphase flow through porous media by equilibrium we mean that the liquid velocities are zero and the interface between the phases is stable in 1987 weitz et al studied the dependence of velocity and capillary pressure and their impact on viscous fingering and determined the dynamic component of capillary pressure to have a stabilizing effect on the formation of viscous fingers weitz et al 1987 cueto felgueroso and juanes employed a continuum model based upon thin film flow models to capture the effect of surface tension without introducing new independent parameters and found good agreement with experimental results this work also confirmed the phenomenon wherein finger velocity and width increase with higher liquid infiltration velocity cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 in 2012 hilpert developed a model based upon the generalized green ampt approach and showed its ability to correctly estimate the capillary pressure overshoot depending upon upstream and downstream liquid content as well as solid grain size this formulation of capillary pressure is velocity dependent as well as dependent upon liquid content hilpert 2012 in 2011 lÃ¸voll et al performed experiments on liquid primary drainage and were able to generate collapsed curves relating the capillary number of a system and its corresponding pressure saturation curve they also postulated that the dynamic effects in the capillary pressure may be a combination of the viscous effects from the wetting phase in conjunction with the capillary pressure along the direction of the gaseous phase front lÃ¸voll et al 2011 work by joekar niasar et al has focused on employing pore network modeling with the addition of a dynamic capillary term to more accurately solve two phase flow in a porous medium joekar niasar et al 2010 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 also reported are many results from experimental determinations of coefficient values for the strength of dynamic contributions to capillary pressure as determined by other researchers they investigated the non equilibrium capillary effects under drainage and imbibition as a function of saturation viscosity ratio and effective viscosity manthey et al proposes an additional nondimensional number the dynamic number to aid in relating the dynamic capillary to viscous forces as well as gravity values are characterized as a function of characteristic length and flow velocity with front width found to be the best length scale manthey et al 2008 1 3 aim of current work in previous work we have examined the impact of microstructure on infiltration dynamics particularly the relationship between particle sizes and porous layer thickness in combination with variable hydraulic pressures applied to the porous surface pettersson et al 2020 it was determined that the particle packing influences the infiltration rate and homogeneity as determined by resultant pore size distribution and interfacial area this work constitutes a complementary analysis of the microstructure influence on capillary pressure resultant flow velocity and a measure of the capillary number in particular we show the effect of packing thickness on capillary behavior ranging from cases where capillary suction forces dominate the infiltration dynamics to those wherein the capillarity opposes the primary flow gradient we also observe an increased likelihood of the occurrence of fingering which follows through the resultant competition between gravitational and capillary forces at the pore scale a predictive relationship is described for dynamic capillary pressure and flow velocity based on the porous microstructure which may be applied to aid in the design of substrates with regard to packing flow velocity and green roof detention a comparison is also drawn to the previously reported behavior of the dynamic component of capillary pressure 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation characterization parameters several simulations are constructed and run to reflect differing conditions of rainfall intensity and soil design resulting in nine distinct domain configurations each domain consists of a porous subdomain and a void subdomain wherein the porous section acts as an analogue for a thin layer of soil with height h and the void domain allows for the initialization of the rain water as the wetting phase fig 1 shows all of the relevant domain measurements that are introduced below 2 1 1 geometry and flow parameters the porous subdomain is constructed as a randomly packed bed of monodisperse spherical particles with variable particle diameter d the random packing was performed using the software blender which has been shown to be an effective method of generating such a packing as by boccardo et al 2015 five distinct porous layers are generated by modifying the particle diameter and porous subdomain height h while maintaining adherence to the particle size minimum domain dimension requirement for a representative volume as defined in galindo torres et al 2016 the particle sizes were chosen to reflect the properties of lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca in addition to the porous subdomain height the domain length perpendicular to the primary flow direction is given as l an is chosen such that the restriction for wall impact on the flow field is satisfied the wetting phase is generated within the void subdomain as a layer of thickness h that lies directly above the porous subdomain this is to reflect the hydrostatic pressure applied appropriate to surface water under extreme rainfall conditions in gothenburg sweden as calculated directly from meteorological data from smhi pettersson et al 2020 the simulations are run with periodic boundary conditions in the primary flow direction and symmetric conditions in the lateral directions it is worth to note that the setup is run as a falling head simulation such that the water height decreases in time rather than a constant head or pressure flux condition this is to prevent any artificial forcing from a pressure condition or from a fixed flux condition which we can not know the magnitude of a priori we consider a two phase water vapour system whose physical properties are the wetting and non wetting phase density Ï w Ï nw and dynamic viscosity Î¼ nw Î¼ w in addition we define the constant values for gravity g and surface tension Î³ the simulated system is characterized by a density ratio and dynamic viscosity ratio of 35 the value of the density ratio is limited compared to real applications so that we must consider that inertial effects are underestimated in our computations however we can correctly represent a two phase system with the viscosity ratio close to real applications and thus accurately take into account the viscous effects that are dominant in low velocity flows in porous media with capillary numbers much smaller than one as the ones encountered during rain infiltration in green roof substrates 2 1 2 dimensionless parameters in order to characterize the studied system three characteristic dimensionless quantities are chosen a dimensionless packing ratio Ï h d is defined and acts as a measure of the thickness of particle layering within the porous subdomain this parameter is used to categorize the effect of the packing particularly as it effects not only the mean pore size but also the local porosity along the packing direction amore thorough discussion may be found in pettersson et al 2020 another parameter representing the dimensionless wetting phase height is given as h h d this parameter represents a measure of the approximate pore sizes in the microstructure against the applied hydrostatic pressure from the surface we assume the particle size to be of the same magnitude as pore size for a randomly packed bed as determined in previous work pettersson et al 2020 the final characteristic quantity is the pore scale characteristic capillary number 2 ca c u c Î¼ w Î³ 3 u c Ï w gd 2 Î¼ w where u c is the pore scale characteristic velocity the pore scale capillary number represents the importance of gravity induced viscous forces over surface tension at the pore scale the values for each of the dimensionless parameters is given in table 1 it is important to mention that prior to running the multiphase simulations a study was undertaken to determine appropriate lattice resolution as a failure in this regard will lead to erroneous results the lattice resolution used in this work is the result of a grid convergence test the details of which can be found in pettersson et al 2020 2 2 lattice boltzmann method the numerical method employed in this work is identical to that which is used in our previous works pettersson et al 2020 farzaneh et al 2021 therefore we will not provide all information in full detail but rather give a brief overview of the methodology used the lattice boltzmann method solves the boltzmann particle transport equation which includes motion through streaming as well as collisions it is an ideal choice for solving flows in porous media due to the complex geometry involved and allows for detailed information of the flow dynamics to be extracted at the pore scale the system is solved on a lattice structure wherein each lattice element consists of a centroid and nodes placed on a cubic convex hull small scale mass and momentum are distributed along the lattice nodes governed by probabilities appropriate for the chosen lattice geometry such that the macroscopic properties of the fluid are preserved succi 2001 a 3d regular cubic lattice with 19 degrees of freedom for movement d3q19 is used and the solved equation is of the form 4 f r x c r Î´ t t Î´ t f r x t Ï 1 f r x t f r eq x t f r where f r x t is the distribution function at position x and time t along the r th direction c r is the so called discrete velocity vector along the r th direction over time interval Î´ t f r eq is the equilibrium distribution function and Ï is the mean collision time and is related to kinematic viscosity by Î½ c s 2 Ï 0 5 Î´ t a body force f r as formulated by guo guo et al 2002 is applied to the fluid which mimics the effect of gravity and is given by 5 f r 1 1 2 Ï w r c r u c s 2 c r u c s 4 c r Ï g with g representing gravitational acceleration u the fluid velocity w r is the weighting parameter Ï is the density c s is the speed of sound and u eq is the chen equilibrium velocity chen et al 2014 calculated as 6 u eq Ï u Ï 1 2 f sc the shan chen fluid interaction formulation shan and chen 1993 is used to model the surface tension using an inter particle force that can act via attraction or repulsion of particles in the collision operator in addition to elastic collisions a pseudo potential function Ï Ï determines the interaction strength between the phases and in combination with the the shan chen force closes the system with the resultant non ideal equation of state this equation of state describes the thermodynamic equilibrium between the phases respective of order of introduction these equations are 7 f sc g Ï x t r w r Ï x c r Î´ t t c r 8 Ï Ï 1 e Ï 9 p Ï c s 2 g 2 c s 2 Ï 2 where g 5 5 is the interaction strength between the phases attraction occurs when

sc a moving wetting nonwetting phase contact line characterized by a contact angle chosen under equilibrium conditions is used to determine the interaction between the solid and wetting phases this contact angle is determined by young s equation and is calculated using spatial averaging of the pseudo potential function the de maio et al 2011 formulation for the force at the solid wall Ï wall is of the form 12 Ï wall Ï n 1 n Ï Î´ w where Ï is the density dependent function and n the nearest fluid computational nodes Î´ w represents a surplus density which can be tuned to exhibit the behavior of different contact angles the method requires enforcement of a constant density gradient at the walls and additional information regarding Î´ w and the contact angle can be found in benzi et al 2006 in this work the equilibrium contact angle is fixed at Î´ w 0 02 corresponding to Î¸ 82 which represents a slightly hydrophilic material found in materials used in green roofs such as leca it is also noteworthy that the lattice boltzmann method has an equilibrium contact angle no applied force however in the presence of other mechanical forces acting on the interface this angle can change slightly 3 results and discussion we wish to examine the infiltration patterns qualitatively for each particle value of Ï approximately halfway through the simulation run time corresponding to the 250 000th timestep t 172 the results are plotted in fig 2 it appears that the infiltration has almost reached the bottom of the porous layer in all configurations however in b and c there seems to be less homogeneity of the wetting front certainly in c we can see on the right corner a zone where infiltration has stalled after the initial particle layers this is consistent with the established notion that greater energy is required to advance the wetting front over the greater surface area which causes more inhomogeneous infiltration patterns when subjected to identical conditions as seen in our previous investigation pettersson et al 2020 in order to examine the interdependence of velocity and saturation sat we introduce the effective capillary number ca eff which is calculated as 13 ca eff d sat d t h Î¼ w Î³ u Î¼ w Î³ where the velocity is given by the rate of overall stream wise infiltration over time saturation is calculated by summing the total nodes occupied by the wetting phase and dividing by the total available void space within the porous domain subsection in fig 3 we see an overall decrease in velocity as the saturation increases for all cases this decrease of ca eff as a function of saturation remains almost constant after the initial phase of infiltration through the uppermost layer this can attributed to our definition of the infiltrating velocity and the increasing viscous resistance to the infiltration fluid as saturation increases when the packing ratio is larger as in a and b we see little effect of the hydrostatic pressure h on infiltration velocity however when the packing ratio is small as in c we observe a larger variation in the infiltration rate along with little distinction between the initial stage and subsequent infiltration rate this observation suggests that when the packing ratio is small the magnitude of the hydraulic pressure has a substantial effect on the flow dynamics given also that dynamic effects and gravitational forces at the pore scales larger ca c become important this impact on the fluid velocity can be better understood when one examines the capillary pressure within the porous network in fig 4 we plot the dimensionless capillary pressure saturation curves and see a correlation regarding Ï and the corresponding capillary pressure with lower values exhibiting hydrophobic characteristics the capillary pressure using the method reported in appendix a and is non dimensionalized by dividing the pressure by the ratio of surface tension to particle size 14 p 0 Î³ d 15 p c p w p nw p 0 in fig 4 we observe a trend of the average values of the capillary pressure over differing values of Ï and ca c similar to that of the effective capillary number in the case of large Ï a we clearly see that the applied hydrostatic pressure has almost no effect on the capillary pressure the only notable difference between the cases pictured in a is the negative shift in the case with lower pore scale velocity the values of the capillary pressures are negative in all cases in a where ca c is low indicating that capillary suction is occurring as a mechanism for pore infiltration a similar effect can be seen when the packing ratio is reduced and the pore scale velocity is thus increased while in b we see much the same behavior it is worthwhile to point out that the average value of the capillary pressure is less negative than in the prior cases indicating a weakening of the capillary suction contribution it can also be seen that oscillations in the pressure with greater magnitude occur which may be due to the greater forces required to overcome the surface tension resistance for invasion of the larger pores this trend is continued in c where the capillary pressure is now positive on average denoting a capillary action acting against the flow the magnitudes of the oscillations are still present and indeed in this case the values of the capillary pressure are more similar which clearly shows the role of the pore scale velocity on determining the capillary pressure rather than the hydrostatic pressure the cases with lower values of Ï exhibit the behavior of a valve like barrier on the flow as defined by positive values of capillary pressure this positive capillary pressure has been found to appear in cases with higher injected fluid velocity as firstly described by weitz et al 1987 weitz et al showed that dynamic capillary pressure is dependent upon this injected fluid velocity this effect has also been observed in cases where a non wetting fluid is displacing a more dense wetting fluid under gravitational forces lÃ¸voll et al 2011 in the cases investigated herein a more dense fluid is invading a less dense one in such a case we observe a similar general dynamic trend of the capillary pressure whereby increasing the pore scale gravitational effects ca c we notice an increase of the capillary pressure we also observe a marked effect of the packing ratio determining the porous microstructure this observation tells us that it is possible to regulate the capillary pressure by modifying the particle packing as a means to regulate the flow behavior within the system in order to get a better idea of the interdependence of the velocity capillary pressure saturation and microstructure we attempt to collapse all cases onto a single curve fig 5 displays the time averaged capillary pressure as a function of the characteristic capillary number the average for the capillary pressure is calculated as shown 16 p c 1 t end t 0 t 0 t end p c t d t the time averaging neglects the first time instance wherein the infiltration rate constitute outlier values due to initialization of the infiltrating liquid thus t 0 represents the second saved iteration and t t end represents an iteration whereat the effective capillary number becomes smaller than a given threshold value that indicates negligible infiltration here set at ca eff 10 4 in fig 5 the results have been plotted and are clustered by packing ratio the points show an excellent correlation between the time averaged capillary pressure and ca c across the threshold from negative to positive values of capillary pressure a similar relationship is shown for instance in weitz et al however in that work the dynamic contribution to capillary pressure is related to velocity by the equation 17 p c Î² 1 kn ca x 18 n ca Î¼ u Î³ where Î² d r th is the ratio of particle diameter d to r th with r th some characteristic pore throat radius n ca is the capillary number and k x are fitting parameters representing the strength of the dynamic contribution dependent upon initial velocity we choose to use the characteristic capillary number rather than the weitz definition as they controlled the entry velocities whereas in our case the medium velocities are determined by the competition between gravitational and surface tension forces acting at the pore scale thus the dynamic contribution to capillary forces formulated though ca c is expected to depend on the pore size as predicted by eqs 2 and 3 with larger pores inducing a larger dynamic effect on the pore scale pressure distribution despite the differences in the investigated physical system we see a striking similarity in the results when we apply a least squares fit of our collapsed data points to the modified equation of weitz et al as shown in fig 5 it is worth pointing out as well that the results reported in their work were taken at equilibrium conditions whereas in our work we use a time averaged capillary pressure but the relationship still holds the cases with the highest Ï value exhibit a lower capillary pressure and the values scale directly as we decrease Ï they range from capillary suction dominated to more neutral in terms of the driving force for infiltration the clustering remains similar for Ï 10 1 and Ï 6 7 however the capillary pressure is shifted more in the positive direction denoting decreasing influence of capillary suction driven infiltration weitz reported values of Î² 4 1 0 4 whereas in our worth the value is 2 7 which is very similar the same holds true for k 30 5 versus 5 in this work and finally x 0 5 0 1 this close agreement shows the physical consistency of our results with experimental work as well as a method by which the capillary forces can be predicted as a function of the characteristic capillary number it should also be noted here that capillary pressure is determined by the characteristic capillary number and not on the hydrostatic effects represented by h ultimately by modifying the packing ratio we can alter the capillary pressure by way of increasing the pore sizes resultant by choosing larger particles this observation can be invaluable from a design perspective to aid in understanding the behavior of capillary pressure of different substrates under a variety of chosen conditions prior to extensive testing 3 1 modeling infiltration with dynamic capillary pressure we make use of the washburn equation washburn 1921 to aid in elucidating the link between the behavior of the effective capillary number the capillary pressure and the weitz fit as shown in fig 5 we can thus formulate the following proportionality 19 d sat d t h d 2 Î¼ w 1 sath Ï w g h sath p c where the first term within brackets on the right hand side represents the contribution of gravity induced forces and the second term on the right hand side the capillary action this proportionality is consistent with the well known washburn relation of infiltration length in our case saturation proportional to the square root of time if the gravitational component is neglected and the capillary pressure is constant as in the classical definition as a result of this formulation we express the effective capillary number introduced earlier in a similar manner 20 ca eff ca c h sat Ï sat Ï p c sat Ï we see an inverse relationship between the effective capillary number and saturation occurs when either the gravity induced forces are absent ca c 0 or the infiltration is low low value of sat this relationship can be seen in fig 3 as we have a sufficiently low infiltration for this proportionality to occur this also explains why we see faster infiltration in the beginning of the simulations particularly as the packing ratio is decreased in magnitude in addition as saturation increases we expect to see a decrease in effective capillary number which again is visible in fig 3 in all cases from eq 20 we also see that when the value of the packing ratio Ï is low large pores compared to medium thickness the contribution of the first term on the right hand side of eq 20 to the infiltration dynamics i e the gravitational term is increased however as our analysis on the effective capillary pressure reveals see fig 5 low packing ratios likely trigger positive values of capillary pressures which in turn counteract the gravitational contribution in other words low packing ratios and large particles induces significant gravitational forces high ca c which determine a faster initial infiltration rapidly slowed down by a dynamic capillary force acting adversely to the flow 3 2 comparison of dynamic capillary contribution in order to compare these results concerning the behavior of the dynamic capillary pressure we compare our results to that of other researchers several such models can be found in manthey et al 2005 and results of many efforts have been reported in joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 the comparison can be done by way of plotting the changes in saturation against the capillary pressure as given by 21 p c 1 Ï p 0 d sat d t in fig 6 we plot the change in saturation infiltration rate against the capillary pressure the results give an approximation of the dynamic capillary pressure coefficient Ï the infiltration rate is non dimensionalized using the characteristic viscous time t v d 2 Î½ w we can see clearly we have a quasi linear dependence indicative of a constant value for tau for high values of infiltration it is clear however that the model does not work for low infiltration rates and low values of Ï where this quasi linear dependence is lost 3 3 infiltration homoegeneity in fig 7 we plot the probability distribution functions pdfs of infiltration depth at timestep t lb 250 000 and examine the resultant distributions in these cases homogeneous infiltration is characterized by a singular spike near 0 whereas less homogeneous flow is shown by bimodal behavior as well as less extreme slopes in a we see two of the three cases exhibit a tighter distribution around the mean infiltration depth denoting a more homogeneous wetting front however the case with higher hydraulic pressure exhibits less homogeneity in both b and c we see similarly less homogeneous infiltration patterns with the exception of the case where h 15 ca c 0 167 where once again the infiltration appears more homogeneous this aberration in the results can be explained by the quick convergence of this case to an equilibrium state due to the high hydraulic pressure applied the general observed trend suggests that when increasing the hydraulic pressure and reducing the packing ratio while the flow exhibits higher infiltration rates the suction mechanism hydrophilicity is inhibited and an adverse capillary pressure arises this pressure induces less homogeneous infiltration patterns in observing this trend of less homogeneous flow for lower Ï values we have shown that by applying an initial hydrostatic pressure above a certain threshold to the system we can increase the dynamic capillary pressure as defined in this work and generate the conditions under which the porous medium acts in a hydrophobic manner slowing the resultant wetting phase velocity within the pores this lower velocity generates higher occurrences of fingering which is consistent with the works of weitz et al 1987 and cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 thus by choosing a particular packing ratio one can effectively determine the infiltration rate of the system by bringing about the conditions wherein an inherently hydrophilic or borderline material can act in a hydrophobic manner this particular property can be of use in designing green roof soil substrates where a particle size can be chosen with a specific hydraulic load to behave in a hydrophobic manner and slow pore infiltration by layering differently sized particle one can create a system that acts differently under different hydraulic loads without resorting to overly thick individual layers this can reduce material use and weight applied to the structure depending on the material chosen 4 conclusion this work provides an analysis of the impact of the porous microstructure on infiltration dynamics of thin porous media by establishing the relationships between saturation dynamic capillary pressure effective capillary number and characteristic capillary number the infiltration rate of media with a larger packing ratio is largely unaffected by the magnitude of hydraulic pressure whereas in for lower values of the packing ratio the hydraulic pressure plays a more significant role this is due to the fact that dynamic effects and gravitational forces at the pore scales larger ca c become important an inverse relationship between the effective capillary number and saturation occurs when either the gravity induced forces are absent or the infiltration is low as is seen in this work we see that the capillary pressure depends only upon ca c and as the packing ratio decreases capillary suction is no longer the dominant driver of infiltration and in the most extreme cases the capillarity acts against the infiltration gradient in a valve like manner the relationship between the characteristic capillary number and time averaged capillary pressure is collapsed onto a singular plot and fit to an empirical function derived from experimental work this model allows us to represent the effects of the microstructure and the resulting infiltration rate on the capillary pressure present within the medium by combining the classic washburn solution for infiltration with the power law scaling of the capillary pressure we show that is possible to predict the infiltration within different substrates microstructures under different rain intensity events this can be invaluable from a design perspective to understand the behavior of capillary pressure of different substrates under a variety of chosen flow rates prior to extensive testing a comparison is made to the works of other researches with regard to the contribution of the dynamic component of the capillary pressure with good agreement observed indicating the validity of the method proposed in this work to capture this effect accurately in addition flow homogeneity is dependent upon the capillary pressure which when acting against the infiltrating wetting phase contributes to fingering of the flow within the porous matrix while the results in this work are consistent with the findings of other researchers it should be noted that several assumptions have been made in the work the fixed equilibrium contact angle the lack of any thermal contribution the use idealized packed spherical beds and the omission of drainage within the work these aspects should be addressed in order for future works to approach a more realistic case and thus represent opportunities for future investigation credit authorship

for computing snic at hpc2n partially funded by the swedish research council through grant agreement no 2018 05973 appendix a the capillary pressure is calculated for every time step in the manner described here each interface within the medium is determined and the pressure on each side is calculated as an average value within a specified number of nodes of the interface due to the diffuse nature of the interface of this lattice boltzmann approach a threshold value is chosen to determine which nodes are assigned as the liquid and wetting phase all of the calculated capillary pressures at all interfaces are stored for each iteration along with their locations and a statistical analysis is undertaken for each timestep resulting in a mean and standard error value for the capillary pressure in fig 8 an example interface is shown and the density profile across it is plotted an examination of the standard errors of the capillary pressures at each timestep was undertaken and were neglected from fig 4 on the basis of their magnitude in order to improve figure clarity appendix b a quantification of the dynamic component of the capillary pressure in terms of a coefficient that other researches have used to isolate this contribution is attempted while a direct comparison is difficult as our cases are run fully in a dynamic environment and thus an equilibrium capillary pressure is not calculable we have opted to approximate this coefficient as defined by kalaydjian 1987 whose model is strictly only valid for cylindrical pores the formulation is given as 22 p c 2 r Î³ Ï k sat t where r is the pore throat radius and Ï k is the fitting parameter representing the strength of the dynamic contribution we note here that a range of values for r were tested by calculating the left hand side as the capillary pressure we plot the evolution of Ï k as a function of saturation in fig 9 if one compares to results reported in joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 with m 1 and Ï k sat 0 we capture the dynamic capillary pressure contribution to the flow and how it increases as higher levels of saturation are reached while other researchers have reported the value of Ï to be exclusively positive we see here that its value is negative in several cases wherein r 5 is taken as an average pore throat though a range of values were tested it is very important to stress here that the mathematical models using the damping term require that Ï k 0 for the existence of a solution as outlined in mikelic 2010 koch et al 2013 and cao and pop 2016 some of our results do not conform with this restriction as we have here provided only a single rough estimate of the equilibrium capillary pressure indeed if we reduce the average pore throat radius we eliminate any negative values for Ï k rather than focus solely on the value of Ï k we would stress more its evolution in time which appears to be quasi linear particularly at lower values of saturation which again matches results reported by others though its value oscillates wildly when higher saturation values are reached 
4115,the use of green roofs to help mitigate storm water contributions to urban flooding has been gaining popularity but is hindered by the limited data on the performance of such roofs with regard to storm water runoff mitigation the underlying issue stems from the inherent complexity of modeling subsurface multiphase flow modeling of this phenomena requires calculating the contributions of substrate microstructure characteristics the influence of the wetting and non wetting phases upon each other and the effect of the microstructure on the wetting phase previously we have observed how the microstructure can affect detention however the quantification of this relationship is still missing in the present paper we present numerical simulations of wetting phase infiltration of a thin monodisperse packed bed in order to understand and quantify the impact of microstructure geometry on storm water infiltration of a green roof substrate for a slightly hydrophilic case Î¸ 82 we find that a dominant mechanism underlying this relationship is the microstructure induced dynamic behavior of the capillary pressure we determine that at larger packing ratios ratio of packed bed depth to particle size the influence of hydraulic head diminishes and behaves conversely for thinner layers particularly when larger pores are present indeed thin beds composed of large particles can exhibit high flow velocities that in turn affect the capillary pressure within the substrate we observe that the capillary pressure can shift from negative values denoting capillary suction to positive ones which cause valve like blocking effects on the flow dependent upon the flow velocity as determined by the microstructure in particular we find that the capillary pressure depends on the value of the pore scale gravity induced flow velocity quantified through a characteristic capillary number the provided quantification of this relationship can be invaluable from a design perspective to understand the behavior of capillary pressure of different substrates under a variety of flow rates prior to testing substrate candidates in addition a comparison of the behavior of the dynamic component of capillary pressure to other works is undertaken flow homogeneity is also found to be linked to the flow velocity and consequently to the microstructure keywords green roof microstructure porous media dynamic capillary pressure lattice boltzmann 1 introduction with the predicted increase in precipitation frequency and intensity in northern latitudes and the current issues regarding urban storm water management green roofs have emerged as an attractive technology for urban areas bliss et al 2009 green roofs are defined as any roof construction incorporating vegetation usually accompanied by additional layers of growth substrate drainage and waterproofing the primary driving forces for green roof usage are their ability to reduce peak storm water runoff loads through retention of water in the soil and vegetation as well as detention through mechanical processes within the soil or alternative drainage layer johannessen et al 2017 the term retention refers to the entrapment of liquid within the drainage layer as well as in the vegetation and is removed through evapotranspiration detention is defined as the ability of the drainage and vegetation layers to impede liquid infiltration and drainage thus lowering the peak flow intensity and lengthening the drainage period much research has been done both experimentally and using a variety of modeling approaches to accurately quantify these benefits while experiments have been able to provide information regarding the hydrological performance of different layering designs and types of vegetation under both laboratory and in situ conditions accurately capturing the behavior from the modeling perspective has remained elusive typically the computational methods used to evaluate the hydrological performance of green roofs are taken from soil science and those used in the petrochemical industry these models at the macroscopic scale are directly based upon the richards equation for unsaturated flow or a multiphase model derived from darcy s law they require additional equations in order to describe the relationship between the wetting and non wetting phases in the simplest case water and air or water and oil as well as the solid liquid interactions this inter relationship has been the subject of widespread academic research for the better half of a century largely due to the complexity of the physical process and consequent challenges in predicting the behavior of the system during both infiltration and drainage the complexity is appreciably increased when ones considers the variability in geometrical characteristics that define the microstructure of a porous medium in most works on the topic of flow through porous media be it at the macroscopic or microscopic scale require a few fundamental definitions provided here the relationship between the liquid phases and the solid porous matrix is commonly formalized by the equations relating capillary pressure saturation and permeability capillary pressure p c is defined as the difference between the wetting and non wetting liquid pressures p w and p nw respectively calculated on either side of the phasic interface 1 p c p w p nw saturation is given by the total wetting phase present in the porous matrix within a defined volume over the total void space within that volume permeability is a measure of the ability of a liquid to penetrate a porous matrix and is comprised of an intrinsic or absolute permeability as well as a relative permeability intrinsic permeability is a property of the material and is calculated by the single phase flow through the porous medium whereas relative permeability is a measure of the effect a wetting and non wetting phase apply to each other within the porous network unsurprisingly relative permeability is difficult to quantify as it relies on the amount of each phase present locally and may not be spatially homogeneous in addition the effect of dynamic contact angles defined to be different on the advancing and retreating sides of the wetting phase adds another layer of complexity it is precisely these difficulties that hinder modeling of this phenomenon for both imbibition and drainage processes in a unified manner we provide a discussion of previous works using a variety of approaches to better connect the work presented in this paper with the larger field of study 1 1 previous research one aspect of the transport of heat and fluids within a porous network that is not inconsequential is the contribution of evaporation though not the first luis segura identified evaporation as a contributing factor in the drying or pore networks by solving flow driven by evaporation and pressure gradient forces over a simplistic network he determined that as the drying process progressed the primary driving force shifted from pressure gradient at higher liquid saturation to evaporative dominant behavior at lower saturation values segura 2007 shokri et al examined the influence on partially wetted porous media and showed that hydrophilic media allow for larger rates of evaporation than in hydrophobic media shokri and lehmann 2009 they also determined that initial evaporation is driven by capillary induced flow whereas vapour diffusion dominates in later stages of the process confirming prior observations shahraeeni and or investigated the effect of liquid bridges on vapor diffusion as a mechanism for evaporation and confirmed previous works that as saturation increases the vapor diffusion is dominated by capillary action within the networks as postulated by philip and devries earlier they also showed that inducing a mild thermal gradient in the vapor phase almost doubly increases the flux when compared to an inert vapor phase shahraeeni and or 2012 we mention this contribution due to its proven relevance to fluid transport in porous however within this work we consider an isothermal system and thus evaporation is neglected the processes of drainage and imibibition have long been observed to behave dissimilarly with regard to the changes in permeability and saturation as well as other properties of the flow and soil matrix this difference known as hysteresis is caused by the interactions of the liquid phases with each other as well as the solid matrix morphology and physical properties this phenomenon has led many researchers to attempt to determine alternative formulations that that of the most common empirical models which make use of the relationship between permeability capillary pressure and saturation to describe this process these models such as the van genuchten 1980 purcell 1949 and brooks and corey 1964 require experimental data with which to fit the curves for a complete description of the hysteresis to be generated a good overview of these models is given by li and horne 2006 experimental approaches to generate the required data vary with wayllace and lu 2012 presenting a novel transient water release and imbibition twri method to rapidly capture the soil water retention curve swrc and hydraulic conductivity function under both drying and wetting conditions gallage et al used dual liquid tensiometers to validate their accuracy for sandy soils gallage et al 2013 soltani et al carried out a statistical analysis of model parameters in order to generate swrc curves for different soil classes rather than individual experimental datasets removing direct subjectivity of the resulting curves soltani et al 2019 siltecho et al provide an overview of many of the experimental methods and outline their respective strengths and weaknesses siltecho et al 2015 as an alternative to the use of empirical functions to close the problem at a macroscopic level many other researchers have attempted to find additional parameters linked to the ones previously mentioned in order to better explain the physical process and allow for a bijective function to describe the changes this requires the direct solution of the flow at the pore scale and several numerical methods are used for this purpose the lattice boltzmann method lbm has been used extensively for this purpose due to its inherent advantages i its ease of coding ii the ease of parallelization for quick computing iii and its ability to handle complex boundaries commonly found in porous media work by li et al described the influence of geometrical properties on steady state fluid distribution and capillary pressure in a variety of 2d porous matrices li et al 2018 suh et al examined the effect of irregularly shaped pore throats on the capillary pressure within the matrix and concluded the use of the mayer and stowe princen theory in lieu of the traditional young laplace approach provides good agreement with experimental data suh et al 2017 porter et al undertook an examination of the influence of interfacial area in addition to the capillary pressure saturation interaction and determined that its inclusion as a variable in such models removes the need for scanning curves to accurately represent the hysteretic nature of the imbibition drainage process porter et al 2009 schlÃ¼ter et al investigated the validity of using an euler characteristic as a measure of the fluid topology to determine the aforementioned interactions and compared the results to experimental data with good agreement schlÃ¼ter et al 2016 liu et al employed a similar technique to quantify pore structure influence on capillary flow liu et al 2017 landry et al determined the effect of homogeneous wet and mixed wet porous media on permeability and found results in line with experimental data regarding the trends of the fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces landry et al 2014 li et al employed a fem approach with a zero thickness interface element to solve unsaturated flow in fully 3d porous media li et al 2017 the results showed accurate capturing of the wetting front as well as flow velocity and pressure distribution within the network several researchers have opted to solve the navier stokes equations directly at the pore scale amiri and hamouda investigated the influences of viscosity capillarity wettability and heterogeneity on flow in 2d porous media by solving a non isothermal system using fem and the navier stokes equations coupled with the phase field method akhlaghi amiri and hamouda 2014 a similar methodology was employed by janetti et al to quantify the effect of pore scale geometry and wettability on permeability in ordered and random elementary cells janetti et al 2017 the impact on permeability in regular cells was found to be caused by the wettability of the solid whereas in random cells the contribution of geometry was found to be paramount ferrari et al made use of the volume of fluid vof method to investigate fingering length and width as well as interfacial area evolution in 2d and 3d settings ferrari et al 2015 jeff gostick and fellow researchers have developed an open source pore network modeling software openpnm gostick et al 2016 and tested its efficacy against direct numerical solvers such as fem and lbm methods the results showed that for the computational expenditure the more simplistic pore network models provide good accuracy dependent upon discretization schemes used sadeghi et al 2020 the models are based upon the advection diffusion equation but incorporate the use of power law and hybrid finite difference schemes as well as the analytical solution to the 1d advection diffusion equation vogel et al 2005 performed a comparison between a pore network model a lattice boltzmann approach and a continuum model on determining the soil water retention curve and found the pore network model to be the best option for cost the limitation of the lattice boltzmann method was the regularized lattice which had difficulty capturing thin films within the pores primkulov et al 2019 introduced a moving capacitor pore network model which models the fluid fluid interfaces as moving capacitors within the more traditional pore network model fixed resistor approach this model allows the capturing of displacement patterns and the injection pressure signal under a larger variety of capillary numbers and wettabilities qin et al have shown that multiform idealized pore elements used in pore network modeling in combination with the young laplace equation result in an over prediction of the capillary force at the wetting front this result in an over prediction of the imbibition rate qin and van brummelen 2019 the hysteresis in the advancing and retreating contact angle has also been studied in detail with researchers aiming to fully resolve the physics occurring along the moving contact line raiskinmÃ¤ki et al simulated capillary rise using lattice boltzmann and determined a dependence of the contact angle on capillary number as well as a more complex behavior in the presence of gravity raiskinmÃ¤ki et al 2002 several other researchers have provided a thorough explanation of the behavior reported in raiskinmÃ¤ki et al and fully described capillary rise in a cylinder of constant diameter in mathematical terms this detailed description can be found in such works as athukorallage and iyer 2016 and mikeliÄ 2003 similar derivations have been shown for two phase flow in a thin strip of variable width as an analogue to idealized porous media the derivation results in a darcy like formulation with a capillary pressure saturation relation including dynamic effects this derivation made use of the mathematical technique known as homogenization lunowa et al 2021 similarly to mikeliÄ benzi et al studied the behavior of the contact angle through the modification of two parameters within lattice boltzmann the equivalent of the wall density and the wall fluid potential as in molecular dynamics benzi et al 2006 and compared the results to experimental data with good agreement sbragaglia et al determined a critical capillary number for wherein the interface shifts from stationary to non stationary within a couette flow they also compared sharp interface models to diffuse ones and determined a limit of applicability for the latter sbragaglia et al 2008 latva kokko et al showed the scaling of dynamic contact angles with regard to the capillary number and determined the slip length follows the classic navier slipping wherein the velocity of the flow at the wall is proportional to the viscous stress at the wall this slip length is proportional to the viscous length scale associated with spurious flow induced by the three phase singularity latva kokko and rothman 2007 1 2 non equilibrium effects the studies discussed above are evaluated at equilibrium and thus do not give any insight into the dynamic quantities and their impact on multiphase flow through porous media by equilibrium we mean that the liquid velocities are zero and the interface between the phases is stable in 1987 weitz et al studied the dependence of velocity and capillary pressure and their impact on viscous fingering and determined the dynamic component of capillary pressure to have a stabilizing effect on the formation of viscous fingers weitz et al 1987 cueto felgueroso and juanes employed a continuum model based upon thin film flow models to capture the effect of surface tension without introducing new independent parameters and found good agreement with experimental results this work also confirmed the phenomenon wherein finger velocity and width increase with higher liquid infiltration velocity cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 in 2012 hilpert developed a model based upon the generalized green ampt approach and showed its ability to correctly estimate the capillary pressure overshoot depending upon upstream and downstream liquid content as well as solid grain size this formulation of capillary pressure is velocity dependent as well as dependent upon liquid content hilpert 2012 in 2011 lÃ¸voll et al performed experiments on liquid primary drainage and were able to generate collapsed curves relating the capillary number of a system and its corresponding pressure saturation curve they also postulated that the dynamic effects in the capillary pressure may be a combination of the viscous effects from the wetting phase in conjunction with the capillary pressure along the direction of the gaseous phase front lÃ¸voll et al 2011 work by joekar niasar et al has focused on employing pore network modeling with the addition of a dynamic capillary term to more accurately solve two phase flow in a porous medium joekar niasar et al 2010 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 also reported are many results from experimental determinations of coefficient values for the strength of dynamic contributions to capillary pressure as determined by other researchers they investigated the non equilibrium capillary effects under drainage and imbibition as a function of saturation viscosity ratio and effective viscosity manthey et al proposes an additional nondimensional number the dynamic number to aid in relating the dynamic capillary to viscous forces as well as gravity values are characterized as a function of characteristic length and flow velocity with front width found to be the best length scale manthey et al 2008 1 3 aim of current work in previous work we have examined the impact of microstructure on infiltration dynamics particularly the relationship between particle sizes and porous layer thickness in combination with variable hydraulic pressures applied to the porous surface pettersson et al 2020 it was determined that the particle packing influences the infiltration rate and homogeneity as determined by resultant pore size distribution and interfacial area this work constitutes a complementary analysis of the microstructure influence on capillary pressure resultant flow velocity and a measure of the capillary number in particular we show the effect of packing thickness on capillary behavior ranging from cases where capillary suction forces dominate the infiltration dynamics to those wherein the capillarity opposes the primary flow gradient we also observe an increased likelihood of the occurrence of fingering which follows through the resultant competition between gravitational and capillary forces at the pore scale a predictive relationship is described for dynamic capillary pressure and flow velocity based on the porous microstructure which may be applied to aid in the design of substrates with regard to packing flow velocity and green roof detention a comparison is also drawn to the previously reported behavior of the dynamic component of capillary pressure 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulation characterization parameters several simulations are constructed and run to reflect differing conditions of rainfall intensity and soil design resulting in nine distinct domain configurations each domain consists of a porous subdomain and a void subdomain wherein the porous section acts as an analogue for a thin layer of soil with height h and the void domain allows for the initialization of the rain water as the wetting phase fig 1 shows all of the relevant domain measurements that are introduced below 2 1 1 geometry and flow parameters the porous subdomain is constructed as a randomly packed bed of monodisperse spherical particles with variable particle diameter d the random packing was performed using the software blender which has been shown to be an effective method of generating such a packing as by boccardo et al 2015 five distinct porous layers are generated by modifying the particle diameter and porous subdomain height h while maintaining adherence to the particle size minimum domain dimension requirement for a representative volume as defined in galindo torres et al 2016 the particle sizes were chosen to reflect the properties of lightweight expanded clay aggregate leca in addition to the porous subdomain height the domain length perpendicular to the primary flow direction is given as l an is chosen such that the restriction for wall impact on the flow field is satisfied the wetting phase is generated within the void subdomain as a layer of thickness h that lies directly above the porous subdomain this is to reflect the hydrostatic pressure applied appropriate to surface water under extreme rainfall conditions in gothenburg sweden as calculated directly from meteorological data from smhi pettersson et al 2020 the simulations are run with periodic boundary conditions in the primary flow direction and symmetric conditions in the lateral directions it is worth to note that the setup is run as a falling head simulation such that the water height decreases in time rather than a constant head or pressure flux condition this is to prevent any artificial forcing from a pressure condition or from a fixed flux condition which we can not know the magnitude of a priori we consider a two phase water vapour system whose physical properties are the wetting and non wetting phase density Ï w Ï nw and dynamic viscosity Î¼ nw Î¼ w in addition we define the constant values for gravity g and surface tension Î³ the simulated system is characterized by a density ratio and dynamic viscosity ratio of 35 the value of the density ratio is limited compared to real applications so that we must consider that inertial effects are underestimated in our computations however we can correctly represent a two phase system with the viscosity ratio close to real applications and thus accurately take into account the viscous effects that are dominant in low velocity flows in porous media with capillary numbers much smaller than one as the ones encountered during rain infiltration in green roof substrates 2 1 2 dimensionless parameters in order to characterize the studied system three characteristic dimensionless quantities are chosen a dimensionless packing ratio Ï h d is defined and acts as a measure of the thickness of particle layering within the porous subdomain this parameter is used to categorize the effect of the packing particularly as it effects not only the mean pore size but also the local porosity along the packing direction amore thorough discussion may be found in pettersson et al 2020 another parameter representing the dimensionless wetting phase height is given as h h d this parameter represents a measure of the approximate pore sizes in the microstructure against the applied hydrostatic pressure from the surface we assume the particle size to be of the same magnitude as pore size for a randomly packed bed as determined in previous work pettersson et al 2020 the final characteristic quantity is the pore scale characteristic capillary number 2 ca c u c Î¼ w Î³ 3 u c Ï w gd 2 Î¼ w where u c is the pore scale characteristic velocity the pore scale capillary number represents the importance of gravity induced viscous forces over surface tension at the pore scale the values for each of the dimensionless parameters is given in table 1 it is important to mention that prior to running the multiphase simulations a study was undertaken to determine appropriate lattice resolution as a failure in this regard will lead to erroneous results the lattice resolution used in this work is the result of a grid convergence test the details of which can be found in pettersson et al 2020 2 2 lattice boltzmann method the numerical method employed in this work is identical to that which is used in our previous works pettersson et al 2020 farzaneh et al 2021 therefore we will not provide all information in full detail but rather give a brief overview of the methodology used the lattice boltzmann method solves the boltzmann particle transport equation which includes motion through streaming as well as collisions it is an ideal choice for solving flows in porous media due to the complex geometry involved and allows for detailed information of the flow dynamics to be extracted at the pore scale the system is solved on a lattice structure wherein each lattice element consists of a centroid and nodes placed on a cubic convex hull small scale mass and momentum are distributed along the lattice nodes governed by probabilities appropriate for the chosen lattice geometry such that the macroscopic properties of the fluid are preserved succi 2001 a 3d regular cubic lattice with 19 degrees of freedom for movement d3q19 is used and the solved equation is of the form 4 f r x c r Î´ t t Î´ t f r x t Ï 1 f r x t f r eq x t f r where f r x t is the distribution function at position x and time t along the r th direction c r is the so called discrete velocity vector along the r th direction over time interval Î´ t f r eq is the equilibrium distribution function and Ï is the mean collision time and is related to kinematic viscosity by Î½ c s 2 Ï 0 5 Î´ t a body force f r as formulated by guo guo et al 2002 is applied to the fluid which mimics the effect of gravity and is given by 5 f r 1 1 2 Ï w r c r u c s 2 c r u c s 4 c r Ï g

calculated as 6 u eq Ï u Ï 1 2 f sc the shan chen fluid interaction formulation shan and chen 1993 is used to model the surface tension using an inter particle force that can act via attraction or repulsion of particles in the collision operator in addition to elastic collisions a pseudo potential function Ï Ï determines the interaction strength between the phases and in combination with the the shan chen force closes the system with the resultant non ideal equation of state this equation of state describes the thermodynamic equilibrium between the phases respective of order of

sc a moving wetting nonwetting phase contact line characterized by a contact angle chosen under equilibrium conditions is used to determine the interaction between the solid and wetting phases this contact angle is determined by young s equation and is calculated using spatial averaging of the pseudo potential function the de maio et al 2011 formulation for the force at the solid wall Ï wall is of the form 12 Ï wall Ï n 1 n Ï Î´ w where Ï is the density dependent function and n the nearest fluid computational nodes Î´ w represents a surplus density which can be tuned to exhibit the behavior of different contact angles the method requires enforcement of a constant density gradient at the walls and additional information regarding Î´ w and the contact angle can be found in benzi et al 2006 in this work the equilibrium contact angle is fixed at Î´ w 0 02 corresponding to Î¸ 82 which represents a slightly hydrophilic material found in materials used in green roofs such as leca it is also noteworthy that the lattice boltzmann method has an equilibrium contact angle no applied force however in the presence of other mechanical forces acting on the interface this angle can change slightly 3 results and discussion we wish to examine the infiltration patterns qualitatively for each particle value of Ï approximately halfway through the simulation run time corresponding to the 250 000th timestep t 172 the results are plotted in fig 2 it appears that the infiltration has almost reached the bottom of the porous layer in all configurations however in b and c there seems to be less homogeneity of the wetting front certainly in c we can see on the right corner a zone where infiltration has stalled after the initial particle layers this is consistent with the established notion that greater energy is required to advance the wetting front over the greater surface area which causes more inhomogeneous infiltration patterns when subjected to identical conditions as seen in our previous investigation pettersson et al 2020 in order to examine the interdependence of velocity and saturation sat we introduce the effective capillary number ca eff which is calculated as 13 ca eff d sat d t h Î¼ w Î³ u Î¼ w Î³ where the velocity is given by the rate of overall stream wise infiltration over time saturation is calculated by summing the total nodes occupied by the wetting phase and dividing by the total available void space within the porous domain subsection in fig 3 we see an overall decrease in velocity as the saturation increases for all cases this decrease of ca eff as a function of saturation remains almost constant after the initial phase of infiltration through the uppermost layer this can attributed to our definition of the infiltrating velocity and the increasing viscous resistance to the infiltration fluid as saturation increases when the packing ratio is larger as in a and b we see little effect of the hydrostatic pressure h on infiltration velocity however when the packing ratio is small as in c we observe a larger variation in the infiltration rate along with little distinction between the initial stage and subsequent infiltration rate this observation suggests that when the packing ratio is small the magnitude of the hydraulic pressure has a substantial effect on the flow dynamics given also that dynamic effects and gravitational forces at the pore scales larger ca c become important this impact on the fluid velocity can be better understood when one examines the capillary pressure within the porous network in fig 4 we plot the dimensionless capillary pressure saturation curves and see a correlation regarding Ï and the corresponding capillary pressure with lower values exhibiting hydrophobic characteristics the capillary pressure using the method reported in appendix a and is non dimensionalized by dividing the pressure by the ratio of surface tension to particle size 14 p 0 Î³ d 15 p c p w p nw p 0 in fig 4 we observe a trend of the average values of the capillary pressure over differing values of Ï and ca c similar to that of the effective capillary number in the case of large Ï a we clearly see that the applied hydrostatic pressure has almost no effect on the capillary pressure the only notable difference between the cases pictured in a is the negative shift in the case with lower pore scale velocity the values of the capillary pressures are negative in all cases in a where ca c is low indicating that capillary suction is occurring as a mechanism for pore infiltration a similar effect can be seen when the packing ratio is reduced and the pore scale velocity is thus increased while in b we see much the same behavior it is worthwhile to point out that the average value of the capillary pressure is less negative than in the prior cases indicating a weakening of the capillary suction contribution it can also be seen that oscillations in the pressure with greater magnitude occur which may be due to the greater forces required to overcome the surface tension resistance for invasion of the larger pores this trend is continued in c where the capillary pressure is now positive on average denoting a capillary action acting against the flow the magnitudes of the oscillations are still present and indeed in this case the values of the capillary pressure are more similar which clearly shows the role of the pore scale velocity on determining the capillary pressure rather than the hydrostatic pressure the cases with lower values of Ï exhibit the behavior of a valve like barrier on the flow as defined by positive values of capillary pressure this positive capillary pressure has been found to appear in cases with higher injected fluid velocity as firstly described by weitz et al 1987 weitz et al showed that dynamic capillary pressure is dependent upon this injected fluid velocity this effect has also been observed in cases where a non wetting fluid is displacing a more dense wetting fluid under gravitational forces lÃ¸voll et al 2011 in the cases investigated herein a more dense fluid is invading a less dense one in such a case we observe a similar general dynamic trend of the capillary pressure whereby increasing the pore scale gravitational effects ca c we notice an increase of the capillary pressure we also observe a marked effect of the packing ratio determining the porous microstructure this observation tells us that it is possible to regulate the capillary pressure by modifying the particle packing as a means to regulate the flow behavior within the system in order to get a better idea of the interdependence of the velocity capillary pressure saturation and microstructure we attempt to collapse all cases onto a single curve fig 5 displays the time averaged capillary pressure as a function of the characteristic capillary number the average for the capillary pressure is calculated as shown 16 p c 1 t end t 0 t 0 t end p c t d t the time averaging neglects the first time instance wherein the infiltration rate constitute outlier values due to initialization of the infiltrating liquid thus t 0 represents the second saved iteration and t t end represents an iteration whereat the effective capillary number becomes smaller than a given threshold value that indicates negligible infiltration here set at ca eff 10 4 in fig 5 the results have been plotted and are clustered by packing ratio the points show an excellent correlation between the time averaged capillary pressure and ca c across the threshold from negative to positive values of capillary pressure a similar relationship is shown for instance in weitz et al however in that work the dynamic contribution to capillary pressure is related to velocity by the equation 17 p c Î² 1 kn ca x 18 n ca Î¼ u Î³ where Î² d r th is the ratio of particle diameter d to r th with r th some characteristic pore throat radius n ca is the capillary number and k x are fitting parameters representing the strength of the dynamic contribution dependent upon initial velocity we choose to use the characteristic capillary number rather than the weitz definition as they controlled the entry velocities whereas in our case the medium velocities are determined by the competition between gravitational and surface tension forces acting at the pore scale thus the dynamic contribution to capillary forces formulated though ca c is expected to depend on the pore size as predicted by eqs 2 and 3 with larger pores inducing a larger dynamic effect on the pore scale pressure distribution despite the differences in the investigated physical system we see a striking similarity in the results when we apply a least squares fit of our collapsed data points to the modified equation of weitz et al as shown in fig 5 it is worth pointing out as well that the results reported in their work were taken at equilibrium conditions whereas in our work we use a time averaged capillary pressure but the relationship still holds the cases with the highest Ï value exhibit a lower capillary pressure and the values scale directly as we decrease Ï they range from capillary suction dominated to more neutral in terms of the driving force for infiltration the clustering remains similar for Ï 10 1 and Ï 6 7 however the capillary pressure is shifted more in the positive direction denoting decreasing influence of capillary suction driven infiltration weitz reported values of Î² 4 1 0 4 whereas in our worth the value is 2 7 which is very similar the same holds true for k 30 5 versus 5 in this work and finally x 0 5 0 1 this close agreement shows the physical consistency of our results with experimental work as well as a method by which the capillary forces can be predicted as a function of the characteristic capillary number it should also be noted here that capillary pressure is determined by the characteristic capillary number and not on the hydrostatic effects represented by h ultimately by modifying the packing ratio we can alter the capillary pressure by way of increasing the pore sizes resultant by choosing larger particles this observation can be invaluable from a design perspective to aid in understanding the behavior of capillary pressure of different substrates under a variety of chosen conditions prior to extensive testing 3 1 modeling infiltration with dynamic capillary pressure we make use of the washburn equation washburn 1921 to aid in elucidating the link between the behavior of the effective capillary number the capillary pressure and the weitz fit as shown in fig 5 we can thus formulate the following proportionality 19 d sat d t h d 2 Î¼ w 1 sath Ï w g h sath p c where the first term within brackets on the right hand side represents the contribution of gravity induced forces and the second term on the right hand side the capillary action this proportionality is consistent with the well known washburn relation of infiltration length in our case saturation proportional to the square root of time if the gravitational component is neglected and the capillary pressure is constant as in the classical definition as a result of this formulation we express the effective capillary number introduced earlier in a similar manner 20 ca eff ca c h sat Ï sat Ï p c sat Ï we see an inverse relationship between the effective capillary number and saturation occurs when either the gravity induced forces are absent ca c 0 or the infiltration is low low value of sat this relationship can be seen in fig 3 as we have a sufficiently low infiltration for this proportionality to occur this also explains why we see faster infiltration in the beginning of the simulations particularly as the packing ratio is decreased in magnitude in addition as saturation increases we expect to see a decrease in effective capillary number which again is visible in fig 3 in all cases from eq 20 we also see that when the value of the packing ratio Ï is low large pores compared to medium thickness the contribution of the first term on the right hand side of eq 20 to the infiltration dynamics i e the gravitational term is increased however as our analysis on the effective capillary pressure reveals see fig 5 low packing ratios likely trigger positive values of capillary pressures which in turn counteract the gravitational contribution in other words low packing ratios and large particles induces significant gravitational forces high ca c which determine a faster initial infiltration rapidly slowed down by a dynamic capillary force acting adversely to the flow 3 2 comparison of dynamic capillary contribution in order to compare these results concerning the behavior of the dynamic capillary pressure we compare our results to that of other researchers several such models can be found in manthey et al 2005 and results of many efforts have been reported in joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 the comparison can be done by way of plotting the changes in saturation against the capillary pressure as given by 21 p c 1 Ï p 0 d sat d t in fig 6 we plot the change in saturation infiltration rate against the capillary pressure the results give an approximation of the dynamic capillary pressure coefficient Ï the infiltration rate is non dimensionalized using the characteristic viscous time t v d 2 Î½ w we can see clearly we have a quasi linear dependence indicative of a constant value for tau for high values of infiltration it is clear however that the model does not work for low infiltration rates and low values of Ï where this quasi linear dependence is lost 3 3 infiltration homoegeneity in fig 7 we plot the probability distribution functions pdfs of infiltration depth at timestep t lb 250 000 and examine the resultant distributions in these cases homogeneous infiltration is characterized by a singular spike near 0 whereas less homogeneous flow is shown by bimodal behavior as well as less extreme slopes in a we see two of the three cases exhibit a tighter distribution around the mean infiltration depth denoting a more homogeneous wetting front however the case with higher hydraulic pressure exhibits less homogeneity in both b and c we see similarly less homogeneous infiltration patterns with the exception of the case where h 15 ca c 0 167 where once again the infiltration appears more homogeneous this aberration in the results can be explained by the quick convergence of this case to an equilibrium state due to the high hydraulic pressure applied the general observed trend suggests that when increasing the hydraulic pressure and reducing the packing ratio while the flow exhibits higher infiltration rates the suction mechanism hydrophilicity is inhibited and an adverse capillary pressure arises this pressure induces less homogeneous infiltration patterns in observing this trend of less homogeneous flow for lower Ï values we have shown that by applying an initial hydrostatic pressure above a certain threshold to the system we can increase the dynamic capillary pressure as defined in this work and generate the conditions under which the porous medium acts in a hydrophobic manner slowing the resultant wetting phase velocity within the pores this lower velocity generates higher occurrences of fingering which is consistent with the works of weitz et al 1987 and cueto felgueroso and juanes 2008 thus by choosing a particular packing ratio one can effectively determine the infiltration rate of the system by bringing about the conditions wherein an inherently hydrophilic or borderline material can act in a hydrophobic manner this particular property can be of use in designing green roof soil substrates where a particle size can be chosen with a specific hydraulic load to behave in a hydrophobic manner and slow pore infiltration by layering differently sized particle one can create a system that acts differently under different hydraulic loads without resorting to overly thick individual layers this can reduce material use and weight applied to the structure depending on the material chosen 4 conclusion this work provides an analysis of the impact of the porous microstructure on infiltration dynamics of thin porous media by establishing the relationships between saturation dynamic capillary pressure effective capillary number and characteristic capillary number the infiltration rate of media with a larger packing ratio is largely unaffected by the magnitude of hydraulic pressure whereas in for lower values of the packing ratio the hydraulic pressure plays a more significant role this is due to the fact that dynamic effects and gravitational forces at the pore scales larger ca c become important an inverse relationship between the effective capillary number and saturation occurs when either the gravity induced forces are absent or the infiltration is low as is seen in this work we see that the capillary pressure depends only upon ca c and as the packing ratio decreases capillary suction is no longer the dominant driver of infiltration and in the most extreme cases the capillarity acts against the infiltration gradient in a valve like manner the relationship between the characteristic capillary number and time averaged capillary pressure is collapsed onto a singular plot and fit to an empirical function derived from experimental work this model allows us to represent the effects of the microstructure and the resulting infiltration rate on the capillary pressure present within the medium by combining the classic washburn solution for infiltration with the power law scaling of the capillary pressure we show that is possible to predict the infiltration within different substrates microstructures under different rain intensity events this can be invaluable from a design perspective to understand the behavior of capillary pressure of different substrates under a variety of chosen flow rates prior to extensive testing a comparison is made to the works of other researches with regard to the contribution of the dynamic component of the capillary pressure with good agreement observed indicating the validity of the method proposed in this work to capture this effect accurately in addition flow homogeneity is dependent upon the capillary pressure which when acting against the infiltrating wetting phase contributes to fingering of the flow within the porous matrix while the results in this work are consistent with the findings of other researchers it should be noted that several assumptions have been made in the work the fixed equilibrium contact angle the lack of any thermal contribution the use idealized packed spherical beds and the omission of drainage within the work these aspects should be addressed in order for future works to approach a more realistic case and thus represent opportunities for future investigation credit authorship

for computing snic at hpc2n partially funded by the swedish research council through grant agreement no 2018 05973 appendix a the capillary pressure is calculated for every time step in the manner described here each interface within the medium is determined and the pressure on each side is calculated as an average value within a specified number of nodes of the interface due to the diffuse nature of the interface of this lattice boltzmann approach a threshold value is chosen to determine which nodes are assigned as the liquid and wetting phase all of the calculated capillary pressures at all interfaces are stored for each iteration along with their locations and a statistical analysis is undertaken for each timestep resulting in a mean and standard error value for the capillary pressure in fig 8 an example interface is shown and the density profile across it is plotted an examination of the standard errors of the capillary pressures at each timestep was undertaken and were neglected from fig 4 on the basis of their magnitude in order to improve figure clarity appendix b a quantification of the dynamic component of the capillary pressure in terms of a coefficient that other researches have used to isolate this contribution is attempted while a direct comparison is difficult as our cases are run fully in a dynamic environment and thus an equilibrium capillary pressure is not calculable we have opted to approximate this coefficient as defined by kalaydjian 1987 whose model is strictly only valid for cylindrical pores the formulation is given as 22 p c 2 r Î³ Ï k sat t where r is the pore throat radius and Ï k is the fitting parameter representing the strength of the dynamic contribution we note here that a range of values for r were tested by calculating the left hand side as the capillary pressure we plot the evolution of Ï k as a function of saturation in fig 9 if one compares to results reported in joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 with m 1 and Ï k sat 0 we capture the dynamic capillary pressure contribution to the flow and how it increases as higher levels of saturation are reached while other researchers have reported the value of Ï to be exclusively positive we see here that its value is negative in several cases wherein r 5 is taken as an average pore throat though a range of values were tested it is very important to stress here that the mathematical models using the damping term require that Ï k 0 for the existence of a solution as outlined in mikelic 2010 koch et al 2013 and cao and pop 2016 some of our results do not conform with this restriction as we have here provided only a single rough estimate of the equilibrium capillary pressure indeed if we reduce the average pore throat radius we eliminate any negative values for Ï k rather than focus solely on the value of Ï k we would stress more its evolution in time which appears to be quasi linear particularly at lower values of saturation which again matches results reported by others though its value oscillates wildly when higher saturation values are reached 
4116,we use the water level data from multiple satellite altimeter missions to estimate discharge at different reaches of varying channel width 130 m to 2 km of the ganga river in india we have established five kachla bridge kanpur shahzadpur prayagraj and mirzapur virtual stations in the middle and two azmabad and farakka in the lower reaches of the ganga river for these stations we acquired the water level from different satellite altimeter mission ers 2 1995 2007 envisat 2002 2010 and jason 2 2008 2017 from publicly available databases we applied datum and offset corrections on the altimeter data to make them comparable with the water level measured at the nearest gauge station at each location water level from the altimeter and gauge station show a good agreement with root mean square rms error in a range between 22 71 cm we plot the altimeter water level as a function of their corresponding discharge measured at the nearest gauge station to establish a stage discharge rating curve for each location we then use these rating curves to estimate monthly discharge of the ganga river from the altimeter water level based on the overall performance analysis of the statistical parameters i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 86 0 98 rms observations standard deviation ratio rsr 0 15 0 38 percent bias pbias 13 27 and the coefficient of determination r 2 0 87 0 98 we show that the estimated discharge from altimeter water level accord well with the in situ discharge measured at the gauge station according to the moriasi guideline our estimate of discharge at all the virtual stations except kanpur can be categorised between good to satisfactory keywords satellite altimeter ganga river stage discharge rating curve 1 introduction terrestrial runoff of rivers is an important component in the global water balance it is an important source of fresh water for humans and the ecosystem measurement of river discharge is essential to understand the flood hazards sediment transport fluvial processes and terrestrial water budget despite its importance yet discharge is not available for many rivers especially those are located in poor and developing countries alsdorf et al 2007 mersel et al 2013 in the indian subcontinent the himalayan foreland basins are drained by several large rivers i e ganga yamuna brahmaputra gandak kosi and characterized by large catchment size length and large volume of water and sediment discharge hovius 1998 tandon and sinha 2007 these rivers constitute about 63 of the total annual flow and about 50 of the total utilizable flow this underlines their importance in freshwater supply for the country it is important to note that the discharge of many of the himalayan rivers is measured at sparsely distributed networks along their course for example the ganga river flows about 2100 km from the himalayan foothills in the upstream to the farakka in the downstream presently discharge is recorded at only 95 manual 71 telemetry 24 gauge stations installed at different locations along the ganga river in india https indiawris gov in wris this hinders our ability to quantify discharge at any location between two or more sparsely distant gauge stations under such conditions often discharge in between any two or more measurement stations is estimated by interpolation smith and pavelsky 2008 lin et al 2019 generally discharge is measured at specific gauge stations installed at fixed locations along a river such stations are locally calibrated to predict discharge as a function of change in water level or stage the calibration of a specific gauging station is derived from repeated measurements of the water surface level and the corresponding water discharge these measurements are performed throughout the hydrologic cycle to ensure that the calibration is valid during all flow periods the river water level is then plotted as a function of the corresponding discharge based on a regression analysis a best fit curve is established that relates water level to the discharge rantz 1982 herschy 1993 such a curve is universally known as stage discharge rating curve and expressed as 1 q a z e m where the coefficients a and m are constants specific to the channel cross section surveyed e is the elevation of zero flow z is the stage and q is the discharge the term z e is often interpreted as equivalent to the mean river flow depth h once a stage discharge relationship is established the discharge can be inferred from the measurements of the water level at any given gauging station recently a decline in the historical gauge network is reported worldwide due to their high operational and maintenance costs shiklomanov et al 2002 vÃ¶rÃ¶smarty 2002 fekete and vÃ¶rÃ¶smarty 2007 and tourian et al 2013 compiled a time series plot of the in situ gauge stations from world meteorological organization wmo https public wmo int en and publicly available global runoff data centre grdc https www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html data that indicates a significant decline of gauge stations worldwide from 1980 to 2010 this has resulted in the discontinuity of discharge measurement for various rivers globally such a gap is a real challenge for many scientific analyses sichangi et al 2016 to overcome this problem researchers proposed to use remote sensing as an alternative to estimate water discharge smith et al 1995 smith et al 1996 smith 1997 alsdorf et al 2007 ashmore and sauks 2006 marcus and fonstad 2008 gleason and smith 2014 sulistioadi et al 2015 biancamaria et al 2017 bogning et al 2018 gaurav et al 2021 these studies rely on the establishment of rating relationships between some image derived parameters such as channel width water level stage to the in situ discharge measured at the ground stations radar altimeter is an active microwave instrument that measures the surface elevation of an object over a fixed datum altimeters were originally designed to monitor changes in ocean water level and ice sheets from space birkett 1998 alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 felikson et al 2017 stammer and cazenave 2017 passaro et al 2018 later researchers explored its potential to measure the fluctuation of water level in large rivers altimeters record the reflected echoes from the object by transmitting a high frequency signal to the nadir calmant et al 2008 the range is then estimated by the travel time of the signal between the altimeter and surface the water level is calculated by subtracting satellite to surface range from a reference datum taking into account the various errors water level to a common datum can be estimated according to 2 h h r e where h is the water level h is the satellite altitude r is the nadir altimeter range and e is the propagated time delays due to atmospheric and geographic errors from the last two decades satellite altimeter has become an important tool to remotely monitor the water levels and discharge in large rivers width of few kilometers for example koblinsky et al 1993 used geosat altimeter data to measure the change of water level in the amazon river basin with a vertical accuracy of the order of 0 7 m similarly birkett 1998 and birkett et al 2002 used topex poseidon t p altimeter to track water level in the amazon basin the okavango river the indus river and the congo river with the accuracy ranging from 11 to 60 cm further birkett et al 2002 used the river stage from t p data to calibrate discharge rating curves at many locations in the amazon basin similarly kouraev et al 2004 estimated the daily discharge of the ob river in the arctic coe and birkett 2004 used t p altimeter to estimate a monthly average discharge of the chari river at n djamena chad later papa et al 2010 used t p ers 2 and envisat data to track water level at the mouth of the ganga and brahmaputra rivers in bangladesh using these measurements and calibrated stage discharge rating curves they estimated the monthly average discharge time series for both rivers from 1993 2008 they found a mean error of the order of about 15 for the brahmaputra and about 36 for the ganga using t p and ers 2 data respectively in another study papa et al 2012 used jason 2 radar altimeter measurements to estimate water discharge in the ganga and the brahmaputra rivers they found that the jason 2 radar altimeter could detect water level fluctuations in the ganga and the brahmaputra rivers within 4 of the ground measured stage they also estimated monthly average discharge for the years 2008 2011 and found that the jason 2 radar altimeter measurements could be used to infer the discharge with the uncertainty ranging from 6 5 to 13 dubey et al 2015 used jason 2 altimeter data to estimate the discharge of the brahmaputra river near guwahati assam in india they found a good correlation r 2 0 94 between the estimated and measured discharge at the gauge station schrÃ¶der et al 2019 have used envisat and saral altika to simulate water discharge of the niger river huang et al 2020 used water level from jason 2 satellite mission to estimate discharge of the major rivers mekong brahamputra and salween in the tibetan plateau recently bogning et al 2020 used envisat and jason 2 altimeter data to estimate discharge in the poorly gauged ogoouÃ© river basin in central africa most of the studies discussed above are applied to the large rivers having the channels width of few kilometers only a few studies are available that use satellite altimeter data to estimate discharge in relatively narrow width 1 km rivers tourian et al 2013 sulistioadi et al 2015 zakharova et al 2020 this study uses publicly available water level data from multiple satellite altimeter missions ers 2 envisat and jason 2 to estimate discharge of the ganga river at seven different locations from kachla bridge in the upstream to farakka in the downstream we have selected five locations kachla bridge kanpur shahzadpur prayagraj and mirzapur in the middle and two azmabad and farakka in the lower reaches of the ganga river the channel width of the ganga river in the middle and lower reaches vary between 150 to 700 m and 0 85 2 km respectively the main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of multi mission satellite altimeter data to estimate monthly average discharge at different reaches of varying width along the ganga river in doing so we first apply the datum and offset corrections on the altimeter water level for all the stations and compared them with the water level measured at the nearest gauge station for each virtual station we plot the altimeter water level against the corresponding discharge measured at the gauge station to establish a stage discharge rating curve finally we use these rating curves to estimate the average monthly discharge at each virtual station from the altimeter water level this study could be a useful tool for a quick assessment of discharge for monitoring river health flood management and many other applications it may be used to construct supplementary data to fill the gap in discharge time series in case of missing data values at the gauge stations 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset this study uses stage and water discharge measured at different gauge stations along the ganga river and water level recorded from satellite altimeters we obtained stage and corresponding discharge data from the central water commissionhttp cwc gov in cwc new delhi for seven different gauge locations 4 15 years five from the middle and two from the lower reaches of the ganga river fig 1 table 1 the reference datum for cwc gauging stations is the mean sea level msl our in situ archive consists of average of every ten days measurements of stage and discharge at the gauge stations we have aggregated them to obtain the monthly average quantity at or near the in situ gauge stations we obtained the water level recorded from different satellite altimeters table 2 hereafter we refer to these altimeter locations as virtual stations along the ganga river we used two different open archive sources hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr dahiti https dahiti dgfi tum de en map to download the altimeter dataset the accuracy of altimeter data from both these databases are in cm to mm level schwatke et al 2015 dubey et al 2015 hydroweb delineates the virtual station at high frequency 18 20 hz in a rectangular window da silva et al 2010 it has four different satellite altimeter datasets envisat jason 2 sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b for the ganga river basin all these datasets come with preliminary corrections such as orbital ionosphere troposphere polar and sea bias dubey et al 2015 dahiti is a multi mission altimetry archive that is similar to hydroweb except it uses the kalman filter for rejecting the outlier in the measurement schwatke et al 2015 for our purpose we have used the ers 2 1995 2007 envisat 2002 2010 and jason 2 2008 2017 satellite altimeter data table 2 reports the detailed specification of the altimeter dataset 2 2 processing of altimeter data altimeter data obtained from the open source databases are presumed to be accurate schwatke et al 2015 dubey et al 2015 however there are a few errors that still exist in the database for example hydroweb uses egm2008 geoid which does not fit correctly for inland water crÃ©taux et al 2011 it may lead to uncertainty in the water level gauged from the satellite altimeter to assess the accuracy of water level derived from the satellite altimeter we compare them with the corresponding in situ measurement at the gauge station to minimise this difference we further process the altimeter data as discussed in the following subsections 2 2 1 orthometric correction the altimeters provide water level in egm2008 geoid model whereas cwc uses mean sea level to measure water level at the gauge stations hence to compare the in situ and altimeter measurements we need to bring them into a common datum to do this we have taken the datum height of gauge stations in egm2008 geoid model we then transfer the reference height of the altimeter at the virtual stations with respect to their nearby gauge data for example the egm2008 reference value at farakka station and nearby virtual station vs 7 is 56 80 and 55 89 respectively the height difference is 0 91 this difference we add in vs 7 in general the reference height of altimeter water level is h egm 2008 and Î´ h is the difference between gauge station and altimeter datum the height h is the reference height of the altimeter to the observed stage datum and it can be calculated according to 3 h h egm 2008 Î´ h using eq 3 we have corrected water level at the virtual stations table 3 reports the height difference between the gauge and virtual stations due to the datum differences 2 2 2 offset measurement even after the datum corrections sometimes water level obtained from the satellite altimeters is not comparable to the measurement at the corresponding gauge stations this discrepancy is not uniform throughout it changes with the seasonal variability this is probably due to the fact that the location of gauge stations and virtual stations do not coincide in our case gauge and virtual stations are separated by the vertical distance ranging from 0 3 m to 1 m we added an offset value z in the water level to minimize this gap for all virtual stations this value can be obtained by computing the median of the error between the gauge and virtual station assuming virtual and gauge height at a given time t is h t and h o t respectively then the offset value z for the virtual station at a concurrent time can be computed according to 4 z median h 0 t h t i n the corrected value of water level h at the virtual station is 5 h t h i t z where i is the continuous variable for different time instances which ranges from i 1 2 3 n the offset value is then added to all the altimeter water levels to make them comparable to the river stage measured at the in situ gauge station offset values for our virtual stations are listed in table 3 2 2 3 rejection of inaccurate points water level at the virtual stations still has some random values these are topography errors that occur due to strong echoes return from the off nadir view for example during the winter season in july 2017 at shahzadpur the monthly average gauge height is 86 01 m and the corrected altimeter height is 87 08 m this makes a difference of 1 07 m to the height measured at the gauge station to remove erroneous points from the virtual stations we have performed one sample student t test at 99 confidence limits on the altimeter derived water level birkinshaw et al 2010 we set the upper and lower limit of t test of the altimeter data we reject the data points that do not fall within the limit of the t test fig 2 illustrates the procedure of the rejection of invalid data points 2 3 development of rating curves we have used altimeter water level and corresponding discharge measured at the nearest gauge station to develop stage discharge rating curves at the virtual stations we split the data into two groups one to construct the rating curves and the other for validation purpose first we construct the rating curve for each virtual station separately using the full length of the available records from the dataset the resulting empirical curves suggest water levels follow a power law scaling relation to the discharge further to evaluate the statistical significance of the coefficients of rating curves we artificially produce smaller datasets by bootstrapping and fit a power law on them in doing so we set 10000 iterations and at every iteration randomly replace 50 of the data points from the dataset used to develop the rating curves we observed bootstrap does not result in any significant difference in the rating curve parameters for all the virtual stations the change in the mean value of slope and intercept are less than 7 and 1 respectively this gives us confidence that 50 of our data can be used to develop rating curves and the remaining 50 for the validation purpose 2 4 calibration of rating curves before using our rating curve equations to estimate discharge we need to calibrate them for the strong seasonal variation in the study area we have calculated the calibration function by median regression technique between the measured and test discharge of 50 rating curve data bjerklie et al 2005 birkinshaw et al 2010 this is a robust process and not affected by residual errors the result of the correction factor is then multiplied to the rating curve according to eq 6 6 q i m q i p Î² 0 5 e i where q i m is the corrected discharge q i p is the predicted discharge from the rating curve Î² is the correction factor and e i is model predicted errors 3 result 3 1 accuracy of the altimeter data we plot the water level at the virtual station against the stage recorded at the corresponding gauge station figs 3 and 4 we observed for all our stations the water levels at the virtual and gauge stations are highly correlated their correlation of determination vary in a range between r 2 0 90 0 98 with the root mean square error rmse from 0 22 m to 0 64 m we noticed a relatively high rmse 0 64 m for the virtual station at farakka in the lower ganga plain this appears to be associated with the large distance 81 km between the virtual and corresponding gauge stations after applying the corrections on altimeter data we observed the accuracy of water level at the virtual stations has improved significantly in the middle ganga initially the rmse on the regression between the water level at the virtual and the corresponding gauge station is in a range between 0 33 to 1 30 m after corrections the rmse at the virtual stations has reduced in a range between 0 22 to 0 44 m similarly in the lower ganga rmse has improved from 0 77 1 3 m to 0 41 0 64 m for the virtual stations near azmabad and farakka respectively 3 2 stage discharge rating curves at each virtual station we used 50 of the data to establish rating curves and remaining data for the validation we do this by selecting the altimeter water level and the corresponding discharge at every alternate month i e jan march may etc from the database we now plot the monthly average water level against their corresponding monthly average discharge at the nearest gauge station we observed water level increases non linearly with the discharge this can be modeled by a power law curve fig 5 and 6 to obtain the coefficients of the best fit curve of our data points we have performed a reduced major axis rma analysis at 95 confidence limits rma assumes error in both the response and predictor variables and computes the best estimate of slope and intercept of the rating curve sokal and rohlf 1981 gaurav et al 2017 table 4 reports the rating curve parameters of the virtual stations obtained from the rma analysis the rating curves are generated with the assumption that for a shorter distance the variability in discharge between the gauge and virtual station will be less practically at a gauge station more than one rating curve can be established corresponding to the different hydrologic regimes kouraev et al 2004 since we have established one rating curve at each gauge station we can expect the effect of inter seasonal variation this variation is more prominent at the stations where discharge is very low in our case discharge in the non monsoon period is very low 1000 m 3 s 1 and increases drastically during the monsoon period 3000 20 000 m 3 s 1 in the middle reaches of the ganga river in contrast this difference is relatively less at the downstream gauging stations azmabad and farakka of the ganga river 3 3 measured vs predicted discharge our estimated discharge at the virtual station compares with the monthly discharge measured at the corresponding ground station figs 7 and 8 show the time series of estimated and measured discharge at the virtual stations in the middle and lower reaches of the ganga river a qualitative assessment of the discharge hydrographs reveals a closer agreement between the measured and predicted discharge however there are a few instances when the predicted and measured discharge do not compare for example at the virtual station near kanpur the difference between measured and predicted discharge in september 2008 is about 4161 m 3 s 1 such differences are rare in our record and do not show any temporal correlation further we compare the average monthly discharge of the virtual and ground stations we computed the uncertainties in the measured discharge at the ground station along with their mean values we have removed simulated discharge values that are over predicted to compute the monthly average discharge at the virtual station we considered the months for which at least altimeter data is available on two different dates usually a difference of about 15 20 between the measured and simulated discharge is acceptable in the scientific community however this limit is not valid in the narrow rivers calmant et al 2008 the width of our rivers is less than 1 km table 2 we expect a bit higher uncertainty in the simulated discharge as compared to the permissible range table 5 reports the error between the discharge estimated at the virtual and measured at the corresponding gauge station in the non monsoon period the ganga river flows at shallow depth in the middle reaches kachla bridge and kanpur this is reflected in the discharge time series of these stations for example during the non monsoon period the average monthly discharge of the ganga river at kachla bridge is below 200 m 3 s 1 the shallow flow depth of the ganga river in the middle reaches results in high uncertainty in the measurement of water level from satellite altimeter and eventually in discharge we observed the simulated discharge in the lower ganga river accord well 25 with the measured discharge we have also performed the sensitivity analysis of our result in doing so we assumed 10 cm error in altimeter water level this results in about less than 10 difference in mean annual discharge of all virtual stations to their initial estimates except for the kachla bridge and kanpur during the non monsoon period the difference in average monthly discharge is less than 10 for all months the difference in average monthly discharge at kachla bridge and kanpur in the non monsoon period is about 15 4 discussion to evaluate the performance of virtual stations we calculate nash sutcliffe efficiency nse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and pbias nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 1999 moriasi et al 2007 nse is used to quantify the magnitude of relative variance with measured discharge the rsr for the error index and pbias for the average bias in the simulated values figs 7 and 8 show a comparison between the observed and estimated discharge we followed the performance rating to evaluate the result obtained for each of the virtual stations moriasi et al 2007 the estimated discharge is considered satisfactory if nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 and pbias 25 table 6 reports the quantitative statistics of the predicted discharge at each of the virtual stations based on these indices we report the performance of our rating curves to estimate discharge at the virtual stations table 6 we observed estimated discharge at the virtual stations compare well with the average monthly discharge measured at the gauge station the correlation of determination r 2 between the estimated and measured discharge is in range between 0 87 0 98 nse 0 84 0 98 and rsr 0 15 to 0 38 according to moriasi et al 2007 the values of our indices can be considered satisfactory we observed pbias in range 13 27 based on this value we can qualitatively categorise the estimated discharge at the virtual stations as satisfactory and unsatisfactory for any model it is important to estimate the associated uncertainty in the result to assess the uncertainty we have considered nse rsr and pbias indices in the lower ganga reaches the estimated discharge accord well with the measured discharge at the nearest gauge station for example estimated discharge near azmabad nse 0 98 rsr 0 15 pbias 13 and r 2 0 98 and farakka nse 0 96 rsr 0 21 pbias 17 and r 2 0 96 are highly correlated with the discharge measured at the nearest gauge station in contrast virtual stations kachla bridge kanpur shahzadpur mirzapur in the middle ganga relatively exhibit a large uncertainty in the estimated discharge this is probably associated with the relatively less discharge in the middle reaches of the ganga river as compared to the lower reaches another source of uncertainty in the estimated discharge is due to the temporal resolution of the satellite altimeter we have used data from different satellite altimeter missions to estimate the monthly discharge at the virtual stations compilation of water level data from multiple altimeter satellites can provide a repeat measurement at higher frequency some altimeter missions provide more than one repetitive measurement of the stage in a month whereas other provide just one measurement the repetitive altimeter data of a given month is averaged to get the monthly estimate of the water level whereas if a satellite altimeter has just one pass that water level has been considered a representative value for that month this irregular sampling may result in a discrepancy between the estimated discharge and average monthly discharge at the ground station especially during the peak flow we observed that the discharge estimated from the satellite altimeter having a single pass in a given month results in a large difference from the measured discharge at the gauge station according to papa et al 2010 the estimated discharge of the ganga brahmaputra river should not exceed or below more than 20 from gauge discharge using 35 days sampling resolution in our case 80 90 discharge residual errors are under the range of 20 we notice estimated discharge at the virtual stations is relatively high at the locations where flow of the ganga river is relatively less the uncertainty in the simulated discharge is also due to the proper calibration of the water level between the gauge and virtual stations in rivers it has been observed that the accuracy of water level obtained from publicly available satellite altimeter data varies in a range between 10 cm to 100 cm dubey et al 2015 schwatke et al 2015 whereas the central water commission cwc new delhi reports the water level for the indian rivers within an accuracy of 5 mm this difference in the accuracy of the water level introduces uncertainty in the final discharge estimated from the satellite altimeter 5 conclusion and future outlook water level derived from satellite altimeter mission can be used to estimate monthly average discharge at different reaches along the ganga river this study relies on empirical stage discharge relationship between the water level obtained from the satellite altimeter to the discharge measured at the nearest gauge station our rating curves provide an accurate estimate of discharge at the lower reaches azmabad and farakka of the ganga river this is probably associated with the deeper flow wider channel and high discharge regime table 5 in the lower ganga similarly in the middle ganga shallow flow and low discharge table 5 results in relatively high uncertainty in the estimated discharge based on the statistical evaluation for all our virtual stations the estimated monthly average discharge fall in the range between good to satisfactory this study is a step towards estimating discharge in the ungauged river basins from satellite altimeter data though we applied our methodology only on alluvial reaches of the ganga river it can be extended to other alluvial and bedrock rivers of different geological and climatic regimes if the ground measurement of discharge is accessible at present our methodology requires at least one gauge station in the proximity of altimeter track to establish a stage discharge rating curve in the absence of gauge discharge establishing such a curve will be challenging the upcoming swot mission is expected to fill this gap in estimating discharge in ungauged river basins solely from satellite data credit authorship contribution statement atul kumar rai conceptualization

4116,we use the water level data from multiple satellite altimeter missions to estimate discharge at different reaches of varying channel width 130 m to 2 km of the ganga river in india we have established five kachla bridge kanpur shahzadpur prayagraj and mirzapur virtual stations in the middle and two azmabad and farakka in the lower reaches of the ganga river for these stations we acquired the water level from different satellite altimeter mission ers 2 1995 2007 envisat 2002 2010 and jason 2 2008 2017 from publicly available databases we applied datum and offset corrections on the altimeter data to make them comparable with the water level measured at the nearest gauge station at each location water level from the altimeter and gauge station show a good agreement with root mean square rms error in a range between 22 71 cm we plot the altimeter water level as a function of their corresponding discharge measured at the nearest gauge station to establish a stage discharge rating curve for each location we then use these rating curves to estimate monthly discharge of the ganga river from the altimeter water level based on the overall performance analysis of the statistical parameters i e nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 86 0 98 rms observations standard deviation ratio rsr 0 15 0 38 percent bias pbias 13 27 and the coefficient of determination r 2 0 87 0 98 we show that the estimated discharge from altimeter water level accord well with the in situ discharge measured at the gauge station according to the moriasi guideline our estimate of discharge at all the virtual stations except kanpur can be categorised between good to satisfactory keywords satellite altimeter ganga river stage discharge rating curve 1 introduction terrestrial runoff of rivers is an important component in the global water balance it is an important source of fresh water for humans and the ecosystem measurement of river discharge is essential to understand the flood hazards sediment transport fluvial processes and terrestrial water budget despite its importance yet discharge is not available for many rivers especially those are located in poor and developing countries alsdorf et al 2007 mersel et al 2013 in the indian subcontinent the himalayan foreland basins are drained by several large rivers i e ganga yamuna brahmaputra gandak kosi and characterized by large catchment size length and large volume of water and sediment discharge hovius 1998 tandon and sinha 2007 these rivers constitute about 63 of the total annual flow and about 50 of the total utilizable flow this underlines their importance in freshwater supply for the country it is important to note that the discharge of many of the himalayan rivers is measured at sparsely distributed networks along their course for example the ganga river flows about 2100 km from the himalayan foothills in the upstream to the farakka in the downstream presently discharge is recorded at only 95 manual 71 telemetry 24 gauge stations installed at different locations along the ganga river in india https indiawris gov in wris this hinders our ability to quantify discharge at any location between two or more sparsely distant gauge stations under such conditions often discharge in between any two or more measurement stations is estimated by interpolation smith and pavelsky 2008 lin et al 2019 generally discharge is measured at specific gauge stations installed at fixed locations along a river such stations are locally calibrated to predict discharge as a function of change in water level or stage the calibration of a specific gauging station is derived from repeated measurements of the water surface level and the corresponding water discharge these measurements are performed throughout the hydrologic cycle to ensure that the calibration is valid during all flow periods the river water level is then plotted as a function of the corresponding discharge based on a regression analysis a best fit curve is established that relates water level to the discharge rantz 1982 herschy 1993 such a curve is universally known as stage discharge rating curve and expressed as 1 q a z e m where the coefficients a and m are constants specific to the channel cross section surveyed e is the elevation of zero flow z is the stage and q is the discharge the term z e is often interpreted as equivalent to the mean river flow depth h once a stage discharge relationship is established the discharge can be inferred from the measurements of the water level at any given gauging station recently a decline in the historical gauge network is reported worldwide due to their high operational and maintenance costs shiklomanov et al 2002 vÃ¶rÃ¶smarty 2002 fekete and vÃ¶rÃ¶smarty 2007 and tourian et al 2013 compiled a time series plot of the in situ gauge stations from world meteorological organization wmo https public wmo int en and publicly available global runoff data centre grdc https www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html data that indicates a significant decline of gauge stations worldwide from 1980 to 2010 this has resulted in the discontinuity of discharge measurement for various rivers globally such a gap is a real challenge for many scientific analyses sichangi et al 2016 to overcome this problem researchers proposed to use remote sensing as an alternative to estimate water discharge smith et al 1995 smith et al 1996 smith 1997 alsdorf et al 2007 ashmore and sauks 2006 marcus and fonstad 2008 gleason and smith 2014 sulistioadi et al 2015 biancamaria et al 2017 bogning et al 2018 gaurav et al 2021 these studies rely on the establishment of rating relationships between some image derived parameters such as channel width water level stage to the in situ discharge measured at the ground stations radar altimeter is an active microwave instrument that measures the surface elevation of an object over a fixed datum altimeters were originally designed to monitor changes in ocean water level and ice sheets from space birkett 1998 alsdorf and lettenmaier 2003 felikson et al 2017 stammer and cazenave 2017 passaro et al 2018 later researchers explored its potential to measure the fluctuation of water level in large rivers altimeters record the reflected echoes from the object by transmitting a high frequency signal to the nadir calmant et al 2008 the range is then estimated by the travel time of the signal between the altimeter and surface the water level is calculated by subtracting satellite to surface range from a reference datum taking into account the various errors water level to a common datum can be estimated according to 2 h h r e where h is the water level h is the satellite altitude r is the nadir altimeter range and e is the propagated time delays due to atmospheric and geographic errors from the last two decades satellite altimeter has become an important tool to remotely monitor the water levels and discharge in large rivers width of few kilometers for example koblinsky et al 1993 used geosat altimeter data to measure the change of water level in the amazon river basin with a vertical accuracy of the order of 0 7 m similarly birkett 1998 and birkett et al 2002 used topex poseidon t p altimeter to track water level in the amazon basin the okavango river the indus river and the congo river with the accuracy ranging from 11 to 60 cm further birkett et al 2002 used the river stage from t p data to calibrate discharge rating curves at many locations in the amazon basin similarly kouraev et al 2004 estimated the daily discharge of the ob river in the arctic coe and birkett 2004 used t p altimeter to estimate a monthly average discharge of the chari river at n djamena chad later papa et al 2010 used t p ers 2 and envisat data to track water level at the mouth of the ganga and brahmaputra rivers in bangladesh using these measurements and calibrated stage discharge rating curves they estimated the monthly average discharge time series for both rivers from 1993 2008 they found a mean error of the order of about 15 for the brahmaputra and about 36 for the ganga using t p and ers 2 data respectively in another study papa et al 2012 used jason 2 radar altimeter measurements to estimate water discharge in the ganga and the brahmaputra rivers they found that the jason 2 radar altimeter could detect water level fluctuations in the ganga and the brahmaputra rivers within 4 of the ground measured stage they also estimated monthly average discharge for the years 2008 2011 and found that the jason 2 radar altimeter measurements could be used to infer the discharge with the uncertainty ranging from 6 5 to 13 dubey et al 2015 used jason 2 altimeter data to estimate the discharge of the brahmaputra river near guwahati assam in india they found a good correlation r 2 0 94 between the estimated and measured discharge at the gauge station schrÃ¶der et al 2019 have used envisat and saral altika to simulate water discharge of the niger river huang et al 2020 used water level from jason 2 satellite mission to estimate discharge of the major rivers mekong brahamputra and salween in the tibetan plateau recently bogning et al 2020 used envisat and jason 2 altimeter data to estimate discharge in the poorly gauged ogoouÃ© river basin in central africa most of the studies discussed above are applied to the large rivers having the channels width of few kilometers only a few studies are available that use satellite altimeter data to estimate discharge in relatively narrow width 1 km rivers tourian et al 2013 sulistioadi et al 2015 zakharova et al 2020 this study uses publicly available water level data from multiple satellite altimeter missions ers 2 envisat and jason 2 to estimate discharge of the ganga river at seven different locations from kachla bridge in the upstream to farakka in the downstream we have selected five locations kachla bridge kanpur shahzadpur prayagraj and mirzapur in the middle and two azmabad and farakka in the lower reaches of the ganga river the channel width of the ganga river in the middle and lower reaches vary between 150 to 700 m and 0 85 2 km respectively the main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of multi mission satellite altimeter data to estimate monthly average discharge at different reaches of varying width along the ganga river in doing so we first apply the datum and offset corrections on the altimeter water level for all the stations and compared them with the water level measured at the nearest gauge station for each virtual station we plot the altimeter water level against the corresponding discharge measured at the gauge station to establish a stage discharge rating curve finally we use these rating curves to estimate the average monthly discharge at each virtual station from the altimeter water level this study could be a useful tool for a quick assessment of discharge for monitoring river health flood management and many other applications it may be used to construct supplementary data to fill the gap in discharge time series in case of missing data values at the gauge stations 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset this study uses stage and water discharge measured at different gauge stations along the ganga river and water level recorded from satellite altimeters we obtained stage and corresponding discharge data from the central water commissionhttp cwc gov in cwc new delhi for seven different gauge locations 4 15 years five from the middle and two from the lower reaches of the ganga river fig 1 table 1 the reference datum for cwc gauging stations is the mean sea level msl our in situ archive consists of average of every ten days measurements of stage and discharge at the gauge stations we have aggregated them to obtain the monthly average quantity at or near the in situ gauge stations we obtained the water level recorded from different satellite altimeters table 2 hereafter we refer to these altimeter locations as virtual stations along the ganga river we used two different open archive sources hydroweb http hydroweb theia land fr dahiti https dahiti dgfi tum de en map to download the altimeter dataset the accuracy of altimeter data from both these databases are in cm to mm level schwatke et al 2015 dubey et al 2015 hydroweb delineates the virtual station at high frequency 18 20 hz in a rectangular window da silva et al 2010 it has four different satellite altimeter datasets envisat jason 2 sentinel 3a and sentinel 3b for the ganga river basin all these datasets come with preliminary corrections such as orbital ionosphere troposphere polar and sea bias dubey et al 2015 dahiti is a multi mission altimetry archive that is similar to hydroweb except it uses the kalman filter for rejecting the outlier in the measurement schwatke et al 2015 for our purpose we have used the ers 2 1995 2007 envisat 2002 2010 and jason 2 2008 2017 satellite altimeter data table 2 reports the detailed specification of the altimeter dataset 2 2 processing of altimeter data altimeter data obtained from the open source databases are presumed to be accurate schwatke et al 2015 dubey et al 2015 however there are a few errors that still exist in the database for example hydroweb uses egm2008 geoid which does not fit correctly for inland water crÃ©taux et al 2011 it may lead to uncertainty in the water level gauged from the satellite altimeter to assess the accuracy of water level derived from the satellite altimeter we compare them with the corresponding in situ measurement at the gauge station to minimise this difference we further process the altimeter data as discussed in the following subsections 2 2 1 orthometric correction the altimeters provide water level in egm2008 geoid model whereas cwc uses mean sea level to measure water level at the gauge stations hence to compare the in situ and altimeter measurements we need to bring them into a common datum to do this we have taken the datum height of gauge stations in egm2008 geoid model we then transfer the reference height of the altimeter at the virtual stations with respect to their nearby gauge data for example the egm2008 reference value at farakka station and nearby virtual station vs 7 is 56 80 and 55 89 respectively the height difference is 0 91 this difference we add in vs 7 in general the reference height of altimeter water level is h egm 2008 and Î´ h is the difference between gauge station and altimeter datum the height h is the reference height of the altimeter to the observed stage datum and it can be calculated according to 3 h h egm 2008 Î´ h using eq 3 we have corrected water level at the virtual stations table 3 reports the height difference between the gauge and virtual stations due to the datum differences 2 2 2 offset measurement even after the datum corrections sometimes water level obtained from the satellite altimeters is not comparable to the measurement at the corresponding gauge stations this discrepancy is not uniform throughout it changes with the seasonal variability this is probably due to the fact that the location of gauge stations and virtual stations do not coincide in our case gauge and virtual stations are separated by the vertical distance ranging from 0 3 m to 1 m we added an offset value z in the water level to minimize this gap for all virtual stations this value can be obtained by computing the median of the error between the gauge and virtual station assuming virtual and gauge height at a given time t is h t and h o t respectively then the offset value z for the virtual station at a concurrent time can be computed according to 4 z median h 0 t h t i n the corrected value of water level h at the virtual station is 5 h t h i t z where i is the continuous variable for different time instances which ranges from i 1 2 3 n the offset value is then added to all the altimeter water levels to make them comparable to the river stage measured at the in situ gauge station offset values for our virtual stations are listed in table 3 2 2 3 rejection of inaccurate points water level at the virtual stations still has some random values these are topography errors that occur due to strong echoes return from the off nadir view for example during the winter season in july 2017 at shahzadpur the monthly average gauge height is 86 01 m and the corrected altimeter height is 87 08 m this makes a difference of 1 07 m to the height measured at the gauge station to remove erroneous points from the virtual stations we have performed one sample student t test at 99 confidence limits on the altimeter derived water level birkinshaw et al 2010 we set the upper and lower limit of t test of the altimeter data we reject the data points that do not fall within the limit of the t test fig 2 illustrates the procedure of the rejection of invalid data points 2 3 development of rating curves we have used altimeter water level and corresponding discharge measured at the nearest gauge station to develop stage discharge rating curves at the virtual stations we split the data into two groups one to construct the rating curves and the other for validation purpose first we construct the rating curve for each virtual station separately using the full length of the available records from the dataset the resulting empirical curves suggest water levels follow a power law scaling relation to the discharge further to evaluate the statistical significance of the coefficients of rating curves we artificially produce smaller datasets by bootstrapping and fit a power law on them in doing so we set 10000 iterations and at every iteration randomly replace 50 of the data points from the dataset used to develop the rating curves we observed bootstrap does not result in any significant difference in the rating curve parameters for all the virtual stations the change in the mean value of slope and intercept are less than 7 and 1 respectively this gives us confidence that 50 of our data can be used to develop rating curves and the remaining 50 for the validation purpose 2 4 calibration of rating curves before using our rating curve equations to estimate discharge we need to calibrate them for the strong seasonal variation in the study area we have calculated the calibration function by median regression technique between the measured and test discharge of 50 rating curve data bjerklie et al 2005 birkinshaw et al 2010 this is a robust process and not affected by residual errors the result of the correction factor is then multiplied to the rating curve according to eq 6 6 q i m q i p Î² 0 5 e i where q i m is the corrected discharge q i p is the predicted discharge from the rating curve Î² is the correction factor and e i is model predicted errors 3 result 3 1 accuracy of the altimeter data we plot the water level at the virtual station against the stage recorded at the corresponding gauge station figs 3 and 4 we observed for all our stations the water levels at the virtual and gauge stations are highly correlated their correlation of determination vary in a range between r 2 0 90 0 98 with the root mean square error rmse from 0 22 m to 0 64 m we noticed a relatively high rmse 0 64 m for the virtual station at farakka in the lower ganga plain this appears to be associated with the large distance 81 km between the virtual and corresponding gauge stations after applying the corrections on altimeter data we observed the accuracy of water level at the virtual stations has improved significantly in the middle ganga initially the rmse on the regression between the water level at the virtual and the corresponding gauge station is in a range between 0 33 to 1 30 m after corrections the rmse at the virtual stations has reduced in a range between 0 22 to 0 44 m similarly in the lower ganga rmse has improved from 0 77 1 3 m to 0 41 0 64 m for the virtual stations near azmabad and farakka respectively 3 2 stage discharge rating curves at each virtual station we used 50 of the data to establish rating curves and remaining data for the validation we do this by selecting the altimeter water level and the corresponding discharge at every alternate month i e jan march may etc from the database we now plot the monthly average water level against their corresponding monthly average discharge at the nearest gauge station we observed water level increases non linearly with the discharge this can be modeled by a power law curve fig 5 and 6 to obtain the coefficients of the best fit curve of our data points we have performed a reduced major axis rma analysis at 95 confidence limits rma assumes error in both the response and predictor variables and computes the best estimate of slope and intercept of the rating curve sokal and rohlf 1981 gaurav et al 2017 table 4 reports the rating curve parameters of the virtual stations obtained from the rma analysis the rating curves are generated with the assumption that for a shorter distance the variability in discharge between the gauge and virtual station will be less practically at a gauge station more than one rating curve can be established corresponding to the different hydrologic regimes kouraev et al 2004 since we have established one rating curve at each gauge station we can expect the effect of inter seasonal variation this variation is more prominent at the stations where discharge is very low in our case discharge in the non monsoon period is very low 1000 m 3 s 1 and increases drastically during the monsoon period 3000 20 000 m 3 s 1 in the middle reaches of the ganga river in contrast this difference is relatively less at the downstream gauging stations azmabad and farakka of the ganga river 3 3 measured vs predicted discharge our estimated discharge at the virtual station compares with the monthly discharge measured at the corresponding ground station figs 7 and 8 show the time series of estimated and measured discharge at the virtual stations in the middle and lower reaches of the ganga river a qualitative assessment of the discharge hydrographs reveals a closer agreement between the measured and predicted discharge however there are a few instances when the predicted and measured discharge do not compare for example at the virtual station near kanpur the difference between measured and predicted discharge in september 2008 is about 4161 m 3 s 1 such differences are rare in our record and do not show any temporal correlation further we compare the average monthly discharge of the virtual and ground stations we computed the uncertainties in the measured discharge at the ground station along with their mean values we have removed simulated discharge values that are over predicted to compute the monthly average discharge at the virtual station we considered the months for which at least altimeter data is available on two different dates usually a difference of about 15 20 between the measured and simulated discharge is acceptable in the scientific community however this limit is not valid in the narrow rivers calmant et al 2008 the width of our rivers is less than 1 km table 2 we expect a bit higher uncertainty in the simulated discharge as compared to the permissible range table 5 reports the error between the discharge estimated at the virtual and measured at the corresponding gauge station in the non monsoon period the ganga river flows at shallow depth in the middle reaches kachla bridge and kanpur this is reflected in the discharge time series of these stations for example during the non monsoon period the average monthly discharge of the ganga river at kachla bridge is below 200 m 3 s 1 the shallow flow depth of the ganga river in the middle reaches results in high uncertainty in the measurement of water level from satellite altimeter and eventually in discharge we observed the simulated discharge in the lower ganga river accord well 25 with the measured discharge we have also performed the sensitivity analysis of our result in doing so we assumed 10 cm error in altimeter water level this results in about less than 10 difference in mean annual discharge of all virtual stations to their initial estimates except for the kachla bridge and kanpur during the non monsoon period the difference in average monthly discharge is less than 10 for all months the difference in average monthly discharge at kachla bridge and kanpur in the non monsoon period is about 15 4 discussion to evaluate the performance of virtual stations we calculate nash sutcliffe efficiency nse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and pbias nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 1999 moriasi et al 2007 nse is used to quantify the magnitude of relative variance with measured discharge the rsr for the error index and pbias for the average bias in the simulated values figs 7 and 8 show a comparison between the observed and estimated discharge we followed the performance rating to evaluate the result obtained for each of the virtual stations moriasi et al 2007 the estimated discharge is considered satisfactory if nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 and pbias 25 table 6 reports the quantitative statistics of the predicted discharge at each of the virtual stations based on these indices we report the performance of our rating curves to estimate discharge at the virtual stations table 6 we observed estimated discharge at the virtual stations compare well with the average monthly discharge measured at the gauge station the correlation of determination r 2 between the estimated and measured discharge is in range between 0 87 0 98 nse 0 84 0 98 and rsr 0 15 to 0 38 according to moriasi et al 2007 the values of our indices can be considered satisfactory we observed pbias in range 13 27 based on this value we can qualitatively categorise the estimated discharge at the virtual stations as satisfactory and unsatisfactory for any model it is important to estimate the associated uncertainty in the result to assess the uncertainty we have considered nse rsr and pbias indices in the lower ganga reaches the estimated discharge accord well with the measured discharge at the nearest gauge station for example estimated discharge near azmabad nse 0 98 rsr 0 15 pbias 13 and r 2 0 98 and farakka nse 0 96 rsr 0 21 pbias 17 and r 2 0 96 are highly correlated with the discharge measured at the nearest gauge station in contrast virtual stations kachla bridge kanpur shahzadpur mirzapur in the middle ganga relatively exhibit a large uncertainty in the estimated discharge this is probably associated with the relatively less discharge in the middle reaches of the ganga river as compared to the lower reaches another source of uncertainty in the estimated discharge is due to the temporal resolution of the satellite altimeter we have used data from different satellite altimeter missions to estimate the monthly discharge at the virtual stations compilation of water level data from multiple altimeter satellites can provide a repeat measurement at higher frequency some altimeter missions provide more than one repetitive measurement of the stage in a month whereas other provide just one measurement the repetitive altimeter data of a given month is averaged to get the monthly estimate of the water level whereas if a satellite altimeter has just one pass that water level has been considered a representative value for that month this irregular sampling may result in a discrepancy between the estimated discharge and average monthly discharge at the ground station especially during the peak flow we observed that the discharge estimated from the satellite altimeter having a single pass in a given month results in a large difference from the measured discharge at the gauge station according to papa et al 2010 the estimated discharge of the ganga brahmaputra river should not exceed or below more than 20 from gauge discharge using 35 days sampling resolution in our case 80 90 discharge residual errors are under the range of 20 we notice estimated discharge at the virtual stations is relatively high at the locations where flow of the ganga river is relatively less the uncertainty in the simulated discharge is also due to the proper calibration of the water level between the gauge and virtual stations in rivers it has been observed that the accuracy of water level obtained from publicly available satellite altimeter data varies in a range between 10 cm to 100 cm dubey et al 2015 schwatke et al 2015 whereas the central water commission cwc new delhi reports the water level for the indian rivers within an accuracy of 5 mm this difference in the accuracy of the water level introduces uncertainty in the final discharge estimated from the satellite altimeter 5 conclusion and future outlook water level derived from satellite altimeter mission can be used to estimate monthly average discharge at different reaches along the ganga river this study relies on empirical stage discharge relationship between the water level obtained from the satellite altimeter to the discharge measured at the nearest gauge station our rating curves provide an accurate estimate of discharge at the lower reaches azmabad and farakka of the ganga river this is probably associated with the deeper flow wider channel and high discharge regime table 5 in the lower ganga similarly in the middle ganga shallow flow and low discharge table 5 results in relatively high uncertainty in the estimated discharge based on the statistical evaluation for all our virtual stations the estimated monthly average discharge fall in the range between good to satisfactory this study is a step towards estimating discharge in the ungauged river basins from satellite altimeter data though we applied our methodology only on alluvial reaches of the ganga river it can be extended to other alluvial and bedrock rivers of different geological and climatic regimes if the ground measurement of discharge is accessible at present our methodology requires at least one gauge station in the proximity of altimeter track to establish a stage discharge rating curve in the absence of gauge discharge establishing such a curve will be challenging the upcoming swot mission is expected to fill this gap in estimating discharge in ungauged river basins solely from satellite data credit authorship contribution statement atul kumar rai conceptualization

4117,the main aim of this paper was to test a recently theoretically deduced flow resistance equation based on a power velocity profile using a wide database of available measurements carried out in laboratory and field experimental runs with overland flow under simulated rainfall in comparison with previous calibrations and validations of this theoretically deduced flow resistance equation the used database by emmett is characterized by a wide range of rainfall intensities from 79 2 to 303 5 mm h 1 for laboratory runs and from 178 3 to 215 9 mm h 1 for field investigations and bed slopes from 0 33 to 17 for laboratory runs and from 2 9 to 33 2 for field investigations for the first time the wide emmett s database of laboratory runs carried out by an overland flow subjected to rainfall in a rough bed flume was used for testing the theoretical resistance law furthermore the seven investigated field vegetated plots allowed to broaden the range of examined subcritical flows and rainfall intensity laboratory data were divided into two datasets calibration and testing and the overland flow measurements on a smooth bed by yoon and wenzel were added to the testing dataset to assess the applicability of the calibrated equation for different bed roughness conditions the available laboratory measurements of flow velocity water depth hydraulic cross section area wetted perimeter and bed slope allowed both to calibrate and test the relationship between the velocity profile parameter Î³ the bed slope the flow froude number and the rainfall reynolds number which is a dimensionless group representing the effect of rainfall intensity on flow resistance the field data were used to calibrate the same flow resistance law and evaluate the effect of different types of vegetation adapting the relationship obtained by nicosia et al the developed analysis showed that i the theoretical flow resistance equation gave an accurate estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor for overland flow under simulated rainfall on rough bed both in laboratory and in field condition ii the flow resistance increased with rainfall intensity for the investigated laminar overland flow iii the flow resistance relationship is able to take into account different vegetation types characterized by different roughness keywords vegetation rainfall simulation velocity profile overland flow dimensional analysis self similarity 1 introduction bare soil on hillslopes is vulnerable to rainfall and runoff effects determining different types of erosion as interrill and rill on interrill areas the main erosive processes are the detachment of soil particles determined by raindrop impact and the transport of the sediments to rill channels by overland flow recognizable characteristics of overland flow are low values of water depth and bed shear stress mutchler and young 1975 toy et al 2002 the study of overland flow is complex since the variables are not easily definable and simple hydraulic procedures for predicting overland flow are roughly applicable emmett 1970 in fact overland flow is both unsteady and spatially varied since it is supplied by rain and depleted by infiltration which vary with time and location emmett 1970 flow may be either laminar turbulent or transitional flow depths may change from subcritical to supercritical and the unsteadiness of flow could cause the formation of roll waves emmett 1970 the impact of raindrops on the flow determines both an increase of flow turbulence and a retarding effect on mean flow velocity making overland flow under rainfall a disturbed laminar flow emmett 1970 for considering that the bed surface affects the overland flow motion many experiments have been carried out for both smooth and rough bed the total flow resistance in smooth rough and sloping bed condition is constituted by the internal fluid resistance and frictional resistance at the channel boundary katz et al 1995 for a uniform laminar flow which is not affected by boundary roughness characterized by a linear variation of the flow shear stress with the bottom distance and a value of the flow velocity equal to zero at the boundary the local velocity increases parabolically to a maximum velocity at the free surface yalin 1977 katz et al 1995 integrating the parabolic velocity distribution the following expression of the mean velocity v is obtained yalin 1977 1 v u 1 3 u h Î½ k in which u grs is the shear velocity r is the hydraulic radius equal to the ratio between the cross section area and the wetted perimeter both depending on the cross section shape and water depth h s is the bed slope g is acceleration due to gravity and vk is the water kinematic viscosity for laminar flow conditions multiplying both members of eq 1 for v u and taking into account that the darcy weisbach friction factor f 8 u 2 v2 the following theoretical expression of f is obtained yoon and wenzel 1971 yalin 1977 katz et al 1995 2 f k re in which re is the flow reynolds number equal to v h vk and the constant k is equal to 24 for uniform flow on a smooth bed for an overland flow under rainfall yoon and wenzel 1971 and katz et al 1995 showed that the constant k becomes larger than the theoretical value for smooth laminar flow and increases with rainfall intensity in other words for a laminar overland flow eq 2 demonstrates that resistance increases with rainfall intensity yoon and wenzel 1971 carried out some experiments on a smooth bed flume under four simulated rainfall intensities ranging from 12 7 to 381 mm h 1 for two slope values equal to 0 5 and 1 these authors found that re affects flow resistance in the range 191 re 5700 and the effect of rainfall intensity on flow resistance is almost negligible for re 2000 while flow resistance increases with rainfall intensity for re 2000 shen and li 1973 investigated overland flow on a smooth bed using a 0 6 m wide and 18 3 m long flume with plexiglass walls and a stainless steel bottom the experimental runs were carried out using rainfall intensities ranging from 190 to 444 mm h 1 these authors confirmed that the darcy weisbach friction factor is influenced by the flow reynolds number and the rainfall intensity for re 2000 savat 1977 using a unique value of rainfall intensity equal to 60 mm h 1 and a smooth bed found that for increasing degree of flow turbulence or slope angle the effect of rainfall decreases however the natural condition on hillslopes is far from that of smooth bed experiments in fact different components of flow resistance e g stone cover vegetation elements rainfall gilley et al 1992 rauws 1988 should be considered since it is influenced by a complex interaction among vegetation grain roughness and other friction terms other experiments carried out on a rough bed sometimes including vegetation are available in literature emmett 1970 carried out some experiments studying overland flow behavior with two different setups the first setup was created using a laboratory flume with adjustable slope 0 33 to 17 and sand grains as roughness bed elements the second one was created using seven sloping 2 9 to 33 2 field plots with vegetation located in three different geographical areas in both conditions a rainfall simulator was used to reproduce different values of rainfall intensities from 79 2 to 303 5 mm h 1 for laboratory runs and from 178 3 to 215 9 mm h 1 for field investigations the laboratory experiments were characterized by reynolds number varying from 5 to 327 laminar flow regime and froude number f v gh 0 5 from 0 021 to 1 61 from subcritical to supercritical flow while the field investigation was carried out for laminar flow regime 7 re 374 and subcritical flow 0 008 f 0 76 the comparison between field and laboratory data highlighted the extreme influence of vegetation and topographic irregularities on flow resistance in natural hillslopes field plot data by emmett 1970 showed that flow resistance expressed as manning s n coefficient was on average about 0 6 and the darcy weisbach friction factor was on average about 200 katz et al 1995 carried out investigations in a flume 4 87 m long and 1 m wide with a rough bed obtained by glued sand grains using three different slope values 4 6 and 8 and two simulated rainfall intensities 40 9 and 115 1 mm h 1 these authors found that the raindrop impact and the channel bed roughness influenced the k coefficient of eq 2 mÃ¼gler et al 2011 carried out an experiment on a 10 m 4 m rainfall simulation plot to test four different roughness models with high resolution velocity data the use of a calibrated manning coefficient n model with a roughness formulation depending on flow depth jain et al 2004 allowed to obtain the best results recently nearing et al 2017 also experienced overland flow with simulated rainfall in 2 m 6 m plots using two rainfall intensities 59 and 178 mm h 1 and three different slopes 5 12 and 20 nearing et al 2017 found that in steeper slopes the soil surface tends to evolve with roughness values greater than in shallower slopes and the increase of flow velocity in steeper slopes is balanced by the increase of roughness the analysis highlighted that flow velocity depends exclusively on discharge and is independent of slope gradient and rainfall intensity this state named slope velocity equilibrium is hypothesized to change naturally over time in dependence of the interaction between soil surface morphology and overland flow this finding is also similar to the feedback mechanism hypothesized for rill flows by govers 1992 di stefano et al 2018 palmeri et al 2018 and used to justify the independence between slope and mean flow velocity at southwest watershed research center 272 experiments were carried out for overland flow under simulated rainfalls with intensity ranging from 60 to 181 mm h 1 on 2 6 m plots located in different sites 23 semiarid rangeland locations in arizona and nevada polyakov et al 2018 these plots were characterized by a wide range of slopes and four different types of vegetation simulation sites included brush and grassland areas with various degrees of disturbance by grazing wildfire or brush removal ferro 2019 studied the relationship between the vertical power velocity distribution and the biomechanical characteristics of vegetation the channel slope the reynolds number and the flow froude number the experiments were carried out in a straight flume having a bed covered by grass like vegetation with different stem concentrations this analysis distinguished between the low values and the highest ones of stem concentrations for which a quasi smooth skimming flow occurred the analysis showed that a very accurate darcy weisbach friction factor estimate can be obtained by a theoretical approach relating flow resistance to a power velocity profile a limit in simulating overland flow by hillslope scale runoff models is that the use of hydraulic equations such as manning and darcy weisbach is extremely simplistic smith et al 2007 and the resistance coefficient changes for different surface conditions kowobari et al 1972 furthermore the retarding effect of rainfall impact with the associated increase of flow turbulence and the influence of vegetation have been scarcely studied ferro and nicosia 2020 recently nicosia et al 2020a nicosia et al 2020b nicosia et al 2020c have successfully tested a theoretical approach to estimate overland flow resistance using literature databases obtained for different roughness conditions in particular the databases by yoon and wenzel 1971 nearing at al 2017 and polyakov et al 2018 obtained for experiments carried out on a smooth bed on a rough bed and on a rough bed with vegetation cover respectively were used the aim of this paper was to test the theoretically deduced flow resistance equation based on a power velocity profile di stefano et al 2017 ferro 2017 2018 2019 ferro and porto 2018 palmeri et al 2018 for the first time the wide emmett s 1970 data base of overland flows under simulated rainfall on a rough bed laboratory flume and on field plots with presence of vegetation was used to test the theoretical overland flow resistance equation these experiments span a wide range of rainfall intensities and bed slopes table 1 this test allows to increase the applicability range of the theoretical flow resistance law in terms of rainfall intensity slope and roughness condition in particular the laboratory measurements by emmett 1970 were carried out using 36 values of rainfall intensity while the data by yoon and wenzel 1971 used for previous calibrations and validations of this theoretically deduced flow resistance equation by nicosia et al 2020a were obtained using only four values of rainfall intensity the 580 experimental runs by emmett 1970 correspond to six values of slope while the 93 measurements by yoon and wenzel 1971 were carried out for two slopes 0 5 and 1 for the field data in comparison with the measurements by polyakov et al 2018 used in previous research nicosia et al 2020c the dataset by emmett 1970 allows to extend the ranges of the investigated froude number and rainfall intensity the available measurements allowed i the calibration and validation for both conditions laboratory and field data of the relationship between the velocity profile parameter Î³ the bed slope the flow froude number and a dimensionless group representative of rainfall intensity effects rain reynolds number ii the assessment of the influence of rainfall on flow resistance and iii the assessment of the contribution of different types of vegetation to flow resistance 2 a brief review of the theoretical flow resistance equation the theoretical overland flow resistance equation was already described in previous papers by nicosia et al 2020a nicosia et al 2020b nicosia et al 2020c and only a brief remind of this theory is presented in this section and in appendix a the following functional relationship barenblatt 1987 1993 ferro 1997 expresses the local flow velocity distribution v y along a given

rewritten as follows 5 v u Î³ u h Î½ k h d s re i f u y Î½ k Î´ in which rei i h vk is the rain reynolds number and the exponent Î´ can be calculated by the following theoretical equation barenblatt

considering both that the average velocity v is located under the water surface and the mean velocity profile whose integration gives v is calculated by averaging for each distance y the velocity

the calculated Î± values vary in a very narrow range and the mean value is equal to 0 134 for laboratory data and 0 132 for field data these values agree with previous studies by nicosia et al 2020a nicosia et al 2020b nicosia et al 2020c in the following analysis eq 9 will be applied with Î± calculated by eq 10 the reliability of the flow resistance eq 8 was tested in previous studies for different hydraulic conditions ferro 2017 2018 2019 ferro and porto 2018 di stefano et al 2017 palmeri et al 2018 nicosia et al 2020a nicosia et al 2020b nicosia et al 2020c applying the proposed

2020b using field measurements by nearing et al 2017 for an overland flow on a stony hillslope with simulated rainfall rainfall intensity equal to 59 and 178 mm h 1 demonstrated that flow reynolds number re is not able to explain the rainfall effect and as a consequence both rei and re are predictive variables of the darcy weisbach friction factor nicosia et al 2020b using 168 measurements demonstrated the applicability of eq 12 with a 0 323 b 1 2833 c 0 6698 and e 0 0787 and verified that eq 11 calibrated with the same data a 0 4054 b 1 2794 c 0 6633 underestimates Î³v values corresponding to a rainfall intensity of 59 mm h 1 whereas it overestimates those corresponding to i 178 mm h 1 nicosia et al 2020c analyzing the measurements carried out by polyakov et al 2018 with four different types of vegetation 460 data with s from 3 6 to 39 6 16 re 709 and 0 02 f 0 47 proposed the following equation to estimate the Î³ parameter 13 Î³ v a f 1 27 s 0 68 re i 0 056 in which a coefficient weakly depends on type of vegetation although the four types of vegetation were quite different this result was explained by the fact that the experiments by polyakov et al 2018 were carried out in a laminar flow regime 16 re 709 for which the effect of roughness on flow resistance was negligible however the analysis also revealed that the best method to evaluate the darcy weisbach friction factor is to use a coefficient a specific for each vegetation type 3 measurements of overland flow resistance under rainfall used in this investigation 3 1 laboratory data in this investigation the measurements carried out by emmett 1970 in laboratory and field conditions were used all laboratory tests were made in the hydraulics laboratory of the u s geological survey washington d c a flume constituted by a plywood bed approximately 4 6 m long and 1 22 m wide supported by timber beams was constructed to represent a segment of hillslope length the slope was adjustable and the values investigated varied from 0 33 to 17 flume walls were 0 076 m high and made of top layer of grains being smoothed by excess varnish the bed was covered with a well sorted layer of sieved sand used as grain roughness artificial rainfall was produced using a commercially available type of line sprinkler this apparatus consisted of a 0 013 m copper pipe equal in length to the length of the flume a series of specially punched holes at 0 305 m intervals along the pipe allowed the sprinklers to spray a fan of water in a narrow width along the line of sprinklers water was centrally supplied to each sprinkler unit through a gate valve and pressure gage in the laboratory two sprinkler units were placed approximately 1 8 m above the flume floor and pointed downward the 36 values of rainfall intensities examined ranged from 79 2 to 303 5 mm h 1 measurements of flow depth and determination of flume slope were obtained with a point gage mounted on a precision leveled carriage which was independent of the flume structure water depths with accuracy which was within 0 15 mm were recorded as the difference between the elevation of the flume floor and the water surface depth readings were recorded for three transverse locations at the quarter points 0 305 m and 0 914 m and midpoint 0 61 m across the flume width and fifteen longitudinal locations at each 0 305 m downslope position for each run then 45 observations of depth were recorded and successively each set of three transverse readings were averaged to give a mean depth for each downslope position then the latter were averaged to obtain the mean depth surface velocity was measured by tracing the travel of dye over specified downslope distances which had been marked out as a grid system on the flume floor in particular a waterproof and brilliantly colored powder was sprinkled on the water surface and its travelling time over specified distances was measured these experiments were characterized by reynolds number varying from 5 to 327 laminar flow regime and froude numbers from 0 021 to 1 61 subcritical to supercritical flow furthermore the rain reynolds number values ranged from 0 01 to 0 33 while the darcy weisbach friction factor varied from 0 07 to 129 7 3 2 field data all the seven field sites pc1 pc2 pc3 nf1 nf2 bl1 and bl2 were located in sublette county west central wyoming and represented three different geographical areas pole creek new fork river and boulder lake at each site detailed studies were conducted to determine plant species and vegetation characteristics that are listed in table a of the summary of data of the paper by emmett 1970 https pubs usgs gov pp 0662a report pdf the runoff plot established at each site was 2 1 m wide and generally longer than 12 2 m seven different values of slopes were investigated 9 6 for pc1 33 2 for pc2 20 8 for pc3 10 for nf1 2 9 for nf2 18 8 for bl1 and 33 1 for bl2 the same type of line sprinkler used in the laboratory investigation was also used to simulate rainfall in field in the field arrangement the only difference was that the sprinklers were placed on the ground rather than suspended above the plot the sprinklers were placed 0 152 m inward from each side of the plot and ran continuously along the length of the plot with the sprinklers placed on the ground the spray of water was pointed upward and reached a height of 3 m before falling downward over the plot in this case values of rainfall intensities ranged from 178 3 mm h 1 to 215 9 mm h 1 surface velocity was measured for two trails at each site one trail was essentially over the left half of slope and the other over the right half a liquid dye was poured over the ground surface at the upper end of the runoff plot the leading edge of the tracer was observed to record the increment of travelling time over each 0 305 m reach allowing to determine the value of average flow velocity water depths were measured with the same type of point gage used in the laboratory investigation and using a grid system 0 305 m transverse by a 0 61 m downslope eight values were recorded for each downslope position and then averaged to obtain the mean depth these 141 field experiments were characterized by reynolds number varying from 7 to 374 laminar flow regime and froude numbers from 0 008 to 0 76 subcritical flow furthermore the rain reynolds number values ranged from 0 03 to 1 35 while the darcy weisbach friction factor varied from 2 57 to 3214 9 4 results 4 1 calibrating and testing the overland flow resistance law by laboratory data the available 580 laboratory data by emmett 1970 were divided into two datasets 290 data for calibration and 290 for test the dataset for calibrating eq 12 characterized by rainfall intensities varying from 79 2 to 303 5 mm h 1 and slope values from 0 33 to 17 allowed to obtain the following equation 14 Î³ v 0 2856 f 1 0657 s 0 6068 re i 0 1614 which is characterized by a coefficient of

by 290 laboratory data by emmett 1970 and 93 experimental data by yoon and wenzel 1971 was used to test the applicability of eq 14 the data by emmett 1970 were characterized by the same ranges of slope and rainfall intensity as the calibration dataset while the data by yoon and wenzel 1971 were obtained for rainfall intensity values equal to 12 7 31 75 95 25 and 381 mm h 1 and two slopes 0 5 and 1 on a smooth bed table 1 the data by yoon and wenzel 1971 were added to the testing dataset to assess the applicability of the calibrated equation for different values of reynolds number and darcy weisbach friction factor fig 2 due to different bed roughness fig 3 a shows the comparison between the Î³v values calculated by eq 9 and those calculated by eq 14 in fig 3b the comparison for the testing dataset between the measured values of the darcy weisbach friction factor and those calculated by eq 15 is shown the agreement is characterized by a rmse value of 3 32 the friction factor values calculated by eq 15 are characterized by errors that are less than or equal to 20 for 82 of cases and less than or equal to 10 for 53 5 of cases the test showed that for the smooth bed condition and lowest values of rainfall intensity 12 7 and 31 75 mm h 1 the calibrated equation tends to overestimate the Î³v values fig 3a underestimating the f values fig 3b consequently instead a good agreement between the measured and calculated values for both Î³v and f is obtained for the highest rainfall intensities 95 25 and 381 mm h 1 then eq 14 with exponent e see eq 12 of rei varying from 0 01 to 0 33 set to 0 was tested with both the calibrating and testing datasets to evaluate the influence of the rainfall intensity on Î³v fixing e 0 eq 14 reduces to 16 Î³ v 0 2856 f 1 0657 s 0

calibration dataset is shown the agreement between measured and calculated values is characterized by a rmse equal to 3 52 eq 16 systematically underestimates Î³v values fig 4a and consequently eq 17 gives a systematic overestimation of the darcy weisbach friction factor values fig 4b fig 5 a shows the comparison between the Î³v values calculated by eq 9 and those calculated by eq 16 for testing dataset fig 5b shows the comparison between the measured values of the darcy weisbach friction factor and those calculated by eq 17 for the testing dataset in this case the agreement between measured

overestimates the f values fig 5b 4 2 calibrating and testing the overland flow resistance law by field data the second dataset constituted by 141 field measurements led to the following equation 18 Î³ v 0 39 f 1 318 s 0 6602 re i 0 0612 which is characterized by a coefficient of determination equal to 0 994 in fig 6 a the comparison between the Î³v values calculated by eq 9 and those calculated by eq 18 is shown eq 18 was introduced into eq 8 and the following equation to estimate f was obtained 19 f 8 2 1 Î´ 0 39 f 1 318 4 4817 Î´ 1 Î´ 2 s 0 6602 re i 0 0612 2 1 Î´ in fig 6b the comparison between the measured values of the darcy weisbach friction factor and those calculated by eq 19 is shown the friction factor values calculated by eq 19 are characterized by errors that are less than or equal to 20 for 95 2 of cases and less than or equal to 10 for 84 2 of cases the overland flow data by polyakov et al 2018 were used to test the applicability of eq 18 these data have been obtained with similar hydraulic conditions to those investigated by emmett 1970 in fact fig 7 which shows the relationship between the reynolds number and the darcy weisbach friction factor for both the literature databases highlights the overlap of the corresponding data points the measurements by polyakov et al 2018 were carried out with four different types of vegetation juniper perennial grass shrub and treated juniper for slopes ranging from 3 6 to 39 6 and rainfall intensity varying from 60 to 181 mm h 1 fig 8 a shows the comparison between the measured Î³v values and those calculated by eq 18 in fig 8 b the comparison between the measured values of the darcy weisbach friction factor and those calculated by eq 19 is shown the latter is characterized by errors that are less than or equal to 20 for 97 6 of cases and less than or equal to 10 for 82 4 of cases taking into account that eq 13 was obtained by nicosia et al 2020c analyzing the data published by polyakov et al 2018 the field data by emmett 1970 were also used here to estimate the values of a coefficient and test the applicability of this calibrated eq 13 in vegetated plots the data were divided into seven sub datasets corresponding to the different sites for each sub dataset the behavior of the pairs f 1 27 s 0 68 re i 0 056 Î³v was investigated and a value of the a coefficient equal to the slope coefficient of the best fit straight line passing through the origin of the axes was obtained in table 2 the values of a coefficient obtained for each site are listed since a coefficient represents the effect of the vegetation on flow resistance the relationship between the obtained a values and the estimated percentage of vegetation cover c plotted in table 2 of the paper by emmett 1970 table 2 was investigated fig 9 since the a values of the sites within nf and bl geographical areas are very similar the mean values equal to 0 3255 and 0 3844 respectively can be used instead for pc area a can be expressed by a power relationship of the vegetation cover fig 9 fig 10 a shows the comparison between the measured Î³v values and those calculated introducing these a values into eq 13 in fig 10b the comparison between the measured values of the darcy weisbach friction factor and those calculated coupling eq 13 with these a values and eq 8 is shown the calculated friction factor values are characterized by errors that are less than or equal to 20 for 97 2 of cases and less than or equal to 10 for 63 1 of cases 5 discussion 5 1 calibrating and testing the overland flow resistance law by laboratory data the results obtained for the laboratory datasets highlighted that the calibrated eq 14 and eq 15 give a good estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor the choice to test this equation using data obtained both on rough and smooth beds was made to assess if the equation calibrated for a rough bed condition can be used for a different roughness condition neglecting the contribution of the sediment transport to total overland flow resistance the latter is only due to bed roughness and rainfall effect previous measurements yoon and wenzel 1971 demonstrated that rainfall impacting on an overland flow produces a retarding effect on local flow velocity particularly near the free surface and this effect is more evident at low reynolds numbers where the flow would be laminar without rainfall in fact if the direction of fall of raindrops is almost normal to the water surface the component of raindrop momentum in the mean flow direction is negligible and as a consequence a quote of mean flow momentum has to be transferred to accelerate the raindrop mass near the surface there is a major transfer of flow momentum and thus the velocity retardation decreases from the surface downward for given rainfall intensity and drop size the rate of raindrop impact does not change while for increasing flow reynolds number the mean flow momentum increases and the rate of momentum transfer decreases in other words when re increases the quote of flow momentum transferred to accelerate raindrop mass decreases and as a consequence the effect on flow resistance is limited according to nicosia et al 2020a the rainfall effect is always negligible for turbulent flows re 2000 and it is also negligible for laminar flows re 2000 under an unknown critical value of rainfall intensity falling in the range 31 75 95 25 mm h 1 therefore when the rainfall intensity is equal to 12 7 and 31 75 mm h 1 even if the flow regime is laminar the rainfall effect becomes negligible the bed roughness effect is dominant and cannot be neglected this implies the inapplicability of the equation obtained for a rough bed condition to estimate the darcy weisbach friction factor for a smooth bed condition in contrast for the highest rainfall intensities 95 25 and 381 mm h 1 the applicability of a single equation for both smooth and rough beds demonstrates that the contribution of rainfall to total flow resistance is dominant in comparison with that due to bed roughness in other words for the highest rainfall intensity values the retarding effect of velocity due to rainfall impact is dominant respect to that due to bed roughness the data analysis showed that neglecting the rainfall effect the calculated darcy weisbach friction factor eq 17 is overestimated for both the calibrating and testing datasets highlighting the dependence of flow resistance on rei in particular flow resistance increases for increasing rei and rainfall intensity accordingly this result can be physically justified taking into account that the laboratory runs by emmett 1970 are all characterized by a laminar flow regime 5 re 327 and yoon and wenzel 1971 carried out measurements with re 2000 for 75 of the investigated overland flows fig 2 in other words emmett 1970 and yoon and wenzel 1971 investigated hydraulic conditions in which the retarding effects of rainfall cannot be neglected 5 2 calibrating and testing the overland flow resistance law by field data for the field data the relationship between the reynolds number and the darcy weisbach friction factor fig 7 is poorly in agreement with previous results for rill flows by nearing et al 1997 peng et al 2015 and di stefano et al 2017 for eroding rills nearing et al 1997 suggested that flow reynolds number is not an appropriate predictor of hydraulic friction because erosion processes cause form roughness in the rill and established that the relationship f re is primarily influenced by slope gradient s the experiments by peng et al 2015 confirmed that a power relationship can be used to fit the pairs f re and this correlation varied with slope gradient the pairs re f measured by di stefano et al 2017 confirmed that the darcy weisbach friction factor tends to decrease as re increases and an increasing trend of f with slope can be detected they concluded that the poor correlation f re suggests that in agreement with nearing et al 1997 re is not a unique predictor of hydraulic roughness in rills the proposed approach guaranteed a very reliable estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor for both calibrating and testing dataset confirming that the flow resistance increases with rainfall intensity even if coupling eq 8 with eq 18 or eq 13 gives comparable f estimates eq 13 with the a values obtained for each geographical area allows taking into account the effect of different vegetation types the range of a is quite narrow 0 3243 0 3892 confirming for a wider range of s re and f the findings by nicosia et al 2020c that a does not change significantly with different types of vegetation for the laminar flow regime in fact in a laminar flow regime the effect of roughness due to different types of vegetation on flow resistance is scarcely appreciable moreover the a value 0 3255 obtained for the nf geographical area is very close to that 0 3215 nicosia et al 2020c related to the perennial grass vegetation type by polyakov et al 2018 as a consequence of comparable vegetation between the two cases 6 conclusions overland flow data by emmett 1970 obtained by rainfall simulation experiments carried out in laboratory and field condition were used to test a theoretical flow resistance law deduced by applying the Ï theorem of dimensional analysis and self similarity theory the available laboratory measurements divided into two datasets were used to calibrate and test the theoretical relationship between the velocity profile parameter Î³v the bed slope the flow froude number and the rain reynolds number the data by yoon and wenzel 1971 obtained on a smooth bed were added to the testing dataset to evaluate the applicability of the equation for a different bed roughness the consequent theoretical flow resistance law gave low estimate errors of the darcy weisbach friction factor for the rough bed condition and limited to the highest rainfall intensities for the smooth bed one instead for the lowest values 12 7 and 31 75 mm h 1 the influence of the bed roughness was not negligible and the estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor for a smooth bed condition was unreliable the data analysis showed that neglecting the rainfall effect the calculated darcy weisbach friction factor eq 17 is overestimated for both the calibrating and testing datasets confirming the dependence of flow resistance on rei in particular flow resistance increases for increasing rei and rainfall intensity accordingly the equation calibrated by field data gave a very good estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor for both the calibration and testing dataset the a coefficient values obtained confirmed that in a laminar flow regime the effect of roughness due to different types of vegetation on flow resistance is scarcely appreciable the results obtained by laboratory and field data agree with the conclusion suggested by yoon and wenzel 1971 that for flow reynolds number 2000 flow resistance increases with rainfall intensity the following conclusions can be deduced by the developed analysis for laboratory data when the rainfall intensity is low the bed roughness effect is dominant and cannot be neglected for laboratory data when the rainfall intensities are high the increased contribution of rainfall to total flow resistance compared to that due to bed roughness leads to the applicability of a single equation for both smooth and rough beds for laboratory data neglecting the rainfall effect the calculated darcy weisbach friction factor eq 17 is overestimated for both the calibrating and testing datasets for field data the estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor by eq 8 coupled with eq 13 with the a values obtained for each geographical area allows taking into account the effect of different vegetation types new experiments with different flow regime conditions should be carried out to study overland flow with different rainfall and surface roughness conditions and to evaluate the contribution of the vegetation to flow resistance credit authorship

4117,the main aim of this paper was to test a recently theoretically deduced flow resistance equation based on a power velocity profile using a wide database of available measurements carried out in laboratory and field experimental runs with overland flow under simulated rainfall in comparison with previous calibrations and validations of this theoretically deduced flow resistance equation the used database by emmett is characterized by a wide range of rainfall intensities from 79 2 to 303 5 mm h 1 for laboratory runs and from 178 3 to 215 9 mm h 1 for field investigations and bed slopes from 0 33 to 17 for laboratory runs and from 2 9 to 33 2 for field investigations for the first time the wide emmett s database of laboratory runs carried out by an overland flow subjected to rainfall in a rough bed flume was used for testing the theoretical resistance law furthermore the seven investigated field vegetated plots allowed to broaden the range of examined subcritical flows and rainfall intensity laboratory data were divided into two datasets calibration and testing and the overland flow measurements on a smooth bed by yoon and wenzel were added to the testing dataset to assess the applicability of the calibrated equation for different bed roughness conditions the available laboratory measurements of flow velocity water depth hydraulic cross section area wetted perimeter and bed slope allowed both to calibrate and test the relationship between the velocity profile parameter Î³ the bed slope the flow froude number and the rainfall reynolds number which is a dimensionless group representing the effect of rainfall intensity on flow resistance the field data were used to calibrate the same flow resistance law and evaluate the effect of different types of vegetation adapting the relationship obtained by nicosia et al the developed analysis showed that i the theoretical flow resistance equation gave an accurate estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor for overland flow under simulated rainfall on rough bed both in laboratory and in field condition ii the flow resistance increased with rainfall intensity for the investigated laminar overland flow iii the flow resistance relationship is able to take into account different vegetation types characterized by different roughness keywords vegetation rainfall simulation velocity profile overland flow dimensional analysis self similarity 1 introduction bare soil on hillslopes is vulnerable to rainfall and runoff effects determining different types of erosion as interrill and rill on interrill areas the main erosive processes are the detachment of soil particles determined by raindrop impact and the transport of the sediments to rill channels by overland flow recognizable characteristics of overland flow are low values of water depth and bed shear stress mutchler and young 1975 toy et al 2002 the study of overland flow is complex since the variables are not easily definable and simple hydraulic procedures for predicting overland flow are roughly applicable emmett 1970 in fact overland flow is both unsteady and spatially varied since it is supplied by rain and depleted by infiltration which vary with time and location emmett 1970 flow may be either laminar turbulent or transitional flow depths may change from subcritical to supercritical and the unsteadiness of flow could cause the formation of roll waves emmett 1970 the impact of raindrops on the flow determines both an increase of flow turbulence and a retarding effect on mean flow velocity making overland flow under rainfall a disturbed laminar flow emmett 1970 for considering that the bed surface affects the overland flow motion many experiments have been carried out for both smooth and rough bed the total flow resistance in smooth rough and sloping bed condition is constituted by the internal fluid resistance and frictional resistance at the channel boundary katz et al 1995 for a uniform laminar flow which is not affected by boundary roughness characterized by a linear variation of the flow shear stress with the bottom distance and a value of the flow velocity equal to zero at the boundary the local velocity increases parabolically to a maximum velocity at the free surface yalin 1977 katz et al 1995 integrating the parabolic velocity distribution the following expression of the mean velocity v is obtained yalin 1977 1 v u 1 3 u h Î½ k in which u grs is the shear velocity r is the hydraulic radius equal to the ratio between the cross section area and the wetted perimeter both depending on the cross section shape and water depth h s is the bed slope g is acceleration due to gravity and vk is the water kinematic viscosity for laminar flow conditions multiplying both members of eq 1 for v u and taking into account that the darcy weisbach friction factor f 8 u 2 v2 the following theoretical expression of f is obtained yoon and wenzel 1971 yalin 1977 katz et al 1995 2 f k re in which re is the flow reynolds number equal to v h vk and the constant k is equal to 24 for uniform flow on a smooth bed for an overland flow under rainfall yoon and wenzel 1971 and katz et al 1995 showed that the constant k becomes larger than the theoretical value for smooth laminar flow and increases with rainfall intensity in other words for a laminar overland flow eq 2 demonstrates that resistance increases with rainfall intensity yoon and wenzel 1971 carried out some experiments on a smooth bed flume under four simulated rainfall intensities ranging from 12 7 to 381 mm h 1 for two slope values equal to 0 5 and 1 these authors found that re affects flow resistance in the range 191 re 5700 and the effect of rainfall intensity on flow resistance is almost negligible for re 2000 while flow resistance increases with rainfall intensity for re 2000 shen and li 1973 investigated overland flow on a smooth bed using a 0 6 m wide and 18 3 m long flume with plexiglass walls and a stainless steel bottom the experimental runs were carried out using rainfall intensities ranging from 190 to 444 mm h 1 these authors confirmed that the darcy weisbach friction factor is influenced by the flow reynolds number and the rainfall intensity for re 2000 savat 1977 using a unique value of rainfall intensity equal to 60 mm h 1 and a smooth bed found that for increasing degree of flow turbulence or slope angle the effect of rainfall decreases however the natural condition on hillslopes is far from that of smooth bed experiments in fact different components of flow resistance e g stone cover vegetation elements rainfall gilley et al 1992 rauws 1988 should be considered since it is influenced by a complex interaction among vegetation grain roughness and other friction terms other experiments carried out on a rough bed sometimes including vegetation are available in literature emmett 1970 carried out some experiments studying overland flow behavior with two different setups the first setup was created using a laboratory flume with adjustable slope 0 33 to 17 and sand grains as roughness bed elements the second one was created using seven sloping 2 9 to 33 2 field plots with vegetation located in three different geographical areas in both conditions a rainfall simulator was used to reproduce different values of rainfall intensities from 79 2 to 303 5 mm h 1 for laboratory runs and from 178 3 to 215 9 mm h 1 for field investigations the laboratory experiments were characterized by reynolds number varying from 5 to 327 laminar flow regime and froude number f v gh 0 5 from 0 021 to 1 61 from subcritical to supercritical flow while the field investigation was carried out for laminar flow regime 7 re 374 and subcritical flow 0 008 f 0 76 the comparison between field and laboratory data highlighted the extreme influence of vegetation and topographic irregularities on flow resistance in natural hillslopes field plot data by emmett 1970 showed that flow resistance expressed as manning s n coefficient was on average about 0 6 and the darcy weisbach friction factor was on average about 200 katz et al 1995 carried out investigations in a flume 4 87 m long and 1 m wide with a rough bed obtained by glued sand grains using three different slope values 4 6 and 8 and two simulated rainfall intensities 40 9 and 115 1 mm h 1 these authors found that the raindrop impact and the channel bed roughness influenced the k coefficient of eq 2 mÃ¼gler et al 2011 carried out an experiment on a 10 m 4 m rainfall simulation plot to test four different roughness models with high resolution velocity data the use of a calibrated manning coefficient n model with a roughness formulation depending on flow depth jain et al 2004 allowed to obtain the best results recently nearing et al 2017 also experienced overland flow with simulated rainfall in 2 m 6 m plots using two rainfall intensities 59 and 178 mm h 1 and three different slopes 5 12 and 20 nearing et al 2017 found that in steeper slopes the soil surface tends to evolve with roughness values greater than in shallower slopes and the increase of flow velocity in steeper slopes is balanced by the increase of roughness the analysis highlighted that flow velocity depends exclusively on discharge and is independent of slope gradient and rainfall intensity this state named slope velocity equilibrium is hypothesized to change naturally over time in dependence of the interaction between soil surface morphology and overland flow this finding is also similar to the feedback mechanism hypothesized for rill flows by govers 1992 di stefano et al 2018 palmeri et al 2018 and used to justify the independence between slope and mean flow velocity at southwest watershed research center 272 experiments were carried out for overland flow under simulated rainfalls with intensity ranging from 60 to 181 mm h 1 on 2 6 m plots located in different sites 23 semiarid rangeland locations in arizona and nevada polyakov et al 2018 these plots were characterized by a wide range of slopes and four different types of vegetation simulation sites included brush and grassland areas with various degrees of disturbance by grazing wildfire or brush removal ferro 2019 studied the relationship between the vertical power velocity distribution and the biomechanical characteristics of vegetation the channel slope the reynolds number and the flow froude number the experiments were carried out in a straight flume having a bed covered by grass like vegetation with different stem concentrations this analysis distinguished between the low values and the highest ones of stem concentrations for which a quasi smooth skimming flow occurred the analysis showed that a very accurate darcy weisbach friction factor estimate can be obtained by a theoretical approach relating flow resistance to a power velocity profile a limit in simulating overland flow by hillslope scale runoff models is that the use of hydraulic equations such as manning and darcy weisbach is extremely simplistic smith et al 2007 and the resistance coefficient changes for different surface conditions kowobari et al 1972 furthermore the retarding effect of rainfall impact with the associated increase of flow turbulence and the influence of vegetation have been scarcely studied ferro and nicosia 2020 recently nicosia et al 2020a nicosia et al 2020b nicosia et al 2020c have successfully tested a theoretical approach to estimate overland flow resistance using literature databases obtained for different roughness conditions in particular the databases by yoon and wenzel 1971 nearing at al 2017 and polyakov et al 2018 obtained for experiments carried out on a smooth bed on a rough bed and on a rough bed with vegetation cover respectively were used the aim of this paper was to test the theoretically deduced flow resistance equation based on a power velocity profile di stefano et al 2017 ferro 2017 2018 2019 ferro and porto 2018 palmeri et al 2018 for the first time the wide emmett s 1970 data base of overland flows under simulated rainfall on a rough bed laboratory flume and on field plots with presence of vegetation was used to test the theoretical overland flow resistance equation these experiments span a wide range of rainfall intensities and bed slopes table 1 this test allows to increase the applicability range of the theoretical flow resistance law in terms of rainfall intensity slope and roughness condition in particular the laboratory measurements by emmett 1970 were carried out using 36 values of rainfall intensity while the data by yoon and wenzel 1971 used for previous calibrations and validations of this theoretically deduced flow resistance equation by nicosia et al 2020a were obtained using only four values of rainfall intensity the 580 experimental runs by emmett 1970 correspond to six values of slope while the 93 measurements by yoon and wenzel 1971 were carried out for two slopes 0 5 and 1 for the field data in comparison with the measurements by polyakov et al 2018 used in previous research nicosia et al 2020c the dataset by emmett 1970 allows to extend the ranges of the investigated froude number and rainfall intensity the available measurements allowed i the calibration and validation for both conditions laboratory and field data of the relationship between the velocity profile parameter Î³ the bed slope the flow froude number and a dimensionless group representative of rainfall intensity effects rain reynolds number ii the assessment of the influence of rainfall on flow resistance and iii the assessment of the contribution of different types of vegetation to flow resistance 2 a brief review of the theoretical flow resistance equation the theoretical overland flow resistance equation was already described in previous papers by nicosia et al 2020a nicosia et al 2020b nicosia et al 2020c and only a brief remind of this theory is presented in this section and in appendix a the following functional relationship barenblatt 1987 1993 ferro 1997 expresses the local flow velocity distribution v y along a given

the calculated Î± values vary in a very narrow range and the mean value is equal to 0 134 for laboratory data and 0 132 for field data these values agree with previous studies by nicosia et al 2020a

2020b using field measurements by nearing et al 2017 for an overland flow on a stony hillslope with simulated rainfall rainfall intensity equal to 59 and 178 mm h 1 demonstrated that flow reynolds number re is not able to explain the rainfall effect and as a consequence both rei and re are predictive variables of the darcy weisbach friction factor nicosia et al 2020b using 168 measurements demonstrated the applicability of eq 12 with a 0 323 b 1 2833 c 0 6698 and e 0 0787 and verified that eq 11 calibrated with the same data a 0 4054 b 1 2794 c 0 6633 underestimates Î³v values corresponding to a rainfall intensity of 59 mm h 1 whereas it overestimates those corresponding to i 178 mm h 1 nicosia et al 2020c analyzing the measurements carried out by polyakov et al 2018 with four different types of vegetation 460 data with s from 3 6 to 39 6 16 re 709 and 0 02 f 0 47 proposed the following equation to estimate the Î³ parameter 13 Î³ v a f 1 27 s 0 68 re i 0 056 in which a coefficient weakly depends on type of vegetation although the four types of vegetation were quite different this result was explained by the fact that the experiments by polyakov et al 2018 were carried out in a laminar flow regime 16 re 709 for which the effect of roughness on flow resistance was negligible however the analysis also revealed that the best method to evaluate the darcy weisbach friction factor is to use a coefficient a specific for each vegetation type 3 measurements of overland flow resistance under rainfall used in this investigation 3 1 laboratory data in this investigation the measurements carried out by emmett 1970 in laboratory and field conditions were used all laboratory tests were made in the hydraulics laboratory of the u s geological survey washington d c a flume constituted by a plywood bed approximately 4 6 m long and 1 22 m wide supported by timber beams was constructed to represent a segment of hillslope length the slope was adjustable and the values investigated varied from 0 33 to 17 flume walls were 0 076 m high and made of top layer of grains being smoothed by excess varnish the bed was covered with a well sorted layer of sieved sand used as grain roughness artificial rainfall was produced using a commercially available type of line sprinkler this apparatus consisted of a 0 013 m copper pipe equal in length to the length of the flume a series of specially punched holes at 0 305 m intervals along the pipe allowed the sprinklers to spray a fan of water in a narrow width along the line of sprinklers water was centrally supplied to each sprinkler unit through a gate valve and pressure gage in the laboratory two sprinkler units were placed approximately 1 8 m above the flume floor and pointed downward the 36 values of rainfall intensities examined ranged from 79 2 to 303 5 mm h 1 measurements of flow depth and determination of flume slope were obtained with a point gage mounted on a precision leveled carriage which was independent of the flume structure water depths with accuracy which was within 0 15 mm were recorded as the difference between the elevation of the flume floor and the water surface depth readings were recorded for three transverse locations at the quarter points 0 305 m and 0 914 m and midpoint 0 61 m across the flume width and fifteen longitudinal locations at each 0 305 m downslope position for each run then 45 observations of depth were recorded and successively each set of three transverse readings were averaged to give a mean depth for each downslope position then the latter were averaged to obtain the mean depth surface velocity was measured by tracing the travel of dye over specified downslope distances which had been marked out as a grid system on the flume floor in particular a waterproof and brilliantly colored powder was sprinkled on the water surface and its travelling time over specified distances was measured these experiments were characterized by reynolds number varying from 5 to 327 laminar flow regime and froude numbers from 0 021 to 1 61 subcritical to supercritical flow furthermore the rain reynolds number values ranged from 0 01 to 0 33 while the darcy weisbach friction factor varied from 0 07 to 129 7 3 2 field data all the seven field sites pc1 pc2 pc3 nf1 nf2 bl1 and bl2 were located in sublette county west central wyoming and represented three different geographical areas pole creek new fork river and boulder lake at each site detailed studies were conducted to determine plant species and vegetation characteristics that are listed in table a of the summary of data of the paper by emmett 1970 https pubs usgs gov pp 0662a report pdf the runoff plot established at each site was 2 1 m wide and generally longer than 12 2 m seven different values of slopes were investigated 9 6 for pc1 33 2 for pc2 20 8 for pc3 10 for nf1 2 9 for nf2 18 8 for bl1 and 33 1 for bl2 the same type of line sprinkler used in the laboratory investigation was also used to simulate rainfall in field in the field arrangement the only difference was that the sprinklers were placed on the ground rather than suspended above the plot the sprinklers were placed 0 152 m inward from each side of the plot and ran continuously along the length of the plot with the sprinklers placed on the ground the spray of water was pointed upward and reached a height of 3 m before falling downward over the plot in this case values of rainfall intensities ranged from 178 3 mm h 1 to 215 9 mm h 1 surface velocity was measured for two trails at each site one trail was essentially over the left half of slope and the other over the right half a liquid dye was poured over the ground surface at the upper end of the runoff plot the leading edge of the tracer was observed to record the increment of travelling time over each 0 305 m reach allowing to determine the value of average flow velocity water depths were measured with the same type of point gage used in the laboratory investigation and using a grid system 0 305 m transverse by a 0 61 m downslope eight values were recorded for each downslope position and then averaged to obtain the mean depth these 141 field experiments were characterized by reynolds number varying from 7 to 374 laminar flow regime and froude numbers from 0 008 to 0 76 subcritical flow furthermore the rain reynolds number values ranged from 0 03 to 1 35 while the darcy weisbach friction factor varied from 2 57 to 3214 9 4 results 4 1 calibrating and testing the overland flow resistance law by laboratory data the available 580 laboratory data by emmett 1970 were divided into two datasets 290 data for calibration and 290 for test the dataset for calibrating eq 12 characterized by rainfall intensities varying

values calculated by eq 15 are characterized by errors that are less than or equal to 20 for 82 of cases and less than or equal to 10 for 53 5 of cases the test showed that for the smooth bed condition and lowest values of rainfall intensity 12 7 and 31 75 mm h 1 the calibrated equation tends to overestimate the Î³v values fig 3a underestimating the f values fig 3b consequently instead a good agreement between the measured and calculated values for both Î³v and f is obtained for the highest rainfall intensities 95 25 and 381 mm h 1 then eq 14 with exponent e see eq 12 of rei varying

or equal to 20 for 95 2 of cases and less than or equal to 10 for 84 2 of cases the overland flow data by polyakov et al 2018 were used to test the applicability of eq 18 these data have been obtained with similar hydraulic conditions to those investigated by emmett 1970 in fact fig 7 which shows the relationship between the reynolds number and the darcy weisbach friction factor for both the literature databases highlights the overlap of the corresponding data points the measurements by polyakov et al 2018 were carried out with four different types of vegetation juniper perennial grass shrub and treated juniper for slopes ranging from 3 6 to 39 6 and rainfall intensity varying from 60 to 181 mm h 1 fig 8 a shows the comparison between the measured Î³v values and those calculated by eq 18 in fig 8 b the comparison between the measured values of the darcy weisbach friction factor and those calculated by eq 19 is shown the latter is characterized by errors that are less than or equal to 20 for 97 6 of cases and less than or equal to 10 for 82 4 of cases taking into account that eq 13 was obtained by nicosia et al 2020c analyzing the data published by polyakov et al 2018 the field data by emmett 1970 were also used here to estimate the values of a coefficient and test the applicability of this calibrated eq 13 in vegetated plots the data were divided into seven sub datasets corresponding to the different sites for each sub dataset the behavior of the pairs f 1 27 s 0 68 re i 0 056 Î³v was investigated and a value of the a coefficient equal to the slope coefficient of the best fit straight line passing through the origin of the axes was obtained in table 2 the values of a coefficient obtained for each site are listed since a coefficient represents the effect of the vegetation on flow resistance the relationship between the obtained a values and the estimated percentage of vegetation cover c plotted in table 2 of the paper by emmett 1970 table 2 was investigated fig 9 since the a values of the sites within nf and bl geographical areas are very similar the mean values equal to 0 3255 and 0 3844 respectively can be used instead for pc area a can be expressed by a power relationship of the vegetation cover fig 9 fig 10 a shows the comparison between the measured Î³v values and those calculated introducing these a values into eq 13 in fig 10b the comparison between the measured values of the darcy weisbach friction factor and those calculated coupling eq 13 with these a values and eq 8 is shown the calculated friction factor values are characterized by errors that are less than or equal to 20 for 97 2 of cases and less than or equal to 10 for 63 1 of cases 5 discussion 5 1 calibrating and testing the overland flow resistance law by laboratory data the results obtained for the laboratory datasets highlighted that the calibrated eq 14 and eq 15 give a good estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor the choice to test this equation using data obtained both on rough and smooth beds was made to assess if the equation calibrated for a rough bed condition can be used for a different roughness condition neglecting the contribution of the sediment transport to total overland flow resistance the latter is only due to bed roughness and rainfall effect previous measurements yoon and wenzel 1971 demonstrated that rainfall impacting on an overland flow produces a retarding effect on local flow velocity particularly near the free surface and this effect is more evident at low reynolds numbers where the flow would be laminar without rainfall in fact if the direction of fall of raindrops is almost normal to the water surface the component of raindrop momentum in the mean flow direction is negligible and as a consequence a quote of mean flow momentum has to be transferred to accelerate the raindrop mass near the surface there is a major transfer of flow momentum and thus the velocity retardation decreases from the surface downward for given rainfall intensity and drop size the rate of raindrop impact does not change while for increasing flow reynolds number the mean flow momentum increases and the rate of momentum transfer decreases in other words when re increases the quote of flow momentum transferred to accelerate raindrop mass decreases and as a consequence the effect on flow resistance is limited according to nicosia et al 2020a the rainfall effect is always negligible for turbulent flows re 2000 and it is also negligible for laminar flows re 2000 under an unknown critical value of rainfall intensity falling in the range 31 75 95 25 mm h 1 therefore when the rainfall intensity is equal to 12 7 and 31 75 mm h 1 even if the flow regime is laminar the rainfall effect becomes negligible the bed roughness effect is dominant and cannot be neglected this implies the inapplicability of the equation obtained for a rough bed condition to estimate the darcy weisbach friction factor for a smooth bed condition in contrast for the highest rainfall intensities 95 25 and 381 mm h 1 the applicability of a single equation for both smooth and rough beds demonstrates that the contribution of rainfall to total flow resistance is dominant in comparison with that due to bed roughness in other words for the highest rainfall intensity values the retarding effect of velocity due to rainfall impact is dominant respect to that due to bed roughness the data analysis showed that neglecting the rainfall effect the calculated darcy weisbach friction factor eq 17 is overestimated for both the calibrating and testing datasets highlighting the dependence of flow resistance on rei in particular flow resistance increases for increasing rei and rainfall intensity accordingly this result can be physically justified taking into account that the laboratory runs by emmett 1970 are all characterized by a laminar flow regime 5 re 327 and yoon and wenzel 1971 carried out measurements with re 2000 for 75 of the investigated overland flows fig 2 in other words emmett 1970 and yoon and wenzel 1971 investigated hydraulic conditions in which the retarding effects of rainfall cannot be neglected 5 2 calibrating and testing the overland flow resistance law by field data for the field data the relationship between the reynolds number and the darcy weisbach friction factor fig 7 is poorly in agreement with previous results for rill flows by nearing et al 1997 peng et al 2015 and di stefano et al 2017 for eroding rills nearing et al 1997 suggested that flow reynolds number is not an appropriate predictor of hydraulic friction because erosion processes cause form roughness in the rill and established that the relationship f re is primarily influenced by slope gradient s the experiments by peng et al 2015 confirmed that a power relationship can be used to fit the pairs f re and this correlation varied with slope gradient the pairs re f measured by di stefano et al 2017 confirmed that the darcy weisbach friction factor tends to decrease as re increases and an increasing trend of f with slope can be detected they concluded that the poor correlation f re suggests that in agreement with nearing et al 1997 re is not a unique predictor of hydraulic roughness in rills the proposed approach guaranteed a very reliable estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor for both calibrating and testing dataset confirming that the flow resistance increases with rainfall intensity even if coupling eq 8 with eq 18 or eq 13 gives comparable f estimates eq 13 with the a values obtained for each geographical area allows taking into account the effect of different vegetation types the range of a is quite narrow 0 3243 0 3892 confirming for a wider range of s re and f the findings by nicosia et al 2020c that a does not change significantly with different types of vegetation for the laminar flow regime in fact in a laminar flow regime the effect of roughness due to different types of vegetation on flow resistance is scarcely appreciable moreover the a value 0 3255 obtained for the nf geographical area is very close to that 0 3215 nicosia et al 2020c related to the perennial grass vegetation type by polyakov et al 2018 as a consequence of comparable vegetation between the two cases 6 conclusions overland flow data by emmett 1970 obtained by rainfall simulation experiments carried out in laboratory and field condition were used to test a theoretical flow resistance law deduced by applying the Ï theorem of dimensional analysis and self similarity theory the available laboratory measurements divided into two datasets were used to calibrate and test the theoretical relationship between the velocity profile parameter Î³v the bed slope the flow froude number and the rain reynolds number the data by yoon and wenzel 1971 obtained on a smooth bed were added to the testing dataset to evaluate the applicability of the equation for a different bed roughness the consequent theoretical flow resistance law gave low estimate errors of the darcy weisbach friction factor for the rough bed condition and limited to the highest rainfall intensities for the smooth bed one instead for the lowest values 12 7 and 31 75 mm h 1 the influence of the bed roughness was not negligible and the estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor for a smooth bed condition was unreliable the data analysis showed that neglecting the rainfall effect the calculated darcy weisbach friction factor eq 17 is overestimated for both the calibrating and testing datasets confirming the dependence of flow resistance on rei in particular flow resistance increases for increasing rei and rainfall intensity accordingly the equation calibrated by field data gave a very good estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor for both the calibration and testing dataset the a coefficient values obtained confirmed that in a laminar flow regime the effect of roughness due to different types of vegetation on flow resistance is scarcely appreciable the results obtained by laboratory and field data agree with the conclusion suggested by yoon and wenzel 1971 that for flow reynolds number 2000 flow resistance increases with rainfall intensity the following conclusions can be deduced by the developed analysis for laboratory data when the rainfall intensity is low the bed roughness effect is dominant and cannot be neglected for laboratory data when the rainfall intensities are high the increased contribution of rainfall to total flow resistance compared to that due to bed roughness leads to the applicability of a single equation for both smooth and rough beds for laboratory data neglecting the rainfall effect the calculated darcy weisbach friction factor eq 17 is overestimated for both the calibrating and testing datasets for field data the estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor by eq 8 coupled with eq 13 with the a values obtained for each geographical area allows taking into account the effect of different vegetation types new experiments with different flow regime conditions should be carried out to study overland flow with different rainfall and surface roughness conditions and to evaluate the contribution of the vegetation to flow resistance credit authorship

4118,water use efficiency wue measures the trade off between carbon gain and water loss and is an important link between the carbon and water cycles a better understanding of spatiotemporal variation in wue and its controlling factors will help to improve ecosystem management for adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climatic change we examined the spatiotemporal variations of wue and its controlling factors for five bioclimatic zones and four land covers for 1982 2014 in the tekeze river basin in northern ethiopia we quantified mean annual and seasonal net primary productivity npp actual evapotranspiration eta and wue npp eta during this period and found that each increased significantly npp eta and therefore wue varied spatially amongst the bioclimatic zones and land covers but with different patterns wue was higher in semi arid than humid zones spatiotemporal changes in temperature and precipitation could be important controls on npp and eta variations and therefore wue mild and severe droughts in the southern regions of the basin decreased annual wue and moderate and extreme droughts slightly increased it indicating that the measure of environmental rehabilitation implemented since the 1980s have increased npp in these regions despite the water stress caused by frequent droughts the variability of wue was primarily controlled by climatic change and human activity the latter dominant since the 2000s ecological restoration and measures for conserving soil and water could substantially increase the vegetation productivity of this region and be a viable management strategy to both adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change keywords water use efficiency primary productivity ecosystem model climatic factor drought ethiopia 1 introduction climate change affects natural ecosystems in many regions of the world particularly where dryland ecosystems are sensitive to disturbances due to water shortages other processes such as land use land cover changes and atmospheric composition tropospheric ozone atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 level and nitrogen deposition interact with climate change and influence the carbon and water cycles of ecosystems niu et al 2008 yu et al 2008 ecosystem water use efficiency wue is defined as the ratio of carbon assimilation to water loss which we quantified as the ratio of net primary productivity npp to actual evapotranspiration eta keenan et al 2013 beer et al 2007 fischer and turner 1978 wue is an important physiological parameter for quantifying the trade off between carbon gain and water loss and is an essential concept for studying metabolism and energy flow in terrestrial ecosystems tang et al 2014 beer et al 2009 hu et al 2008 wue is thus an important indicator of climate change and ecosystem degradation because it helps to improve our understanding of carbon and water cycles under changing environments lu and zhuang 2010 hogg 1994 advances in observational techniques and modelling have provided a better understanding of wue and its interactions with environmental factors at different temporal e g daily monthly and annual and spatial e g local regional and global scales yang et al 2016 brÃ¼mmer et al 2012 niu et al 2011 medrano et al 2009 meeting the requirements of large scale studies of trade offs between carbon and water however remains challenging liu et al 2015 because factors such as climate landform and land cover often spatially interact which complicates generalisation from the site level to larger scales also few observation sites e g for eddy covariance have been established and are often only in specific regions and are therefore difficult to compare between biomes or for understanding local spatiotemporal patterns ecosystem models based on processes and remote sensing have recently been used to improve our understanding of the complex carbon water interactions and wue functioning under changing environments for longer periods and at regional to continental scales huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 a recent global scale analysis of wue its spatiotemporal distribution and changes by tang et al 2014 provided data from

xia et al 2015 the effect of a climatic variable on wue may vary according to the vegetation type or water condition ponce campos et al 2013 tian et al 2010 wue for wetland and cropland decreases as precipitation increases and wue for shrubland and grassland ecosystems increases with precipitation tian et al 2010 tian et al 2010 found that wue in terrestrial ecosystems in the southern usa for 1895 2007 increased much faster than npp in regions with lower than higher precipitation ponce campos et al 2013 however found that wue tended to increase from moderate to extreme droughts and decreased under wet conditions at the global scale previous studies have also found that increasing atmospheric co2 levels have significant fertilisation effects by enhancing the terrestrial uptake of co2 and by increasing wue frank et al 2015 van der sleen et al 2015 keenan et al 2013 leakey et al 2009 ainsworth and rogers 2007 adverse effects from an increase in vapor pressure deficits driven by temperature for example however could reduce productivity and increase water loss niu et al 2011 bell et al 2010 feng et al 2016 reported that human activity leading to changes in land use land cover greatly affected wue an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of wue and its potential driving factors can thus help to clarify changes to carbon and water coupling cycles under future environmental conditions cheng et al 2017 niu et al 2011 northern ethiopia is particularly affected by insufficient and highly variable precipitation frequent droughts and land degradation

2006 these measures have noticeably improved vegetation cover and hydro geomorphic processes to various degrees tesfaye et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 but the ecosystems in most areas of the region are still vulnerable due to the adverse and changing environmental conditions this vulnerability was demonstrated by the recent drought of 2015 2016 induced by el niÃ±o that affected an estimated 10 2 million people in the drought prone areas of ethiopia fews net 2016 unicef 2015 rehabilitation programmes in dryland areas create potentially conflicting demands for water between ecosystems and humans because both plants and humans depend on similar water sources in these areas feng et al 2016 the effectiveness and consequences of rehabilitation programmes on vegetation productivity can also be highly variable across bioclimatic zones for example the vegetation has improved substantially in dryland areas of northern ethiopia but the effectiveness of vegetation restoration has been limited in the humid areas gebremicael et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015a nyssen et al 2010 exploring the spatial distribution trends of variation and factors controlling wue in this

climatic factors for all of ethiopia e g khalifa et al 2018 and northern ethiopia e g teferi 2015 even these studies were either at national or larger basin scales which strongly limited our understanding of variability at local scale for example khalifa et al 2018 found that ecosystem wue in sudan and ethiopia for 2000 2013 responded negatively to temperature but positively to increasing precipitation but the results were not significant for most land covers and that correlations between annual wue and drought conditions were strongest for most land covers in ethiopia teferi 2015 also observed that wue in the basin of the upper blue nile abay river in ethiopia for 1982 2006 was positively and significantly correlated with maximum temperature and vapour pressure deficit in the dry sub humid and humid zones but was not correlated with these factors in semi arid zones these findings may suggest that the factors controlling wue differ amongst land covers and bioclimatic zones khalifa et al 2018 further reported that wue during 2000 2013 showed a decreasing trend for all land covers in ethiopia but teferi 2015 reported that the responses of wue varied amongst land covers a synthesis by xue et al 2015 also identified an increasing trend in wue for most land covers at the global level for 2000 2013 these discrepancies may therefore mislead or impede the responses of options to adapt to a changing climate the differences in these findings however may be partly due to the different spatiotemporal scales differences in the input data used methods and study regions these differences also indicate the need for in depth investigations of the spatiotemporal variability and driving factors of wue at different scales of space and time in the region we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of annual and seasonal wue in the dry biogeophysical environment of northern ethiopia for 1982 2014 our objectives were to 1 assess the spatiotemporal patterns of npp eta and wue in the tekeze river basin and its nine sub basins 2 determine the variability of wue over various bioclimatic zones and land covers and 3 analyse the roles of climatic factors temperature precipitation and solar radiation in controlling the variation and sensitivity of wue in response to drought as represented by the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei achieving these objectives could substantially enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal variability and driving forces of wue first this study focused on the spatiotemporal variability of wue in small basins and sub basins 3751 65541 km2 at annual and seasonal scales in the semi arid areas of northern ethiopia previous studies focused on larger basins or national levels and only annually thus providing little insight for local scales and seasons second we investigated the relationships of annual and seasonal variability in wue with means and variations of climatic factors we also identified the climatic variables that best accounted for the variations in wue across land covers and bioclimatic zones previous analyses that have examined the relationship between variation in wue and climatic indices have typically used annual means for wue and climatic factors which may provide conflicting results for inter annual deviations in wue and corresponding anomalies in mean climatic factors mohamed et al 2004 third we systematically assessed the relationship of wue variability with human activity particularly to differentiate the effects of climatic factors across periods previous studies however have not fully determined how the variations in wue depended on the drivers of changes in climate and land use 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tekeze river basin fig 1 is one of twelve major river basins in ethiopia the basin is in the drylands of northern ethiopia between latitudes 12 30 21 14 05 17 n and longitudes 37 36 42 39 42 16 e it has an approximate area of 66 541 km2 and minimum maximum and average elevations of 481 4453 and 1740 m a s l respectively the climate is highly variable due to contrasting topographical and climatic factors tesfaye et al 2019 mccartney and girma 2012 tekeze river basin has three distinct seasons with different precipitation patterns a dry winter from october to february dry season a pre monsoon hot season from march to may small rainy season and a rainy monsoon season from june to september rainy season during which approximately 80 of the field crops are grown average annual precipitation for 1961 2014 varied from 409 mm in the northeast to 1300 mm in the highlands in the southwest with a mean of 852 mm tesfaye et al 2019 annual precipitation is highly variable with a coefficient of variation cv ranging from 0 5 in the highlands to 0 1 in the lowlands average annual air temperatures range from 15 c in the southern highlands to 29 c in the northwestern lowlands with an average of 19 7 c for the basin tesfaye et al 2019 the highly variable topography and the variable air temperature and precipitation lead to different bioclimatic zones within the basin the study area comprises five zones following the ethiopian agro ecological classification proposed by hurni 1998 and moa 1998 hot semi arid lowlands beriha 1300 m a s l with mean annual temperatures 28 c warm semi arid lowlands kolla 1300 1800 m a s l with mean annual temperatures of 20 28 c tepid sub humid highlands weyna dega 1800 2400 m a s l with mean annual temperatures of 16 20 c cool humid highlands dega 2400 3200 m a s l with mean annual temperatures of 6 16 c and cold humid highlands wurch 3200 m a s l with mean annual temperatures 6 c fig 1b and a 1 the dominant land covers are cropland 63 4 shrubland 16 grassland 13 6 and woodland 6 6 mdc12q1 product most cropland and shrubland are in the highlands fig 1c and d 1 and the lowlands are mainly covered by woodland and grassland some native forests and tree plantations are in elevated areas with the steepest slopes 35 the dominant soil types are leptosol cambisol vertisol and luvisol fao 1998 2 2 data sources and processing we estimated wue and its responses to climatic factors using climatic datasets remotely sensed data and model outputs table 1 model calculations and output mapping were conducted using arcgis 10 4 the procedure we followed to calculate wue is depicted in fig 2 all data layers were re projected to the transverse mercator projection based on the wgs 84 datum and or resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 km prior to analysis 2 2 1 ndvi and land cover data we calculated wue using spatial datasets from different sources ndvi data were obtained from the global inventory monitoring and modelling studies gimms version g data product tucker et al 2005 for 1982 2006 with an original spatial resolution of 8 km and a temporal resolution of 15 days radiation correction geometric correction and cloud filtering were applied during the preparation of this dataset to minimise various effects such as loss of calibration orbital drift and volcanic eruptions the modis mod13q1 16 day composite ndvi data at a spatial resolution of 250 m huete et al 2002 were included to extend the data to 2001 2014 these data were subjected to format conversion reprojection spatial splicing and resampling to match the spatial and temporal resolutions of the gimms ndvi land cover and climatic data the original gimms 15 day and modis 16 day ndvi composite data were aggregated to monthly data using a maximum value composite mvc approach to further reduce the influence of clouds holben 1986 both the gimms and modis ndvi data were smoothed and filtered using spector grant filtering to reduce noise in the ndvi datasets and to remove most contamination of the ndvi signals due to residual cloud cover and atmospheric haze remaining after the mvc processing the gimms and modis ndvi datasets were subsequently resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 km using a bilinear interpolation algorithm and majority rule respectively these two types of ndvi data are acquired using different sensors so comparing these data for the overlapping period 2001 2006 72 months is important correlation analyses were performed between monthly gimms and modis ndvi datasets the results indicated good agreement with a correlation coefficient of 0 86 p 0 001 so these datasets were reliable at the basin scale direct per pixel comparisons between the gimms and modis ndvi datasets were also conducted using pixel wise linear regression analysis with an average coefficient of determination r 2 for all pixels of 0 72 p 0 001 the modis ndvi data for 2001 2014 were interpolated and reconstructed for applying ndvi time series for 1982 2014 annual land cover maps spatial resolution of 500 m for 2001 2012 were acquired from the mcd12q1 modis land use product friedl et al 2010 for determining changes in land cover the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar and the maximal light use efficiency lue needed as input to the carnegie ames stanford approach casa ecosystem model the mcd12q1 data product was publicly released in 2004 and has been substantially revised to reduce classification error by introducing various approaches such as algorithm inputs including spectral and temporal information and land surface temperature lst using data for three intervening years the product however still has problems associated with classifying similar land covers friedl et al 2010 we grouped the classification results of the mcd12q1 land cover data using the classification international geosphere bio sphere programme loveland and belward 1997 based on prior knowledge of the study area previous studies tesfaye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015b and information from google earth the original eight types of land cover were combined into four woodland represent mixed forest woody savannas and savannas shrubland represent closed shrublands and open shrublands grassland represent grasslands and cropland represent croplands and cropland natural vegetation mosaic appendix d data for these land covers with spatial resolutions of 500 m were then aggregated to a resolutions of 1 km using majority aggregation channan et al 2014 2 2 2 climatic data climatic data air temperature and precipitation were obtained from 92 stations of ethiopian national meteorological agency the data from each station were generally controlled for quality to identify missing and non homogeneous data climatic data were analysed using visual inspection data consistency tests between station or regression approaches and homogenisation techniques following general wmo guidelines wmo 2011 2018 we only used data from stations with 10 missing daily data seleshi and zanke 2004 to ensure data continuity and integrity tables b 1 and c 1 finally precipitation data from 51 stations and air temperature data from 43 stations within and surrounding the basin were used see fig 1 the datasets covered daily and monthly data for 1982 2014 this study period and the 51 stations were selected to ensure the availability of data with relatively good quality and continuous records of daily and monthly climate the data gaps for the stations were filled using the weighted correlation of daily data from the nearest neighbouring stations as described in detail by woldesenbet et al 2017a and applied in the region woldesenbet et al 2017b korecha and barnston 2007 seleshi and camberlin 2006 and elsewhere beguerÃ­a et al 2019 teegavarapu et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2010 we selected the nearest neighbouring stations within a 100 km and used a threshold of kendall rank correlation tau of 0 25 tables c 2 and c 3 weighting factors were adopted after identifying good correlations p 0 0001 between neighbouring stations that both had data table c 4 daily data recorded as zero precipitation at both stations were omitted from the correlation analysis to avoid a false increase in kendall s tau due to coincident long dry periods woldesenbet et al 2017a a minimum of two and a maximum of four stations were used in the regression equation if more than four stations were within 100 km the four with the best correlations were selected after the missing data for the stations were filled data series for each stations were subjected to homogeneity tests multiple analysis of series for homogenization mash developed at the hungarian meteorological service szentimrey 2011 szentimrey 2008 szentimrey 1999 was used to homogenise daily air temperatures and precipitation for 1982 2014 detailed information for controlling the quality of the climatic data gap filling and homogenisation is provided in a supplementary document appendix c each climatic variable in and around the basin was spatially interpolated using co kriging interpolation wu and li 2013 goovaerts 1997 at a spatial resolution of 1 km to obtain values for the sub basins co kriging interpolation is considered suitable to represent areal characteristics of air temperature and precipitation in the tekeze river basin due to the limited number of stations and complex topography of northern ethiopia the interpolation of the unevenly distributed and sparse gauge stations over the complex topography of the basin however may also introduce uncertainties during modelling nyssen et al 2005 and eklundh and pilesjÃ¶ 1990 reported that elevation slope and aspect were the main topographic variables affecting the spatial distributions of climatic variables such as air temperature precipitation and total solar radiation we therefore used these topographic variables as co variates for interpolating the climatic variables and used latitude and longitude as independent variables attorre et al 2007 a digital elevation model at a resolution of 30 m was obtained from the aster gdem website table 1 two climatic datasets interpolated climate datasets with and without topographic factors were compared and validated with the observed dataset on a monthly time scale for 2010 2014 table c 5 the periods for this comparison were selected based on the quality of the data we concluded that the correlation between the estimated and observed datasets was strong so the estimated datasets were deemed reliable fig c 1 and table c 5 monthly data for total solar radiation for 1982 2014 at a grid spacing of 0 5 were obtained from the department of energy doe ii reanalysis dataset of the national centre for environmental prediction zhao and running 2010 and resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 km using bilinear interpolation appendix c 5 2 2 3 eta data and drought index the eta dataset for 1982 2014 was developed from meteorological and modis eta data fig a 2 the fao penman monteith method for limited data allen et al 1998 provided the reference et due to the lack of data for all required climatic inputs this method estimates other variables such as missing wind speed by adopting the global average wind speed or using an average wind speed at the neighbouring meteorological stations solar radiation using observed temperature and actual vapor pressure using the observed minimum air temperature when relative air humidity was not available modis eta datasets monthly mod16a2 for the nile basin with a spatial resolution of 1 km for 2001 2014 were acquired from the website of the numerical terra dynamic simulation group at the university of montana table 1 note that the period 2001 2014 was selected for eta data due to the incomplete availability of modis data for 2000 fensholt and proud 2012 ganguly et al 2010 this modis et product was developed using an improved algorithm for remote sensed et mu et al 2011 the original mod16 algorithm mu et al 2007 was developed based on the penman monteith et model monteith 1965 which uses reanalysed meteorological data and vegetation property dynamics including land cover leaf area index and albedo to estimate eta the improved mod16 algorithm uses ndvi the enhanced vegetation index and terra modis daytime lst in addition to the inputs in the previous global mod16 et algorithm for the regional and global mapping and monitoring of et mu et al 2011 mu et al 2007 the terrestrial evapotranspiration product for the nile basin was validated by mu et al 2013 using data from 46 eddy flux towers and have been used to estimate eta in the nile basin with satisfactory accuracy previous studies in northern ethiopia have used mod16 et as an estimate of eta e g alemu et al 2014 sun et al 2011 this product could not be validated with observations due to the lack of ground measurements of eta the fao penman monteith estimates of reference et were converted to eta using per pixel correlations between overlapping years of the two datasets reference et and modis eta the per pixel strength of the linear association between the two sets of data was determined by estimating the correlation coefficient for the overlapping 14 year time series of monthly observations 2001 2014 the slope and intercept of the per pixel regression were used for converting the reference et to eta for 1982 2014 the average per pixel correlation coefficient and coefficients of determination were 0 59 and 0 51 p 0 01 respectively the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a widely used indictor of drought in hydrological ecological and agricultural studies vicente serrano et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2010 was adopted to assess wue response to drought appendix e estimates were obtained using the difference between monthly precipitation and potential et this difference represents a simple meteorological water balance monthly differences were aggregated for 1982 2014 and fitted to a probability distribution function for calculating spei beguerÃ­a et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2010 positive and negative speis indicate conditions above wetter and below drier normal respectively monthly spei data at a time scales of 1 3 6 9 and 12 months were used to examine the effects of drought on wue for 1982 2014 over the bioclimatic zones and land covers belayneh et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2012 spei has also been used to indicate and characterise droughts including duration start and end dates magnitude and severity see appendix e a drought begins when spei is 1 0 and ends when spei becomes positive again the duration of a drought was defined as the period when spei was 1 0 the magnitude a drought corresponded to the accumulated precipitation deficit during the drought and the quotient of this accumulated deficit volume over the drought period was the mean intensity drought severity was estimated based on the intensity and duration of the drought drought severity was classified into four categories mild moderate severe and extreme mckee et al 1993 based on the 12 month speis to the end of december see table e 1 this helped to identify longer dry periods vicente serrano 2006 when the ecohydrological processes in this semi arid region mostly respond to spei12 awange et al 2016 belayneh et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2012 2 3 data analysis wue was defined as the ratio of npp to eta ponce campos et al 2013 and was estimated for 1982 2014 for each grid cell fig 2 we then assessed the spatiotemporal patterns of wue and their responses to climatic variables using nine sub basins five bioclimatic zones and four land covers figs a 1 and d 1 monthly wue was averaged for the entire basin and for each sub basin bioclimatic zone and land cover to produce spatially averaged time series data we further illustrated the characteristics of variation in wue for relatively long time series by calculating the patterns of annual and seasonal wue for the 33 year study period in each pixel using the mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and pettitt pettitt 1979 tests which have been frequently used in similar studies the mann kendall test analyses the trend in a long term sequence appendix f 1 pettitt tests were also used to identify the changing points of the trends in the time series appendix f 2 trend free pre whitening described by yue et al 2003 was used prior to the trend analysis to avoid the effect of serial correlation on the test results a kruskal wallis non parametric method was used with the post hoc wilcoxon pairs comparison test to identify significant differences of wue npp and eta amongst the bioclimatic zones and land covers the relationships of wue with air temperature precipitation solar radiation and spei were investigated using pearson correlation we assumed that a significant correlation between the coefficients of variation cvs for wue and the climatic factors indicated that the seasonal or inter annual variability of wue could be attributed to spatial and temporal fluctuations of the climatic factors gong et al 2012 fang et al 2001 correlations were considered significant at p 0 05 the cv for a variable was defined as the ratio of its standard deviation to its mean the air temperature data in degrees celsius were first transformed to absolute temperatures because cvs are meaningful only for data measured as a ratios zar 1999 we fitted generalised linear models glms for the bioclimatic zones and land covers to determine the relative contributions of climatic variables to the variations in annual and seasonal wue tables b 2 b 5 the larger the relative contribution the more the relevant the variable all variables were normalised by the mean of the time series prior to the glm analysis we quantitatively analysed the effects of climatic variability and human activity on wue using linear regression applied to the annual wue series data during the two periods identified by the pettitt test tables b 6 and b 7 annual series of wue data for the first period i e prior to an abrupt change in wue following extensive practices of land management were used as baselines for comparison with the second period i e after an abrupt change in wue wue was therefore linearly regressed as a function of precipitation and wue in the two periods and was then analysed and compared 2 4 model parameterisation and validation the casa ecosystem model is a process based light use efficiency lue model that estimates npp for each pixel at monthly intervals potter et al 2009 yu et al 2009 potter et al 1993 npp in casa is estimated as the product of the amount of photosynthetically active radiation apar

vegetation survey conducted in 202 working plots of 20 20 m2 for measurements of trees and shrubs and of 2 2 m2 for measurements of grass production across the basin see appendix g for details harvesting and non harvesting methods were used to estimate biomass hairiah et al 2010 gibbs et al 2007 allometric regression models for mixed species in northern ethiopia proposed by mokria et al 2018 ubuy et al 2018 and gidey et al 2013 were applied to estimate aboveground biomass agb of trees and shrubs ground cover biomasses were estimated by harvesting aboveground npp was estimated using increases in agb from periodic measurements of biomass from 2016 to 2018 agb npp was estimated by multiplying agb by the default ipcc carbon fraction value of 0 47 ipcc 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variability of wue the spatial variation and distribution of mean annual npp eta and wue for 1982 2014 are presented in figs 3 and 4 npp was generally high in the west and low in the east and differed significantly between the sub basins annually and seasonally tables 2 and b 8 the average annual total npp from the entire basin during the study period 1982 2014 was approximately 11 84 106 t c the mean annual npp ranged between 92 4 and 439 6 g c m2 in western regions including zarema sibta and humera where woodland cover was more abundant and high air temperatures and precipitation both contributed to high vegetation growth npp was lower in eastern regions such as worie geba and tserare where it ranged from 55 2 to 248 4 g c m2 see fig 1a for the sub basins these regions were characterised by dry climatic conditions with average annual precipitation for 1961 2014 ranging from 409 to 767 mm a short growing season 2 3 months and cropland and sparse shrub vegetation as the dominant land covers figs a 3 and d 1 npp in the remaining regions including southern tekeze basin belesa gilgel tekeze and mount ras dejen ranged between 57 6 and 280 8 g c m2 mean annual npp varied substantially regionally fig 3d particularly in the south but less in the north eta varied spatially across the basin both annually and for the rainy season table 2 and table b 8 for the small rainy season and the dry season average annual eta was approximately 457 2 mm but eta decreased as altitude increased fig 3b very consistent with the changes in both air temperature and precipitation fig a 3 eta was highest in the zarema and humera sub basins in the warm and humid lowland region of the basin and was lowest in the highlands of the upper region eta tended to increase significantly over the 33 year period during the small rainy season and the dry season in most sub basins p 0 05 fig 4b the spatial variability of wue for 1982 2014 depended on the magnitudes and patterns of npp and eta tables 2 and b 8 annual and seasonal wue differed significantly amongst most sub basins fig 3 average annual wue ranged from 0 07 to 0 91 g c mm m2 with an average of 0 4 g c mm m2 average annual wue was lower than the value of 0 74 g c mm m2 for ethiopia for 2000 2013 reported by khalifa et al 2018 most of the northern regions of the country are degraded barren or sparsely vegetated and typically have lower wues than the vegetated areas in the central and western regions wue was highest in the central and southern regions and was generally lowest in the eastern region fig 3 mean annual npp was higher in the northwest than the south and annual wue was lower in most parts of the northwest where eta was highest indicating that both vegetation type and water availability affected wue the spatial pattern of annual wue was generally positively correlated with the spatial patterns of precipitation and vegetation type figs a 3 and d 1 wue increased significantly in all seasons and sub basins over the 33 year period fig 4c wue cv was highest 0 73 mostly in the south fig 3f and lowest in areas dominated by cropland with good hydrothermal conditions vegetation coverage and the response of npp varied across the region due to spatial heterogeneity and changes in environmental factors such as land cover tesfaye et al 2019 gebremicael et al 2018 gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 interventions such as ecological restoration and measures to conserve soil and water are key factors affecting vegetation coverage and are amongst the most important factors controlling the response of npp local human activity affects vegetation coverage nyssen et al 2010 girmay et al 2009 haregeweyn et al 2006 and in our study led to coincident increases in npp and wue fig 4 with increasing interventions during the study period 3 2 temporal variability of wue mean annual npp for 1982 2014 was 178 g c m2 y ranging from 99 6 g c m2 y in 1988 to 276 g c m2 y in 2014 fig 4d annual npp thus varied substantially between years but tended to increase significantly during this period in the basin and sub basins figs 3 and 4 the temporal trends of npp shifted upwards in all sub basins and all seasons around 2000 fig 4a and tables b 6 and b 7 eta at the basin scale and in most sub basins tended to increase significantly during the small rainy season and the dry season for 1982 2014 and tended to decrease in the rainy season but not significantly fig 4 and tables 2 and b 8 annual eta for the entire basin peaked at 479 1 mm in 2009 and was lowest at 440 2 mm in 1999 wue in each sub basin tended to increase significantly by an average of 0 01 g c mm m2 y fig 4 area averaged wue temporally ranged from 0 23 g c mm m2 in 1994 to 0 62 g c mm m2 in 2014 with an average of 0 41 g c mm m2 fig 3f and 4 indicating that about 0 41 g of co2 was assimilated for vegetation growth for every millimetre of water lost by evapotranspiration wue was relatively stable before the 2000 s in most sub basins fig a 4 and then increased with substantial inter annual fluctuation tables b 6 and b 7 the corresponding tendency of npp to significantly increase and eta to be more stable may indicate that wue was influenced more by npp than eta the highest npp and wue around 2000 may be closely associated with the high precipitation during the same year tesfaye et al 2019 tesfaye et al 2017 pan et al 2015 and the intensive land management began to have an effect mostly in the upper reaches of the basin gebremicael et al 2018 fenta et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 ecosystem productivity is more sensitive to changing hydro climatic conditions in semi arid and sub humid ecosystems suggesting a high sensitivity of wue to water availability in these regions yang et al 2016 responses in these semi arid and dry sub humid ecosystems were smaller for eta than npp even though eta increased during the year concurrently with high water availability leading to a higher wue in wetter years and areas under ecological restoration figs 3 and 4 the dynamics of wue have also been dominated by the variation of npp in other countries was also observed for areas outside ethiopia zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2010 the temporal trends in npp indicated that npp was relatively low in the 1980 s and 1990 s due to significant reductions in 1983 85 1987 1988 1991 92 1993 94 1997 98 and 1999 induced by drought edossa et al 2010 unesco 2004 these periods of drought were followed by the recovery of npp during the 2000 s zhao and running 2010 when increased precipitation greatly increased npp in most parts of the basin abdi et al 2016 gebrehiwot et al 2011 numerous ecological restoration and soil and water conservation measures have been implemented in northern ethiopia since the 1980 s to increase npp using physical measures such as the construction of terraces and dams and biological measures such as exclosures closed degraded areas and protected from livestock and human intervention to enable the vegetation to recover and then planting seedlings and sowing grasses in the exclosures these measures have greatly improved vegetation coverage nyssen et al 2015 alemayehu et al 2009 favourably altered the hydrology by increasing infiltration following vegetation recovery taye et al 2013 nyssen et al 2010 haregeweyn et al 2006 and increased npp and wue 3 3 wue variability between bioclimatic zones annual and seasonal npp eta and wue were spatiotemporally variable in the bioclimatic zones for 1982 2014 fig 5 and table 2 annual and seasonal npp tended to increase significantly in each bioclimatic zone figs 5 and a 5 around 2000 tables b 6 and b 7 annual npp was significantly higher in the hot semi arid zone than the other bioclimatic zones table 2 p 0 05 npp in the hot semi arid zone 213 6 g c m2 was high mostly in the west where the climate is hot and relatively wet and most of the area received substantial precipitation fig a 3 npp however was mostly low in the tepid sub humid zone 156 24 g c m2 which is mostly in the east where the climate is mild and dry high air temperatures have a two fold effect on the vegetation carbon cycle they can increase the maximum capacity of carbon uptake and alter the phenological phases of the vegetation ito and inatomi 2012 but can also increase transpiration and evaporative loss of soil water which can in turn induce drought that limits photosynthesis and respiration liu et al 2017 this negative effect however can be offset or increased by altered precipitation and hydrological conditions these opposing effects of warming may vary amongst regions with different climatic features terrestrial ecosystems in dryland environments are usually mainly limited by the availability of water increased availability decreases water limitation increases vegetation activity and stimulates both photosynthesis and respiration tian et al 2010 knapp and smith 2001 estimates of aggregated monthly eta for 1982 2014 differed spatially between bioclimatic zones fig 5 the highest total annual eta was 530 7 mm in the hot semi arid zone and 515 9 mm in the cold humid zone which were significantly higher than in the other bioclimatic zones table 2 annual eta was similar in the warm semi arid tepid sub humid cool humid zones at 418 9 406 4 and 464 7 mm respectively table b 9 eta tended to increase significantly in all five bioclimatic zones during the small rainy season and the dry season fig a 5 in contrast eta tended to decrease during the rainy season in all bioclimatic zones but not significantly compared to other seasons annual and seasonal wue increased significantly in each of the five bioclimatic zones fig a 5 due to the increases in npp indicating substantial greening in recent decades attributed to human activity mean annual and rainy season wue differed significantly between the semi arid and humid zones but wue did not differ significantly during the small rainy season and the dry season tables 2 and b 8 the differences and seasonal variations in wue amongst bioclimatic zones may have been determined by both intrinsic biological characteristics and external environmental factors fig a 6 average annual wue in the five bioclimatic zones for 1982 2014 decreased in the order warm semi arid 0 405 g c mm m2 tepid sub humid 0 403 g c mm m2 hot semi arid 0 396 g c mm m2 cool humid 0 375 g c mm m2 cold humid 0 326 g c mm m2 zones table b 9 this order suggests that vegetation in energy limited bioclimatic zones uses water less efficiently than vegetation in water limited bioclimatic zones annual wue increased at rates 0 006 g c mm m2 y for all bioclimatic zones fig 5 wue generally tended to increase in the humid regions with smaller increases in semi arid regions comparably deficient for water resources annual and seasonal wue tended to increase significantly in all regions figs 5 and a 5 particularly during the small rainy season an increase in precipitation in the small rainy season and the dry season often induced a larger increase in npp than eta which increased annual wue precipitation in the rainy season normally corresponds to a decrease in the intensity of incoming solar radiation which is a factor controlling carbon uptake in highland areas increased precipitation can also increase evaporation from soil and the interception of rainwater by the canopy which also contribute to decreases in annual wue yang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 long and short term climatic variations such as the seasonality of precipitation and inter annual precipitation can affect ecosystem productivity and water cycling field et al 1995 water availability is the primary environmental factor in the drier region where vegetation characteristics e g lai are likely to be adapted to dry climates huxman et al 2004 in contrast air temperature is the main driver of variation in ecosystem productivity in humid regions yang et al 2016 because ecosystem functions are driven mostly by energy supply and warming increases vapor pressure deficits and potential transpiration the increase in annual and seasonal air temperatures in northern ethiopia nma 2007 tesfaye et al 2019 when increases in air temperature and water availability were combined in the humid zones reinforced transpiration leading to a positive npp response and thereby implying a higher rate of increase in wue in the humid than the semi arid zones our results consequently indicated a robust intrinsic dependence of wue on bioclimatic zone across all time scales 3 4 wue variability between land covers our results indicated that npp varied across land covers tables 2 and b 8 consistent with previous studies in ethiopia khalifa et al 2018 teferi et al 2015 npp increased for all land covers based on annual and seasonal data for 1982 2014 with the largest increases in woodland 0 82 g c m2 y and cropland 0 36 g c m2 y fig 6 annual npp also increased in grassland 0 32 g c m2 y and shrubland 0 26 g c m2 y npp increased the most in woodland and cropland in the west due to good water availability and the expansion of irrigated cropland in this region eta was spatially variable across the land covers tables 2 and b 8 and was generally highest in woodland and cropland and lowest in shrubland and grassland eta for all land covers except shrubland which is mostly in the highlands increased annually and in most seasons for 1982 2014 figs 6 and a 5 average annual precipitation at the basin scale varied little during the entire period tesfaye et al 2019 but eta tended to both increase and decrease implying that the rate of change of eta may not be consistent with that of precipitation and that other factors such as vegetation characteristics and human intervention may play a role in the hydrological balance and control the rate of eta wue differed significantly between land covers table 2 p 0 05 average wue for the four land covers generally decreased in the order woodland 0 495 g c mm m2 cropland 0 412 g c mm m2 grassland 0 393 g c mm m2 shrubland 0 383 g c mm m2 table b 10 the differences in wue between the land covers were influenced by changes in both npp and eta wue differed significantly between woodland and the other land covers because npp and eta varied significantly during 1982 2014 figs 6 and a 5 the significant decrease in eta for shrubland was compensated by the larger increase in npp fig 6d the increase in wue p 0 05 was therefore significant in shrubland fig 6f wue was generally higher in woodland than cropland and grassland suggesting that woodland ecosystems used the available water more efficiently by accessing the large area of the rooting zone these results are consistent with those reported by khalifa et al 2018 and teferi 2015 who indicated that annual wue was higher in woodland and cropland than grassland zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 and tian et al 2010 also reported that wue varied with land cover due to differences in carbon uptake and water consumption afforested and ecologically restored areas have thus become important carbon sinks due to their high capacity to sequester carbon per unit water consumed wue of the land covers increased greatly after the implementation of environmental rehabilitation and schemes for water harvesting started in the 1980s with the trend of increasing wue amongst these land covers controlled mainly by the higher npp during the 33 year period fig 6i previous studies on the effects of environmental rehabilitation in the basin tesfaye et al 2019 gebremicael et al 2018 gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 reported that ecological restoration and soil and water conservation measures were important for increasing the sustainability of land and water resources 3 5 co variation of wue and climatic variables in the bioclimatic zones the correlations between the means and cvs for wue for the five bioclimatic zones and the climatic variables are shown in fig 7 and tables b 11 and b 12 the mean annual small rainy season and dry season wues were positively correlated with precipitation air temperature and solar radiation in contrast wue was negatively correlated with maximum air temperature and solar radiation mostly in the rainy season the cvs of wue annually and during the rainy and small rainy seasons were mostly positively correlated with the cvs of precipitation air temperature and solar radiation fig 7 the cvs of annual wue however were negatively correlated with the cvs of precipitation for all bioclimatic zones most of the wue cvs in the small rainy season and the dry season were negatively correlated with the cvs of maximum and mean air temperatures the wue cvs were significantly negatively correlated with the maximum air temperature cvs mostly annually and in the small rainy season and the dry season for most bioclimatic zones highlighting the role of warming in the inter annual and seasonal variation of wue in the basin in contrast the wue cvs were generally significantly positively correlated with the maximum air temperature cvs in the rainy season for most bioclimatic zones the glm analyses further confirmed that variations in maximum air temperature alone explained approximately 1 9 of the variation in wue annually and seasonally fig 8 the variations in minimum and mean air temperatures also contributed little to the variation of wue the significant spatial and temporal differences in the correlations between wue and air temperature may mainly be attributed to the complicated mechanism of responses of wue to air temperature wue increases with air temperature when the air temperature is lower than optimal for photosynthesis and varies much more intricately when the air temperature is below a particular threshold and the actual wue is determined by the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration zhang et al 2016 keenan et al 2013 the wue cvs were significantly positively correlated with the precipitation cvs for most seasons fig 7 the cvs for annual wue and precipitation however were negatively correlated in all bioclimatic zones the correlations between the cvs of wue and precipitation were generally lower in humid regions and higher in semi arid regions precipitation and its influence on wue varied with latitude and altitude indicating that the annual and seasonal variation in wue was due to regional precipitation zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 ito and inatomi 2012 the glm analyses notably found that precipitation dominated other climatic variables and played a dominant role in regulating the variations in ecosystem wue and precipitation alone accounted for 1 17 of the variation in wue annually and seasonally fig 8 precipitation can directly affect wue and indirectly affect the characteristics of the vegetation such as composition structure and density which also affect wue feng et al 2013 engelbrecht et al 2007 ludwig et al 2005 previous studies in the blue nile river basin adjacent to the tekeze river basin found that wues were significantly and positively correlated with rainfall and air temperature in the humid zones and significantly negatively correlated with maximum air temperature and vapour pressure deficit in the semi arid zones teferi 2015 in addition to the individual effects we also examined the interactive effects of the climatic variables on wue amongst the bioclimatic zones fig 8 precipitation and maximum air temperature had a significant two way interactive effect on wue negative annually and in the dry season and precipitation and solar radiation had a significant two way interactive effect positive annually and seasonally the interactions of precipitation with minimum and mean air temperatures were also negative in the dry season but their influence was marginal for the variation of wue similarly three way interactions of precipitation maximum air temperature and solar radiation were significant and elicited responses of wue in the small rainy season positive and the dry season negative variation in wue amongst the bioclimatic zones was also positively affected by the interaction of precipitation mean air temperature and solar radiation annually and in the dry season the interaction between precipitation and air temperature was negative because the limited water availability was exacerbated by the negative effects of warming which may indicate an additional indirect effect of air temperature on wue by the water balance an increase in air temperature lead to higher evapotranspiration and lower wue the positive interactive effect between precipitation and solar radiation indicated that the positive effects of water availability and solar radiation were stronger when combined we suggest that increases in solar radiation due to declining cloud cover in areas with limited radiation such as cool and cold humid areas mostly at higher altitudes may be partly attributed to the positive interactive effect of precipitation and solar radiation nemani et al 2003 many other factors such as soil and water conservation and ecological restoration measures however may complicate the determination of the co variation between the climatic variables and wue in this water limited region for example the positive and negative interactive effects of precipitation and air temperature in different seasons were likely caused by contrasting practices of water management e g irrigation was mainly in the upper part of the basin tesfaye et al 2019 fenta et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 3 6 co variation of wue and climatic variables for the land covers wue for woodland shrubland grassland and cropland responded differently to the climatic factors fig 7 and tables b 13 and b 14 annual average wue for most land covers was correlated positively with precipitation and maximum minimum and mean air temperatures and negatively with solar radiation table b 13 mean rainy season wue for shrubland and cropland were negatively correlated with maximum minimum and mean air temperatures mean monthly wue during the small rainy season and the dry season for most of the land covers was characterised by a mixture of positive and negative correlations with air temperature and solar radiation the wue cvs for woodland were significantly negatively correlated with the cvs of precipitation maximum air temperature and solar radiation fig 7 and table b 14 the wue cvs for shrubland and grassland were significantly correlated positively with the cvs of minimum air temperature and negatively with the cvs of precipitation and maximum air temperature the wue cvs for cropland were also significantly correlated positively with the cvs of solar radiation during the rainy season but negatively with the cvs for annual precipitation and dry season maximum air temperature we quantified the relative contributions of the climatic variables and their interactive effects to further explore the variations in wue amongst the land covers fig 8 both the inter annual and seasonal variabilities of air temperature had little effect on the variations in wue amongst land covers compared with the larger contribution of precipitation annually and for most seasons the variability of solar radiation was the most important factor affecting the variation in wue the relative contributions from both the two way and three way interactive effects to the variation in wue were smaller fig 8 luo et al 2008 reported that modelled interactive effects of altered precipitation and warming had little effect on the variations in ecosystem responses in different climatic zones another meta analysis of ecosystem responses to climate change wu et al 2011 found that interactive effects were generally small precipitation air temperature and solar radiation generally modulated the annual and seasonal variation of wue consistent with recent studies khalifa et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 teferi 2015 the effects of the various climatic factors varied amongst the regions and were associated with the bioclimatic zones and land covers tang et al 2014 ito and inatomi 2012 tian et al 2010 the influences of climatic variables on the patterns of wue and the responses of wue to these variables may differ or even be opposite at different spatial local regional or global and temporal seasonal and inter annual scales liu et al 2017 keenan et al 2013 niu et al 2011 the climatic factors had different spatiotemporal patterns and the combined effect of these patterns affected the patterns of npp and eta which in turn led to the different responses of wue noted above the climatic control of npp and eta is along a continuum between either deficient water or warmer air temperature whitley et al 2011 mohamed et al 2004 variations of solar radiation air temperature or water availability that cause variability in npp will lead to changes in canopy conductance and eta beer et al 2009 3 7 effects of drought on wue 1984 85 1987 1988 1991 92 1993 94 1997 98 1999 2001 02 2002 03 and 2009 over the 33 year period were dry to drought years in ethiopia gebrehiwot et al 2011 edossa et al 2010 for example representative mild moderate severe and extreme droughts occurred in basin in 1991 2004 1984 and 2009 respectively figs e 1 and e 2 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of areas affected by droughts of different magnitudes in 1991 mild droughts occurred in most of the north western and eastern parts of the basin where annual wue decreased by up to 69 7 but annual wue increased in some parts of the central region during this period moderate droughts occurred in regions near the geba tserare and humera sub basins where annual wue decreased by up to 55 6 but annual wue increased in the central and southern regions during the same period severe and extreme droughts decreased annual wue by up to 71 4 and 64 6 respectively the responses of wue to drought varied with drought severity the timing of the droughts was partly responsible for these different responses for example mild and moderate droughts began in march and april and ended at the end of june fig e 1 which may have slightly affected ecosystem productivity because this drought only occurred early in the growing season june to september a severe drought began in january temporarily became moderate in the middle of the drought and ended at the end of october which strongly affected ecosystem productivity because this drought occurred during the growing season the 1984 severe drought continued for almost ten months and profoundly affected regional food and ecological security world bank 2006 seleshi and zanke 2004 this drought reduced both npp and eta but mostly npp thereby decreasing wue the negative anomalies in npp gradually increased with a relatively stable eta decreasing ecosystem wue during the drought below the annual mean fig e 3 the 2009 extreme drought began in january and ended at the end of november which had a larger effect on ecosystem productivity the positive anomalies of ecosystem wue during the drought in 2009 mostly occurred throughout the drought the positive anomaly in npp was larger than the positive anomaly in eta in corresponding regions thereby increasing wue during the drought these findings suggest that the overall response of wue was mainly determined by the sensitivity of npp to drought in this region the resistance of ecosystems to drought depends on various factors such as drought conditions vegetation type and human activity isbell et al 2015 ponce campos et al 2013 the diverse responses of wue to droughts in different years could thus be attributed to human activity in the region feng et al 2016 for example an extreme drought 2009 in most regions of the basin did not vary as much as a severe drought 1984 and increased annual wue mostly in the south which was attributed to interventions that increased annual npp human activities in the southern regions such as ecological restoration and extensive soil and water conservation measures were also a dominant factor controlling vegetation growth and the increase in npp in the early period may have partly offset the decrease in wue induced by the higher npp wue was relatively low in the 1980s and 1990s fig 4 due to a significant reduction in npp after a series of droughts edosa et al 2010 unesco 2004 these droughts were followed by the recovery of npp during the 2000s zhao and running 2010 when environmental rehabilitation in the 1980s began to have an effect in the region tesfaye et al 2017 hargeweyn et al 2015a nyssen et al 2010 kosmowski 2018 reported that soil and water conservation practices could improve ecosystem resistance and resilience to extreme droughts in ethiopia the correlation coefficients between the monthly anomalies of wue and monthly speis at various time scales were calculated to assess the cumulative lagged effects of drought on wue the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between monthly wue and the corresponding 1 3 6 9 and 12 month speis for 1982 2014 is shown in fig 9 the relationships of monthly wue with spei06 spei09 and spei12 were strongest in the hot semi arid and warm semi arid bioclimatic zones fig 9e indicating that estimated wue was correlated with water scarcity in dry areas the relationships of wue with spei03 spei06 spei09 and spei12 were weak in the tepid sub humid cool humid and cold humid bioclimatic zones similarly spei01 was weak and positively correlated with wue across all bioclimatic zones the spei timescale at which the correlation between wue and spei was highest also varied spatially fig 9f the patterns of response were generally associated with land cover and other environmental factors such as the climatic variables wue and spei were significantly negatively correlated in woodlands but were positively in shrubland and croplands wue and spei were both weakly positively and negatively correlated in grassland the legacy effects of drought may therefore increase or decrease the impact of hydro climatic disturbances in a month on wue yang et al 2016 the cumulative lagged effects were shorter for woodland and grassland e g 1 3 months than shrubland and cropland 6 12 months the time lag of the response of wue to drought was longest in areas in hot semi arid to cool humid zones dominated by shrubland and cropland this relatively weak positive correlation for shrubland and cropland compared to woodland suggested that these two land covers were less sensitive to drought due to human activities such as the implementation of soil and water conservation measures reservoir construction and expansion of irrigated land in adjacent sub basins ecosystem wue as an integrated measure of the coupling between the carbon and water cycles is determined by multiple and often interacting biological and physical processes the contrasting responses of wue to drought between the land covers in the semi arid and sub humid humid zones suggested different sensitivities of ecosystem processes to drought amongst the land covers ecosystem productivity of perennial vegetation and grassland responds most rapidly to precipitation variability under drought condition knapp and smith 2001 the higher sensitivity of npp to changes in hydro climatic conditions was therefore likely the primary cause of the negative correlation between wue and spei in woodland and grassland similarly ecosystems in the dry sub humid and humid zones were dominated by shrubland and cropland whose functions and activities depend greatly on water availability huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 the growth of vegetation also clearly increased in most regions compared to the trend in variation of long term npp and wue i e vegetation coverage increased throughout the highlands of the basin the accumulation of carbon npp in shrubland and cropland increased less in the semi arid zones than the sub humid and humid zones 3 8 effects of human activity on wue we analysed the relative contributions of the climatic factors and human activity in the basin to changes in wue using linear regression fig 10 the data for wue and precipitation were divided into first 1982 1999 and second 2000 2014 periods based on the results of the pettitt tests table b 6 the correlation between wue and precipitation in most sub basins was stronger in the first than the second period especially in the upper region of the basin suggesting that the variations in annual wue were influenced by both precipitation and human activity most meteorological stations in the tserare geba and worie sub basins in the upper region however did not record significant trends in precipitation tesfaye et al 2019 tesfaye et al 2017 and the significant increases in wue fig 4 and fig a 4 again suggested that anthropogenic influence was the dominant cause of the changes in wue after the 2000s the regression lines had mostly lower slopes for the first than the second period which also indicated that wue was higher in the second than the first period under similar annual precipitation human activity generally had a larger effect than the climatic factors in increasing wue for example land degradation and drought in northern ethiopia increased annually before the 1980s gebrehiwot et al 2011 edossa et al 2010 haregeweyn et al 2006 but the ethiopian government began to enforce policies of land management and environmental rehabilitation in the northern region after the 1980s these interventions increased vegetation coverage due to the widespread implementation of exclosures and the expansion of irrigated land in the region also increased due to water harvesting and the installation of irrigation infrastructure gebremicael et al 2018 fenta et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 land degradation significantly decreased in the 1990s to further improve the policy outcomes and the area of vegetation coverage gradually increased the changes in wue during the 2000s were thus mostly affected by human activities including measures of environmental rehabilitation such as ecological restoration and water harvesting wue was therefore gradually less affected by climatic factors after the 2000s and the effects of human activity on wue gradually dominated the effects of climatic factors on wue our results indicated that wue was affected by both climate change and various activities of land management changes in land use and land cover lulc indirectly indicate the level of human activity in an area the effect of lulc on wue in northern ethiopia was mainly due to ecological restoration soil and water conservation and the construction of micro dams for water harvesting and expansion of irrigation nyssen et al 2010 descheemaeker et al 2009 haregeweyn et al 2006 the main practices of these campaigns included improving land management transforming hillslopes to terraces restoring degraded cropland and rangeland to shrub and bushland using exclosures banning grazing encouraging people to plant tree saplings and seedlings building reservoirs and expanding irrigated agriculture these activities greatly affected lulc and hence wue in the basin fig 11 a and table d 1 the analysis of annual land cover derived from mcd12q1 indicated that a large area was converted to shrubland during the study period mainly in the upper region fig d 1 the changes in land cover indicated persistent changes both spatially and temporally woodland changed the most losing most of its cover decreasing 70 1 by the end of 2012 0 7 103 km2 y fig 11a shrubland was positively affected 0 3 103 km2 y increasing in area by 44 from 2001 to 2012 grassland coverage was more variable 0 03 103 km2 y increasing in area by 108 from 2001 to 2004 decreasing in area by 65 9 from 2004 to 2008 and again increasing in area by 151 from 2008 to 2012 cropland was affected more increasing in area from 58 3 in 2001 to 63 4 in 2006 0 4 103 km2 y woodland was converted mostly to cropland in the highlands where population pressure was the highest and mostly to grassland in the lowlands fig d 1 and table d 2 the increase in shrubland due to conversion from cropland and other land covers such as barren areas after ecological restoration was mostly in the upper region of the net increase in cropland area 5 1 of the basin 74 5 was due to the conversion from woodland table d 2 grassland also increased in area due to the conversion from degraded cropland and woodland areas not covered by vegetation others such as built up areas barren areas and water bodies increased significantly from 2001 to 2012 by 112 table d 1 mostly due to the conversion from cropland in the upper region fig d 1 the effects of the expansion of built up areas and water bodies on wue for the entire basin however was limited due to their relatively small proportions 1 of the basin area mean npp increased by 4 28 g c m2 y in a larger area all sub basins where vegetation coverage tended to increase over time fig 4 the drivers and associated land cover changes discussed above therefore increased ecosystem services in the basin by their impact on increased vegetation coverage and the amount and distribution of water environmental rehabilitation by ecological restoration conservation of soil and water and newly planted vegetation can increase ecosystem productivity and water availability by increasing infiltration and decreasing runoff feng et al 2013 taye et al 2013 nyssen et al 2010 the conversion of cropland and non vegetated areas to shrubland occurred mainly in the upper regions such as the gilgel tekeze and geba sub basins gebremicael et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015a this conversion not only increased vegetation coverage and the amount and distribution of water but also positively affected npp and thus wue nyssen et al 2010 and descheemaeker et al 2009 reported an increase in infiltration and improved water availability after the installation of physical measures for conserving soil and water and the implementation of exclosures in northern ethiopia a previous study also reported that environmental rehabilitation increased vegetation cover in the region tesfaye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015b nyssen et al 2015 alemayehu et al 2009 which can improve soil fertility mekuria and aynekulu 2013 descheemaeker et al 2006 decrease runoff and increase water availability guyassa et a 2017 taye et al 2018 taye et al 2015 descheemaeker et al 2009 the restoration of terrestrial vegetation in northern ethiopia since the implementation of the programme of environmental rehabilitation has generally been beneficial which in turn has increased npp and therefore wue 3 9 model evaluation and comparison with worldwide studies field data were used to validate npp estimated using the casa model the casa model has been used successfully to estimate npp in northern ethiopian highlands tesfaye et al 2017 but the model must still be validated for simulating wue due to the effect of topographic factors in tekeze river basin on the climatic inputs ultimately affecting wue we compared mean annual npp for 2001 2014 from the casa model to npp for 2016 2018 at the 202 working plots across the basin appendix g the casa model generally adequately estimated npp with an r 2 of 0 72 and a root mean square error rmse of 12 39 g c m2 y accounting for about 36 75 of the mean observed npp appendix g the mean bias defined as the modelled mean minus the observed mean of the estimated npp was 7 31 g c m2 y indicating that the casa model underestimated npp relative to observed npp these negative biases of casa in terrestrial ecosystems were mostly driven by the underestimated npp in vegetated land including cropland whereas mean biases were positive in bare land appendix g the rmses of the estimated and observed npps were 19 75 14 36 7 33 12 97 8 15 and 6 63 g c m2 y for woodland shrubland grassland homesteads cropland and bare land respectively the mismatch in scale between the plot size for the observations typically 20 20 m2 selected allometric functions and the resolution of the input data e g 250 250 m2 for modis ndvi were likely the main cause of the disagreement between the estimates and observations the generally good performance of the model indicated by the high r 2 low rmse and mean bias however suggested that the casa model could potentially be used for analysing the patterns of npp and wue under the conditions of northern ethiopia we reviewed other regional and global studies of npp eta and wue to obtain a broader context table b 15 our simulated results were comparable to previous findings based on remote sensing field observation modelling and integrated datasets from multiple sources mean annual npp eta and wue estimated for 1982 2014 were 177 96 g c m2 457 22 mm and 0 4 g c m2 mm respectively these estimates were lower than those obtained using models of mechanisms and observations at different sites worldwide but were still within reasonable range of the results reported for tropical regions khalifa et al 2018 sharma and goyal 2018 alemu et al 2014 npp in our study was consistent with previous reports belay et al 2018 sharema and goyal 2018 pan et al 2015 abdi et al 2014 but was much lower than estimates from other studies in ethiopia khalifa et al 2018 teferi et al 2015 npp in ethiopia is highest mostly in the central and western parts of the country that are covered by evergreen broadleaf forest and woody savannah khalifa et al 2018 teferi et al 2015 npp is lowest in the northeast in the semi arid region of the country which is mostly barren sparsely vegetated or covered by open shrubland and where the annual precipitation is low erratic and concentrated during two to three months of the year the tekeze river basin is in the semi arid region of northern ethiopia so a low npp was not surprising the smaller gain of carbon in this region than in other regions can be mainly attributed to the limited supply of water for vegetation growth and on going land degradation hargeweyn et al 2015a nyssen et al 2004 recent human activity in the region such as land rehabilitation however has increased vegetation productivity fenta et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 hargeweyn et al 2015b nyssen et al 2010 descheemaeker et al 2006 khalifa et al 2018 reported a distinct spatial coverage in npp for ethiopia where npp decreases towards northeast and also suggested that the high inter annual variabilities of npp in the country could be attributed to climatic variability and land cover the positive trend of npp in our study is consistent with many previous studies e g zhao et al 2019 chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 keenan et al 2013 ito and inatomi 2012 in which npp tended to continuously increase in tropical regions due to rising concentrations of atmospheric co2 the increase in npp in the tekeze river basin may have been due to the positive contributions from human activities such as ecological restoration and soil and water conservation practices guo et al 2019 tesfaye et al 2017 the overall increasing trends of annual eta throughout our investigation were comparable to previous studies kayiranga et al 2020 cheng et al 2017 and the increasing trends in wue were consistent with earlier global studies el masri et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 yang et al 2016 ito and inatomi 2012 the upwards trends of npp eta and wue were lower than the trends reported from other regions which were mostly caused by the different sensitivities of npp eta and wue to changes in climate and to human factors guo et al 2019 poulter et al 2014 tang et al 2014 traore et al 2014 feng et al 2013 knapp and smith 2001 our study demonstrated that wue in most areas of northern ethiopia was mainly controlled by precipitation and maximum air temperature consistent with previous studies zhao et al 2019 saurer et al 2014 scott et al 2014 shi et al 2014 ito and inatomi 2012 huang et al 2015 indicated that wue at the global scale was negatively correlated with increasing air temperature and solar radiation in mid and low latitudes and was positively correlated with precipitation mainly in warmer and or drier areas zhang et al 2016 and tian et al 2010 also found that wue was correlated with precipitation positively in shrubland and grassland but negatively in woodland our findings also agreed well with these reports with a comparable but more slightly negative correlation between mean wue and precipitation for shrubland and cropland in the rainy season the wue cvs for shrubland and grassland were notably significantly negatively correlated with the cvs of precipitation and maximum air temperature our findings support those of some previous reports a few studies have reported decreases in npp eta and wue tang et al 2014 jung et al 2010 zhao and running 2010 and others have found no clear trends alemu et al 2014 brÃ¼mmer et al 2012 these differences are probably due to differences in the study regions methods periods and data used eta has especially decreased in some regions perhaps due to limited water supply plant regulation of stomatal apertures and plant water content rigden and salvucci 2017 jung et al 2010 farquhar et al 1982 other studies however have reported that higher levels of atmospheric co2 may enhance vegetation growth thereby increasing eta due to the larger foliar area of the canopy cheng et al 2017 our results of small increases in eta may therefore indicate that the increase in eta caused by the increases in air temperature and vegetation coverage may be slightly larger than the reduction in eta by physiologically affecting the vegetation in northern ethiopia our analysis also found that npp increased greatly but that eta increased only slightly during the study period 1982 2014 this disproportionate change in the coupled water and carbon cycles has led to the current increase in wue we used integrated data sets including outputs from the casa model and modis products to examine the spatiotemporal variations of wue in the semi arid region of northern ethiopia which has implications for the in depth understanding of the relationship between ecosystem production and water use 3 10 uncertainties and implications the estimates of npp eta and wue inevitably contain some uncertainties due to the effects of the model parameters and algorithms input data and various interactive factors on npp eta and wue at scales of large basins and sub basins we adjusted the parameters in the casa model based on previous studies and local conditions which may not have been suitable for the study area without the adjustments and may have led to biased estimates of npp the model functions may also have contributed some uncertainties in the estimates of npp e g the casa model does not explicitly model the coefficient of water stress which is only implicitly involved by adjusting the monthly climatic data yu et al 2009 most of the input data were from sources that had been validated but the accuracy of the data may still have contributed to uncertainties in the estimates of npp and eta for example the climatic data were obtained by interpolating daily data from meteorological stations but only a few of the stations were within or close to the study area especially in the lower region where climatic information is highly variable both spatially and temporally fig 1 which may lead to some bias in the interpolated climatic data and subsequently in the estimates of npp and eta other uncertainties may have been due to data resampling and grid size all data were processed at a spatial resolution of 1 km which may be insufficiently precise to accurately identify the spatial heterogeneity of the rugged topographic conditions of the basin wue must be estimated using accurate data for evaluating the ecosystem models using more abundant and well distributed ground based measurements and satellite based observations for improving the estimation accuracy of the model we used parametric tests to analyse the relationship between the variability of wue and the climatic factors but the climatic system is quite complex so the variables may not have been normally distributed multifactorial effects and non parametric tests should thus be used to identify correlations between wue and climatic variables our findings nevertheless have important implications for understanding the effects of climate change and human activity on variations of npp eta and wue in dryland ecosystems and provide evidence for improving water resource management and ecological conservation for sustainable ecosystem services under future environmental conditions for example we expect that npp will decrease due to limited water variability and the decreased efficiency of ecosystem water use because highly variable precipitation and increased warming have been projected for the region tesfaye et al 2019 the demand for and supply of agricultural production have varied in the region due to the variability of the climate reducing agricultural production could potentially increase the shortage of food and consequently threaten food security and cause hunger in this semi arid area adopting strategies more effective than the current approaches and measures are thus urgently needed in this vulnerable region to increase the capacity of ecosystems to regulate their functioning and to adapt to changing hydro climatic conditions we recognise the importance of human activity in restoring degraded ecosystems by ecological restoration and soil and water conservation measures in the study region the effects of these interventions on total or long term ecosystem services however remain unknown but need to be verified with data from long term field measurements our spatial and temporal maps of wue variability and the contributions of climatic and human factors to the variation of wue under the water limited conditions in these dryland ecosystems will help to assess the success of practices for conserving water resources land restoration and future responses of dryland ecosystems to variable and changing hydro climatic conditions 4 conclusions identifying the patterns and factors driving of wue may improve our understanding of the trade off between water loss and carbon gain in terrestrial ecosystems we used the casa model in combination with climatic and remotely sensed datasets to examine the magnitude pattern and trend of wue and its controlling factors for five bioclimatic zones and four land covers in the dry biogeophysical environments of terrestrial ecosystems in northern ethiopia for 1982 2014 simulated mean annual npp eta and wue were 177 96 g c m2 457 22 mm and 0 4 g c mm m2 respectively and all three parameters increased both annually and seasonally wues were mostly high in woodland vegetation in the centre and south and were mostly low in the east dominated by shrubland and cropland npp eta and wue tended to significantly increase at rates of 4 28 g c m2 y 0 22 mm y and 0 01 g c mm m2 y respectively estimates of npp using models and integrated datasets from multiple sources however were slightly lower than previous estimates derived from remote sensing but estimates of eta were comparable so simulated wue was slightly underestimated an increase in npp due to an increase in vegetation coverage was the primary force driving the increase in wue because the variation of eta was stabler during the 33 year period measures of environmental rehabilitation such as ecological restoration soil and water conservation and water harvesting schemes were also effective in increasing the productivity of the terrestrial ecosystems and wue and should be given high priority in mitigating the present and future impacts of climate change annual and seasonal wue differed significantly between the semi arid and humid zones and long term wue increased significantly for each bioclimatic zone and land cover average wue was higher in semi arid than humid zones but wue increased fastest in areas with relatively low air temperatures and eta such as in the cold humid and cool humid zones and the rate of growth was lower in the semi arid zones warm and dry woodland was most resistant to drought and had the highest annual average wue 0 495 g c mm m2 these results suggest that the terrestrial ecosystems in this basin efficiently use the limited water resources for growth and have a high capacity to adapt to severe drought conditions the climatic factors that had the most distinct spatial variabilities in basin were precipitation and air temperature varying from east to west for precipitation and from hot semi arid regions to cold humid regions for air temperature wue accordingly varied spatially and temporally because it is clearly associated with precipitation and air temperature through the interacting effects with eta and npp wue varied inter annually and seasonally our results generally indicated that precipitation maximum air temperature and solar radiation were amongst the dominant factors driving wue in woodland and cropland whereas precipitation and air temperature strongly affected wue in shrubland and grassland the response of wue to drought differed between the bioclimatic zones and land covers the legacy effects of drought on monthly wue also varied with region and land cover droughts usually increased annual wue in the south and southeast but decreased wue in the northeast and west in the four driest years 1984 1991 2004 and 2009 wue had inflection points in the south for which mild 1991 and severe 1984 droughts reduced annual wue and moderate 2004 and extreme 2009 droughts slightly increased wue our results highlight the effects of environmental rehabilitation since the 1980 s in northern ethiopia in alleviating the reductions in wue induced by drought and the dry season wue in the tekeze river basin generally depended primarily on climatic factors and human intervention ecological restoration and soil and water conservation since the 2000s however have had much larger effects than climatic factors wue will thus be determined mostly by human intervention if the programme of environmental rehabilitation continues to expand in the future we also found that appropriate practices of ecological restoration and soil and water conservation could increase wue and offset the decreasing trend

4118,water use efficiency wue measures the trade off between carbon gain and water loss and is an important link between the carbon and water cycles a better understanding of spatiotemporal variation in wue and its controlling factors will help to improve ecosystem management for adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climatic change we examined the spatiotemporal variations of wue and its controlling factors for five bioclimatic zones and four land covers for 1982 2014 in the tekeze river basin in northern ethiopia we quantified mean annual and seasonal net primary productivity npp actual evapotranspiration eta and wue npp eta during this period and found that each increased significantly npp eta and therefore wue varied spatially amongst the bioclimatic zones and land covers but with different patterns wue was higher in semi arid than humid zones spatiotemporal changes in temperature and precipitation could be important controls on npp and eta variations and therefore wue mild and severe droughts in the southern regions of the basin decreased annual wue and moderate and extreme droughts slightly increased it indicating that the measure of environmental rehabilitation implemented since the 1980s have increased npp in these regions despite the water stress caused by frequent droughts the variability of wue was primarily controlled by climatic change and human activity the latter dominant since the 2000s ecological restoration and measures for conserving soil and water could substantially increase the vegetation productivity of this region and be a viable management strategy to both adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change keywords water use efficiency primary productivity ecosystem model climatic factor drought ethiopia 1 introduction climate change affects natural ecosystems in many regions of the world particularly where dryland ecosystems are sensitive to disturbances due to water shortages other processes such as land use land cover changes and atmospheric composition tropospheric ozone atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 level and nitrogen deposition interact with climate change and influence the carbon and water cycles of ecosystems niu et al 2008 yu et al 2008 ecosystem water use efficiency wue is defined as the ratio of carbon assimilation to water loss which we quantified as the ratio of net primary productivity npp to actual evapotranspiration eta keenan et al 2013 beer et al 2007 fischer and turner 1978 wue is an important physiological parameter for quantifying the trade off between carbon gain and water loss and is an essential concept for studying metabolism and energy flow in terrestrial ecosystems tang et al 2014 beer et al 2009 hu et al 2008 wue is thus an important indicator of climate change and ecosystem degradation because it helps to improve our understanding of carbon and water cycles under changing environments lu and zhuang 2010 hogg 1994 advances in observational techniques and modelling have provided a better understanding of wue and its interactions with environmental factors at different temporal e g daily monthly and annual and spatial e g local regional and global scales yang et al 2016 brÃ¼mmer et al 2012 niu et al 2011 medrano et al 2009 meeting the requirements of large scale studies of trade offs between carbon and water however remains challenging liu et al 2015 because factors such as climate landform and land cover often spatially interact which complicates generalisation from the site level to larger scales also few observation sites e g for eddy covariance have been established and are often only in specific regions and are therefore difficult to compare between biomes or for understanding local spatiotemporal patterns ecosystem models based on processes and remote sensing have recently been used to improve our understanding of the complex carbon water interactions and wue functioning under changing environments for longer periods and at regional to continental scales huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 a recent global scale analysis of wue its spatiotemporal distribution and changes by tang et al 2014 provided data from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products and measurements from 32 flux towers the analysis found that both remotely sensed and observed data provided similar wues several global and regional studies have investigated the spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem wue but few have been conducted in ethiopia guo et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 huang et al 2017 frank et al 2015 tang et al 2014 ponce campos et al 2013 tian et al 2010 the spatiotemporal variations of wue are driven by climatic and atmospheric changes and by human activities such as changes in land cover zhang et al 2016 xia et al 2015 the effect of a climatic variable on wue may vary according to the vegetation type or water condition ponce campos et al 2013 tian et al 2010 wue for wetland and cropland decreases as precipitation increases and wue for shrubland and grassland ecosystems increases with precipitation tian et al 2010 tian et al 2010 found that wue in terrestrial ecosystems in the southern usa for 1895 2007 increased much faster than npp in regions with lower than higher precipitation ponce campos et al 2013 however found that wue tended to increase from moderate to extreme droughts and decreased under wet conditions at the global scale previous studies have also found that increasing atmospheric co2 levels have significant fertilisation effects by enhancing the terrestrial uptake of co2 and by increasing wue frank et al 2015 van der sleen et al 2015 keenan et al 2013 leakey et al 2009 ainsworth and rogers 2007 adverse effects from an increase in vapor pressure deficits driven by temperature for example however could reduce productivity and increase water loss niu et al 2011 bell et al 2010 feng et al 2016 reported that human activity leading to changes in land use land cover greatly affected wue an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal variability of wue and its potential driving factors can thus help to clarify changes to carbon and water coupling cycles under future environmental conditions cheng et al 2017 niu et al 2011 northern ethiopia is particularly affected by insufficient and highly variable precipitation frequent droughts and land degradation causing large challenges for food production and threatening food security el kenawy et al 2016 gebrehiwot et al 2011 vanmaercke et al 2010 nyssen et al 2004 to address these problems various comprehensive interventions for rehabilitating degraded land have been implemented on a large scale since the 1980s gebreyohannes et al 2013 nyssen et al 2010 descheemaeker et al 2006 haregeweyn et al 2006 these measures have noticeably improved vegetation cover and hydro geomorphic processes to various degrees tesfaye et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 but the ecosystems in most areas of the region are still vulnerable due to the adverse and changing environmental conditions this vulnerability was demonstrated by the recent drought of 2015 2016 induced by el niÃ±o that affected an estimated 10 2 million people in the drought prone areas of ethiopia fews net 2016 unicef 2015 rehabilitation programmes in dryland areas create potentially conflicting demands for water between ecosystems and humans because both plants and humans depend on similar water sources in these areas feng et al 2016 the effectiveness and consequences of rehabilitation programmes on vegetation productivity can also be highly variable across bioclimatic zones for example the vegetation has improved substantially in dryland areas of northern ethiopia but the effectiveness of vegetation restoration has been limited in the humid areas gebremicael et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015a nyssen et al 2010 exploring the spatial distribution trends of variation and factors controlling wue in this ecologically vulnerable region are thus crucial for understanding the interactions between ecosystem productivity and water availability and ensuring sustainable rehabilitation programmes recent studies in northern ethiopia have focused mostly on climate change gebreselassie and moges 2015 hadgu et al 2015 tekleab et al 2013 changes in land cover birhane et al 2019 fenta et al 2016 haregeweyn et al 2015b alemayehu et al 2009 and traditional ecosystem indictors such as the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi and biomass ubuy et al 2018 alemu et al 2015 giday et al 2013 gebrehiwot et al 2011 the number of studies exploring the spatiotemporal variability of water and carbon balances and their controlling factors however have been limited until recently the influence of spatial and temporal changes in climate and human interventions on ecohydrological components is perhaps overvalued underestimated or even misunderstood in the absence of accurate assessments niu et al 2011 the characteristics of ecosystem productivity and efficiency of water use for different land covers and bioclimatic zones in northern ethiopia have also been poorly documented northern ethiopia has had clear warming trend and highly variable precipitation during the last several decades gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 nma national meteorological agency 2007 tesfaye et al 2017 seleshi and camberlin 2006 which can strongly affect carbon and water processes to our knowledge however few studies have been conducted to quantitatively evaluate the recent past changes in wue and its relationship with climatic factors for all of ethiopia e g khalifa et al 2018 and northern ethiopia e g teferi 2015 even these studies were either at national or larger basin scales which strongly limited our understanding of variability at local scale for example khalifa et al 2018 found that ecosystem wue in sudan and ethiopia for 2000 2013 responded negatively to temperature but positively to increasing precipitation but the results were not significant for most land covers and that correlations between annual wue and drought conditions were strongest for most land covers in ethiopia teferi 2015 also observed that wue in the basin of the upper blue nile abay river in ethiopia for 1982 2006 was positively and significantly correlated with maximum temperature and vapour pressure deficit in the dry sub humid and humid zones but was not correlated with these factors in semi arid zones these findings may suggest that the factors controlling wue differ amongst land covers and bioclimatic zones khalifa et al 2018 further reported that wue during 2000 2013 showed a decreasing trend for all land covers in ethiopia but teferi 2015 reported that the responses of wue varied amongst land covers a synthesis by xue et al 2015 also identified an increasing trend in wue for most land covers at the global level for 2000 2013 these discrepancies may therefore mislead or impede the responses of options to adapt to a changing climate the differences in these findings however may be partly due to the different spatiotemporal scales differences in the input data used methods and study regions these differences also indicate the need for in depth investigations of the spatiotemporal variability and driving factors of wue at different scales of space and time in the region we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of annual and seasonal wue in the dry biogeophysical environment of northern ethiopia for 1982 2014 our objectives were to 1 assess the spatiotemporal patterns of npp eta and wue in the tekeze river basin and its nine sub basins 2 determine the variability of wue over various bioclimatic zones and land covers and 3 analyse the roles of climatic factors temperature precipitation and solar radiation in controlling the variation and sensitivity of wue in response to drought as represented by the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei achieving these objectives could substantially enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal variability and driving forces of wue first this study focused on the spatiotemporal variability of wue in small basins and sub basins 3751 65541 km2 at annual and seasonal scales in the semi arid areas of northern ethiopia previous studies focused on larger basins or national levels and only annually thus providing little insight for local scales and seasons second we investigated the relationships of annual and seasonal variability in wue with means and variations of climatic factors we also identified the climatic variables that best accounted for the variations in wue across land covers and bioclimatic zones previous analyses that have examined the relationship between variation in wue and climatic indices have typically used annual means for wue and climatic factors which may provide conflicting results for inter annual deviations in wue and corresponding anomalies in mean climatic factors mohamed et al 2004 third we systematically assessed the relationship of wue variability with human activity particularly to differentiate the effects of climatic factors across periods previous studies however have not fully determined how the variations in wue depended on the drivers of changes in climate and land use 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tekeze river basin fig 1 is one of twelve major river basins in ethiopia the basin is in the drylands of northern ethiopia between latitudes 12 30 21 14 05 17 n and longitudes 37 36 42 39 42 16 e it has an approximate area of 66 541 km2 and minimum maximum and average elevations of 481 4453 and 1740 m a s l respectively the climate is highly variable due to contrasting topographical and climatic factors tesfaye et al 2019 mccartney and girma 2012 tekeze river basin has three distinct seasons with different precipitation patterns a dry winter from october to february dry season a pre monsoon hot season from march to may small rainy season and a rainy monsoon season from june to september rainy season during which approximately 80 of the field crops are grown average annual precipitation for 1961 2014 varied from 409 mm in the northeast to 1300 mm in the highlands in the southwest with a mean of 852 mm tesfaye et al 2019 annual precipitation is highly variable with a coefficient of variation cv ranging from 0 5 in the highlands to 0 1 in the lowlands average annual air temperatures range from 15 c in the southern highlands to 29 c in the northwestern lowlands with an average of 19 7 c for the basin tesfaye et al 2019 the highly variable topography and the variable air temperature and precipitation lead to different bioclimatic zones within the basin the study area comprises five zones following the ethiopian agro ecological classification proposed by hurni 1998 and moa 1998 hot semi arid lowlands beriha 1300 m a s l with mean annual temperatures 28 c warm semi arid lowlands kolla 1300 1800 m

annual temperatures of 6 16 c and cold humid highlands wurch 3200 m a s l with mean annual temperatures 6 c fig 1b and a 1 the dominant land covers are cropland 63 4 shrubland 16 grassland 13 6 and woodland 6 6 mdc12q1 product most cropland and shrubland are in the highlands fig 1c and d 1 and the lowlands are mainly covered by woodland and grassland some native forests and tree plantations are in elevated areas with the steepest slopes 35 the dominant soil types are leptosol cambisol vertisol and luvisol fao 1998 2 2 data sources and processing we estimated wue and its responses to climatic factors using climatic datasets remotely sensed data and model outputs table 1 model calculations and output mapping were conducted using arcgis 10 4 the procedure we followed to calculate wue is depicted in fig 2 all data layers were re projected to the transverse mercator projection based on the wgs 84 datum and or resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 km prior to analysis 2 2 1 ndvi and land cover data we calculated wue using spatial datasets from different sources ndvi data were obtained from the global inventory monitoring and modelling studies gimms version g data product tucker et al 2005 for 1982 2006 with an original spatial resolution of 8 km and a temporal resolution of 15 days radiation correction geometric correction and cloud filtering were applied during the preparation of this dataset to minimise various effects such as loss of calibration orbital drift and volcanic eruptions the modis mod13q1 16 day composite ndvi data at a spatial resolution of 250 m huete et al 2002 were included to extend the data to 2001 2014 these data were subjected to format conversion reprojection spatial splicing and resampling to match the spatial and temporal resolutions of the gimms ndvi land cover and climatic data the original gimms 15 day and modis 16 day ndvi composite data were aggregated to monthly data using a maximum value composite mvc approach to further reduce the influence of clouds holben 1986 both the gimms and modis ndvi data were smoothed and filtered using spector grant filtering to reduce noise in the ndvi datasets and to remove most contamination of the ndvi signals due to residual cloud cover and atmospheric haze remaining after the mvc processing the gimms and modis ndvi datasets were subsequently resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 km using a bilinear interpolation algorithm and majority rule respectively these two types of ndvi data are acquired using different sensors so comparing these data for the overlapping period 2001 2006 72 months is important correlation analyses were performed between monthly gimms and modis ndvi datasets the results indicated good agreement with a correlation coefficient of 0 86 p 0 001 so these datasets were reliable at the basin scale direct per pixel comparisons between the gimms and modis ndvi datasets were also conducted using pixel wise linear regression analysis with an average coefficient of determination r 2 for all pixels of 0 72 p 0 001 the modis ndvi data for 2001 2014 were interpolated and reconstructed for applying ndvi time series for 1982 2014 annual land cover maps spatial resolution of 500 m for 2001 2012 were acquired from the mcd12q1 modis land use product friedl et al 2010 for determining changes in land cover the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar and the maximal light use efficiency lue needed as input to the carnegie ames stanford approach casa ecosystem model the mcd12q1 data product was publicly released in 2004 and has been substantially revised to reduce classification error by introducing various approaches such as algorithm inputs including spectral and temporal information and land surface temperature lst using data for three intervening years the product however still has problems associated with classifying similar land covers friedl et al 2010 we grouped the classification results of the mcd12q1 land cover data using the classification international geosphere bio sphere programme loveland and belward 1997 based on prior knowledge of the study area previous studies tesfaye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015b and information from google earth the original eight types of land cover were combined into four woodland represent mixed forest woody savannas and savannas shrubland represent closed shrublands and open shrublands grassland represent grasslands and cropland represent croplands and cropland natural vegetation mosaic appendix d data for these land covers with spatial resolutions of 500 m were then aggregated to a resolutions of 1 km using majority aggregation channan et al 2014 2 2 2 climatic data climatic data air temperature and precipitation were obtained from 92 stations of ethiopian national meteorological agency the data from each station were generally controlled for quality to identify missing and non homogeneous data climatic data were analysed using visual inspection data consistency tests between station or regression approaches and homogenisation techniques following general wmo guidelines wmo 2011 2018 we only used data from stations with 10 missing daily data seleshi and zanke 2004 to ensure data continuity and integrity tables b 1 and c 1 finally precipitation data from 51 stations and air temperature data from 43 stations within and surrounding the basin were used see fig 1 the datasets covered daily and monthly data for 1982 2014 this study period and the 51 stations were selected to ensure the availability of data with relatively good quality and continuous records of daily and monthly climate the data gaps for the stations were filled using the weighted correlation of daily data from the nearest neighbouring stations as described in detail by woldesenbet et al 2017a and applied in the region woldesenbet et al 2017b korecha and barnston 2007 seleshi and camberlin 2006 and elsewhere beguerÃ­a et al 2019 teegavarapu et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2010 we selected the nearest neighbouring stations within a 100 km and used a threshold of kendall rank correlation tau of 0 25 tables c 2 and c 3 weighting factors were adopted after identifying good correlations p 0 0001 between neighbouring stations that both had data table c 4 daily data recorded as zero precipitation at both stations were omitted from the correlation analysis to avoid a false increase in kendall s tau due to coincident long dry periods woldesenbet et al 2017a a minimum of two and a maximum of four stations were used in the regression equation if more than four stations were within 100 km the four with the best correlations were selected after the missing data for the stations were filled data series for each stations were subjected to homogeneity tests multiple analysis of series for homogenization mash developed at the hungarian meteorological service szentimrey 2011 szentimrey 2008 szentimrey 1999 was used to homogenise daily air temperatures and precipitation for 1982 2014 detailed information for controlling the quality of the climatic data gap filling and homogenisation is provided in a supplementary document appendix c each climatic variable in and around the basin was spatially interpolated using co kriging interpolation wu and li 2013 goovaerts 1997 at a spatial resolution of 1 km to obtain values for the sub basins co kriging interpolation is considered suitable to represent areal characteristics of air temperature and precipitation in the tekeze river basin due to the limited number of stations and complex topography of northern ethiopia the interpolation of the unevenly distributed and sparse gauge stations over the complex topography of the basin however may also introduce uncertainties during modelling nyssen et al 2005 and eklundh and pilesjÃ¶ 1990 reported that elevation slope and aspect were the main topographic variables affecting the spatial distributions of climatic variables such as air temperature precipitation and total solar radiation we therefore used these topographic variables as co variates for interpolating the climatic variables and used latitude and longitude as independent variables attorre et al 2007 a digital elevation model at a resolution of 30 m was obtained from the aster gdem website table 1 two climatic datasets interpolated climate datasets with and without topographic factors were compared and validated with the observed dataset on a monthly time scale for 2010 2014 table c 5 the periods for this comparison were selected based on the quality of the data we concluded that the correlation between the estimated and observed datasets was strong so the estimated datasets were deemed reliable fig c 1 and table c 5 monthly data for total solar radiation for 1982 2014 at a grid spacing of 0 5 were obtained from the department of energy doe ii reanalysis dataset of the national centre for environmental prediction zhao and running 2010 and resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 km using bilinear interpolation appendix c 5 2 2 3 eta data and drought index the eta dataset for 1982 2014 was developed from meteorological and modis eta data fig a 2 the fao penman monteith method for limited data allen et al 1998 provided the reference et due to the lack of data for all required climatic inputs this method estimates other variables such as missing wind speed by adopting the global average wind speed or using an average wind speed at the neighbouring meteorological stations solar radiation using observed temperature and actual vapor pressure using the observed minimum air temperature when relative air humidity was not available modis eta datasets monthly mod16a2 for the nile basin with a spatial resolution of 1 km for 2001 2014 were acquired from the website of the numerical terra dynamic simulation group at the university of montana table 1 note that the period 2001 2014 was selected for eta data due to the incomplete availability of modis data for 2000 fensholt and proud 2012 ganguly et al 2010 this modis et product was developed using an improved algorithm for remote sensed et mu et al 2011 the original mod16 algorithm mu et al 2007 was developed based on the penman monteith et model monteith 1965 which uses reanalysed meteorological data and vegetation property dynamics including land cover leaf area index and albedo to estimate eta the improved mod16 algorithm uses ndvi the enhanced vegetation index and terra modis daytime lst in addition to the inputs in the previous global mod16 et algorithm for the regional and global mapping and monitoring of et mu et al 2011 mu et al 2007 the terrestrial evapotranspiration product for the nile basin was validated by mu et al 2013 using data from 46 eddy flux towers and have been used to estimate eta in the nile basin with satisfactory accuracy previous studies in northern ethiopia have used mod16 et as an estimate of eta e g alemu et al 2014 sun et al 2011 this product could not be validated with observations due to the lack of ground measurements of eta the fao penman monteith estimates of reference et were converted to eta using per pixel correlations between overlapping years of the two datasets reference et and modis eta the per pixel strength of the linear association between the two sets of data was determined by estimating the correlation coefficient for the overlapping 14 year time series of monthly observations 2001 2014 the slope and intercept of the per pixel regression were used for converting the reference et to eta for 1982 2014 the average per pixel correlation coefficient and coefficients of determination were 0 59 and 0 51 p 0 01 respectively the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index spei a widely used indictor of drought in hydrological ecological and agricultural studies vicente serrano et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2010 was adopted to assess wue response to drought appendix e estimates were obtained using the difference between monthly precipitation and potential et this difference represents a simple meteorological water balance monthly differences were aggregated for 1982 2014 and fitted to a probability distribution function for calculating spei beguerÃ­a et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2010 positive and negative speis indicate conditions above wetter and below drier normal respectively monthly spei data at a time scales of 1 3 6 9 and 12 months were used to examine the effects of drought on wue for 1982 2014 over the bioclimatic zones and land covers belayneh et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2012 spei has also been used to indicate and characterise droughts including duration start and end dates magnitude and severity see appendix e a drought begins when spei is 1 0 and ends when spei becomes positive again the duration of a drought was defined as the period when spei was 1 0 the magnitude a drought corresponded to the accumulated precipitation deficit during the drought and the quotient of this accumulated deficit volume over the drought period was the mean intensity drought severity was estimated based on the intensity and duration of the drought drought severity was classified into four categories mild moderate severe and extreme mckee et al 1993 based on the 12 month speis to the end of december see table e 1 this helped to identify longer dry periods vicente serrano 2006 when the ecohydrological processes in this semi arid region mostly respond to spei12 awange et al 2016 belayneh et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2012 2 3 data analysis wue was defined as the ratio of npp to eta ponce campos et al 2013 and was estimated for 1982 2014 for each grid cell fig 2 we then assessed the spatiotemporal patterns of wue and their responses to climatic variables using nine sub basins five bioclimatic zones and four land covers figs a 1 and d 1 monthly wue was averaged for the entire basin and for each sub basin bioclimatic zone and land cover to produce spatially averaged time series data we further illustrated the characteristics of variation in wue for relatively long time series by calculating the patterns of annual and seasonal wue for the 33 year study period in each pixel using the mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and pettitt pettitt 1979 tests which have been frequently used in similar studies the mann kendall test analyses the trend in a long term sequence appendix f 1 pettitt tests were also used to identify the changing points of the trends in the time series appendix f 2 trend free pre whitening described by yue et al 2003 was used prior to the trend analysis to avoid the effect of serial correlation on the test results a kruskal wallis non parametric method was used with the post hoc wilcoxon pairs comparison test to identify significant differences of wue npp and eta amongst the bioclimatic zones and land covers the relationships of wue with air temperature precipitation solar radiation and spei were investigated using pearson correlation we assumed that a significant correlation between the coefficients of variation cvs for wue and the climatic factors indicated that the seasonal or inter annual variability of wue could be attributed to spatial and temporal fluctuations of the climatic factors gong et al 2012 fang et al 2001 correlations were considered significant at p 0 05 the cv for a variable was defined as the ratio of its standard deviation to its mean the air temperature data in degrees celsius were first transformed to absolute temperatures because cvs are meaningful only for data measured as a ratios zar 1999 we fitted generalised linear models glms for the bioclimatic zones and land covers to determine the relative contributions of climatic variables to the variations in annual and seasonal wue tables b 2 b 5 the larger the relative contribution the more the relevant the variable all variables were normalised by the mean of the time series prior to the glm analysis we quantitatively analysed the effects of climatic variability and human activity on wue using linear regression applied to the annual wue series data during the two periods identified by the pettitt test tables b 6 and b 7 annual series of wue data for the first period i e prior to an abrupt change in wue following extensive practices of land management were used as baselines for comparison with the second period i e after an abrupt change in wue wue was therefore linearly regressed as a function of precipitation and wue in the two periods and was then analysed and compared 2 4 model parameterisation and validation the casa ecosystem model is a process based light use efficiency lue model that

harvesting and non harvesting methods were used to estimate biomass hairiah et al 2010 gibbs et al 2007 allometric regression models for mixed species in northern ethiopia proposed by mokria et al 2018 ubuy et al 2018 and gidey et al 2013 were applied to estimate aboveground biomass agb of trees and shrubs ground cover biomasses were estimated by harvesting aboveground npp was estimated using increases in agb from periodic measurements of biomass from 2016 to 2018 agb npp was estimated by multiplying agb by the default ipcc carbon fraction value of 0 47 ipcc 2006 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variability of wue the spatial variation and distribution of mean annual npp eta and wue for 1982 2014 are presented in figs 3 and 4 npp was generally high in the west and low in the east and differed significantly between the sub basins annually and seasonally tables 2 and b 8 the average annual total npp from the entire basin during the study period 1982 2014 was approximately 11 84 106 t c the mean annual npp ranged between 92 4 and 439 6 g c m2 in western regions including zarema sibta and humera where woodland cover was more abundant and high air temperatures and precipitation both contributed to high vegetation growth npp was lower in eastern regions such as worie geba and tserare where it ranged from 55 2 to 248 4 g c m2 see fig 1a for the sub basins these regions were characterised by dry climatic conditions with average annual precipitation for 1961 2014 ranging from 409 to 767 mm a short growing season 2 3 months and cropland and sparse shrub vegetation as the dominant land covers figs a 3 and d 1 npp in the remaining regions including southern tekeze basin belesa gilgel tekeze and mount ras dejen ranged between 57 6 and 280 8 g c m2 mean annual npp varied substantially regionally fig 3d particularly in the south but less in the north eta varied spatially across the basin both annually and for the rainy season table 2 and table b 8 for the small rainy season and the dry season average annual eta was approximately 457 2 mm but eta decreased as altitude increased fig 3b very consistent with the changes in both air temperature and precipitation fig a 3 eta was highest in the zarema and humera sub basins in the warm and humid lowland region of the basin and was lowest in the highlands of the upper region eta tended to increase significantly over the 33 year period during the small rainy season and the dry season in most sub basins p 0 05 fig 4b the spatial variability of wue for 1982 2014 depended on the magnitudes and patterns of npp and eta tables 2 and b 8 annual and seasonal wue differed significantly amongst most sub basins fig 3 average annual wue ranged from 0 07 to 0 91 g c mm m2 with an average of 0 4 g c mm m2 average annual wue was lower than the value of 0 74 g c mm m2 for ethiopia for 2000 2013 reported by khalifa et al 2018 most of the northern regions of the country are degraded barren or sparsely vegetated and typically have lower wues than the vegetated areas in the central and western regions wue was highest in the central and southern regions and was generally lowest in the eastern region fig 3 mean annual npp was higher in the northwest than the south and annual wue was lower in most parts of the northwest where eta was highest indicating that both vegetation type and water availability affected wue the spatial pattern of annual wue was generally positively correlated with the spatial patterns of precipitation and vegetation type figs a 3 and d 1 wue increased significantly in all seasons and sub basins over the 33 year period fig 4c wue cv was highest 0 73 mostly in the south fig 3f and lowest in areas dominated by cropland with good hydrothermal conditions vegetation coverage and the response of npp varied across the region due to spatial heterogeneity and changes in environmental factors such as land cover tesfaye et al 2019 gebremicael et al 2018 gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 interventions such as ecological restoration and measures to conserve soil and water are key factors affecting vegetation coverage and are amongst the most important factors controlling the response of npp local human activity affects vegetation coverage nyssen et al 2010 girmay et al 2009 haregeweyn et al 2006 and in our study led to coincident increases in npp and wue fig 4 with increasing interventions during the study period 3 2 temporal variability of wue mean annual npp for 1982 2014 was 178 g c m2 y ranging from 99 6 g c m2 y in 1988 to 276 g c m2 y in 2014 fig 4d annual npp thus varied substantially between years but tended to increase significantly during this period in the basin and sub basins figs 3 and 4 the temporal trends of npp shifted upwards in all sub basins and all seasons around 2000 fig 4a and tables b 6 and b 7 eta at the basin scale and in most sub basins tended to increase significantly during the small rainy season and the dry season for 1982 2014 and tended to decrease in the rainy season but not significantly fig 4 and tables 2 and b 8 annual eta for the entire basin peaked at 479 1 mm in 2009 and was lowest at 440 2 mm in 1999 wue in each sub basin tended to increase significantly by an average of 0 01 g c mm m2 y fig 4 area averaged wue temporally ranged from 0 23 g c mm m2 in 1994 to 0 62 g c mm m2 in 2014 with an average of 0 41 g c mm m2 fig 3f and 4 indicating that about 0 41 g of co2 was assimilated for vegetation growth for every millimetre of water lost by evapotranspiration wue was relatively stable before the 2000 s in most sub basins fig a 4 and then increased with substantial inter annual fluctuation tables b 6 and b 7 the corresponding tendency of npp to significantly increase and eta to be more stable may indicate that wue was influenced more by npp than eta the highest npp and wue around 2000 may be closely associated with the high precipitation during the same year tesfaye et al 2019 tesfaye et al 2017 pan et al 2015 and the intensive land management began to have an effect mostly in the upper reaches of the basin gebremicael et al 2018 fenta et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 ecosystem productivity is more sensitive to changing hydro climatic conditions in semi arid and sub humid ecosystems suggesting a high sensitivity of wue to water availability in these regions yang et al 2016 responses in these semi arid and dry sub humid ecosystems were smaller for eta than npp even though eta increased during the year concurrently with high water availability leading to a higher wue in wetter years and areas under ecological restoration figs 3 and 4 the dynamics of wue have also been dominated by the variation of npp in other countries was also observed for areas outside ethiopia zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2010 the temporal trends in npp indicated that npp was relatively low in the 1980 s and 1990 s due to significant reductions in 1983 85 1987 1988 1991 92 1993 94 1997 98 and 1999 induced by drought edossa et al 2010 unesco 2004 these periods of drought were followed by the recovery of npp during the 2000 s zhao and running 2010 when increased precipitation greatly increased npp in most parts of the basin abdi et al 2016 gebrehiwot et al 2011 numerous ecological restoration and soil and water conservation measures have been implemented in northern ethiopia since the 1980 s to increase npp using physical measures such as the construction of terraces and dams and biological measures such as exclosures closed degraded areas and protected from livestock and human intervention to enable the vegetation to recover and then planting seedlings and sowing grasses in the exclosures these measures have greatly improved vegetation coverage nyssen et al 2015 alemayehu et al 2009 favourably altered the hydrology by increasing infiltration following vegetation recovery taye et al 2013 nyssen et al 2010 haregeweyn et al 2006 and increased npp and wue 3 3 wue variability between bioclimatic zones annual and seasonal npp eta and wue were spatiotemporally variable in the bioclimatic zones for 1982 2014 fig 5 and table 2 annual and seasonal npp tended to increase significantly in each bioclimatic zone figs 5 and a 5 around 2000 tables b 6 and b 7 annual npp was significantly higher in the hot semi arid zone than the other bioclimatic zones table 2 p 0 05 npp in the hot semi arid zone 213 6 g c m2 was high mostly in the west where the climate is hot and relatively wet and most of the area received substantial precipitation fig a 3 npp however was mostly low in the tepid sub humid zone 156 24 g c m2 which is mostly in the east where the climate is mild and dry high air temperatures have a two fold effect on the vegetation carbon cycle they can increase the maximum capacity of carbon uptake and alter the phenological phases of the vegetation ito and inatomi 2012 but can also increase transpiration and evaporative loss of soil water which can in turn induce drought that limits photosynthesis and respiration liu et al 2017 this negative effect however can be offset or increased by altered precipitation and hydrological conditions these opposing effects of warming may vary amongst regions with different climatic features terrestrial ecosystems in dryland environments are usually mainly limited by the availability of water increased availability decreases water limitation increases vegetation activity and stimulates both photosynthesis and respiration tian et al 2010 knapp and smith 2001 estimates of aggregated monthly eta for 1982 2014 differed spatially between bioclimatic zones fig 5 the highest total annual eta was 530 7 mm in the hot semi arid zone and 515 9 mm in the cold humid zone which were significantly higher than in the other bioclimatic zones table 2 annual eta was similar in the warm semi arid tepid sub humid cool humid zones at 418 9 406 4 and 464 7 mm respectively table b 9 eta tended to increase significantly in all five bioclimatic zones during the small rainy season and the dry season fig a 5 in contrast eta tended to decrease during the rainy season in all bioclimatic zones but not significantly compared to other seasons annual and seasonal wue increased significantly in each of the five bioclimatic zones fig a 5 due to the increases in npp indicating substantial greening in recent decades attributed to human activity mean annual and rainy season wue differed significantly between the semi arid and humid zones but wue did not differ significantly during the small rainy season and the dry season tables 2 and b 8 the differences and seasonal variations in wue amongst bioclimatic zones may have been determined by both intrinsic biological characteristics and external environmental factors fig a 6 average annual wue in the five bioclimatic zones for 1982 2014 decreased in the order warm semi arid 0 405 g c mm m2 tepid sub humid 0 403 g c mm m2 hot semi arid 0 396 g c mm m2 cool humid 0 375 g c mm m2 cold humid 0 326 g c mm m2 zones table b 9 this order suggests that vegetation in energy limited bioclimatic zones uses water less efficiently than vegetation in water limited bioclimatic zones annual wue increased at rates 0 006 g c mm m2 y for all bioclimatic zones fig 5 wue generally tended to increase in the humid regions with smaller increases in semi arid regions comparably deficient for water resources annual and seasonal wue tended to increase significantly in all regions figs 5 and a 5 particularly during the small rainy season an increase in precipitation in the small rainy season and the dry season often induced a larger increase in npp than eta which increased annual wue precipitation in the rainy season normally corresponds to a decrease in the intensity of incoming solar radiation which is a factor controlling carbon uptake in highland areas increased precipitation can also increase evaporation from soil and the interception of rainwater by the canopy which also contribute to decreases in annual wue yang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 long and short term climatic variations such as the seasonality of precipitation and inter annual precipitation can affect ecosystem productivity and water cycling field et al 1995 water availability is the primary environmental factor in the drier region where vegetation characteristics e g lai are likely to be adapted to dry climates huxman et al 2004 in contrast air temperature is the main driver of variation in ecosystem productivity in humid regions yang et al 2016 because ecosystem functions are driven mostly by energy supply and warming increases vapor pressure deficits and potential transpiration the increase in annual and seasonal air temperatures in northern ethiopia nma 2007 tesfaye et al 2019 when increases in air temperature and water availability were combined in the humid zones reinforced transpiration leading to a positive npp response and thereby implying a higher rate of increase in wue in the humid than the semi arid zones our results consequently indicated a robust intrinsic dependence of wue on bioclimatic zone across all time scales 3 4 wue variability between land covers our results indicated that npp varied across land covers tables 2 and b 8 consistent with previous studies in ethiopia khalifa et al 2018 teferi et al 2015 npp increased for all land covers based on annual and seasonal data for 1982 2014 with the largest increases in woodland 0 82 g c m2 y and cropland 0 36 g c m2 y fig 6 annual npp also increased in grassland 0 32 g c m2 y and shrubland 0 26 g c m2 y npp increased the most in woodland and cropland in the west due to good water availability and the expansion of irrigated cropland in this region eta was spatially variable across the land covers tables 2 and b 8 and was generally highest in woodland and cropland and lowest in shrubland and grassland eta for all land covers except shrubland which is mostly in the highlands increased annually and in most seasons for 1982 2014 figs 6 and a 5 average annual precipitation at the basin scale varied little during the entire period tesfaye et al 2019 but eta tended to both increase and decrease implying that the rate of change of eta may not be consistent with that of precipitation and that other factors such as vegetation characteristics and human intervention may play a role in the hydrological balance and control the rate of eta wue differed significantly between land covers table 2 p 0 05 average wue for the four land covers generally decreased in the order woodland 0 495 g c mm m2 cropland 0 412 g c mm m2 grassland 0 393 g c mm m2 shrubland 0 383 g c mm m2 table b 10 the differences in wue between the land covers were influenced by changes in both npp and eta wue differed significantly between woodland and the other land covers because npp and eta varied significantly during 1982 2014 figs 6 and a 5 the significant decrease in eta for shrubland was compensated by the larger increase in npp fig 6d the increase in wue p 0 05 was therefore significant in shrubland fig 6f wue was generally higher in woodland than cropland and grassland suggesting that woodland ecosystems used the available water more efficiently by accessing the large area of the rooting zone these results are consistent with those reported by khalifa et al 2018 and teferi 2015 who indicated that annual wue was higher in woodland and cropland than grassland zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 and tian et al 2010 also reported that wue varied with land cover due to differences in carbon uptake and water consumption afforested and ecologically restored areas have thus become important carbon sinks due to their high capacity to sequester carbon per unit water consumed wue of the land covers increased greatly after the implementation of environmental rehabilitation and schemes for water harvesting started in the 1980s with the trend of increasing wue amongst these land covers controlled mainly by the higher npp during the 33 year period fig 6i previous studies on the effects of environmental rehabilitation in the basin tesfaye et al 2019 gebremicael et al 2018 gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 reported that ecological restoration and soil and water conservation measures were important for increasing the sustainability of land and water resources 3 5 co variation of wue and climatic variables in the bioclimatic zones the correlations between the means and cvs for wue for the five bioclimatic zones and the climatic variables are shown in fig 7 and tables b 11 and b 12 the mean annual small rainy season and dry season wues were positively correlated with precipitation air temperature and solar radiation in contrast wue was negatively correlated with maximum air temperature and solar radiation mostly in the rainy season the cvs of wue annually and during the rainy and small rainy seasons were mostly positively correlated with the cvs of precipitation air temperature and solar radiation fig 7 the cvs of annual wue however were negatively correlated with the cvs of precipitation for all bioclimatic zones most of the wue cvs in the small rainy season and the dry season were negatively correlated with the cvs of maximum and mean air temperatures the wue cvs were significantly negatively correlated with the maximum air temperature cvs mostly annually and in the small rainy season and the dry season for most bioclimatic zones highlighting the role of warming in the inter annual and seasonal variation of wue in the basin in contrast the wue cvs were generally significantly positively correlated with the maximum air temperature cvs in the rainy season for most bioclimatic zones the glm analyses further confirmed that variations in maximum air temperature alone explained approximately 1 9 of the variation in wue annually and seasonally fig 8 the variations in minimum and mean air temperatures also contributed little to the variation of wue the significant spatial and temporal differences in the correlations between wue and air temperature may mainly be attributed to the complicated mechanism of responses of wue to air temperature wue increases with air temperature when the air temperature is lower than optimal for photosynthesis and varies much more intricately when the air temperature is below a particular threshold and the actual wue is determined by the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration zhang et al 2016 keenan et al 2013 the wue cvs were significantly positively correlated with the precipitation cvs for most seasons fig 7 the cvs for annual wue and precipitation however were negatively correlated in all bioclimatic zones the correlations between the cvs of wue and precipitation were generally lower in humid regions and higher in semi arid regions precipitation and its influence on wue varied with latitude and altitude indicating that the annual and seasonal variation in wue was due to regional precipitation zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 ito and inatomi 2012 the glm analyses notably found that precipitation dominated other climatic variables and played a dominant role in regulating the variations in ecosystem wue and precipitation alone accounted for 1 17 of the variation in wue annually and seasonally fig 8 precipitation can directly affect wue and indirectly affect the characteristics of the vegetation such as composition structure and density which also affect wue feng et al 2013 engelbrecht et al 2007 ludwig et al 2005 previous studies in the blue nile river basin adjacent to the tekeze river basin found that wues were significantly and positively correlated with rainfall and air temperature in the humid zones and significantly negatively correlated with maximum air temperature and vapour pressure deficit in the semi arid zones teferi 2015 in addition to the individual effects we also examined the interactive effects of the climatic variables on wue amongst the bioclimatic zones fig 8 precipitation and maximum air temperature had a significant two way interactive effect on wue negative annually and in the dry season and precipitation and solar radiation had a significant two way interactive effect positive annually and seasonally the interactions of precipitation with minimum and mean air temperatures were also negative in the dry season but their influence was marginal for the variation of wue similarly three way interactions of precipitation maximum air temperature and solar radiation were significant and elicited responses of wue in the small rainy season positive and the dry season negative variation in wue amongst the bioclimatic zones was also positively affected by the interaction of precipitation mean air temperature and solar radiation annually and in the dry season the interaction between precipitation and air temperature was negative because the limited water availability was exacerbated by the negative effects of warming which may indicate an additional indirect effect of air temperature on wue by the water balance an increase in air temperature lead to higher evapotranspiration and lower wue the positive interactive effect between precipitation and solar radiation indicated that the positive effects of water availability and solar radiation were stronger when combined we suggest that increases in solar radiation due to declining cloud cover in areas with limited radiation such as cool and cold humid areas mostly at higher altitudes may be partly attributed to the positive interactive effect of precipitation and solar radiation nemani et al 2003 many other factors such as soil and water conservation and ecological restoration measures however may complicate the determination of the co variation between the climatic variables and wue in this water limited region for example the positive and negative interactive effects of precipitation and air temperature in different seasons were likely caused by contrasting practices of water management e g irrigation was mainly in the upper part of the basin tesfaye et al 2019 fenta et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 3 6 co variation of wue and climatic variables for the land covers wue for woodland shrubland grassland and cropland responded differently to the climatic factors fig 7 and tables b 13 and b 14 annual average wue for most land covers was correlated positively with precipitation and maximum minimum and mean air temperatures and negatively with solar radiation table b 13 mean rainy season wue for shrubland and cropland were negatively correlated with maximum minimum and mean air temperatures mean monthly wue during the small rainy season and the dry season for most of the land covers was characterised by a mixture of positive and negative correlations with air temperature and solar radiation the wue cvs for woodland were significantly negatively correlated with the cvs of precipitation maximum air temperature and solar radiation fig 7 and table b 14 the wue cvs for shrubland and grassland were significantly correlated positively with the cvs of minimum air temperature and negatively with the cvs of precipitation and maximum air temperature the wue cvs for cropland were also significantly correlated positively with the cvs of solar radiation during the rainy season but negatively with the cvs for annual precipitation and dry season maximum air temperature we quantified the relative contributions of the climatic variables and their interactive effects to further explore the variations in wue amongst the land covers fig 8 both the inter annual and seasonal variabilities of air temperature had little effect on the variations in wue amongst land covers compared with the larger contribution of precipitation annually and for most seasons the variability of solar radiation was the most important factor affecting the variation in wue the relative contributions from both the two way and three way interactive effects to the variation in wue were smaller fig 8 luo et al 2008 reported that modelled interactive effects of altered precipitation and warming had little effect on the variations in ecosystem responses in different climatic zones another meta analysis of ecosystem responses to climate change wu et al 2011 found that interactive effects were generally small precipitation air temperature and solar radiation generally modulated the annual and seasonal variation of wue consistent with recent studies khalifa et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 teferi 2015 the effects of the various climatic factors varied amongst the regions and were associated with the bioclimatic zones and land covers tang et al 2014 ito and inatomi 2012 tian et al 2010 the influences of climatic variables on the patterns of wue and the responses of wue to these variables may differ or even be opposite at different spatial local regional or global and temporal seasonal and inter annual scales liu et al 2017 keenan et al 2013 niu et al 2011 the climatic factors had different spatiotemporal patterns and the combined effect of these patterns affected the patterns of npp and eta which in turn led to the different responses of wue noted above the climatic control of npp and eta is along a continuum between either deficient water or warmer air temperature whitley et al 2011 mohamed et al 2004 variations of solar radiation air temperature or water availability that cause variability in npp will lead to changes in canopy conductance and eta beer et al 2009 3 7 effects of drought on wue 1984 85 1987 1988 1991 92 1993 94 1997 98 1999 2001 02 2002 03 and 2009 over the 33 year period were dry to drought years in ethiopia gebrehiwot et al 2011 edossa et al 2010 for example representative mild moderate severe and extreme droughts occurred in basin in 1991 2004 1984 and 2009 respectively figs e 1 and e 2 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of areas affected by droughts of different magnitudes in 1991 mild droughts occurred in most of the north western and eastern parts of the basin where annual wue decreased by up to 69 7 but annual wue increased in some parts of the central region during this period moderate droughts occurred in regions near the geba tserare and humera sub basins where annual wue decreased by up to 55 6 but annual wue increased in the central and southern regions during the same period severe and extreme droughts decreased annual wue by up to 71 4 and 64 6 respectively the responses of wue to drought varied with drought severity the timing of the droughts was partly responsible for these different responses for example mild and moderate droughts began in march and april and ended at the end of june fig e 1 which may have slightly affected ecosystem productivity because this drought only occurred early in the growing season june to september a severe drought began in january temporarily became moderate in the middle of the drought and ended at the end of october which strongly affected ecosystem productivity because this drought occurred during the growing season the 1984 severe drought continued for almost ten months and profoundly affected regional food and ecological security world bank 2006 seleshi and zanke 2004 this drought reduced both npp and eta but mostly npp thereby decreasing wue the negative anomalies in npp gradually increased with a relatively stable eta decreasing ecosystem wue during the drought below the annual mean fig e 3 the 2009 extreme drought began in january and ended at the end of november which had a larger effect on ecosystem productivity the positive anomalies of ecosystem wue during the drought in 2009 mostly occurred throughout the drought the positive anomaly in npp was larger than the positive anomaly in eta in corresponding regions thereby increasing wue during the drought these findings suggest that the overall response of wue was mainly determined by the sensitivity of npp to drought in this region the resistance of ecosystems to drought depends on various factors such as drought conditions vegetation type and human activity isbell et al 2015 ponce campos et al 2013 the diverse responses of wue to droughts in different years could thus be attributed to human activity in the region feng et al 2016 for example an extreme drought 2009 in most regions of the basin did not vary as much as a severe drought 1984 and increased annual wue mostly in the south which was attributed to interventions that increased annual npp human activities in the southern regions such as ecological restoration and extensive soil and water conservation measures were also a dominant factor controlling vegetation growth and the increase in npp in the early period may have partly offset the decrease in wue induced by the higher npp wue was relatively low in the 1980s and 1990s fig 4 due to a significant reduction in npp after a series of droughts edosa et al 2010 unesco 2004 these droughts were followed by the recovery of npp during the 2000s zhao and running 2010 when environmental rehabilitation in the 1980s began to have an effect in the region tesfaye et al 2017 hargeweyn et al 2015a nyssen et al 2010 kosmowski 2018 reported that soil and water conservation practices could improve ecosystem resistance and resilience to extreme droughts in ethiopia the correlation coefficients between the monthly anomalies of wue and monthly speis at various time scales were calculated to assess the cumulative lagged effects of drought on wue the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between monthly wue and the corresponding 1 3 6 9 and 12 month speis for 1982 2014 is shown in fig 9 the relationships of monthly wue with spei06 spei09 and spei12 were strongest in the hot semi arid and warm semi arid bioclimatic zones fig 9e indicating that estimated wue was correlated with water scarcity in dry areas the relationships of wue with spei03 spei06 spei09 and spei12 were weak in the tepid sub humid cool humid and cold humid bioclimatic zones similarly spei01 was weak and positively correlated with wue across all bioclimatic zones the spei timescale at which the correlation between wue and spei was highest also varied spatially fig 9f the patterns of response were generally associated with land cover and other environmental factors such as the climatic variables wue and spei were significantly negatively correlated in woodlands but were positively in shrubland and croplands wue and spei were both weakly positively and negatively correlated in grassland the legacy effects of drought may therefore increase or decrease the impact of hydro climatic disturbances in a month on wue yang et al 2016 the cumulative lagged effects were shorter for woodland and grassland e g 1 3 months than shrubland and cropland 6 12 months the time lag of the response of wue to drought was longest in areas in hot semi arid to cool humid zones dominated by shrubland and cropland this relatively weak positive correlation for shrubland and cropland compared to woodland suggested that these two land covers were less sensitive to drought due to human activities such as the implementation of soil and water conservation measures reservoir construction and expansion of irrigated land in adjacent sub basins ecosystem wue as an integrated measure of the coupling between the carbon and water cycles is determined by multiple and often interacting biological and physical processes the contrasting responses of wue to drought between the land covers in the semi arid and sub humid humid zones suggested different sensitivities of ecosystem processes to drought amongst the land covers ecosystem productivity of perennial vegetation and grassland responds most rapidly to precipitation variability under drought condition knapp and smith 2001 the higher sensitivity of npp to changes in hydro climatic conditions was therefore likely the primary cause of the negative correlation between wue and spei in woodland and grassland similarly ecosystems in the dry sub humid and humid zones were dominated by shrubland and cropland whose functions and activities depend greatly on water availability huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 the growth of vegetation also clearly increased in most regions compared to the trend in variation of long term npp and wue i e vegetation coverage increased throughout the highlands of the basin the accumulation of carbon npp in shrubland and cropland increased less in the semi arid zones than the sub humid and humid zones 3 8 effects of human activity on wue we analysed the relative contributions of the climatic factors and human activity in the basin to changes in wue using linear regression fig 10 the data for wue and precipitation were divided into first 1982 1999 and second 2000 2014 periods based on the results of the pettitt tests table b 6 the correlation between wue and precipitation in most sub basins was stronger in the first than the second period especially in the upper region of the basin suggesting that the variations in annual wue were influenced by both precipitation and human activity most meteorological stations in the tserare geba and worie sub basins in the upper region however did not record significant trends in precipitation tesfaye et al 2019 tesfaye et al 2017 and the significant increases in wue fig 4 and fig a 4 again suggested that anthropogenic influence was the dominant cause of the changes in wue after the 2000s the regression lines had mostly lower slopes for the first than the second period which also indicated that wue was higher in the second than the first period under similar annual precipitation human activity generally had a larger effect than the climatic factors in increasing wue for example land degradation and drought in northern ethiopia increased annually before the 1980s gebrehiwot et al 2011 edossa et al 2010 haregeweyn et al 2006 but the ethiopian government began to enforce policies of land management and environmental rehabilitation in the northern region after the 1980s these interventions increased vegetation coverage due to the widespread implementation of exclosures and the expansion of irrigated land in the region also increased due to water harvesting and the installation of irrigation infrastructure gebremicael et al 2018 fenta et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 land degradation significantly decreased in the 1990s to further improve the policy outcomes and the area of vegetation coverage gradually increased the changes in wue during the 2000s were thus mostly affected by human activities including measures of environmental rehabilitation such as ecological restoration and water harvesting wue was therefore gradually less affected by climatic factors after the 2000s and the effects of human activity on wue gradually dominated the effects of climatic factors on wue our results indicated that wue was affected by both climate change and various activities of land management changes in land use and land cover lulc indirectly indicate the level of human activity in an area the effect of lulc on wue in northern ethiopia was mainly due to ecological restoration soil and water conservation and the construction of micro dams for water harvesting and expansion of irrigation nyssen et al 2010 descheemaeker et al 2009 haregeweyn et al 2006 the main practices of these campaigns included improving land management transforming hillslopes to terraces restoring degraded cropland and rangeland to shrub and bushland using exclosures banning grazing encouraging people to plant tree saplings and seedlings building reservoirs and expanding irrigated agriculture these activities greatly affected lulc and hence wue in the basin fig 11 a and table d 1 the analysis of annual land cover derived from mcd12q1 indicated that a large area was converted to shrubland during the study period mainly in the upper region fig d 1 the changes in land cover indicated persistent changes both spatially and temporally woodland changed the most losing most of its cover decreasing 70 1 by the end of 2012 0 7 103 km2 y fig 11a shrubland was positively affected 0 3 103 km2 y increasing in area by 44 from 2001 to 2012 grassland coverage was more variable 0 03 103 km2 y increasing in area by 108 from 2001 to 2004 decreasing in area by 65 9 from 2004 to 2008 and again increasing in area by 151 from 2008 to 2012 cropland was affected more increasing in area from 58 3 in 2001 to 63 4 in 2006 0 4 103 km2 y woodland was converted mostly to cropland in the highlands where population pressure was the highest and mostly to grassland in the lowlands fig d 1 and table d 2 the increase in shrubland due to conversion from cropland and other land covers such as barren areas after ecological restoration was mostly in the upper region of the net increase in cropland area 5 1 of the basin 74 5 was due to the conversion from woodland table d 2 grassland also increased in area due to the conversion from degraded cropland and woodland areas not covered by vegetation others such as built up areas barren areas and water bodies increased significantly from 2001 to 2012 by 112 table d 1 mostly due to the conversion from cropland in the upper region fig d 1 the effects of the expansion of built up areas and water bodies on wue for the entire basin however was limited due to their relatively small proportions 1 of the basin area mean npp increased by 4 28 g c m2 y in a larger area all sub basins where vegetation coverage tended to increase over time fig 4 the drivers and associated land cover changes discussed above therefore increased ecosystem services in the basin by their impact on increased vegetation coverage and the amount and distribution of water environmental rehabilitation by ecological restoration conservation of soil and water and newly planted vegetation can increase ecosystem productivity and water availability by increasing infiltration and decreasing runoff feng et al 2013 taye et al 2013 nyssen et al 2010 the conversion of cropland and non vegetated areas to shrubland occurred mainly in the upper regions such as the gilgel tekeze and geba sub basins gebremicael et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015a this conversion not only increased vegetation coverage and the amount and distribution of water but also positively affected npp and thus wue nyssen et al 2010 and descheemaeker et al 2009 reported an increase in infiltration and improved water availability after the installation of physical measures for conserving soil and water and the implementation of exclosures in northern ethiopia a previous study also reported that environmental rehabilitation increased vegetation cover in the region tesfaye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015b nyssen et al 2015 alemayehu et al 2009 which can improve soil fertility mekuria and aynekulu 2013 descheemaeker et al 2006 decrease runoff and increase water availability guyassa et a 2017 taye et al 2018 taye et al 2015 descheemaeker et al 2009 the restoration of terrestrial vegetation in northern ethiopia since the implementation of the programme of environmental rehabilitation has generally been beneficial which in turn has increased npp and therefore wue 3 9 model evaluation and comparison with worldwide studies field data were used to validate npp estimated using the casa model the casa model has been used successfully to estimate npp in northern ethiopian highlands tesfaye et al 2017 but the model must still be validated for simulating wue due to the effect of topographic factors in tekeze river basin on the climatic inputs ultimately affecting wue we compared mean annual npp for 2001 2014 from the casa model to npp for 2016 2018 at the 202 working plots across the basin appendix g the casa model generally adequately estimated npp with an r 2 of 0 72 and a root mean square error rmse of 12 39 g c m2 y accounting for about 36 75 of the mean observed npp appendix g the mean bias defined as the modelled mean minus the observed mean of the estimated npp was 7 31 g c m2 y indicating that the casa model underestimated npp relative to observed npp these negative biases of casa in terrestrial ecosystems were mostly driven by the underestimated npp in vegetated land including cropland whereas mean biases were positive in bare land appendix g the rmses of the estimated and observed npps were 19 75 14 36 7 33 12 97 8 15 and 6 63 g c m2 y for woodland shrubland grassland homesteads cropland and bare land respectively the mismatch in scale between the plot size for the observations typically 20 20 m2 selected allometric functions and the resolution of the input data e g 250 250 m2 for modis ndvi were likely the main cause of the disagreement between the estimates and observations the generally good performance of the model indicated by the high r 2 low rmse and mean bias however suggested that the casa model could potentially be used for analysing the patterns of npp and wue under the conditions of northern ethiopia we reviewed other regional and global studies of npp eta and wue to obtain a broader context table b 15 our simulated results were comparable to previous findings based on remote sensing field observation modelling and integrated datasets from multiple sources mean annual npp eta and wue estimated for 1982 2014 were 177 96 g c m2 457 22 mm and 0 4 g c m2 mm respectively these estimates were lower than those obtained using models of mechanisms and observations at different sites worldwide but were still within reasonable range of the results reported for tropical regions khalifa et al 2018 sharma and goyal 2018 alemu et al 2014 npp in our study was consistent with previous reports belay et al 2018 sharema and goyal 2018 pan et al 2015 abdi et al 2014 but was much lower than estimates from other studies in ethiopia khalifa et al 2018 teferi et al 2015 npp in ethiopia is highest mostly in the central and western parts of the country that are covered by evergreen broadleaf forest and woody savannah khalifa et al 2018 teferi et al 2015 npp is lowest in the northeast in the semi arid region of the country which is mostly barren sparsely vegetated or covered by open shrubland and where the annual precipitation is low erratic and concentrated during two to three months of the year the tekeze river basin is in the semi arid region of northern ethiopia so a low npp was not surprising the smaller gain of carbon in this region than in other regions can be mainly attributed to the limited supply of water for vegetation growth and on going land degradation hargeweyn et al 2015a nyssen et al 2004 recent human activity in the region such as land rehabilitation however has increased vegetation productivity fenta et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 hargeweyn et al 2015b nyssen et al 2010 descheemaeker et al 2006 khalifa et al 2018 reported a distinct spatial coverage in npp for ethiopia where npp decreases towards northeast and also suggested that the high inter annual variabilities of npp in the country could be attributed to climatic variability and land cover the positive trend of npp in our study is consistent with many previous studies e g zhao et al 2019 chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 keenan et al 2013 ito and inatomi 2012 in which npp tended to continuously increase in tropical regions due to rising concentrations of atmospheric co2 the increase in npp in the tekeze river basin may have been due to the positive contributions from human activities such as ecological restoration and soil and water conservation practices guo et al 2019 tesfaye et al 2017 the overall increasing trends of annual eta throughout our investigation were comparable to previous studies kayiranga et al 2020 cheng et al 2017 and the increasing trends in wue were consistent with earlier global studies el masri et al 2019 cheng et al 2017 yang et al 2016 ito and inatomi 2012 the upwards trends of npp eta and wue were lower than the trends reported from other regions which were mostly caused by the different sensitivities of npp eta and wue to changes in climate and to human factors guo et al 2019 poulter et al 2014 tang et al 2014 traore et al 2014 feng et al 2013 knapp and smith 2001 our study demonstrated that wue in most areas of northern ethiopia was mainly controlled by precipitation and maximum air temperature consistent with previous studies zhao et al 2019 saurer et al 2014 scott et al 2014 shi et al 2014 ito and inatomi 2012 huang et al 2015 indicated that wue at the global scale was negatively correlated with increasing air temperature and solar radiation in mid and low latitudes and was positively correlated with precipitation mainly in warmer and or drier areas zhang et al 2016 and tian et al 2010 also found that wue was correlated with precipitation positively in shrubland and grassland but negatively in woodland our findings also agreed well with these reports with a comparable but more slightly negative correlation between mean wue and precipitation for shrubland and cropland in the rainy season the wue cvs for shrubland and grassland were notably significantly negatively correlated with the cvs of precipitation and maximum air temperature our findings support those of some previous reports a few studies have reported decreases in npp eta and wue tang et al 2014 jung et al 2010 zhao and running 2010 and others have found no clear trends alemu et al 2014 brÃ¼mmer et al 2012 these differences are probably due to differences in the study regions methods periods and data used eta has especially decreased in some regions perhaps due to limited water supply plant regulation of stomatal apertures and plant water content rigden and salvucci 2017 jung et al 2010 farquhar et al 1982 other studies however have reported that higher levels of atmospheric co2 may enhance vegetation growth thereby increasing eta due to the larger foliar area of the canopy cheng et al 2017 our results of small increases in eta may therefore indicate that the increase in eta caused by the increases in air temperature and vegetation coverage may be slightly larger than the reduction in eta by physiologically affecting the vegetation in northern ethiopia our analysis also found that npp increased greatly but that eta increased only slightly during the study period 1982 2014 this disproportionate change in the coupled water and carbon cycles has led to the current increase in wue we used integrated data sets including outputs from the casa model and modis products to examine the spatiotemporal variations of wue in the semi arid region of northern ethiopia which has implications for the in depth understanding of the relationship between ecosystem production and water use 3 10 uncertainties and implications the estimates of npp eta and wue inevitably contain some uncertainties due to the effects of the model parameters and algorithms input data and various interactive factors on npp eta and wue at scales of large basins and sub basins we adjusted the parameters in the casa model based on previous studies and local conditions which may not have been suitable for the study area without the adjustments and may have led to biased estimates of npp the model functions may also have contributed some uncertainties in the estimates of npp e g the casa model does not explicitly model the coefficient of water stress which is only implicitly involved by adjusting the monthly climatic data yu et al 2009 most of the input data were from sources that had been validated but the accuracy of the data may still have contributed to uncertainties in the estimates of npp and eta for example the climatic data were obtained by interpolating daily data from meteorological stations but only a few of the stations were within or close to the study area especially in the lower region where climatic information is highly variable both spatially and temporally fig 1 which may lead to some bias in the interpolated climatic data and subsequently in the estimates of npp and eta other uncertainties may have been due to data resampling and grid size all data were processed at a spatial resolution of 1 km which may be insufficiently precise to accurately identify the spatial heterogeneity of the rugged topographic conditions of the basin wue must be estimated using accurate data for evaluating the ecosystem models using more abundant and well distributed ground based measurements and satellite based observations for improving the estimation accuracy of the model we used parametric tests to analyse the relationship between the variability of wue and the climatic factors but the climatic system is quite complex so the variables may not have been normally distributed multifactorial effects and non parametric tests should thus be used to identify correlations between wue and climatic variables our findings nevertheless have important implications for understanding the effects of climate change and human activity on variations of npp eta and wue in dryland ecosystems and provide evidence for improving water resource management and ecological conservation for sustainable ecosystem services under future environmental conditions for example we expect that npp will decrease due to limited water variability and the decreased efficiency of ecosystem water use because highly variable precipitation and increased warming have been projected for the region tesfaye et al 2019 the demand for and supply of agricultural production have varied in the region due to the variability of the climate reducing agricultural production could potentially increase the shortage of food and consequently threaten food security and cause hunger in this semi arid area adopting strategies more effective than the current approaches and measures are thus urgently needed in this vulnerable region to increase the capacity of ecosystems to regulate their functioning and to adapt to changing hydro climatic conditions we recognise the importance of human activity in restoring degraded ecosystems by ecological restoration and soil and water conservation measures in the study region the effects of these interventions on total or long term ecosystem services however remain unknown but need to be verified with data from long term field measurements our spatial and temporal maps of wue variability and the contributions of climatic and human factors to the variation of wue under the water limited conditions in these dryland ecosystems will help to assess the success of practices for conserving water resources land restoration and future responses of dryland ecosystems to variable and changing hydro climatic conditions 4 conclusions identifying the patterns and factors driving of wue may improve our understanding of the trade off between water loss and carbon gain in terrestrial ecosystems we used the casa model in combination with climatic and remotely sensed datasets to examine the magnitude pattern and trend of wue and its controlling factors for five bioclimatic zones and four land covers in the dry biogeophysical environments of terrestrial ecosystems in northern ethiopia for 1982 2014 simulated mean annual npp eta and wue were 177 96 g c m2 457 22 mm and 0 4 g c mm m2 respectively and all three parameters increased both annually and seasonally wues were mostly high in woodland vegetation in the centre and south and were mostly low in the east dominated by shrubland and cropland npp eta and wue tended to significantly increase at rates of 4 28 g c m2 y 0 22 mm y and 0 01 g c mm m2 y respectively estimates of npp using models and integrated datasets from multiple sources however were slightly lower than previous estimates derived from remote sensing but estimates of eta were comparable so simulated wue was slightly underestimated an increase in npp due to an increase in vegetation coverage was the primary force driving the increase in wue because the variation of eta was stabler during the 33 year period measures of environmental rehabilitation such as ecological restoration soil and water conservation and water harvesting schemes were also effective in increasing the productivity of the terrestrial ecosystems and wue and should be given high priority in mitigating the present and future impacts of climate change annual and seasonal wue differed significantly between the semi arid and humid zones and long term wue increased significantly for each bioclimatic zone and land cover average wue was higher in semi arid than humid zones but wue increased fastest in areas with relatively low air temperatures and eta such as in the cold humid and cool humid zones and the rate of growth was lower in the semi arid zones warm and dry woodland was most resistant to drought and had the highest annual average wue 0 495 g c mm m2 these results suggest that the terrestrial ecosystems in this basin efficiently use the limited water resources for growth and have a high capacity to adapt to severe drought conditions the climatic factors that had the most distinct spatial variabilities in basin were precipitation and air temperature varying from east to west for precipitation and from hot semi arid regions to cold humid regions for air temperature wue accordingly varied spatially and temporally because it is clearly associated with precipitation and air temperature through the interacting effects with eta and npp wue varied inter annually and seasonally our results generally indicated that precipitation maximum air temperature and solar radiation were amongst the dominant factors driving wue in woodland and cropland whereas precipitation and air temperature strongly affected wue in shrubland and grassland the response of wue to drought differed between the bioclimatic zones and land covers the legacy effects of drought on monthly wue also varied with region and land cover droughts usually increased annual wue in the south and southeast but decreased wue in the northeast and west in the four driest years 1984 1991 2004 and 2009 wue had inflection points in the south for which mild 1991 and severe 1984 droughts reduced annual wue and moderate 2004 and extreme 2009 droughts slightly increased wue our results highlight the effects of environmental rehabilitation since the 1980 s in northern ethiopia in alleviating the reductions in wue induced by drought and the dry season wue in the tekeze river basin generally depended primarily on climatic factors and human intervention ecological restoration and soil and water conservation since the 2000s however have had much larger effects than climatic factors wue will thus be determined mostly by human intervention if the programme of environmental rehabilitation continues to expand in the future we also found that appropriate practices of ecological restoration and soil and water conservation could increase wue and offset the decreasing trend

understanding the regional water cycle which ultimately helps to allocate govern and manage the basin scale water resources efficiently and effectively ndehedehe et al 2016 although the conventional way of quantifying the various hydrological as well as water storage components includes ground based data the inherent limitations leading to the infrequent data lengths on the fine spatial scales usually impede an accurate continuous and integrative assessment for the river basins globally abhishek and kinouchi 2021b nevertheless the past gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and the ongoing grace follow on both jointly referred to as grace fo hereafter a tandem satellite mission initially launched in march 2002 enable us to measure the earth s mass distribution and subsequently quantify the changes in tws with unprecedented accuracy chen et al 2020 tapley et al 2019 outperforming a variety of remotely sensed data that primarily focus on few components of water storage grace fo derived tws has the least uncertainties on a basin size of 100 000 km2 at the current processing level and thus provides a big picture of the water storage famiglietti et al 2015 some studies have used grace based tws for assessing the impact of anthropogenic disturbances e g scanlon et al 2012 climate change e g rodell et al 2018 and events of droughts e g liu et al 2020 and floods e g chen et al 2010 in various regions globally to the best of our knowledge however no work has been done utilizing the grace fo to analyze the dynamics of the terrestrial water storage tws and segregated constituent components in the chao phraya river basin where frequent floods and droughts have been affecting various human activities moreover the sparse and infrequent measurement of groundwater gw in addition to overreliance on gw by registered and unregistered wells especially during dry periods potentially limit appropriate monitoring and assessment of gw resources leading to the continuous unsustainable abstraction which eventually may lead to significant depletion of the commonly invisible gw in this study therefore we jointly used grace satellite data with the land surface models output to disaggregate the constituent components of tws quantify the linkage and interaction among water fluxes e g runoff evapotranspiration assess the hydroclimatic extremes that occurred in the basin and analyze the effect of the policy change for water management essentially among groundwater and surface water due to the climatic shift to a warmer temperature rapid industrialization and urbanization and intense agricultural practices the intensity frequency and extent of the hydroclimatic extremes i e droughts and floods are expected to increase in the near future with relatively severe consequences attributed to the region s high dependency on water resources amnuaylojaroen and chanvichit 2019 ipcc 2007 supharatid 2015 tangang et al 2020 cprb has likely been shifting from a state of water richness towards water scarcity conditions making the basin more vulnerable to minor variations in the hydrological cycle kiguchi et al 2021 supharatid 2015 given the highly variable climate conditions and continually increasing urbanization and the subsequent extreme hydrological conditions costing billions of dollars to the economy and a key economic and policymaking role in southeast asia kiguchi et al 2021 sound knowledge of the basin scale hydrologic cycle is crucial in this paper therefore we quantify the terrestrial water storage dynamics in the basin and attempt to get insights into the ability of the satellite data jointly used with land surface models and artificial neural networks to capture the flood and drought events the variability of tws and its constituent components and their propagation behavior through the system will enable us to understand the hydrological footprints for supporting sustainable decisions on a necessary adaptation of the human activities e g updating the reservoir rule curves revising the groundwater pumping regulations in the basin the remaining of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 salient features of the study area data types and their sources and various methods used and proposed in the study are presented section 3 includes the results and discussion of different analyses of the study along with the discussion of institutional interventions for ensuring a sound hydrological cycle in the basin finally the concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the chao phraya river basin fig 1 is primarily an agrarian basin agricultural lands covering over 90 of the basin with a geographical area of 160 000 km2 and a population of 30 million onwrc 2006 https fdmt iwlearn org the southern part of cprb is a low lying area with an elevation of as low as 2 5 m above mean sea level msl fig 1 making it susceptible to large flooding events the basin s climate is dominated by tropical monsoons with a mean and maximum daily temperature of 27 c and 40 c respectively the basin receives an average annual rainfall of 150 cm varying between 100 and 200 cm from the western to eastern parts about 90 of the rainfall is received in the monsoon season from may to october which generates an average runoff of 25 45 cm in the basin 85 of which occurs in july to december komolafe et al 2019 tau chia et al 2015 due to the absence of ample rainfall after the onset of the dry season during the first half of the year i e from january to june natural flows generally remain small which leads to an intermittent shift of dependence from surface water to groundwater for meeting various water demands in the basin subject to the prevailing water availability and the related policies 2 2 data used due to the lack of a sufficiently dense and uniform observation network of in situ data in the basin and the insufficient record length and intermittent and frequent gaps in the limited ground data we accessed the auxiliary datasets of weather and water storage ws components from various remote sensing products and land surface models although the output fields from nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas agree favorably well with the other model products and observed data rodell et al 2015 the ensemble mean of the multisource data products for the weather data depending on the time range of available data was used to characterize the uncertainty and to avoid implicit biases in a single dataset li et al 2019a long et al 2014b as described below 2 2 1 weather data precipitation the main water influx to any region plays a vital role in regional water balance and hydrological modeling chen et al 2017 xie et al 2019 we used an average of the precipitation data from trmm 3b43 version7 i e tropical rainfall measuring mission that is a joint mission by nasa and jaxa gpcp era5 merra 2 and chirps chen et al 2020 gelaro et al 2017 funk et al 2015 hersbach et al 2020 huffman et al 2009 trmm 2011 the study area does not receive any snowfall hence this component was excluded from the analysis evapotranspiration the major outflux in a region is an indispensable component and also one of the most scarcely measured variables which is difficult to ground reference primarily due to the high non closure of energy budget and micrometeorological flux measurements footprints xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 therefore the average of evapotranspiration products from three different categories land surface model lsm gldas noah v2 1 beaudoing and rodell 2020 satellite gleam v3 5a martens et al 2017 reanalysis merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 was used to get reliable and unbiased estimates of evapotranspiration over the study region ensemble mean of the monthly values of basin wide near surface air temperature were obtained from the gldas noah archive and merra 2 reanalysis dataset gelaro et al 2017 2 2 2 water storage components data we used the past grace data availability april 2002 to june 2017 and current grace fo data availability june 2018 to present satellite data from the three processing centers namely center for space research csr geoforschungszentrum gfz and jet propulsion laboratory jpl from sept 2002 to aug 2020 a combination of the spherical harmonics sh from gfz and mascons from jpl and csr was used to derive the combined time series of the basin averaged terrestrial water storage tws time series ferreira et al 2016 long et al 2014b uncertainties associated with the post processing of the grace gravity data has been reduced continuously and are at a minimum for the latest grace fo data which has resulted in reasonably good agreement between the various grace derived variables and those estimated from other hydrologic models chen et al 2020 owing to the improved accuracy over the model dependent methods multiplicative additive and scaling the data driven model independent approach proposed by vishwakarma et al 2017 was used for the bias leakage correction in grace products all the processing steps for converting the grace fo satellite data to basin averaged monthly tws and for the subsequent corrections are described in several studies e g rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 2015 vishwakarma et al 2017 among others and are not repeated here for the soil moisture storage sms we used the average of the simulation outputs from the three lsms from nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas model namely noah v3 3 gldas v2 1 variable infiltration capacity vic and clm v2 0 gldas v1 li et al 2019b and one global hydrological water resource model watergap v2 2d mÃ¼ller schmied et al 2021 yin et al 2021 observed data of the dam water storage and stream gauge data were obtained from the royal irrigation department rid thailand http app rid go th 88 reservoir rsvmiddle and national hydroinformatics data center http www thaiwater net respectively the basin wide river water storage and flood inundation depth data was obtained from sayama et al 2015 groundwater well data in terms of groundwater table data used for the qualitative comparison of the remotely sensed groundwater storage derived in this study was obtained from the department of groundwater resources http www dgr go th 2 3 methods to fulfill our objectives we first generated a continuous monthly time series of basin wide twsa using an ann model coupled with the genetic algorithm and quantified the linear and non linear decadal trends in various segregated and integrated components of the hydrological cycle and water storage then we evaluated various hydroclimatic extremes droughts and floods in the basin and conducted an empirical analysis of different drought indices to understand the drought propagation between various water storage components in the basin finally we proposed a novel drought potential index dpi to not only explore the long term trend in the basin s drought potential but also to examine the drought in the wet season considering both the natural variability in precipitation and human influences embedded in the water storage all the data sources and types along with the methodology and the various research components considered in this study are represented in fig 2 2 3 1 artificial neural network for overcoming the data gap of the grace fo records we hereby propose artificial neural network based models employing the multilayer perceptron mlp neural network with backpropagation bp and coupled with genetic algorithms ga mlp bp ga hereafter by taking advantage of the availability of the multisource ancillary data products and less complex configuration of ann compared to the recent complex deep learning models ann models have been utilized for a multitude of applications in water resources such as forecasting streamflow tongal and booij 2018 flood frequency analysis shu and ouarda 2007 rainfall runoff modeling nourani 2017 among others owing to their non parametric nature ann methods outperform the forecasting using the conventional hydro meteorological models particularly in the complex underlying processes shu and ouarda 2007 xie et al 2019 mlp neural network is one of the most widely used ann methods for predicting various hydro meteorological variables and subsequent water resources management chitsazan et al 2015 long et al 2014a long et al 2014b seyoum and milewski 2017 xie et al 2019 the feed forward network using the hyperbolic tangent activation function a sigmoidal function with a range of 1 1 was used the tested predictors include the combinations of soil moisture air temperature evapotranspiration and the output is terrestrial water storage the network has three layer types i e the input layer the hidden layer consisting of many neurons defining the weighted sum of the various predictors and the output layer fig 2 due to the less elapsed time in the convergence a levenberg marquardt backpropagation algorithm was used in this study further we employed a genetic algorithm with an optimization function to minimize the root mean square error and maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient to decide the optimum number of hidden neurons maier et al 2014 which turned out to be five in the current study the ga thus prevents the mlp bp ga model from either over fitting or under fitting the functional relationship between the predictors and the output we used initial 178 values of twsa i e 87 of the total 205 available monthly values from sept 2002 to jun 2017 for training the model and the remaining 27 values i e 13 from jun 2018 to aug 2020 for validation purpose furthermore the model performance was evaluated during the training and validation using a number of statistical parameters including pearson correlation coefficient r normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient mathematically these parameters are defined as below 1 r i 1 n x m i x m i x o i x o i i 1 n x m i x m i 2 i 1 n x o i x o i 2 2 n r m s e i 1 n x m i x o i 2 i 1 n x o i 2 3 n s e 1 i 1 n x m i x o i 2 i 1 n x o i x o i 2 where n is the number of months which are different for different runs of training and testing x m i and x o i are the modeled and observed twsa respectively for the ith month x mi and x oi are the average of the modeled and observed twsa time series lastly the twsa for the eleven missing months july 2017 to may 2018 was estimated using the trained and validated model recurring gaps of 1 2 months at every 5 6 months due to the active battery management after 2011 were filled by linear interpolation of the two bounding values abhishek and kinouchi 2021b xie et al 2018 2 3 2 combined twsa time series and regional water balance we derived the combined terrestrial water storage time series using the three grace fo products namely csr m gfz sh and jpl m using the three cornered hat tch method which has recently been utilized in hydrology long et al 2014a although the ensemble mean of multiple time series is also used abhishek and kinouchi 2021a we adhere to the tch method which considers the uncertainties associated with the individual data series ferreira et al 2016 the combined tws series corresponding to the minimal noise variance is generated based on the common signals removal from the multiple data series abhishek and kinouchi 2021b chen et al 2019 koot et al 2006 since all of the water storage components are influenced by either climatic impacts or anthropogenic impacts or a combination of both the dynamics of each component need to be understood to assess how the water moves through the system aghakouchak et al 2021 scanlon et al 2015 therefore we segregated the individual water storage components of tws to better understand the imbalance between water inputs and outputs monthly tws can be written as the sum of all constituent components by 4 t w s s w s s m s g w s where s w s s m s and g w s are storage components corresponding to the surface water i e the water storage in the dam reservoirs flood inundation and rivers soil moisture and groundwater please note that all of the above water storage components and the climatic variables are basin averaged monthly time series anomalies relative to the long term mean of the individual time series and are represented as the equivalent water depth cm or as equivalent water volume km3 the basin wide river water storage data was obtained as the difference between catchment water storage and soil moisture following the green ampt g a model for 2002 2011 sayama et al 2015 and was estimated for 2012 2020 using the current mlp bp ga model with dam water storage water release from dams stream gauge data collected at nakhon sawan fig 1 tws and precipitation as predictors additionally the flood inundation depths simulated for 2002 2011 by the rainfall runoff inundation rri model sayama et al 2015 and estimated for 2012 2020 using the ann model were used lastly linear and non linear trends extreme point symmetric mode decomposition method supplementary text s1 were quantified 2 3 3 water storage deficits further we removed the monthly climatology from all the water storage components to get insights into the dynamics of each component and their contribution to flood and drought events for example the deficits and surplus in the terrestrial water storage were calculated as below 5 t w s d j k t w s a j k t w s a k where twsd is the terrestrial water storage deficit or surplus subscripts j and k represent the year and month respectively t w s a j k is the terrestrial water storage anomaly for the jth year and kth month and t w s a k is the average of monthly twsa over the period between september 2002 and august 2020 similarly the surface water storage deficit swsd soil moisture storage deficit smsd and groundwater storage deficit gwsd were calculated 2 3 4 uncertainty analysis assuming the solution uncertainty as the major contributor and neglecting the trend and glacial isostatic adjustment uncertainties the grace total uncertainty was calculated as the standard deviation of the estimated trends among different solutions li et al 2019b scanlon et al 2018 a similar procedure of standard deviation was used for precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture and temperature since sws consists of only the observed data based on the literature abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 a linearly interpolated mean monthly uncertainty of 2 3 28 8 from the highest to the lowest flow in the sws time series was considered and subsequently propagated to the trends following weighted least square regression long et al 2016 since all other components except gws of eq 4 were obtained from the independent data sources one sigma trend errors in gws were estimated by propagation through various water storage ws components Ï g w s Ï t w s 2 Ï s w s 2 Ï s m s 2 2 3 5 drought potential index dpi traditionally drought is defined solely by the deficit below normal conditions in climatic e g precipitation hydrological e g runoff or agricultural e g soil moisture variables occurring primarily due to the natural variabilities that are beyond the control of policymakers aghakouchak et al 2021 however in the complex human nature systems droughts termed anthropogenic droughts aghakouchak et al 2021 evolve due to the synergistic impact of natural and anthropogenic drivers which are generally difficult to disentangle rodell et al 2018 in this regard in addition to analyzing the drought behavior from various standardized indices a novel drought potential index dpi was devised based on the monthly time series of twsa following the effective water storage based approach first used by reager and famiglietti 2009 for estimating the flood potential for this aim firstly the monthly rates of the minimum required relative storage change s d e f t were calculated as below 6 s d e f t s m i n s t 1 where s m i n is the minimum twsa during the wet season in the study period 10 57 cm on oct 2015 and s t 1 is the twsa of the previous month t 1 to remove the effects of the regional hydrological heterogeneity and the average difference between the storage change and precipitation that may not always result in drought the normalized drought potential index was then obtained from the monthly drought potential amount dpa as follows 7 d p a t p a n o m t s d e f t 8 d p i t d p a t m i n d p a t where p a n o m t is the precipitation anomaly corresponding to the month t and dpa represents the difference in the deficit of the system s available water storage and precipitation water that sustains runoff or evapotranspiration owing to the precipitation influx dpi varies from 1 to 1 the closer it is to 1 the more drought is likely to occur in the regions like cprb where the compounding effects of the natural water variability and human activities are pronounced and crucial for sustainable water management dpi will enable us to quantitatively characterize the transition for the region to a drought prone situation which can evolve even during the wet season 3 results and discussion 3 1 tws based on grace fo the terrestrial water storage anomalies presented as basin averaged water depth mm or equivalent water volume km3 from the three grace solutions agreed well in terms of amplitude and dynamics fig 3 a and are highly consistent in terms of the pearson correlation r 0 95 and are following 1 1 line as shown in the scatter matrix fig s2 hence a combined twsa series was obtained by the tch method fig 3 for filling the gap in grace and grace fo records the ann bp ga model was run for various combinations of the predictors monthly time series the performance of the ann model improved as the number of predictors increased while keeping the precipitation major influx and soil moisture persistent previous studies e g long et al 2013 sun et al 2020 showed that the strong correlation of sms with grace twsa fig s3 all the model runs showed in fig s3 agree well with the observed twsa in terms of the seasonal phase moreover the coupled genetic algorithm eliminates the need for the trial and error method for determining the optimum number of the hidden neurons in the model setup the best performing model during the training r 0 96 nrmse 0 31 nse 0 90 using the five predictors viz gldas based twsa temperature evapotranspiration precipitation and soil moisture storage was used further for validation and prediction estimation phases the model showed a good agreement in the validation phase with r 0 94 nrmse 0 39 and nse 0 85 fig 3 b these results indicate that the proposed mlp bp ga model can be used not only to fill the data gaps between grace fo but also to forecast twsa ahead of the satellite data subject to the availability of the forecasted time series of various predictors 3 2 hydrological fluxes and water storage dynamics fig 4 a shows the monthly anomaly series of the ensemble mean precipitation p and evapotranspiration et and the respective spread of the values from various products composite annual cycles of p and et are shown in fig 5 two peaks can be observed in precipitation where the first swift peak during may can be attributed to the western monsoon onset and the second peak during august corresponds to the tropical rainfalls from the south china sea combined with the western monsoon rainfall in the basin south winds and northeast monsoon contribute to the marginal rain in the non monsoon season the high fluctuations in the monthly precipitation emphasize the significance of seasonal monsoon and non monsoon and intra annual precipitation throughout the year fig 6 the minimum of the precipitation anomaly is relatively constant during the dry season with a deficiency of 11 cm throughout the study period which can be explained by the reason that the basin receives only 10 of the precipitation during the dry season i e from november to april figs 4 5 monthly twsa over the chao phraya river basin varies from 31 81 cm may 2020 to 42 86 cm oct 2011 with a similar seasonal dynamic during the study period fig 4 b the basin experienced a decreasing trend of 1 12 0 05 cm yr 1 equivalent to a volumetric trend of 1 79 0 08 km3 yr 1 in twsa from sept 2002 to aug 2020 decreasing trends in precipitation 1 5 increasing air temperature 6 4 fig s4 increasing evapotranspiration 10 21 consistent with the global increase in et by 10 2 as reported by pascolini campbell et al 2021 relative to their long term means and their seasonal variations have partly contributed to the decrease of tws further to quantify the effects of the reservoir water management we analyzed the water storage in major dam reservoirs which showed similar dynamics and 15 amplitude of twsa fig s5 a time lag of up to two months from twsa is due to the travel time of the runoff to the reservoirs linear decreasing trends 0 40 0 03 cm yr 1 or 0 64 0 05 km3 yr 1 in total surface water including dam water storage from eleven dams fig 1 flood inundation water depth and river water storage explains about 36 of twsa trends in the basin soil moisture storage and groundwater storage show the long term linear trend of decrease at the rate of 0 21 0 02 cm yr 1 0 34 0 03 km3 yr 1 and 0 51 0 06 cm yr 1 0 82 0 10 km3 yr 1 which are about 19 and 45 respectively of the total twsa trend the soil moisture storage is slightly decreasing 5 in the region primarily due to the increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation high fluctuations in sms are evident during the 2011 flood and 2015 drought years respectively fig 4 b further analysis of the residuals of p et and ws components using the esmd approach fig s6 reveals the footprints of major flood and drought events in the basin a convex shape is found in tws sms and sws during the period of 2006 2013 due to the water surplus and two major flood events during this period gws has been continuously decreasing throughout the study period with much steep decline in recent years fig s6 which can be explained by the joint influence of long term droughts pumping induced localized declines and seasonal and inter annual water table fluctuations our findings of highly declining trends in gws are consistent with the annual groundwater reports by the department of groundwater resources thailand when compared qualitatively with the basin wide gw level depth data decline as much as 50 cm yr 1 the gw level varies from being fairly constant in a few wells to a huge decline of several meters in the majority of wells in recent years supplementary text s2 and fig s7 thus groundwater storage plays a major role in tws in the basin albeit the observed behavior needs to be further investigated in the future all the water storage components follow similar temporal dynamics with different annual amplitudes as revealed by the 18 year composite intra annual cycle fig 5 sms and gws have a lag of two and three months in minima with precipitation while their maxima are in a lag of zero and two months respectively fig 5 this lag time behavior can be primarily explained by the synergistic influence of the inherent vadose zone processes e g infiltration percolation etc and human water abstractions instances of variations in the lag months between precipitation and sms or gws e g 2011 2015 can mostly be caused by the monthly variations of the precipitation and subsequent changes in water withdrawal and usage behavior especially during the years of droughts or floods fig 4 since tws integrates sws sms and gws it attains the maxima and minima in between these components and with a variable lag time of one to three months figs 4 and 5 all the water storage components show a dampened response to precipitation due to the prevailing hydrological processes in the surface and subsurface systems smaller amplitudes in the anomalies fig 4 b and detection of the more acute decreasing trends in the ws components than that of precipitation fig 6 during the recent periods also highlight the weakening hydrological cycle in cprb to ascertain this situation storage deficit and surplus in various water storage components were calculated after removing the respective climatology for each month as per eq 5 results reveal the prolonged persistence of the gws deficit or surplus conditions as compared to the smsd fig 4 c gwsd has continuously been negative from apr 2014 until recently while smsd has experienced a minor recovery phase during 2018 signatures of major floods and drought events are evident in all the ws components with varying magnitudes and persistence fig 4 c monsoon precipitation and water abstractions were the controlling factors of recovery and depletion respectively of various ws components 3 3 seasonal analysis of net precipitation and tws change to further analyze the seasonal variations in net precipitation p et and tws we compared the anomaly of annual total p et and annual mean twsa during the monsoon season from may to october for precipitation and from july to december for tws fig 6 and corresponding percentage changes during the study period fig s8 an average lag of two months was observed in tws from precipitation and hence was taken into consideration twsa well captures the hydroclimatic extremes in the basin in response to the precipitation heterogeneities during the monsoon seasons of 2010 and 2011 the basin received an excess of 40 27 and 54 29 net precipitation which resulted in a 99 increase in the tws during the severe flood year 2011 fig s8 although the net annual precipitation during the monsoon season in 2011 is comparable to other years e g 2010 and 2017 fig 6 the flood of 2011 was amplified by the anomalously high rainfall in the pre monsoon season in 2011 bar graphs in fig 6 along with the frequent tropical storms from the northern pacific ocean between june to october in the basin thai meteorological department 2011 the flood intensity was further exaggerated by the year long relatively high soil moisture content along with the elevated sea level height in the gulf of thailand partly constraining the basin s drainage promchote et al 2016 rakwatin et al 2013 a large decline in tws in 2010 can be explained by the larger negative anomaly of gws in 2010 affected by the smallest non monsoon precipitation during nov 2009 to apr 2010 bar graphs in fig 6 and higher temperature and evapotranspiration in 2010 fig 4 a s4 such effects of the seasonal variations in precipitation on tws dynamics can also be seen during 2003 2004 years 2016 and 2017 also received above average net rainfall 22 31 and 39 87 respectively which led to a positive change of 32 70 in tws which was still negative compared to the long term mean of tws in the monsoon season fig s8 the drought of 2015 along with other drought events is evident in twsa fig 4 b and 6 the largest deficit in the precipitation was observed during the years 2015 48 49 2019 34 35 and 2014 25 17 which correspond to the relative tws deficits of 101 1 103 2 44 77 respectively an opposite behavior is observed during the years of 2003 2004 2010 twsa showed 56 31 39 81 54 61 while precipitation 35 93 23 90 and 27 07 respectively this inconsistency can most likely be attributed to the antecedent precipitation and water availability especially surface water which in turn affects the gw withdrawals patterns this variability in tws highlights insufficient storage in the system and hence employing water conservation practices e g rainwater harvesting in the basin is of paramount importance moreover since the atmospheric circulation assessed by the regression analysis of southern oscillation index soi and niÃ±o 3 4 explains only about 12 and 18 variance in twsa respectively and are weakly correlated with r 0 34 and 0 42 fig s9 human abstractions seem to be significant factor governing the water storage dynamics in the region which needs to be further investigated in future multiscalar studies using various statistical and dynamical models and in situ data moreover the recent period of continuous deficit in tws when combined with the persistent deficiency in the precipitation may lead to a transition to a drought prone situation in the basin similarly the likely occurrence of the floods in response to the continuous heavy precipitation e g one experienced in 2011 in the basin has direct implications on the better reservoir management practices or the irrigation water allocation plans in the basin temporal patterns of depletion and recovery in different storage components tws in particular help to assess the evolution of the hydro climatic extremes in the basin and to better manage the prevailing water resources the depletion and recovery behavior of tws in the basin in response to the wet and dry cycles defined according to the 12 month moving average of the net precipitation flux fig 7 seems to be primarily controlled by the variable water influx in the system in response to the dry and wet cycles which in turn affects the human abstractions a total of four and three events of multiyear depletion and recovery respectively were quantified in the basin tws depleted 48 km3 from sept 2002 to may 2005 followed by a short recovery 12 km3 until june 2006 while remaining almost stable until nov 2008 fig 7 and table s1 a deficit in the precipitation flux 17 14 combined with the most likely increase in gw pumping during 2009 lead to a depletion of 22 km3 until may 2010 which was recovered by 26 km3 after receiving an excess of cumulative precipitation flux 95 in the two consecutive years after the 2011 flood the basin suffered from the dry phase with a short wet phase during 2013 until mid 2016 which led to a depletion of 32 km3 in the basin the depletion rate was slowest 0 63 km3 month 1 due to the stringent irrigation regulations during this period a slow recovery of 17 km3 from jan 2016 to oct 2018 was followed by the highest depletion until aug 2020 with a rate of 1 8 km3 month 1 fig 7 in general the basin s aquifer system has fast depletion rates due to the less net influx and large dependence on groundwater to supplement the deficit of surface water especially during drought years e g 2018 2020 fig 7 and table s1 moreover the steepest decline in tws in recent times is alarming for another severe drought in the basin if the precipitation remains average or below average in the subsequent year s 3 4 monthly surplus and deficits in tws the monthly deficits and surplus of tws were investigated to reveal the factors affecting the depletion of tws in recent periods fig s10 depicts the monthly water storage surplus and deficit of tws relative to monthly climatology during the past 18 years sept 2002 to aug 2020 total monthly deficit and surplus events are almost equal 107 and 109 events respectively in the basin but the distribution is highly variable during the study period fig 4 c and s10 the basin mostly experienced a water storage surplus until mar 2014 with some short lasting deficit events mainly during the dry periods of 2004 2005 2007 and 2010 or prolonged until the wet seasons augmented by large seasonal variation in precipitation at some instances e g 2010 during the period from sept 2002 until march 2014 the maximum duration of continuous deficits was one year from nov 2009 to oct 2010 while the surplus events lasted as long as 19 months from mar 2011 to oct 2012 centering the flood year of 2011 since april 2014 the basin was getting dried continuously with an occurrence of about 63 deficit events during this period with a minimum of 20 cm in july 2020 although there has been a peak in rainfall during august 2019 the average during the year s rainy season was 34 less than the average of long term monsoon precipitation which resulted in 103 decrease in tws during the year there was no distinct annual distribution except for a slightly higher number of surplus months during monsoon and post monsoon season of the monthly deficit or surplus events since the majority of the extreme events are spanning over multiple years 3 5 drought propagation behavior to analyze the behavior of drought evolution and propagation from meteorological to agricultural and the system s total water storage a number of standardized indices viz standardized precipitation index spi12 scanlon et al 2015 standardized soil moisture index ssmi das et al 2020 and water storage index wsi sun et al 2018 were calculated and inter compared as shown in fig 8 spi and ssmi have a high correlation r 0 74 with a lag time of two months twsd based normalized wsi has a strong correlation r 0 69 and zero month lag with ssmi but moderate correlation r 0 56 and a lag of one month with spi12 this implies that the meteorological drought takes two months to reach the soil moisture and also to reflect in the water storage drought the difference in the lag months between spi12 and ssmi two months and that between spi12 and wsi one month can be attributed to the effect of the groundwater storage possibly more pumping in response to the less precipitation since tws is incorporating the gws along with sms these findings of the drought propagation in cprb are consistent with those reported by gevaert et al 2018 by employing an ensemble of global hydrological models the drought propagation time and the relative magnitude of the transformation from the meteorological drought to the water storage droughts in the basin can be utilized for engineering design and planning of the early warning systems for floods and droughts and may additionally constrain the hydroclimate extremes variability in future climate scenarios all three indices show similar inter annual dynamics and amplitudes from sept 2002 to aug 2020 except for the three instances in 2004 2011 and 2017 fig 8 during which periods wsi showed a weak correlation with spi and ssmi from apr 2004 to november 2004 wsi kept highly increasing compared to spi and ssmi while during jan 2017 to jan 2018 wsi kept sporadically decreasing unlike spi and ssmi which were increasing during the period in 2011 a long duration of high spi relatively small positive values of ssmi and a shorter peak in wsi can be seen this behavior can most likely be explained by the variations in the release of the water from the two major reservoirs in the basin namely sirikit capacity 9 5 billion m3 and bhumibol capacity 13 5 billion m3 dams along with alterations in the groundwater abstraction during the extreme drought e g 2017 2018 or flood e g 2011 events 3 6 drought analysis using dpi to further ascertain the water storage deficit trends the basin s drought potential was assessed by the new drought potential index based on the concept of the effective water storage availability in the basin at a given time the normalized drought potential index dpi being the direct indicator of the basin s water storage deficiency represents the integrated drought potential in the basin the dry season nov to apr is the main period of drought in the basin as illustrated by the dpi dynamics in fig 9 while dpi attains a minimum value of 0 94 during the peak flood of 2011 when twsa is maximum 42 86 cm both values for oct 2011 it attains a maximum value of 1 in may 2016 although the minimum twsa occurred in may 2020 31 81 cm this difference can be explained by the fact that unlike tws which is the integrated water storage estimate at any month dpi reveals the excess water minimum required relative storage change that sustains runoff or evapotranspiration in the basin figs 9 and s11 thus dpi helps to gain insights into the tendency of the basin to experience droughts that could not be analyzed merely by monthly twsa series an increasing trend of dpi highlights the greater drought potential in the chao phraya river basin from sept 2002 to aug 2020 fig 9 also the continuous higher values of dpi including both maxima and minima in recent years indicate the most likely occurrence of a drought event and indicate the possible transition of the basin towards a drought prone region during the dry season the storage in the dam reservoir is substantially important even if twsa is low for example in 2015 cprb experienced an extremely severe drought and farmers were forced to stop irrigation in this year both twsa and dam storage were very low not only in the dry season but also in the wet season fig s5 in 2018 although the minimum level of twsa is similar to 2015 no serious drought occurred because the dam storage was larger due to excess rainfall in 2017 fig s5 since 2019 drought conditions are continuing as illustrated by tws and dam storage in fig s5 from fig 9 both 2015 and 2019 show relatively larger dpi minima slightly below 0 which have never happened in previous years so we infer that apart from the general tendency of the basin to experience a drought in the long term and prevailing drought situation in dry periods dpi is also useful for identifying elevated drought potential in the wet season which otherwise could not be captured in other standardized indices the normalized drought potential index dpi accounts for the regional hydrological variability by removing the typical difference between water storage and precipitation anomaly and thus presents a basin wide holistic estimate of the prevailing drought conditions the high storage deficit i e large negative deficit value combined with the high negative precipitation anomaly indicates the high probability of the drought dpi is also unaffected by the short lasting high fluctuations in the precipitation e g torrential rain and rather presents the effect of the persistent precipitation trend on the regional scale since it represents the tendency of the basin for the likelihood of hydroclimatic extremes based on the preceding water storage conditions it can support the forecasting of droughts at a much accurate level when combined with the precipitation projections the grace fo derived dpi is highly reliable for the long term assessment of the water deficit situation in the basin rather than the short term analysis droughts with higher dpi are evident in the inter annual profiles of precipitation and twsa which enables dpi to assess the severe droughts more accurately than the mild droughts since the proposed dpi is capable of recording the regional event of hydroclimatic extremes along with the annual variability it will be valuable for the improved basin scale drought predictions a continuous deficit in the precipitation may lead to higher dpi and should be confirmed with the monthly tws deficits in the study region because dpi considers the water storage based on the precipitation for calculating the monthly drought potential amount also the longer the grace fo based twsa data is the better is the dpi s performance in representing the prevailing hydrological characteristics of the basin 3 7 institutional interventions for sustainable water utilities decreasing trends in various water storage components especially groundwater seem to be triggered during the drought years partly by the variable precipitation and partly by the integrated impact of less recharge and high water demand leading to the amplified pumping figs s7 and s12 further the increasing tendency of the basin to experience prolonged droughts and floods due to the highly variable precipitation may impose threats to the food production health and livelihood of the people and the economy as groundwater levels are going down there is a strong likelihood to shift the reliance on the deeper wells which may further affect several processes firstly digging deeper wells may not alleviate water scarcity due to the poor gw quality in deep aquifers secondly it might enhance the water availability gap between the various economic classes of society jasechko and perrone 2021 thirdly it may exaggerate the existing land subsidence issues in and around highly urbanized cities e g bangkok babel et al 2006 and may further extend to other developing areas therefore to ensure the equitable share and reliability of the groundwater based water supply a multifaceted strategy for efficient management inclusive governance and effective policymaking for groundwater sustainability is imperative in the basin amid a transition from a historical center of rice production to the current water scarce conditions the prevailing complex institutional environment of the chao phraya river basin with different agencies having different roles at various administrative levels and in multiple stages of water resources development storage and distribution needs to be understood because in this critical phase every small change in the hydrological situation can heavily impact the socio economic conditions of the basin https fdmt iwlearn org for example had there been ample time and accurate assessment of the flood in 2011 an early monsoon release of water albeit uncommon from the bhumibol and sirikit reservoirs would have enabled storing about one billion cubic meter floodwater in these reservoirs during the flooding event as pointed out by komori et al 2012 alarming deforestation rates due to urbanization and farmland exploitation have lowered the soil s water retaining capacity and therefore increases the risk of soil erosion flash floods and landslides https fdmt iwlearn org the resulting low infiltration percolation and subsequent pollution to near surface water resources might have intensified the overreliance on groundwater for irrigation ultimately leading to the decreasing terrestrial water storage trends in the basin to maintain sustainable water utilities against the observed weakening hydrological cycle in the region the promotion of institutional interventions to ensure sound hydrological cycles is of paramount importance in addition to the ongoing groundwater recharge projects http www dgr go th water conservation practices focused on the demand side such as switching from more water intense e g rice to less water intensive and commercial crops and or upgrading the irrigation systems to more efficient ones should be promoted to ensure the uninterrupted and efficient water supply in future the large declining trends of tws and its constituent components as revealed in the current assessment indicate an imbalance in withdrawals and replenishment rates in various water storage components and underscore the need to either revising the existing multilateral cooperation among various stakeholders or effective and efficient policymaking regulating the new settlements and water allocation strategies especially in the regions with existing complex water management despite the presence of a dense network of flood control and water storing measures e g dikes levees reservoirs etc the multiple drought and flood events experienced in cprb highlight the need for revising the approach for managing the hydroclimatic extremes while giving the associated risks of the ecosystem degradations a due consideration analyses of individual water storage components enhanced drought potential by dpi and drought propagation behavior by various standardized indices in this study are expected to provide a new perspective for revising the overlapping water management strategies among a plethora of governing agencies in the basin 4 conclusion driven from the high vulnerability of the chao phraya river basin to water related disasters i e floods and droughts we attempted to quantify the water storage dynamics by integrating the grace fo based terrestrial water storage global and local hydrological datasets and multiple drought indices major findings of the study are summarized as below 1 reasonably good performance of the proposed model training r 0 96 nse 0 90 validation r 0 94 nse 0 85 indicates its potential not only for filling the data gap between grace and grace fo records but also for filling the intermittent data gaps in grace fo occurring due to the battery management practices moreover the genetic algorithm when coupled with the ann model ann bp ga eliminates the need for the trial and error method prevalent to determine the hidden layers in the ann models 2 effects of all the drought and flood events in cprb are evident in the twsa series with high fluctuations during the major flood event of 2011 and drought events of 2015 and 2019 which is still continuing twsa has multiyear depletion and recovery events from 2002 to 2020 with surplus water storage until march 2014 this framework of quantifying various hydro climatic extremes using multisource data products can be adopted to various data scarce regions globally 3 groundwater storage is the dominant component 45 of declining tws trends followed by surface water storage 36 and soil moisture storage 19 these trends especially in gws provide a quantitative evaluation of groundwater resources in the region which otherwise due to the limited in situ data pumping gw table aquifer properties etc impedes the holistic assessment of the water beneath our feet results of the current study may provide an observational constraint and basis for employing early water management initiatives not only in the cprb but in other regions e g india where there is overreliance though often unreported due to lack of documentation or stringent measures among other reasons on groundwater resources 4 detection of the decreasing trend in groundwater storage which is probably more acute than the decrease change in precipitation through the application of grace and other auxiliary multisource products highlights the need for swift policy change to reduce the water demand e g encouraging less water intense crops decrease the dependence on groundwater and increase the implementation of the new groundwater recharge projects in the basin and provides a blueprint for similar studies in the data scarce basin to get insights of the commonly invisible groundwater 5 the lag time between various standardized indices helped to understand the drought propagation through various components of the system which will help in efficiently employing the early warning measures of the water management in the likelihood of water related extremes in the region 6 the highest deficit in the available water storage and the precipitation during the wet season as revealed by the drought potential index dpi indicate the early signs of the region s transition to a drought prone situation the crux of dpi is that it incorporates combined effects of the climate variability and human activities water management policymaking etc and can be applied to holistically quantify the potential of the development of the anthropogenic droughts in coupled human nature systems globally with implications for both short and long term water resources planning and management water governance and policymaking dpi can also be effectively utilized for identifying droughts during wet seasons employing the optimal adaptation measures and multilateral water management policymaking and efficient water allocation strategies in the data scarce river basins globally the cprb has been under a continuously increasing water stress since april 2014 as revealed by the water storage deficit analysis and the increasing trend in the proposed dpi the current framework when jointly used with precipitation and evapotranspiration forecasting and the adaptive reservoir operation rule curves kompor et al 2020 can help in developing the early warning systems for floods and droughts that will efficiently sustain the basin s socio economic activities since the grace fo represents the integrated water storage in a region when combined with the proposed mlp bp ga neural network and climate forecasting potential periods of hydro climatic extremes can be predicted with a lag time of several weeks to months cheng et al 2020 future satellite data of terrestrial water and continuously developing land surface models along with the ground based data will further enable us to assess the water storage dynamics and subsequent floods and droughts at a higher spatiotemporal resolution the separate assessment of anthropogenic impacts i e groundwater abstraction and reservoir management and climate variabilities on water storage dynamics in the basin will also be carried out in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4119,a holistic assessment of the hydroclimatic extremes which have caused tremendous environmental societal and economic losses globally is imperative for the highly vulnerable chao phraya river basin in this study the water storage dynamics and extremes in the basin during 2002 2020 were quantified for the first time using grace follow on based terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa with the help of a novel artificial neural network based model for the data gap filling twsa showed a linear trend of 1 12 0 05 cm yr 1 equivalent to a volumetric trend of 1 79 0 08 km3 yr 1 in the basin and segregation of the constituent components of tws revealed that the groundwater storage is a significant contributor 45 to tws with a linear trend of 0 51 0 06 cm yr 1 0 82 0 10 km3 yr 1 followed by surface water storage i e cumulative of the water storage in the reservoirs flood inundation and rivers 36 and soil moisture storage 19 the hydroclimatic extremes detected in twsa are primarily triggered by the variations in precipitation during the monsoon season may to october and further amplified by the subsequent water storage and abstraction twsa attained a maximum of 42 86 cm in october 2011 during severe floods of 2011 95 increase in net precipitation during 2010 and 2011 and a minimum of 31 81 cm during the drought of may 2020 82 decrease in net precipitation during 2019

geographical area the chao phraya river basin cprb is the most important basin in thailand in terms of agriculture economics and livelihood in general abhishek and kinouchi 2021a shakti et al 2020 the basin is home to around 40 of the country s population over 45 of the basin is used for agriculture which depends on the highly heterogeneous rainfall derived primarily from the asian summer monsoon komolafe et al 2019 onwrc 2006 despite the availability of vast water resources the high vulnerability to the minor shifts in the monsoon patterns and variable human interventions i e reservoir management and water abstractions govern the water resource dynamics and agricultural productivity in the basin supplementary fig s1 continuously increasing stress on the prevailing water resources is a major challenge in the basin especially in terms of the water quantity available in the dry periods which may ultimately disrupt the water demand supply cycle and limit the crop production kinouchi

economies through supply chain disruptions shakti et al 2020 although some studies dealing with the specific extreme events particularly the 2011 flood event in the basin have been conducted in the past e g hagiwara et al 2016 komolafe et al 2019 promchote et al 2016 sayama et al 2017 tau chia et al 2015 a comprehensive study covering both floods and droughts under the integrated impact of both natural and anthropogenic influences and focusing on the various components of the water storage is still lacking moreover an increasing and decreasing trend in monsoonand dry season precipitation 20 each respectively and an increase in the peak precipitation amount in the wet season from past and near future 2010 2039 to the far future 2070 2099 period as reported by supharatid 2015 highlight a possibility of an increase inthe water related extremes in the basin therefore a holistic assessment of the hydro climatic extremes their propagation behavior along with the dynamics of terrestrial water storage tws and its constituent components is imperative to better understand the hydrological complexity of the basin and for employing an efficient and effective strategy to mitigate the socio economic impact of these water related disasters apart from the societal and economic importance terrestrial water plays a vital role in earth system processes including climate weather and biogeochemical cycles seyoum and milewski 2017 thus understanding the tws dynamics is not only essential for human life but also crucial for assessing the water cycle planning policymaking and other management strategies for water resources in a changing climate and for a continuously increasing population papa et al 2015 scanlon et al 2018 wada et al 2014 terrestrial water storage which represents the water storage in soil moisture surface water biomass and groundwater is a decisive component of the hydrologic cycle in any river basin improved quantification of tws is pivotal in understanding the regional water cycle which ultimately helps to allocate govern and manage the basin scale water resources efficiently and effectively ndehedehe et al 2016 although the conventional way of quantifying the various hydrological as well as water storage components includes ground based data the inherent limitations leading to the infrequent data lengths on the fine spatial scales usually impede an accurate continuous and integrative assessment for the river basins globally abhishek and kinouchi 2021b nevertheless the past gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and the ongoing grace follow on both jointly referred to as grace fo hereafter a tandem satellite mission initially launched in march 2002 enable us to measure the earth s mass distribution and subsequently quantify the changes in tws with unprecedented accuracy chen et al 2020 tapley et al 2019 outperforming a variety of remotely sensed data that primarily focus on few components of water storage grace fo derived tws has the least uncertainties on a basin size of 100 000 km2 at the current processing level and thus provides a big picture of the water storage famiglietti et al 2015 some studies have

al 2010 in various regions globally to the best of our knowledge however no work has been done utilizing the grace fo to analyze the dynamics of the terrestrial water storage tws and segregated constituent components in the chao phraya river basin where frequent floods and droughts have been affecting various human activities moreover the sparse and infrequent measurement of groundwater gw in addition to overreliance on gw by registered and unregistered wells especially during dry periods potentially limit appropriate monitoring and assessment of gw resources leading to the continuous unsustainable abstraction which eventually may lead to significant depletion of the commonly invisible gw in this study therefore we jointly used grace satellite data with the land surface models

basin and analyze the effect of the policy change for water management essentially among groundwater and surface water due to the climatic shift to a warmer temperature rapid industrialization and urbanization and intense agricultural practices the intensity frequency and extent of the hydroclimatic extremes i e droughts and floods are expected to increase in the near future with relatively severe consequences attributed to the region s high dependency on water resources amnuaylojaroen and chanvichit 2019 ipcc 2007 supharatid 2015 tangang et al 2020 cprb has likely been shifting from a state of water richness towards water scarcity conditions making the basin more vulnerable to minor variations in the hydrological cycle kiguchi et al 2021 supharatid 2015 given the highly variable climate conditions and continually increasing urbanization and the subsequent extreme hydrological conditions costing billions of dollars to the economy and a key economic and policymaking role in southeast asia kiguchi et al 2021 sound knowledge of the basin scale hydrologic cycle is crucial in this paper therefore we quantify the terrestrial water storage dynamics in the basin and attempt to get insights into the ability of the satellite data jointly used with land surface models and artificial neural networks to capture the flood and drought events the variability of tws and its constituent components and their propagation behavior through the system will enable us to understand the hydrological footprints for supporting sustainable decisions on a necessary adaptation of the human activities e g updating the reservoir rule curves revising the groundwater pumping regulations in the basin the remaining of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 salient features of the study area data types and their sources and various methods used and proposed in the study are presented section 3 includes the results and discussion of different analyses of the study along with the discussion of institutional interventions for ensuring a sound hydrological cycle in the basin finally the concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the chao phraya river basin fig 1 is primarily an agrarian basin agricultural lands covering over 90 of the basin with a geographical area of 160 000 km2 and a population of 30 million onwrc 2006 https fdmt iwlearn org the southern part of cprb is a low lying area with an elevation of as low as 2 5 m above mean sea level msl fig 1 making it susceptible to large flooding events the basin s climate is dominated by tropical monsoons with a mean and maximum daily temperature of 27 c and 40 c respectively the basin receives an average annual rainfall of 150 cm varying between 100 and 200 cm from the western to eastern parts about 90 of the rainfall is received in the monsoon season from may to october which generates an average runoff of 25 45 cm in the basin 85 of which occurs in july to december komolafe et al 2019 tau chia et al 2015 due to the absence of ample rainfall after the onset of the dry season during the first half of the year i e from january to june natural flows generally remain small which leads to an intermittent shift of dependence from surface water to groundwater for meeting various water demands in the basin subject to the prevailing water availability and the related policies 2 2 data used due to the lack of a sufficiently dense and uniform observation network of in situ data in the basin and the insufficient record length and intermittent and frequent gaps in the limited ground data we accessed the auxiliary datasets of weather and water storage ws components from various remote sensing products and land surface models although the output fields from nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas agree favorably well with the other model products and observed data rodell et al 2015 the ensemble mean of the multisource data products for the weather data depending on the time range of available data was used to characterize the uncertainty and to avoid implicit biases in a single dataset li et al 2019a long et al 2014b as described below 2 2 1 weather data precipitation the main water influx to any region plays a vital role in regional water balance and hydrological modeling chen et al 2017 xie et al 2019 we used an average of the precipitation data from trmm 3b43 version7 i e tropical rainfall measuring mission that is a joint mission by nasa and jaxa gpcp era5 merra 2 and chirps chen et al 2020 gelaro et al 2017 funk et al 2015 hersbach et al 2020 huffman et al 2009 trmm 2011 the study area does not receive any snowfall hence this component was excluded from the analysis evapotranspiration the major outflux in a region is an indispensable component and also one of the most scarcely measured variables which is difficult to ground reference primarily due to the high non closure of energy budget and micrometeorological flux measurements footprints xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 therefore the average of evapotranspiration products from three different categories land surface model lsm gldas noah v2 1 beaudoing and rodell 2020 satellite gleam v3 5a martens et al 2017 reanalysis merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 was used to get reliable and unbiased estimates of evapotranspiration over the study region ensemble mean of the monthly values of basin wide near surface air temperature were obtained from the gldas noah archive and merra 2 reanalysis dataset gelaro et al 2017 2 2 2 water storage components data we used the past grace data availability april 2002 to june 2017 and current grace fo data availability june 2018 to present satellite data from the three processing centers namely center for space research csr geoforschungszentrum gfz and jet propulsion laboratory jpl from sept 2002 to aug 2020 a combination of the spherical harmonics sh from gfz and mascons from jpl and csr was used to derive the combined time series of the basin averaged terrestrial water storage tws time series ferreira et al 2016 long et al 2014b uncertainties associated with the post processing of the grace gravity data has been reduced continuously and are at a minimum for the latest grace fo data which has resulted in reasonably good agreement between the various grace derived variables and those estimated from other hydrologic models chen et al 2020 owing to the improved accuracy over the model dependent methods multiplicative additive and scaling the data driven model independent approach proposed by vishwakarma et al 2017 was used for the bias leakage correction in grace products all the processing steps for converting the grace fo satellite data to basin averaged monthly tws and for the subsequent corrections are described in several studies e g rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 2015 vishwakarma et al 2017 among others and are not repeated here for the soil moisture storage

river water storage and flood inundation depth data was obtained from sayama et al 2015 groundwater well data in terms of groundwater table data used for the qualitative comparison of the remotely sensed groundwater storage derived in this study was obtained from the department of groundwater resources http www dgr go th 2 3 methods to fulfill our objectives we first generated a continuous monthly time series of basin wide twsa using an ann model coupled with the genetic algorithm and quantified the linear and non linear decadal trends in various segregated and integrated components of the hydrological cycle and water storage then we evaluated various hydroclimatic extremes droughts and floods in the basin and conducted an empirical analysis of different drought indices to understand the drought propagation between various water storage components in the basin finally we proposed a novel drought potential index dpi to not only explore the long term trend in the basin s drought potential but also to examine the drought in the wet season considering both the natural variability in precipitation and human influences embedded in the water storage all the data sources and types along with the methodology and the various research components considered in this study are represented in fig 2 2 3 1 artificial neural network for overcoming the data gap of the grace fo records we hereby propose artificial neural network based models employing the multilayer perceptron mlp neural network with backpropagation bp and coupled with genetic algorithms ga mlp bp ga hereafter by taking advantage of the availability of the multisource ancillary data products and less complex configuration of ann compared to the recent complex deep learning models ann models have been utilized for a multitude of applications in water resources such as forecasting streamflow tongal and booij 2018 flood frequency analysis shu and ouarda 2007 rainfall runoff modeling nourani 2017 among others owing to their non parametric nature ann methods outperform the forecasting using the conventional hydro meteorological models particularly in the complex underlying processes shu and ouarda 2007 xie et al 2019 mlp neural network is one of the most widely used ann methods for predicting various hydro meteorological variables and subsequent water resources management chitsazan et al 2015 long et al 2014a long et al 2014b seyoum and milewski 2017 xie et al 2019 the feed forward network using the hyperbolic tangent activation function a sigmoidal function with a range of 1 1 was used the tested predictors include the combinations of soil moisture air temperature evapotranspiration and the output is terrestrial water storage the network has three layer types i e the input layer the hidden layer consisting of many neurons defining the weighted sum of the various predictors and the output layer fig 2 due to the less elapsed time in the convergence a levenberg marquardt backpropagation algorithm was used in this study further we employed a genetic algorithm with an optimization function to minimize the root mean square error and maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient to decide the optimum number of hidden neurons maier et al 2014 which turned out to be five in the current study the ga thus prevents the mlp bp ga model from either over fitting or under fitting the functional relationship between the predictors and the output we used initial 178 values of twsa i e 87 of the total 205 available monthly values from sept 2002 to jun 2017 for training the model and the remaining 27 values i e 13 from jun 2018 to aug 2020 for validation purpose furthermore the model performance was evaluated during the training and validation using a number of statistical parameters including pearson correlation coefficient r normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient mathematically these parameters are defined as below 1 r i 1 n x m i x m i x o i x o i i 1 n x m i x m i 2 i 1 n x o i x o i 2 2 n r m s e i 1 n x m i x o i 2 i 1 n x o i 2 3 n s e 1 i 1 n x m i x o i 2 i 1 n x o i x o i 2 where n is the number of months which are different for different runs of training and testing x m i and x o i are the modeled and observed twsa respectively for the ith month x mi and x oi are the average of the modeled and observed twsa time series lastly the twsa for the eleven missing months july 2017 to may 2018 was estimated using the trained and validated model recurring gaps of 1 2 months at every 5 6 months due to the active battery management after 2011 were filled by linear interpolation of the two bounding values abhishek and kinouchi 2021b xie et al 2018 2 3 2 combined twsa time series and regional water balance we derived the combined terrestrial water storage time series using the three grace fo products namely csr m gfz sh and jpl m using the three cornered hat tch method which has recently been utilized in hydrology long et al 2014a although the ensemble mean of multiple time series is also used abhishek and kinouchi 2021a we adhere to the tch method which considers the uncertainties associated with the individual data series ferreira et al 2016 the combined tws series corresponding to the minimal noise variance is generated based on the common signals removal from the multiple data series abhishek and kinouchi 2021b chen et al 2019 koot et al 2006 since all of the water storage components are influenced by either climatic impacts or anthropogenic impacts or a combination of both the dynamics of each component need to be understood to assess how the water moves through the system aghakouchak et al 2021 scanlon et al 2015 therefore we segregated the individual water storage components of tws to better understand the imbalance between water inputs and outputs monthly tws can be written as the sum of all constituent components by 4 t w s s w s s m s g w s where s w s s m s and g w s are storage components corresponding to the surface water i e the water storage in the dam reservoirs flood inundation and rivers soil moisture and groundwater please note that all of the above water storage components and the climatic variables are basin averaged monthly time series anomalies relative to the long term mean of the individual time series and are represented as the equivalent water depth cm or as equivalent water volume km3 the basin wide river water storage data was obtained as the difference between catchment water storage and soil moisture following the green ampt g a model for 2002 2011 sayama et al 2015 and was estimated for 2012 2020 using the current mlp bp ga model with dam water storage water release from dams stream gauge data collected at nakhon sawan fig 1 tws and precipitation as predictors additionally the flood inundation depths simulated for 2002 2011 by the rainfall runoff inundation rri model sayama et al 2015 and estimated for 2012 2020 using the ann model were used lastly linear and non linear trends extreme point symmetric mode decomposition method supplementary text s1 were quantified 2 3 3 water storage deficits further we removed the monthly climatology from all the water storage components to get insights into the dynamics of each component and their contribution to flood and drought events for example the deficits and surplus in the terrestrial water storage were calculated as below 5 t w s d j k t w s a j k t w s a k where twsd is the terrestrial water storage deficit or surplus subscripts j and k represent the year and month respectively t w s a j k is the terrestrial water storage anomaly for the jth year and kth month and t w s a k is the average of monthly twsa over the period between september 2002 and august 2020 similarly the surface water storage deficit swsd soil moisture storage deficit smsd and groundwater storage deficit gwsd were calculated 2 3 4 uncertainty analysis assuming the solution uncertainty as the major contributor and neglecting the trend and glacial isostatic adjustment uncertainties the grace total uncertainty was calculated as the standard deviation of the estimated trends among different solutions li et al 2019b scanlon et al 2018 a similar procedure of standard deviation was used for precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture and temperature since sws consists of only the observed data based on the literature abolafia rosenzweig et al 2021 a linearly interpolated mean monthly uncertainty of 2 3 28 8 from the highest to the lowest flow in the sws time series was considered and subsequently propagated to the trends following weighted least square regression long et al 2016 since all other components except gws of eq 4 were obtained from the independent data sources one sigma trend errors in gws were estimated by propagation through various water storage ws components Ï g w s Ï t w s 2 Ï s w s 2 Ï s m s 2 2 3 5 drought potential index dpi traditionally drought is defined solely by the deficit below normal conditions in climatic e g precipitation hydrological e g runoff or agricultural e g soil moisture variables occurring primarily due to the natural variabilities that are beyond the control of policymakers aghakouchak et al 2021 however in the complex human nature systems droughts termed anthropogenic droughts aghakouchak et al 2021 evolve due to the synergistic impact of natural and anthropogenic drivers which are generally difficult to disentangle rodell et al 2018 in this regard in addition to analyzing the drought behavior from various standardized indices a novel drought potential index dpi was devised based on the monthly time series of twsa following the effective water storage based approach first used by reager and famiglietti 2009 for estimating the flood potential for this aim firstly the monthly rates of the minimum required relative storage change s d e f t were calculated as below 6 s d e f t s m i n s t 1 where s m i n is the minimum twsa during the wet season in the study period 10 57 cm on oct 2015 and s t 1 is the twsa of the previous month t 1 to remove the effects of the regional hydrological heterogeneity and the average difference between the storage change and precipitation that may not always result in drought the normalized drought potential index was then obtained from the monthly drought potential amount dpa as follows 7 d p a t p a n o m t s d e f t 8 d p i t d p a t m i n d p a t where p a n o m t is the precipitation anomaly corresponding to the month t and dpa represents the difference in the deficit of the system s available water storage and precipitation water that sustains runoff or evapotranspiration owing to the precipitation influx dpi varies from 1 to 1 the closer it is to 1 the more drought is likely to occur in the regions like cprb where the compounding effects of the natural water variability and human activities are pronounced and crucial for sustainable water management dpi will enable us to quantitatively characterize the transition for the region to a drought prone situation which can evolve even during the wet season 3 results and discussion 3 1 tws based on grace fo the terrestrial water storage anomalies presented as basin averaged water depth mm or equivalent water volume km3 from the three grace solutions agreed well in terms of amplitude and dynamics fig 3 a and are highly consistent in terms of the pearson correlation r 0 95 and are following 1 1 line as shown in the scatter matrix fig s2 hence a combined twsa series was obtained by the tch method fig 3 for filling the gap in grace and grace fo records the ann bp ga model was run for various combinations of the predictors monthly time series the performance of the ann model improved as the number of predictors increased while keeping the precipitation major influx and soil moisture persistent previous studies e g long et al 2013 sun et al 2020 showed that the strong correlation of sms with grace twsa fig s3 all the model runs showed in fig s3 agree well with the observed twsa in terms of the seasonal phase moreover the coupled genetic algorithm eliminates the need for the trial and error method for determining the optimum number of the hidden neurons in the model setup the best performing model during the training r 0 96 nrmse 0 31 nse 0 90 using the five predictors viz gldas based twsa temperature evapotranspiration precipitation and soil moisture storage was used further for validation and prediction estimation phases the model showed a good agreement in the validation phase with r 0 94 nrmse 0 39 and nse 0 85 fig 3 b these results indicate that the proposed mlp bp ga model can be used not only to fill the data gaps between grace fo but also to forecast twsa ahead of the satellite data subject to the availability of the forecasted time series of various predictors 3 2 hydrological fluxes and water storage dynamics fig 4 a shows the monthly anomaly series of the ensemble mean precipitation p and evapotranspiration et and the respective spread of the values from various products composite annual cycles of p and et are shown in fig 5 two peaks can be observed in precipitation where the first swift peak during may can be attributed to the western monsoon onset and the second peak during august corresponds to the tropical rainfalls from the south china sea combined with the western monsoon rainfall in the basin south winds and northeast monsoon contribute to the marginal rain in the non monsoon season the high fluctuations in the monthly precipitation emphasize the significance of seasonal monsoon and non monsoon and intra annual precipitation throughout the year fig 6 the minimum of the precipitation anomaly is relatively constant during the dry season with a deficiency of 11 cm throughout the study period which can be explained by the reason that the basin receives only 10 of the precipitation during the dry season i e from november to april figs 4 5 monthly twsa over the chao phraya river basin varies from 31 81 cm may 2020 to 42 86 cm oct 2011 with a similar seasonal dynamic during the study period fig 4 b the basin experienced a decreasing trend of 1 12 0 05 cm yr 1 equivalent to a volumetric trend of 1 79 0 08 km3 yr 1 in twsa from sept 2002 to aug 2020 decreasing trends in precipitation 1 5 increasing air temperature 6 4 fig s4 increasing evapotranspiration 10 21 consistent with the global increase in et by 10 2 as reported by pascolini campbell et al 2021 relative to their long term means and their seasonal variations have partly contributed to the decrease of tws further to quantify the effects of the reservoir water management we analyzed the water storage in major dam reservoirs which showed similar dynamics and 15 amplitude of twsa fig s5 a time lag of up to two months from twsa is due to the travel time of the runoff to the reservoirs linear decreasing trends 0 40 0 03 cm yr 1 or 0 64 0 05 km3 yr 1 in total surface water including dam water storage from eleven dams fig 1 flood inundation water depth and river water storage explains about 36 of twsa trends in the basin soil moisture storage and groundwater storage show the long term linear trend of decrease at the rate of 0 21 0 02 cm yr 1 0 34 0 03 km3 yr 1 and 0 51 0 06 cm yr 1 0 82 0 10 km3 yr 1 which are about 19 and 45 respectively of the total twsa trend the soil moisture storage is slightly decreasing 5 in the region primarily due to the increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation high fluctuations in sms are evident during the 2011 flood and 2015 drought years respectively fig 4 b further analysis of the residuals of p et and ws components using the esmd approach fig s6 reveals the footprints of major flood and drought events in the basin a convex shape is found in tws sms and sws during the period of 2006 2013 due to the water surplus and two major flood events during this period gws has been continuously decreasing throughout the study period with much steep decline in recent years fig s6 which can be explained by the joint influence of long term droughts pumping induced localized declines and seasonal and inter annual water table fluctuations our findings of highly declining trends in gws are consistent with the annual groundwater reports by the department of groundwater resources thailand when compared qualitatively with the basin wide gw level depth data decline as much as 50 cm yr 1 the gw level varies from being fairly constant in a few wells to a huge decline of several meters in the majority of wells in recent years supplementary text s2 and fig s7 thus groundwater storage plays a major role in tws in the basin albeit the observed behavior needs to be further investigated in the future all the water storage components follow similar temporal dynamics with different annual amplitudes as revealed by the 18 year composite intra annual cycle fig 5 sms and gws have a lag of two and three months in minima with precipitation while their maxima are in a lag of zero and two months respectively fig 5 this lag time behavior can be primarily explained by the synergistic influence of the inherent vadose zone processes e g infiltration percolation etc and human water abstractions instances of variations in the lag months between precipitation and sms or gws e g 2011 2015 can mostly be caused by the monthly variations of the precipitation and subsequent changes in water withdrawal and usage behavior especially during the years of droughts or floods fig 4 since tws integrates sws sms and gws it attains the maxima and minima in between these components and with a variable lag time of one to three months figs 4 and 5 all the water storage components show a dampened response to precipitation due to the prevailing hydrological processes in the surface and subsurface systems smaller amplitudes in the anomalies fig 4 b and detection of the more acute decreasing trends in the ws components than that of precipitation fig 6 during the recent periods also highlight the weakening hydrological cycle in cprb to ascertain this situation storage deficit and surplus in various water storage components were calculated after removing the respective climatology for each month as per eq 5 results reveal the prolonged persistence of the gws deficit or surplus conditions as compared to the smsd fig 4 c gwsd has continuously been negative from apr 2014 until recently while smsd has experienced a minor recovery phase during 2018 signatures of major floods and drought events are evident in all the ws components with varying magnitudes and persistence fig 4 c monsoon precipitation and water abstractions were the controlling factors of recovery and depletion respectively of various ws components 3 3 seasonal analysis of net precipitation and tws change to further analyze the seasonal variations in net precipitation p et and tws we compared the anomaly of annual total p et and annual mean twsa during the monsoon season from may to october for precipitation and from july to december for tws fig 6 and corresponding percentage changes during the study period fig s8 an average lag of two months was observed in tws from precipitation and hence was taken into consideration twsa well captures the hydroclimatic extremes in the basin in response to the precipitation heterogeneities during the monsoon seasons of 2010 and 2011 the basin received an excess of 40 27 and 54 29 net precipitation which resulted in a 99 increase in the tws during the severe flood year 2011 fig s8 although the net annual precipitation during the monsoon season in 2011 is comparable to other years e g 2010 and 2017 fig 6 the flood of 2011 was amplified by the anomalously high rainfall in the pre monsoon season in 2011 bar graphs in fig 6 along with the frequent tropical storms from the northern pacific ocean between june to october in the basin thai meteorological department 2011 the flood intensity was further exaggerated by the year long relatively high soil moisture content along with the elevated sea level height in the gulf of thailand partly constraining the basin s drainage promchote et al 2016 rakwatin et al 2013 a large decline in tws in 2010 can be explained by the larger negative anomaly of gws in 2010 affected by the smallest non monsoon precipitation during nov 2009 to apr 2010 bar graphs in fig 6 and higher temperature and evapotranspiration in 2010 fig 4 a s4 such effects of the seasonal variations in precipitation on tws dynamics can also be seen during 2003 2004 years 2016 and 2017 also received above average net rainfall 22 31 and 39 87 respectively which led to a positive change of 32 70 in tws which was still negative compared to the long term mean of tws in the monsoon season fig s8 the drought of 2015 along with other drought events is evident in twsa fig 4 b and 6 the largest deficit in the precipitation was observed during the years 2015 48 49 2019 34 35 and 2014 25 17 which correspond to the relative tws deficits of 101 1 103 2 44 77 respectively an opposite behavior is observed during the years of 2003 2004 2010 twsa showed 56 31 39 81 54 61 while precipitation 35 93 23 90 and 27 07 respectively this inconsistency can most likely be attributed to the antecedent precipitation and water availability especially surface water which in turn affects the gw withdrawals patterns this variability in tws highlights insufficient storage in the system and hence employing water conservation practices e g rainwater harvesting in the basin is of paramount importance moreover since the atmospheric circulation assessed by the regression analysis of southern oscillation index soi and niÃ±o 3 4 explains only about 12 and 18 variance in twsa respectively and are weakly correlated with r 0 34 and 0 42 fig s9 human abstractions seem to be significant factor governing the water storage dynamics in the region which needs to be further investigated in future multiscalar studies using various statistical and dynamical models and in situ data moreover the recent period of continuous deficit in tws when combined with the persistent deficiency in the precipitation may lead to a transition to a drought prone situation in the basin similarly the likely occurrence of the floods in response to the continuous heavy precipitation e g one experienced in 2011 in the basin has direct implications on the better reservoir management practices or the irrigation water allocation plans in the basin temporal patterns of depletion and recovery in different storage components tws in particular help to assess the evolution of the hydro climatic extremes in the basin and to better manage the prevailing water resources the depletion and recovery behavior of tws in the basin in response to the wet and dry cycles defined according to the 12 month moving average of the net precipitation flux fig 7 seems to be primarily controlled by the variable water influx in the system in response to the dry and wet cycles which in turn affects the human abstractions a total of four and three events of multiyear depletion and recovery respectively were quantified in the basin tws depleted 48 km3 from sept 2002 to may 2005 followed by a short recovery 12 km3 until june 2006 while remaining almost stable until nov 2008 fig 7 and table s1 a deficit in the precipitation flux 17 14 combined with the most likely increase in gw pumping during 2009 lead to a depletion of 22 km3 until may 2010 which was recovered by 26 km3 after receiving an excess of cumulative precipitation flux 95 in the two consecutive years after the 2011 flood the basin suffered from the dry phase with a short wet phase during 2013 until mid 2016 which led to a depletion of 32 km3 in the basin the depletion rate was slowest 0 63 km3 month 1 due to the stringent irrigation regulations during this period a slow recovery of 17 km3 from jan 2016 to oct 2018 was followed by the highest depletion until aug 2020 with a rate of 1 8 km3 month 1 fig 7 in general the basin s aquifer system has fast depletion rates due to the less net influx and large dependence on groundwater to supplement the deficit of surface water especially during drought years e g 2018 2020 fig 7 and table s1 moreover the steepest decline in tws in recent times is alarming for another severe drought in the basin if the precipitation remains average or below average in the subsequent year s 3 4 monthly surplus and deficits in tws the monthly deficits and surplus of tws were investigated to reveal the factors affecting the depletion of tws in recent periods fig s10 depicts the monthly water storage surplus and deficit of tws relative to monthly climatology during the past 18 years sept 2002 to aug 2020 total monthly deficit and surplus events are almost equal 107 and 109 events respectively in the basin but the distribution is highly variable during the study period fig 4 c and s10 the basin mostly experienced a water storage surplus until mar 2014 with some short lasting deficit events mainly during the dry periods of 2004 2005 2007 and 2010 or prolonged until the wet seasons augmented by large seasonal variation in precipitation at some instances e g 2010 during the period from sept 2002 until march 2014 the maximum duration of continuous deficits was one year from nov 2009 to oct 2010 while the surplus events lasted as long as 19 months from mar 2011 to oct 2012 centering the flood year of 2011 since april 2014 the basin was getting dried continuously with an occurrence of about 63 deficit events during this period with a minimum of 20 cm in july 2020 although there has been a peak in rainfall during august 2019 the average during the year s rainy season was 34 less than the average of long term monsoon precipitation which resulted in 103 decrease in tws during the year there was no distinct annual distribution except for a slightly higher number of surplus months during monsoon and post monsoon season of the monthly deficit or surplus events since the majority of the extreme events are spanning over multiple years 3 5 drought propagation behavior to analyze the behavior of drought evolution and propagation from meteorological to agricultural and the system s total water storage a number of standardized indices viz standardized precipitation index spi12 scanlon et al 2015 standardized soil moisture index ssmi das et al 2020 and water storage index wsi sun et al 2018 were calculated and inter compared as shown in fig 8 spi and ssmi have a high correlation r 0 74 with a lag time of two months twsd based normalized wsi has a strong correlation r 0 69 and zero month lag with ssmi but moderate correlation r 0 56 and a lag of one month with spi12 this implies that the meteorological drought takes two months to reach the soil moisture and also to reflect in the water storage drought the difference in the lag months between spi12 and ssmi two months and that between spi12 and wsi one month can be attributed to the effect of the groundwater storage possibly more pumping in response to the less precipitation since tws is incorporating the gws along with sms these findings of the drought propagation in cprb are consistent with those reported by gevaert et al 2018 by employing an ensemble of global hydrological models the drought propagation time and the relative magnitude of the transformation from the meteorological drought to the water storage droughts in the basin can be utilized for engineering design and planning of the early warning systems for floods and droughts and may additionally constrain the hydroclimate extremes variability in future climate scenarios all three indices show similar inter annual dynamics and amplitudes from sept 2002 to aug 2020 except for the three instances in 2004 2011 and 2017 fig 8 during which periods wsi showed a weak correlation with spi and ssmi from apr 2004 to november 2004 wsi kept highly increasing compared to spi and ssmi while during jan 2017 to jan 2018 wsi kept sporadically decreasing unlike spi and ssmi which were increasing during the period in 2011 a long duration of high spi relatively small positive values of ssmi and a shorter peak in wsi can be seen this behavior can most likely be explained by the variations in the release of the water from the two major reservoirs in the basin namely sirikit capacity 9 5 billion m3 and bhumibol capacity 13 5 billion m3 dams along with alterations in the groundwater abstraction during the extreme drought e g 2017 2018 or flood e g 2011 events 3 6 drought analysis using dpi to further ascertain the water storage deficit trends the basin s drought potential was assessed by the new drought potential index based on the concept of the effective water storage availability in the basin at a given time the normalized drought potential index dpi being the direct indicator of the basin s water storage deficiency represents the integrated drought potential in the basin the dry season nov to apr is the main period of drought in the basin as illustrated by the dpi dynamics in fig 9 while dpi attains a minimum value of 0 94 during the peak flood of 2011 when twsa is maximum 42 86 cm both values for oct 2011 it attains a maximum value of 1 in may 2016 although the minimum twsa occurred in may 2020 31 81 cm this difference can be explained by the fact that unlike tws which is the integrated water storage estimate at any month dpi reveals the excess water minimum required relative storage change that sustains runoff or evapotranspiration in the basin figs 9 and s11 thus dpi helps to gain insights into the tendency of the basin to experience droughts that could not be analyzed merely by monthly twsa series an increasing trend of dpi highlights the greater drought potential in the chao phraya river basin from sept 2002 to aug 2020 fig 9 also the continuous higher values of dpi including both maxima and minima in recent years indicate the most likely occurrence of a drought event and indicate the possible transition of the basin towards a drought prone region during the dry season the storage in the dam reservoir is substantially important even if twsa is low for example in 2015 cprb experienced an extremely severe drought and farmers were forced to stop irrigation in this year both twsa and dam storage were very low not only in the dry season but also in the wet season fig s5 in 2018 although the minimum level of twsa is similar to 2015 no serious drought occurred because the dam storage was larger due to excess rainfall in 2017 fig s5 since 2019 drought conditions are continuing as illustrated by tws and dam storage in fig s5 from fig 9 both 2015 and 2019 show relatively larger dpi minima slightly below 0 which have never happened in previous years so we infer that apart from the general tendency of the basin to experience a drought in the long term and prevailing drought situation in dry periods dpi is also useful for identifying elevated drought potential in the wet season which otherwise could not be captured in other standardized indices the normalized drought potential index dpi accounts for the regional hydrological variability by removing the typical difference between water storage and precipitation anomaly and thus presents a basin wide holistic estimate of the prevailing drought conditions the high storage deficit i e large negative deficit value combined with the high negative precipitation anomaly indicates the high probability of the drought dpi is also unaffected by the short lasting high fluctuations in the precipitation e g torrential rain and rather presents the effect of the persistent precipitation trend on the regional scale since it represents the tendency of the basin for the likelihood of hydroclimatic extremes based on the preceding water storage conditions it can support the forecasting of droughts at a much accurate level when combined with the precipitation projections the grace fo derived dpi is highly reliable for the long term assessment of the water deficit situation in the basin rather than the short term analysis droughts with higher dpi are evident in the inter annual profiles of precipitation and twsa which enables dpi to assess the severe droughts more accurately than the mild droughts since the proposed dpi is capable of recording the regional event of hydroclimatic extremes along with the annual variability it will be valuable for the improved basin scale drought predictions a continuous deficit in the precipitation may lead to higher dpi and should be confirmed with the monthly tws deficits in the study region because dpi considers the water storage based on the precipitation for calculating the monthly drought potential amount also the longer the grace fo based twsa data is the better is the dpi s performance in representing the prevailing hydrological characteristics of the basin 3 7 institutional interventions for sustainable water utilities decreasing trends in various water storage components especially groundwater seem to be triggered during the drought years partly by the variable precipitation and partly by the integrated impact of less recharge and high water demand leading to the amplified pumping figs s7 and s12 further the increasing tendency of the basin to experience prolonged droughts and floods due to the highly variable precipitation may impose threats to the food production health and livelihood of the people and the economy as groundwater levels are going down there is a strong likelihood to shift the reliance on the deeper wells which may further affect several processes firstly digging deeper wells may not alleviate water scarcity due to the poor gw quality in deep aquifers secondly it might enhance the water availability gap between the various economic classes of society jasechko and perrone 2021 thirdly it may exaggerate the existing land subsidence issues in and around highly urbanized cities e g bangkok babel et al 2006 and may further extend to other developing areas therefore to ensure the equitable share and reliability of the groundwater based water supply a multifaceted strategy for efficient management inclusive governance and effective policymaking for groundwater sustainability is imperative in the basin amid a transition from a historical center of rice production to the current water scarce conditions the prevailing complex institutional environment of the chao phraya river basin with different agencies having different roles at various administrative levels and in multiple stages of water resources development storage and distribution needs to be understood because in this critical phase every small change in the hydrological situation can heavily impact the socio economic conditions of the basin https fdmt iwlearn org for example had there been ample time and accurate assessment of the flood in 2011 an early monsoon release of water albeit uncommon from the bhumibol and sirikit reservoirs would have enabled storing about one billion cubic meter floodwater in these reservoirs during the flooding event as pointed out by komori et al 2012 alarming deforestation rates due to urbanization and farmland exploitation have lowered the soil s water retaining capacity and therefore increases the risk of soil erosion flash floods and landslides https fdmt iwlearn org the resulting low infiltration percolation and subsequent pollution to near surface water resources might have intensified the overreliance on groundwater for irrigation ultimately leading to the decreasing terrestrial water storage trends in the basin to maintain sustainable water utilities against the observed weakening hydrological cycle in the region the promotion of institutional interventions to ensure sound hydrological cycles is of paramount importance in addition to the ongoing groundwater recharge projects http www dgr go th water conservation practices focused on the demand side such as switching from more water intense e g rice to less water intensive and commercial crops and or upgrading the irrigation systems to more efficient ones should be promoted to ensure the uninterrupted and efficient water supply in future the large declining trends of tws and its constituent components as revealed in the current assessment indicate an imbalance in withdrawals and replenishment rates in various water storage components and underscore the need to either revising the existing multilateral cooperation among various stakeholders or effective and efficient policymaking regulating the new settlements and water allocation strategies especially in the regions with existing complex water management despite the presence of a dense network of flood control and water storing measures e g dikes levees reservoirs etc the multiple drought and flood events experienced in cprb highlight the need for revising the approach for managing the hydroclimatic extremes while giving the associated risks of the ecosystem degradations a due consideration analyses of individual water storage components enhanced drought potential by dpi and drought propagation behavior by various standardized indices in this study are expected to provide a new perspective for revising the overlapping water management strategies among a plethora of governing agencies in the basin 4 conclusion driven from the high vulnerability of the chao phraya river basin to water related disasters i e floods and droughts we attempted to quantify the water storage dynamics by integrating the grace fo based terrestrial water storage global and local hydrological datasets and multiple drought indices major findings of the study are summarized as below 1 reasonably good performance of the proposed model training r 0 96 nse 0 90 validation r 0 94 nse 0 85 indicates its potential not only for filling the data gap between grace and grace fo records but also for filling the intermittent data gaps in grace fo occurring due to the battery management practices moreover the genetic algorithm when coupled with the ann model ann bp ga eliminates the need for the trial and error method prevalent to determine the hidden layers in the ann models 2 effects of all the drought and flood events in cprb are evident in the twsa series with high fluctuations during the major flood event of 2011 and drought events of 2015 and 2019 which is still continuing twsa has multiyear depletion and recovery events from 2002 to 2020 with surplus water storage until march 2014 this framework of quantifying various hydro climatic extremes using multisource data products can be adopted to various data scarce regions globally 3 groundwater storage is the dominant component 45 of declining tws trends followed by surface water storage 36 and soil moisture storage 19 these trends especially in gws provide a quantitative evaluation of groundwater resources in the region which otherwise due to the limited in situ data pumping gw table aquifer properties etc impedes the holistic assessment of the water beneath our feet results of the current study may provide an observational constraint and basis for employing early water management initiatives not only in the cprb but in other regions e g india where there is overreliance though often unreported due to lack of documentation or stringent measures among other reasons on groundwater resources 4 detection of the decreasing trend in groundwater storage which is probably more acute than the decrease change in precipitation through the application of grace and other auxiliary multisource products highlights the need for swift policy change to reduce the water demand e g encouraging less water intense crops decrease the dependence on groundwater and increase the implementation of the new groundwater recharge projects in the basin and provides a blueprint for similar studies in the data scarce basin to get insights of the commonly invisible groundwater 5 the lag time between various standardized indices helped to understand the drought propagation through various components of the system which will help in efficiently employing the early warning measures of the water management in the likelihood of water related extremes in the region 6 the highest deficit in the available water storage and the precipitation during the wet season as revealed by the drought potential index dpi indicate the early signs of the region s transition to a drought prone situation the crux of dpi is that it incorporates combined effects of the climate variability and human activities water management policymaking etc and can be applied to holistically quantify the potential of the development of the anthropogenic droughts in coupled human nature systems globally with implications for both short and long term water resources planning and management water governance and policymaking dpi can also be effectively utilized for identifying droughts during wet seasons employing the optimal adaptation measures and multilateral water management policymaking and efficient water allocation strategies in the data scarce river basins globally the cprb has been under a continuously increasing water stress since april 2014 as revealed by the water storage deficit analysis and the increasing trend in the proposed dpi the current framework when jointly used with precipitation and evapotranspiration forecasting and the adaptive reservoir operation rule curves kompor et al 2020 can help in developing the early warning systems for floods and droughts that will efficiently sustain the basin s socio economic activities since the grace fo represents the integrated water storage in a region when combined with the proposed mlp bp ga neural network and climate forecasting potential periods of hydro climatic extremes can be predicted with a lag time of several weeks to months cheng et al 2020 future satellite data of terrestrial water and continuously developing land surface models along with the ground based data will further enable us to assess the water storage dynamics and subsequent floods and droughts at a higher spatiotemporal resolution the separate assessment of anthropogenic impacts i e groundwater abstraction and reservoir management and climate variabilities on water storage dynamics in the basin will also be carried out in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
