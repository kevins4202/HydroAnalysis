1560,the groundwater vulnerability assessment has been identified as an important tool of groundwater pollution prevention in this study the drastic method was modified to estimate the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate the parameter system was optimized by replacing the original parameters of aquifer media soil media impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity with quantitative parameters of aquifer thickness nitrate attenuation intensity hydraulic resistance and groundwater velocity and adding pollutant input intensity to develop the dranthvp method in addition the rating scale of the drastic method was revised and the weight and influence degree of each parameter were determined using the projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc model the dranthvp method was applied to the plain area of western jilin province and the vulnerability index map of groundwater to nitrate pollution was established the dranthvp method improved the correlation coefficient between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration to 0 720 which was more than three times that of the original drastic method and the high variance of the anova f statistic indicated that there was less overlap between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes furthermore the dranthvp method produced a more uniform distribution of vulnerability classes in short the dranthvp method using the ppdc model was suitable to assess the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the study area hence the mapping of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate can provide a scientific and reasonable basis for the formulation of groundwater resource protection plan keywords groundwater vulnerability nitrate gis dranthvp method ppdc model china 1 introduction groundwater pollution is becoming a global problem threatening the safety of drinking water because of its the concealment of occurrence and the lag of discovery groundwater pollution is difficult to repair once the pollution is found therefore the prevention and control of groundwater pollution is indispensable for effectively alleviating the deterioration of groundwater quality elçi 2017 in arid and semiarid regions groundwater in porous aquifers has become the main source of water for local industry agriculture and residents because of its wide distribution and substantial water quantities jianmin et al 2015 however nitrate pollution in groundwater was aggravated by human cultivation and the overuse of fertilizers shrestha et al 2016 consequently this study focuses on combining a vulnerability method with factors affecting nitrate pollution to optimize apply and validate the vulnerability method groundwater vulnerability is classified into two aspects intrinsic vulnerability and specific vulnerability national research council 1993 the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers can be defined as the vulnerability that considers only the geogenic factors of hydrogeology without considering human activities and pollution sources vrba and zaporozec 1994 considering the properties of pollutants and their relationship the special vulnerability is used to define the vulnerability of groundwater to particular contaminants or group of contaminants aller et al 1987 at present the special vulnerability of groundwater is regarded more meaningful than the intrinsic vulnerability because nowadays several intrinsic vulnerability parameters such as soil medium the impact of the vadose zone and water conductivity have been changed due to increased human activities neshat et al 2014 in areas dominated by agriculture nitrate pollution caused by the overuse of fertilizers has become a major threat to the groundwater environment leone et al 2009 therefore nitrate in groundwater is often used as an indicator for groundwater vulnerability and pollution risk assessment ghahremanzadeh et al 2017 the methods of groundwater vulnerability assessment include overlay index method process mathematical simulation method statistical method and fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation method among which overlay index method is the main method gogu et al 2003 the drastic method proposed by the u s environmental agency usepa in 1987 is the most commonly used overlay index technique to evaluate intrinsic vulnerability aller et al 1987 this method combines geological and hydrogeological factors and selects seven representative evaluation indicators to accurately evaluate groundwater vulnerability from qualitative and quantitative aspects antonakos and lambrakis 2007 however the selected parameters ratings and weights of drastic method cannot accurately describe the differences of aquifer properties in different regions which makes the application of drastic method have some significant disadvantages neshat et al 2014 barzegar et al 2018 in view of the deficiency many scholars have modified the parameter system of drastic method al amoush et al 2010 noori et al 2018 based on specific environmental factors or sensitive attributes of human activities in order to overcome the subjectivity in the operation of the method some scholars have used sensitivity analysis and nitrate concentration test to modify index weights kazakis and voudouris 2015 barzegar et al 2019 and rating scale huan et al 2012 neshat et al 2014 of the method respectively but they may have neglected the discretization of the evaluation results and so far there is no better solution to the quantitative standard of qualitative parameters the size of the parameter weight reflects its importance to groundwater vulnerability it is important to determine the weight of parameter objectively reasonably and correctly for the results of vulnerability assessment at present there are two main methods to determine the weight subjective weighting method and objective weighting method antonakos and lambrakis 2007 the subjective weighting method is based on the subjective judgment of expert experience and the result is seriously interfered by human factors sahoo et al 2016 the objective weighting method uses the mathematical statistics method to determine the weight by calculating the correlation between the indicators but its accuracy depends on the accuracy of the statistical data martínez bastida et al 2010 in recent years the projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc model has been widely used in environmental assessment because of its advantages in dealing with multi factor problems and overcoming the subjectivity of traditional methods wei et al 2014 the ppdc model as a dynamic cluster analysis model based on projection pursuit analyzes the characteristics of the high dimensional data by projecting the high dimensional data into the low dimensional space and finding the optimal projection direction that can reflect the data characteristics friedman and tukey 1974 the size of each sub vector of the optimal projection direction reflects the sensitivity of the evaluation results to the individual index changes of each evaluation indicator jia et al 2018 in addition the accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding is used to optimize the ppdc model globally and the optimal projection direction obtained makes the indexes with large difference in grade division evaluation get higher weight wang and ni 2008 therefore the index weight determined using the ppdc model is more objective and scientific although this method has been widely used in the field of water ecology and environmental science such as water quality assessment zhao et al 2012 environmental monitoring zhang 2012 disaster assessment zhao et al 2014 and water resources assessment wang and ni 2008 it has not been applied in the study of groundwater vulnerability assessment the combination of the vulnerability index method with the ppdc model would reduce the interference of human factors furthermore the modification to the vulnerability method of porous aquifers would increase the reliability of specific groundwater vulnerability prediction for nitrate and thus help produce a scientific and reasonable groundwater resources protection plan therefore the objective of this study was to develop an integrated method which can accurately evaluate the groundwater vulnerability to nitrate by optimizing and validating the drastic method based on the specific characteristics of porous aquifers and nitrate concentrations the process of optimization was based on the optimization of the parameter system with quantitative parameters and the rating scale of each parameter was revised through statistical method finally the parameter weights were determined by ppdc model 2 study area the study area is located in the plain area of western jilin province in particular it is situated at the latitude between 43 58 and 46 18 and the longitude between 122 01 and 125 57 bo et al 2003 the terrain of the area is high in the east south and west with a relatively low terrain at the center and in the north the topography is dustpan shaped with an elevation ranging from 150 m to 200 m this area belongs to the north temperate continental monsoon climate with evident changes in the four seasons the climate changes from semihumid to semiarid in areas from east to west the annual average temperature is 4 9 c to 5 5 c and the temperature difference is considerable during the year the average annual precipitation is 399 7 mm to 576 7 mm and the precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september which accounts for 60 80 of the annual precipitation the average annual evaporation is 1638 9 mm to 1833 4 mm and most of the rivers in the study area belong to the songhua river system baicheng city has one municipal district taobei district two counties zhenlai county and tongyu county and two county level cities taonan city and da an city songyuan city has one municipal district ningjiang district one county level city fuyu city and three counties qian an county changling county and qianguo county the total area of the two cities is 47 074 5 km2 which occupies 25 4 of the area of jilin province and the area of the plain area is 41 518 km2 which is the study area of this paper fig 1 the majority of the study area belongs to the songnen basin which is a huge aquifer system with multiple buried aquifers the aquifer system in the area can be divided into phreatic and confined aquifer systems according to hydraulic characteristics yang et al 2005 the phreatic aquifer system includes the quaternary holocene porous aquifers with gravel and sand gravel and the quaternary upper pleistocene porous aquifers with sand and loess clay sand fig 1 among them in the quaternary holocene porous aquifers the thickness of aquifer is from 10 m to 20 m the water yield in single well varies from 500 m3 d to 1000 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is from 30 m d to 100 m d in addition in the quaternary upper pleistocene porous aquifers the thickness of aquifer is from 10 m to 50 m the water yield in single well varies from 500 m3 d to 2000 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is from 10 m d to 30 m d the confined aquifer system consists of the quaternary lower pleistocene semi pressurized porous aquifers with sand and gravel and the tertiary confined porous aquifers with sandstone and glutenite the porous aquifers that developed in the quaternary and tertiary sediments are distributed throughout the plain area and uses intergranular pores as storage space with the continuous increase of population the rapid development of industry and agriculture and the continuous expansion of urban scale the demand for water resources in many regions of western jilin province has been increasing most of which is met by porous aquifers jianmin et al 2015 however the overuse of fertilizers in farming and the low utilization rate of fertilizers have increased the pollution of groundwater by nitrate in the study area which poses a threat the human and livestock as well as the environment mahvi 2005 enzenhoefer et al 2015 therefore the research on groundwater vulnerability to nitrate by selecting the porous aquifers in the phreatic aquifer systems as the target is essential to maintain the suitability of urban water supply and agricultural water use and achieve the sustainability of groundwater resources 3 methodology and data 3 1 method for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate the drastic method aller et al 1987 is based on the following seven hydrogeological parameters depth to water table d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c each of these hydrogeologic factors is assigned a rating of 1 to 10 and has a weight of 1 to 5 based on their importance to groundwater vulnerability the general formula of the drastic index is as follows 1 di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t rw i r i w c r c w where d r a s t i c were defined earlier r is the rating for the study area and w is the weight of each factor the higher the di value is the greater the groundwater vulnerability is and the higher the possibility of groundwater contamination is foster 1987 before the vulnerability index is calculated in this study the weight of each parameter needs to be normalized in order to compare the evaluation results the specific vulnerability can be obtained by overlaying the intrinsic vulnerability map based on the drastic method with the layer representing actual sources of pollution babiker et al 2005 sinan and razack 2009 therefore combining the intrinsic vulnerability map of the aquifer and the map of land uses in the plain area of western jilin province the special vulnerability map of this aquifer drasticl method was produced the weights and normalized weights for each parameter of the drastic and drasticl method were shown in table 1 aller et al 1987 3 2 projection pursuit dynamic clustering projection pursuit dynamic clustering as a statistical analysis for high dimensional data based on projection hall 1989 ni et al 2006 provides a new method to determine the weight of parameters in groundwater vulnerability assessment by projecting parameters data into one dimensional space and analyzing their characteristics zhao et al 2014 firstly based on the relationship between the hydrogeological parameters and the rating scale of each parameter in vulnerability assessment the vulnerability projection data required for the ppdc model was constructed by randomly generating vulnerability index samples then the high dimensional vulnerability data was projected into one dimensional space by using projection dimensionality reduction technology finally the dynamic clustering method was used to cluster and analyze the projected characteristic value in one dimensional space to determine parameter weights and the influence degree of each parameter on the vulnerability assessment results therefore if the initial value of the jth factor of the ith sample is x ij 0 i 1 n j 1 m n is the total number of samples m is the number of vulnerability assessment parameters the steps of developing the ppdc model are described as follows jia et al 2018 3 2 1 data standardization in order to eliminate the effect of different dimension and value range the factor data will be standardized to eliminate the dimensional effect the standardization equation wang and ni 2008 is 2 x ij x ij 0 x jmin 0 x jmax 0 x jmin 0 where x jmax 0 and x jmin 0 are the maximum and the minimum of the jth factor respectively 3 2 2 linear projection the purpose of linear projection is to find the hidden structure by projecting high dimensional data into one dimensional linear space cui 1997 if a a 1 a 2 a j a m t is an m dimensional unit vector and the one dimensional projected characteristic value of x ij is z i linear projection can be described as 3 z i j 1 m a j x ij where a is projection axis vector and it is also called projection direction vector 3 2 3 projection index in this study projection index is constructed based on the dynamic cluster principle har even and brailovsky 1995 first define s z i z k k 1 n as the absolute value of distance between the projected characteristic value z i and z k namely s z i z k z i z k let ω z 1 z 2 z n and define 4 ss a z i z k ω s z i z k then we assume that the all samples are classified as n 2 n n clusters θ h h 1 2 n is the data space containing all the projected characteristic value of cluster h and thus 5 θ h z i d a h z i d a t z i t 1 2 n t h where d a h z i z i a h and d a t z i z i a t a h and a t is the initial cluster core of both cluster hth and cluster tth respectively in practice we use the average projected characteristic value of clusters as new cluster core to iterate until the criterion is met wang and ni 2008 we also define 6 dd a h 1 n d h a where d h a z i z k θ h s z i z k finally the new projection index qq a in the ppdc model is as follow 7 qq a ss a dd a the projection index qq a measures the degree to which the data points in the projection are both concentrated locally ss a large while at the same time expanded globally dd a small 3 2 4 model and optimization according to the above analysis the ppdc model can be designed as the following nonlinear optimization problems 8 max qq a a 1 in this study the accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding was programmed and processed in matlab 7 01 wang et al 2006 jia et al 2018 and it was applied to optimize and calculate the ppdc model then the corresponding sub vector of the optimal projection direction obtained by calculation is the weight of parameter in groundwater vulnerability assessment 3 3 optimization of drastic method for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate the methodology developed in this study for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate attempted to retain the basic structure of drastic method and optimize it by fully considering the causes of groundwater nitrate pollution and eliminating the subjectivity of the weight rating and classification of the parameters kazakis and voudouris 2015 the modified contents include 1 optimization of the parameter system by replacing the qualitative with quantitative parameters and adding parameters to develop the dranthvp method 2 revision of the rating scale of each parameter and 3 determination of parameter weights using ppdc model the flow chart of the processes used to modify the drastic method for estimating groundwater vulnerability is shown in fig 2 3 3 1 optimization of the parameter system to groundwater vulnerability the parameter modifications were as follows 3 3 1 1 replacement of the aquifer media a with the aquifer thickness a the aquifer media a of the drastic method is a qualitative parameter prasad et al 2011 however there are few types of porous aquifers in the study area mainly sand and gravel in the assessment of groundwater specific vulnerability the dilution effect of groundwater on pollutants cannot be ignored the aquifer thickness not only reflects the size of groundwater storage space but also is a critical parameter to determine the dilution ability of groundwater to nitrate zhong 2005 huan et al 2012 in this study the aquifer thickness was selected instead of the aquifer media 3 3 1 2 replacement of the soil media s with the nitrate attenuation intensity n the soil media strongly affects the ability of pollutants to transport vertically to the vadose zone however the discretization of the soil media in the study area is small during biological denitrification anoxic environment is a necessary condition for the survival of denitrifying bacteria and soil organic matter is the nutrient and energy source for their reproduction and metabolism bending and turner 2009 accordingly soil oxygen content and organic matter content jointly control the denitrification intensity of microorganism which directly determines the total amount of no3 that can be efficiently converted and dissipated leifeld and kögel knabner 2005 in the same environment poor aeration and high content of soil organic matter will promote the growth and reproduction of denitrifying bacteria and affect the denitrification process resulting in the reduction of nitrate entering groundwater yun et al 2006 in addition soil moisture content and porosity are important indicators of soil aeration grundmann et al 1995 therefore according to the difference of soil moisture content porosity and organic matter content in the reclassified soil media each type of soil was assigned different relative values of nitrate attenuation intensity which replaced the soil media 3 3 1 3 using the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone h to represent the impact of the vadose zone i the vadose zone is the medium between the soil and aquifer and is also a necessary way for pollutants to enter the aquifer neshat et al 2015 however the lithology of the vadose zone is mainly dominated by subsandy soil in the porous aquifers of the study area so the discretization of the characteristics of the vadose zone in the drastic method is not obvious the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone can be used to measure the relative transit time of pollutants from the surface through the vadose zone to the groundwater and the hydraulic resistance can be described by the ratio of the thickness of the vadose zone to their vertical hydraulic conductivity kazakis and voudouris 2015 accordingly the impact of the vadose zone was replaced by hydraulic resistance of quantitative parameter 3 3 1 4 replacement of the hydraulic conductivity c with the groundwater velocity v previous studies have shown a negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and nitrate panagopoulos et al 2006 busico et al 2017 and the same results have been shown in this study r 0 119 groundwater exploitation is one of the indicators of human activities affecting the vulnerability of groundwater and groundwater level differences hydraulic gradient caused by groundwater exploitation is an important factor determining groundwater velocity labaky et al 2010 the groundwater velocity can describe the range of groundwater nitrate pollution under the process of dispersion and advection huan et al 2012 meanwhile the groundwater velocity calculated by combining hydraulic gradient with hydraulic conductivity according to darcy s law sinan and razack 2009 was positively correlated with nitrate concentration therefore the hydraulic conductivity was replaced by groundwater velocity in the groundwater vulnerability assessment to nitrate 3 3 1 5 adding land use types and characterizing them with the pollutant input intensity p land use types are not included in the original drastic method but the amount of pollutant loads produced varies across land use types tasdighi et al 2017 the land use type is the key factor affecting the transport and transformation of nitrate in the vadose zone li et al 2012 therefore the land use type was added as a parameter of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution however the land use type is a qualitative parameter so each type of land use was assigned different relative values of pollutant input intensity according to the difference of pollution source type in land use types in this study gu et al 2013 thus the pollutant input intensity of quantitative parameter was used to characterize land use types the parameter system of the new method to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate comprised depth to groundwater d net recharge r aquifer thickness a nitrate attenuation intensity n topography t hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone h groundwater velocity v and pollutant input intensity p therefore the new method was abbreviated for dranthvp method 3 3 2 revision of the rating scale of each parameter the key to improving the accuracy of groundwater vulnerability assessment results is to improve the rationality of the rating scale assaf and saadeh 2009 in the dranthvp method each parameter was divided into 10 classes with a rating score from 1 to 10 by using simple statistical method panagopoulos et al 2006 in addition considering the requirement of ppdc model for initial data an upper limit value was added for the maximum range of each parameter according to the range of each parameter and the upper limit of the actual range of each parameter should not exceed this upper limit value 3 3 3 determination of the parameter weights using ppdc model reducing the interference of human factors and improving the objectivity of index weights are of great significance to the results of groundwater vulnerability assessment wu et al 2014 the parameter weights of the original drastic method are determined by subjective weighting method so the result is seriously interfered by human factors sahoo et al 2016 moreover the same hydrogeological parameter has different impacts on groundwater vulnerability in various regions neshat et al 2015 therefore the parameter weights of the drastic method modified must be reassigned ppdc model not only has strong objectivity but also can maintain the structural characteristics of high dimensional data ni et al 2006 consequently ppdc model was used for the first time to determine the weight of each parameter in the vulnerability assessment method in this study and the influence degree of each parameter on the assessment results can be determined based on the optimal projection direction in this study 30 values were randomly generated within the range of each rating class of the 8 parameters since the rating scale of the dranthvp method was divided into 10 classes a total of 300 standard samples were obtained then the optimal projection direction was calculated on the basis of the calculation procedure of the ppdc model 3 4 data sampling and analysis human cultivation and the overuse of fertilizers have resulted in a large amount of nitrogen entering the soil and water which has increased the pollution of nitrate to groundwater in the plain area of western jilin province jianmin et al 2015 ghahremanzadeh et al 2017 mohammad et al 2018 therefore nitrate was taken as the typical pollutant in this study in the wet period from june to september crops are growing and fertilization activities are frequent resulting in more serious nitrate pollution in groundwater than in other periods kumazawa 2002 consequently a total of 120 groundwater samples were monitored and collected by stratified sampling method during the wet period of the 2014 hydrological year fig 1 and the sampling depth was within 10 50 m of porous phreatic aquifers plastic bottles 500 ml were used for storing and transporting the samples the samples were then analyzed for no3 using the thermo scientific evolution 201 uv visible spectrophotometer all of the data that include parameters in the groundwater vulnerability assessment to nitrate were obtained from different sources a summary of data types sources and output layers is shown in table 2 groundwater level measurements were performed in 271 observation wells during the wet and dry periods of the 2013 2015 hydrological years the groundwater depth map was generated from the mean value of the 6 periods average annual rainfall at 11 rainfall stations from 1985 to 2015 was prepared to estimate the recharge the aquifer media aquifer thickness and the impact of the vadose zone were obtained from geologic section formations using 106 drilling profiles at depths of approximately 120 m the soil media map and land use map were downloaded from the website of the chinese academy of sciences liu et al 2018 and the data of the pollutant input intensity was derived from the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure gu et al 2013 topographical map was based on dem digital elevation data with 30 m resolution in the study area the soil moisture content porosity and organic matter content were determined by physical and chemical analysis of 185 soil samples the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer can be estimated by pumping test the hydraulic resistance can be described by the ratio of the thickness of the vadose zone to their vertical hydraulic conductivity kazakis and voudouris 2015 based on the hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity the groundwater velocity was estimated using the groundwater darcy s velocity model package of arcgis 9 3 software sinan and razack 2009 here the grading methods of equal interval natural breaks quantile and geometrical intervals have been used to define the class ranges of each parameter in vulnerability assessment huan et al 2012 in addition the groundwater vulnerability index to nitrate was graded by geometrical interval method kazakis and voudouris 2015 3 5 validation of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate in this study the correlation between groundwater vulnerability index and nitrate concentration al amoush et al 2010 and analysis of variance of f statistic were adopted to verify the reliability and accuracy of the applied method bryman and cramer 1997 pearson s r correlation factor was used to validate the vulnerability index and rating of parameter fink 1995 kazakis and voudouris 2015 however the statistical significance of the shapiro wilk s test of the nitrate data shows that the available data does not satisfy the assumption of pearson s r correlation factor that the nitrate concentration is a normal distribution ahlgren et al 2014 therefore the nitrate concentration data were logarithmically transformed before correlation analysis panagopoulos et al 2006 analysis of the variance anova f statistic was used for the significance test of the mean difference between samples bryman and cramer 1997 in this study the anova f statistic was used to characterize the overlap degree between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes the larger the anova f statistic the less overlap between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes and the higher the accuracy of the evaluation results lake et al 2003 the anova f statistic can be calculated by eq 9 9 f mst mse sst k 1 sse n k where mst and mse are respectively the mean square and mean square for error sst and sse are respectively the sum of squares for treatment and the sum of squares for error k 1 and n k are respectively the freedom degree for treatment and freedom degree for error 4 results and discussion 4 1 original groundwater vulnerability assessment to nitrate on the arcgis platform the score vector map of each parameter fig 3a g in the drastic method was respectively extracted and analyzed the rating ranks of parameters were shown in table 3 aller et al 1987 the intrinsic vulnerability index of porous aquifers can be calculated by weighted sum in gis environment thus the assessment results of the intrinsic vulnerability and the correlation with nitrate concentrations in the study area were illustrated in fig 4 the vulnerability index was in the range from 0 12 to 8 75 and was classified into five classes of vulnerability very low low medium high and very high the results indicate that the correlation between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration is very low r 0 204 and 88 68 of the total study area exhibits the low or medium classes of vulnerability fig 8 the specific vulnerability index to nitrate drasticl method was produced by spatial superposition of the drastic index and the score vector map of land uses fig 3h antonakos and lambrakis 2007 the land use types and their assigned rating values were shown in table 1 and the normalized weight of land uses was set to 0 22 which was the same as the depth of groundwater and impact of the vadose zone sinan and razack 2009 kazakis and voudouris 2015 the results were presented in fig 5 although the discretization of vulnerability classes in the study area has been significantly improved fig 8 the correlation between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration is still low r 0 259 these observations led to the conclusion that neither the original drastic method nor the drasticl method with added land use can reflect the actual groundwater vulnerability to nitrate the use of qualitative parameters and the ignorance of the objective characteristics of the actual aquifer are responsible for the low correlation between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration therefore optimization of parameters revision of the rating and objective determination of parameter weights are considered as necessary conditions to increase the reliability of groundwater vulnerability assessment to nitrate 4 2 application and validation of dranthvp method for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate the dranthvp method based on the drastic method modified significantly improves the reliability and representativeness of the vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate revised ranges and ratings of the dranthvp method parameters were listed in table 4 according to the revised rating scale the thematic maps of the eight parameters fig 6 in the dranthvp method were re extracted through the arcgis platform it can be seen from fig 6 that the discretization of each parameter was significantly improved and the correlation between parameters and nitrate concentration was also significantly increased table 5 based on the revised rating scale the eight parameter weights of the dranthvp method were determined according to the calculation procedure of the ppdc model in this study the accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding was applied to optimize the ppdc model in which m 8 n 300 and n 10 and was programmed in matlab 7 01 and calculated by computer after 18 iterations the optimal projection direction was obtained a 0 331 0 290 0 305 0 443 0 227 0 269 0 353 0 517 and the parameter weights of the dranthvp method was determined table 5 after modifications of parameters ratings and weights eq 10 can be converted as follows 10 dranthvp index 0 121 d 0 106 r 0 112 a 0 162 n 0 083 t 0 098 h 0 129 v 0 189 p where d r a n t h v p were defined earlier in addition according to the optimal projection direction the influence degree of each parameter on groundwater vulnerability assessment results can be further determined and their order from large to small is as follows p n v d a r h and t therefore the pollutant input intensity is the most influential parameter for groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the plain area of western jilin province followed by the nitrate attenuation intensity the dranthvp method was applied to assess the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the plain area of western jilin province the assessment results of the groundwater vulnerability and the correlation with nitrate concentrations in the study area were illustrated in fig 7 the results show that the application of the dranthvp method significantly increases the correlation coefficient between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration r 0 720 in addition the groundwater vulnerability using the dranthvp method still maintains a high degree of discretization of the vulnerability classes in porous aquifers and the vulnerability index ranged from 1 08 to 9 04 and was classified into five classes as shown in fig 7 the areas with the highest vulnerability are located in the eastern part of the fuyu city the baicheng city in the northwestern part and the qian an county in the south central of the study area these areas cover part of the built up areas with higher population density or the agricultural areas with poor management which are related to high levels of pollutant emissions pollutant emissions mainly come from a variety of sources with high nitrogen content such as domestic sewage industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation and fertilization the hydrogeological characteristics of these areas do not prevent the nitrogen pollutants produced from entering aquifers so the groundwater in aquifers is more vulnerable to nitrate pollution in addition the western area of tongyu county and the nen river bank area in the northeast of the study area have lower contamination vulnerabilities the land use types in these areas are mainly wetlands woodlands and grasslands and nitrogen pollutant input intensity are low so the possibility of nitrate pollution in groundwater was reduced the areas with the medium vulnerability accounted for about a quarter of the total study area and are widely distributed fig 8 illustrates that 38 02 of the plain area of western jilin province exhibits very low or low classes of vulnerability furthermore 21 67 of the study area exhibits high class of vulnerability and 16 88 of the study area exhibits very high class of vulnerability the correlation value indicates the applicability and reliability of the methods applied in the study area as shown in table 6 compared with the original drastic method r 0 204 the correlation coefficient of the dranthvp method r 0 720 was significantly increased by more than three times in addition when the dranthvp method was applied the resulting variance of the anova f statistic test was greater than the original drastic and drasticl methods indicating that there was less overlap between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes by comparing the class areas of the drastic drasticl and dranthvp methods fig 8 the original drastic indices underestimate the vulnerability of the aquifer to nitrate since only 0 01 of the study area exhibits very low class of vulnerability at the same time the drasticl indices also underestimate the vulnerability of the aquifer because up to 48 77 of the study area exhibits very low or low classes of vulnerability however the dranthvp method produced a more uniform distribution of vulnerability classes these results indicate that the optimized parameters and the weights determined using the ppdc model in the dranthvp method is scientific and reliable and the dranthvp method based on the drastic method modified can more accurately evaluate the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the plain area of western jilin province in this study only one sampling event during the wet period was adopted however the groundwater vulnerability to nitrate in porous aquifers still needs more continuous work under complex climate change and human activities for example groundwater samples from different periods will be collected and tested to obtain more scientific and reliable results of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate which can overcome the limitations of this study 5 conclusions it is important to evaluate the potential groundwater contamination in arid and semiarid areas where groundwater is the main source of water the overuse of fertilizers in farming has increased nitrate pollution in groundwater in the study area considering that the original drastic and drasticl methods cannot reflect the actual groundwater vulnerability to nitrate this study developed the dranthvp method to assess the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the plain area of western jilin province in this study the drastic method was first optimized by replacing the original parameters aquifer media soil media impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity with quantitative parameters aquifer thickness nitrate attenuation intensity hydraulic resistance and groundwater velocity and adding pollutant input intensity so the dranthvp method was developed then the rating scale of parameters was revised and the ppdc model was used for the first time to determine parameter weights of the dranthvp method and the influence degree of each parameter on the assessment results the results indicate that the pollutant input intensity is the most influential parameters in the plain area

1560,the groundwater vulnerability assessment has been identified as an important tool of groundwater pollution prevention in this study the drastic method was modified to estimate the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate the parameter system was optimized by replacing the original parameters of aquifer media soil media impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity with quantitative parameters of aquifer thickness nitrate attenuation intensity hydraulic resistance and groundwater velocity and adding pollutant input intensity to develop the dranthvp method in addition the rating scale of the drastic method was revised and the weight and influence degree of each parameter were determined using the projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc model the dranthvp method was applied to the plain area of western jilin province and the vulnerability index map of groundwater to nitrate pollution was established the dranthvp method improved the correlation coefficient between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration to 0 720 which was more than three times that of the original drastic method and the high variance of the anova f statistic indicated that there was less overlap between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes furthermore the dranthvp method produced a more uniform distribution of vulnerability classes in short the dranthvp method using the ppdc model was suitable to assess the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the study area hence the mapping of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate can provide a scientific and reasonable basis for the formulation of groundwater resource protection plan keywords groundwater vulnerability nitrate gis dranthvp method ppdc model china 1 introduction groundwater pollution is becoming a global problem threatening the safety of drinking water because of its the concealment of occurrence and the lag of discovery groundwater pollution is difficult to repair once the pollution is found therefore the prevention and control of groundwater pollution is indispensable for effectively alleviating the deterioration of groundwater quality elçi 2017 in arid and semiarid regions groundwater in porous aquifers has become the main source of water for local industry agriculture and residents because of its wide distribution and substantial water quantities jianmin et al 2015 however nitrate pollution in groundwater was aggravated by human cultivation and the overuse of fertilizers shrestha et al 2016 consequently this study focuses on combining a vulnerability method with factors affecting nitrate pollution to optimize apply and validate the vulnerability method groundwater vulnerability is classified into two aspects intrinsic vulnerability and specific vulnerability national research council 1993 the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers can be defined as the vulnerability that considers only the geogenic factors of hydrogeology without considering human activities and pollution sources vrba and zaporozec 1994 considering the properties of pollutants and their relationship the special vulnerability is used to define the vulnerability of groundwater to particular contaminants or group of contaminants aller et al 1987 at present the special vulnerability of groundwater is regarded more meaningful than the intrinsic vulnerability because nowadays several intrinsic vulnerability parameters such as soil medium the impact of the vadose zone and water conductivity have been changed due to increased human activities neshat et al 2014 in areas dominated by agriculture nitrate pollution caused by the overuse of fertilizers has become a major threat to the groundwater environment leone et al 2009 therefore nitrate in groundwater is often used as an indicator for groundwater vulnerability and pollution risk assessment ghahremanzadeh et al 2017 the methods of groundwater vulnerability assessment include overlay index method process mathematical simulation method statistical method and fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation method among which overlay index method is the main method gogu et al 2003 the drastic method proposed by the u s environmental agency usepa in 1987 is the most commonly used overlay index technique to evaluate intrinsic vulnerability aller et al 1987 this method combines geological and hydrogeological factors and selects seven representative evaluation indicators to accurately evaluate groundwater vulnerability from qualitative and quantitative aspects antonakos and lambrakis 2007 however the selected parameters ratings and weights of drastic method cannot accurately describe the differences of aquifer properties in different regions which makes the application of drastic method have some significant disadvantages neshat et al 2014 barzegar et al 2018 in view of the deficiency many scholars have modified the parameter system of drastic method al amoush et al 2010 noori et al 2018 based on specific environmental factors or sensitive attributes of human activities in order to overcome the subjectivity in the operation of the method some scholars have used sensitivity analysis and nitrate concentration test to modify index weights kazakis and voudouris 2015 barzegar et al 2019 and rating scale huan et al 2012 neshat et al 2014 of the method respectively but they may have neglected the discretization of the evaluation results and so far there is no better solution to the quantitative standard of qualitative parameters the size of the parameter weight reflects its importance to groundwater vulnerability it is important to determine the weight of parameter objectively reasonably and correctly for the results of vulnerability assessment at present there are two main methods to determine the weight subjective weighting method and objective weighting method antonakos and lambrakis 2007 the subjective weighting method is based on the subjective judgment of expert experience and the result is seriously interfered by human factors sahoo et al 2016 the objective weighting method uses the mathematical statistics method to determine the weight by calculating the correlation between the indicators but its accuracy depends on the accuracy of the statistical data martínez bastida et al 2010 in recent years the projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc model has been widely used in environmental assessment because of its advantages in dealing with multi factor problems and overcoming the subjectivity of traditional methods wei et al 2014 the ppdc model as a dynamic cluster analysis model based on projection pursuit analyzes the characteristics of the high dimensional data by projecting the high dimensional data into the low dimensional space and finding the optimal projection direction that can reflect the data characteristics friedman and tukey 1974 the size of each sub vector of the optimal projection direction reflects the sensitivity of the evaluation results to the individual index changes of each evaluation indicator jia et al 2018 in addition the accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding is used to optimize the ppdc model globally and the optimal projection direction obtained makes the indexes with large difference in grade division evaluation get higher weight wang and ni 2008 therefore the index weight determined using the ppdc model is more objective and scientific although this method has been widely used in the field of water ecology and environmental science such as water quality assessment zhao et al 2012 environmental monitoring zhang 2012 disaster assessment zhao et al 2014 and water resources assessment wang and ni 2008 it has not been applied in the study of groundwater vulnerability assessment the combination of the vulnerability index method with the ppdc model would reduce the interference of human factors furthermore the modification to the vulnerability method of porous aquifers would increase the reliability of specific groundwater vulnerability prediction for nitrate and thus help produce a scientific and reasonable groundwater resources protection plan therefore the objective of this study was to develop an integrated method which can accurately evaluate the groundwater vulnerability to nitrate by optimizing and validating the drastic method based on the specific characteristics of porous aquifers and nitrate concentrations the process of optimization was based on the optimization of the parameter system with quantitative parameters and the rating scale of each parameter was revised through statistical method finally the parameter weights were determined by ppdc model 2 study area the study area is located in the plain area of western jilin province in particular it is situated at the latitude between 43 58 and 46 18 and the longitude between 122 01 and 125 57 bo et al 2003 the terrain of the area is high in the east south and west with a relatively low terrain at the center and in the north the topography is dustpan shaped with an elevation ranging from 150 m to 200 m this area belongs to the north temperate continental monsoon climate with evident changes in the four seasons the climate changes from semihumid to semiarid in areas from east to west the annual average temperature is 4 9 c to 5 5 c and the temperature difference is considerable during the year the average annual precipitation is 399 7 mm to 576 7 mm and the precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september which accounts for 60 80 of the annual precipitation the average annual evaporation is 1638 9 mm to 1833 4 mm and most of the rivers in the study area belong to the songhua river system baicheng city has one municipal district taobei district two counties zhenlai county and tongyu county and two county level cities taonan city and da an city songyuan city has one municipal district ningjiang district one county level city fuyu city and three counties qian an county changling county and qianguo county the total area of the two cities is 47 074 5 km2 which occupies 25 4 of the area of jilin province and the area of the plain area is 41 518 km2 which is the study area of this paper fig 1 the majority of the study area belongs to the songnen basin which is a huge aquifer system with multiple buried aquifers the aquifer system in the area can be divided into phreatic and confined aquifer systems according to hydraulic characteristics yang et al 2005 the phreatic aquifer system includes the quaternary holocene porous aquifers with gravel and sand gravel and the quaternary upper pleistocene porous aquifers with sand and loess clay sand fig 1 among them in the quaternary holocene porous aquifers the thickness of aquifer is from 10 m to 20 m the water yield in single well varies from 500 m3 d to 1000 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is from 30 m d to 100 m d in addition in the quaternary upper pleistocene porous aquifers the thickness of aquifer is from 10 m to 50 m the water yield in single well varies from 500 m3 d to 2000 m3 d and the hydraulic conductivity is from 10 m d to 30 m d the confined aquifer system consists of the quaternary lower pleistocene semi pressurized porous aquifers with sand and gravel and the tertiary confined porous aquifers with sandstone and glutenite the porous aquifers that developed in the quaternary and tertiary sediments are distributed throughout the plain area and uses intergranular pores as storage space with the continuous increase of population the rapid development of industry and agriculture and the continuous expansion of urban scale the demand for water resources in many regions of western jilin province has been increasing most of which is met by porous aquifers jianmin et al 2015 however the overuse of fertilizers in farming and the low utilization rate of fertilizers have increased the pollution of groundwater by nitrate in the study area which poses a threat the human and livestock as well as the environment mahvi 2005 enzenhoefer et al 2015 therefore the research on groundwater vulnerability to nitrate by selecting the porous aquifers in the phreatic aquifer systems as the target is essential to maintain the suitability of urban water supply and agricultural water use and achieve the sustainability of groundwater resources 3 methodology and data 3 1 method for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate the drastic method aller et al 1987 is based on the following seven hydrogeological parameters depth to water table d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of the vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c each of these hydrogeologic factors is assigned a rating of 1 to 10 and has a weight of 1 to 5 based on their importance to groundwater vulnerability the general formula of the drastic index is as follows 1 di d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t rw i r i w c r c w where d r a s t i c were defined earlier r is the rating for the study area and w is the weight of each factor the higher the di value is the greater the groundwater vulnerability is and the higher the possibility of groundwater contamination is foster 1987 before the vulnerability index is calculated in this study the weight of each parameter needs to be normalized in order to compare the evaluation results the specific vulnerability can be obtained by overlaying the intrinsic vulnerability map based on the drastic method with the layer representing actual sources of pollution babiker et al 2005 sinan and razack 2009 therefore combining the intrinsic vulnerability map of the aquifer and the map of land uses in the plain area of western jilin province the special vulnerability map of this aquifer drasticl method was produced the weights and normalized weights for each parameter of the drastic and drasticl method were shown in table 1 aller et al 1987 3 2 projection pursuit dynamic clustering projection pursuit dynamic clustering as a statistical analysis for high dimensional data based on projection hall 1989 ni et al 2006 provides a new method to determine the weight of parameters in groundwater vulnerability assessment by projecting parameters data into one dimensional space and analyzing their characteristics zhao et al 2014 firstly based on the relationship between the hydrogeological parameters and the rating scale of each parameter in vulnerability assessment the vulnerability projection data required for the ppdc model was constructed by randomly generating vulnerability index samples then the high dimensional vulnerability data was projected into one dimensional space by using projection dimensionality reduction technology finally the dynamic clustering method was used to cluster and analyze the projected characteristic value in one dimensional space to determine parameter weights and the influence degree of each parameter on the vulnerability assessment results therefore if the initial value of the jth factor of the ith sample is x ij 0 i 1 n j 1 m n is the total number of samples m is the number of vulnerability assessment parameters the steps of developing the ppdc model are described as follows jia et al 2018 3 2 1 data standardization in order to eliminate the effect of different dimension and value range the factor data will be standardized to eliminate the dimensional effect the standardization equation wang and ni 2008 is 2 x ij x ij 0 x jmin 0 x jmax 0 x jmin 0 where x jmax 0 and x jmin 0 are the maximum and the minimum of the jth factor respectively 3 2 2 linear projection the purpose of linear projection is to find the hidden structure by projecting high dimensional data into one dimensional linear space cui 1997 if a a 1 a 2 a j a m t is an m dimensional unit vector and the one dimensional projected characteristic value of x ij is z i linear projection can be described as 3 z i j 1 m a j x ij where a is projection axis vector and it is also called projection direction vector 3 2 3 projection index in this study projection index is constructed based on the dynamic cluster principle har even and brailovsky 1995 first define s z i z k k 1 n as the absolute value of distance between the projected characteristic value z i and z k namely s z i z k z i z k let ω z 1 z 2 z n and define 4 ss a z i z k ω s z i z k then we assume that the all samples are classified as n 2 n n clusters θ h h 1 2 n is the data space containing all the projected characteristic value of cluster h and thus 5 θ h z i d a h z i d a t z i t 1 2 n t h where d a h z i z i a h and d a t z i z i a t a h and a t is the initial cluster core of both cluster hth and cluster tth respectively in practice we use the average projected characteristic value of clusters as new cluster core to iterate until the criterion is met wang and ni 2008 we also define 6 dd a h 1 n d h a where d h a z i z k θ h s z i z k finally the new projection index qq a in the ppdc model is as follow 7 qq a ss a dd a the projection index qq a measures the degree to which the data points in the projection are both concentrated locally ss a large while at the same time expanded globally dd a small 3 2 4 model and optimization according to the above analysis the ppdc model can be designed as the following nonlinear optimization problems 8 max qq a a 1 in this study the accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding was programmed and processed in matlab 7 01 wang et al 2006 jia et al 2018 and it was applied to optimize and calculate the ppdc model then the corresponding sub vector of the optimal projection direction obtained by calculation is the weight of parameter in groundwater vulnerability assessment 3 3 optimization of drastic method for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate the methodology developed in this study for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate attempted to retain the basic structure of drastic method and optimize it by fully considering the causes of groundwater nitrate pollution and eliminating the subjectivity of the weight rating and classification of the parameters kazakis and voudouris 2015 the modified contents include 1 optimization of the parameter system by replacing the qualitative with quantitative parameters and adding parameters to develop the dranthvp method 2 revision of the rating scale of each parameter and 3 determination of parameter weights using ppdc model the flow chart of the processes used to modify the drastic method for estimating groundwater vulnerability is shown in fig 2 3 3 1 optimization of the parameter system to groundwater vulnerability the parameter modifications were as follows 3 3 1 1 replacement of the aquifer media a with the aquifer thickness a the aquifer media a of the drastic method is a qualitative parameter prasad et al 2011 however there are few types of porous aquifers in the study area mainly sand and gravel in the assessment of groundwater specific vulnerability the dilution effect of groundwater on pollutants cannot be ignored the aquifer thickness not only reflects the size of groundwater storage space but also is a critical parameter to determine the dilution ability of groundwater to nitrate zhong 2005 huan et al 2012 in this study the aquifer thickness was selected instead of the aquifer media 3 3 1 2 replacement of the soil media s with the nitrate attenuation intensity n the soil media strongly affects the ability of pollutants to transport vertically to the vadose zone however the discretization of the soil media in the study area is small during biological denitrification anoxic environment is a necessary condition for the survival of denitrifying bacteria and soil organic matter is the nutrient and energy source for their reproduction and metabolism bending and turner 2009 accordingly soil oxygen content and organic matter content jointly control the denitrification intensity of microorganism which directly determines the total amount of no3 that can be efficiently converted and dissipated leifeld and kögel knabner 2005 in the same environment poor aeration and high content of soil organic matter will promote the growth and reproduction of denitrifying bacteria and affect the denitrification process resulting in the reduction of nitrate entering groundwater yun et al 2006 in addition soil moisture content and porosity are important indicators of soil aeration grundmann et al 1995 therefore according to the difference of soil moisture content porosity and organic matter content in the reclassified soil media each type of soil was assigned different relative values of nitrate attenuation intensity which replaced the soil media 3 3 1 3 using the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone h to represent the impact of the vadose zone i the vadose zone is the medium between the soil and aquifer and is also a necessary way for pollutants to enter the aquifer neshat et al 2015 however the lithology of the vadose zone is mainly dominated by subsandy soil in the porous aquifers of the study area so the discretization of the characteristics of the vadose zone in the drastic method is not obvious the hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone can be used to measure the relative transit time of pollutants from the surface through the vadose zone to the groundwater and the hydraulic resistance can be described by the ratio of the thickness of the vadose zone to their vertical hydraulic conductivity kazakis and voudouris 2015 accordingly the impact of the vadose zone was replaced by hydraulic resistance of quantitative parameter 3 3 1 4 replacement of the hydraulic conductivity c with the groundwater velocity v previous studies have shown a negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and nitrate panagopoulos et al 2006 busico et al 2017 and the same results have been shown in this study r 0 119 groundwater exploitation is one of the indicators of human activities affecting the vulnerability of groundwater and groundwater level differences hydraulic gradient caused by groundwater exploitation is an important factor determining groundwater velocity labaky et al 2010 the groundwater velocity can describe the range of groundwater nitrate pollution under the process of dispersion and advection huan et al 2012 meanwhile the groundwater velocity calculated by combining hydraulic gradient with hydraulic conductivity according to darcy s law sinan and razack 2009 was positively correlated with nitrate concentration therefore the hydraulic conductivity was replaced by groundwater velocity in the groundwater vulnerability assessment to nitrate 3 3 1 5 adding land use types and characterizing them with the pollutant input intensity p land use types are not included in the original drastic method but the amount of pollutant loads produced varies across land use types tasdighi et al 2017 the land use type is the key factor affecting the transport and transformation of nitrate in the vadose zone li et al 2012 therefore the land use type was added as a parameter of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution however the land use type is a qualitative parameter so each type of land use was assigned different relative values of pollutant input intensity according to the difference of pollution source type in land use types in this study gu et al 2013 thus the pollutant input intensity of quantitative parameter was used to characterize land use types the parameter system of the new method to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate comprised depth to groundwater d net recharge r aquifer thickness a nitrate attenuation intensity n topography t hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone h groundwater velocity v and pollutant input intensity p therefore the new method was abbreviated for dranthvp method 3 3 2 revision of the rating scale of each parameter the key to improving the accuracy of groundwater vulnerability assessment results is to improve the rationality of the rating scale assaf and saadeh 2009 in the dranthvp method each parameter was divided into 10 classes with a rating score from 1 to 10 by using simple statistical method panagopoulos et al 2006 in addition considering the requirement of ppdc model for initial data an upper limit value was added for the maximum range of each parameter according to the range of each parameter and the upper limit of the actual range of each parameter should not exceed this upper limit value 3 3 3 determination of the parameter weights using ppdc model reducing the interference of human factors and improving the objectivity of index weights are of great significance to the results of groundwater vulnerability assessment wu et al 2014 the parameter weights of the original drastic method are determined by subjective weighting method so the result is seriously interfered by human factors sahoo et al 2016 moreover the same hydrogeological parameter has different impacts on groundwater vulnerability in various regions neshat et al 2015 therefore the parameter weights of the drastic method modified must be reassigned ppdc model not only has strong objectivity but also can maintain the structural characteristics of high dimensional data ni et al 2006 consequently ppdc model was used for the first time to determine the weight of each parameter in the vulnerability assessment method in this study and the influence degree of each parameter on the assessment results can be determined based on the optimal projection direction in this study 30 values were randomly generated within the range of each rating class of the 8 parameters since the rating scale of the dranthvp method was divided into 10 classes a total of 300 standard samples were obtained then the optimal projection direction was calculated on the basis of the calculation procedure of the ppdc model 3 4 data sampling and analysis human cultivation and the overuse of fertilizers have resulted in a large amount of nitrogen entering the soil and water which has increased the pollution of nitrate to groundwater in the plain area of western jilin province jianmin et al 2015 ghahremanzadeh et al 2017 mohammad et al 2018 therefore nitrate was taken as the typical pollutant in this study in the wet period from june to september crops are growing and fertilization activities are frequent resulting in more serious nitrate pollution in groundwater than in other periods kumazawa 2002 consequently a total of 120 groundwater samples were monitored and collected by stratified sampling method during the wet period of the 2014 hydrological year fig 1 and the sampling depth was within 10 50 m of porous phreatic aquifers plastic bottles 500 ml were used for storing and transporting the samples the samples were then analyzed for no3 using the thermo scientific evolution 201 uv visible spectrophotometer all of the data that include parameters in the groundwater vulnerability assessment to nitrate were obtained from different sources a summary of data types sources and output layers is shown in table 2 groundwater level measurements were performed in 271 observation wells during the wet and dry periods of the 2013 2015 hydrological years the groundwater depth map was generated from the mean value of the 6 periods average annual rainfall at 11 rainfall stations from 1985 to 2015 was prepared to estimate the recharge the aquifer media aquifer thickness and the impact of the vadose zone were obtained from geologic section formations using 106 drilling profiles at depths of approximately 120 m the soil media map and land use map were downloaded from the website of the chinese academy of sciences liu et al 2018 and the data of the pollutant input intensity was derived from the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure gu et al 2013 topographical map was based on dem digital elevation data with 30 m resolution in the study area the soil moisture content porosity and organic matter content were determined by physical and chemical analysis of 185 soil samples the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer can be estimated by pumping test the hydraulic resistance can be described by the ratio of the thickness of the vadose zone to their vertical hydraulic conductivity kazakis and voudouris 2015 based on the hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity the groundwater velocity was estimated using the groundwater darcy s velocity model package of arcgis 9 3 software sinan and razack 2009 here the grading methods of equal interval natural breaks quantile and geometrical intervals have been used to define the class ranges of each parameter in vulnerability assessment huan et al 2012 in addition the groundwater vulnerability index to nitrate was graded by geometrical interval method kazakis and voudouris 2015 3 5 validation of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate in this study the correlation between groundwater vulnerability index and nitrate concentration al amoush et al 2010 and analysis of variance of f statistic were adopted to verify the reliability and accuracy of the applied method bryman and cramer 1997 pearson s r correlation factor was used to validate the vulnerability index and rating of parameter fink 1995 kazakis and voudouris 2015 however the statistical significance of the shapiro wilk s test of the nitrate data shows that the available data does not satisfy the assumption of pearson s r correlation factor that the nitrate concentration is a normal distribution ahlgren et al 2014 therefore the nitrate concentration data were logarithmically transformed before correlation analysis panagopoulos et al 2006 analysis of the variance anova f statistic was used for the significance test of the mean difference between samples bryman and cramer 1997 in this study the anova f statistic was used to characterize the overlap degree between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes the larger the anova f statistic the less overlap between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes and the higher the accuracy of the evaluation results lake et al 2003 the anova f statistic can be calculated by eq 9 9 f mst mse sst k 1 sse n k where mst and mse are respectively the mean square and mean square for error sst and sse are respectively the sum of squares for treatment and the sum of squares for error k 1 and n k are respectively the freedom degree for treatment and freedom degree for error 4 results and discussion 4 1 original groundwater vulnerability assessment to nitrate on the arcgis platform the score vector map of each parameter fig 3a g in the drastic method was respectively extracted and analyzed the rating ranks of parameters were shown in table 3 aller et al 1987 the intrinsic vulnerability index of porous aquifers can be calculated by weighted sum in gis environment thus the assessment results of the intrinsic vulnerability and the correlation with nitrate concentrations in the study area were illustrated in fig 4 the vulnerability index was in the range from 0 12 to 8 75 and was classified into five classes of vulnerability very low low medium high and very high the results indicate that the correlation between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration is very low r 0 204 and 88 68 of the total study area exhibits the low or medium classes of vulnerability fig 8 the specific vulnerability index to nitrate drasticl method was produced by spatial superposition of the drastic index and the score vector map of land uses fig 3h antonakos and lambrakis 2007 the land use types and their assigned rating values were shown in table 1 and the normalized weight of land uses was set to 0 22 which was the same as the depth of groundwater and impact of the vadose zone sinan and razack 2009 kazakis and voudouris 2015 the results were presented in fig 5 although the discretization of vulnerability classes in the study area has been significantly improved fig 8 the correlation between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration is still low r 0 259 these observations led to the conclusion that neither the original drastic method nor the drasticl method with added land use can reflect the actual groundwater vulnerability to nitrate the use of qualitative parameters and the ignorance of the objective characteristics of the actual aquifer are responsible for the low correlation between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration therefore optimization of parameters revision of the rating and objective determination of parameter weights are considered as necessary conditions to increase the reliability of groundwater vulnerability assessment to nitrate 4 2 application and validation of dranthvp method for groundwater vulnerability to nitrate the dranthvp method based on the drastic method modified significantly improves the reliability and representativeness of the vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate revised ranges and ratings of the dranthvp method parameters were listed in table 4 according to the revised rating scale the thematic maps of the eight parameters fig 6 in the dranthvp method were re extracted through the arcgis platform it can be seen from fig 6 that the discretization of each parameter was significantly improved and the correlation between parameters and nitrate concentration was also significantly increased table 5 based on the revised rating scale the eight parameter weights of the dranthvp method were determined according to the calculation procedure of the ppdc model in this study the accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding was applied to optimize the ppdc model in which m 8 n 300 and n 10 and was programmed in matlab 7 01 and calculated by computer after 18 iterations the optimal projection direction was obtained a 0 331 0 290 0 305 0 443 0 227 0 269 0 353 0 517 and the parameter weights of the dranthvp method was determined table 5 after modifications of parameters ratings and weights eq 10 can be converted as follows 10 dranthvp index 0 121 d 0 106 r 0 112 a 0 162 n 0 083 t 0 098 h 0 129 v 0 189 p where d r a n t h v p were defined earlier in addition according to the optimal projection direction the influence degree of each parameter on groundwater vulnerability assessment results can be further determined and their order from large to small is as follows p n v d a r h and t therefore the pollutant input intensity is the most influential parameter for groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the plain area of western jilin province followed by the nitrate attenuation intensity the dranthvp method was applied to assess the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the plain area of western jilin province the assessment results of the groundwater vulnerability and the correlation with nitrate concentrations in the study area were illustrated in fig 7 the results show that the application of the dranthvp method significantly increases the correlation coefficient between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration r 0 720 in addition the groundwater vulnerability using the dranthvp method still maintains a high degree of discretization of the vulnerability classes in porous aquifers and the vulnerability index ranged from 1 08 to 9 04 and was classified into five classes as shown in fig 7 the areas with the highest vulnerability are located in the eastern part of the fuyu city the baicheng city in the northwestern part and the qian an county in the south central of the study area these areas cover part of the built up areas with higher population density or the agricultural areas with poor management which are related to high levels of pollutant emissions pollutant emissions mainly come from a variety of sources with high nitrogen content such as domestic sewage industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation and fertilization the hydrogeological characteristics of these areas do not prevent the nitrogen pollutants produced from entering aquifers so the groundwater in aquifers is more vulnerable to nitrate pollution in addition the western area of tongyu county and the nen river bank area in the northeast of the study area have lower contamination vulnerabilities the land use types in these areas are mainly wetlands woodlands and grasslands and nitrogen pollutant input intensity are low so the possibility of nitrate pollution in groundwater was reduced the areas with the medium vulnerability accounted for about a quarter of the total study area and are widely distributed fig 8 illustrates that 38 02 of the plain area of western jilin province exhibits very low or low classes of vulnerability furthermore 21 67 of the study area exhibits high class of vulnerability and 16 88 of the study area exhibits very high class of vulnerability the correlation value indicates the applicability and reliability of the methods applied in the study area as shown in table 6 compared with the original drastic method r 0 204 the correlation coefficient of the dranthvp method r 0 720 was significantly increased by more than three times in addition when the dranthvp method was applied the resulting variance of the anova f statistic test was greater than the original drastic and drasticl methods indicating that there was less overlap between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes by comparing the class areas of the drastic drasticl and dranthvp methods fig 8 the original drastic indices underestimate the vulnerability of the aquifer to nitrate since only 0 01 of the study area exhibits very low class of vulnerability at the same time the drasticl indices also underestimate the vulnerability of the aquifer because up to 48 77 of the study area exhibits very low or low classes of vulnerability however the dranthvp method produced a more uniform distribution of vulnerability classes these results indicate that the optimized parameters and the weights determined using the ppdc model in the dranthvp method is scientific and reliable and the dranthvp method based on the drastic method modified can more accurately evaluate the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the plain area of western jilin province in this study only one sampling event during the wet period was adopted however the groundwater vulnerability to nitrate in porous aquifers still needs more continuous work under complex climate change and human activities for example groundwater samples from different periods will be collected and tested to obtain more scientific and reliable results of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate which can overcome the limitations of this study 5 conclusions it is important to evaluate the potential groundwater contamination in arid and semiarid areas where groundwater is the main source of water the overuse of fertilizers in farming has increased nitrate pollution in groundwater in the study area considering that the original drastic and drasticl methods cannot reflect the actual groundwater vulnerability to nitrate this study developed the dranthvp method to assess the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrate in the plain area of western jilin province in this study the drastic method was first optimized by replacing the original parameters aquifer media soil media impact of the vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity with quantitative parameters aquifer thickness nitrate attenuation intensity hydraulic resistance and groundwater velocity and adding pollutant input intensity so the dranthvp method was developed then the rating scale of parameters was revised and the ppdc model was used for the first time to determine parameter weights of the dranthvp method and the influence degree of each parameter on the assessment results the results indicate that the pollutant input intensity is the most influential parameters in the plain area of western jilin province followed by the nitrate attenuation intensity the results of vulnerability assessment indicate that the correlation coefficient between vulnerability index and nitrate concentration using the dranthvp method was 0 720 which was more than three times that of the original drastic method and the high variance of the anova f statistic indicated that there was less overlap between the nitrate values in different vulnerability classes furthermore the dranthvp method produced a more uniform distribution of vulnerability classes the dranthvp method provides a complete approach for estimating the groundwater vulnerability of porous aquifers to nitrates and the ppdc model provides a new idea for optimizing the weights of parameters in groundwater vulnerability assessment at the same time the mapping of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate can provide a scientific and reasonable basis for the formulation of groundwater resource protection plan

1561,the effect of sulfate presence on reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes has been a matter of conflict among the limited reports found in literature this paper aims to clarify the misconceptions regarding the performance of trichloroethene biotransformation under sulfate reducing conditions by evaluating the effect of different sulfate concentrations on reductive dechlorination and to assess the influence of electron donor dose on dechlorination rate to this end batch experiments containing different sulfate and butyrate concentrations were conducted using trichloroethene dechlorinating and sulfate reducing parent cultures results demonstrated that if sufficient time and electron donor is provided complete dechlorination can be achieved even at up to 400 mg l initial sulfate concentration however the rate of dichloroethene and vinyl chloride degradation is reduced as sulfide concentration increases moreover the excess electron donor dose induced a slightly slower dechlorination rate the findings of this paper present an explanatory framework for the dechlorination of tce under sulfate reducing conditions and can contribute to the state of art bioremediation of contaminated sites keywords trichloroethene tce sulfate reduction dechlorination sulfide inhibition 1 introduction trichloroethylene tce a known human carcinogen usepa 2011 is widely used by the military as well as the commercial and industrial sectors as a degreasing solvent jin et al 2008 moran et al 2007 significant usage along with improper disposal practices have led to a widespread groundwater contamination worldwide who 2011 huang et al 2014 one major pathway for tce removal is biologically mediated reductive dechlorination a sequential electron transfer process where a chlorine atom is replaced by hydrogen under anaerobic conditions majone et al 2015 hence tce is converted to less chlorinated compounds such as dichloroethylene isomers mainly to cis dce and secondarily to trans dce and 1 1 dce vinyl chloride vc and eventually ethene eth löffler and edwards 2006 various bacteria species have the ability to metabolize chloroethenes jugder et al 2015 saiyari et al 2018 however only dehalococcoides mccartyi can achieve a complete transformation of tce to ethene by using solely hydrogen as the electron source löffler et al 2013 typically a mixed community that achieves complete or partial reductive dechlorination consists of a variety of microorganisms that carry out many other processes table a 1 reviews the microbial content of mixed cultures and contaminated sites that is presented in the literature in brief it is observed that either dehalococcoides spp or fermentative microorganisms such as synergistetes and bacteroidetes are predominant in dechlorinating communities other groups often detected are the following a microorganisms that cause partial dechlorination like geobacter spp and sulfurospirillum spp b the methanogenic archaea methanosarcinales and methanomicrobiales c acetogens such as spirochaetes phylum acetobacterium and sporomusa genus and d proteobacteria phylum especially gamma and delta proteobacteria that contains nitrate sulfate and iron reducing bacteria hence under anaerobic conditions several types of organic substrates can be oxidized by fermentative microorganisms to provide hydrogen and acetate hug et al 2012 dechlorinators are competing for electron donor with methanogens homoacetogens sulfate reducers and iron reducing bacteria adrian and löffler 2016 see table a 2 for half reactions and gibbs free energy thus the competition for molecular hydrogen is an important key factor for chloroethene removal efficiency badin et al 2016 previous studies found that reductive dechlorination is more thermodynamically favorable than methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis under hydrogen limiting conditions smatlak et al 1996 ballapragada et al 1997 fennell et al 1997 also observed that the addition of slowly degrading organic substrates like butyrate or propionate can lead to dechlorinators prevalence over methanogens due to their higher affinity for hydrogen see table a 3 for hydrogen threshold concentration of each process however the effect of sulfate reduction on dechlorination has been less studied and the available results are often inconsistent and contradictory chambon et al 2012 sulfate is ubiquitous in groundwater miao et al 2012 and is often reported in organohalide contaminated sites at concentrations up to 2880 mg l mao et al 2017 while the maximum permissible sulfate concentration above which reductive dechlorination is considered to be limited ranges in technical protocols from 20 mg l wiedemeier et al 1998 to 500 mg l parsons corporation 2004 a review of twelve field case studies showed that chlorinated ethene biotransformation can be successful even at elevated sulfate concentrations provided sufficient donor and time as well as a dense population of dehalococcoides mccartyi are available therefore the presence of sulfate seems to adversely affect the biotransformation rate rather than the completion of dechlorination pantazidou et al 2012 moreover the yield of chloroethene removal appears to vary also in laboratory studies ranging from ethene production hoelen and reinhard 2004 heimann et al 2005 aulenta et al 2008 to an incomplete dechlorination el mamouni et al 2002 boopathy and peters 2001 révész et al 2006 sung 2005 table 1 shows the results of reductive dechlorination performance in the presence of sulfate from experiments published in the last decade 2008 2018 the screening criteria for the studies presented herein were the following a experiments had to be under sulfate reducing or thermodynamically less favorable conditions and b microcosms should be soil free to avoid high iron content table 1 indicates that as sulfate concentration increases the progress of dechlorination is delayed but the degree of effectiveness seems to differ depending on the composition of the culture particularly experiments conducted by aulenta et al 2008 showed a slower ethene production at 360 mg l 3 75 mm sulfate compared to zero sulfate microcosms however the microbial community was not acclimated to elevated sulfate concentrations so only 60 of sulfate was depleted to sulfide on the contrary in mixtures of dehalococcoides sp and desulfovibrio sp pure cultures a rise of sulfate concentration from 192 mg l 2 mm to 480 mg l 5 mm caused the accumulation of tce and the complete depletion of sulfate mao et al 2017 in addition to the competition for the electron donor sulfide concentration has an inhibitory effect on reductive dechlorination hoelen and reinhard 2004 in experiments with 2 mm sulfide in liquid the accumulation of cis dce was observed while at lower concentrations pce was converted to ethene complete inhibition occurred when hydrogen sulfide aqueous concentration reached 5 mm sung 2005 nonetheless acclimatized cultures showed that the reductive dechlorination efficiency was similar under methanogenic condition and at 3 4 mm sulfide panagiotakis 2010 moreover sulfide toxicity could be specific to certain dechlorinating species since no inhibition was observed at a sulfidogenic site hoelen et al 2006 the conflicting findings complicate the interpretation of field and laboratory data and contribute to misconceptions regarding the competition mechanisms in mixed sulfate reducing and dechlorinating cultures the objectives of this study are a to evaluate the effect of sulfate reduction in the presence of various sulfate concentrations on reductive dechlorination b to investigate whether the increase of electron donor addition can speed up the dechlorination rate and c to examine the influence of excess electron donor dose on reductive processes to this end batch experiments containing four different sulfate concentrations were conducted 0 70 150 and 400 mg l with low 0 3 0 9 mm medium 2 2 3 mm and high 9 1 mm butyrate doses using trichloroethene dechlorinating and sulfate reducing parent cultures 2 materials and methods 2 1 parent culture development within the context of this study parent cultures were developed at various sulfate concentrations in order to provide biomass for the batch experiments that was exposed to selected sulfate concentrations that ranged from 0 to 400 mg l the enrichment of the cultures is described in detail in supplementary material and is illustrated in fig a 1 in brief all parent cultures were in duplicates with different initial sulfate concentration by adjusting on weekly basis the concentration of sulfate to four levels s0 0 mm zero sulfate s70 0 73 mm or 70 mg l s150 1 56 mm or 150 mg l and s400 4 16 mm or 400 mg l and were maintained for approximately 2 to 6 years all cultures were fed with basal medium tandoi et al 1994 vitamin solution balch et al 1979 yeast extract and selenium tungsten solution widdel 1988 at the same time 0 188 mmoles tce per bottle 0 5 mm or 65 7 mg l tce nominal concentration i e total amount added to the bottle divided by liquid volume and 0 113 mmoles butyrate per bottle 0 3 mm or 27 0 mg l which served as electron donor were added the quantity of the electron donor was adequate only for 40 of the required reducing equivalents for complete dechlorination of tce to ethene assuming conservatively that butyrate yields 4 eq mol without taking into account the presence of sulfate all parent cultures were acclimatized for a period of at least 300 days prior to providing biomass for the batch experiments at the end of each weekly cycle sulfate tce and butyrate were measured and the amount to be added was estimated to reach the default concentrations for the beginning of the next cycle also measurements of chlorinated ethenes ethene methane and volatile fatty acid vfas were carried out to evaluate the overall performance fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis was employed to investigate the composition of parent cultures and to identify the various groups of microorganisms that take part in the redox reactions 2 2 experimental procedures nine batch experiments were conducted in 160 ml serum bottles with a headspace gas to liquid ratio 6 10 thus containing 100 ml of liquid volume a 15 of the liquid volume was basal medium selenium tungsten solution and vitamin solution bottles were flushed with n2 co2 70 30 sealed with teflon rubber stopper and aluminum crimp caps to maintain anaerobic conditions batch experiments were kept at 25 c with magnetic stirring in the dark as in parent cultures the initial trichloroethene nominal concentration was 0 5 mm 65 7 mg l or 0 05 mmoles bottle in all batch tests the initial butyrate and sulfate concentrations for each duplicate pair are shown in table 2 which groups the batch tests in three sets according to the type of question under study concerning i the effect of low electron donor quantities on reductive dechlorination under sulfate reducing conditions ii the effect of a moderate but adequate electron donor quantity on reductive dechlorination under different sulfate concentrations and iii the effect of adding electron donor in excess of dechlorination and sulfate reduction requirements all batch experiments were conducted in duplicates all values reported in tables and figures are mean values of the duplicates accompanied by standard deviation as shown in table 2 five different butyrate doses were selected that ranged from 0 3 mm to 9 1 mm in order to evaluate the effect of sulfate concentrations on dechlorination under limiting and non limiting electron donor conditions as already mentioned batch experiments conducted with the addition of a low dose of 0 3 mm butyrate provided only 40 of the required reducing equivalents for complete dechlorination of tce to ethene assuming that butyrate yields 4 eq mol under these conditions once the electron donor i e butyrate is fully depleted the electron acceptor i e sulfate is expected to remain since it has been supplied in larger amounts than can be reduced by the donor provided in this way a highly competitive environment is established which is the anticipated regime for natural attenuation scenarios on the other hand batch experiments conducted with the addition of 2 2 mm and 9 1 mm butyrate provided adequate electron donor for complete dechlorination and sulfate reduction with initial sulfate concentrations of 70 mg l and 400 mg l respectively therefore these experiments simulate remediation by biostimulation in sulfate rich aquifers contaminated by chlorinated ethenes 2 3 materials for the purpose of this study the following chemicals were

linde 2 4 analytical procedures and program two headspace samples 50 μl each were obtained approximately every day on the first week and periodically afterwards for the analysis of ethene and methane in one sample and chlorinated ethenes ces in the other sample for the quantification of the above a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and a plot column gs gaspro 30 m 0 32 mm diameter j w folsom ca was used two isothermal methods were employed at 160 c for the measurement of chlorinated ethenes and at 50 c for methane and ethene while the injector was held at 220 c and the detector at 250 c in both cases standards were prepared by adding a known mass of each compound to 160 ml serum bottles with 100 ml deionized water resulting in 6 10 headspace to liquid ratio the same as the experiments results for chlorinated ethenes methane and ethene are expressed either as mass per bottle or as nominal concentrations i e total mass of compound in the bottle divided by liquid volume in the results section the aqueous concentrations of chloroethenes ethene and methane were calculated using henry law gossett 1987 as follows 1 c aqueous m total v l v h h r t where

quantification of volatile fatty acids 200 μl of liquid samples were obtained periodically then filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filter and stored at minus 20 c the samples were placed into 150 μl vials micro inserts and acidified with 2 v v hcl 2 n 0 5 μl of the pretreated liquid samples were injected in a gas chromatograph equipped with an autosampler a fused silica capillary column nukol 15

spectrophotometer at the end of the experiments the liquid of the batch tests was used for sulfide measurement and biomass determination 100 μl of liquid sample were withdrawn with a gas tight syringe for quantification of sulfide using method 690 of hach lange dr2800 spectrophotometer standards were prepared by injecting a known amount of sulfide to sealed 160 ml serum bottles with 100 ml deionized water as described above results of sulfide are also expressed as mass per bottle and as nominal concentration the sulfide content in aqueous solution was calculated according to eq 1 biomass content was determined as volatile suspended solids vss according to standard methods apha 2005 and as total protein lowry et al 1951 for protein analysis 1 ml liquid sample was stored at 20 c until the pretreatment with solubilization this was achieved by centrifuging the sample at 10000 rpm for 30 min extracting 500 μl of supernatant adding 400 μl naoh 0 1 n re centrifuging and then 550 μl of supernatant was placed in a 1 5 ml tube with 250 μl hcl 0 1 n standards were prepared with a known concentration of bovine serum albumin deionized water and 3 57 mm nahco3 same as batch experiments the repeatability was 16 1 and 11 3 for vss and total protein respectively 2 5 metrics alternative metrics can serve as tools for the quantification of dechlorination efficiency and comparison purposes an aggregate measure mole fraction of chloroethenes ncl was used to describe the rate of each step of dechlorination according to the following equation 2 n cl dces 2 vc 3 eth tce dces vc eth thus ncl tracks the formulation stages of the desired final product ethene by taking values from 0 no ethene production to 3 complete transformation to ethene heimann et al 2005 the selected metrics which focus on reductive dechlorination are shown in table a 5 2 6 electron balance calculations electron distribution percent among anaerobic dechlorination methanogenesis and sulfate reduction was calculated according to the following molar equivalent factors 2 eq mol for each cl released i e for each step of the sequential dechlorination 8 eq mol methane produced and 8 eq mol sulfate reduced assuming that sulfide is the end product of sulfate reduction aulenta et al 2008 likewise electron donor consumption was calculated according to 4 eq mol butyrate used 1 mol of butyrate yields 2 mol of acetate and 2 mol of h2 8 eq mol acetate used 1 mol of acetate yields 2 mol of co2 and 4 mol of h2 and 20 eq mol for dead biomass yielding h2 assuming that 1 g vss is equivalent to 1 g c5h7o2n adamson and newell 2009 sleep et al 2005 in order to eliminate precision errors in batch experiments the electron balance recovery was calculated as follows and the permissible range of values was between 75 125 3 electron balance total electron usage meq l total electron donor meq l 2 7 biomass characterization occasionally samples were taken from s0 s150 and s400 to identify the different groups of microorganisms that coexist in parent cultures fish was employed according to the procedure described elsewhere mamais et al 2016 panousi et al 2016 the probes that were used alongside with formamide and nacl concentrations are shown in table a 6 in table a 7 results are expressed as a fraction of the specific binding of hybridized cells out of the total dapi cells probe dapi in addition three batch tests in duplicate were conducted to investigate the disappearance of butyrate in the first days of the experiments hence one day long ancillary experiments with three initial concentrations of sulfate 0 150 400 mg l were carried out according to the protocol described above see experimental procedures initial butyrate was 9 1 mm in all bottles a control test was also conducted using the s400 parent culture but butyrate was not added therefore the electron donor concentration was minimal after one day of operation samples were withdrawn for the measurement of chloroethenes ethene methane volatile fatty acids sulfate and biomass moreover microscopic examinations for the characterization of biomass were performed according to eikelboom and van buijsen 1981 and jenkins et al 1993 the neisser staining procedure was employed for the identification of poly hydroxybutyrate phb inclusions in the microorganisms all microscopic observations were performed at 1000 magnifications by using a phase contrast microscope nikon eclipse 80 3 results discussion 3 1 parent culture performance τhe long term performance of parent cultures in terms of weekly values is presented in table a 7 mean values of cis dichloroethene cdce vinyl chloride vc ethene eth methane mth remaining sulfate and acetate ac with standard deviations for each duplicate pair of the parent cultures are shown along with days of operation on the 1st day trichloroethene tce as well as butyrate but were depleted in all duplicate pairs as shown in fig a 2 until day 7 most of tce transformed to vc since 84 93 91 and 89 of total chloroethenes accumulated as vc in s0 s70 s150 and s400 respectively furthermore molecular analysis of parent cultures showed that dehalococcoides spp thrives even in the presence of sulfate as already observed in literature panagiotakis et al 2014 compared to other dechlorinating communities found in the literature table a 1 the cultures used herein have a typical microbial composition containing mainly organohalide respiring bacteria acetogens methanogenic archaea and deltaproteobacteria acetate was mostly depleted in s70 s150 and s400 but occasionally a small amount accumulated especially in s0 acetate concentrations were unstable in the approximately 1600 days of operation resulting in an inconsistent methane production regarding electron donor competition sulfate reduction was similar in s70 s150 and s400 despite the different initial concentration methanogenesis appears to be inhibited by sulfate reduction since methane was produced only in zero sulfate cultures similar results have also been observed by aulenta et al 2008 where about 23 and 0 2 of the original electron donor was used for methanogenesis at zero and 3 75 mm sulfate concentration respectively this trend is reinforced by fish results since the methanogenic archaea percentage is lower under sulfate reducing conditions ranging from to 4 to 10 likewise sulfate concentration seems to affect acetogens too considering that acetobacterium spp population was 39 and 20 of total dapi cells in s0 and s400 respectively on the contrary deltaproteobacteria seems to increase in s150 and s400 cultures mainly due to higher population of sulfate reducing bacteria the above finding may be caused by sulfide toxicity because methanogens are sensitive to hydrogen sulfide exposure scherr et al 2011 it could also be due to the competition for the electron donor since the sulfate reducing microorganisms maintain the level of hydrogen below the threshold for methanogenic archaea and homoacetogens yang and mccarty 1998 see table a 3 3 2 effect of sulfate concentrations on reductive dechlorination under low electron donor conditions the aim of these experiments was to investigate the effect of sulfate on reductive dechlorination under limiting electron donor conditions to this end the s150 parent culture was used as biomass for the batch experiments that are presented in table 2 containing low donor doses of 26 4 mg l 0 3 mm and 80 0 mg l 0 9 the added quantities of butyrate were adequate only for 40 and 121 of the required reducing equivalents for biotransformation of tce to ethene figs a 3 and a 4 illustrate a chlorinated ethenes ethene methane sulfate nominal concentrations and b vfas concentrations in s150 b0 3 and s150 b0 9 experiments respectively results demonstrate that tce disappeared on day 1 while cdce transformed after 12 days in s150 b0 3 and after 4 days in s150 b0 9 however complete dechlorination was not achieved as 0 041 mmoles bottle 82 of the tce initially added and 0 030 mmoles bottle vc 60 of the tce initially added remained at 181 days of operation in experiments with 0 3 mm and 0 9 mm butyrate respectively sulfate was reduced by 55 in s150 b0 3 experiment and methane was not detected but when the donor quantity tripled all sulfate converted to sulfide and a small quantity of methane was produced reaching up to 0 066 mmoles bottle butyrate and acetate were depleted in both experiments with low electron doses and endogenous decay provided the electrons needed yielding 27 2 and 12 5 of total electron equivalents produced according the vss content mcguire et al 2006 and sleep et al 2005 also noticed that reductive dechlorination will continue even years after electron donor consumption at a slow stable rate due to dead biomass oxidation thus 0 3 mm and 0 9 mm of butyrate were inadequate quantities for reductive processes and can cause a delay in chlorinated ethenes removal therefore under low electron donor conditions encountered in natural attenuation scenarios reductive dechlorination is expected to stall in sulfate rich aquifers 3 3 effect of sulfate concentrations on reductive dechlorination under medium electron donor conditions the aim of these experiments was to investigate whether the increase of electron donor addition can speed up the dechlorination rate and alleviate the negative effect of sulfates on dechlorination expected in sulfate rich contaminated aquifers batch experiments were conducted employing parent cultures s0 s70 s150 and s400 that were fed on a weekly basis with 0 70 mg l 150 mg l and 400 mg l sulfate respectively additionally all parent cultures received weekly 65 7 mg l tce nominal concentration and 27 0 mg l butyrate as shown in table 2 each batch experiment presented herein illustrates the long term performance of each culture when exposed to similar initial conditions as in parent cultures with respect to tce and sulfate but at medium butyrate doses of 194 mg l 2 2 mm or 264 mg l 3 0 mm compared to the parent cultures the batch experiments were conducted at a much higher electron donor availability in order to evaluate whether the supplementary donor addition is able to reduce the dechlorination lag obtained in the presence of different sulfate concentrations adopting the conservative assumption that butyrate yields 4 eq mol the amount of butyrate added provided adequate electron donor for 100 dechlorination and sulfate reduction with initial sulfate concentrations of 70 mg l for the batch experiments conducted at higher sulfate concentrations the amount of electron donor provided was ample for dechlorination but not sufficient for both chloroethene and sulfate reduction figs 1 to 4 demonstrate the reductive dechlorination methanogenesis sulfate reduction and vfas oxidation during the operation of s0 b3 0 s70 b2 2 s150 b3 0 s400 b3 0 experiments the results show that in all batch experiments complete dechlorination was achieved but increasing sulfate concentration requires extended time of operation since dechlorination rates decrease even at the elevated sulfate concentration of 400 mg l vc concentration gradually decreased to nearly zero after 250 days of operation consequently complete dechlorination can be achieved this result is consistent with hoelen and reinhard 2004 where complete dechlorination of tetrachloroethene pce was observed after 1000 days with 240 mg l sulfate according to the results of the batch experiments tce was consumed in the first day of operation regardless of the initial sulfate concentration on the other hand cdce was depleted in 1 5 days in zero sulfate experiments and in 5 6 days in bottles with sulfate addition about 1 of the initial tce remained as vc after 5 83 171 and 366 days in experiments with zero s0 b3 0 fig 1 0 7 mm s70 b2 2 fig 2 1 6 mm s150 b3 0 fig 3 and 4 2 mm s400 b3 0 fig 4 initial sulfate concentrations respectively as it is shown in table 3 and fig 5 the dechlorination step affected by initial sulfate concentration increase is the reductive limiting step of vc transformation as sulfate increases the rate of vc reduction is decreasing affecting the period needed for complete dechlorination specifically average 1st order vc dechlorination rates decreased with increasing sulfate concentration from 3 14 day 1 in cultures exposed to zero initial sulfate concentration to 0 07 day 1 0 03 day 1 and 0 01 day 1 in cultures exposed to 70 mg l 150 mg l and 400 mg l initial sulfate concentration respectively as shown in figs 2a 3a and 4a sulfate is rapidly consumed at the elevated sulfate concentration of 400 mg l towards the end of the experiment sulfide mass reached up to 0 36 mmoles bottle 3 6 mm or 123 mg l sulfide nominal concentration indicating that approximately 87 of sulfate was transformed to sulfide hence the dechlorination results illustrate that complete dechlorination can be achieved under sulfide nominal concentrations up to 123 mg l 2 9 mm or 99 mg l concentration in liquid but at a much lower rate supporting the general belief found in the literature that sulfide can cause inhibition of dechlorination sung 2005 he et al 2005 mao et al 2017 hoelen and reinhard 2004 moreover as table a 2 shows sulfate reduction occurs by sulfate reducing microorganisms that use either butyrate to produce acetate and sulfide or acetate and hydrogen produced by syntrophic butyrate oxidizing bacteria the latter butyrate oxidation is feasible in the presence of an active hydrogenotrophic bacteria that renders the reaction thermodynamically stable panagiotakis et al 2014 in all experiments sulfate was degraded within a period of 30 days consuming a high percentage of butyrate and the remaining acetate was the only source of electrons for the depletion of vc however previous studies have shown that acetate is not a desirable donor to use for anaerobic dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes wen et al 2015 lee et al 2007 methanogenesis was not observed in the presence of sulfate only when sulfate was completely reduced methane production commenced within a period of 50 150 days figs 2a 3a and 4a the delay of methane production shows that sulfate reducers outcompete methanogens for electron equivalents differences between starting days of methane production were observed between duplicate experiments too causing high deviations at the measurements of volatile fatty acids and methane at the end of s70 b2 2 and s150 b3 0 experiments sulfate concentration was 0 02 mm 2 mg l in both cases while sulfide was 1 4 mm or 46 mg l in liquid 1 69 mm or 54 mg l nominal concentration in s150 b3 not measured in s70 b2 2 in all experiments except s0 b3 0 butyrate was depleted in the first days of the experiments producing acetate acetate stabilized for a period of time in s70 b2 2 and s150 b3 0 batch experiments since butyrate alone could provide the total electron equivalents for sulfate reduction and the electrons derived from acetate were used mainly for methanogenesis so methanogenesis was the predominant electron accepting process in all bottles utilizing 50 75 of the total electron equivalents used reductive dechlorination used only 41 2 9 0 7 2 and 5 1 of the total electron equivalents in s0 b3 0 s70 b2 2 s150 b3 0 and s400 b3 0 respectively 3 4 effect of excess electron donor addition on reductive dechlorination in view of the positive effect of electron donor addition on reductive dechlorination a second set of batch experiments was conducted in order to evaluate dechlorination efficiency in the presence of excess electron donor three more experiments were conducted with increased butyrate concentration up to 9 1 mm 800 mg l with zero s0 b9 1 1 6 mm s150 b9 1 and 4 2 mm s400 b9 1 sulfate concentrations figs 6 7 and 8 illustrate the a reductive dechlorination methanogenesis and sulfate reduction b butyrate propionate isobutyrate and acetate oxidation throughout the duration of experiments s0 b9 1 s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 respectively as shown in the figures complete dechlorination was only achieved in the zero sulfate experiment s0 b9 1 on the 5th day of operation in the other two experiments although ethene was formed a quantity of vc remained until the end of operation approximately 20 vc remained of total chlorinated ethene concentration in s150 b9 1 and 8 in s400 b9 1 moreover tce reduction rate decreased with electron donor addition it was observed that the tce zero order reduction rate was 0 104 mmoles day 0 099 mmoles day 0 046 mmoles day and 0 026 mmoles day at s150 b0 3 s150 b0 9 s150 b3 0 and s150 b9 1 experiments respectively a similar trend was noted in zero sulfate experiments where the velocity of tce removal was 0 140 mmoles day in 3 0 mm and 0 086 mmoles day in 9 1 mm butyrate el mamouni et al 2002 also observed that increasing electron donor concentration hinders chloroethenes removal efficiency the tce removal rates obtained with excess electron donor may have been influenced by the slightly lower ph values measured in bottles with excess electron donor compared to medium butyrate doses ph was in the 6 55 6 78 range specifically ph was 6 28 0 03 6 35 0 05 and 6 34 0 06 in s0 b9 1 s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 respectively in batch experiments conducted with excess donor addition sulfate reduction was complete similarly to the intermediate butyrate concentration producing 0 18 mmoles bottle 1 5 mm concentration in liquid and 0 36 mmoles bottle 2 9 mm concentratin in liquid sulfide in s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 experiments respectively however methanogenesis was observed only in s0 b9 1 experiment in s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 even after sulfate reduction methane concentration remained very low approximately 0 002 0 004 mmoles bottle it is anticipated that high acetate levels approximately 6 6 mm and 12 7 mm at the end of s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 experiments respectively inhibited methane production in all experiments butyrate was not depleted but the concentration decreased as the total sulfate reduction increased the produced acetate remained constant throughout the duration of the experiments for comparison purposes values extracted from batch experiments with medium butyrate concentration 3 mm are repeated in table 4 and fig 9 results show that high butyrate levels do not enhance dechlorination performance and in some cases have a negative effect on dechlorination although sulfate reducing bacteria srb are competing with dechlorinating bacteria significantly increasing electron donor butyrate availability may not alleviate the problem of incomplete dechlorination therefore a more moderate electron donor addition is preferable and is expected to lead to complete dechlorination furthermore butyrate disappeared rapidly without the corresponding electron consumption or acetate production in batch experiments conducted with medium and excess electron donor addition in order to evaluate the high electron donor consumption observed during the first days of batch experiments the distribution of electron donor usage among different electron accepting processes was calculated table 5 presents the results of these calculations for the first day of the electron donor batch experiments in all experiments containing high butyrate concentrations butyrate consumption was higher than electron consumption thus recovery σ acceptors σ donors was as low as 6 in s400 b9 1 microscopic examinations see fig a 5 showed that in all experiments conducted with excess butyrate poly hydroxybutyrate phb inclusions were identified the presence of neisser positive granules was greater in zero sulfate experiment while fewer were noted in the experiments with sulfate hence part of the butyrate consumption observed at the start of batch experiments was not due to oxidation and is attributed to intracellular storage by microorganisms forming phb inclusions similar results have been reported by heavner et al 2013 who observed that butyrate depletion did not result in an increase of reduction products but was due to butyrate storage as phbs by syntrophomonas spp 4 conclusions the aim of this study was to examine the effect of sulfate concentration on reductive dechlorination and to evaluate if electron donor increase can improve the dechlorination rate to the existing literature this study added quantitative evidence for a series of metrics of dechlorination for combinations of sulfate and electron donor concentrations the results from the experiments could be summarized into the following conclusions the results verified that under the low electron donor conditions encountered in natural attenuation scenarios reductive dechlorination is not complete in sulfate rich aquifers complete dechlorination is possible even at elevated initial sulfate concentrations of up to 400 mg l provided ample time and electron donor however sulfate concentration can adversely affect the rate of biotransformation of cdce and especially vc the above findings can be quantified through the days needed for 99 of vc to be reduced to ethene since 5 83 171 and 366 days were required in experiments with zero 70 mg l 150 mg l and 400 mg l respectively in addition average 1st order vc dechlorination rates decreased with increasing sulfate concentration from 3 14 day 1 in cultures exposed to zero initial sulfate concentration to 0 07 day 1 0 03 day 1 and 0 01 day 1 in cultures exposed to 70 mg l 150 mg l and 400 mg l initial sulfate concentration respectively supplying electron donor in excess does not result in a faster complete dechlorination confirming the importance of the slow donor release substances used in laboratory experiments and the field moreover it was observed that chloroethenes removal rates slightly decreased at high electron donor doses acknowledgements this research was partially supported by a 4 year scholarship granted to kornilia antoniou by the department of water resources and environmental engineering of

1561,the effect of sulfate presence on reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes has been a matter of conflict among the limited reports found in literature this paper aims to clarify the misconceptions regarding the performance of trichloroethene biotransformation under sulfate reducing conditions by evaluating the effect of different sulfate concentrations on reductive dechlorination and to assess the influence of electron donor dose on dechlorination rate to this end batch experiments containing different sulfate and butyrate concentrations were conducted using trichloroethene dechlorinating and sulfate reducing parent cultures results demonstrated that if sufficient time and electron donor is provided complete dechlorination can be achieved even at up to 400 mg l initial sulfate concentration however the rate of dichloroethene and vinyl chloride degradation is reduced as sulfide concentration increases moreover the excess electron donor dose induced a slightly slower dechlorination rate the findings of this paper present an explanatory framework for the dechlorination of tce under sulfate reducing conditions and can contribute to the state of art bioremediation of contaminated sites keywords trichloroethene tce sulfate reduction dechlorination sulfide inhibition 1 introduction trichloroethylene tce a known human carcinogen usepa 2011 is widely used by the military as well as the commercial and industrial sectors as a degreasing solvent jin et al 2008 moran et al 2007 significant usage along with improper disposal practices have led to a widespread groundwater contamination worldwide who 2011 huang et al 2014 one major pathway for tce removal is biologically mediated reductive dechlorination a sequential electron transfer process where a chlorine atom is replaced by hydrogen under anaerobic conditions majone et al 2015 hence tce is converted to less chlorinated compounds such as dichloroethylene isomers mainly to cis dce and secondarily to trans dce and 1 1 dce vinyl chloride vc and eventually ethene eth löffler and edwards 2006 various bacteria species have the ability to metabolize chloroethenes jugder et al 2015 saiyari et al 2018 however only dehalococcoides mccartyi can achieve a complete transformation of tce to ethene by using solely hydrogen as the electron source löffler et al 2013 typically a mixed community that achieves complete or partial reductive dechlorination consists of a variety of microorganisms that carry out many other processes table a 1 reviews the microbial content of mixed cultures and contaminated sites that is presented in the literature in brief it is observed that either dehalococcoides spp or fermentative microorganisms such as synergistetes and bacteroidetes are predominant in dechlorinating communities other groups often detected are the following a microorganisms that cause partial dechlorination like geobacter spp and sulfurospirillum spp b the methanogenic archaea methanosarcinales and methanomicrobiales c acetogens such as spirochaetes phylum acetobacterium and sporomusa genus and d proteobacteria phylum especially gamma and delta proteobacteria that contains nitrate sulfate and iron reducing bacteria hence under anaerobic conditions several types of organic substrates can be oxidized by fermentative microorganisms to provide hydrogen and acetate hug et al 2012 dechlorinators are competing for electron donor with methanogens homoacetogens sulfate reducers and iron reducing bacteria adrian and löffler 2016 see table a 2 for half reactions and gibbs free energy thus the competition for molecular hydrogen is an important key factor for chloroethene removal efficiency badin et al 2016 previous studies found that reductive dechlorination is more thermodynamically favorable than methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis under hydrogen limiting conditions smatlak et al 1996 ballapragada et al 1997 fennell et al 1997 also observed that the addition of slowly degrading organic substrates like butyrate or propionate can lead to dechlorinators prevalence over methanogens due to their higher affinity for hydrogen see table a 3 for hydrogen threshold concentration of each process however the effect of sulfate reduction on dechlorination has been less studied and the available results are often inconsistent and contradictory chambon et al 2012 sulfate is ubiquitous in groundwater miao et al 2012 and is often reported in organohalide contaminated sites at concentrations up to 2880 mg l mao et al 2017 while the maximum permissible sulfate concentration above which reductive dechlorination is considered to be limited ranges in technical protocols from 20 mg l wiedemeier et al 1998 to 500 mg l parsons corporation 2004 a review of twelve field case studies showed that chlorinated ethene biotransformation can be successful even at elevated sulfate concentrations provided sufficient donor and time as well as a dense population of dehalococcoides mccartyi are available therefore the presence of sulfate seems to adversely affect the biotransformation rate rather than the completion of dechlorination pantazidou et al 2012 moreover the yield of chloroethene removal appears to vary also in laboratory studies ranging from ethene production hoelen and reinhard 2004 heimann et al 2005 aulenta et al 2008 to an incomplete dechlorination el mamouni et al 2002 boopathy and peters 2001 révész et al 2006 sung 2005 table 1 shows the results of reductive dechlorination performance in the presence of sulfate from experiments published in the last decade 2008 2018 the screening criteria for the studies presented herein were the following a experiments had to be under sulfate reducing or thermodynamically less favorable conditions and b microcosms should be soil free to avoid high iron content table 1 indicates that as sulfate concentration increases the progress of dechlorination is delayed but the degree of effectiveness seems to differ depending on the composition of the culture particularly experiments conducted by aulenta et al 2008 showed a slower ethene production at 360 mg l 3 75 mm sulfate compared to zero sulfate microcosms however the microbial community was not acclimated to elevated sulfate concentrations so only 60 of sulfate was depleted to sulfide on the contrary in mixtures of dehalococcoides sp and desulfovibrio sp pure cultures a rise of sulfate concentration from 192 mg l 2 mm to 480 mg l 5 mm caused the accumulation of tce and the complete depletion of sulfate mao et al 2017 in addition to the competition for the electron donor sulfide concentration has an inhibitory effect on reductive dechlorination hoelen and reinhard 2004 in experiments with 2 mm sulfide in liquid the accumulation of cis dce was observed while at lower concentrations pce was converted to ethene complete inhibition occurred when hydrogen sulfide aqueous concentration reached 5 mm sung 2005 nonetheless acclimatized cultures showed that the reductive dechlorination efficiency was similar under methanogenic condition and at 3 4 mm sulfide panagiotakis 2010 moreover sulfide toxicity could be specific to certain dechlorinating species since no inhibition was observed at a sulfidogenic site hoelen et al 2006 the conflicting findings complicate the interpretation of field and laboratory data and contribute to misconceptions regarding the competition mechanisms in mixed sulfate reducing and dechlorinating cultures the objectives of this study are a to evaluate the effect of sulfate reduction in the presence of various sulfate concentrations on reductive dechlorination b to investigate whether the increase of electron donor addition can speed up the dechlorination rate and c to examine the influence of excess electron donor dose on reductive processes to this end batch experiments containing four different sulfate concentrations were conducted 0 70 150 and 400 mg l with low 0 3 0 9 mm medium 2 2 3 mm and high 9 1 mm butyrate doses using trichloroethene dechlorinating and sulfate reducing parent cultures 2 materials and methods 2 1 parent culture development within the context of this study parent cultures were developed at various sulfate concentrations in order to provide biomass for the batch experiments that was exposed to selected sulfate concentrations that ranged from 0 to 400 mg l the enrichment of the cultures is described in detail in supplementary material and is illustrated in fig a 1 in brief all parent cultures were in duplicates with different initial sulfate concentration by adjusting on weekly basis the concentration of sulfate to four levels s0 0 mm zero sulfate s70 0 73 mm or 70 mg l s150 1 56 mm or 150 mg l and s400 4 16 mm or 400 mg l and were maintained for approximately 2 to 6 years all cultures were fed with basal medium tandoi et al 1994 vitamin solution balch et al 1979 yeast extract and selenium tungsten solution widdel 1988 at the same time 0 188 mmoles tce per bottle 0 5 mm or 65 7 mg l tce nominal concentration i e total amount added to the bottle divided by liquid volume and 0 113 mmoles butyrate per bottle 0 3 mm or 27 0 mg l which served as electron donor were added the quantity of the electron donor was adequate only for 40 of the required reducing equivalents for complete dechlorination of tce to ethene assuming conservatively that butyrate yields 4 eq mol without taking into account the presence of sulfate all parent cultures were acclimatized for a period of at least 300 days prior to providing biomass for the batch experiments at the end of each weekly cycle sulfate tce and butyrate were measured and the amount to be added was estimated to reach the default concentrations for the beginning of the next cycle also measurements of chlorinated ethenes ethene methane and volatile fatty acid vfas were carried out to evaluate the overall performance fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis was employed to investigate the composition of parent cultures and to identify the various groups of microorganisms that take part in the redox reactions 2 2 experimental procedures nine batch experiments were conducted in 160 ml serum bottles with a headspace gas to liquid ratio 6 10 thus containing 100 ml of liquid volume a 15 of the liquid volume was basal medium selenium tungsten solution and vitamin solution bottles were flushed with n2 co2 70 30 sealed with teflon rubber stopper and aluminum crimp caps to maintain anaerobic conditions batch experiments were kept at 25 c with magnetic stirring in the dark as in parent cultures the initial trichloroethene nominal concentration was 0 5 mm 65 7 mg l or 0 05 mmoles bottle in all batch tests the initial butyrate and sulfate concentrations for each duplicate pair are shown in table 2 which groups the batch tests in three sets according to the type of question under study concerning i the effect of low electron donor quantities on reductive dechlorination under sulfate reducing conditions ii the effect of a moderate but adequate electron donor quantity on reductive dechlorination under different sulfate concentrations and iii the effect of adding electron donor in excess of dechlorination and sulfate reduction requirements all batch experiments were conducted in duplicates all values reported in tables and figures are mean values of the duplicates accompanied by standard deviation as shown in table 2 five different butyrate doses were selected that ranged from 0 3 mm to 9 1 mm in order to evaluate the effect of sulfate concentrations on dechlorination under limiting and non limiting electron donor conditions as already mentioned batch experiments conducted with the addition of a low dose of 0 3 mm butyrate provided only 40 of the required reducing equivalents for complete dechlorination of tce to ethene assuming that butyrate yields 4 eq mol under these conditions once the electron donor i e butyrate is fully depleted the electron acceptor i e sulfate is expected to remain since it has been supplied in larger amounts than can be reduced by the donor provided in this way a highly competitive environment is established which is the anticipated regime for natural attenuation scenarios on the other hand batch experiments conducted with the addition of 2 2 mm and 9 1 mm butyrate provided adequate electron donor for complete dechlorination and sulfate reduction with initial sulfate concentrations of 70 mg l and 400 mg l respectively therefore these experiments simulate remediation by biostimulation in sulfate rich aquifers contaminated by chlorinated ethenes 2 3 materials for the purpose of this study the following chemicals were

linde 2 4 analytical procedures and program two headspace samples 50 μl each were obtained approximately every day on the first week and periodically afterwards for the analysis of ethene and methane in one sample and chlorinated ethenes ces in the other sample for the quantification of the above a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and a plot column gs gaspro 30 m 0 32 mm diameter j w folsom ca was used two isothermal methods were employed at 160 c for the measurement of chlorinated ethenes and at 50 c for methane and ethene while the injector was held at 220 c and the detector at 250 c in both cases standards were prepared by adding a known mass of each compound to 160 ml serum bottles with 100 ml deionized water resulting in 6 10 headspace to liquid ratio the same as the experiments results for chlorinated ethenes methane and ethene are expressed either as mass per bottle or as nominal concentrations i e total mass of compound in the bottle divided by liquid volume in the results section the aqueous concentrations of chloroethenes ethene and methane were calculated using henry law gossett 1987 as follows 1 c aqueous m total v l v h h r t where

quantification of volatile fatty acids 200 μl of liquid samples were obtained periodically then filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filter and stored at minus 20 c the samples were placed into 150 μl vials micro inserts and acidified with 2 v v hcl 2 n 0 5 μl of the pretreated liquid samples were injected in a gas chromatograph equipped with an autosampler a fused silica capillary column nukol 15

spectrophotometer at the end of the experiments the liquid of the batch tests was used for sulfide measurement and biomass determination 100 μl of liquid sample were withdrawn with a gas tight syringe for quantification of sulfide using method 690 of hach lange dr2800 spectrophotometer standards were prepared by injecting a known amount of sulfide to sealed 160 ml serum bottles with 100 ml deionized water as described above results of sulfide are also expressed as mass per bottle and as nominal concentration the sulfide content in aqueous solution was calculated according to eq 1 biomass content was determined as volatile suspended solids vss according to standard methods apha 2005 and as total protein lowry et al 1951 for protein analysis 1 ml liquid sample was stored at 20 c until the pretreatment with solubilization this was achieved by centrifuging the sample at 10000 rpm for 30 min extracting 500 μl of supernatant adding 400 μl naoh 0 1 n re centrifuging and then 550 μl of supernatant was placed in a 1 5 ml tube with 250 μl hcl 0 1 n standards were prepared with a known concentration of bovine serum albumin deionized water and 3 57 mm nahco3 same as batch experiments the repeatability was 16 1 and 11 3 for vss and total protein respectively 2 5 metrics alternative metrics can serve as tools for the quantification of dechlorination efficiency and comparison purposes an aggregate measure mole fraction of chloroethenes ncl was used to describe the rate of each step of dechlorination according to the following equation 2 n cl dces 2 vc 3 eth tce dces vc eth thus ncl tracks the formulation stages of the desired final product ethene by taking values from 0 no ethene production to 3 complete transformation to ethene heimann et al 2005 the selected metrics which focus on reductive dechlorination are shown in table a 5 2 6 electron balance calculations electron distribution percent among anaerobic dechlorination methanogenesis and sulfate reduction was calculated according to the following molar equivalent factors 2 eq mol for each cl released i e for each step of the sequential dechlorination 8 eq mol methane produced and 8 eq mol sulfate reduced assuming that sulfide is the end product of sulfate reduction aulenta et al 2008 likewise electron donor consumption was calculated according to 4 eq mol butyrate used 1 mol of butyrate yields 2 mol of acetate and 2 mol of h2 8 eq mol acetate used 1 mol of acetate yields 2 mol of co2 and 4 mol of h2 and 20 eq mol for dead biomass yielding h2 assuming that 1 g vss is equivalent to 1 g c5h7o2n adamson and newell 2009 sleep et al 2005 in order to eliminate precision errors in batch experiments the electron balance recovery was calculated as follows and the permissible range of values was between 75 125 3 electron balance total electron usage meq l total electron donor meq l 2 7 biomass characterization occasionally samples were taken from s0 s150 and s400 to identify the different groups of microorganisms that coexist in parent cultures fish was employed according to the procedure described elsewhere mamais et al 2016 panousi et al 2016 the probes that were used alongside with formamide and nacl concentrations are shown in table a 6 in table a 7 results are expressed as a fraction of the specific binding of hybridized cells out of the total dapi cells probe dapi in addition three batch tests in duplicate were conducted to investigate the disappearance of butyrate in the first days of the experiments hence one day long ancillary experiments with three initial concentrations of sulfate 0 150 400 mg l were carried out according to the protocol described above see experimental procedures initial butyrate was 9 1 mm in all bottles a control test was also conducted using the s400 parent culture but butyrate was not added therefore the electron donor concentration was minimal after one day of operation samples were withdrawn for the measurement of chloroethenes ethene methane volatile fatty acids sulfate and biomass moreover microscopic examinations for the characterization of biomass were performed according to eikelboom and van buijsen 1981 and jenkins et al 1993 the neisser staining procedure was employed for the identification of poly hydroxybutyrate phb inclusions in the microorganisms all microscopic observations were performed at 1000 magnifications by using a phase contrast microscope nikon eclipse 80 3 results discussion 3 1 parent culture performance τhe long term performance of parent cultures in terms of weekly values is presented in table a 7 mean values of cis dichloroethene cdce vinyl chloride vc ethene eth methane mth remaining sulfate and acetate ac with standard deviations for each duplicate pair of the parent cultures are shown along with days of operation on the 1st day trichloroethene tce as well as butyrate but were depleted in all duplicate pairs as shown in fig a 2 until day 7 most of tce transformed to vc since 84 93 91 and 89 of total chloroethenes accumulated as vc in s0 s70 s150 and s400 respectively furthermore molecular analysis of parent cultures showed that dehalococcoides spp thrives even in the presence of sulfate as already observed in literature panagiotakis et al 2014 compared to other dechlorinating communities found in the literature table a 1 the cultures used herein have a typical microbial composition containing mainly organohalide respiring bacteria acetogens methanogenic archaea and deltaproteobacteria acetate was mostly depleted in s70 s150 and s400 but occasionally a small amount accumulated especially in s0 acetate concentrations were unstable in the approximately 1600 days of operation resulting in an inconsistent methane production regarding electron donor competition sulfate reduction was similar in s70 s150 and s400 despite the different initial concentration methanogenesis appears to be inhibited by sulfate reduction since methane was produced only in zero sulfate cultures similar results have also been observed by aulenta et al 2008 where about 23 and 0 2 of the original electron donor was used for methanogenesis at zero and 3 75 mm sulfate concentration respectively this trend is reinforced by fish results since the methanogenic archaea percentage is lower under sulfate reducing conditions ranging from to 4 to 10 likewise sulfate concentration seems to affect acetogens too considering that acetobacterium spp population was 39 and 20 of total dapi cells in s0 and s400 respectively on the contrary deltaproteobacteria seems to increase in s150 and s400 cultures mainly due to higher population of sulfate reducing bacteria the above finding may be caused by sulfide toxicity because methanogens are sensitive to hydrogen sulfide exposure scherr et al 2011 it could also be due to the competition for the electron donor since the sulfate reducing microorganisms maintain the level of hydrogen below the threshold for methanogenic archaea and homoacetogens yang and mccarty 1998 see table a 3 3 2 effect of sulfate concentrations on reductive dechlorination under low electron donor conditions the aim of these experiments was to investigate the effect of sulfate on reductive dechlorination under limiting electron donor conditions to this end the s150 parent culture was used as biomass for the batch experiments that are presented in table 2 containing low donor doses of 26 4 mg l 0 3 mm and 80 0 mg l 0 9 the added quantities of butyrate were adequate only for 40 and 121 of the required reducing equivalents for biotransformation of tce to ethene figs a 3 and a 4 illustrate a chlorinated ethenes ethene methane sulfate nominal concentrations and b vfas concentrations in s150 b0 3 and s150 b0 9 experiments respectively results demonstrate that tce disappeared on day 1 while cdce transformed after 12 days in s150 b0 3 and after 4 days in s150 b0 9 however complete dechlorination was not achieved as 0 041 mmoles bottle 82 of the tce initially added and 0 030 mmoles bottle vc 60 of the tce initially added remained at 181 days of operation in experiments with 0 3 mm and 0 9 mm butyrate respectively sulfate was reduced by 55 in s150 b0 3 experiment and methane was not detected but when the donor quantity tripled all sulfate converted to sulfide and a small quantity of methane was produced reaching up to 0 066 mmoles bottle butyrate and acetate were depleted in both experiments with low electron doses and endogenous decay provided the electrons needed yielding 27 2 and 12 5 of total electron equivalents produced according the vss content mcguire et al 2006 and sleep et al 2005 also noticed that reductive dechlorination will continue even years after electron donor consumption at a slow stable rate due to dead biomass oxidation thus 0 3 mm and 0 9 mm of butyrate were inadequate quantities for reductive processes and can cause a delay in chlorinated ethenes removal therefore under low electron donor conditions encountered in natural attenuation scenarios reductive dechlorination is expected to stall in sulfate rich aquifers 3 3 effect of sulfate concentrations on reductive dechlorination under medium electron donor conditions the aim of these experiments was to investigate whether the increase of electron donor addition can speed up the dechlorination rate and alleviate the negative effect of sulfates on dechlorination expected in sulfate rich contaminated aquifers batch experiments were conducted employing parent cultures s0 s70 s150 and s400 that were fed on a weekly basis with 0 70 mg l 150 mg l and 400 mg l sulfate respectively additionally all parent cultures received weekly 65 7 mg l tce nominal concentration and 27 0 mg l butyrate as shown in table 2 each batch experiment presented herein illustrates the long term performance of each culture when exposed to similar initial conditions as in parent cultures with respect to tce and sulfate but at medium butyrate doses of 194 mg l 2 2 mm or 264 mg l 3 0 mm compared to the parent cultures the batch experiments were conducted at a much higher electron donor availability in order to evaluate whether the supplementary donor addition is able to reduce the dechlorination lag obtained in the presence of different sulfate concentrations adopting the conservative assumption that butyrate yields 4 eq mol the amount of butyrate added provided adequate electron donor for 100 dechlorination and sulfate reduction with initial sulfate concentrations of 70 mg l for the batch experiments conducted at higher sulfate concentrations the amount of electron donor provided was ample for dechlorination but not sufficient for both chloroethene and sulfate reduction figs 1 to 4 demonstrate the reductive dechlorination methanogenesis sulfate reduction and vfas oxidation during the operation of s0 b3 0 s70 b2 2 s150 b3 0 s400 b3 0 experiments the results show that in all batch experiments complete dechlorination was achieved but increasing sulfate concentration requires extended time of operation since dechlorination rates decrease even at the elevated sulfate concentration of 400 mg l vc concentration gradually decreased to nearly zero after 250 days of operation consequently complete dechlorination can be achieved this result is consistent with hoelen and reinhard 2004 where complete dechlorination of tetrachloroethene pce was observed after 1000 days with 240 mg l sulfate according to the results of the batch experiments tce was consumed in the first day of operation regardless of the initial sulfate concentration on the other hand cdce was depleted in 1 5 days in zero sulfate experiments and in 5 6 days in bottles with sulfate addition about 1 of the initial tce remained as vc after 5 83 171 and 366 days in experiments with zero s0 b3 0 fig 1 0 7 mm s70 b2 2 fig 2 1 6 mm s150 b3 0 fig 3 and 4 2 mm s400 b3 0 fig 4 initial sulfate concentrations respectively as it is shown in table 3 and fig 5 the dechlorination step affected by initial sulfate concentration increase is the reductive limiting step of vc transformation as sulfate increases the rate of vc reduction is decreasing affecting the period needed for complete dechlorination specifically average 1st order vc dechlorination rates decreased with increasing sulfate concentration from 3 14 day 1 in cultures exposed to zero initial sulfate concentration to 0 07 day 1 0 03 day 1 and 0 01 day 1 in cultures exposed to 70 mg l 150 mg l and 400 mg l initial sulfate concentration respectively as shown in figs 2a 3a and 4a sulfate is rapidly consumed at the elevated sulfate concentration of 400 mg l towards the end of the experiment sulfide mass reached up to 0 36 mmoles bottle 3 6 mm or 123 mg l sulfide nominal concentration indicating that approximately 87 of sulfate was transformed to sulfide hence the dechlorination results illustrate that complete dechlorination can be achieved under sulfide nominal concentrations up to 123 mg l 2 9 mm or 99 mg l concentration in liquid but at a much lower rate supporting the general belief found in the literature that sulfide can cause inhibition of dechlorination sung 2005 he et al 2005 mao et al 2017 hoelen and reinhard 2004 moreover as table a 2 shows sulfate reduction occurs by sulfate reducing microorganisms that use either butyrate to produce acetate and sulfide or acetate and hydrogen produced by syntrophic butyrate oxidizing bacteria the latter butyrate oxidation is feasible in the presence of an active hydrogenotrophic bacteria that renders the reaction thermodynamically stable panagiotakis et al 2014 in all experiments sulfate was degraded within a period of 30 days consuming a high percentage of butyrate and the remaining acetate was the only source of electrons for the depletion of vc however previous studies have shown that acetate is not a desirable donor to use for anaerobic dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes wen et al 2015 lee et al 2007 methanogenesis was not observed in the presence of sulfate only when sulfate was completely reduced methane production commenced within a period of 50 150 days figs 2a 3a and 4a the delay of methane production shows that sulfate reducers outcompete methanogens for electron equivalents differences between starting days of methane production were observed between duplicate experiments too causing high deviations at the measurements of volatile fatty acids and methane at the end of s70 b2 2 and s150 b3 0 experiments sulfate concentration was 0 02 mm 2 mg l in both cases while sulfide was 1 4 mm or 46 mg l in liquid 1 69 mm or 54 mg l nominal concentration in s150 b3 not measured in s70 b2 2 in all experiments except s0 b3 0 butyrate was depleted in the first days of the experiments producing acetate acetate stabilized for a period of time in s70 b2 2 and s150 b3 0 batch experiments since butyrate alone could provide the total electron equivalents for sulfate reduction and the electrons derived from acetate were used mainly for methanogenesis so methanogenesis was the predominant electron accepting process in all bottles utilizing 50 75 of the total electron equivalents used reductive dechlorination used only 41 2 9 0 7 2 and 5 1 of the total electron equivalents in s0 b3 0 s70 b2 2 s150 b3 0 and s400 b3 0 respectively 3 4 effect of excess electron donor addition on reductive dechlorination in view of the positive effect of electron donor addition on reductive dechlorination a second set of batch experiments was conducted in order to evaluate dechlorination efficiency in the presence of excess electron donor three more experiments were conducted with increased butyrate concentration up to 9 1 mm 800 mg l with zero s0 b9 1 1 6 mm s150 b9 1 and 4 2 mm s400 b9 1 sulfate concentrations figs 6 7 and 8 illustrate the a reductive dechlorination methanogenesis and sulfate reduction b butyrate propionate isobutyrate and acetate oxidation throughout the duration of experiments s0 b9 1 s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 respectively as shown in the figures complete dechlorination was only achieved in the zero sulfate experiment s0 b9 1 on the 5th day of operation in the other two experiments although ethene was formed a quantity of vc remained until the end of operation approximately 20 vc remained of total chlorinated ethene concentration in s150 b9 1 and 8 in s400 b9 1 moreover tce reduction rate decreased with electron donor addition it was observed that the tce zero order reduction rate was 0 104 mmoles day 0 099 mmoles day 0 046 mmoles day and 0 026 mmoles day at s150 b0 3 s150 b0 9 s150 b3 0 and s150 b9 1 experiments respectively a similar trend was noted in zero sulfate experiments where the velocity of tce removal was 0 140 mmoles day in 3 0 mm and 0 086 mmoles day in 9 1 mm butyrate el mamouni et al 2002 also observed that increasing electron donor concentration hinders chloroethenes removal efficiency the tce removal rates obtained with excess electron donor may have been influenced by the slightly lower ph values measured in bottles with excess electron donor compared to medium butyrate doses ph was in the 6 55 6 78 range specifically ph was 6 28 0 03 6 35 0 05 and 6 34 0 06 in s0 b9 1 s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 respectively in batch experiments conducted with excess donor addition sulfate reduction was complete similarly to the intermediate butyrate concentration producing 0 18 mmoles bottle 1 5 mm concentration in liquid and 0 36 mmoles bottle 2 9 mm concentratin in liquid sulfide in s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 experiments respectively however methanogenesis was observed only in s0 b9 1 experiment in s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 even after sulfate reduction methane concentration remained very low approximately 0 002 0 004 mmoles bottle it is anticipated that high acetate levels approximately 6 6 mm and 12 7 mm at the end of s150 b9 1 and s400 b9 1 experiments respectively inhibited methane production in all experiments butyrate was not depleted but the concentration decreased as the total sulfate reduction increased the produced acetate remained constant throughout the duration of the experiments for comparison purposes values extracted from batch experiments with medium butyrate concentration 3 mm are repeated in table 4 and fig 9 results show that high butyrate levels do not enhance dechlorination performance and in some cases have a negative effect on dechlorination although sulfate reducing bacteria srb are competing with dechlorinating bacteria significantly increasing electron donor butyrate availability may not alleviate the problem of incomplete dechlorination therefore a more moderate electron donor addition is preferable and is expected to lead to complete dechlorination furthermore butyrate disappeared rapidly without the corresponding electron consumption or acetate production in batch experiments conducted with medium and excess electron donor addition in order to evaluate the high electron donor consumption observed during the first days of batch experiments the distribution of electron donor usage among different electron accepting processes was calculated table 5 presents the results of these calculations for the first day of the electron donor batch experiments in all experiments containing high butyrate concentrations butyrate consumption was higher than electron consumption thus recovery σ acceptors σ donors was as low as 6 in s400 b9 1 microscopic examinations see fig a 5 showed that in all experiments conducted with excess butyrate poly hydroxybutyrate phb inclusions were identified the presence of neisser positive granules was greater in zero sulfate experiment while fewer were noted in the experiments with sulfate hence part of the butyrate consumption observed at the start of batch experiments was not due to oxidation and is attributed to intracellular storage by microorganisms forming phb inclusions similar results have been reported by heavner et al 2013 who observed that butyrate depletion did not result in an increase of reduction products but was due to butyrate storage as phbs by syntrophomonas spp 4 conclusions the aim of this study was to examine the effect of sulfate concentration on reductive dechlorination and to evaluate if electron donor increase can improve the dechlorination rate to the existing literature this study added quantitative evidence for a series of metrics of dechlorination for combinations of sulfate and electron donor concentrations the results from the experiments could be summarized into the following conclusions the results verified that under the low electron donor conditions encountered in natural attenuation scenarios reductive dechlorination is not complete in sulfate rich aquifers complete dechlorination is possible even at elevated initial sulfate concentrations of up to 400 mg l provided ample time and electron donor however sulfate concentration can adversely affect the rate of biotransformation of cdce and especially vc the above findings can be quantified through the days needed for 99 of vc to be reduced to ethene since 5 83 171 and 366 days were required in experiments with zero 70 mg l 150 mg l and 400 mg l respectively in addition average 1st order vc dechlorination rates decreased with increasing sulfate concentration from 3 14 day 1 in cultures exposed to zero initial sulfate concentration to 0 07 day 1 0 03 day 1 and 0 01 day 1 in cultures exposed to 70 mg l 150 mg l and 400 mg l initial sulfate concentration respectively supplying electron donor in excess does not result in a faster complete dechlorination confirming the importance of the slow donor release substances used in laboratory experiments and the field moreover it was observed that chloroethenes removal rates slightly decreased at high electron donor doses acknowledgements this research was partially supported by a 4 year scholarship granted to kornilia antoniou by the department of water resources and environmental engineering of

1562,nitrate in drinking water may cause serious health problems for consumers agricultural activities are known to be the main source of groundwater nitrate contaminating rural domestic and urban public water supply wells in farming regions management practices have been proposed to reduce the amount of nitrate in groundwater including improved nutrient management practices and pump and fertilize with nitrate affected irrigation wells here we evaluate the feasibility and long term impacts of agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar in the source area of public water supply wells a numerical model of nitrate fate and transport was developed for the modesto basin part of california s central valley aquifer system the basin is representative of semi arid agricultural regions around the world with a diversity of crop types overlying an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system a local public supply well in an economically disadvantaged community surrounded by farmland was the focus of this study model scenarios implemented include business as usual alternative low impact crops and ag mar in the source area of the public supply well alternative nutrient management and recharge practices act as remediation tools in the area between farmland and the public supply well improved agricultural source area management practices are shown to be an effective tool to maintain or even enhance groundwater quality in the targeted supply well while remediating ambient groundwater best results are obtained when lowering nitrate load while also increasing recharge in the source area simultaneously this scenario reduced nitrate in the supply well s drinking water by 80 relative to the business as usual scenario it also remediated ambient groundwater used by domestic wells between the source area farmlands and the supply well and showed 60 more reduction of nitrate after 60 years of application increasing recharge led to shorter initial response time five years and showed the most sustainable impact our analysis further suggests that ag mar in a highly discontinuous wide spread pattern leads to slow water quality response and may not yield sufficient water quality improvements keywords groundwater quality nitrate pollution agricultural management practices contributing recharge area crop change groundwater remediation 1 introduction groundwater is a critical resource for drinking water and irrigation in the central valley california a region dominated by intensive cultivation of mostly specialty crops burow et al 2008 nitrate is one of the most widespread groundwater contaminants threatening drinking water supplies here and in agricultural regions elsewhere nolan et al 2002 van grinsven et al 2015 wang et al 2016 nitrate causes serious health problems if it exceeds 10 mg n l in drinking water jordan and weller 1996 nitrate transport through groundwater into connected surface water may also significantly affect surface water quality and ecosystem functioning sprague et al 2011 tesoriero et al 2013 nitrate in groundwater is a global problem the european union eu has undertaken broad steps toward managerial regulations that prevent further nitrate pollution of their aquifers hansen et al 2017 the issue is most threatening in some where drinking water suppliers entirely rely on groundwater resources such as denmark gejl et al 2019 studies conducted throughout the eu but also in china and elsewhere have repeatedly identified the historical nitrate loading from cropland as the main contributor to groundwater nitrate pollution in these areas gu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 zhang and hiscock 2016 harter et al 2017 ransom et al 2017 in the subsurface nitrate is the most readily transported form of reactive nitrogen jury and nielson 1989 lacking significant sorption or degradation potential unless reducing geochemical conditions prevail sources include farmland animal agriculture septic systems and naturally occurring nitrate liu et al 2014 irrigated croplands managed with synthetic nitrogen fertilizers or animal manure have been shown to be the largest source of nitrate loading in agricultural areas burow et al 2008 harter et al 2017 the main driver of long term average nitrate leaching from croplands is the balance between nitrogen inputs atmospheric deposition synthetic fertilizer animal manure and nitrogen harvested kirchmann et al 2002 this excess nitrogen is lost in ionic or gaseous form through leaching runoff volatilization and denitrification liu et al 2014 once leached below the root zone denitrification through microbial processes may provide for some or complete natural attenuation of nitrate depending on biogeochemical conditions ransom et al 2017 these conditions also affect the vulnerability of drinking supply wells to nitrate contamination eberts et al 2013 excess nitrogen is transported as nitrate to groundwater via soil percolation and recharge in some instances dry wells abandoned wells or improperly destroyed wells may also act as rapid conduits of nitrate contaminated surface runoff directly into groundwater gailey 2017 in irrigated regions minimizing recharge during the growing season and matching nitrogen applications to crop demand is the primary tool to nitrate source control rosenstock et al 2014 baram et al 2016 and to protect vulnerable public supply wells from nitrate contamination eberts et al 2013 land use change agricultural practice improvements or technological advancements have been shown to help to reduce nitrate contributions to groundwater these techniques a control water application rates to minimize nitrate leaching and b reduce nitrogen quantity applied to the land dzurella et al 2012 lee et al 2017 somura et al 2008 suggested reducing the concentration of nitrate leaching to groundwater by partly or entirely removing livestock area hiscock et al 2007 and zhang and hiscock 2016 showed that land use conversion to forest provides a considerable decrease in groundwater nitrate concentrations in the sherwood sandstone and lincolnshire limestone aquifers in england they used modflow and mt3dms as simulation tools to study different land use scenarios that included partial or complete conversion between arable areas woodlands forest and grasslands they indicated that water quality change of public supply wells is on the order of years to centuries when land use changes occur over days to decades moreover rudolph et al 2015 conducted field experiments to study the performance of regional scale nutrient management practices in the source area of supply wells neither of these studies considered changes to alternative crop types or agricultural managed aquifer recharge the groundwater age mixture in a public supply well is also an important factor on water quality dynamics in the well eberts et al 2013 the travel time distribution from source area to wells is partly due to the complexity of media short circuit pathways in the flow system create a large fraction of young water in the well and provide for faster response to land use change mcmahon et al 2008 the vertical length of the well screen is typically an even more significant contributor than aquifer heterogeneity to wide distribution of travel times within the water exiting a well at any given time henri and harter 2019 travel times of nitrate in the unsaturated zone range from less than one year to decades depending mostly on depth to groundwater and on recharge rates under agricultural activities below the water table nitrate travel times to shallow domestic wells range from a few years to several decades and from one to several decades and even centuries for deeper production wells jurgens et al 2008 van der schans et al 2009 it has recently also been suggested that farmland provides an untapped resource for recharge of seasonal flood and excess water when available during the non growing season niswonger et al 2017 department of water resources 2018 this promising technique is known as agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar ghasemizade et al 2019 key considerations for implementation of ag mar include strong coordination between growers and water managers and selection of farms with suitable crop and soil characteristics while primary consideration of ag mar is for aquifer replenishment we here consider its potential to significantly improve groundwater quality the implementation of water and nutrient management to improve groundwater nitrate conditions may incur significant cost on agriculture medellín azuara et al 2012 mayzelle et al 2015 considered the economic feasibility and cost of the more drastic measure of converting irrigated agricultural land uses surrounding economically disadvantaged communities dac in the tulare lake basin to reduce the risk of nitrate contamination in their public supply wells the source area of all drinking water wells inside dcs was assumed to be a circular region called the protective agricultural buffer zone these buffer zones were devoted to clean recharge basins and conversion of land use to leguminous n fixing crops such as alfalfa or low nitrogen use crops such as vineyards surprisingly the work demonstrated economic gains over 20 years offset some or all the cost of land use conversion for some scenarios in addition it minimizes the cost of drinking water treatment plants operation and maintenance which is important for communities facing financial constraint source area agricultural practices play an important role in determining the water quality in targeted drinking water wells these activities change a the volume of water that enters the groundwater system and b the management of water and nutrients on crops to reduce nitrate mass transported to groundwater we develop a high resolution transient regional flow and transport model to more closely investigate the effects of agricultural practices on future nitrate concentration dynamics in public supply wells and on the quality of groundwater in nearby domestic wells specifically we seek to quantify the effectiveness of a agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar during the rainy winter season and b nitrate load reduction by either growing appropriate alternative crops or by significantly improving nutrient management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area of about 2700 km2 is located in the northeastern san joaquin valley bounded on the western edge by the san joaquin river on the northern edge near the stanislaus river in the south near the merced river and at the eastern edge by the bedrocks of the sierra nevada foothills fig 1 the san joaquin river drains the study area into the san francisco bay pacific ocean the land surface in the study area slopes westward from the sierra nevada foothills to the san joaquin river gradients range from 1 m km near the river to 5 m km in places near the foothills and adjacent to streams and rivers the climate is semi arid characterized by hot summers and mild winters the rainfall averaged 315 mm annually from 1931 to 1997 with most precipitation occurring from late fall through early spring the headwaters of san joaquin river and its tributaries the stanislaus tuolumne and merced rivers originate from the sierra nevada mountains to the north and east of the study area and provide an important source of irrigation water managed through upstream reservoirs phillips et al 2007a agriculture is the major land use covering about 65 of the study area the primary crops are deciduous trees almonds and walnuts peaches grapes and forage crops grain corn pasture and alfalfa in 2010 the cities of modesto and turlock and a number of smaller communities occupy about 7 of the study area the remaining land areas are predominantly dry land vegetation near the foothills and riparian wetlands along river corridors phillips et al 2015 the aquifer system consists of highly heterogeneous alluvial sediments the aquifer is mainly unconfined within the study area although discontinuous fine grained units locally confine sand and gravel layers fig 2 the corcoran clay a semi permeable barrier is a key hydrogeological feature that limits vertical groundwater flow in the western part of the study area the top of the corcoran clay zone is in the range of 25 to 80 m below land surface the confining unit has a maximum thickness of about 58 m the confined aquifer below the corcoran clay is also an important regional water resource phillips et al 2015 prior to groundwater development in the early 1900s streams recharged groundwater predominantly near the mountain front to the northeast of the study area groundwater moved laterally across the basin and discharged at the san joaquin river subsequently groundwater pumping and diversion of water from streams for irrigation added a vertical flow pattern to the groundwater system irrigation water provided significant additional groundwater recharge to the system while irrigation pumpage became the main groundwater discharge from the system burow et al 2008 nitrate is one of the main groundwater contaminants in the study area derived mainly from the application of agricultural nitrogen based fertilizers harter et al 2017 elevated nitrate concentrations in the region are mostly associated with young groundwater in the shallow groundwater system bexfield and jurgens 2014 2 2 flow and transport model development 2 2 1 groundwater flow simulation a calibrated transient three dimensional saturated flow model constructed in modflow owhm phillips et al 2015 was modified to develop simulation conditions for a prediction period from january 2005 to december 2064 the original model represents groundwater flow in the study region from january 1960 to december 2004 with 540 stress periods of one month each the model uses the farm process schmid and hanson 2009 which allocates available surface water to water users and simulates processes associated with agricultural water management recharge groundwater pumping surface water interaction with groundwater and crop parameters to set boundary conditions for solving the groundwater flow equation the model domain covers a total area of 3353 76 km2 using a grid discretized horizontally into 400 m 400 m cells in 153 rows 137 columns and 16 layers layer thickness generally increases with depth ranging from one to 28 m in the top layer total thickness of the model is about 220 to 430 m the corcoran clay layer thickness ranging from 3 to 43 m has been assigned to western cells in layer eight of the model general head dependent boundaries are employed to simulate lateral flow across the model boundaries except along the sierra nevada foothills northeastern boundary which is considered a no flow boundary phillips et al 2015 for the transient flow and transport model in this study we first needed to convert the modflow owhm model into a modflow 2005 framework to create a flow model platform that is compatible with an mt3d zheng 1990 based transport model this was achieved by deriving owhm specific flux boundary conditions from output files of the original model including recharge rates deep percolation of irrigation and precipitation evapotranspiration parameters and private agricultural pumpage location and time specific flux data were used to create suitable modflow 2005 packages to effectively impose the same boundary conditions on the flow model in the second step we modified boundary conditions to represent a cyclical steady state condition for 60 years the original model s year 2004 monthly recharge and pumping conditions were repeated for each of 60 years starting from january 2005 in 720 monthly stress periods fig 3 seasonal pumping and recharge cause significant periodic change in water levels in addition because the 2004 water budget was not entirely balanced water levels showed a long term decrease of about 3 4 cm year over the 60 year period fig 3 2 2 2 supply well selection the regional groundwater flow model was used to delineate the capture zone and the contributing recharge area for a single public supply well located in one of the economically disadvantaged communities dac in the study domain data related to the non farm wells in the well package of the original modflow owhm model were used to select an appropriate supply well for this study these data include spatial distribution of wells well depth and pumping rates only shallow public supply wells were considered for the purpose of this study the concentration of nitrate in groundwater samples from agricultural land use in the area is reported to be much higher in shallow groundwater and less in the deeper aquifer burow et al 2008 2010 in addition deep production wells are likely to receive water with a wide range of ages that increases the mixing of poor quality water with older cleaner water burow et al 2008 the selected well was among wells with longest possible screen interval above the confining layer where agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar practices may have most impact on groundwater quality the selected well is located in the city of ceres adjacent to agricultural lands it has a maximum and minimum pumping rates of 4900 and 1400 m3 d over the scenario period fig 3 2 2 3 recharge area delineation delineation of the production well s source area the area of recharge is a critical step in determining the spatial extent of the area within which to apply alternative agricultural practices that would reduce long term nitrate levels here we use the particle tracking program modpath pollock 2012 to simulate groundwater flow pathlines backwards from the public supply well to the recharge area and to estimate groundwater travel times the pathline particle tracking technique uses advective transport but does not consider dispersion or diffusion cell by cell groundwater flux and effective porosity interconnected pores are the main input information for the modpath program to track particles in time and space the effective porosity used in the current contaminant transport and particle tracking simulations was distributed based on the percentage of coarse grained texture in model cells table 1 the values for each category of porosity is derived from previous work in similar regions the well screen of the targeted public supply well is located along two vertically adjacent cells in the model in layers five and six the top of the screen is at a depth of 26 7 m below ground surface and the screen length is 13 9 m twenty particles were equally distributed at each side of the cells 200 particles in total and released from the well screen every two stress periods 360 release times this frequency of particle release takes the system s transient dynamics into account particles moved from the well screen to the water table backwards over the 60 year simulation time from where the public supply well s water originated twenty five cells were identified as the source area for the drinking water well land use in those cells includes urban and farm lands fig 4 2 2 4 nitrate transport model construction three dimensional transport of nitrate in saturated porous media was simulated using the advection dispersion equation and solved numerically by use of mt3d program zheng and bennett 2002 θc t θd c θvc q s c s where θ is porosity unitless c is the concentration of nitrate in groundwater m l3 v is the seepage velocity v q θ l t d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2 t c s is the concentration of the nitrate in source or sink m l3 and q s is the volumetric flow rate of sink or source per unit aquifer volume t 1 the first term in the right side of the equation is diffusion dispersion term the second term is the advection term and the last term is the source and sink term three main assumptions were made to simulate nitrate transport in the study area s groundwater first the nitrate load from the bottom of the root zone was applied to the groundwater table in the same year impacts of the unsaturated zone on the nitrate level attenuation and travel time delays were not considered in the model second the study aquifer is a largely oxic basin with slow denitrification rates mcmahon et al 2008 therefore groundwater denitrification was neglected third we assumed that nitrate is not adsorbed to solid phases initial concentration of nitrate across the aquifer was estimated based on available limited data from sampling wells distributed vertically and horizontally in the study area the active transport model domain was the same as the active flow model domain prescribed nitrate flux was used to simulate boundary solute leached into the groundwater system using monthly stress periods table 2 streams were presumed to have negligible nitrate relative to loading from the land surface in the model nitrogen fertilizers leached from agricultural lands were considered to be the main source of nitrate contamination the nitrogen load was continuously applied on farms over a period of 12 months nitrate concentration of the recharged water was calculated using a mass balance approach using the estimated amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied and the nitrogen available in harvested plants for each crop type see rosenstock et al 2014 harter et al 2017 for details their work assumed that nitrogen mass inflows balances outflows no change in root zone storage over the long run 15 years and more hence cropland nitrate leaching to groundwater was estimated by adding known applied fertilizer and other inputs to a field and then subtracting the harvested nitrogen atmospheric losses and runoff the annually leached mass of nitrate entered groundwater beneath farmlands table 3 the 2004 land use distribution from the original modflow owhm file was used for the prediction simulation period i e 2005 2064 see table 3 since there was no field measurement or test for transport parameters in the study area the longitudinal dispersivity was estimated based on the work of schulze makuch 2005 he presented comprehensive data sets at various scales and provided the following best fitted empirical power law relationship that describes longitudinal dispersivity data with respect to scale of measurement α c l m where is longitudinal dispersivity c is characteristic parameter of the geological medium l is the flow distance and m is the scaling exponent selected values for the above parameters m 0 81 c 0 085 are based on the table provided in schulze makuch 2005 for an unconsolidated medium 2 3 source area management scenarios a number of potential future scenarios are considered for the source area of the public supply wells business as usual a change in nutrient loading a change to agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar during winter months and a combination of these alternative practices lower nitrate mass loading from the root zone may be achieved either by replacing high intensity crops e g almonds corn with low intensity crops that require significantly less nitrogen input e g alfalfa vineyards and therefore reduce the risk of nitrogen losses or it may be achieved by significantly improving nitrogen management practices without changing the crop to achieve low nitrate mass losses winter recharge in agricultural fields ag mar provides additional recharge volume at a time when mobile nitrate availability in the vadose zone is presumed to be minimal ag mar is therefore assumed not to affect the amount of nitrate mass loss both management practices lead to reduction in concentration one by reducing the nitrogen mass flux without similar reduction in recharge the other by increasing the water flux without increasing nitrate mass flux fig 5 one practice is focused on improving nutrient management possibly by crop selection the other focuses on increasing recharge in the source area which may be achieved in a number of ways six scenarios were developed which are described in the following sub sections 2 3 1 business as usual bau scenario the business as usual bau scenario demonstrates the nitrate trends at the supply well in the absence of any changes to agricultural resources management during next 60 years for this baseline scenario we assume that the land use distribution during the last year of the phillips et al 2015 model continues for the remainder of the 60 year simulation period 2 3 2 low intensity crop lic scenario harter et al 2017 estimated the intensity of nitrate n mass leaching to groundwater kg n ha 1 a 1 from 58 crop categories in the central valley using a mass balance approach only alfalfa leaching was estimated from field experiments alfalfa is a nitrogen fixing legume with little n fertilizer applied in practice non crop sources of groundwater nitrate were assessed by reviewing permit records literature sources and by conducting surveys to estimate groundwater nitrate loading viers et al 2012 introduced an operational benchmark of 35 kg n ha 1 a 1 delineating low intensity from high intensity of nitrate leaching to groundwater the benchmark was based on the maximum contamination level mcl of nitrate 10 mg n l or 30 kg n ha 1 a 1 in 300 mm a 1 of recharge which is a recharge rate typical for irrigated landscape and assumed 10 20 denitrification of leached n crops with estimated leaching rates significantly above the benchmark include manured forage crops vegetables subtropical tree fruit and nut crops crops with leaching rates at or below the benchmark include vineyards and alfalfa harter et al 2017 the lic scenario reflects for example replacement of current high fertilizer intensity crop types i e almonds in this study with a low intensity crop here alfalfa in the recharge source area of the public supply well or a change in almond management practices that result in significantly reduced nitrate leaching rates equivalent to those for alfalfa the recharge rate for alfalfa lands was estimated from surrounding lands on which alfalfa was the main crop and had the same soil type concentration of nitrate in the recharged water was derived from the amount of nitrate load for alfalfa reported by harter et al 2017 30 kg n ha 1 a 1 nitrate mass flux at the water table is assumed to be uniform throughout the year without seasonal variations this scenario may also represent other crop changes e g to vineyards that lead to this leaching rate 2 3 3 winter recharge wr scenario groundwater is one of the major sources for irrigation in semi arid agricultural regions like the central valley of california optimum use of seasonal floodwater from excess rainfall to recharge aquifers is a promising approach to improve both quantity kocis and dahlke 2017 and quality of groundwater in these areas winter recharge in the agricultural landscape between november and april is achieved by directing stormwater runoff in streams onto farms via their irrigation system we consider this approach here as a third scenario suitable crop types are here limited to those currently under consideration almonds alfalfa and vineyards bachand et al 2014 winter recharge months include the period from january to june we consider two separate scenarios of winter recharge the wr regular scenario assumes that recharge water is available each winter through water management arrangements that secure water for recharge from upstream reservoirs a more constrained scenario wr irregular limits recharge to those winter months when additional floodwater is actually available during wet years kocis and dahlke 2017 estimated high magnitude streamflow dynamics and availability for all major central valley streams the public supply well studied is in proximity to the tuolumne river fig 4 which was used here to determine the frequency and amount of available floodwater in both scenarios the annual winter recharge in alfalfa and almond was capped based on soil and agronomic considerations almond orchards are thought to accommodate up to 0 6 m yr of winter recharge helen dahlke cwemf presentation 2018 while alfalfa is here assumed to tolerate winter recharge of up to 1 8 m yr dahlke et al 2018 only source area locations overlying soils with moderately good to excellent rating in the california soil agricultural groundwater banking index sagbi were considered here the amount of recharge water diverted to the source area per monthly stress period was computed from the number of modflow cells with landuse alfalfa or almond on suitable soils the maximum allowable recharge rate on these crops and in wr regular the length of the winter recharge period in wr irregular the diversion could not exceed the monthly available floodwater calculated for the tuolumne river and was terminated once the annual cap for each crop was reached fig 6 2 3 4 low intensity crop and winter recharge lic wr scenario the fourth scenario combines the two previous scenarios table 4 storm water is assumed to be available for recharge during the winter months and nitrate leaching in almond orchards of the source area is reduced to 30 kg n ha yr either by crop replacement or nutrient management changes the total area of farmland receiving floodwater is the same as in the wr scenarios the total volume of diverted water is calculated here assuming that lic is achieved by changing landuse to alfalfa allowing for 1 8 m yr of recharge instead of 0 6 m yr fig 7 both regular recharge scenarios and irregular hydrologically constrained recharge scenarios were simulated 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation concentration of nitrate in 170 production and domestic wells across the study region were obtained from various studies https www waterboards ca gov water issues programs gama online tools html where screen depth was provided as part of the water quality data record data spanning the time period from 1960 to 2005 were assembled although sampling frequency at any particular well and data density varies widely from decade to decade boyle et al 2012 king et al 2012 the measured water quality dataset was compared against the range of simulated nitrate n concentrations at the same location depth and time as the measured wells by decade from 1960 to 2005 fig 8 overall measured data show a wider distribution than simulated data while simulated data capture long term trends very well the decadal medians of nitrate at measured locations on the date of sampling differ between measured and simulated datasets from 0 5 1990s to 2 0 mg n l 1960s indicating that simulated nitrate capture most of the measured variability but also the strong decadal concentrations trends measured and simulated nitrate n concentration increase from 5 mgn l in the 1960s to over 7 mg n l in the 1990s but then show a decrease again in the early 2000s fig 8 both measured and simulated data show increasing variability in nitrate n concentrations among measured wells with time especially during the last 15 years 1990 2005 the transport simulation captures regional changes in nitrate concentrations throughout time but it does not capture the large variability among measured data for additional validation a set of four sampling wells were selected from the data set each with multiple nitrate sampling dates all four wells are within or near study area cities fig 9 wells w1 w2 and w4 are in modesto ceres and turlock respectively and well w3 is near the public supply well of our case study shown in fig 10 each well had measured nitrate data available since at least 1995 sometimes earlier breakthrough curves for these specific wells demonstrate that the model is capable of capturing both the magnitude of nitrate concentration and long term trends at a given location fig 9 while it does not capture actual seasonal and annual fluctuations in nitrate concentration some of which can be quite large the larger variability of the measured versus simulated data shown in figs 8 and 9 reflect multiple sources of variability in space and time that affect measured nitrate concentration but are not represented in the model within crop field to field and year to year variation in nitrate loading farm to farm variability in nitrogen management that also affects groundwater nitrate loading the model only represents long term average differences in nitrate loading between crop types aquifer heterogeneity at scales smaller than the model grid cell dimensions and lack of accounting for localized denitrification processes either during the recharge process or in groundwater they may also represent sampling errors or unknown differences in the sampling protocol e g sampling during pumping season versus sampling during non pumping season the overall agreement between simulated and measured nitrate concentration during the validation period even at individual well locations and especially across the study region fig 8 demonstrates that the selected modeling approach nitrate loading as well as groundwater flow and transport is sufficient to guide assessment and future decision making and more specifically to develop a proof of concept for the scenarios simulated in this study at the same time the model validation serves to bracket the potential accuracy of the simulated outcomes and cautions for interpreting results as accurate in trend relative difference and magnitude but not in absolute numbers 3 2 water quality improvements in the public supply well the scenarios begin in the year 2005 in 2004 the last year under standard conditions across all scenarios nitrate concentrations in the supply well were about 8 mg n l and increasing under the bau scenario nitrate concentrations continue to increase exceeding the mcl about one decade later the rapid increase slows down after 2020 but nitrate concentrations continue to steadily increase throughout the simulation period by 2065 rising nitrate n is 20 above the mcl fig 10 3 2 1 nitrate attenuation in alternative scenarios all alternative source area management scenarios improved water quality in the public supply well relative to the bau scenario in fact in all scenarios nitrate concentration improve relative to starting conditions in 2005 except in the wr irregular scenario while improvements are notable relative to the bau with wr irregular the practice is insufficient to stop the rise in nitrate concentrations it is merely slowed down the continued rise in nitrate in concentration for wr irregular reflects continued high nitrate concentrations in recharge during years with no winter flood water applied in the source area relative to bau wr irregular reduces nitrate concentration by 10 during the 60 year scenario period it is the least efficient technique in this study for nitrate attenuation at the public supply well the results indicate that in this region the application of winter recharge during years with sufficient flood water has benefits with respect to groundwater storage but water quality benefits are relatively limited without additional measures especially where nitrate concentrations are already near or above the regulatory level to achieve a more desirable long term groundwater nitrate concentrations without changes in nutrient management practices or crops regular winter recharge is needed scenario wr regular this could be achieved for example through water management arrangements with upstream reservoirs to deliver an additional 0 53 mcm million cubic meters per year 430 acre feet year for winter recharge the wr regular scenario reduces nitrate to stable levels near 9 5 mg n l below the mcl but not lower than in 2005 the additional recharge is sufficient to dilute the nitrogen loading in the source area to levels not exceeding the mcl the decrease in supply well concentration relative to bau is three times larger than in the case of the wr irregular scenario the wr regular scenario also leads to a very small 5 increase in nitrate concentration relative to bau during the early years immediately after the beginning of scenario and before nitrate concentrations improve the slightly higher nitrate concentrations in the wr regular scenario are due to the acceleration of flow between the recharge area where water levels are higher relative to bau and hydraulic gradients to the well are steeper leading to faster travel times relative to bau the ameliorated higher concentrations prior to arrival of recharge water at the well therefore arrive earlier than in the bau scenario causing the relatively higher concentrations prior to arrival in this case the small increase would be of little practical consequence however we note that our wr scenarios did not consider the mobilization of existing legacy nitrate that may be stored in the unsaturated zone by ag mar the lic scenario under which nitrate leaching at the water table in the source area is limited to 30 kg n ha yr e g by changing the crop type to alfalfa begins to show a slow down in the increase in nitrate concentrations within 5 7 years after initiation then leads to a rapid decrease in nitrate concentrations after 2012 to levels that are about half of the nitrate concentration in 2005 combining the lic scenario with winter recharge leads to even more rapid response time and larger decrease in nitrate levels the licwr irregular scenario displays similar extent of nitrate removal as the lic scenario the highest nitrate attenuation occurs with implementation of the licwr regular practice this scenario removes 80 of nitrate concentration from the drinking water at the public supply well after 60 years 3 2 2 response time for water quality improvements under all alternative scenarios the rise in nitrate concentrations at the supply well continues for at least 5 years this is expected given the travel time between the source area and the supply well screen location in the aquifer fig 4 under the most aggressive scenario licwr regular concentrations begin to rapidly decrease after 2010 winter recharge in average and wet years only wr irregular is found to be the least aggressive scenario but even with this approach improvements over bau can be seen beginning in 2015 ten years after the scenario s initiation this lag time is at about the time at which the supply well exceeds the nitrate mcl in both bau and the wr irregular scenario fig 10 other scenarios have an intermediate lag time between 5 and 10 years before improvements begin stable steady nitrate concentrations in the public supply well are achieved only after a much longer period of time fig 10 ranging from three decades in the licwr regular scenario to nearly six decades in the licwr irregular scenario bau and wr irregular do not reach steady conditions within the simulation period 3 3 water quality improvements in ambient groundwater rural households outside community water supply boundaries typically rely on shallow domestic wells with low extraction rate 0 002 mcm per year the simulated scenarios offer significant insight on ambient groundwater quality relevant to these domestic wells for the analysis we consider the vertical nitrate profile throughout the capture zone of the public supply well we average nitrate concentration across all depth specific cells within the flow path zone emanating from the source area to the supply well this averaging process includes only those cells that intersect the flow paths between source area and well colored area in fig 11 top flow paths to the public supply well are located above the corcoran clay layer for the bau scenario nitrate concentration above this layer is much higher than underneath the corcoran clay highest bau concentrations are found near the water table concentrations decrease with depth implementation of alternative future scenarios significantly changes ambient nitrate distribution above this confining layer relative to bau wr irregular improves ambient groundwater in the shallow most groundwater within the upper 35 m on the other hand the wr regular scenario shows 20 more reduction of nitrate during the same period the comparison of wr irregular and wr regular scenarios reveals the importance of recharge frequency to groundwater quality improvement that is relevant to shallow domestic wells lic doubles the percentage of nitrate improvements within ambient groundwater consistent with the breakthrough curves at the supply well ambient groundwater quality improves most under licwr scenarios licwr regular scenario improved ambient groundwater quality by 60 after 60 years of application results confirm findings in similar groundwater modeling scenarios implemented for the alta irrigation district in the southern part of the central valley california luhdorff and scalmanini consulting engineers lsce and larry walker and associates lwa 2016 the study analyzed the application of selected practices including recharge nutrient management abandonment of agriculture and local pump and fertilize scenarios across the entire region not focused on the source area of wells surface restoration activities and nutrient management schemes were shown to improve the ambient groundwater quality in small geographic settings on farm recharge practices were shown to flush the root zone and move low quality shallow water to deeper zones of the aquifer also it was found that pump treat and reinject plans were not practicable for implementation across larger regions 1 km2 luhdorff and scalmanini consulting engineers lsce and larry walker and associates lwa 2016 king et al 2012 3 4 source area management and costs under the bau scenario the public supply well produces 69 mcm over the 60 scenario years 1 15 mcm year from a source area that extends over 400 ha 1000 acres 25 model cells that corresponds to an average bau scenario source area recharge rate of 0 29 m year nearly half of the source area 12 cells is in urban land use fig 4 eight cells 128 ha 320 acres are almond orchards and one cell 16 ha 40 acres is an alfalfa field the remainder of the area 4 cells is in pasture corn and beans winter recharge water wr scenarios was diverted to almond and alfalfa land use table 5 in the lic scenario almond land use was replaced by alfalfa improving nitrate mass loading to the water table in the lic wr scenarios the lic land use change to alfalfa also allows for additional recharge as alfalfa is more tolerant of winter irrigation the additional recharge to the system is lowest in the wr irregular scenario 9 5 mcm but 8 2 times larger in the highest recharge scenario licwr regular 78 mcm the difference in recharge between wr and licwr scenarios is about 2 5 fold over the 720 month scenario period 108 months were wet with floodwater available for the irregular scenarios the volume of water available for the regular scenarios is about 3 times larger than under the corresponding irregular winter recharge scenario the additional recharge water represents 14 46 33 and 113 of the public supply well pumping rate for the wr irregular wr regular licwr irregular and licwr regular scenario respectively the economic feasibility of the alternative scenarios is driven by the cost of additional winter recharge operations and the net cost of land use conversion to alfalfa or other low nitrogen intensity crops current irrigation water rates in the area vary from 0 0016 m3 to 0 032 m3 http www mid org water irrigation allocation html compared to at least 0 50 m3 for domestic water charged by community water suppliers https www ci ceres ca us documentcenter view 2192 water rate and connection fee update for the scenario supplying the largest amount of water licwr regular the cost of the additional recharge water 113 of the water pumped at the public supply well would therefore be as much as 7 of the current cost to public water supply users 1 13 0 032 0 50 assuming that the cost of winter recharge water is equal to the highest current irrigation water rate including any operational and permitting expenditures land use conversion from almond orchard to alfalfa requires up front investments and more importantly will lead to decreased production income mayzelle et al 2015 the initial cost to establish an alfalfa field is relatively small at 3140 ha frate et al 2008 while net total economic losses are on the order of 8000 ha year due to the much lower net profit from alfalfa production when compared to almond production mayzelle et al 2015 the cost of the conversion of 128 ha of almond orchard to alfalfa would be equivalent to 0 90 m3 of water produced at the public supply well assuming that the additional cost would be born by the supply well utility this would bring costs within the range of typical surface water based drinking water supply in california california public utilities commission 2016 the cost analysis for the lic and lic wr scenarios using alfalfa is likely a worst cost case it does not account for flood risk reduction benefits which may outweigh these costs and it does not consider more valuable alternative low nitrogen intensity crops including improved nitrogen management in the almond orchard or conversion to vineyard landuse mayzelle et al 2015 conversion of the almond orchard to wine grape vineyard a crop that has similar low nitrate mass losses to groundwater as alfalfa is suitable for winter recharge and grown commonly in the area and would likely erase production losses over the current almond production california department of food and agriculture 2017 however establishing the vineyard is expensive on the order of 40 000 ha verdegaal et al 2012 when spreading this cost over 20 years for the 128 ha of current almond orchard this amounts to 0 22 m3 of water pumped from the public supply well the cost is significantly lower than the conversion to alfalfa but much higher than regular winter recharge the costs compare favorably to well head treatment another alternative available to the public supply well operator ion exchange treatment for nitrate is a common approach with total costs in the range from 0 19 to 0 57 m3 jensen et al 2014 another source area management alternative foregoing both conversion cost and profit losses would be to implement rigorous nutrient management in the almond orchards within the source area given the high nitrogen input to almond orchards it may be difficult to achieve n losses not exceeding 30 kg n ha yr at the water table even under very efficient management practices however lic scenario results indicate that nitrate concentrations at the public supply well would stabilize below the mcl even if nitrate leaching under the almond orchard is twice the amount simulated that is 60 kg n ha yr which is still far less than under the bau scenario adding wr to such nutrient management in the source area would provide further relief and additional insurance for keeping water quality in the supply well below the mcl over the long term 3 5 implications for region wide groundwater quality protection our findings can be used at regional or state scale for nitrate removal plans the total number of community water systems in california that rely on groundwater as a primary source of drinking water is around 2584 which use 8396 active wells serving 4 1 million people department of water resources 2013 many of these groundwater reliant community water systems are in rural areas throughout the state state water resources control board 2013 nitrate was detected above mcl in 451 wells associated with 205 community water systems dwr 2013 therefore approximately 8 of community water systems in california have nitrate problem swrcb 2017 which serve drinking water to 328 000 people state wide many of them in the central valley the water supplied to these communities is treated and delivered at a cost typically on the order of 0 30 0 60 m3 honeycutt et al 2012 if we assume a per capita water consumption of 0 7 m3 d mount et al 2014 total groundwater pumping in these wells is on the order of 84 mcm yr if addressed through source area management including winter recharge the case study presented here suggests that recharging nearly the same amount of water pumped under the licwr regular scenario provides significant groundwater quality improvements statewide that amounts to 84 mcm per year of winter recharge focused in the source area of at risk public supply wells as the number of community water supply systems that will exceed the nitrate mcl will likely rise significantly over the next twenty years honeycutt et al 2012 the need for such recharge may increase to as much as 200 mcm for comparison the estimated amount of unused flood water available in the central valley during an average or wet year is 3200 mcm kocis and dahlke 2017 a significant fraction of the amount of flood water available for recharge may be needed to implement wr or lic wr type scenarios as long term alternatives to drinking water treatment on the other hand winter recharge would not suffice to address much of the domestic well water pollution due to the wide spread occurrence of domestic wells and high nitrate groundwater concentration ransom et al 2017 3 6 limitations and uncertainties through the process of developing the flow and transport simulations presented in this study some conceptual assumptions and a set of numerical parameters were used which are sources of uncertainty in the expected nitrate concentration values while the underlying transient flow model was informed by detailed hydrogeologic architecture data and calibrated against measured water levels and stream flows phillips et al 2015 and while modeled nitrate concentrations and trends agree with measured data in the region for 1960 to 2005 the transport model does not reflect some source and aquifer variability affecting measured nitrate in wells section 3 1 hydraulic properties porosity and hence pore water velocities are among the most variable and uncertain parameters resulting in uncertainty about travel time but also about the exact location of the source area henri and harter 2019 despite the significant amount of aquifer heterogeneity captured by the underlying geologic framework historic and current nitrate loading is based on published land use maps statistics and reported average nutrient management practices and average harvest rates soil nitrogen accumulation local denitrification and other processes may significantly affect the actual nitrate leaching rate ransom et al 2018 developed n loading estimates based on groundwater nitrate measurements confirming the overall magnitude of groundwater nitrate loading used here but also demonstrating that rates vary widely and may be lower for nut crops than estimates based on field n surplus for actual project implementation this will require improved hydrogeologic characterization of the likely source area of a supply well or alternatively the designation of a larger source area zone within which targeted management practices are applied monitoring of water quality near the source zone would provide early confirmation of potential improvements in water quality unsaturated zone travel time complex root zone processes including denitrification n mineralization n uptake into soil organic matter may vary widely within the central valley or other agricultural regions with similar climatic and hydrogeologic conditions unsaturated zone travel time may be particularly long in semi arid regions with highly efficient irrigation systems minimal annual recharge rates much smaller than 300 mm and in regions with deep vadose zones 20 m harter et al 2005 on the other hand there is significant evidence for preferential flow and rapid vadose zone transport under irrigation botros et al 2011 turkeltaub et al 2014 under certain climate and soil conditions fertilizer n undergoes significant storage in the soil carbon pool sebilo et al 2013 and increase n storage in the root zone geisseler and scow 2014 before being released in the central valley therefore considering unsaturated variations to the simulations could increase the modeled nitrate values and lengthen the response time in the system here soil and deep vadose zone denitrification processes were considered by assuming a 10 loss of the n surplus prior to recharge harter et al 2017 groundwater denitrification was neglected thus leading to conservatively high concentration predictions for the early time predictions 2005 2020 actual denitrification rates in the oxic aquifer system are typically sufficiently small enough to not justify the assumptions longer transport may in fact be significantly affected by denitrification especially when transport occurs through the clayey fractions of the alluvial aquifer system architecture mcmahon et al 2008 this work also neglected seasonal variations in nitrate loading and relied on an average annualized loss rate under the mediterranean climate conditions in the central valley leaching losses during the growing season are largely controlled by irrigation efficient water and nutrient management practices may lead to minimal water and nitrogen losses during the growing season even in crops with high n demand if properly managed baram et al 2016 residual nitrogen remaining after harvest is subject to root zone flushing by winter rains a major source of recharge under effective management under more traditional bau management practices significant recharge occurs during the growing season combined with n losses occur due to irrigation nonuniformity and low irrigation efficiency alva et al 2006 while these seasonal and daily dynamics significantly affect leaching of nitrate applying an annualized average nitrate leaching rate was considered appropriate here not only because of the lack of more detailed input data but also because of the mixing of water of a range of age in supply wells additional research is needed to better understand this assumption on nitrate dynamics in water supply wells of interest the study here focuses on a proof of concept and on the overall qualitative outcome of wr and lic type management scenarios in the source area of public and domestic water supply wells the study findings relative to the bau scenario are significant despite the uncertainties about site specific conditions to the degree that the setting is typical of many semi arid irrigate agricultural systems overlying unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer systems in mediterranean climates the findings here generally apply not only to the central valley but to regions around the globe although time and spatial scales will vary depending on site conditions 4 conclusions in this study the numerical modeling approach was used to assess changes in nitrate concentration of a public supply well and in ambient groundwater due to implementation of protective agricultural practices in the well s source area the conceptual scenarios include increasing recharge and decreasing nitrate mass load to groundwater simulated breakthrough curves at the public supply well and profile distributions of nitrate in the capture zone indicate that the by far most aggressive management practice is to apply both techniques simultaneously alva et al 2006 achieve lower nitrate losses in the source area by replacing high nitrogen demand crops with low nitrate leaching crops e g alfalfa or vineyards or by aggressive nutrient management improvements and bachand et al 2014 add more clean water to the source area by diverting stored floodwater to fields suitable for winter recharge ag mar in the source area this scenario licwr regular was found to achieve the quickest and most reliable results first improvements were obtained in the public supply wells within less than a decade and full attenuation was achieved within 40 years nitrate levels were 80 lower than under the bau scenario in 2065 in the study area analyzed here other scenarios some involving low nitrate mass loading to groundwater only lic some focused on winter recharge only wr were able to reverse the trend of increasing nitrate and stabilizing nitrate concentrations at levels below the mcl wr scenarios led to a slight increase in nitrate prior to nitrate improvements being observed in the public supply well this was due to the faster travel of legacy nitrate in groundwater following an increase in hydraulic head gradients due to the recharge the two scenarios that failed to provide safe drinking water are the bau scenario and a winter recharge scenario that relies on the highly irregular occurrence of flood water wr irregular at the study site the latter scenario provided relative improvements to the bau with respect to nitrate concentrations in the supply well but not sufficient to meet regulatory requirements aggressive nitrate mass reduction was here achieved by replacing current high nitrate leaching crops almond orchards with alfalfa or wine grape vineyards both of which have low n fertilizer requirements and can be managed to low nitrate leaching losses changing lands to alfalfa or vineyard has two benefits alva et al 2006 it increases the capacity of lands to tolerate extra water and therefore allows for more winter recharge than the almond orchard bachand et al 2014 it decreases the leaching mass of nitrate to groundwater combining nutrient management even in a high fertilizer use crop like almonds with winter recharge may provide sufficient improvements in groundwater quality within the source area to meet water quality at the public supply well after an initial lag time given the cost of recharge water assuming that it does not exceed current high end rates in the study region regular winter recharge would be the most affordable option adding 10 to current water rates of groundwater dependent community water system users given that almonds make up about one third of the source area land use conversion of these orchards to alfalfa would significantly improve long term water quality at the public supply well but at costs that are at or above alternative treatment costs due to the loss in economic productivity converting to higher value low nitrogen emitting crops such as vineyards may economically be more advantageous than well head treatment in the long term despite significant conversion costs a combination of significantly improved nutrient management in the almond orchards and winter recharge may also represent a promising less costly alternative to achieving good water quality in the water supply well these results provide promising alternatives to well head treatment and other technical solutions at least for achieving long term results or to prevent further degradation where nitrate levels do not already exceed the mcl results are scalable to the entire region given the similar climate and the overall water supply conditions this study does not address additional questions regarding the ability to store and redistribute available flood water in the central valley to source areas on a regular if not continuous basis further work is also needed to identify incentive programs that public water supply agencies may pursue in their source areas in collaboration with growers and grower organizations to incentivize appropriate land use

1562,nitrate in drinking water may cause serious health problems for consumers agricultural activities are known to be the main source of groundwater nitrate contaminating rural domestic and urban public water supply wells in farming regions management practices have been proposed to reduce the amount of nitrate in groundwater including improved nutrient management practices and pump and fertilize with nitrate affected irrigation wells here we evaluate the feasibility and long term impacts of agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar in the source area of public water supply wells a numerical model of nitrate fate and transport was developed for the modesto basin part of california s central valley aquifer system the basin is representative of semi arid agricultural regions around the world with a diversity of crop types overlying an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system a local public supply well in an economically disadvantaged community surrounded by farmland was the focus of this study model scenarios implemented include business as usual alternative low impact crops and ag mar in the source area of the public supply well alternative nutrient management and recharge practices act as remediation tools in the area between farmland and the public supply well improved agricultural source area management practices are shown to be an effective tool to maintain or even enhance groundwater quality in the targeted supply well while remediating ambient groundwater best results are obtained when lowering nitrate load while also increasing recharge in the source area simultaneously this scenario reduced nitrate in the supply well s drinking water by 80 relative to the business as usual scenario it also remediated ambient groundwater used by domestic wells between the source area farmlands and the supply well and showed 60 more reduction of nitrate after 60 years of application increasing recharge led to shorter initial response time five years and showed the most sustainable impact our analysis further suggests that ag mar in a highly discontinuous wide spread pattern leads to slow water quality response and may not yield sufficient water quality improvements keywords groundwater quality nitrate pollution agricultural management practices contributing recharge area crop change groundwater remediation 1 introduction groundwater is a critical resource for drinking water and irrigation in the central valley california a region dominated by intensive cultivation of mostly specialty crops burow et al 2008 nitrate is one of the most widespread groundwater contaminants threatening drinking water supplies here and in agricultural regions elsewhere nolan et al 2002 van grinsven et al 2015 wang et al 2016 nitrate causes serious health problems if it exceeds 10 mg n l in drinking water jordan and weller 1996 nitrate transport through groundwater into connected surface water may also significantly affect surface water quality and ecosystem functioning sprague et al 2011 tesoriero et al 2013 nitrate in groundwater is a global problem the european union eu has undertaken broad steps toward managerial regulations that prevent further nitrate pollution of their aquifers hansen et al 2017 the issue is most threatening in some where drinking water suppliers entirely rely on groundwater resources such as denmark gejl et al 2019 studies conducted throughout the eu but also in china and elsewhere have repeatedly identified the historical nitrate loading from cropland as the main contributor to groundwater nitrate pollution in these areas gu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 zhang and hiscock 2016 harter et al 2017 ransom et al 2017 in the subsurface nitrate is the most readily transported form of reactive nitrogen jury and nielson 1989 lacking significant sorption or degradation potential unless reducing geochemical conditions prevail sources include farmland animal agriculture septic systems and naturally occurring nitrate liu et al 2014 irrigated croplands managed with synthetic nitrogen fertilizers or animal manure have been shown to be the largest source of nitrate loading in agricultural areas burow et al 2008 harter et al 2017 the main driver of long term average nitrate leaching from croplands is the balance between nitrogen inputs atmospheric deposition synthetic fertilizer animal manure and nitrogen harvested kirchmann et al 2002 this excess nitrogen is lost in ionic or gaseous form through leaching runoff volatilization and denitrification liu et al 2014 once leached below the root zone denitrification through microbial processes may provide for some or complete natural attenuation of nitrate depending on biogeochemical conditions ransom et al 2017 these conditions also affect the vulnerability of drinking supply wells to nitrate contamination eberts et al 2013 excess nitrogen is transported as nitrate to groundwater via soil percolation and recharge in some instances dry wells abandoned wells or improperly destroyed wells may also act as rapid conduits of nitrate contaminated surface runoff directly into groundwater gailey 2017 in irrigated regions minimizing recharge during the growing season and matching nitrogen applications to crop demand is the primary tool to nitrate source control rosenstock et al 2014 baram et al 2016 and to protect vulnerable public supply wells from nitrate contamination eberts et al 2013 land use change agricultural practice improvements or technological advancements have been shown to help to reduce nitrate contributions to groundwater these techniques a control water application rates to minimize nitrate leaching and b reduce nitrogen quantity applied to the land dzurella et al 2012 lee et al 2017 somura et al 2008 suggested reducing the concentration of nitrate leaching to groundwater by partly or entirely removing livestock area hiscock et al 2007 and zhang and hiscock 2016 showed that land use conversion to forest provides a considerable decrease in groundwater nitrate concentrations in the sherwood sandstone and lincolnshire limestone aquifers in england they used modflow and mt3dms as simulation tools to study different land use scenarios that included partial or complete conversion between arable areas woodlands forest and grasslands they indicated that water quality change of public supply wells is on the order of years to centuries when land use changes occur over days to decades moreover rudolph et al 2015 conducted field experiments to study the performance of regional scale nutrient management practices in the source area of supply wells neither of these studies considered changes to alternative crop types or agricultural managed aquifer recharge the groundwater age mixture in a public supply well is also an important factor on water quality dynamics in the well eberts et al 2013 the travel time distribution from source area to wells is partly due to the complexity of media short circuit pathways in the flow system create a large fraction of young water in the well and provide for faster response to land use change mcmahon et al 2008 the vertical length of the well screen is typically an even more significant contributor than aquifer heterogeneity to wide distribution of travel times within the water exiting a well at any given time henri and harter 2019 travel times of nitrate in the unsaturated zone range from less than one year to decades depending mostly on depth to groundwater and on recharge rates under agricultural activities below the water table nitrate travel times to shallow domestic wells range from a few years to several decades and from one to several decades and even centuries for deeper production wells jurgens et al 2008 van der schans et al 2009 it has recently also been suggested that farmland provides an untapped resource for recharge of seasonal flood and excess water when available during the non growing season niswonger et al 2017 department of water resources 2018 this promising technique is known as agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar ghasemizade et al 2019 key considerations for implementation of ag mar include strong coordination between growers and water managers and selection of farms with suitable crop and soil characteristics while primary consideration of ag mar is for aquifer replenishment we here consider its potential to significantly improve groundwater quality the implementation of water and nutrient management to improve groundwater nitrate conditions may incur significant cost on agriculture medellín azuara et al 2012 mayzelle et al 2015 considered the economic feasibility and cost of the more drastic measure of converting irrigated agricultural land uses surrounding economically disadvantaged communities dac in the tulare lake basin to reduce the risk of nitrate contamination in their public supply wells the source area of all drinking water wells inside dcs was assumed to be a circular region called the protective agricultural buffer zone these buffer zones were devoted to clean recharge basins and conversion of land use to leguminous n fixing crops such as alfalfa or low nitrogen use crops such as vineyards surprisingly the work demonstrated economic gains over 20 years offset some or all the cost of land use conversion for some scenarios in addition it minimizes the cost of drinking water treatment plants operation and maintenance which is important for communities facing financial constraint source area agricultural practices play an important role in determining the water quality in targeted drinking water wells these activities change a the volume of water that enters the groundwater system and b the management of water and nutrients on crops to reduce nitrate mass transported to groundwater we develop a high resolution transient regional flow and transport model to more closely investigate the effects of agricultural practices on future nitrate concentration dynamics in public supply wells and on the quality of groundwater in nearby domestic wells specifically we seek to quantify the effectiveness of a agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar during the rainy winter season and b nitrate load reduction by either growing appropriate alternative crops or by significantly improving nutrient management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area of about 2700 km2 is located in the northeastern san joaquin valley bounded on the western edge by the san joaquin river on the northern edge near the stanislaus river in the south near the merced river and at the eastern edge by the bedrocks of the sierra nevada foothills fig 1 the san joaquin river drains the study area into the san francisco bay pacific ocean the land surface in the study area slopes westward from the sierra nevada foothills to the san joaquin river gradients range from 1 m km near the river to 5 m km in places near the foothills and adjacent to streams and rivers the climate is semi arid characterized by hot summers and mild winters the rainfall averaged 315 mm annually from 1931 to 1997 with most precipitation occurring from late fall through early spring the headwaters of san joaquin river and its tributaries the stanislaus tuolumne and merced rivers originate from the sierra nevada mountains to the north and east of the study area and provide an important source of irrigation water managed through upstream reservoirs phillips et al 2007a agriculture is the major land use covering about 65 of the study area the primary crops are deciduous trees almonds and walnuts peaches grapes and forage crops grain corn pasture and alfalfa in 2010 the cities of modesto and turlock and a number of smaller communities occupy about 7 of the study area the remaining land areas are predominantly dry land vegetation near the foothills and riparian wetlands along river corridors phillips et al 2015 the aquifer system consists of highly heterogeneous alluvial sediments the aquifer is mainly unconfined within the study area although discontinuous fine grained units locally confine sand and gravel layers fig 2 the corcoran clay a semi permeable barrier is a key hydrogeological feature that limits vertical groundwater flow in the western part of the study area the top of the corcoran clay zone is in the range of 25 to 80 m below land surface the confining unit has a maximum thickness of about 58 m the confined aquifer below the corcoran clay is also an important regional water resource phillips et al 2015 prior to groundwater development in the early 1900s streams recharged groundwater predominantly near the mountain front to the northeast of the study area groundwater moved laterally across the basin and discharged at the san joaquin river subsequently groundwater pumping and diversion of water from streams for irrigation added a vertical flow pattern to the groundwater system irrigation water provided significant additional groundwater recharge to the system while irrigation pumpage became the main groundwater discharge from the system burow et al 2008 nitrate is one of the main groundwater contaminants in the study area derived mainly from the application of agricultural nitrogen based fertilizers harter et al 2017 elevated nitrate concentrations in the region are mostly associated with young groundwater in the shallow groundwater system bexfield and jurgens 2014 2 2 flow and transport model development 2 2 1 groundwater flow simulation a calibrated transient three dimensional saturated flow model constructed in modflow owhm phillips et al 2015 was modified to develop simulation conditions for a prediction period from january 2005 to december 2064 the original model represents groundwater flow in the study region from january 1960 to december 2004 with 540 stress periods of one month each the model uses the farm process schmid and hanson 2009 which allocates available surface water to water users and simulates processes associated with agricultural water management recharge groundwater pumping surface water interaction with groundwater and crop parameters to set boundary conditions for solving the groundwater flow equation the model domain covers a total area of 3353 76 km2 using a grid discretized horizontally into 400 m 400 m cells in 153 rows 137 columns and 16 layers layer thickness generally increases with depth ranging from one to 28 m in the top layer total thickness of the model is about 220 to 430 m the corcoran clay layer thickness ranging from 3 to 43 m has been assigned to western cells in layer eight of the model general head dependent boundaries are employed to simulate lateral flow across the model boundaries except along the sierra nevada foothills northeastern boundary which is considered a no flow boundary phillips et al 2015 for the transient flow and transport model in this study we first needed to convert the modflow owhm model into a modflow 2005 framework to create a flow model platform that is compatible with an mt3d zheng 1990 based transport model this was achieved by deriving owhm specific flux boundary conditions from output files of the original model including recharge rates deep percolation of irrigation and precipitation evapotranspiration parameters and private agricultural pumpage location and time specific flux data were used to create suitable modflow 2005 packages to effectively impose the same boundary conditions on the flow model in the second step we modified boundary conditions to represent a cyclical steady state condition for 60 years the original model s year 2004 monthly recharge and pumping conditions were repeated for each of 60 years starting from january 2005 in 720 monthly stress periods fig 3 seasonal pumping and recharge cause significant periodic change in water levels in addition because the 2004 water budget was not entirely balanced water levels showed a long term decrease of about 3 4 cm year over the 60 year period fig 3 2 2 2 supply well selection the regional groundwater flow model was used to delineate the capture zone and the contributing recharge area for a single public supply well located in one of the economically disadvantaged communities dac in the study domain data related to the non farm wells in the well package of the original modflow owhm model were used to select an appropriate supply well for this study these data include spatial distribution of wells well depth and pumping rates only shallow public supply wells were considered for the purpose of this study the concentration of nitrate in groundwater samples from agricultural land use in the area is reported to be much higher in shallow groundwater and less in the deeper aquifer burow et al 2008 2010 in addition deep production wells are likely to receive water with a wide range of ages that increases the mixing of poor quality water with older cleaner water burow et al 2008 the selected well was among wells with longest possible screen interval above the confining layer where agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar practices may have most impact on groundwater quality the selected well is located in the city of ceres adjacent to agricultural lands it has a maximum and minimum pumping rates of 4900 and 1400 m3 d over the scenario period fig 3 2 2 3 recharge area delineation delineation of the production well s source area the area of recharge is a critical step in determining the spatial extent of the area within which to apply alternative agricultural practices that would reduce long term nitrate levels here we use the particle tracking program modpath pollock 2012 to simulate groundwater flow pathlines backwards from the public supply well to the recharge area and to estimate groundwater travel times the pathline particle tracking technique uses advective transport but does not consider dispersion or diffusion cell by cell groundwater flux and effective porosity interconnected pores are the main input information for the modpath program to track particles in time and space the effective porosity used in the current contaminant transport and particle tracking simulations was distributed based on the percentage of coarse grained texture in model cells table 1 the values for each category of porosity is derived from previous work in similar regions the well screen of the targeted public supply well is located along two vertically adjacent cells in the model in layers five and six the top of the screen is at a depth of 26 7 m below ground surface and the screen length is 13 9 m twenty particles were equally distributed at each side of the cells 200 particles in total and released from the well screen every two stress periods 360 release times this frequency of particle release takes the system s transient dynamics into account particles moved from the well screen to the water table backwards over the 60 year simulation time from where the public supply well s water originated twenty five cells were identified as the source area for the drinking water well land use in those cells includes urban and farm lands fig 4 2 2 4 nitrate transport model construction three dimensional transport of nitrate in saturated porous media was simulated using the advection dispersion equation and solved numerically by use of mt3d program zheng and bennett 2002 θc t θd c θvc q s c s where θ is porosity unitless c is the concentration of nitrate in groundwater m l3 v is the seepage velocity v q θ l t d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor l2 t c s is the concentration of the nitrate in source or sink m l3 and q s is the volumetric flow rate of sink or source per unit aquifer volume t 1 the first term in the right side of the equation is diffusion dispersion term the second term is the advection term and the last term is the source and sink term three main assumptions were made to simulate nitrate transport in the study area s groundwater first the nitrate load from the bottom of the root zone was applied to the groundwater table in the same year impacts of the unsaturated zone on the nitrate level attenuation and travel time delays were not considered in the model second the study aquifer is a largely oxic basin with slow denitrification rates mcmahon et al 2008 therefore groundwater denitrification was neglected third we assumed that nitrate is not adsorbed to solid phases initial concentration of nitrate across the aquifer was estimated based on available limited data from sampling wells distributed vertically and horizontally in the study area the active transport model domain was the same as the active flow model domain prescribed nitrate flux was used to simulate boundary solute leached into the groundwater system using monthly stress periods table 2 streams were presumed to have negligible nitrate relative to loading from the land surface in the model nitrogen fertilizers leached from agricultural lands were considered to be the main source of nitrate contamination the nitrogen load was continuously applied on farms over a period of 12 months nitrate concentration of the recharged water was calculated using a mass balance approach using the estimated amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied and the nitrogen available in harvested plants for each crop type see rosenstock et al 2014 harter et al 2017 for details their work assumed that nitrogen mass inflows balances outflows no change in root zone storage over the long run 15 years and more hence cropland nitrate leaching to groundwater was estimated by adding known applied fertilizer and other inputs to a field and then subtracting the harvested nitrogen atmospheric losses and runoff the annually leached mass of nitrate entered groundwater beneath farmlands table 3 the 2004 land use distribution from the original modflow owhm file was used for the prediction simulation period i e 2005 2064 see table 3 since there was no field measurement or test for transport parameters in the study area the longitudinal dispersivity was estimated based on the work of schulze makuch 2005 he presented comprehensive data sets at various scales and provided the following best fitted empirical power law relationship that describes longitudinal dispersivity data with respect to scale of measurement α c l m where is longitudinal dispersivity c is characteristic parameter of the geological medium l is the flow distance and m is the scaling exponent selected values for the above parameters m 0 81 c 0 085 are based on the table provided in schulze makuch 2005 for an unconsolidated medium 2 3 source area management scenarios a number of potential future scenarios are considered for the source area of the public supply wells business as usual a change in nutrient loading a change to agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar during winter months and a combination of these alternative practices lower nitrate mass loading from the root zone may be achieved either by replacing high intensity crops e g almonds corn with low intensity crops that require significantly less nitrogen input e g alfalfa vineyards and therefore reduce the risk of nitrogen losses or it may be achieved by significantly improving nitrogen management practices without changing the crop to achieve low nitrate mass losses winter recharge in agricultural fields ag mar provides additional recharge volume at a time when mobile nitrate availability in the vadose zone is presumed to be minimal ag mar is therefore assumed not to affect the amount of nitrate mass loss both management practices lead to reduction in concentration one by reducing the nitrogen mass flux without similar reduction in recharge the other by increasing the water flux without increasing nitrate mass flux fig 5 one practice is focused on improving nutrient management possibly by crop selection the other focuses on increasing recharge in the source area which may be achieved in a number of ways six scenarios were developed which are described in the following sub sections 2 3 1 business as usual bau scenario the business as usual bau scenario demonstrates the nitrate trends at the supply well in the absence of any changes to agricultural resources management during next 60 years for this baseline scenario we assume that the land use distribution during the last year of the phillips et al 2015 model continues for the remainder of the 60 year simulation period 2 3 2 low intensity crop lic scenario harter et al 2017 estimated the intensity of nitrate n mass leaching to groundwater kg n ha 1 a 1 from 58 crop categories in the central valley using a mass balance approach only alfalfa leaching was estimated from field experiments alfalfa is a nitrogen fixing legume with little n fertilizer applied in practice non crop sources of groundwater nitrate were assessed by reviewing permit records literature sources and by conducting surveys to estimate groundwater nitrate loading viers et al 2012 introduced an operational benchmark of 35 kg n ha 1 a 1 delineating low intensity from high intensity of nitrate leaching to groundwater the benchmark was based on the maximum contamination level mcl of nitrate 10 mg n l or 30 kg n ha 1 a 1 in 300 mm a 1 of recharge which is a recharge rate typical for irrigated landscape and assumed 10 20 denitrification of leached n crops with estimated leaching rates significantly above the benchmark include manured forage crops vegetables subtropical tree fruit and nut crops crops with leaching rates at or below the benchmark include vineyards and alfalfa harter et al 2017 the lic scenario reflects for example replacement of current high fertilizer intensity crop types i e almonds in this study with a low intensity crop here alfalfa in the recharge source area of the public supply well or a change in almond management practices that result in significantly reduced nitrate leaching rates equivalent to those for alfalfa the recharge rate for alfalfa lands was estimated from surrounding lands on which alfalfa was the main crop and had the same soil type concentration of nitrate in the recharged water was derived from the amount of nitrate load for alfalfa reported by harter et al 2017 30 kg n ha 1 a 1 nitrate mass flux at the water table is assumed to be uniform throughout the year without seasonal variations this scenario may also represent other crop changes e g to vineyards that lead to this leaching rate 2 3 3 winter recharge wr scenario groundwater is one of the major sources for irrigation in semi arid agricultural regions like the central valley of california optimum use of seasonal floodwater from excess rainfall to recharge aquifers is a promising approach to improve both quantity kocis and dahlke 2017 and quality of groundwater in these areas winter recharge in the agricultural landscape between november and april is achieved by directing stormwater runoff in streams onto farms via their irrigation system we consider this approach here as a third scenario suitable crop types are here limited to those currently under consideration almonds alfalfa and vineyards bachand et al 2014 winter recharge months include the period from january to june we consider two separate scenarios of winter recharge the wr regular scenario assumes that recharge water is available each winter through water management arrangements that secure water for recharge from upstream reservoirs a more constrained scenario wr irregular limits recharge to those winter months when additional floodwater is actually available during wet years kocis and dahlke 2017 estimated high magnitude streamflow dynamics and availability for all major central valley streams the public supply well studied is in proximity to the tuolumne river fig 4 which was used here to determine the frequency and amount of available floodwater in both scenarios the annual winter recharge in alfalfa and almond was capped based on soil and agronomic considerations almond orchards are thought to accommodate up to 0 6 m yr of winter recharge helen dahlke cwemf presentation 2018 while alfalfa is here assumed to tolerate winter recharge of up to 1 8 m yr dahlke et al 2018 only source area locations overlying soils with moderately good to excellent rating in the california soil agricultural groundwater banking index sagbi were considered here the amount of recharge water diverted to the source area per monthly stress period was computed from the number of modflow cells with landuse alfalfa or almond on suitable soils the maximum allowable recharge rate on these crops and in wr regular the length of the winter recharge period in wr irregular the diversion could not exceed the monthly available floodwater calculated for the tuolumne river and was terminated once the annual cap for each crop was reached fig 6 2 3 4 low intensity crop and winter recharge lic wr scenario the fourth scenario combines the two previous scenarios table 4 storm water is assumed to be available for recharge during the winter months and nitrate leaching in almond orchards of the source area is reduced to 30 kg n ha yr either by crop replacement or nutrient management changes the total area of farmland receiving floodwater is the same as in the wr scenarios the total volume of diverted water is calculated here assuming that lic is achieved by changing landuse to alfalfa allowing for 1 8 m yr of recharge instead of 0 6 m yr fig 7 both regular recharge scenarios and irregular hydrologically constrained recharge scenarios were simulated 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation concentration of nitrate in 170 production and domestic wells across the study region were obtained from various studies https www waterboards ca gov water issues programs gama online tools html where screen depth was provided as part of the water quality data record data spanning the time period from 1960 to 2005 were assembled although sampling frequency at any particular well and data density varies widely from decade to decade boyle et al 2012 king et al 2012 the measured water quality dataset was compared against the range of simulated nitrate n concentrations at the same location depth and time as the measured wells by decade from 1960 to 2005 fig 8 overall measured data show a wider distribution than simulated data while simulated data capture long term trends very well the decadal medians of nitrate at measured locations on the date of sampling differ between measured and simulated datasets from 0 5 1990s to 2 0 mg n l 1960s indicating that simulated nitrate capture most of the measured variability but also the strong decadal concentrations trends measured and simulated nitrate n concentration increase from 5 mgn l in the 1960s to over 7 mg n l in the 1990s but then show a decrease again in the early 2000s fig 8 both measured and simulated data show increasing variability in nitrate n concentrations among measured wells with time especially during the last 15 years 1990 2005 the transport simulation captures regional changes in nitrate concentrations throughout time but it does not capture the large variability among measured data for additional validation a set of four sampling wells were selected from the data set each with multiple nitrate sampling dates all four wells are within or near study area cities fig 9 wells w1 w2 and w4 are in modesto ceres and turlock respectively and well w3 is near the public supply well of our case study shown in fig 10 each well had measured nitrate data available since at least 1995 sometimes earlier breakthrough curves for these specific wells demonstrate that the model is capable of capturing both the magnitude of nitrate concentration and long term trends at a given location fig 9 while it does not capture actual seasonal and annual fluctuations in nitrate concentration some of which can be quite large the larger variability of the measured versus simulated data shown in figs 8 and 9 reflect multiple sources of variability in space and time that affect measured nitrate concentration but are not represented in the model within crop field to field and year to year variation in nitrate loading farm to farm variability in nitrogen management that also affects groundwater nitrate loading the model only represents long term average differences in nitrate loading between crop types aquifer heterogeneity at scales smaller than the model grid cell dimensions and lack of accounting for localized denitrification processes either during the recharge process or in groundwater they may also represent sampling errors or unknown differences in the sampling protocol e g sampling during pumping season versus sampling during non pumping season the overall agreement between simulated and measured nitrate concentration during the validation period even at individual well locations and especially across the study region fig 8 demonstrates that the selected modeling approach nitrate loading as well as groundwater flow and transport is sufficient to guide assessment and future decision making and more specifically to develop a proof of concept for the scenarios simulated in this study at the same time the model validation serves to bracket the potential accuracy of the simulated outcomes and cautions for interpreting results as accurate in trend relative difference and magnitude but not in absolute numbers 3 2 water quality improvements in the public supply well the scenarios begin in the year 2005 in 2004 the last year under standard conditions across all scenarios nitrate concentrations in the supply well were about 8 mg n l and increasing under the bau scenario nitrate concentrations continue to increase exceeding the mcl about one decade later the rapid increase slows down after 2020 but nitrate concentrations continue to steadily increase throughout the simulation period by 2065 rising nitrate n is 20 above the mcl fig 10 3 2 1 nitrate attenuation in alternative scenarios all alternative source area management scenarios improved water quality in the public supply well relative to the bau scenario in fact in all scenarios nitrate concentration improve relative to starting conditions in 2005 except in the wr irregular scenario while improvements are notable relative to the bau with wr irregular the practice is insufficient to stop the rise in nitrate concentrations it is merely slowed down the continued rise in nitrate in concentration for wr irregular reflects continued high nitrate concentrations in recharge during years with no winter flood water applied in the source area relative to bau wr irregular reduces nitrate concentration by 10 during the 60 year scenario period it is the least efficient technique in this study for nitrate attenuation at the public supply well the results indicate that in this region the application of winter recharge during years with sufficient flood water has benefits with respect to groundwater storage but water quality benefits are relatively limited without additional measures especially where nitrate concentrations are already near or above the regulatory level to achieve a more desirable long term groundwater nitrate concentrations without changes in nutrient management practices or crops regular winter recharge is needed scenario wr regular this could be achieved for example through water management arrangements with upstream reservoirs to deliver an additional 0 53 mcm million cubic meters per year 430 acre feet year for winter recharge the wr regular scenario reduces nitrate to stable levels near 9 5 mg n l below the mcl but not lower than in 2005 the additional recharge is sufficient to dilute the nitrogen loading in the source area to levels not exceeding the mcl the decrease in supply well concentration relative to bau is three times larger than in the case of the wr irregular scenario the wr regular scenario also leads to a very small 5 increase in nitrate concentration relative to bau during the early years immediately after the beginning of scenario and before nitrate concentrations improve the slightly higher nitrate concentrations in the wr regular scenario are due to the acceleration of flow between the recharge area where water levels are higher relative to bau and hydraulic gradients to the well are steeper leading to faster travel times relative to bau the ameliorated higher concentrations prior to arrival of recharge water at the well therefore arrive earlier than in the bau scenario causing the relatively higher concentrations prior to arrival in this case the small increase would be of little practical consequence however we note that our wr scenarios did not consider the mobilization of existing legacy nitrate that may be stored in the unsaturated zone by ag mar the lic scenario under which nitrate leaching at the water table in the source area is limited to 30 kg n ha yr e g by changing the crop type to alfalfa begins to show a slow down in the increase in nitrate concentrations within 5 7 years after initiation then leads to a rapid decrease in nitrate concentrations after 2012 to levels that are about half of the nitrate concentration in 2005 combining the lic scenario with winter recharge leads to even more rapid response time and larger decrease in nitrate levels the licwr irregular scenario displays similar extent of nitrate removal as the lic scenario the highest nitrate attenuation occurs with implementation of the licwr regular practice this scenario removes 80 of nitrate concentration from the drinking water at the public supply well after 60 years 3 2 2 response time for water quality improvements under all alternative scenarios the rise in nitrate concentrations at the supply well continues for at least 5 years this is expected given the travel time between the source area and the supply well screen location in the aquifer fig 4 under the most aggressive scenario licwr regular concentrations begin to rapidly decrease after 2010 winter recharge in average and wet years only wr irregular is found to be the least aggressive scenario but even with this approach improvements over bau can be seen beginning in 2015 ten years after the scenario s initiation this lag time is at about the time at which the supply well exceeds the nitrate mcl in both bau and the wr irregular scenario fig 10 other scenarios have an intermediate lag time between 5 and 10 years before improvements begin stable steady nitrate concentrations in the public supply well are achieved only after a much longer period of time fig 10 ranging from three decades in the licwr regular scenario to nearly six decades in the licwr irregular scenario bau and wr irregular do not reach steady conditions within the simulation period 3 3 water quality improvements in ambient groundwater rural households outside community water supply boundaries typically rely on shallow domestic wells with low extraction rate 0 002 mcm per year the simulated scenarios offer significant insight on ambient groundwater quality relevant to these domestic wells for the analysis we consider the vertical nitrate profile throughout the capture zone of the public supply well we average nitrate concentration across all depth specific cells within the flow path zone emanating from the source area to the supply well this averaging process includes only those cells that intersect the flow paths between source area and well colored area in fig 11 top flow paths to the public supply well are located above the corcoran clay layer for the bau scenario nitrate concentration above this layer is much higher than underneath the corcoran clay highest bau concentrations are found near the water table concentrations decrease with depth implementation of alternative future scenarios significantly changes ambient nitrate distribution above this confining layer relative to bau wr irregular improves ambient groundwater in the shallow most groundwater within the upper 35 m on the other hand the wr regular scenario shows 20 more reduction of nitrate during the same period the comparison of wr irregular and wr regular scenarios reveals the importance of recharge frequency to groundwater quality improvement that is relevant to shallow domestic wells lic doubles the percentage of nitrate improvements within ambient groundwater consistent with the breakthrough curves at the supply well ambient groundwater quality improves most under licwr scenarios licwr regular scenario improved ambient groundwater quality by 60 after 60 years of application results confirm findings in similar groundwater modeling scenarios implemented for the alta irrigation district in the southern part of the central valley california luhdorff and scalmanini consulting engineers lsce and larry walker and associates lwa 2016 the study analyzed the application of selected practices including recharge nutrient management abandonment of agriculture and local pump and fertilize scenarios across the entire region not focused on the source area of wells surface restoration activities and nutrient management schemes were shown to improve the ambient groundwater quality in small geographic settings on farm recharge practices were shown to flush the root zone and move low quality shallow water to deeper zones of the aquifer also it was found that pump treat and reinject plans were not practicable for implementation across larger regions 1 km2 luhdorff and scalmanini consulting engineers lsce and larry walker and associates lwa 2016 king et al 2012 3 4 source area management and costs under the bau scenario the public supply well produces 69 mcm over the 60 scenario years 1 15 mcm year from a source area that extends over 400 ha 1000 acres 25 model cells that corresponds to an average bau scenario source area recharge rate of 0 29 m year nearly half of the source area 12 cells is in urban land use fig 4 eight cells 128 ha 320 acres are almond orchards and one cell 16 ha 40 acres is an alfalfa field the remainder of the area 4 cells is in pasture corn and beans winter recharge water wr scenarios was diverted to almond and alfalfa land use table 5 in the lic scenario almond land use was replaced by alfalfa improving nitrate mass loading to the water table in the lic wr scenarios the lic land use change to alfalfa also allows for additional recharge as alfalfa is more tolerant of winter irrigation the additional recharge to the system is lowest in the wr irregular scenario 9 5 mcm but 8 2 times larger in the highest recharge scenario licwr regular 78 mcm the difference in recharge between wr and licwr scenarios is about 2 5 fold over the 720 month scenario period 108 months were wet with floodwater available for the irregular scenarios the volume of water available for the regular scenarios is about 3 times larger than under the corresponding irregular winter recharge scenario the additional recharge water represents 14 46 33 and 113 of the public supply well pumping rate for the wr irregular wr regular licwr irregular and licwr regular scenario respectively the economic feasibility of the alternative scenarios is driven by the cost of additional winter recharge operations and the net cost of land use conversion to alfalfa or other low nitrogen intensity crops current irrigation water rates in the area vary from 0 0016 m3 to 0 032 m3 http www mid org water irrigation allocation html compared to at least 0 50 m3 for domestic water charged by community water suppliers https www ci ceres ca us documentcenter view 2192 water rate and connection fee update for the scenario supplying the largest amount of water licwr regular the cost of the additional recharge water 113 of the water pumped at the public supply well would therefore be as much as 7 of the current cost to public water supply users 1 13 0 032 0 50 assuming that the cost of winter recharge water is equal to the highest current irrigation water rate including any operational and permitting expenditures land use conversion from almond orchard to alfalfa requires up front investments and more importantly will lead to decreased production income mayzelle et al 2015 the initial cost to establish an alfalfa field is relatively small at 3140 ha frate et al 2008 while net total economic losses are on the order of 8000 ha year due to the much lower net profit from alfalfa production when compared to almond production mayzelle et al 2015 the cost of the conversion of 128 ha of almond orchard to alfalfa would be equivalent to 0 90 m3 of water produced at the public supply well assuming that the additional cost would be born by the supply well utility this would bring costs within the range of typical surface water based drinking water supply in california california public utilities commission 2016 the cost analysis for the lic and lic wr scenarios using alfalfa is likely a worst cost case it does not account for flood risk reduction benefits which may outweigh these costs and it does not consider more valuable alternative low nitrogen intensity crops including improved nitrogen management in the almond orchard or conversion to vineyard landuse mayzelle et al 2015 conversion of the almond orchard to wine grape vineyard a crop that has similar low nitrate mass losses to groundwater as alfalfa is suitable for winter recharge and grown commonly in the area and would likely erase production losses over the current almond production california department of food and agriculture 2017 however establishing the vineyard is expensive on the order of 40 000 ha verdegaal et al 2012 when spreading this cost over 20 years for the 128 ha of current almond orchard this amounts to 0 22 m3 of water pumped from the public supply well the cost is significantly lower than the conversion to alfalfa but much higher than regular winter recharge the costs compare favorably to well head treatment another alternative available to the public supply well operator ion exchange treatment for nitrate is a common approach with total costs in the range from 0 19 to 0 57 m3 jensen et al 2014 another source area management alternative foregoing both conversion cost and profit losses would be to implement rigorous nutrient management in the almond orchards within the source area given the high nitrogen input to almond orchards it may be difficult to achieve n losses not exceeding 30 kg n ha yr at the water table even under very efficient management practices however lic scenario results indicate that nitrate concentrations at the public supply well would stabilize below the mcl even if nitrate leaching under the almond orchard is twice the amount simulated that is 60 kg n ha yr which is still far less than under the bau scenario adding wr to such nutrient management in the source area would provide further relief and additional insurance for keeping water quality in the supply well below the mcl over the long term 3 5 implications for region wide groundwater quality protection our findings can be used at regional or state scale for nitrate removal plans the total number of community water systems in california that rely on groundwater as a primary source of drinking water is around 2584 which use 8396 active wells serving 4 1 million people department of water resources 2013 many of these groundwater reliant community water systems are in rural areas throughout the state state water resources control board 2013 nitrate was detected above mcl in 451 wells associated with 205 community water systems dwr 2013 therefore approximately 8 of community water systems in california have nitrate problem swrcb 2017 which serve drinking water to 328 000 people state wide many of them in the central valley the water supplied to these communities is treated and delivered at a cost typically on the order of 0 30 0 60 m3 honeycutt et al 2012 if we assume a per capita water consumption of 0 7 m3 d mount et al 2014 total groundwater pumping in these wells is on the order of 84 mcm yr if addressed through source area management including winter recharge the case study presented here suggests that recharging nearly the same amount of water pumped under the licwr regular scenario provides significant groundwater quality improvements statewide that amounts to 84 mcm per year of winter recharge focused in the source area of at risk public supply wells as the number of community water supply systems that will exceed the nitrate mcl will likely rise significantly over the next twenty years honeycutt et al 2012 the need for such recharge may increase to as much as 200 mcm for comparison the estimated amount of unused flood water available in the central valley during an average or wet year is 3200 mcm kocis and dahlke 2017 a significant fraction of the amount of flood water available for recharge may be needed to implement wr or lic wr type scenarios as long term alternatives to drinking water treatment on the other hand winter recharge would not suffice to address much of the domestic well water pollution due to the wide spread occurrence of domestic wells and high nitrate groundwater concentration ransom et al 2017 3 6 limitations and uncertainties through the process of developing the flow and transport simulations presented in this study some conceptual assumptions and a set of numerical parameters were used which are sources of uncertainty in the expected nitrate concentration values while the underlying transient flow model was informed by detailed hydrogeologic architecture data and calibrated against measured water levels and stream flows phillips et al 2015 and while modeled nitrate concentrations and trends agree with measured data in the region for 1960 to 2005 the transport model does not reflect some source and aquifer variability affecting measured nitrate in wells section 3 1 hydraulic properties porosity and hence pore water velocities are among the most variable and uncertain parameters resulting in uncertainty about travel time but also about the exact location of the source area henri and harter 2019 despite the significant amount of aquifer heterogeneity captured by the underlying geologic framework historic and current nitrate loading is based on published land use maps statistics and reported average nutrient management practices and average harvest rates soil nitrogen accumulation local denitrification and other processes may significantly affect the actual nitrate leaching rate ransom et al 2018 developed n loading estimates based on groundwater nitrate measurements confirming the overall magnitude of groundwater nitrate loading used here but also demonstrating that rates vary widely and may be lower for nut crops than estimates based on field n surplus for actual project implementation this will require improved hydrogeologic characterization of the likely source area of a supply well or alternatively the designation of a larger source area zone within which targeted management practices are applied monitoring of water quality near the source zone would provide early confirmation of potential improvements in water quality unsaturated zone travel time complex root zone processes including denitrification n mineralization n uptake into soil organic matter may vary widely within the central valley or other agricultural regions with similar climatic and hydrogeologic conditions unsaturated zone travel time may be particularly long in semi arid regions with highly efficient irrigation systems minimal annual recharge rates much smaller than 300 mm and in regions with deep vadose zones 20 m harter et al 2005 on the other hand there is significant evidence for preferential flow and rapid vadose zone transport under irrigation botros et al 2011 turkeltaub et al 2014 under certain climate and soil conditions fertilizer n undergoes significant storage in the soil carbon pool sebilo et al 2013 and increase n storage in the root zone geisseler and scow 2014 before being released in the central valley therefore considering unsaturated variations to the simulations could increase the modeled nitrate values and lengthen the response time in the system here soil and deep vadose zone denitrification processes were considered by assuming a 10 loss of the n surplus prior to recharge harter et al 2017 groundwater denitrification was neglected thus leading to conservatively high concentration predictions for the early time predictions 2005 2020 actual denitrification rates in the oxic aquifer system are typically sufficiently small enough to not justify the assumptions longer transport may in fact be significantly affected by denitrification especially when transport occurs through the clayey fractions of the alluvial aquifer system architecture mcmahon et al 2008 this work also neglected seasonal variations in nitrate loading and relied on an average annualized loss rate under the mediterranean climate conditions in the central valley leaching losses during the growing season are largely controlled by irrigation efficient water and nutrient management practices may lead to minimal water and nitrogen losses during the growing season even in crops with high n demand if properly managed baram et al 2016 residual nitrogen remaining after harvest is subject to root zone flushing by winter rains a major source of recharge under effective management under more traditional bau management practices significant recharge occurs during the growing season combined with n losses occur due to irrigation nonuniformity and low irrigation efficiency alva et al 2006 while these seasonal and daily dynamics significantly affect leaching of nitrate applying an annualized average nitrate leaching rate was considered appropriate here not only because of the lack of more detailed input data but also because of the mixing of water of a range of age in supply wells additional research is needed to better understand this assumption on nitrate dynamics in water supply wells of interest the study here focuses on a proof of concept and on the overall qualitative outcome of wr and lic type management scenarios in the source area of public and domestic water supply wells the study findings relative to the bau scenario are significant despite the uncertainties about site specific conditions to the degree that the setting is typical of many semi arid irrigate agricultural systems overlying unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer systems in mediterranean climates the findings here generally apply not only to the central valley but to regions around the globe although time and spatial scales will vary depending on site conditions 4 conclusions in this study the numerical modeling approach was used to assess changes in nitrate concentration of a public supply well and in ambient groundwater due to implementation of protective agricultural practices in the well s source area the conceptual scenarios include increasing recharge and decreasing nitrate mass load to groundwater simulated breakthrough curves at the public supply well and profile distributions of nitrate in the capture zone indicate that the by far most aggressive management practice is to apply both techniques simultaneously alva et al 2006 achieve lower nitrate losses in the source area by replacing high nitrogen demand crops with low nitrate leaching crops e g alfalfa or vineyards or by aggressive nutrient management improvements and bachand et al 2014 add more clean water to the source area by diverting stored floodwater to fields suitable for winter recharge ag mar in the source area this scenario licwr regular was found to achieve the quickest and most reliable results first improvements were obtained in the public supply wells within less than a decade and full attenuation was achieved within 40 years nitrate levels were 80 lower than under the bau scenario in 2065 in the study area analyzed here other scenarios some involving low nitrate mass loading to groundwater only lic some focused on winter recharge only wr were able to reverse the trend of increasing nitrate and stabilizing nitrate concentrations at levels below the mcl wr scenarios led to a slight increase in nitrate prior to nitrate improvements being observed in the public supply well this was due to the faster travel of legacy nitrate in groundwater following an increase in hydraulic head gradients due to the recharge the two scenarios that failed to provide safe drinking water are the bau scenario and a winter recharge scenario that relies on the highly irregular occurrence of flood water wr irregular at the study site the latter scenario provided relative improvements to the bau with respect to nitrate concentrations in the supply well but not sufficient to meet regulatory requirements aggressive nitrate mass reduction was here achieved by replacing current high nitrate leaching crops almond orchards with alfalfa or wine grape vineyards both of which have low n fertilizer requirements and can be managed to low nitrate leaching losses changing lands to alfalfa or vineyard has two benefits alva et al 2006 it increases the capacity of lands to tolerate extra water and therefore allows for more winter recharge than the almond orchard bachand et al 2014 it decreases the leaching mass of nitrate to groundwater combining nutrient management even in a high fertilizer use crop like almonds with winter recharge may provide sufficient improvements in groundwater quality within the source area to meet water quality at the public supply well after an initial lag time given the cost of recharge water assuming that it does not exceed current high end rates in the study region regular winter recharge would be the most affordable option adding 10 to current water rates of groundwater dependent community water system users given that almonds make up about one third of the source area land use conversion of these orchards to alfalfa would significantly improve long term water quality at the public supply well but at costs that are at or above alternative treatment costs due to the loss in economic productivity converting to higher value low nitrogen emitting crops such as vineyards may economically be more advantageous than well head treatment in the long term despite significant conversion costs a combination of significantly improved nutrient management in the almond orchards and winter recharge may also represent a promising less costly alternative to achieving good water quality in the water supply well these results provide promising alternatives to well head treatment and other technical solutions at least for achieving long term results or to prevent further degradation where nitrate levels do not already exceed the mcl results are scalable to the entire region given the similar climate and the overall water supply conditions this study does not address additional questions regarding the ability to store and redistribute available flood water in the central valley to source areas on a regular if not continuous basis further work is also needed to identify incentive programs that public water supply agencies may pursue in their source areas in collaboration with growers and grower organizations to incentivize appropriate land use

1563,an understanding of nanoparticle interactions with solid surfaces in unsaturated porous media is important both for understanding nanoparticle fate in the environment and for the design of environmental applications that depend on the delivery of nanoparticles while surface chemical interactions can have a strong influence on nanomaterial attachment to surfaces in environmental porous media the hydraulics of water flow can also play an important role in attachment in the unsaturated zone naturally occurring evaporation is a major source of water flow the purpose of this work was to examine how evaporation induced water flow at the pore scale impacts the transport and deposition of negatively charged sulfate modified polystyrene nanoparticles evaporation experiments were conducted by initially saturating small clusters of sand grains with a suspension of nanoparticles confocal microscopy was then used to track the changing water surface profile as well as to track the transport and deposition of nanoparticles in the grain clusters confocal data showed that nanoparticles tended to deposit on sand grains near the receding air water interface an expected behavior this process led to attachment on grain surfaces as they were exposed by the receding interface evaporation was found to produce complex flow patterns with temporally changing flow directions at the pore scale a finite difference model developed to explore the link between evaporation and water flow in pore spaces was able to duplicate many of the observed phenomena simulations suggest that distinct differences in deposition mechanisms should be expected for porous media undergoing evaporation compared with porous media experiencing drainage graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

fields such as electronics medicine imaging and drug delivery as well as for terrestrial applications such as agriculture and environmental remediation khot et al 2012 rai et al 2016 rai et al 2015 sun et al 2008 yan and melosh 2016 the high likelihood that nanomaterials will enter the environment either through manufacturing releases or directly during their use e g in agricultural or remediation applications means that they have the potential to pose risk to the environment and human health wiesner et al 2006 in addition to risks posed by nanomaterials themselves mobile nanomaterials and other colloids may also influence the mobility of organic contaminants or heavy metals creating an additional source of risk cheng et al 2005 as such a quantitative understanding of the environmental fate of nanomaterials is essential for environment protection and for the sustainability of nanotechnology furthermore a quantitative understanding of nanomaterial transport at the pore scale is important for environmental remediation applications that require controlled delivery of nanoparticles in the subsurface the transport and deposition of nanoparticles in porous media have been widely studied ben moshe et al 2010 chen and kibbey 2008 wang et al 2006 wang et al 2016 as is the case with other types of colloids collision and attachment to solid surfaces are major phenomena controlling the deposition of nanoparticles in porous media so nanoparticles can be retained by porous media when they intercept solid surfaces provided that surface thermodynamics favor attachment christian et al 2008 elimelech and omelia 1990 mcdowell boyer et al 1986 higher attachment is typically observed under conditions where nanoparticles and solid surfaces have opposite surface charges and under conditions of high ionic strength chen et al 2010 wang et al 2016 in saturated porous media nanoparticle retention can be caused by aggregation and sedimentation as well as pore straining chen et al 2011 fang et al 2013 petosa et al 2010 solovitch et al 2010 in unsaturated porous media additional attachment mechanisms are possible including attachment to air water interfaces or straining by water films chen and kibbey 2008 chen et al 2008 flury and aramrak 2017 although the thermodynamics of interactions between nanomaterials and solid surfaces can play a central role in deposition of nanoparticles during transport hydraulics is also important for example slower flow in both saturated and unsaturated porous media is almost always observed to yield greater retention e g chen et al 2008 lecoanet and wiesner 2004 in addition nanoparticles have been observed to be retained in unsaturated media undergoing drainage even under conditions where the surface and solution properties favor high mobility and where attachment is not observed in saturated flow experiments under the same conditions chen et al 2010 hoggan et al 2016 a result that suggests that changing water contents may play an important role in retention near the ground surface environmental porous media are constantly experiencing changing water contents as a result of rainfall infiltration changing water table levels drainage and redistribution furthermore evaporation of porewater is ubiquitous near the ground surface and is known to induce net porewater flow towards the ground surface e g brutsaert 2014 daamen and simmonds 1996 hanks et al 1967 while evaporation has been linked to potential impacts on the transport of dissolved solutes e g normile et al 2017 little is known about its potential impact on transport and deposition of nanoparticles in the unsaturated zone the objective of this work was to explore the effect of evaporation on water flow at the pore scale with emphasis on understanding its effect on the transport and deposition of nanoparticles confocal microscopy was used to study the flow of water and deposition of fluorescent nanoparticles on sand grain surfaces in a cluster of sand grains undergoing evaporation and numerical simulations were used to interpret the observed results 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the nanomaterials used in this work were fluorescent red sulfate modified polystyrene latex nanospheres the nanospheres were purchased in a 2 5 suspension from sigma aldrich st louis mo and have a manufacturer reported size of 100 nm all experiments were conducted with a suspension with a nanosphere concentration of 2 5 mg l the suspension was prepared in nanopure water barnstead dubuque ia with fluorescein sodium added to allow simultaneous imaging of the water in pore spaces zeta potential of the nanospheres in suspension with fluorescein was measured using a nicomp 380 zls particle sizing systems port richey fl dynamic light scattering zeta potential analyzer and found to be 36 3 0 9 mv under the conditions used in the work sulfate modified polystyrene nanospheres were selected for the work because sand grains have negative surface charges under most natural ph conditions ph greater than approx 2 so electrostatics do not favor attachment of the nanospheres to sand surfaces this allows for study of how evaporation induced flow patterns influence nanoparticle behavior in the absence of surface chemical conditions favorable to attachment making the work relevant to understanding the fate of other highly mobile nanoparticles in unsaturated media the unconsolidated porous medium used for this work was created from clusters of u s silica f 45 sand a high purity natural sand with a measured mean grain size of 323 μm kibbey and chen 2012 2 2 imaging and image processing imaging for this work was conducted using a leica buffalo grove il sp 8 confocal microscope confocal microscopy uses specialized laser optics to collect only in focus light allowing for imaging to be conducted as a function of depth yielding three dimensional information about the sample imaging was conducted in resonance mode to allow rapid scanning with depth clusters of sand grains were created on microscope slides by first placing a thin layer of epoxy on the slides and then gently pouring sand grains onto the slide the resulting clusters contained several hundred individual grains and were typically several grains deep note that only grains in the lowest level of the clusters were attached to the slide with the epoxy the upper layers rested on the lower layers which served to hold upper grains in place experiments were conducted in the top layers of clusters and involved placing a drop of nanosphere suspension on the cluster and then imaging as the suspension evaporated imaging was conducted using the 488 nm line of the argon laser for excitation of the fluorescein and 561 nm diode pumped solid state dpss laser for excitation of the nanoparticles a 10 magnification 0 3 aperture dry objective was used for all imaging two systems were studied for this work specific details of the systems studied are discussed in the results and discussion in the context of the experimental results however the imaged region for each experiment contained between one and two million voxels and had dimensions in each direction less than 1 mm a small fraction of the total cluster dimension imaging was conducted at intervals of several seconds confocal data were processed using fiji a variant of imagej schindelin et al 2012 schneider et al 2012 and the imaris software package bitplane zurich switzerland 2 3 numerical simulation a two dimensional numerical simulation was used to explore how evaporation induces flow in grain clusters because the imaged regions covered only a small portion of the experimental grain clusters and significant evaporation and flow occurred outside of the imaged regions it was not possible to determine boundary conditions for the imaged region from the experimental data as such simulations were used to explore flow in computer generated synthetic systems simulations were based on a quasi static flow model used previously by the authors to study flow and transport during evaporation on individual grain surfaces adegbule et al 2018 the model is based on the recognition that evaporation of capillary held water films is accompanied by an increase in capillary pressure the model simulates the changing capillary held film configuration with increasing capillary pressure and then uses water mass balances to evaluate the flow needed to reconcile differences in the spatial distribution of evaporation from the surface between capillary pressure steps and the film thicknesses dictated by capillary pressure theoretical capillary held water film configurations are calculated by solving the young laplace equation for incrementally increasing capillary pressures using the algorithm described by previously by kibbey 2013 the algorithm uses an iterative approach to calculate the changing contact line positions as films recede a zero slope boundary condition was used for all calculations in this work water film configurations were calculated for capillary pressures from 0 1 to 0 3 cm water at 0 1 cm intervals from 0 3 to 1 5 cm water at 0 2 cm intervals from 1 5 to 3 0 cm water at 0 3 cm intervals and from 3 0 to 6 0 cm water at 0 5 cm intervals smaller intervals were used at lower capillary pressures because air water interface shape varies more with capillary pressure at lower capillary pressures it should be noted that the exact details of steps used don t influence the observed trends the evaporation for all water surfaces is taken to be spatially uniform as dictated by the langmuir evaporation equation as such the total water evaporated between each capillary pressure step is distributed uniformly across the water surface and then mass balance is used to calculate the change in water mass at each point in space between capillary pressure steps eq 1 adegbule et al 2018 1 m i j c 1 m i 1 j m i 1 j m i j 1 m i j 1 m i j e m i j c 2 where m i j c 1 and m i j c 2 are the masses of water at point i j at capillary pressure c 1 and c 2 m i j e is the evaporated mass of water at point i j from capillary pressure c 1 to c 2 m i 1 j 1 is the mass of water transferred between point i 1 j 1 and point i j from capillary pressure c 1 to c 2 because of the small size of the simulated region flow is assumed to be laminar and viscosity and film thickness dictates the resistance to flow between any two points the series of equations described by eq 1 are solved implicitly at each capillary pressure step for this work no flow boundaries are used around the outside of the simulated region additional calculations with the model were used to explore differences in water flux resulting from evaporation and drainage in a simplified 1d system 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows two representations of the grain configuration in one of the two grain cluster regions studied in this work system 1 fig 1a shows a top projection in the x y plane from the confocal data the image is a reversed image of the fluorescein channel where the intensities in the z direction are summed reversing the image means that the parts of the image with the longest path lengths through the fluorescein are darkest meaning that the bright portions of the image correspond to individual sand grains with the brightest grains having the highest top surface elevations fig 1b is a three dimensional rendering of the grain top surface from the same data note that grains themselves are opaque so imaging can only be conducted in pore space above grains as such the grain configuration below the visible portion is unknown the imaged region has horizontal dimensions of 661 μm 661 μm and an imaged depth of 454 μm corresponding to 128 x 128 y 106 z voxels with individual voxel dimensions of 5 16 μm x 5 16 μm y 4 28 μm z the imaged region shows portions of between 9 and 12 individual small sand grains imaging was conducted for this system at 9 24 s intervals fig 2 shows three dimensional images generated from the confocal volume data at nine different times as evaporation progresses note that a video corresponding to the system shown in fig 2 is included in the accompanying online supplementary material the numbers by the individual images correspond to minutes since the start of the experiment the images are created from the nanosphere fluorescence channel of the confocal data e g 561 nm excitation wavelength in the color map used for the rendering shown to the right of the figure fluorescence is rendered on a scale ranging through black red yellow and white with higher fluorescence shown as brighter colors e g yellow white because the individual nanoparticles are smaller than voxel dimensions individual nanoparticles can t be resolved with confocal imaging in these systems however cumulative fluorescence in each voxel is detected so rendered color is an indication of nanoparticle concentration with brighter colors corresponding to higher concentrations that means the method can detect the nanoparticle suspension e g the contours of the water surface and water grain interfaces as well as higher concentrations of accumulated nanoparticles both on sand grains and where suspended nanoparticle aggregates are present at early times in fig 2 nanoparticle suspension occupies the water in the spaces around the soil grains although some individual nanoparticle aggregates are visible in the pore space especially apparent in the accompanying video where their motion can be observed the distribution of nanoparticles in the suspension is relatively uniform as time progresses evaporation continues and the water surface drops gradually exposing the tops of sand grains as the grains are exposed the exposed portions are bright indicating high fluorescence and correspondingly a high concentration of retained nanoparticles on the exposed portions of the grains by 12 min portions of the top surfaces of four of the highest elevation grains are visible while by 17 6 min the tops of 6 grains are visible as the water recedes up through 17 6 min it can be seen that porewater fluorescence increases indicating that in addition to causing deposition on grain surfaces evaporation is increasing the nanoparticle concentration of the suspension finally at 23 1 min most of the porewater from the imaged region has evaporated leaving deposited nanoparticles on the surfaces of all of the grains present before discussing the behavior of system 1 further it is useful to first explore expected flow behaviors in a simulated system experiencing evaporation as a basis for discussion of observed behaviors fig 3 shows six different three dimensional views of the calculated evaporation driven flow in a synthetic cluster at different capillary pressures the simulated region is 512 μm 512 μm with a maximum height of 256 μm so is similar in size to the imaged regions studied in confocal data in this work the synthetic cluster consists of one high grain surface front left and one low grain surface rear right because the model is a 2d model the grains are approximated as mounds to provide a smooth elevation map in the form z f x y the water surfaces shown correspond to each capillary pressure while the vectors show the calculated flow directions between the previous i e lower and current simulated capillary pressure steps two major phenomena are observable in the simulation 1 flow towards contact lines and 2 complex larger scale flow patterns that exhibit flow in pores first towards newly exposed high elevation surfaces and then later away from them as other newly formed lower elevation contact lines influence the bulk flow at a capillary pressure of 0 2 cm water upper left subfigure only the front left grain surface protrudes from the water while the rear right grain is fully submerged note that the flow directions are towards the contact line of the front left grain in the 0 2 cm water subfigure after 0 5 cm upper right subfigure when portions of both grains become exposed flow directions are from the bulk towards the contact lines for both grains note that this is true even in the 2 7 and 4 0 cm cases bottom row where although the large arrows appear to flow past the front left grain towards the rear right grain close examination of the data shows net inflow of water to grid cells adjacent to contact lines on both grains this is not visible in the figures because of the small magnitude of flow towards contact lines in those regions compared with rapid flow past the grains note also in the 2 7 and 4 0 cm cases that contact lines are evident where the water has receded from the bottom surface of the simulated region in the front right and rear left flow also occurs towards these contact lines the results of these simulations support the frequently observed behavior of suspended colloids and nanoparticles accumulating on grain surfaces near contact lines in part as a result of convective flow towards contact lines e g dathe et al 2014 flury and aramrak 2017 zevi et al 2006 wan and tokunaga 2005 correctly identified the source of this behavior as a phenomenon referred to as the coffee ring effect where evaporation drives flow and advection to the perimeter of an evaporating drop because of flow required to reconcile the spatial distribution of evaporation with the constraints of capillarity on interface shape adegbule et al 2018 deegan et al 1997 the effect is named because it can result in a ring of precipitates or deposited particles at the perimeter of an evaporating drop although flow directly adjacent to grains is towards the contact lines at a slightly larger scale the coffee ring effect can create extremely complex flow patterns that change throughout the course of evaporation a phenomenon that could potentially influence the extent of mixing at the pore scale for example at low capillary pressures in the simulation fig 3 the bulk flow is generally from the rear right to the front left while at higher capillary pressures it is from the front left to rear right in general flow is observed towards higher elevation surfaces as they initially protrude from the water surface as the water level continues to drop other emerging surfaces dominate the flow causing flow to change directions as will be discussed in a subsequent paragraph this phenomenon is also observable in the experimental data collected for this work while flow in pores can change directions throughout evaporation the fact that flow near grain surfaces is towards contact lines means that particles being carried past grains by evaporation driven flow may be drawn towards surfaces and intercepted fig 4 shows an experimental system system 2 that illustrates this phenomenon the imaged region has horizontal dimensions of 671 μm 671 μm and an imaged depth of 347 μm corresponding to 128 x 128 y 81 z voxels with individual voxel dimensions of 5 24 μm x 5 24 μm y 4 28 μm z the three dimensional images in fig 4 were generated from confocal volume data at nine different times as evaporation progresses using the same settings as used in fig 2 the color map for fig 4 is also the same as that used in fig 2 note that a video corresponding to the system shown in fig 4 is included in the accompanying online supplementary material while system 1 fig 2 explored behavior in a cluster of small grains the imaged region for system 2 fig 4 shows one large grain approx 530 600 μm just to the right of center and portions of three other grains imaging was conducted for this system at 3 71 s intervals of interest in fig 4 are two different nanoparticle aggregates that are carried into the imaged area from the front left and deposited on the large grain as the water surface recedes with evaporation the upper six subfigures track the two aggregates indicated with white circles numbers in the subfigures correspond to time in minutes since the start of the experiment paths followed by the aggregates over the imaged duration are shown in the final 12 6 min image the plot at the bottom of the figure shows the top projected velocity for the two aggregates and also indicates the times of image subfigures in red symbols on the time axis note that the two aggregates are initially transported rapidly towards the rear right but then as the water begins to recede from the grain around 5 min their paths turn to the right towards the grain and they are intercepted by the grain surface at the receding contact line after approx 6 min the aggregates are essentially immobilized on the grain surface this behavior is consistent with the existence of local evaporation induced flow towards receding contact lines while the potential importance of contact lines in the deposition of colloids and nanoparticles is widely recognized it is important to emphasize that convective flow towards contact lines is something that can only result from evaporation at the pore scale and not from other behaviors that cause changing water contents fig 5 uses the same numerical model from fig 3 to simulate water motion resulting from evaporation a and drainage b from an interface pinned to a sharp ridge the upper right corner of each subfigure it should be noted that a pinned contact line is not required to create the behavior illustrated in the figure but it simplifies the illustration the simulations correspond to a cylindrical air water interface i e infinite radius of curvature in the direction not shown in the figure as might be observed adjacent to a long straight ridge the dimensions of the simulated region are 100 μm in the x direction and 70 μm in the z direction in the case of evaporation water is assumed to leave the system uniformly over the surface while in the case of drainage water is assumed to flow out from the left boundary in all cases the slope at the left of the simulation is set to zero and water configuration is calculated to increase in 2 cm capillary pressure steps as shown note that because of the cylindrical interfaces all water surfaces in the figure have cross sections that are portions of circles red arrows in the figure indicate how water leaves the system e g evaporation in a drainage in b while blue arrows in the figure show the calculated water volumetric flux required to move between capillary pressure steps subject to the defined boundary conditions in the case of evaporation fig 5a increasing capillary pressures create advective flow towards the contact line while in the case of drainage fig 5b increasing capillary pressures create advective flow away from the contact line that means that behavior such as that observed in fig 4 system 2 i e colloids being drawn towards a contact line as they flow past could only result from evaporation while other sources of interface motion such as drainage can potentially trap colloids and nanoparticles at contact lines the behavior does not result from convective flow towards contact lines fig 6 illustrates the complex larger scale flow patterns that result from evaporation in system 1 figs 1 and 2 red arrows correspond to specific manually identified suspended aggregates of nanospheres arrow tails begin at the position of the aggregate in each image shown while the arrow head position corresponds to the aggregate location in the next frame 9 24 s after the frame shown note that at early times flow is towards the back of the cluster the top of the image where high grain surfaces are present as evaporation proceeds flow directions change repeatedly influenced not only by the grains present in the image but also by grains outside of the imaged area at late times rapid flow is observed towards the front right of the cluster note that this behavior is quite evident in the accompanying video in the online supplementary material while figs 2 and 6 clearly indicate the accumulation of nanoparticles on grain surfaces and the complex changing flow patterns that accompany evaporation they do not provide insight into what is happening below the air water interface figs 7 and 8 show fluorescence from two different vertical planes slicing through the data in each figure the upper left subfigure shows the location of the slice the red dashed line and the direction from which it is viewed the red arrow the remaining subfigures in each figure correspond to the same times shown in all but the first subfigure in fig 2 note that because figs 7 and 8 only show fluorescence in the imaged slice rather than a sum brightness in figs 7 and 8 is a direct indicator of nanoparticle concentration in both figures it is possible to see the receding water level with increasing time furthermore it is apparent that the porewater concentration of nanoparticles increases with time as water evaporates as evidenced by the imaged porewater color changing from blue to green with increasing time this effect is evident in both figures and can be observed by comparing the porewater at time 3 7 min to that at 17 6 min another interesting feature that can be observed in figs 7 and 8 is accumulation of nanoparticles in the vicinity of the air water interface as water evaporates the effect is particularly noticeable at 12 0 and 14 8 min in the figures as evidenced by the bright green at the interface this behavior likely indicates that the water evaporation causes the interface to recede more rapidly than the nanoparticles are able to diffuse away from the interface and into the bulk note that the enhanced concentration near the air water interface extends over a depth of as much as 50 μm approx 500 particle diameters so is not the result of adsorption at the air water interface because these nanoparticles are hydrophilic and negatively charged significant adsorption at the air water interface wouldn t be expected in any case the fact that this behavior occurs suggests that any mixing that accompanies the complex temporally varying evaporation driven flow patterns fig 6 may be primarily in the horizontal direction in this system and thus not sufficient to cause significant mixing of suspended nanoparticles in the direction perpendicular to the air water interface the resulting increased concentrations near the air water interface may further enhance their retention at contact lines also apparent in figs 7 and 8 is that the accumulation on grain surfaces only happens as the receding water surface exposes grains accumulation is not evident below the water surface this is apparent from the bright spots that appear at high points on grain surfaces as the water surface recedes for example in fig 7 at 12 0 and 14 8 min bright spots i e accumulated nanoparticles appear at the top of the rightmost grain as the water continues to recede bright spots are visible at the tops of both the left and right grains by 20 3 min similarly in fig 8 accumulation is evident at the peaks of highest grains as they are exposed by the receding air water interface note that accumulation is greatest in regions where the air water interface is receding slowly giving nanoparticles time to be transported to the contact line for example in fig 7 the air water interface only gradually recedes from the high point on the left for the first 17 6 min leading to significant accumulation on top of the grain then over the next 2 7 min the interface rapidly sweeps downward past the steep portion of the grain resulting in little accumulation on the side of the grain by 23 1 min most of the remaining water has either evaporated or flowed out of the imaged region yielding little additional accumulation it should be noted that while accumulation of nanoparticles is observed on grain surfaces as air water interfaces recede accumulation is not evident in the water below the interface in any of the images this observation is consistent with a lack of affinity between the negatively charged nanoparticles and the negatively charged sand grain surfaces and further indicates that the accumulation on grain surfaces during evaporation in this system results from the hydraulics of evaporation induced flow 4 conclusions the results of this work show that pore water flow induced by evaporation can lead to deposition of suspended nanoparticles even in cases where attachment is not favorable simulations support the idea that flow occurs to balance the spatial distribution of evaporation with the interface shape requirements dictated by capillary pressure a phenomenon known as the coffee ring effect close to grain surfaces flow occurs towards contact lines producing a driving force for deposition of nanoparticles in the pore spaces farther from grains however the flow resulting from evaporation can exhibit complex temporally changing patterns in general flow is observed towards higher elevation grain surfaces as they protrude from the air water surface as time progresses and water recedes flow towards newly emerging grains dominates the net flow patterns while both evaporation and drainage can potentially produce similarly complex pore scale flow patterns simulations suggest that only flow induced by evaporation will produce convective flow towards contact lines this means that although trapping of colloids and nanoparticles by moving contact lines may still occur during drainage the mechanisms of retention during evaporation are likely different the results of this work have implications for understanding the movement and deposition of nanoparticles and other colloids not only in the unsaturated zone but also potentially in any multiphase system where changing phase volumes e g through dissolution or evaporation create pore scale flow gradients the following are the supplementary data related to

transport and deposition of nanoparticles in the grain clusters confocal data showed that nanoparticles tended to deposit on sand grains near the receding air water interface an expected behavior this process led to attachment on grain surfaces as they were exposed by the receding interface evaporation was found to produce complex flow patterns with temporally changing flow directions at the pore scale a finite difference model developed to explore the link between evaporation and water flow in pore spaces was able to duplicate many of the observed phenomena simulations suggest that distinct differences in deposition mechanisms should be expected for porous media undergoing evaporation compared with porous media experiencing drainage graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

fields such as electronics medicine imaging and drug delivery as well as for terrestrial applications such as agriculture and environmental remediation khot et al 2012 rai et al 2016 rai et al 2015 sun et al 2008 yan and melosh 2016 the high likelihood that nanomaterials will enter the environment either through manufacturing releases or directly during their use e g in agricultural or remediation applications means that they have the potential to pose risk to the environment and human health wiesner et al 2006 in addition to risks posed by nanomaterials themselves mobile nanomaterials and other colloids may also influence the mobility of organic contaminants or heavy metals creating an additional source of risk cheng et al 2005 as such a quantitative understanding of the environmental fate of nanomaterials is essential for environment protection and for the sustainability of nanotechnology furthermore a quantitative understanding of nanomaterial transport at the pore scale is important for environmental remediation applications that require controlled delivery of nanoparticles in the subsurface the transport and deposition of nanoparticles in porous media have been widely studied ben moshe et al 2010 chen and kibbey 2008 wang et al 2006 wang et al 2016 as is the case with other types of colloids collision and attachment to solid surfaces are major phenomena controlling the deposition of nanoparticles in porous media so nanoparticles can be retained by porous media when they intercept solid surfaces provided that surface thermodynamics favor attachment christian et al 2008 elimelech and omelia 1990 mcdowell boyer et al 1986 higher attachment is typically observed under conditions where nanoparticles and solid surfaces have opposite surface charges and under conditions of high ionic strength chen et al 2010 wang et al 2016 in saturated porous media nanoparticle retention can be caused by aggregation and sedimentation as well as pore straining chen et al 2011 fang et al 2013 petosa et al 2010 solovitch et al 2010 in unsaturated porous media additional attachment mechanisms are possible including attachment to air water interfaces or straining by water films chen and kibbey 2008 chen et al 2008 flury and aramrak 2017 although the thermodynamics of interactions between nanomaterials and solid surfaces can play a central role in deposition of nanoparticles during transport hydraulics is also important for example slower flow in both saturated and unsaturated porous media is almost always observed to yield greater retention e g chen et al 2008 lecoanet and wiesner 2004 in addition nanoparticles have been observed to be retained in unsaturated media undergoing drainage even under conditions where the surface and solution properties favor high mobility and where attachment is not observed in saturated flow experiments under the same conditions chen et al 2010 hoggan et al 2016 a result that suggests that changing water contents may play an important role in retention near the ground surface environmental porous media are constantly experiencing changing water contents as a result of rainfall infiltration changing water table levels drainage and redistribution furthermore evaporation of porewater is ubiquitous near the ground surface and is known to induce net porewater flow towards the ground surface e g brutsaert 2014 daamen and simmonds 1996 hanks et al 1967 while evaporation has been linked to potential impacts on the transport of dissolved solutes e g normile et al 2017 little is known about its potential impact on transport and deposition of nanoparticles in the unsaturated zone the objective of this work was to explore the effect of evaporation on water flow at the pore scale with emphasis on understanding its effect on the transport and deposition of nanoparticles confocal microscopy was used to study the flow of water and deposition of fluorescent nanoparticles on sand grain surfaces in a cluster of sand grains undergoing evaporation and numerical simulations were used to interpret the observed results 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the nanomaterials used in this work were fluorescent red sulfate modified polystyrene latex nanospheres the nanospheres were purchased in a 2 5 suspension from sigma aldrich st louis mo and have a manufacturer reported size of 100 nm all experiments were conducted with a suspension with a nanosphere concentration of 2 5 mg l the suspension was prepared in nanopure water barnstead dubuque ia with fluorescein sodium added to allow simultaneous imaging of the water in pore spaces zeta potential of the nanospheres in suspension with fluorescein was measured using a nicomp 380 zls particle sizing systems port richey fl dynamic light scattering zeta potential analyzer and found to be 36 3 0 9 mv under the conditions used in the work sulfate modified polystyrene nanospheres were selected for the work because sand grains have negative surface charges under most natural ph conditions ph greater than approx 2 so electrostatics do not favor attachment of the nanospheres to sand surfaces this allows for study of how evaporation induced flow patterns influence nanoparticle behavior in the absence of surface chemical conditions favorable to attachment making the work relevant to understanding the fate of other highly mobile nanoparticles in unsaturated media the unconsolidated porous medium used for this work was created from clusters of u s silica f 45 sand a high purity natural sand with a measured mean grain size of 323 μm kibbey and chen 2012 2 2 imaging and image processing imaging for this work was conducted using a leica buffalo grove il sp 8 confocal microscope confocal microscopy uses specialized laser optics to collect only in focus light allowing for imaging to be conducted as a function of depth yielding three dimensional information about the sample imaging was conducted in resonance mode to allow rapid scanning with depth clusters of sand grains were created on microscope slides by first placing a thin layer of epoxy on the slides and then gently pouring sand grains onto the slide the resulting clusters contained several hundred individual grains and were typically several grains deep note that only grains in the lowest level of the clusters were attached to the slide with the epoxy the upper layers rested on the lower layers which served to hold upper grains in place experiments were conducted in the top layers of clusters and involved placing a drop of nanosphere suspension on the cluster and then imaging as the suspension evaporated imaging was conducted using the 488 nm line of the argon laser for excitation of the fluorescein and 561 nm diode pumped solid state dpss laser for excitation of the nanoparticles a 10 magnification 0 3 aperture dry objective was used for all imaging two systems were studied for this work specific details of the systems studied are discussed in the results and discussion in the context of the experimental results however the imaged region for each experiment contained between one and two million voxels and had dimensions in each direction less than 1 mm a small fraction of the total cluster dimension imaging was conducted at intervals of several seconds confocal data were processed using fiji a variant of imagej schindelin et al 2012 schneider et al 2012 and the imaris software package bitplane zurich switzerland 2 3 numerical simulation a two dimensional numerical simulation was used to explore how evaporation induces flow in grain clusters because the imaged regions covered only a small portion of the experimental grain clusters and significant evaporation and flow occurred outside of the imaged regions it was not possible to determine boundary conditions for the imaged region from the experimental data as such simulations were used to explore flow in computer generated synthetic systems simulations were based on a quasi static flow model used previously by the authors to study flow and transport during evaporation on individual grain surfaces adegbule et al 2018 the model is based on the recognition that evaporation of capillary held water films is accompanied by an increase in capillary pressure the model simulates the changing capillary held film configuration with increasing capillary pressure and then uses water mass balances to evaluate the flow needed to reconcile differences in the spatial distribution of evaporation from the surface between capillary pressure steps and the film thicknesses dictated by capillary pressure theoretical capillary held water film configurations are calculated by solving the young laplace equation for incrementally increasing capillary pressures using the algorithm described by previously by kibbey 2013 the algorithm uses an iterative approach to calculate the changing contact line positions as films recede a zero slope boundary condition was used for all calculations in this work water film configurations were calculated for capillary pressures from 0 1 to 0 3 cm water at 0 1 cm intervals from 0 3 to 1 5 cm water at 0 2 cm intervals from 1 5 to 3 0 cm water at 0 3 cm intervals and from 3 0 to 6 0 cm water at 0 5 cm intervals smaller intervals were used at lower capillary pressures because air water interface shape varies more with capillary pressure at lower capillary pressures it should be noted that the exact details of steps used don t influence the observed trends the evaporation for all water surfaces is taken to be spatially uniform as dictated by the langmuir evaporation equation as such the total water evaporated between each capillary pressure step is distributed uniformly across the water surface and then mass balance is used to calculate the change in water mass at each point in space between capillary pressure steps eq 1 adegbule et al 2018 1 m i j c 1 m i 1 j m i 1 j m i j 1 m i j 1 m i j e m i j c 2 where m i j c 1 and m i j c 2 are the masses of water at point i j at capillary pressure c 1 and c 2 m i j e is the evaporated mass of water at point i j from capillary pressure c 1 to c 2 m i 1 j 1 is the mass of water transferred between point i 1 j 1 and point i j from capillary pressure c 1 to c 2 because of the small size of the simulated region flow is assumed to be laminar and viscosity and film thickness dictates the resistance to flow between any two points the series of equations described by eq 1 are solved implicitly at each capillary pressure step for this work no flow boundaries are used around the outside of the simulated region additional calculations with the model were used to explore differences in water flux resulting from evaporation and drainage in a simplified 1d system 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows two representations of the grain configuration in one of the two grain cluster regions studied in this work system 1 fig 1a shows a top projection in the x y plane from the confocal data the image is a reversed image of the fluorescein channel where the intensities in the z direction are summed reversing the image means that the parts of the image with the longest path lengths through the fluorescein are darkest meaning that the bright portions of the image correspond to individual sand grains with the brightest grains having the highest top surface elevations fig 1b is a three dimensional rendering of the grain top surface from the same data note that grains themselves are opaque so imaging can only be conducted in pore space above grains as such the grain configuration below the visible portion is unknown the imaged region has horizontal dimensions of 661 μm 661 μm and an imaged depth of 454 μm corresponding to 128 x 128 y 106 z voxels with individual voxel dimensions of 5 16 μm x 5 16 μm y 4 28 μm z the imaged region shows portions of between 9 and 12 individual small sand grains imaging was conducted for this system at 9 24 s intervals fig 2 shows three dimensional images generated from the confocal volume data at nine different times as evaporation progresses note that a video corresponding to the system shown in fig 2 is included in the accompanying online supplementary material the numbers by the individual images correspond to minutes since the start of the experiment the images are created from the nanosphere fluorescence channel of the confocal data e g 561 nm excitation wavelength in the color map used for the rendering shown to the right of the figure fluorescence is rendered on a scale ranging through black red yellow and white with higher fluorescence shown as brighter colors e g yellow white because the individual nanoparticles are smaller than voxel dimensions individual nanoparticles can t be resolved with confocal imaging in these systems however cumulative fluorescence in each voxel is detected so rendered color is an indication of nanoparticle concentration with brighter colors corresponding to higher concentrations that means the method can detect the nanoparticle suspension e g the contours of the water surface and water grain interfaces as well as higher concentrations of accumulated nanoparticles both on sand grains and where suspended nanoparticle aggregates are present at early times in fig 2 nanoparticle suspension occupies the water in the spaces around the soil grains although some individual nanoparticle aggregates are visible in the pore space especially apparent in the accompanying video where their motion can be observed the distribution of nanoparticles in the suspension is relatively uniform as time progresses evaporation continues and the water surface drops gradually exposing the tops of sand grains as the grains are exposed the exposed portions are bright indicating high fluorescence and correspondingly a high concentration of retained nanoparticles on the exposed portions of the grains by 12 min portions of the top surfaces of four of the highest elevation grains are visible while by 17 6 min the tops of 6 grains are visible as the water recedes up through 17 6 min it can be seen that porewater fluorescence increases indicating that in addition to causing deposition on grain surfaces evaporation is increasing the nanoparticle concentration of the suspension finally at 23 1 min most of the porewater from the imaged region has evaporated leaving deposited nanoparticles on the surfaces of all of the grains present before discussing the behavior of system 1 further it is useful to first explore expected flow behaviors in a simulated system experiencing evaporation as a basis for discussion of observed behaviors fig 3 shows six different three dimensional views of the calculated evaporation driven flow in a synthetic cluster at different capillary pressures the simulated region is 512 μm 512 μm with a maximum height of 256 μm so is similar in size to the imaged regions studied in confocal data in this work the synthetic cluster consists of one high grain surface front left and one low grain surface rear right because the model is a 2d model the grains are approximated as mounds to provide a smooth elevation map in the form z f x y the water surfaces shown correspond to each capillary pressure while the vectors show the calculated flow directions between the previous i e lower and current simulated capillary pressure steps two major phenomena are observable in the simulation 1 flow towards contact lines and 2 complex larger scale flow patterns that exhibit flow in pores first towards newly exposed high elevation surfaces and then later away from them as other newly formed lower elevation contact lines influence the bulk flow at a capillary pressure of 0 2 cm water upper left subfigure only the front left grain surface protrudes from the water while the rear right grain is fully submerged note that the flow directions are towards the contact line of the front left grain in the 0 2 cm water subfigure after 0 5 cm upper right subfigure when portions of both grains become exposed flow directions are from the bulk towards the contact lines for both grains note that this is true even in the 2 7 and 4 0 cm cases bottom row where although the large arrows appear to flow past the front left grain towards the rear right grain close examination of the data shows net inflow of water to grid cells adjacent to contact lines on both grains this is not visible in the figures because of the small magnitude of flow towards contact lines in those regions compared with rapid flow past the grains note also in the 2 7 and 4 0 cm cases that contact lines are evident where the water has receded from the bottom surface of the simulated region in the front right and rear left flow also occurs towards these contact lines the results of these simulations support the frequently observed behavior of suspended colloids and nanoparticles accumulating on grain surfaces near contact lines in part as a result of convective flow towards contact lines e g dathe et al 2014 flury and aramrak 2017 zevi et al 2006 wan and tokunaga 2005 correctly identified the source of this behavior as a phenomenon referred to as the coffee ring effect where evaporation drives flow and advection to the perimeter of an evaporating drop because of flow required to reconcile the spatial distribution of evaporation with the constraints of capillarity on interface shape adegbule et al 2018 deegan et al 1997 the effect is named because it can result in a ring of precipitates or deposited particles at the perimeter of an evaporating drop although flow directly adjacent to grains is towards the contact lines at a slightly larger scale the coffee ring effect can create extremely complex flow patterns that change throughout the course of evaporation a phenomenon that could potentially influence the extent of mixing at the pore scale for example at low capillary pressures in the simulation fig 3 the bulk flow is generally from the rear right to the front left while at higher capillary pressures it is from the front left to rear right in general flow is observed towards higher elevation surfaces as they initially protrude from the water surface as the water level continues to drop other emerging surfaces dominate the flow causing flow to change directions as will be discussed in a subsequent paragraph this phenomenon is also observable in the experimental data collected for this work while flow in pores can change directions throughout evaporation the fact that flow near grain surfaces is towards contact lines means that particles being carried past grains by evaporation driven flow may be drawn towards surfaces and intercepted fig 4 shows an experimental system system 2 that illustrates this phenomenon the imaged region has horizontal dimensions of 671 μm 671 μm and an imaged depth of 347 μm corresponding to 128 x 128 y 81 z voxels with individual voxel dimensions of 5 24 μm x 5 24 μm y 4 28 μm z the three dimensional images in fig 4 were generated from confocal volume data at nine different times as evaporation progresses using the same settings as used in fig 2 the color map for fig 4 is also the same as that used in fig 2 note that a video corresponding to the system shown in fig 4 is included in the accompanying online supplementary material while system 1 fig 2 explored behavior in a cluster of small grains the imaged region for system 2 fig 4 shows one large grain approx 530 600 μm just to the right of center and portions of three other grains imaging was conducted for this system at 3 71 s intervals of interest in fig 4 are two different nanoparticle aggregates that are carried into the imaged area from the front left and deposited on the large grain as the water surface recedes with evaporation the upper six subfigures track the two aggregates indicated with white circles numbers in the subfigures correspond to time in minutes since the start of the experiment paths followed by the aggregates over the imaged duration are shown in the final 12 6 min image the plot at the bottom of the figure shows the top projected velocity for the two aggregates and also indicates the times of image subfigures in red symbols on the time axis note that the two aggregates are initially transported rapidly towards the rear right but then as the water begins to recede from the grain around 5 min their paths turn to the right towards the grain and they are intercepted by the grain surface at the receding contact line after approx 6 min the aggregates are essentially immobilized on the grain surface this behavior is consistent with the existence of local evaporation induced flow towards receding contact lines while the potential importance of contact lines in the deposition of colloids and nanoparticles is widely recognized it is important to emphasize that convective flow towards contact lines is something that can only result from evaporation at the pore scale and not from other behaviors that cause changing water contents fig 5 uses the same numerical model from fig 3 to simulate water motion resulting from evaporation a and drainage b from an interface pinned to a sharp ridge the upper right corner of each subfigure it should be noted that a pinned contact line is not required to create the behavior illustrated in the figure but it simplifies the illustration the simulations correspond to a cylindrical air water interface i e infinite radius of curvature in the direction not shown in the figure as might be observed adjacent to a long straight ridge the dimensions of the simulated region are 100 μm in the x direction and 70 μm in the z direction in the case of evaporation water is assumed to leave the system uniformly over the surface while in the case of drainage water is assumed to flow out from the left boundary in all cases the slope at the left of the simulation is set to zero and water configuration is calculated to increase in 2 cm capillary pressure steps as shown note that because of the cylindrical interfaces all water surfaces in the figure have cross sections that are portions of circles red arrows in the figure indicate how water leaves the system e g evaporation in a drainage in b while blue arrows in the figure show the calculated water volumetric flux required to move between capillary pressure steps subject to the defined boundary conditions in the case of evaporation fig 5a increasing capillary pressures create advective flow towards the contact line while in the case of drainage fig 5b increasing capillary pressures create advective flow away from the contact line that means that behavior such as that observed in fig 4 system 2 i e colloids being drawn towards a contact line as they flow past could only result from evaporation while other sources of interface motion such as drainage can potentially trap colloids and nanoparticles at contact lines the behavior does not result from convective flow towards contact lines fig 6 illustrates the complex larger scale flow patterns that result from evaporation in system 1 figs 1 and 2 red arrows correspond to specific manually identified suspended aggregates of nanospheres arrow tails begin at the position of the aggregate in each image shown while the arrow head position corresponds to the aggregate location in the next frame 9 24 s after the frame shown note that at early times flow is towards the back of the cluster the top of the image where high grain surfaces are present as evaporation proceeds flow directions change repeatedly influenced not only by the grains present in the image but also by grains outside of the imaged area at late times rapid flow is observed towards the front right of the cluster note that this behavior is quite evident in the accompanying video in the online supplementary material while figs 2 and 6 clearly indicate the accumulation of nanoparticles on grain surfaces and the complex changing flow patterns that accompany evaporation they do not provide insight into what is happening below the air water interface figs 7 and 8 show fluorescence from two different vertical planes slicing through the data in each figure the upper left subfigure shows the location of the slice the red dashed line and the direction from which it is viewed the red arrow the remaining subfigures in each figure correspond to the same times shown in all but the first subfigure in fig 2 note that because figs 7 and 8 only show fluorescence in the imaged slice rather than a sum brightness in figs 7 and 8 is a direct indicator of nanoparticle concentration in both figures it is possible to see the receding water level with increasing time furthermore it is apparent that the porewater concentration of nanoparticles increases with time as water evaporates as evidenced by the imaged porewater color changing from blue to green with increasing time this effect is evident in both figures and can be observed by comparing the porewater at time 3 7 min to that at 17 6 min another interesting feature that can be observed in figs 7 and 8 is accumulation of nanoparticles in the vicinity of the air water interface as water evaporates the effect is particularly noticeable at 12 0 and 14 8 min in the figures as evidenced by the bright green at the interface this behavior likely indicates that the water evaporation causes the interface to recede more rapidly than the nanoparticles are able to diffuse away from the interface and into the bulk note that the enhanced concentration near the air water interface extends over a depth of as much as 50 μm approx 500 particle diameters so is not the result of adsorption at the air water interface because these nanoparticles are hydrophilic and negatively charged significant adsorption at the air water interface wouldn t be expected in any case the fact that this behavior occurs suggests that any mixing that accompanies the complex temporally varying evaporation driven flow patterns fig 6 may be primarily in the horizontal direction in this system and thus not sufficient to cause significant mixing of suspended nanoparticles in the direction perpendicular to the air water interface the resulting increased concentrations near the air water interface may further enhance their retention at contact lines also apparent in figs 7 and 8 is that the accumulation on grain surfaces only happens as the receding water surface exposes grains accumulation is not evident below the water surface this is apparent from the bright spots that appear at high points on grain surfaces as the water surface recedes for example in fig 7 at 12 0 and 14 8 min bright spots i e accumulated nanoparticles appear at the top of the rightmost grain as the water continues to recede bright spots are visible at the tops of both the left and right grains by 20 3 min similarly in fig 8 accumulation is evident at the peaks of highest grains as they are exposed by the receding air water interface note that accumulation is greatest in regions where the air water interface is receding slowly giving nanoparticles time to be transported to the contact line for example in fig 7 the air water interface only gradually recedes from the high point on the left for the first 17 6 min leading to significant accumulation on top of the grain then over the next 2 7 min the interface rapidly sweeps downward past the steep portion of the grain resulting in little accumulation on the side of the grain by 23 1 min most of the remaining water has either evaporated or flowed out of the imaged region yielding little additional accumulation it should be noted that while accumulation of nanoparticles is observed on grain surfaces as air water interfaces recede accumulation is not evident in the water below the interface in any of the images this observation is consistent with a lack of affinity between the negatively charged nanoparticles and the negatively charged sand grain surfaces and further indicates that the accumulation on grain surfaces during evaporation in this system results from the hydraulics of evaporation induced flow 4 conclusions the results of this work show that pore water flow induced by evaporation can lead to deposition of suspended nanoparticles even in cases where attachment is not favorable simulations support the idea that flow occurs to balance the spatial distribution of evaporation with the interface shape requirements dictated by capillary pressure a phenomenon known as the coffee ring effect close to grain surfaces flow occurs towards contact lines producing a driving force for deposition of nanoparticles in the pore spaces farther from grains however the flow resulting from evaporation can exhibit complex temporally changing patterns in general flow is observed towards higher elevation grain surfaces as they protrude from the air water surface as time progresses and water recedes flow towards newly emerging grains dominates the net flow patterns while both evaporation and drainage can potentially produce similarly complex pore scale flow patterns simulations suggest that only flow induced by evaporation will produce convective flow towards contact lines this means that although trapping of colloids and nanoparticles by moving contact lines may still occur during drainage the mechanisms of retention during evaporation are likely different the results of this work have implications for understanding the movement and deposition of nanoparticles and other colloids not only in the unsaturated zone but also potentially in any multiphase system where changing phase volumes e g through dissolution or evaporation create pore scale flow gradients the following are the supplementary data related to

the loading phase δ13c tce was slightly enriched up to 2 due to diffusion effects stimulated by degradation in the aquitard in the upper aquifer during the release phase i source removal triggered a huge δ13c increase especially for higher ces ii moreover downstream decreasing isotope ratios caused by downgradient later onset of the release phase with temporal increasing isotope ratios reflect aquitard degradation as opposed to downstream increasing and temporally constant isotope ratios in reactive aquifers and iii the carbon isotope mass balance cimb enriched up to 4 as lower ces more depleted less sorbing have been transported deeper into the aquitard thus enriched cimb does not indicate oxidative transformation in this system the cimb enrichment enhanced with more sorption and lower aquitard thickness thin aquitards are quicker flushed from lower ces leading to faster cimb enrichment over time cimb enrichment is smaller or nearly absent when daughter products accumulate aquifer csia patterns indicative of aquitard degradation were similar in case of linear decreasing rate constants but contrasted with previous simulations assuming a thin bioactive zone the rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the extent of tce degradation in aquifer samples especially during the loading phase and for conditions leading to long remediation time frames low groundwater flow velocity thicker aquitards strong sorption in the aquitard the rayleigh equation provides a good and useful picture on aquitard degradation during the release phase throughout the sensitivity

breukelen and prommer 2008 such models were also applied to the study of combined reaction degradation or sorption and diffusion in aquitards wanner et al 2017 2016 and aquifer aquitard systems wanner et al 2018a 2018b recently modelling of csia data enabled the differentiation and quantification of two specific degradation pathways of chlorohydrocarbons in an aquitard wanner et al 2018a the isotope ratios of volatile organic compounds in the transmissive zone in the vicinity of a non reactive aquitard were studied through such rtms diffusion towards low permeability layers was shown to have a potential for carbon isotope enrichment within the aquifer labolle et al 2008 the latter being likely attenuated and negligible compared to potential degradation induced enrichment that could occur in the transmissive zone also after back diffusion xu et al 2017 however processes leading to stronger isotope fractionation in the aquitard such as degradation could potentially lead to detectable enrichment at the aquifer level wanner et al 2018b xu et al 2017 moreover diffusion of daughter products from the low permeability layers to the aquifer was shown to contribute to plume tailing rasa et al 2011 wanner et al 2018b it is relevant to investigate whether any csia data of tce or of its degradation products sampled in the aquifer could be used for degradation assessment despite the low concentration levels recently wanner et al 2018b demonstrated with a modelling study that tce to cdce degradation in shallow bioactive zones of aquitards could cause unique csia patterns in above lying aquifers this study extends to the aforementioned work and sets out to illustrate to which extent spatial and temporal carbon csia patterns could be informative of ces reductive degradation in aquitards despite the impacts of non destructive processes on both the concentration and isotope ratios to this end we apply virtual experiments i e run reactive transport models fed with sets of representative model parameters for common field conditions for example the hydraulic parameters chosen for the model were based on previous hydrological models predicting plume tailings for different types of low permeability layers following up to the work of wanner et al 2018b we simulated the full sequence of reductive dechlorination assessed the effect of thinner aquifers and deeper bioactive zones and evaluated the performance of the rayleigh equation and cimb as common csia data interpretation tools the main objectives of this modelling study are 1 development of a model that simulates carbon csia and concentration patterns in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system before and after source removal and 2 evaluating the potential of csia data to detect reductive dechlorination and the extent of tce degradation as occurring in the aquitard while setting a sensitivity analysis on model parameters with the sensitivity analysis we demonstrate the effect of critical model parameters like aquitard thickness and degree of sorption on simulation results the performance of the rayleigh equation to determine tce degradation and the use of the carbon isotope mass balance under these specific conditions is also assessed finally we provide recommendations to practitioners on how csia data from aquifers can be used and interpreted for the detection and quantification of reductive dechlorination in low permeability layers 2 methods 2 1 general model concept fig 1 represents the general model concept for the base case scenario consisting of a 100 m long and 10 m high cross sectional domain a 1 m thick clay aquitard separates an 8 m thick upper sand aquifer from a lower aquifer of which only the upper 1 m is modelled the model simulates two temporal phases a loading phase during which dissolution of a tce dnapl source present at the bottom of the upper aquifer leads to tce advection through the aquifer following groundwater flow and tce diffusion into the clay aquitard followed by a release phase which focusses on back diffusion of ces from the clay aquitard to the aquifer after the dnapl is removed after 10 years adamson et al 2016 a natural hydraulic gradient of 0 0042 m m 1 was imposed through the boundary conditions leading together with the selected permeability and porosity see later to a groundwater flow velocity of 0 12 m d 1 in the sand aquifers for simplicity sorption of ces is assumed to occur only in the aquitard likewise sequential reductive dechlorination from tce to dce vc and finally ethene is only assumed to occur with a uniform rate constant across the aquitard discussed further in section 2 4 localised reductive dechlorination rd in the aquitard in an otherwise unreactive aquifer is likely as the aquifer unlike the aquitard can be too oxic to host reductive processes as it was previously observed at the borden site wanner et al 2016 aquitards usually contain higher contents of soil organic matter that can potentially act as electron donor in reductive dechlorination wanner et al 2016 the model is described in detail in the following 2 2 modelling approach the multicomponent reactive transport code pht3d prommer et al 2001 was applied using the flopy python package bakker et al 2016 as interface pht3d allows combining the geochemical model phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 1999 with the 3 d multicomponent transport model mt3dms zheng et al 2012 the implicit tvd method was used similarly as in prior publications hunkeler et al 2009 van breukelen et al 2017 2005 phreeqc 2 was employed for modelling carbon isotope fractionation during sequential degradation of chlorinated ethenes mt3dms has been applied before to simulate back diffusion and has been validated with analytical solutions and experimental data chapman et al 2012 each carbon isotopologue was simulated with different values of effective diffusion coefficients d e solid phase organic carbon water partitioning sorption coefficients k oc and first order degradation rate constants k the selection procedure of the aforementioned model parameters is elaborated below 2 3 general model settings the model grid for the base case consists of 200 columns 200 rows and 1 layer grid discretization is of 0 5 m in the horizontal direction columns and of 0 05 m in the vertical direction rows fig 1 results obtained with grids of higher and lower resolutions are presented for comparison in fig s2 in the appendix for simplicity the porosity was set to 0 35 for both the aquitard and aquifers this value is typical for unconsolidated sands albeit at the lower end of clay layers the dry bulk density was set to 1 855 kg l 1 throughout the system the aquifer and aquitard were given a hydraulic conductivity of 3650 m y 1 and 1 m y 1 respectively the low hydraulic conductivity of the clay aquitard leads to negligible flow longitudinal and vertical transverse dispersivities were set to 1 0 m and 1 5 mm respectively these values are in the range of previously reported dispersivities values of plumes in sandy aquifers garabedian et al 1991 klenk and grathwohl 2002 the selected grid spacing above and time step 1 day insure satisfying grid peclet and courant criteria aqueous diffusion coefficient d w values were calculated as 5 9 10 10 m2 s 1 6 9 10 10 m2 s 1 9 7 10 10 m2 s 1 and 1 3 10 9 m2 s 1 for tce dce vc and ethene respectively as elaborated in section 2 5 the fraction of organic content f oc of the clay aquitard was set to 0 0033 0 33 a representative value for fluvial sediments griffioen et al 2016 together with the selected values of other model parameter a retardation factor of 3 5 for tce was obtained similar to prior back diffusion studies carey et al 2015 parker et al 2008 the calculation of the retardation factors is elaborated in section 2 6 during the simulations linear sorption is assumed the high ces concentrations following the dissolution of the dnapl could saturate the sorption capacity in which case freundlich or langmuir sorption isoterms would provide more realistic results the implications of the model simplifications are described further in the discussion 2 4 pollutant source and degradation a tce dnapl source was simulated as a constant concentration boundary condition at the lower 2 m of the upper aquifer for 10 years fig 1 such source positioning was previously used in the study of back diffusion of both napl and dnapl xu et al 2017 the tce source concentration 0 6 g l 1 was about half the tce solubility 1 28 g l 1 and 6 105 times larger than the typical carbon csia quantification limit 1 μg l 1 concentrations and isotope ratios are shown only for concentrations above this quantification limit the source was given a constant isotope composition δ13c tcesource of 30 setting a constant isotope ratio for a dissolving dnapl is acceptable as the model does not simulate degradation in the sand aquifer and therefore no weathering of the dnapl hunkeler et al 2004 hwang et al 2013 the three carbon isotopologues of each ce and ethene are simulated as done before for chlorine isotopologues hunkeler et al 2009 the tce carbon isotopologue concentrations in the source were calculated from the tce concentration and isotope ratio of the source as described in appendix section s3 after a simulation time of 10 years the loading phase was stopped by setting the concentration of each ce at the constant concentration boundary condition to 0 g l 1 biological reductive dechlorination in the aquitard degrades sequentially tce to dce vc and finally ethene the model assumes that only the major cis dce isomer is formed first order degradation rate constants for biotic reductive dechlorination are selected in the line with the values employed in van breukelen et al 2005 i e 1 y 1 0 2 y 1 and 0 2 y 1 for tce dce and vc respectively table s4 in appendix although the high source concentration applied calls for monod kinetics bekins et al 1997 first order kinetics often used at field sites was chosen for simplicity and also further additional complexity such as microbial growth inhibition and donor limitation chambon et al 2013 was ignored degradation rate constants were assumed to remain constant with depth in the base case model as opposed to two recent studies where bioactivity was assumed to be i retrained a centimeters thin bioactive zone at the top of a thick aquitard as modelled by exponentially declining rate constants with depth wanner et al 2018b or ii declining gradually with depth as modelled by nearly linearly decreasing rate constants till about 1 m depth wanner et al 2018a in those previous studies likely the microorganisms distribution lead to decline of the degradation rate constants with depth in the one study the decreasing availability of nutrients and electron donors diffusing from the aquifer to the aquitard likely influenced the degradation rate constants wanner et al 2018b in the other study the limited presence of microorganisms responsible for degradation of the chlorohydrocarbons of concern deeper than 0 35 cm together with the near linearly decreasing degradation rate constants below this depth could indicate that transport of microorganisms remains a potential limitation for biotic degradation across thick aquitards wanner et al 2018a for thin aquitards 1 m with rich organic carbon content the contact with aquifers both above and below is likely to allow a more homogeneous bacterial distribution than for the aquitards described in those prior studies moreover several bacterial strains including dehaloccocoides spp a strain able of complete tce to ethene degradation were present across the studied depth of 1 1 m wanner et al 2018a unfortunately at this stage studies on degradation and bacterial activity in aquitards are still limited the choice of low uniform degradation rate constants in the aquitard is therefore a simplification which could be refined later once bacterial degradation in aquitard is better understood each isotopologue degrades with a slightly different rate constant leading to isotope fractionation of the ces for carbon this fractionation is usually modelled as a bulk isotope fractionation i e simplifying the model to the evolution of the compound s fraction of the light and the heavy isotope van breukelen et al 2017 2005 for this isotopologue model we express the respective degradation rates of each isotopologue employing the bulk kinetic carbon isotope enrichment factor ε degradation 1 d c ll dt k c ll 2 d c lh dt k ε degradation 1 c lh 3 d c hh dt k 2 ε degradation 1 c hh where ll c lh c and hh c are the isotopologue concentrations moles of the carbon isotopologues containing two light ll carbon isotopes one light l and one heavy h isotope lh and two heavy isotopes hh respectively and k y 1 the first order degradation rate constant carbon isotope fractionation of chlorinated ethenes during biotic reductive dechlorination has been intensively studied for this model average values of bulk carbon isotope enrichment factors ε degradation obtained with microcosm experiments were used for the base case scenario i e 12 21 and 23 table s3 during biotic reductive dechlorination of tce dce and vc respectively the variability of enrichment factors reflects the diversity of degradative microorganisms for instance ε degradation during tce reductive dechlorination was found to vary from 3 3 to 18 9 cichocka et al 2008 we restrained from assessing this variability on the model outcome testing only a single lower value for each ε degradation in an additional simulation in section 3 5 2 5 diffusion and diffusion induced isotope fractionation aqueous diffusion coefficients of each ce isotopologue were acquired from the aqueous diffusion coefficients of the ces each ce s aqueous diffusion coefficient d w was first calculated through worch 1993 4 d w 3 595 10 14 t η t m ce 0 53 where t is the water temperature k set for the model to 283 15 k 10 c η t the water s viscosity at t pa s and m ce is the ce s weighted molar mass using isotopologues abundances at 0 table s5 in appendix each isotopologue was then assigned a specific diffusion coefficient to model diffusion induced isotope fractionation recent work showed that for a ce with n isotopologues isotopologue specific aqueous diffusion coefficients d w n of the isotopologue n are defined by jin et al 2014 5 d w n d w i n a i m i m n β where a i and m i are the relative abundance and the mass of the isotopologue i respectively and β is an empirical coefficient determined experimentally for each compound the abundances at 0 and masses of the isotopologues given in table s5 in appendix were then employed to calculate the diffusion coefficients of each isotopologue the diffusion coefficient of the compound will be slightly modified by the change in its isotopologue composition measurements obtained with a modified stroke s diffusion cell wanner and hunkeler 2015 yielded β values of 0 029 0 008 and 0 024 0 002 for carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation of tce respectively through the modelling of diffusion experiments in gel diffusion tubes a slightly higher β value for chlorine isotope enrichment of tce was obtained 0 043 0 008 while of dce 0 088 0 015 jin et al 2014 the difference between tce and dce might be explained by the role of the hydration shell in the extent of diffusion induced isotope fractionation jin et al 2014 in the present model we used the β values reported by wanner et al wanner and hunkeler 2015 considering the similarity of β values for carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation of tce we assumed that the same applies to dce therefore we used β 0 088 for the carbon isotope effects of dce no experimental β values for vc and ethene are available for those compounds we used the value of 0 088 given that dce in the closest available analogue for these compounds jin et al 2014 resulting diffusion induced carbon isotope enrichment factors ε diffusion are 0 2 0 9 1 4 and 3 1 for tce dce vc and ethene respectively table s4 only 1 d w lh d w ll is given here for simplicity where d w lh and d w ll are the aqueous diffusion coefficients for the isotopologue containing one heavy and one light and two light isotopes respectively table s5 in appendix lists the isotopologue specific aqueous diffusion coefficients in porous media molecules diffuse around the sediment grains of the rock matrix therefore the effective diffusion coefficient d e is smaller than d w in order to account for the added travel distance d e was taken as d e d w τ app 7 where d w is defined for each isotopologue using eq 4 and τ app is the apparent diffusion tortuosity coefficient also referred to as the tortuosity factor carey et al 2016 the coefficient τ app is often written as a function of the accessible porosity for simplicity boving and grathwohl 2001 recent work suggests that the coefficient τ app is correlated to the permeability not to the porosity of a media with an average τ app of 0 33 for low permeability media carey et al 2016 fitting of tce diffusion profiles in clay suggested much lower τ app values 0 13 wanner and hunkeler 2015 0 03 wanner et al 2016 in the present study τ app is taken equal to the porosity across the model 0 35 in the base case scenario 2 6 sorption and sorption induced isotope fractionation the retardation factor r represents the degree of retardation of a compound with respect to the local groundwater flow velocity and is calculated as follows 6 r 1 ρ b n k oc f oc where ρ b is the bulk density across the aquifer aquitard aquifer system kg l 1 k oc is the solid phase organic carbon water partition coefficient l kg 1 and n the porosity k oc values are usually derived from its correlation with the octanol water partitioning coefficient k ow lu et al 2011 nguyen et al 2005 the present study applied eq 7 to the logk ow values of 2 47 1 98 1 62 and 1 27 for tce dce vc and ethene respectively following the approach and the values reported in van breukelen et al 2005 the k oc values are then of 142 l kg 1 75 l kg 1 39 l kg 1 and 27 l kg 1 for tce dce vc and ethene respectively table s4 valsaraj et al 1999 7 k oc 10 0 81 k ow 0 56 the present simulation sets f oc to 0 3 in the aquitard so tce retardation is of 3 5 as in prior modelling studies of aquifer aquitard systems see table s1 in appendix the selected f oc value results in retardation factors r of 2 3 1 8 and 1 5 for dce vc and ethene respectively after applying eq 6 and eq 7 sorption induced isotope fractionation results from the slightly stronger sorption to organic matter of molecules with light isotopes than those with heavy isotopes kopinke et al 2005 the fractionation factor for linear equilibrium sorption α sorption has been defined as the ratio of the k oc of the heavy h k oc and the one of the light isotope l k oc höhener and yu 2012 kopinke et al 2005 van breukelen and prommer 2008 wanner et al 2017 the resulting sorption induced isotope fractionation is included in the model by attributing different k oc values to each isotopologue see table s5 in appendix the calculation of isotopologue specific k oc values was inspired by höhener and yu 2012 we extended their approach for comparing data of differently deuterated compounds to carbon isotopologues for which no specific relation was yet developed the resulting relation is 8 α lh sorption α hh sorption 1 2 where lh α sorption and hh α sorption are the sorption induced fractionation factors of the isotopologue containing one light l and one heavy h and two heavy hh carbon isotopes respectively the k oc values of the two isotopologues containing at least one heavy carbon atom can be calculated from 9 k lh oc α lh sorption k ll oc 10 k hh oc α lh sorption 2 k ll oc where ll k oc lh k oc and hh k oc are the k oc values of the isotopologue containing two light carbon isotopes one light and one heavy and two heavy respectively isotopologue specific k oc values were estimated using the fractionation factor α sorption taken from the literature see below and the reported k oc values ll k oc k oc was assumed which is an acceptable approximation considering the large variation of k oc an example of the calculation of the isotopologue specific k oc is presented in the appendix section s5 and the values are reported in table s5 simulations of sorption induced isotope fractionation during advection with an analytical solution van breukelen and prommer 2008 yielded identical results for the isotope and this isotopologue approach see fig s1 in appendix laboratory experiments on homogeneous media yielded sorption induced carbon isotope enrichment factors ε sorption α sorption 1 for 6 different organic compounds ε sorption in the range of 0 9 to 0 1 imfeld et al 2014 unfortunately little is known about the specific ε sorption values of ces only ε sorption of tce is available 0 52 0 19 and 0 26 0 10 based on free energy linear relationships höhener and yu 2012 a recent multi step sorption study of dcm and 1 2 dca reports ε sorption values of about 0 54 and 0 4 respectively wanner et al 2017 in the base case scenario lh ε sorption for all ces and ethene was taken at the upper predicted range 0 5 for tce consequently hh ε sorption was of 1 2 7 post modelling calculations 2 7 1 isotope ratio the heavy to light carbon isotope ratios of a sample r h l are calculated from the concentrations of the isotopologues as follow 11 r h l 2 c hh c lh 2 c ll c lh the isotope ratios are reported in the usual delta notation δ13c the δ13c is defined as δ 13 c r r l r vpdb 1 where rvpdb is the carbon isotope ratio of an international standard isotope ratios are calculated only when the ces concentration is above isotope quantification limit taken as 1 μg l for all ces in this study 2 7 2 carbon isotope mass balance the carbon isotope mass balance cimb is the concentration weighted average isotope ratio of the ces and ethene combined 12 cimb δ 13 c i c i c i where δ13ci and ci are carbon isotope ratios and concentrations respectively of the ces and ethene cimb is not calculated when any of the ces concentrations are below the minimum quantification limit for δ13c taken as 1 μg l 1 for all ces for simplicity the concept of cimb has shown useful in other studies aeppli et al 2010 amaral et al 2011 hunkeler et al 1999 as its enrichment points to for example oxidative transformation whereas reductive dechlorination yields constant cimb the cimb can also be calculated excluding ethene which δ13c is not always available in which case constant cimb would be a signal of a lack of vc transformation to ethene for instance 2 7 3 performance of the rayleigh equation to estimate tce degradation the rayleigh equation is commonly applied to estimate the extent of biodegradation of a compound based on its degree of isotope enrichment and the applicable isotope enrichment factor hunkeler et al 2002 13 d rayleigh 1 exp 1 ε degradation ln δ 13 c tce 1 δ 13 c tce source 1 where d rayleigh is the rayleigh based estimate of tce degradation and ε degradation is the bulk carbon enrichment factor during tce degradation a d rayleigh of 0 1 signifies that 10 of the initial tce was degraded the true extent of biodegradation as occurred in the model d sample is calculated from the simulated tce concentration and the concentration of a non degrading tracer with otherwise similar characteristics to tce d sample is calculated for a cell i of the non sorbing aquifer as follows 14 d sample tce i tracer i where tce i and tracer i are the tce and tracer concentrations respectively in cell i the rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the true extent of degradation abe and hunkeler 2006 höyng et al 2015 van breukelen and prommer 2008 but could under some conditions also overestimate if δ13c enrichment resulting from non degradative processes such as sorption at plume fronts or diffusion in plume cores would be attributed to degradation höhener and yu 2012 kopinke et al 2005 van breukelen and prommer 2008 van breukelen and rolle 2012 in order to decrease below the mcl of 5 μg l the initial tce concentration of 0 6 g l must be reduced by 99 999 at such a high number of decimals the ratio of the extents of degradation d rayleigh d sample would be a poor quantifier of the underestimation at overall high extents of degradation using instead the ratio of the rate constants as a measure of the underestimation as done in previous studies lutz et al 2013 van breukelen and prommer 2008 van breukelen and rolle 2012 circumvents this issue as it equals the ratio of the logarithms of the residual fractions given that the rate constant k of a first order reaction satisfies k t ln 1 d where d is the extent of degradation at the time t in the present study the deviation between the true extent of degradation and the rayleigh based estimate is addressed through the following measure θ which quantifies the underestimation of the true first order degradation rate constant k sample by the rayleigh based estimate of the first order degradation rate constant k rayleigh the values of the rates themselves are not the subject of this paper 15 θ ln 1 d rayleigh ln 1 d sample k rayleigh k sample a θ of 1 signifies that both rate constants are equal i e no underestimation of d sample by d rayleigh a θ of 0 8 indicates that the estimate k rayleigh is 1 25 times smaller than the true k sample whereas a θ of 0 1 means that k rayleigh is 10 times smaller than the true k sample i e d rayleigh strongly underestimates d sample θ is calculated only for significant δ13c tce enrichment i e the isotopic shift δ13c between δ13c tce and δ13c tcesource is beyond 1 a value below a threshold of 2 cannot be taken with certainty as an indication of degradation considering the analytical uncertainty of carbon csia and site heterogeneity hunkeler et al 2008 however in practice enrichment beyond 1 is considered to be an indication of degradation two additional concepts are defined for the sake of this study to estimate the true degradation effect at a larger scale than the scale of a sample the total mass decrease of tce versus the one of the tracer as occurred in the model is calculated at a certain distance downgradient for 1 the entire depth of the aquitard d aquitard and 2 the entire depth of the aquifer aquitard aquifer system d system d aquitard and d system are therefore the ratios of tce and the tracer s mass across a column of the model as in eq 16 16 d 1 i n 1 ρ b η f oc k oc tce v i η tce i 1 ρ b η f oc k oc tce v i η tracer i where n is the number of rows in the aquitard or in the aquifer column respectively tce i and tracer i the concentration for this column at the row i mg l 1 f oc is the local fraction of organic carbon only different between the aquifer and the aquitard η is the porosity dimentionless k oc tce the solid phase organic carbon water partition coefficients of tce identical for the tracer l kg 1 and ρ b is the bulk density v i the the cells volume m3 the length and width of the model cells are always the same but the height of the cells varies accross depth d aquifer and d aquitard are 0 when there is no degradation and 100 when degradation is maximal 3 results and discussion 3 1 complete model including ces degradation loading phase the base case scenario is employed to simulate ces concentrations and isotope ratios following flow diffusion sorption and degradation including associated carbon isotope effects this section focusses on the loading phase until the plume is removed during the loading phase the dissolving dnapl forms a plume with high tce concentration in the aquifer the concentration gradient between the aquifer and the aquitard drives tce diffusion into the initially pristine aquitard in the aquitard transport is governed by diffusion only advective transport does not occur at the end of the loading phase in year 10 daughter products show the highest concentration a few centimeters 2 cm to 15 cm below the interface fig 2a resulting from their sequential production in the aquitard close up of the aquitard available in the appendix fig s4 the centers of the ces masses are spatially separated with ethene present the deepest followed by vc dce and tce fig 2a and b ces sequential reductive dechlorination sorption and diffusion create these patterns in concert the more dechlorinated the compound the later it is formed in the degradation sequence the less it sorbs and the faster it diffuses for instance ethene is the end product of reductive dechlorination it sorbs least and diffuses fastest compared to the other compounds whereas the peak concentration of tce in the aquitard decreases downgradient those of the daughter products remain remarkably similar fig 2a plain vs dashed lines daughter products which back diffused to upgradient parts of the aquifer are transporteddowngradient where they again diffuse into the aquitard consequently daughter product concentration peaks remain high right below the aquifer aquitard interface throughout the aquitard also away from the source dashed line fig 2a simulations allow comparing the base case scenario dysy which includes both the diffusion and sorption induced isotope fractionation effects to a model disregarding both those effects dnsn as well as two intermediary scenarios dysn and dnsy see description of these simulation codes in caption of fig 2 details of additional simulations in the absence of degradation are presented in the appendix section s7 for all scenarios including tce degradation δ13c tce enriches with depth in the aquitard with as much as 45 at 30 cm depth in year 10 fig 2c this enrichment is strongly larger than the negligible δ13c tce enrichment predicted in the absence of reductive dechlorination 0 5 fig s3c resulting solely from the combined effects of sorption and diffusion induced isotope fractionation each lesser chlorinated ethene presents a more depleted δ13c than its precursor which is the usual pattern for reductive dechlorination hunkeler and aravena 2000 slater et al 2000 van breukelen et al 2005 for the base case scenario dysy δ13c of daughter products tend to curve with depth opposed to the straight enrichment of δ13c tce after initial enrichments compared to their starting values δ13c level off and even show a declining trend deep in the aquitard fig 2c when dce or vc eventually travels ahead of its precursor the net δ13c enrichment becomes smaller eventually δ13c decreases with depth below the δ13c peaks for both the models including diffusion induced isotope fractionation fig 2c dysy and dysn the ethene δ13c pattern is different as ethene does not degrade δ13c ethene will not further enrich once it is away from its precursor vc with the selected ε diffusion ethene shows stronger depletion in the base case scenario compared to the simulation omitting diffusion induced isotope fractionation fig 2c 7 for the base case model dysy vs dnsy at 90 cm depth despite a f oc of 0 3 ε sorption itself leads to a small enrichment for all ces and is significant 2 only in the deepest parts of the aquitard fig 2c dysy vs dysn and dnsy vs dnsn in the aquifer the upwards decline of δ13c of dce vc and ethene by a few fig 2c is caused by the faster diffusion of the light isotopes following the upward concentration gradients the cimb increases just below the aquifer aquitard interface where enriched tce and dce are dominant the cimb increase results from the faster downward diffusion of the depleted daughter products fig 2c beneath the cimb strongly decreases with depth until being equal to δ13c ethene once ethene is the dominant compound depletion by about 25 at 0 9 m fig 2c the occurrence of depleted cimb was described before in simulations of ces transport and degradation through an aquifer in presence of sorption van breukelen et al 2005 the different transport velocities of the ces is the main reason for downwards cimb decrease further enhanced by diffusion induced isotope fractionation fig 2c dnsy and dnsn the most depleted cimb predicted in this simulation 55 is close to the range of the lowest reported isotope signatures of pce and tce at a field site 67 9 and 70 respectively nijenhuis et al 2013 as ces isotope profiles in aquitards are employed for retracing ces source history adamson et al 2015 such low cimb in a sorbing aquitard should not be confused for the prior presence of another strongly depleted tce spill concentration and δ13c patterns of ces across the aquifer at the end of the loading phase year 10 are presented in fig 3 daughter products accumulate in the aquifer where their concentrations increase with distance from the source fig 3a at the end of the loading phase daughter product concentrations at the bottom of the aquifer are already several orders of magnitude above the mcls mcl 70 μg l 1 for cis dce 2 μg l 1 for vc fig 3a at year 10 although no degradation occurs in the aquifer δ13c tce downgradient enrichment just above the aquifer aquitard interface is strongly larger than in absence of degradation isotope enrichment δ13c 5 vs 0 05 fig 3c and s3 g respectively tce degradation in the aquitard enhances the concentration gradient at the aquifer aquitard interface the resulting faster diffusion to the aquitard leads to a stronger isotope enrichment in the aquifer the same process leads to the increase of δ13c dce and δ13c vc with distance from the source up to 5 for dce fig 3c however δ13c ethene decreases with distance as ethene accumulates and as degradation is overall less advanced downgradient from the source fig 3c until the release phase daughter product concentrations are much lower than tce concentrations in the aquifer and δ13c tce is enriched consequently the cimb is dictated by δ13c tce at the bottom of the aquifer at the end of the loading phase and therefore enriches with distance fig 3e 3 2 complete model including ces degradation release phase after source removal the main plume is flushed away from the 100 m long stretch of aquifer by upgradient uncontaminated groundwater within about 2 7 years the groundwater flow velocity is of 44 m y 1 the tce concentration gradient is reversed and tce diffuses now back from the aquitard to the aquifer prior to source removal the high tce concentration levels forced the δ13c of ces to low values five years after source removal at year 15 δ13c values of all compounds are considerably higher than during the loading phase and are above their minimum detection limit of 1 μg l interestingly δ13c now strongly decreases downgradient fig 3d the downgradient decline is as much as 10 for dce and vc and near 30 for tce fig 3d the ongoing uniform degradation in the aquitard explains δ13c tce enrichment over time in the entire system while the overall downgradient δ13c tce depletion relates to the delay in flushing of the downgradient parts of the aquifer in appendix and discussed further in section 3 3 the temporal evolution of the ces and ethene are evaluated near the aquitard 95 m downgradient of the source the tce concentration drops below the mcl within 10 years after the source is removed fig 4 concentrations of daughter products near the aquitard also decline but slower and the accumulating product of ces sequential degradation ethene resides in the aquifer nearly as long as the non degrading tracer fig 4a vc concentration away from the source is still above its mcl at year 40 i e 30 years after source removal although tce declined below its mcl long before at year 18 fig 4a simulations of vc or dce stall presented in the appendix show that their concentrations would also remain nearly as high as that of the tracer in the aquifer fig s7 and s8 despite degradation occurs in the aquitard and not in the aquifer the potentially high concentrations and the longevity of the degradation products in the aquifer should be considered in the study of back diffusion shortly after the cleanup cimb significantly increases by 3 and remains high until the end of the simulation fig 4b also for different well screen lengths and positions fig s5 in the appendix the cimb increase points to the loss of depleted compounds from the aquifer during the release phase the more dechlorinated and more depleted compounds have been transported deeper into the aquitard see section 3 1 and do not diffuse back to the aquifer as fast as the more enriched and chlorinated compounds the difference in cimb δcimb was evaluated for several reaction chains with dce or vc as end product instead of ethene δcimb is smaller but still 1 5 after source removal when vc is the end product fig s7 δcimb decreases in a few years to near 0 when dce is the end product fig s8 at field sites cimb is expected to increase only in presence of degradation processes other than reductive dechlorination for instance dce and vc are more readily oxidizable than tce and could degrade in the aquifer provided the right conditions are met coleman et al 2002a 2002b therefore such significant cimb increase could be confused for alternative degradation pathways for the ces 3 3 distinct csia patterns in the aquifer in presence of aquitard degradation with the goal to assess spatial csia patterns characteristic of either aquitard rd or aquifer rd the base case simulation on aquitard rd was compared with another simulation where rd only occurred in the aquifer fig 5 aquifer rd causes monotonously increasing csia patterns of all compounds in downgradient direction during both the loading and release phase fig 5a b similarly as known for aquifer rd without aquitard interactions van breukelen et al 2005 strikingly downgradient csia patterns and their magnitude remain almost unaffected after source removal and remain constant in time long after source removal results not shown during the loading phase the cimb is not increasing downgradient but it slightly increases by about 0 5 during the release phase this minor cimb increase after source removal can be explained by the lower back diffusion rates of the more dechlorinated and more depleted daughter products which have penetrated deeper into the aquitard as they diffuse faster and sorb less these patterns are in strong contrast with those of uniform aquitard rd as discussed shortly before where carbon isotope ratios only limitedly increase downgradient during the loading phase whereas most strikingly after source removal huge isotope enrichment is simulated of all compounds as the aquitard serves as a reservoir of degraded ces as in both cases concentration drop during the release phase isotope ratios is more applicable to discriminate between both hypotheses furthermore the csia patterns decreasing downgradient fig 5b and downgradient cimb increase is substantial especially during the release phase with about 4 fig 5c d a simulation assuming linear decreasing degradation rate constants dropping to zero at the base of the aquitard showed similar csia patterns as the base case simulation fig s6 note that in the case bioactivity is limited to the upper centimeters of aquitards further isotope enrichment over time after the initial jump will not occur while isotope ratios will also not decrease downgradient wanner et al 2018b because the residence time of back diffusing tce in the bioactive zone is invariant interestingly csia patterns may thus inform on the depth of bioactive zones in aquitards or in general the depth of reactivity as aquitards with potentially elevated contents of iron sulfur minerals could also host chemical reductive dechlorination as ce attenuation process in the case rd occurs within the entire system both in the aquitard and the aquifer s the csia patterns become a mixture of the unique features of aquitard and aquifer rd during the loading phase downgradient csia patterns increase for the higher chlorinated ces alike aquifer rd but are more stable for lower chlorinated ces and ethene similar to aquitard rd whereas during the release phase aquifer rd shows increasing csia patterns and aquitard rd shows strongly elevated but decreasing csia patterns rd occurring within the entire system shows elevated but relatively constant csia patterns downgradient at least under the simulated conditions of spatially homogenous first order rate constants even under those conditions aquitard rd is still noticeable as csia patterns of daughter products are much more enriched than in the absence of aquitard rd notably near the source the cimb increase is in between those of purely aquitard and aquifer rd except near the source where the increase is large which differs strongly from the aquifer rd pattern concluding aquitard rd can still be clearly detected by aquifer csia in case also aquifer rd occurs because of i the significant cimb increase and especially ii the strong jump of csia ratios after source removal also near the source and iii the absence of clear increasing and possibly decreasing csia trends downgradient 3 4 performance of the rayleigh equation in assessing the extent of degradation at contaminated sites with a predominant role of aquitard rd csia of samples from conventional wells situated in the aquifer but close to the aquifer aquitard interface could detect and potentially be used to quantify the extent of degradation the base case scenario shows that aquitard rd leaves an imprint on δ13c tce in the aquifer additionally daughter products are detected in the aquifer throughout the simulation this section evaluates whether a csia calculation tool often used for biodegradation assessment at field sites the rayleigh equation provides trustworthy information on the occurrence and degree of tce degradation in the aquitard when based on csia samples from the aquifer 3 4 1 performance of the rayleigh equation for local degradation assessment the direct application of the rayleigh equation to δ13c tce data obtained from a polluted site is in theory sufficient to obtain a conservative estimate of tce degradation as occurred in the samples d rayleigh the underestimation by the rayleigh equation of the true extent of degradation for the simulated conditions can be assessed by comparing d rayleigh to the true extent of degradation d sample as both are obtained from the synthetic dataset lutz et al 2013 prior modelling studies pointed out that d rayleigh systematically underestimates the true extent of degradation under various conditions abe and hunkeler 2006 höyng et al 2015 lutz et al 2017 lutz and van breukelen 2014 van breukelen and prommer 2008 van breukelen and rolle 2012 the underestimation was then the result of the attenuation of degradation induced δ13c enrichment through mixing and dispersion of pollution plumes in aquifers at high extents of degradation for instance above 90 the ratio of the extents of degradation d rayleigh and d sample would be a poor indicator of the underestimation the ratio of the rayleigh equation estimate to the true first order degradation rate constant θ better qualifies the underestimation also at high extent of degradation see section 2 7 fig 6 illustrates the variation of θ in the upper aquifer at various elevations and distances from the source and screen lengths sampling from long well screens or near the source lowers the chance to detect significantly enriched δ13c tce either because of the high tce concentration during the loading phase or due to strong dilution during the release phase because θ is only calculated for δ13c 1 the longest time series of θ can be computed for short screens away from the source and near the aquitard fig 6 when calculated θ varies between 0 5 and 0 9 i e the rayleigh equation underestimates the real first order degradation rate constant with a factor 2 to 1 1 respectively away from the source θ is initially low and progressively decreases from 0 65 to 0 5 during the loading phase fig 6a cyan lines in this initial stage the tce concentration and its isotope ratio have plateaued while the tracer concentration keeps rising fig 4a b indicating that the true extent of degradation d sample increases consequently the gap increases between the csia based degradation estimate and the true extent of degradation causing θ to drop within 10 years after source removal θ increases to high values meaning that the rayleigh equation only slightly underestimates degradation as occurred in samples and a close estimate is obtained tce back diffusing from the aquitard where it has been partially degraded is now the main source of tce in the aquifer and the δ13c tce enrichment corresponds better to the actual degradation at the level of the aquifer sample 3 4 2 can mass destruction in the aquitard be estimated with csia data it remains the question whether locally obtained d rayleigh values from the aquifer can be used in assessing the overall tce mass decrease as occurred in the aquitard which would be highly valuable for estimating remediation time frames for this analysis we employ two additional concepts the total mass decrease of tce versus the one of the tracer as occurred in the model at a certain distance downgradient of the source for 1 the entire depth of the aquitard d aquitard and 2 the entire depth of the aquifer aquitard aquifer system d system these mass decreases are calculated from the ratio of tce mass versus the mass of the non degradative tracer with similar properties as tce following eq 16 d system and d aquitard are compared at both 2 m and 95 m from the source to d rayleigh and to the true extent of degradation d sample both obtained at the bottom of the aquifer fig 7 during the loading phase and near the source both the lack of detectable δ13c tce enrichment and the high tce concentration levels prevent d rayleigh and d sample to depart from 0 fig 7 black and cyan lines respectively however the large d system and d aquitard values of 15 and 70 respectively fig 7a red and blue dashed lines respectively point to tce mass decrease in both the aquitard and the aquifer during the loading phase and away from the source 95 m d rayleigh increases soon after the arrival of the plume but underestimates d sample considerably at year 10 fig 7b d rayleigh even more strongly underestimates d aquitard at year 10 d rayleigh is in the range of d system but those similar values are coincidental as d system depends among others on the thickness of the plume although δ13c tce enrichment is detectable in the aquifer already in the loading phase d rayleigh values may give pessimistic views on the actual high degree of mass destruction in the aquitard d aquitard once the source is removed after 10 years d aquitard quickly increases both near and away from the source as a result of the continuous tce degradation in the aquitard without further admixing of non degraded tce from the source the poorly degraded tce mass in the aquifer is flushed by clean water therefore the mass remaining in the system is mostly contained in the reactive aquitard and d system converges towards d aquitard both d system and d aquitard are large due to the ongoing degradation in the aquitard both d sample and d rayleigh in the aquifer are now influenced only by the back diffusing tce and rapidly increase similarly to d aquitard once the source is removed degradation assessment through csia is improved due to the enriched isotope signature of the back diffusing tce which interestingly provides an insight to the state of degradation in the aquitard quickly after source removal tce mass effectively decreased in the aquifer system and d rayleigh provides a conservative estimate of the state of degradation 3 5 sensitivity analysis of degradation assessment the results of a sensitity analysis of key model parameters on cimb and θ values are shown and discussed in detail in the appendix s13 the main outcomes are reported here with respect to cimb the most influential parameters appear to be the aquitard f oc fig s10c and aquitard thickness fig s10e cimb is sensitive to the spatial separation of the depleted daughter products from their more enriched precursors as discussed before especially during the release phase a higher aquitard f oc therefore yields a larger cimb enrichment noteworthy also without sorption the cimb is predicted to enrich in later stages of the release phase probably this is caused by the loss of depleted daughter products which have diffused through the aquitard and reached the lower aquifer with respect to aquitard thickness a thinner aquitard results probably in an increased mass loss of depleted daughter products to the underlying aquifer while the more enriched precursors sorb stronger and are still present in thinner aquitards during the back diffusion phase causing a strong cimb enrichment preferential mass loss of depleted daughter products to the underlying aquifer is thus another phenomenon contributing to high cimb enrichments that could be observed in overlying aquifers the cimb of samples taken near aquitards is in most cases not a reliable indicator of the occurrence of alternative degradation pathways besides reductive dechlorination like oxidation the sensitivity analysis further shows that rayleigh based estimates of degradation are always conservative moreover we show that both δ13c tce enrichment prior to source remediation and a sudden change in δ13c values once the source is remediated are to be expected under many different field conditions the rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the extent of tce degradation in aquifer samples especially during the loading phase and for conditions leading to long remediation time frames low groundwater flow velocity strong sorption in the aquitard thicker aquitards 3 6 model limitations the simulations required simplifications which influence the results the key assumptions concern mostly reaction i e the simulation of linear sorption and of first order and uniform degradation kinetics in the aquitard diffusion related assumptions are also discussed their implications on the main results are described in this section as presented in the method section the model simulates linear sorption of chlorinated ethenes in aquitards sorption is site specific and while ces sorption was near linear in natural clayey tills lu et al 2011 tce sorption was best represented with freundlich isotherms in several clay rich aquitards in a prior study allen king et al 1996 freundlich or langmuir sorption behavior implies that high ce concentrations compared to the sorption site concentration would overwhelm the sorption capacity of the aquitard the δ13c patterns of the ces would therefore tend towards the patterns observed in the absence of sorption as in fig 9c and 10c a non linear sorption behavior would mainly limit the cimb enrichment induced by the different sorption potentials of the ces first order kinetics were assumed for simplifying the transport model the high source concentration calls for monod kinetics in which case degradation at the high ce concentration levels would comparatively be slower than in our simulation in our simulations slower degradation rates lead to better rayleigh based degradation assessment and to lesser increase of the cimb during the release phase therefore our simulations provide a higher range of the overall impact of the aquitard on the csia data our assumption of biodegradation occurring throughout the aquitard either uniform or non uniform as linear decreasing rate constants yielded different csia patterns in the aquifer than under the assumption of a thin bioactive zone at the top of the aquitard except for the jump in isotope ratios after source release note that resulting csia patterns could be similar in case of abiotic rd ces can degrade abiotically in contact with ferrous minerals in aquitards made of clayey soils or rock matrix schaefer 2016 schaefer et al 2017 while several parameters such as the magnetite susceptibility or the contact surface might influence degradation rates schaefer 2016 schaefer et al 2017 those parameters are not necessarily related to the aquitard depth and degradation rate constants might be more uniform across such an aquitard clearly more research is needed to the depth distribution of bioactivity and chemical reactivity in aquitards both for interpretation of csia data and for assessing remediation time frames the aquifer could also be sufficiently oxic to oxidize the daughter products diffusing out of the aquitard the detection of enrichment of δ13c tce in the absence of daughter compounds could be confused for tce oxidation in the aquifer provided chlorine isotope enrichment factors for tce cometabolism are available the study of combined carbon and chlorine csia data could prevent this uncertainty abe et al 2009 wiegert et al 2012 for instance as the slopes of dce carbon and chlorine csia data differ for biotic and abiotic reductive degradation combined carbon and chlorine csia was employed to determine dce degradation pathways at a field site audí miró et al 2015 the study of carbon and chlorine isotope ratios is therefore promising for pathway distinction in this case finally the ε diffusion values of dce vc and ethene were estimated based on the literature the variations of ε diffusion had little impact on both the cimb and θ provided they are in the selected range an improved estimate of ε diffusion values will not change the implications of the simulations additionally a lower τ app value as suggested by wanner and coworkers for the aquitard would reduce the distance travelled in the aquitard by the ces within the simulation time and reduce the diffusion induced isotope effect 4 summary and implications scenario simulations performed with a reactive transport model illustrate the potential of csia data to detect and quantify naturally occurring reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes ces in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system the model input parameters were based on an extensive literature review during presence of a tce dnapl source tce sequential reductive dechlorination to ethene in the underlying reactive aquitard enhances tce diffusion from the aquifer to the aquitard a resulting δ13c tce enrichment of a few permil δ13c 2 is detectable in the aquifer near the aquitard while in the absence of degradation δ13c tce enrichment induced by tce diffusion to the aquitard is negligible this signifies that before source removal large δ13c tce enrichment is unlikely to be attributable to degradation only in the aquitard but would correspond to degradation at the aquifer level after source removal the diffusion of all ces out of the aquitard is accompanied by a quick and steady increase of the δ13c of all ces and ethene with time and a decreasing δ13c of all ces with distance from the source these characteristic csia patterns during the loading and releases phases contrast strongly to those associated with reductive dechlorination occurring in the aquifer only these characteristic aquitard degradation patterns remain visible when degradation co occurs in the aquifer and could serve as a line of evidence for degradation in the aquitard the sudden jump in isotope ratios in the aquifer after source removal was recognizable in most of the simulations during the sensitivity analysis suggesting that practitioners could use this line of evidence at many sites for effective dnapl source removal wanner et al 2018b our simulated csia patterns differ from those found in the modelling study of wanner et al 2018b where it was assumed that major tce degradation only occurred in centimeters to decimeters thick bioactive zones at the top of aquitards under those conditions δ13c tce did not further increase over time after the initial jump that occurred after source removal and δ13c tce also slightly increased instead of decreased downgradient these aquifer csia patterns are characteristic for aquitards where bioactivity drops to zero already at shallow depth in a more recent study it was shown that bioactivity can spread deeper into an aquitard and rate constants decrease near linearly below a certain depth wanner et al 2018b we demonstrate that also in the case of non uniform degradation similar csia patterns are expected as in the case of uniform degradation provided that the aquitard remains sufficiently bioactive or reactive in the case of abiotic degradation until ces spreading depths csia patterns during the release phase are thus also informative over aquitard reactivity with depth note that our predicted characteristic spatiotemporal csia patterns assuming relatively steady reactivity with depth could also be representative for abiotic chemical reductive dechlorination in aquitards where chemical reactivity as content of reactive minerals is likely to be relatively uniformly distributed the carbon isotope mass balance cimb is influenced by the spatial separation of the ces and ethene during transport during the release phase the cimb increases in the upper aquifer as a result of the relatively limited back diffusion of depleted daughter products while this is the case also when degradation occurs only in the aquifer the cimb increase is stronger when degradation occurs only in the aquitard the cimb increase also occurs but to a lesser extent when vc is the end product of degradation as such it only occurs for a short period when dce stalls the cimb increase is strongest for thinner sorbing aquitards unfortunately for degradation monitoring such increase could be confused with the degradation of the ces through other pathways overestimating the daughter products degradation is problematic as daughter products in the aquitard can act as a new contaminant source during the loading phase application of the rayleigh equation to δ13c tce data sampled in the aquifer strongly underestimates tce degradation in the aquitard provided the aquifer is unreactive within only a few years after source removal the precision of rayleigh based degradation quantification is improved to reasonable levels of underestimation factor 1 25 and seems to well represent the extent of mass destruction in the aquitard at this stage unfortunately conditions increasing remediation timeframes such as a higher f oc in the aquitard thicker aquitards or a slower groundwater velocity increase degradation underestimation especially before source remediation sorption and diffusion induced isotope fractionations have limited impact on tce degradation assessment scenario modelling provides insights into the potential of aquifer csia data for monitoring the reactivity of an aquitard the study of a simplified conceptual site could be extended to more complex aquifer geometry for instance multiple reactive clay beds of different thickness and lengths further work including experimental work should address the potential of chlorine and hydrogen isotope fractionation in identifying aquitard degradation and also to distinct between biological and abiotic degradation that might co occur in aquitards wanner et al 2018a further experimental research to both biological and chemical aquitard reactivity with depth is

1564,back diffusion of chlorinated ethenes ces from low permeability layers lpls causes contaminant persistence long after the primary spill zones have disappeared naturally occurring degradation in lpls lowers remediation time frames but its assessment through sediment sampling is prohibitive in conventional remediation projects scenario simulations were performed with a reactive transport model pht3d in flopy accounting for isotope effects associated with degradation sorption and diffusion to evaluate the potential of csia data from aquifers in assessing degradation in aquitards the model simulated a trichloroethylene tce dnapl and its pollution plume within an aquifer aquitard aquifer system sequential reductive dechlorination to ethene and sorption were uniform in the aquitard and did not occur in the aquifer after 10 years of loading the aquitard through diffusion from the plume subsequent source removal triggered release of tce by back diffusion in the upper aquifer during the loading phase δ13c tce was slightly enriched up to 2 due to diffusion effects stimulated by degradation in the aquitard in the upper aquifer during the release phase i source removal triggered a huge δ13c increase especially for higher ces ii moreover downstream decreasing isotope ratios caused by downgradient later onset of the release phase with temporal increasing isotope ratios reflect aquitard degradation as opposed to downstream increasing and temporally constant isotope ratios in reactive aquifers and iii the carbon isotope mass balance cimb enriched up to 4 as lower ces more depleted less sorbing have been transported deeper into the aquitard thus enriched cimb does not indicate oxidative transformation in this system the cimb enrichment enhanced with more sorption and lower aquitard thickness thin aquitards are quicker flushed from lower ces leading to faster cimb enrichment over time cimb enrichment is smaller or nearly absent when daughter products accumulate aquifer csia patterns indicative of aquitard degradation were similar in case of linear decreasing rate constants but contrasted with previous simulations assuming a thin bioactive zone the rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the extent of tce degradation in aquifer samples especially during the loading phase and for conditions leading to long remediation time frames low groundwater flow velocity thicker aquitards strong sorption in the aquitard the rayleigh equation provides a good and useful picture on aquitard degradation during the release phase throughout the sensitivity

aquifer above maximum concentration limits mcls for decades after source removal parker et al 2008 yang et al 2015 usual remediation technologies are not applicable to low permeability layers notably due to their inherent low transmissivity khan et al 2004 fortunately recent studies show that ces biotic reductive dechlorination can take place in low permeability layers despite the small pore size chambon et al 2010 damgaard et al 2013a 2013b manoli et al 2012 takeuchi et al 2011 verce et al 2015 at some sites low permeability layers present better conditions for reductive degradation rd than the transmissive zone parker et al 2008 petitta et al 2013 wanner et al 2016 consequently natural attenuation in the low permeability layers may naturally mitigate back diffusion and thereby limit

parker 2005 filippini et al 2016 parker et al 2004 compound specific isotope analysis csia of ces which is increasingly employed for mna at field sites could potentially help degradation assessment in

leads to enrichment in heavy carbon isotopes 13c of the degrading compound hunkeler et al 2011b 1999 the degree of carbon isotope enrichment is influenced by both the advancement of the reaction and the kinetic isotope fractionation factor characteristic of the degradation reaction and therefore informs on the extent of degradation abe and hunkeler 2006 hunkeler et al 1999 van breukelen 2007 reaction products are initially depleted in 13c while the weighted sum of the carbon isotope ratios of the ces carbon isotope mass balance cimb is theoretically constant during reductive dechlorination in batch experiments aeppli et al 2010 bloom et al 2000 hunkeler et al 1999 the combination of these csia tools proved itself powerful for detection and quantification of ces degradation in the subsurface höhener 2016 höhener et al 2015 hunkeler et al 2011a van breukelen et al 2005 wiegert et al 2013 2012 one potential complication however is that several non destructive processes might also lead to isotope fractionation as shown in small scale lab studies and aquifer scale model simulations those processes include highly relevant processes in low permeability layers

diffusion periods in clay wanner and hunkeler 2015 sorption enriches chlorinated hydrocarbons in 13c with depth wanner et al 2017 while the effects are small compared to rd sorption induced isotope fractionation for instance could lead to significant enrichment in the aquitard wanner et al 2017 both numerical and analytical modelling were proven useful to the study of volatile compounds or tracer concentrations in the subsurface during back diffusion processes adamson et al 2016 2015 liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 yang et al 2015 modelling studies were shown essential for investigating aquifer parameters influencing tce plume tailing carey et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2015 2014 yang et al 2017 reactive transport models rtms extended with isotope fractionation were employed to retrieve carbon isotope patterns of ces during combined degradation and transport in sandy aquifers höhener 2016 höhener et al 2015 höyng et al 2015 hunkeler et al 2009 1999 van breukelen et al 2005 those models were extended in order to include isotope fractionation induced by non degradative processes eckert et al 2013 höhener et al 2017 rolle et al 2010 van breukelen et al 2005 van breukelen and prommer 2008 such models were also applied to the study of combined reaction degradation or sorption and diffusion in aquitards wanner et al 2017 2016 and aquifer aquitard systems wanner et al 2018a 2018b recently modelling of csia data enabled the differentiation and quantification of two specific degradation pathways of chlorohydrocarbons in an aquitard wanner et al 2018a the isotope ratios of volatile organic compounds in the transmissive zone in the vicinity of a non reactive aquitard were studied through such rtms diffusion towards low permeability layers was shown to have a potential for carbon isotope enrichment within the aquifer labolle et al 2008 the latter being likely attenuated and negligible compared to potential degradation induced enrichment that could occur in the transmissive zone also after back diffusion xu et al 2017 however processes leading to stronger isotope fractionation in the aquitard such as degradation could potentially lead to detectable enrichment at the aquifer level wanner et al 2018b xu et al 2017 moreover diffusion of daughter products from the low permeability layers to the aquifer was shown to contribute to plume tailing rasa et al 2011 wanner et al 2018b it is relevant to investigate whether any csia data of tce or of its degradation products sampled in the aquifer could be used for degradation assessment despite the low concentration levels recently wanner et al 2018b demonstrated with a modelling study that tce to cdce degradation in shallow bioactive zones of aquitards could cause unique csia patterns in above lying aquifers this study extends to the aforementioned work and sets out to illustrate to which extent spatial and temporal carbon csia patterns could be informative of ces reductive degradation in aquitards despite the impacts of non destructive processes on both the concentration and isotope ratios to this end we apply virtual experiments i e run reactive transport models fed with sets of representative model parameters for common field conditions for example the hydraulic parameters chosen for the model were based on previous hydrological models predicting plume tailings for different types of low permeability layers following up to the work of wanner et al 2018b we simulated the full sequence of reductive dechlorination assessed the effect of thinner aquifers and deeper bioactive zones and evaluated the performance of the rayleigh equation and cimb as common csia data interpretation tools the main objectives of this modelling study are 1 development of a model that simulates carbon csia and concentration patterns in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system before and after source removal and 2 evaluating the potential of csia data to detect reductive dechlorination and the extent of tce degradation as occurring in the aquitard while setting a sensitivity analysis on model parameters with the sensitivity analysis we demonstrate the effect of critical model parameters like aquitard thickness and degree of sorption on simulation results the performance of the rayleigh equation to determine tce degradation and the use of the carbon isotope mass balance under these specific conditions is also assessed finally we provide recommendations to practitioners on how csia data from aquifers can be used and interpreted for the detection and quantification of reductive dechlorination in low permeability layers 2 methods 2 1 general model concept fig 1 represents the general model concept for the base case scenario consisting of a 100 m long and 10 m high cross sectional domain a 1 m thick clay aquitard separates an 8 m thick upper sand aquifer from a lower aquifer of which only the upper 1 m is modelled the model simulates two temporal phases a loading phase during which dissolution of a tce dnapl source present at the bottom of the upper aquifer leads to tce advection through the aquifer following groundwater flow and tce diffusion into the clay aquitard followed by a release phase which focusses on back diffusion of ces from the clay aquitard to the aquifer after the dnapl is removed after 10 years adamson et al 2016 a natural hydraulic gradient of 0 0042 m m 1 was imposed through the boundary conditions leading together with the selected permeability and porosity see later to a groundwater flow velocity of 0 12 m d 1 in the sand aquifers for simplicity sorption of ces is assumed to occur only in the aquitard likewise sequential reductive dechlorination from tce to dce vc and finally ethene is only assumed to occur with a uniform rate constant across the aquitard discussed further in section 2 4 localised reductive dechlorination rd in the aquitard in an otherwise unreactive aquifer is likely as the aquifer unlike the aquitard can be too oxic to host reductive processes as it was previously observed at the borden site wanner et al 2016 aquitards usually contain higher contents of soil organic matter that can potentially act as electron donor in reductive dechlorination wanner et al 2016 the model is described in detail in the following 2 2 modelling approach the multicomponent reactive transport code pht3d prommer et al 2001 was applied using the flopy python package bakker et al 2016 as interface pht3d allows combining the geochemical model phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 1999 with the 3 d multicomponent transport model mt3dms zheng et al 2012 the implicit tvd method was used similarly as in prior publications hunkeler et al 2009 van breukelen et al 2017 2005 phreeqc 2 was employed for modelling carbon isotope fractionation during sequential degradation of chlorinated ethenes mt3dms has been applied before to simulate back diffusion and has been validated with analytical solutions and experimental data chapman et al 2012 each carbon isotopologue was simulated with different values of effective diffusion coefficients d e solid phase organic carbon water partitioning sorption coefficients k oc and first order degradation rate constants k the selection procedure of the aforementioned model parameters is elaborated below 2 3 general model settings the model grid for the base case consists of 200 columns 200 rows and 1 layer grid discretization is of 0 5 m in the horizontal direction columns and of 0 05 m in the vertical direction rows fig 1 results obtained with grids of higher and lower resolutions are presented for comparison in fig s2 in the appendix for simplicity the porosity was set to 0 35 for both the aquitard and aquifers this value is typical for unconsolidated sands albeit at the lower end of clay layers the dry bulk density was set to 1 855 kg l 1 throughout the system the aquifer and aquitard were given a hydraulic conductivity of 3650 m y 1 and 1 m y 1 respectively the low hydraulic conductivity of the clay aquitard leads to negligible flow longitudinal and vertical transverse dispersivities were set to 1 0 m and 1 5 mm respectively these values are in the range of previously reported dispersivities values of plumes in sandy aquifers garabedian et al 1991 klenk and grathwohl 2002 the selected grid spacing above and time step 1 day insure satisfying grid peclet and courant criteria aqueous diffusion coefficient d w values were calculated as 5 9 10 10 m2 s 1 6 9 10 10 m2 s 1 9 7 10 10 m2 s 1 and 1 3 10 9 m2 s 1 for tce dce vc and ethene respectively as elaborated in section 2 5 the fraction of organic content f oc of the clay aquitard was set to 0 0033 0 33 a representative value for fluvial sediments griffioen et al 2016 together with the selected values of other model parameter a retardation factor of 3 5 for tce was obtained similar to prior back diffusion studies carey et al 2015 parker et al 2008 the calculation of the retardation factors is elaborated in section 2 6 during the simulations linear sorption is assumed the high ces concentrations following the dissolution of the dnapl could saturate the sorption capacity in which case freundlich or langmuir sorption isoterms would provide more realistic results the implications of the model simplifications are described further in the discussion 2 4 pollutant source and degradation a tce dnapl source was simulated as a constant concentration boundary condition at the lower 2 m of the upper aquifer for 10 years fig 1 such source positioning was previously used in the study of back diffusion of both napl and dnapl xu et al 2017 the tce source concentration 0 6 g l 1 was about half the tce solubility 1 28 g l 1 and 6 105 times larger than the typical carbon csia quantification limit 1 μg l 1 concentrations and isotope ratios are shown only for concentrations above this quantification limit the source was given a constant isotope composition δ13c tcesource of 30 setting a constant isotope ratio for a dissolving dnapl is acceptable as the model does not simulate degradation in the sand aquifer and therefore no weathering of the dnapl hunkeler et al 2004 hwang et al 2013 the three carbon isotopologues of each ce and ethene are simulated as done before for chlorine isotopologues hunkeler et al 2009 the tce carbon isotopologue concentrations in the source were calculated from the tce concentration and isotope ratio of the source as described in appendix section s3 after a simulation time of 10 years the loading phase was stopped by setting the concentration of each ce at the constant concentration boundary condition to 0 g l 1 biological reductive dechlorination in the aquitard degrades sequentially tce to dce vc and finally ethene the model assumes that only the major cis dce isomer is formed first order degradation rate constants for biotic reductive dechlorination are selected in the line with the values employed in van breukelen et al 2005 i e 1 y 1 0 2 y 1 and 0 2 y 1 for tce dce and vc respectively table s4 in appendix although the high source concentration applied calls for monod kinetics bekins et al 1997 first order kinetics often used at field sites was chosen for simplicity and also further additional complexity such as microbial growth inhibition and donor limitation chambon et al 2013 was ignored degradation rate constants were assumed to remain constant with depth in the base case model as opposed to two recent studies where bioactivity was assumed to be i retrained a centimeters thin bioactive zone at the top of a thick aquitard as modelled by exponentially declining rate constants with depth wanner et al 2018b or ii declining gradually with depth as modelled by nearly linearly decreasing rate constants till about 1 m depth wanner et al 2018a in those previous studies likely the microorganisms distribution lead to decline of the degradation rate constants with depth in the one study the decreasing availability of nutrients and electron donors diffusing from the aquifer to the aquitard likely influenced the degradation rate constants wanner et al 2018b in the other study the limited presence of microorganisms responsible for degradation of the chlorohydrocarbons of concern deeper than 0 35 cm together with the near linearly decreasing degradation rate constants below this depth could indicate that transport of microorganisms remains a potential limitation for biotic degradation across thick aquitards wanner et al 2018a for thin aquitards 1 m with rich organic carbon content the contact with aquifers both above and below is likely to allow a more homogeneous bacterial distribution than for the aquitards described in those prior studies moreover several bacterial strains including dehaloccocoides spp a strain able of complete tce to ethene degradation were present across the studied depth of 1 1 m wanner et al 2018a unfortunately at this stage studies on degradation and bacterial activity in aquitards are still limited the choice of low uniform degradation rate constants in the aquitard is therefore a simplification which could be refined later once bacterial degradation in aquitard is better understood each isotopologue degrades with a slightly different rate constant leading to isotope fractionation of the ces for carbon this fractionation is usually modelled as a bulk isotope fractionation i e simplifying the model to the evolution of the compound s fraction of the light and the heavy isotope van breukelen et al 2017 2005 for this isotopologue model we express the respective degradation rates of each isotopologue employing the bulk kinetic carbon isotope enrichment factor ε degradation 1 d c ll dt k c ll 2 d c lh dt k ε degradation 1 c lh 3 d c hh dt k 2 ε degradation 1 c hh where ll c lh c and hh c are the isotopologue concentrations moles of the carbon isotopologues containing two light ll carbon isotopes one light l and one heavy h isotope lh and two heavy isotopes hh respectively and k y 1 the first order degradation rate constant carbon isotope fractionation of chlorinated ethenes during biotic reductive dechlorination has been intensively studied for this model average values of bulk carbon isotope enrichment factors ε degradation obtained with microcosm experiments were used for the base case scenario i e 12 21 and 23 table s3 during biotic reductive dechlorination of tce dce and vc respectively the variability of enrichment factors reflects the diversity of degradative microorganisms for instance ε degradation during tce reductive dechlorination was found to vary from 3 3 to 18 9 cichocka et al 2008 we restrained from assessing this variability on the model outcome testing only a single lower value for each ε degradation in an additional simulation in section 3 5 2 5 diffusion and diffusion induced isotope fractionation aqueous diffusion coefficients of each ce isotopologue were acquired from the aqueous diffusion coefficients of the ces each ce s aqueous diffusion coefficient d w was first calculated through worch 1993 4 d w 3 595 10 14 t η t m ce 0 53 where t is the water temperature k set for the model to 283 15 k 10 c η t the water s viscosity at t pa s and m ce is the ce s weighted molar mass using isotopologues abundances at 0 table s5 in appendix each isotopologue was then assigned a specific diffusion coefficient to model diffusion induced isotope fractionation recent work showed that for a ce with n isotopologues isotopologue specific aqueous diffusion coefficients d w n of the isotopologue n are defined by jin et al 2014 5 d w n d w i n a i m i m n β where a i and m i are the relative abundance and the mass of the isotopologue i respectively and β is an empirical coefficient determined experimentally for each compound the abundances at 0 and masses of the isotopologues given in table s5 in appendix were then employed to calculate the diffusion coefficients of each isotopologue the diffusion coefficient of the compound will be slightly modified by the change in its isotopologue composition measurements obtained with a modified stroke s diffusion cell wanner and hunkeler 2015 yielded β values of 0 029 0 008 and 0 024 0 002 for carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation of tce respectively through the modelling of diffusion experiments in gel diffusion tubes a slightly higher β value for chlorine isotope enrichment of tce was obtained 0 043 0 008 while of dce 0 088 0 015 jin et al 2014 the difference between tce and dce might be explained by the role of the hydration shell in the extent of diffusion induced isotope fractionation jin et al 2014 in the present model we used the β values reported by wanner et al wanner and hunkeler 2015 considering the similarity of β values for carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation of tce we assumed that the same applies to dce therefore we used β 0 088 for the carbon isotope effects of dce no experimental β values for vc and ethene are available for those compounds we used the value of 0 088 given that dce in the closest available analogue for these compounds jin et al 2014 resulting diffusion induced carbon isotope enrichment factors ε diffusion are 0 2 0 9 1 4 and 3 1 for tce dce vc and ethene respectively table s4 only 1 d w lh d w ll is given here for simplicity where d w lh and d w ll are the aqueous diffusion coefficients for the isotopologue containing one heavy and one light and two light isotopes respectively table s5 in appendix lists the isotopologue specific aqueous diffusion coefficients in porous media molecules diffuse around the sediment grains of the rock matrix therefore the effective diffusion coefficient d e is smaller than d w in order to account for the added travel distance d e was taken as d e d w τ app 7 where d w is defined for each isotopologue using eq 4 and τ app is the apparent diffusion tortuosity coefficient also referred to as the tortuosity factor carey et al 2016 the coefficient τ app is often written as a function of the accessible porosity for simplicity boving and grathwohl 2001 recent work suggests that the coefficient τ app is correlated to the permeability not to the porosity of a media with an average τ app of 0 33 for low permeability media carey et al 2016 fitting of tce diffusion profiles in clay suggested much lower τ app values 0 13 wanner and hunkeler 2015 0 03 wanner et al 2016 in the present study τ app is taken equal to the porosity across the model 0 35 in the base case scenario 2 6 sorption and sorption induced isotope fractionation the retardation factor r represents the degree of retardation of a compound with respect to the local groundwater flow velocity and is calculated as follows 6 r 1 ρ b n k oc f oc where ρ b is the bulk density across the aquifer aquitard aquifer system kg l 1 k oc is the solid phase organic carbon water partition coefficient l kg 1 and n the porosity k oc values are usually derived from its correlation with the octanol water partitioning coefficient k ow lu et al 2011 nguyen et al 2005 the present study applied eq 7 to the logk ow values of 2 47 1 98 1 62 and 1 27 for tce dce vc and ethene respectively following the approach and the values reported in van breukelen et al 2005 the k oc values are then of 142 l kg 1 75 l kg 1 39 l kg 1 and 27 l kg 1 for tce dce vc and ethene respectively table s4 valsaraj et al 1999 7 k oc 10 0 81 k ow 0 56 the present simulation sets f oc to 0 3 in the aquitard so tce retardation is of 3 5 as in prior modelling studies of aquifer aquitard systems see table s1 in appendix the selected f oc value results in retardation factors r of 2 3 1 8 and 1 5 for dce vc and ethene respectively after applying eq 6 and eq 7 sorption induced isotope fractionation results from the slightly stronger sorption to organic matter of molecules with light isotopes than those with heavy isotopes kopinke et al 2005 the fractionation factor for linear equilibrium sorption α sorption has been defined as the ratio of the k oc of the heavy h k oc and the one of the light isotope l k oc höhener and yu 2012 kopinke et al 2005 van breukelen and prommer 2008 wanner et al 2017 the resulting sorption induced isotope fractionation is included in the model by attributing different k oc values to each isotopologue see table s5 in appendix the calculation of isotopologue specific k oc values was inspired by höhener and yu 2012 we extended their approach for comparing data of differently deuterated compounds to carbon isotopologues for which no specific relation was yet developed the resulting relation is 8 α lh sorption α hh sorption 1 2 where lh α sorption and hh α sorption are the sorption induced fractionation factors of the isotopologue containing one light l and one heavy h and two heavy hh carbon isotopes respectively the k oc values of the two isotopologues containing at least one heavy carbon atom can be calculated from 9 k lh oc α lh sorption k ll oc 10 k hh oc α lh sorption 2 k ll oc where ll k oc lh k oc and hh k oc are the k oc values of the isotopologue containing two light carbon isotopes one light and one heavy and two heavy respectively isotopologue specific k oc values were estimated using the fractionation factor α sorption taken from the literature see below and the reported k oc values ll k oc k oc was assumed which is an acceptable approximation considering the large variation of k oc an example of the calculation of the isotopologue specific k oc is presented in the appendix section s5 and the values are reported in table s5 simulations of sorption induced isotope fractionation during advection with an analytical solution van breukelen and prommer 2008 yielded identical results for the isotope and this isotopologue approach see fig s1 in appendix laboratory experiments on homogeneous media yielded sorption induced carbon isotope enrichment factors ε sorption α sorption 1 for 6 different organic compounds ε sorption in the range of 0 9 to 0 1 imfeld et al 2014 unfortunately little is known about the specific ε sorption values of ces only ε sorption of tce is available 0 52 0 19 and 0 26 0 10 based on free energy linear relationships höhener and yu 2012 a recent multi step sorption study of dcm and 1 2 dca reports ε sorption values of about 0 54 and 0 4 respectively wanner et al 2017 in the base case scenario lh ε sorption for all ces and ethene was taken at the upper predicted range 0 5 for tce consequently hh ε sorption was of 1 2 7 post modelling calculations 2 7 1 isotope ratio the heavy to light carbon isotope ratios of a sample r h l are calculated from the concentrations of the isotopologues as follow 11 r h l 2 c hh c lh 2 c ll c lh the isotope ratios are reported in the usual delta notation δ13c the δ13c is defined as δ 13 c r r l r vpdb 1 where rvpdb is the carbon isotope ratio of an international standard isotope ratios are calculated only when the ces concentration is above isotope quantification limit taken as 1 μg l for all ces in this study 2 7 2 carbon isotope mass balance the carbon isotope mass balance cimb is the concentration weighted average isotope ratio of the ces and ethene combined 12 cimb δ 13 c i c i c i where δ13ci and ci are carbon isotope ratios and concentrations respectively of the ces and ethene cimb is not calculated when any of the ces concentrations are below the minimum quantification limit for δ13c taken as 1 μg l 1 for all ces for simplicity the concept of cimb has shown useful in other studies aeppli et al 2010 amaral et al 2011 hunkeler et al 1999 as its enrichment points to for example oxidative transformation whereas reductive dechlorination yields constant cimb the cimb can also be calculated excluding ethene which δ13c is not always available in which case constant cimb would be a signal of a lack of vc transformation to ethene for instance 2 7 3 performance of the rayleigh equation to estimate tce degradation the rayleigh equation is commonly applied to estimate the extent of biodegradation of a compound based on its degree of isotope enrichment and the applicable isotope enrichment factor hunkeler et al 2002 13 d rayleigh 1 exp 1 ε degradation ln δ 13 c tce 1 δ 13 c tce source 1 where d rayleigh is the rayleigh based estimate of tce degradation and ε degradation is the bulk carbon enrichment factor during tce degradation a d rayleigh of 0 1 signifies that 10 of the initial tce was degraded the true extent of biodegradation as occurred in the model d sample is calculated from the simulated tce concentration and the concentration of a non degrading tracer with otherwise similar characteristics to tce d sample is calculated for a cell i of the non sorbing aquifer as follows 14 d sample tce i tracer i where tce i and tracer i are the tce and tracer concentrations respectively in cell i the rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the true extent of degradation abe and hunkeler 2006 höyng et al 2015 van breukelen and prommer 2008 but could under some conditions also overestimate if δ13c enrichment resulting from non degradative processes such as sorption at plume fronts or diffusion in plume cores would be attributed to degradation höhener and yu 2012 kopinke et al 2005 van breukelen and prommer 2008 van breukelen and rolle 2012 in order to decrease below the mcl of 5 μg l the initial tce concentration of 0 6 g l must be reduced by 99 999 at such a high number of decimals the ratio of the extents of degradation d rayleigh d sample would be a poor quantifier of the underestimation at overall high extents of degradation using instead the ratio of the rate constants as a measure of the underestimation as done in previous studies lutz et al 2013 van breukelen and prommer 2008 van breukelen and rolle 2012 circumvents this issue as it equals the ratio of the logarithms of the residual fractions given that the rate constant k of a first order reaction satisfies k t ln 1 d where d is the extent of degradation at the time t in the present study the deviation between the true extent of degradation and the rayleigh based estimate is addressed through the following measure θ which quantifies the underestimation of the true first order degradation rate constant k sample by the rayleigh based estimate of the first order degradation rate constant k rayleigh the values of the rates themselves are not the subject of this paper 15 θ ln 1 d rayleigh ln 1 d sample k rayleigh k sample a θ of 1 signifies that both rate constants are equal i e no underestimation of d sample by d rayleigh a θ of 0 8 indicates that the estimate k rayleigh is 1 25 times smaller than the true k sample whereas a θ of 0 1 means that k rayleigh is 10 times smaller than the true k sample i e d rayleigh strongly underestimates d sample θ is calculated only for significant δ13c tce enrichment i e the isotopic shift δ13c between δ13c tce and δ13c tcesource is beyond 1 a value below a threshold of 2 cannot be taken with certainty as an indication of degradation considering the analytical uncertainty of carbon csia and site heterogeneity hunkeler et al 2008 however in practice enrichment beyond 1 is considered to be an indication of degradation two additional concepts are defined for the sake of this study to estimate the true degradation effect at a larger scale than the scale of a sample the total mass decrease of tce versus the one of the tracer as occurred in the model is calculated at a certain distance downgradient for 1 the entire depth of the aquitard d aquitard and 2 the entire depth of the aquifer aquitard aquifer system d system d aquitard and d system are therefore the ratios of tce and the tracer s mass across a column of the model as in eq 16 16 d 1 i n 1 ρ b η f oc k oc tce v i η tce i 1 ρ b η f oc k oc tce v i η tracer i where n is the number of rows in the aquitard or in the aquifer column respectively tce i and tracer i the concentration for this column at the row i mg l 1 f oc is the local fraction of organic carbon only different between the aquifer and the aquitard η is the porosity dimentionless k oc tce the solid phase organic carbon water partition coefficients of tce identical for the tracer l kg 1 and ρ b is the bulk density v i the the cells volume m3 the length and width of the model cells are always the same but the height of the cells varies accross depth d aquifer and d aquitard are 0 when there is no degradation and 100 when degradation is maximal 3 results and discussion 3 1 complete model including ces degradation loading phase the base case scenario is employed to simulate ces concentrations and isotope ratios following flow diffusion sorption and degradation including associated carbon isotope effects this section focusses on the loading phase until the plume is removed during the loading phase the dissolving dnapl forms a plume with high tce concentration in the aquifer the concentration gradient between the aquifer and the aquitard drives tce diffusion into the initially pristine aquitard in the aquitard transport is governed by diffusion only advective transport does not occur at the end of the loading phase in year 10 daughter products show the highest concentration a few centimeters 2 cm to 15 cm below the interface fig 2a resulting from their sequential production in the aquitard close up of the aquitard available in the appendix fig s4 the centers of the ces masses are spatially separated with ethene present the deepest followed by vc dce and tce fig 2a and b ces sequential reductive dechlorination sorption and diffusion create these patterns in concert the more dechlorinated the compound the later it is formed in the degradation sequence the less it sorbs and the faster it diffuses for instance ethene is the end product of reductive dechlorination it sorbs least and diffuses fastest compared to the other compounds whereas the peak concentration of tce in the aquitard decreases downgradient those of the daughter products remain remarkably similar fig 2a plain vs dashed lines daughter products which back diffused to upgradient parts of the aquifer are transporteddowngradient where they again diffuse into the aquitard consequently daughter product concentration peaks remain high right below the aquifer aquitard interface throughout the aquitard also away from the source dashed line fig 2a simulations allow comparing the base case scenario dysy which includes both the diffusion and sorption induced isotope fractionation effects to a model disregarding both those effects dnsn as well as two intermediary scenarios dysn and dnsy see description of these simulation codes in caption of fig 2 details of additional simulations in the absence of degradation are presented in the appendix section s7 for all scenarios including tce degradation δ13c tce enriches with depth in the aquitard with as much as 45 at 30 cm depth in year 10 fig 2c this enrichment is strongly larger than the negligible δ13c tce enrichment predicted in the absence of reductive dechlorination 0 5 fig s3c resulting solely from the combined effects of sorption and diffusion induced isotope fractionation each lesser chlorinated ethene presents a more depleted δ13c than its precursor which is the usual pattern for reductive dechlorination hunkeler and aravena 2000 slater et al 2000 van breukelen et al 2005 for the base case scenario dysy δ13c of daughter products tend to curve with depth opposed to the straight enrichment of δ13c tce after initial enrichments compared to their starting values δ13c level off and even show a declining trend deep in the aquitard fig 2c when dce or vc eventually travels ahead of its precursor the net δ13c enrichment becomes smaller eventually δ13c decreases with depth below the δ13c peaks for both the models including diffusion induced isotope fractionation fig 2c dysy and dysn the ethene δ13c pattern is different as ethene does not degrade δ13c ethene will not further enrich once it is away from its precursor vc with the selected ε diffusion ethene shows stronger depletion in the base case scenario compared to the simulation omitting diffusion induced isotope fractionation fig 2c 7 for the base case model dysy vs dnsy at 90 cm depth despite a f oc of 0 3 ε sorption itself leads to a small enrichment for all ces and is significant 2 only in the deepest parts of the aquitard fig 2c dysy vs dysn and dnsy vs dnsn in the aquifer the upwards decline of δ13c of dce vc and ethene by a few fig 2c is caused by the faster diffusion of the light isotopes following the upward concentration gradients the cimb increases just below the aquifer aquitard interface where enriched tce and dce are dominant the cimb increase results from the faster downward diffusion of the depleted daughter products fig 2c beneath the cimb strongly decreases with depth until being equal to δ13c ethene once ethene is the dominant compound depletion by about 25 at 0 9 m fig 2c the occurrence of depleted cimb was described before in simulations of ces transport and degradation through an aquifer in presence of sorption van breukelen et al 2005 the different transport velocities of the ces is the main reason for downwards cimb decrease further enhanced by diffusion induced isotope fractionation fig 2c dnsy and dnsn the most depleted cimb predicted in this simulation 55 is close to the range of the lowest reported isotope signatures of pce and tce at a field site 67 9 and 70 respectively nijenhuis et al 2013 as ces isotope profiles in aquitards are employed for retracing ces source history adamson et al 2015 such low cimb in a sorbing aquitard should not be confused for the prior presence of another strongly depleted tce spill concentration and δ13c patterns of ces across the aquifer at the end of the loading phase year 10 are presented in fig 3 daughter products accumulate in the aquifer where their concentrations increase with distance from the source fig 3a at the end of the loading phase daughter product concentrations at the bottom of the aquifer are already several orders of magnitude above the mcls mcl 70 μg l 1 for cis dce 2 μg l 1 for vc fig 3a at year 10 although no degradation occurs in the aquifer δ13c tce downgradient enrichment just above the aquifer aquitard interface is strongly larger than in absence of degradation isotope enrichment δ13c 5 vs 0 05 fig 3c and s3 g respectively tce degradation in the aquitard enhances the concentration gradient at the aquifer aquitard interface the resulting faster diffusion to the aquitard leads to a stronger isotope enrichment in the aquifer the same process leads to the increase of δ13c dce and δ13c vc with distance from the source up to 5 for dce fig 3c however δ13c ethene decreases with distance as ethene accumulates and as degradation is overall less advanced downgradient from the source fig 3c until the release phase daughter product concentrations are much lower than tce concentrations in the aquifer and δ13c tce is enriched consequently the cimb is dictated by δ13c tce at the bottom of the aquifer at the end of the loading phase and therefore enriches with distance fig 3e 3 2 complete model including ces degradation release phase after source removal the main plume is flushed away from the 100 m long stretch of aquifer by upgradient uncontaminated groundwater within about 2 7 years the groundwater flow velocity is of 44 m y 1 the tce concentration gradient is reversed and tce diffuses now back from the aquitard to the aquifer prior to source removal the high tce concentration levels forced the δ13c of ces to low values five years after source removal at year 15 δ13c values of all compounds are considerably higher than during the loading phase and are above their minimum detection limit of 1 μg l interestingly δ13c now strongly decreases downgradient fig 3d the downgradient decline is as much as 10 for dce and vc and near 30 for tce fig 3d the ongoing uniform degradation in the aquitard explains δ13c tce enrichment over time in the entire system while the overall downgradient δ13c tce depletion relates to the delay in flushing of the downgradient parts of the aquifer in appendix and discussed further in section 3 3 the temporal evolution of the ces and ethene are evaluated near the aquitard 95 m downgradient of the source the tce concentration drops below the mcl within 10 years after the source is removed fig 4 concentrations of daughter products near the aquitard also decline but slower and the accumulating product of ces sequential degradation ethene resides in the aquifer nearly as long as the non degrading tracer fig 4a vc concentration away from the source is still above its mcl at year 40 i e 30 years after source removal although tce declined below its mcl long before at year 18 fig 4a simulations of vc or dce stall presented in the appendix show that their concentrations would also remain nearly as high as that of the tracer in the aquifer fig s7 and s8 despite degradation occurs in the aquitard and not in the aquifer the potentially high concentrations and the longevity of the degradation products in the aquifer should be considered in the study of back diffusion shortly after the cleanup cimb significantly increases by 3 and remains high until the end of the simulation fig 4b also for different well screen lengths and positions fig s5 in the appendix the cimb increase points to the loss of depleted compounds from the aquifer during the release phase the more dechlorinated and more depleted compounds have been transported deeper into the aquitard see section 3 1 and do not diffuse back to the aquifer as fast as the more enriched and chlorinated compounds the difference in cimb δcimb was evaluated for several reaction chains with dce or vc as end product instead of ethene δcimb is smaller but still 1 5 after source removal when vc is the end product fig s7 δcimb decreases in a few years to near 0 when dce is the end product fig s8 at field sites cimb is expected to increase only in presence of degradation processes other than reductive dechlorination for instance dce and vc are more readily oxidizable than tce and could degrade in the aquifer provided the right conditions are met coleman et al 2002a 2002b therefore such significant cimb increase could be confused for alternative degradation pathways for the ces 3 3 distinct csia patterns in the aquifer in presence of aquitard degradation with the goal to assess spatial csia patterns characteristic of either aquitard rd or aquifer rd the base case simulation on aquitard rd was compared with another simulation where rd only occurred in the aquifer fig 5 aquifer rd causes monotonously increasing csia patterns of all compounds in downgradient direction during both the loading and release phase fig 5a b similarly as known for aquifer rd without aquitard interactions van breukelen et al 2005 strikingly downgradient csia patterns and their magnitude remain almost unaffected after source removal and remain constant in time long after source removal results not shown during the loading phase the cimb is not increasing downgradient but it slightly increases by about 0 5 during the release phase this minor cimb increase after source removal can be explained by the lower back diffusion rates of the more dechlorinated and more depleted daughter products which have penetrated deeper into the aquitard as they diffuse faster and sorb less these patterns are in strong contrast with those of uniform aquitard rd as discussed shortly before where carbon isotope ratios only limitedly increase downgradient during the loading phase whereas most strikingly after source removal huge isotope enrichment is simulated of all compounds as the aquitard serves as a reservoir of degraded ces as in both cases concentration drop during the release phase isotope ratios is more applicable to discriminate between both hypotheses furthermore the csia patterns decreasing downgradient fig 5b and downgradient cimb increase is substantial especially during the release phase with about 4 fig 5c d a simulation assuming linear decreasing degradation rate constants dropping to zero at the base of the aquitard showed similar csia patterns as the base case simulation fig s6 note that in the case bioactivity is limited to the upper centimeters of aquitards further isotope enrichment over time after the initial jump will not occur while isotope ratios will also not decrease downgradient wanner et al 2018b because the residence time of back diffusing tce in the bioactive zone is invariant interestingly csia patterns may thus inform on the depth of bioactive zones in aquitards or in general the depth of reactivity as aquitards with potentially elevated contents of iron sulfur minerals could also host chemical reductive dechlorination as ce attenuation process in the case rd occurs within the entire system both in the aquitard and the aquifer s the csia patterns become a mixture of the unique features of aquitard and aquifer rd during the loading phase downgradient csia patterns increase for the higher chlorinated ces alike aquifer rd but are more stable for lower chlorinated ces and ethene similar to aquitard rd whereas during the release phase aquifer rd shows increasing csia patterns and aquitard rd shows strongly elevated but decreasing csia patterns rd occurring within the entire system shows elevated but relatively constant csia patterns downgradient at least under the simulated conditions of spatially homogenous first order rate constants even under those conditions aquitard rd is still noticeable as csia patterns of daughter products are much more enriched than in the absence of aquitard rd notably near the source the cimb increase is in between those of purely aquitard and aquifer rd except near the source where the increase is large which differs strongly from the aquifer rd pattern concluding aquitard rd can still be clearly detected by aquifer csia in case also aquifer rd occurs because of i the significant cimb increase and especially ii the strong jump of csia ratios after source removal also near the source and iii the absence of clear increasing and possibly decreasing csia trends downgradient 3 4 performance of the rayleigh equation in assessing the extent of degradation at contaminated sites with a predominant role of aquitard rd csia of samples from conventional wells situated in the aquifer but close to the aquifer aquitard interface could detect and potentially be used to quantify the extent of degradation the base case scenario shows that aquitard rd leaves an imprint on δ13c tce in the aquifer additionally daughter products are detected in the aquifer throughout the simulation this section evaluates whether a csia calculation tool often used for biodegradation assessment at field sites the rayleigh equation provides trustworthy information on the occurrence and degree of tce degradation in the aquitard when based on csia samples from the aquifer 3 4 1 performance of the rayleigh equation for local degradation assessment the direct application of the rayleigh equation to δ13c tce data obtained from a polluted site is in theory sufficient to obtain a conservative estimate of tce degradation as occurred in the samples d rayleigh the underestimation by the rayleigh equation of the true extent of degradation for the simulated conditions can be assessed by comparing d rayleigh to the true extent of degradation d sample as both are obtained from the synthetic dataset lutz et al 2013 prior modelling studies pointed out that d rayleigh systematically underestimates the true extent of degradation under various conditions abe and hunkeler 2006 höyng et al 2015 lutz et al 2017 lutz and van breukelen 2014 van breukelen and prommer 2008 van breukelen and rolle 2012 the underestimation was then the result of the attenuation of degradation induced δ13c enrichment through mixing and dispersion of pollution plumes in aquifers at high extents of degradation for instance above 90 the ratio of the extents of degradation d rayleigh and d sample would be a poor indicator of the underestimation the ratio of the rayleigh equation estimate to the true first order degradation rate constant θ better qualifies the underestimation also at high extent of degradation see section 2 7 fig 6 illustrates the variation of θ in the upper aquifer at various elevations and distances from the source and screen lengths sampling from long well screens or near the source lowers the chance to detect significantly enriched δ13c tce either because of the high tce concentration during the loading phase or due to strong dilution during the release phase because θ is only calculated for δ13c 1 the longest time series of θ can be computed for short screens away from the source and near the aquitard fig 6 when calculated θ varies between 0 5 and 0 9 i e the rayleigh equation underestimates the real first order degradation rate constant with a factor 2 to 1 1 respectively away from the source θ is initially low and progressively decreases from 0 65 to 0 5 during the loading phase fig 6a cyan lines in this initial stage the tce concentration and its isotope ratio have plateaued while the tracer concentration keeps rising fig 4a b indicating that the true extent of degradation d sample increases consequently the gap increases between the csia based degradation estimate and the true extent of degradation causing θ to drop within 10 years after source removal θ increases to high values meaning that the rayleigh equation only slightly underestimates degradation as occurred in samples and a close estimate is obtained tce back diffusing from the aquitard where it has been partially degraded is now the main source of tce in the aquifer and the δ13c tce enrichment corresponds better to the actual degradation at the level of the aquifer sample 3 4 2 can mass destruction in the aquitard be estimated with csia data it remains the question whether locally obtained d rayleigh values from the aquifer can be used in assessing the overall tce mass decrease as occurred in the aquitard which would be highly valuable for estimating remediation time frames for this analysis we employ two additional concepts the total mass decrease of tce versus the one of the tracer as occurred in the model at a certain distance downgradient of the source for 1 the entire depth of the aquitard d aquitard and 2 the entire depth of the aquifer aquitard aquifer system d system these mass decreases are calculated from the ratio of tce mass versus the mass of the non degradative tracer with similar properties as tce following eq 16 d system and d aquitard are compared at both 2 m and 95 m from the source to d rayleigh and to the true extent of degradation d sample both obtained at the bottom of the aquifer fig 7 during the loading phase and near the source both the lack of detectable δ13c tce enrichment and the high tce concentration levels prevent d rayleigh and d sample to depart from 0 fig 7 black and cyan lines respectively however the large d system and d aquitard values of 15 and 70 respectively fig 7a red and blue dashed lines respectively point to tce mass decrease in both the aquitard and the aquifer during the loading phase and away from the source 95 m d rayleigh increases soon after the arrival of the plume but underestimates d sample considerably at year 10 fig 7b d rayleigh even more strongly underestimates d aquitard at year 10 d rayleigh is in the range of d system but those similar values are coincidental as d system depends among others on the thickness of the plume although δ13c tce enrichment is detectable in the aquifer already in the loading phase d rayleigh values may give pessimistic views on the actual high degree of mass destruction in the aquitard d aquitard once the source is removed after 10 years d aquitard quickly increases both near and away from the source as a result of the continuous tce degradation in the aquitard without further admixing of non degraded tce from the source the poorly degraded tce mass in the aquifer is flushed by clean water therefore the mass remaining in the system is mostly contained in the reactive aquitard and d system converges towards d aquitard both d system and d aquitard are large due to the ongoing degradation in the aquitard both d sample and d rayleigh in the aquifer are now influenced only by the back diffusing tce and rapidly increase similarly to d aquitard once the source is removed degradation assessment through csia is improved due to the enriched isotope signature of the back diffusing tce which interestingly provides an insight to the state of degradation in the aquitard quickly after source removal tce mass effectively decreased in the aquifer system and d rayleigh provides a conservative estimate of the state of degradation 3 5 sensitivity analysis of degradation assessment the results of a sensitity analysis of key model parameters on cimb and θ values are shown and discussed in detail in the appendix s13 the main outcomes are reported here with respect to cimb the most influential parameters appear to be the aquitard f oc fig s10c and aquitard thickness fig s10e cimb is sensitive to the spatial separation of the depleted daughter products from their more enriched precursors as discussed before especially during the release phase a higher aquitard f oc therefore yields a larger cimb enrichment noteworthy also without sorption the cimb is predicted to enrich in later stages of the release phase probably this is caused by the loss of depleted daughter products which have diffused through the aquitard and reached the lower aquifer with respect to aquitard thickness a thinner aquitard results probably in an increased mass loss of depleted daughter products to the underlying aquifer while the more enriched precursors sorb stronger and are still present in thinner aquitards during the back diffusion phase causing a strong cimb enrichment preferential mass loss of depleted daughter products to the underlying aquifer is thus another phenomenon contributing to high cimb enrichments that could be observed in overlying aquifers the cimb of samples taken near aquitards is in most cases not a reliable indicator of the occurrence of alternative degradation pathways besides reductive dechlorination like oxidation the sensitivity analysis further shows that rayleigh based estimates of degradation are always conservative moreover we show that both δ13c tce enrichment prior to source remediation and a sudden change in δ13c values once the source is remediated are to be expected under many different field conditions the rayleigh equation systematically underestimates the extent of tce degradation in aquifer samples especially during the loading phase and for conditions leading to long remediation time frames low groundwater flow velocity strong sorption in the aquitard thicker aquitards 3 6 model limitations the simulations required simplifications which influence the results the key assumptions concern mostly reaction i e the simulation of linear sorption and of first order and uniform degradation kinetics in the aquitard diffusion related assumptions are also discussed their implications on the main results are described in this section as presented in the method section the model simulates linear sorption of chlorinated ethenes in aquitards sorption is site specific and while ces sorption was near linear in natural clayey tills lu et al 2011 tce sorption was best represented with freundlich isotherms in several clay rich aquitards in a prior study allen king et al 1996 freundlich or langmuir sorption behavior implies that high ce concentrations compared to the sorption site concentration would overwhelm the sorption capacity of the aquitard the δ13c patterns of the ces would therefore tend towards the patterns observed in the absence of sorption as in fig 9c and 10c a non linear sorption behavior would mainly limit the cimb enrichment induced by the different sorption potentials of the ces first order kinetics were assumed for simplifying the transport model the high source concentration calls for monod kinetics in which case degradation at the high ce concentration levels would comparatively be slower than in our simulation in our simulations slower degradation rates lead to better rayleigh based degradation assessment and to lesser increase of the cimb during the release phase therefore our simulations provide a higher range of the overall impact of the aquitard on the csia data our assumption of biodegradation occurring throughout the aquitard either uniform or non uniform as linear decreasing rate constants yielded different csia patterns in the aquifer than under the assumption of a thin bioactive zone at the top of the aquitard except for the jump in isotope ratios after source release note that resulting csia patterns could be similar in case of abiotic rd ces can degrade abiotically in contact with ferrous minerals in aquitards made of clayey soils or rock matrix schaefer 2016 schaefer et al 2017 while several parameters such as the magnetite susceptibility or the contact surface might influence degradation rates schaefer 2016 schaefer et al 2017 those parameters are not necessarily related to the aquitard depth and degradation rate constants might be more uniform across such an aquitard clearly more research is needed to the depth distribution of bioactivity and chemical reactivity in aquitards both for interpretation of csia data and for assessing remediation time frames the aquifer could also be sufficiently oxic to oxidize the daughter products diffusing out of the aquitard the detection of enrichment of δ13c tce in the absence of daughter compounds could be confused for tce oxidation in the aquifer provided chlorine isotope enrichment factors for tce cometabolism are available the study of combined carbon and chlorine csia data could prevent this uncertainty abe et al 2009 wiegert et al 2012 for instance as the slopes of dce carbon and chlorine csia data differ for biotic and abiotic reductive degradation combined carbon and chlorine csia was employed to determine dce degradation pathways at a field site audí miró et al 2015 the study of carbon and chlorine isotope ratios is therefore promising for pathway distinction in this case finally the ε diffusion values of dce vc and ethene were estimated based on the literature the variations of ε diffusion had little impact on both the cimb and θ provided they are in the selected range an improved estimate of ε diffusion values will not change the implications of the simulations additionally a lower τ app value as suggested by wanner and coworkers for the aquitard would reduce the distance travelled in the aquitard by the ces within the simulation time and reduce the diffusion induced isotope effect 4 summary and implications scenario simulations performed with a reactive transport model illustrate the potential of csia data to detect and quantify naturally occurring reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes ces in an aquifer aquitard aquifer system the model input parameters were based on an extensive literature review during presence of a tce dnapl source tce sequential reductive dechlorination to ethene in the underlying reactive aquitard enhances tce diffusion from the aquifer to the aquitard a resulting δ13c tce enrichment of a few permil δ13c 2 is detectable in the aquifer near the aquitard while in the absence of degradation δ13c tce enrichment induced by tce diffusion to the aquitard is negligible this signifies that before source removal large δ13c tce enrichment is unlikely to be attributable to degradation only in the aquitard but would correspond to degradation at the aquifer level after source removal the diffusion of all ces out of the aquitard is accompanied by a quick and steady increase of the δ13c of all ces and ethene with time and a decreasing δ13c of all ces with distance from the source these characteristic csia patterns during the loading and releases phases contrast strongly to those associated with reductive dechlorination occurring in the aquifer only these characteristic aquitard degradation patterns remain visible when degradation co occurs in the aquifer and could serve as a line of evidence for degradation in the aquitard the sudden jump in isotope ratios in the aquifer after source removal was recognizable in most of the simulations during the sensitivity analysis suggesting that practitioners could use this line of evidence at many sites for effective dnapl source removal wanner et al 2018b our simulated csia patterns differ from those found in the modelling study of wanner et al 2018b where it was assumed that major tce degradation only occurred in centimeters to decimeters thick bioactive zones at the top of aquitards under those conditions δ13c tce did not further increase over time after the initial jump that occurred after source removal and δ13c tce also slightly increased instead of decreased downgradient these aquifer csia patterns are characteristic for aquitards where bioactivity drops to zero already at shallow depth in a more recent study it was shown that bioactivity can spread deeper into an aquitard and rate constants decrease near linearly below a certain depth wanner et al 2018b we demonstrate that also in the case of non uniform degradation similar csia patterns are expected as in the case of uniform degradation provided that the aquitard remains sufficiently bioactive or reactive in the case of abiotic degradation until ces spreading depths csia patterns during the release phase are thus also informative over aquitard reactivity with depth note that our predicted characteristic spatiotemporal csia patterns assuming relatively steady reactivity with depth could also be representative for abiotic chemical reductive dechlorination in aquitards where chemical reactivity as content of reactive minerals is likely to be relatively uniformly distributed the carbon isotope mass balance cimb is influenced by the spatial separation of the ces and ethene during transport during the release phase the cimb increases in the upper aquifer as a result of the relatively limited back diffusion of depleted daughter products while this is the case also when degradation occurs only in the aquifer the cimb increase is stronger when degradation occurs only in the aquitard the cimb increase also occurs but to a lesser extent when vc is the end product of degradation as such it only occurs for a short period when dce stalls the cimb increase is strongest for thinner sorbing aquitards unfortunately for degradation monitoring such increase could be confused with the degradation of the ces through other pathways overestimating the daughter products degradation is problematic as daughter products in the aquitard can act as a new contaminant source during the loading phase application of the rayleigh equation to δ13c tce data sampled in the aquifer strongly underestimates tce degradation in the aquitard provided the aquifer is unreactive within only a few years after source removal the precision of rayleigh based degradation quantification is improved to reasonable levels of underestimation factor 1 25 and seems to well represent the extent of mass destruction in the aquitard at this stage unfortunately conditions increasing remediation timeframes such as a higher f oc in the aquitard thicker aquitards or a slower groundwater velocity increase degradation underestimation especially before source remediation sorption and diffusion induced isotope fractionations have limited impact on tce degradation assessment scenario modelling provides insights into the potential of aquifer csia data for monitoring the reactivity of an aquitard the study of a simplified conceptual site could be extended to more complex aquifer geometry for instance multiple reactive clay beds of different thickness and lengths further work including experimental work should address the potential of chlorine and hydrogen isotope fractionation in identifying aquitard degradation and also to distinct between biological and abiotic degradation that might co occur in aquitards wanner et al 2018a further experimental research to both biological and chemical aquitard reactivity with depth is
