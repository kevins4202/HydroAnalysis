22905,efficient and accurate modelling of a self propelled vessel in a large amplitude seaway with cfd based numerical methods is a challenging task and is prohibitively expensive for most designers and engineers viscous cfd methods can accurately model viscous effects but the small numerical time step required to analyze the rotating propeller leads to a large computational cost a method for efficiently and accurately modelling the six degree of freedom force on the propeller is required to feasibly model a self propelled vessel maneuvering in a high amplitude seaway this paper outlines the framework for developing an unsteady body force propeller model for unsteady conditions the purpose of this study is to train a semi empirical algorithm to accurately prescribe the unsteady body force to model the propeller the moeri container ship propeller is analyzed with rans cfd open water data is compared to the rans cfd results of a steady moving reference frame approach unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate are applied to a transient rotating mesh model in open water and behind condition the predictions of the algorithm match well with the cfd results keywords propeller cfd body force model semi empirical algorithm 1 introduction accurate prediction of the motions and performance of a vessel in a high amplitude seaway is challenging numerical methods are commonly used to analyze ship seakeeping propeller performance and ship maneuvering tezdogan et al 2015 carrica et al 2012 certain numerical methods are more applicable than others depending upon the complexities of the problem inviscid methods are applicable for seakeeping performance when viscous effects like slamming green water or viscous separation are negligible similarly blade element models bem are most accurate when the propeller operation is near the design point in high amplitude seaways these methods are less accurate due to slamming green water and off design propeller operation viscous numerical methods like reynolds averaged navier stokes rans cfd detached eddy simulation des or large eddy simulation les are more expensive than inviscid models but have the potential to capture viscous effects accurately rans calculations can be applied to the ship and to the propeller in which the propeller is analyzed in a rotating mesh sub domain the rotating mesh can be connected to the outer mesh via the overset method wang et al 2018 or the sliding mesh method mizzi et al 2017 these methods are computationally expensive since the transient solution must be calculated for both the propeller and the vessel carrica et al 2012 the propeller time scale is smaller than the ship time scale which results in even more costly solutions because the ship must be analyzed with the propeller time scale although large time step algorithms are available if unsteadiness in the propeller region is important then accuracy will require a small time step despite the computational cost rans may not be accurate in heavily separated flows persson et al 2006 breuer et al 2003 les provides the most accurate predictions for heavily separated propeller flows but for an even greater computational expense a common method for analyzing a self propelled vessel is to use rans volume of fluid vof cfd coupled with an actuator disk to model the force of the propeller rans vof is widely used for seakeeping maneuvering and off shore floating structures larsson et al 2014 tezdogan et al 2015 wu et al 2014 lu et al 2014 kendon et al 2010 piro and maki 2013 this can be implemented by assuming a constant force mousaviraad 2010 or by using a bem code to predict propeller performance and apply the body force with an actuator disk broglia et al 2013 winden 2014 these methods especially utilizing a bem are useful in small amplitude waves when the propeller is operating near the design condition and the flow is attached in high amplitude seaways these methods can accurately depict the free surface green water slamming and other viscous effects around the hull but may not model the propeller forces accurately if viscous effects are significant in a high amplitude seaway due to large vessel motions and accelerations it is important to account for separation in the hull wake and on the propeller the accuracy and computational cost of modelling a self propelled vessel in a large amplitude seaway is still practically out of reach due to the very small numerical time step required for the propeller rotation a method for accurately modelling a propeller while reducing computational cost is desirable this can be accomplished by modelling the vessel with the rans vof method and prescribing a body force to account for the propeller this paper describes the framework for modelling the body force propeller model for unsteady conditions the purpose of this study is to train a semi empirical algorithm to accurately and efficiently prescribe the unsteady body force to model the propeller this study builds upon prior work knight and maki 2018 the surge and revolution rate degrees of freedom are examined using the semi empirical algorithm and cfd the moeri container ship kcs propeller simman 2008 is analyzed with rans cfd open water test data is compared to the rans cfd results of the steady moving reference frame mrf approach after the cfd is validated to the test data unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate are applied to the transient rotating mesh model the foundation of the analysis is based on coefficients which are functions of the vessel velocity and acceleration a common way to determine the forces on a vibrating propeller is to use an added mass and damping model martio et al 2017 mao and young 2016 parsons et al 1980 schwanecke 1963 martio et al 2017 have published on the added mass and damping effects for a surging propeller with variable rotation rate by examining rans calculations and different analytical semi empirical and potential flow methods schwanecke 1963 parsons and vorus 1981 hutchison et al 2013 martio et al 2017 demonstrate that the added mass and damping coefficients depend upon the ratio of the oscillation frequency and the blade rotation frequency herein denoted as k c p in traditional added mass and damping models like martio et al s one must determine the added mass and damping coefficients which depend upon k c p hence a set of unsteady simulations or experiments must be conducted that span the operating range of k c p this paper derives a morison type semi empirical algorithm that does not depend upon the k c p which significantly reduces the requisite number of training cases and accurately predicts the thrust and torque of the propeller the semi empirical algorithm is based on analytical relations with coefficients that are trained from a small number of cfd calculations with steady motion harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate the output from the algorithm is evaluated by comparison to rans cfd predictions for a range of cases harmonic surge fourier series of different harmonic surge frequencies harmonic propeller revolution rate and combinations of both unsteady propeller revolution rate and unsteady surge 2 methodology the methodology is described in three parts first the multi degree of freedom framework is described the second part discusses the algorithm for predicting the body force in open water for a simplified two degree of freedom model the third part discusses the open water algorithm with an additional term to predict the body force of the propeller in behind condition the open water and the behind condition algorithms presented herein model the propeller body force as a function of the propeller s surge and rotation degrees of freedom 2 1 framework the ultimate goal is to model the propeller six degree of freedom force as accurately as a viscous numerical method but at a reduced cost the ship maneuvering equation of motion can be described by eqn 1 eqn 1 demonstrates that the sum of the six degree of freedom force on the hull f h appendages f a and propeller f p is equal to the mass matrix multiplied by the accelerations of the vessel the goal is to derive an algorithm which describes the six degree of freedom body force of the propeller as a function of the velocity and acceleration at the propeller plane caused by the incident wave field and current u o and u o the six degree of freedom velocities and accelerations of the vessel x and x and the rudder angle δ as shown by eqn 2 the effects of diffracted and radiated waves can also be included if relevant for certain cases this algorithm must maintain the accuracy of a viscous cfd method with a rotating propeller while reducing the cost of a maneuvering calculation by removing the need for extra mesh discretization around the propeller and by alleviating the small time step size required to model a rotating propeller 1 f h f a f p m x 2 f p f x f y f z m x m y m z f x x u o u o δ the effects of δ can be incorporated into the velocity and acceleration terms so that the six degree of freedom body force of the propeller can be represented as a morison type equation as shown by eqn 3 the six degree of freedom force contributions from x and u o can be grouped into an instantaneous velocity based term and the contributions from x and u o can be grouped into an instantaneous acceleration based term 3 f p f x f y f z m x m y m z x f x f y f z m x m y m z x f x f y f z m x m y m z u o f x f y f z m x m y m z u o f x f y f z m x m y m z v f x f y f z m x m y m z v the body force can be applied as a term in the navier stokes equations to impart a force density upon a volume in the propeller region the forces and moments should be applied such that the integral of the force density over the volume is equal to the propeller force and moment the focus of this paper is on a subset of the framework this study derives the propeller thrust and torque as a function of time for unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate 2 2 body force prediction in open water with unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate the body force model of the unsteady propeller thrust and torque due to unsteadiness in these two degrees of freedom is expressed by eqn 4 and eqn 5 the body force is calculated as a function of steady state open water data and the instantaneous state of the propeller the instantaneous state of the propeller includes the instantaneous surge velocity and acceleration as well as the instantaneous propeller revolution rate and acceleration the reported torque is the torque required to drive the propeller the steady state open water data is used to determine the velocity based thrust and torque as a function of the advance ratio j with a propeller revolution rate n the j is defined in terms of n the propeller diameter d and the freestream velocity u shown in eqn 6 a time shift t s is also applied to account for the time that the force takes to respond and is a correction parameter to account for phase error the time used by the algorithm t a is the current time t plus t s as shown in eqn 7 a different t s is used for both u and n the method of least squares is used to determine second order polynomials which describe the instantaneous steady state thrust coefficient and torque coefficient as a function of j the steady state thrust coefficient k t and torque coefficient k q can be represented in the form of eqn 8 and eqn 9 respectively the instantaneous j is used to determine k t and k q which are used to determine the velocity based body forces for thrust and torque respectively the velocity based term is the first term in eqn 4 and eqn 5 in addition to the velocity term the instantaneous acceleration in both the surge and rotational degrees of freedom is also used to determine the open water thrust t o and torque q o the instantaneous acceleration in surge a is multiplied by the acceleration coefficient in surge due to surge a m and the acceleration coefficient in rotation due to surge a q components to determine the second term for eqn 4 and eqn 5 respectively the instantaneous acceleration in revolution rate ω b is multiplied by the acceleration coefficient in surge due to rotation a m ω and the acceleration coefficient in rotation due to rotation a q ω components to determine the third term of eqn 4 and eqn 5 respectively to note n is the propeller revolution rate with units revolutions per second whereas ω b has units radians per second the parameters n and ω b are related in eqn 10 one harmonic surge case is required to train the algorithm with correct t s for u and a as well as a m and a q shown in eqn 7 eqn 4 and eqn 5 respectively similarly one harmonic rotation rate case is needed to train the algorithm with the correct t s for n and ω b as well as to train a m ω and a q ω therefore one harmonic motion cfd case is required to train each degree of freedom if only one degree of freedom is desired then only one cfd training case is required to train the model best results are reached when the algorithm is trained with a case that has large acceleration compared to the rest of the data set since the unsteady effects are more dominant 4 t o k t ρ n 2 d 4 velocity a a m ω b a m ω acceleration 5 q o k q ρ n 2 d 5

revolution rate the algorithm for the behind condition is similar to that of the open water but with the added complexity of accounting for the interaction of the propeller with the hull the body force is calculated as a function of the open water data the instantaneous state and one training simulation using the behind condition therefore one additional term is applied to the previously derived body force model for open water the taylor wake fraction w is applied to account for the difference between the vessel velocity and the blade plane velocity shown in eqn 11 the taylor wake fraction is used to calculate the advance velocity u a which is used to calculate j a instead of the ship velocity u as shown in eqn 12 the taylor wake fraction can be derived in two ways the first way is by simulating the vessel without oscillation and measuring the average velocity in the propeller plane without the propeller present the second way to calculate the taylor wake fraction is to use it as a calibration coefficient this method requires a single behind condition case to determine the unknown parameter w in this paper a steady behind condition case is used for training and w can be determined by minimizing the difference of the thrust and the torque between the algorithm and the cfd calculating the average propeller plane velocity is less computationally expensive but would not account for effects of the non uniform inflow to the propeller plane due to the wake of the hull by using w as a calibration coefficient the effects of the non uniformity of the inflow to the propeller plane are accounted for the behind condition thrust coefficient k t b is calculated in terms of j a and is defined by eqn 13 likewise the behind condition torque coefficient k q b is also calculated in terms of j a and is defined by eqn 14 the equations for the behind condition thrust t b and torque q b are shown in eqn 15 and eqn 16 respectively eqn 15 and eqn 16 are in the same form as eqn 4 and eqn 5 with the only difference being that the advance velocity is used instead of the ship speed with w known from the training case the instantaneous ship velocity instantaneous propeller revolution rate and instantaneous accelerations are used to determine the thrust and the torque of the propeller in the behind condition 11 w u u a u 12 j a u a n d 13 k t b b 0 b 1 j a b 2

surge and propeller revolution rate fig 1 shows a flowchart which summarizes the requisite steps necessary to train the algorithm the t b and q b can be applied as a body force in the navier stokes equations the algorithm when specified as a body force can be used to reduce the computational cost of analyzing a self propelled vessel with rans cfd implementing the algorithm would remove the small time step requirement for the rotating propeller and also reduce the total mesh count of the analysis in addition to the ability of the algorithm to reduce computational cost it also must accurately predict the body force the accuracy of the algorithm is subsequently validated with rans cfd modelling and the ability for the algorithm to match the cfd predictions 3 cfd setup the algorithm is trained and evaluated with rans cfd results this section describes the cfd setup for the different cfd studies first the open water cfd methodology is described second the behind condition cfd method is described the five bladed nmri kcs propeller is used for this study and has a d of 0 105 m simman 2008 the length of waterline l w l of the nmri hull is 3 0791 m the nmri open water experiments used water at 22 5 o c and a constant n of 32 revolutions per second the service speed of the vessel is a froude number of 0 2 or a model velocity of 1 1 m s the cfd calculations are performed using openfoam version 2 4 x and the k ω sst turbulence model with wall functions is used the mrf calculations are performed using the mrfsimplefoam solver which is the simplefoam solver with mrf functionality the transient rotating mesh calculations are performed using pimpledymfoam which uses an arbitrary mesh interface ami mrfsimplefoam is used to solve the steady state incompressible navier stokes equations and to apply a mrf that simulates a spinning region for the enclosed geometry the enclosed geometry and domain inside the mrf rotate at a specific rate and the exterior zone is stationary the mrf approach can be used to model steady state axisymmetric problems like hydrokinetic turbines or open water propellers knight et al 2018 mizzi et al 2017 the rotating zone is specified as a cylinder and the blades are enclosed inside the mrf the same zone is used for the transient rotating mesh calculations in the pimpledymfoam transient analysis the rotating zone physically rotates whereas in the mrfsimplefoam steady state analysis the mesh is stationary the maximum courant number for the coarse mesh transient cases is 1 0 the maximum courant number for the base mesh transient cases is increased to 5 0 to accelerate convergence but still be able to examine grid dependence gravity is neglected and the flow is assumed to be incompressible the openfoam utility blockmesh is used to create a structured mesh domain the structured mesh is input to snappyhexmesh which is used to create the mesh that is solved in cfd snappyhexmesh is the default openfoam unstructured mesh utility it is a hex dominant mesher that uses the cut cell method the mesher can be used to increase the refinement both in regions as well as near surfaces snappyhexmesh is used to apply refinement levels to geometrical features by dividing each cell into eight smaller cells snappyhexmesh is also used to apply prism layers to the surfaces of the geometry 3 1 open water cfd the open water propeller is modelled with the propeller blades hub nose cone and shaft extending downstream these surfaces are subsequently referred to as the open water geometry the nose cone extends 0 44d upstream of the propeller plane and the shaft diameter is 0 15d the geometry used for the open water cfd is shown in fig 2 snappyhexmesh is used to apply seven refinement levels to the open water geometry surfaces except for the shaft which has five refinement levels three prism layers are applied to all surfaces snappyhexmesh is used to apply a cylindrical refinement zone with four refinement levels with a diameter of 6d extending 5d upstream of the propeller plane and 10d downstream of the propeller plane a second refinement region with the same diameter continues a level of three refinements to 20d downstream snappyhexmesh is also used to apply a rotating zone with five refinement levels with a diameter of 1 1d extending 0 2d upstream of the propeller plane and 0 6d downstream of the propeller plane the domain extends 10d upstream of the propeller plane 20d downstream of the propeller plane and 10d to the sides of the center of the propeller the rotating zone is used as an mrf for the open water validation and is used as a sliding mesh for the transient simulations a similar mesh and domain setup has been used to analyze hydrokinetic turbines knight et al 2018 three mesh sizes are examined a coarse mesh with 0 3 million cells a base mesh with 1 3 million cells and a fine mesh with 7 2 million cells the different mesh sizes are generated by specifying twice as many uniform grid points in each direction in the blockmesh utility for each subsequently finer mesh the base mesh for the open water cfd is shown in fig 3 the cut plane on the top of the figure shows the domain extent with the flow travelling from left to right the right boundary is an outlet with a fixed pressure velocity inlet outlet the left boundary is a velocity inlet with zero gradient pressure the sides of the domain are symmetry planes and the open water geometry are no slip walls the bottom image shows the mesh details near the propeller surface as well as the circular rotating zone the specifics of the methodology for the open water validation and the unsteady open water cfd analyses are subsequently described 3 1 1 open water validation the open water cfd calculations are validated to the nmri kcs experiments simman 2008 the tests use a constant n of 32 revolutions per second so that the rotational frequency of the blades ω b is 201 06 rad s cfd calculations are performed for j values of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 for each j the u as well as turbulent parameters k and ω are defined at the inlet the mrf method is used to validate the cfd setup for these j values on the coarse base and fine meshes 3 1 2 open water with harmonic surge for each j the turbulent parameters k and ω are defined at the inlet and the inlet u is set to zero the propeller physically moves with the domain using a custom openfoam function in which the velocity ramps to a final mean velocity and then oscillates about the mean velocity with a prescribed displacement amplitude and frequency this specification of inlet parameters is used for all the subsequent cfd setups this case and all subsequent cases use a rotating mesh with ami for this study an average j of 0 5 u 1 68 m s is used with a constant n of 32 revolutions per second the oscillation frequencies ω o s c include 1 5 10 50 100 and 200 rad s all six frequencies are examined with the coarse mesh and three frequencies are examined with the base mesh including 1 10 and 100 rad s in the analysis the ratio of ω o s c ω b is used the displacement amplitude ζ is calculated so that the velocity amplitude is 0 5 m s the displacement d velocity u and acceleration a of the body are represented by eqn 17 eqn 18 and eqn 19 respectively these equations are valid once time t has exceeded the ramp time t r a t r of 0 0628 s is used to accelerate from rest in the comparison of the results between the algorithm and the cfd the plotted time domain starts at 0 094 s which is the ramp time plus the time for one propeller revolution this removes the effects of the velocity ramp and the sudden jump in velocity at time equal to t r this starting time is used in the plots for open water with harmonic surge as well as all subsequent cases 17 d x 1 u t 0 5 t r ζ sin ω o s c t t r 18 u x 1 u ζ ω o s c cos ω o s c t t r 19 a x 1 ζ ω o s c 2 sin ω o s c t t r 3 1 3 open water with different j values to confirm that the algorithm provides good results at different j values than those which it is trained with two additional average j values are examined j is decreased to 0 3 and increased to 0 7 which correlates to u values of 1 008 m s and 2 352 m s respectively 3 1 4 open water with fourier series of multiple oscillation frequencies a fourier series is analyzed with the coarse mesh to evaluate if different frequencies of oscillation couple with each other all six frequencies are superimposed upon each other with the maximum possible velocity amplitude of 1 344 m s thus each frequency has a velocity amplitude of 0 224 m s a second fourier series is examined which excludes the highest frequency in this case the maximum possible velocity amplitude is still 1 344 m s thus each frequency has a velocity amplitude of 0 2688 m s a third fourier series is examined which uses a fourier series representation of a square wave of velocity this fourier series tests the algorithm s ability to predict the forces on the propeller when both fast and slow varying velocities are simultaneously present the setup is otherwise the same as the setup for the single frequency oscillation 3 1 5 open water with harmonic propeller revolution rate the propeller physically moves with the domain using a custom openfoam function in which the velocity ramps to a constant forward velocity and a mean propeller revolution rate about which the propeller revolution rate varies with prescribed angular displacement amplitude and frequency for this study an average j of 0 5 u 1 68 m s and a mean n 32 revolutions per second is used the oscillation frequencies ω o s c include 1 5 10 50 100 and 200 rad s all six frequencies are examined with the coarse mesh in the analysis the ratio of ω o s c ω b is used where ω b is the average propeller rotational rate in radians per second the angular displacement amplitude ζ θ is calculated so that the rotational rate amplitude which is the product of ζ θ and ω o s c is 9 927 radians per second the angular position θ rotational rate ω b and rotation rate acceleration ω b of the propeller are represented by eqn 20 eqn 21 and eqn 22 respectively these equations are valid once time t has exceeded the ramp time t r a t r of 0 0628 s is used 20 θ x 4 ω b t 0 5 t r ζ θ sin ω o s c t t r 21 ω b x 4 ω b ζ θ ω o s c cos ω o s c t t r 22 ω b x 4 ζ θ ω o s c 2 sin ω o s c t t r 3 1 6 open water with harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate the propeller physically moves with the domain using both custom openfoam functions for harmonic surge and for harmonic propeller revolution rate the velocity ramps to a final mean velocity and then oscillates about the mean velocity with a prescribed displacement amplitude and frequency the propeller revolution rate ramps to a final ω b and then oscillates about ω b with a prescribed angular displacement amplitude and frequency for this study an average j of 0 5 u 1 68 m s and a mean n 32 revolutions per second is used the oscillation frequencies ω o s c include 50 rad s and 100 rad s this study is used to demonstrate how well algorithm can predict the thrust and torque when both the surge and propeller revolution degrees of freedom are unsteady 3 2 behind condition cfd the behind condition propeller is modelled with the propeller blades hub shaft and hull these are subsequently referred to as the behind condition geometry a double body analysis is performed therefore a symmetry plane is applied at the water plane and the free surface effects are neglected the geometry used for the behind condition cfd is shown in fig 4 zero pitch and baseline displacement are used snappyhexmesh is used to apply seven refinement levels to the behind condition geometry except for the hull which has five refinement levels three prism layers are applied to all surfaces snappyhexmesh is used to apply a cylindrical refinement zone with four refinement levels with a diameter of 3d extending 5d upstream of the propeller plane and 10d downstream of the propeller plane a second refinement zone with the same diameter continues 20d downstream of the propeller plane with 3 levels of refinement snappyhexmesh is also used to apply a rotating zone with five levels of refinement with diameter of 1 1d extending 0 2d upstream of the propeller plane and 0 6d downstream of the propeller plane the domain extends 30d or 1 02 l w l upstream of the bow 90d or 3 06 l w l downstream of the bow 30d or 1 02 l w l to the sides of the center line of the vessel and 30d or 1 02 l w l below the waterline of the vessel the rotating zone is used as a rotating mesh for the transient simulations both a coarse mesh with 0 6 million cells and a base mesh with 2 0 million cells are examined the original blockmesh cell sizes and subsequent blade refinement are the same as the open water cfd cases the increase in total mesh count is due to enlarging the domain and refining the hull the base mesh for the behind condition cfd is shown in fig 5 the cut plane on the top of the figure shows the domain extent with the ship travelling from right to left boundary conditions are specified in a similar way as the open water case the right boundary is an outlet with a fixed pressure velocity inlet outlet the left boundary is a velocity inlet with zero gradient pressure the sides of the domain are symmetry planes and the behind condition geometry are no slip walls the bottom image shows the mesh details near the propeller surface and the hull as well as the rotating circular domain the velocity is prescribed in the same way as the harmonic oscillation open water case both harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate are examined independently and together 3 2 1 behind condition with harmonic surge amplitude four harmonic surge cases are examined the first is a calm water case for which ζ and ω o s c are zero the second case corresponds to an encounter frequency ω e that the vessel would experience in head seas at a froude number of 0 2 with a wavelength λ equal to the l w l the third case corresponds to a ω e that the vessel would experience in following seas at a froude number of 0 2 with λ equal to l w l the froude number of 0 2 corresponds with nmri tests for u of 1 1 m s since this service speed is less than the speed analyzed in the open water configuration the velocity amplitude is scaled by the velocity ratio of the behind condition average velocity and open water average velocity times the open water velocity amplitude the selected velocity amplitude for both excitation frequencies is calculated to be 0 327 m s the ω e can be calculated as a function of the wavenumber k wave frequency ω o λ the gravitational constant g u and the heading angle β as shown in eqn 23 and eqn 24 a fourth case to test the high frequency accuracy is for an ω b of 100 radians per second 23 ω o 2 k g 2 π λ g 24 ω e ω o u k c o s β 3 2 2 behind condition with large harmonic surge amplitude at the head seas frequency the velocity amplitude of the surge motion ζ ω o s c is increased to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm for more significant force fluctuations the velocity amplitude is doubled to 0 66 m s and is further increased to 1 1 m s since the u is 1 1 m s the highest velocity amplitude case shows what occurs if the velocity oscillates about u with an amplitude such that the velocity goes from zero to twice the u 3 2 3 behind condition with harmonic propeller revolution rate the effect of harmonic propeller revolution rate is also studied in the behind condition for the frequencies corresponding to head and following seas a ζ θ is determined for each frequency such that the rotational rate amplitude is 6 5 radians per second therefore ζ θ is 0 96 and 2 92 for the head seas frequency and following seas frequency respectively at the following seas frequency both harmonic propeller revolution rate and harmonic surge are applied to confirm that the algorithm can accurately predict the effects of unsteadiness in both degrees of freedom simultaneously 4 results first the open water cfd validation is presented second the open water cfd results are compared to the algorithm predictions third the behind condition cfd results are compared to the algorithm predictions 4 1 open water cfd validation the thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η are defined by eqn 25 eqn 26 and eqn 27 respectively in terms of t n d u q and density ρ 25 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 26 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 27 η t u 2 π n q the open water cfd predictions are compared to the experimental nmri open water results in fig 6 the blue line and symbols represent the k t the black line and symbols represent 10 k q and the red line and symbols represent η the circles correspond to experimental results the x corresponds to the coarse mesh the corresponds to the base mesh and the squares correspond to the fine mesh good agreement is found between the cfd predictions and the experiments for the prediction of thrust for all meshes for on design conditions but finer meshes are necessary for good agreement for low j values a similar trend exists for the prediction of k q however all cfd predictions under predict the experimental k q values for high j values the open water results presented by nmri simman 2008 state that the torque predictions may contain error due to the small scale of the propeller but do not include error bars for the purposes of this study this validation is acceptable since the goal of this paper is to derive an algorithm for matching cfd results a grid convergence index gci verification study is performed based upon the procedure of celik et al 2008 this procedure has also been used to verify numerical uncertainty for other propeller studies owen et al 2018 the average numerical uncertainty for the fine mesh for k t k q and η is 3 27 1 15 and 0 95 respectively the coefficients of b 0 b 1 b 2 c 0 c 1 and c 2 are determined using the method of least squares table 1 shows the coefficients for the coarse mesh similarly experimentally generated data can be used in this step 4 2 comparison of cfd and algorithm prediction for unsteady motion in open water the algorithm predictions are compared to the cfd results for unsteady motion in open water first harmonic surge motion is examined for a j of 0 5 second harmonic surge is examined at j values of 0 3 and 0 7 to ensure that the algorithm does not depend upon j third a fourier series of multiple oscillation frequencies in surge is examined to determine if there is coupling between different frequencies and to evaluate how well the algorithm captures the effects of slow and fast varying motions fourth the effect of harmonic propeller revolution rate in open water is examined fifth the algorithm is examined for simultaneous harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate 4 2 1 harmonic surge in open water the open water coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively the highest frequency case is used to train the algorithm with acceleration coefficients with an a m of 0 14 kg and an a q of 0 002 kg m a t s of 0 001 s is found to most accurately capture the time shift between the force and the motion note that the highest frequency case is the only necessary case to train the algorithm and the other cases are computed only to demonstrate the versatility of the algorithm formulations based on added mass and damping would require several frequencies to be computed the accuracy of the algorithm s prediction of thrust and torque is evaluated in terms of the l2 norm the l2 norm is evaluated for the second half of the cfd time domain to ensure that the flow has fully developed using these parameters the l2 norm percent error of thrust and torque predictions is within 1 3 percent of the coarse cfd prediction for all cases note that the higher frequency cases have shorter time domains compared to the low frequency cases since the forces have reached a constant periodic oscillation fig 9 shows the thrust and torque as a function of time for the analytical model the coarse cfd and the base cfd for three frequencies this demonstrates that the coarse and base meshes predict similar results the l2 norm percent error between the base cfd predictions and the algorithm using the coefficients given in table 1 is within 1 6 percent for both thrust and torque there is good agreement between the cfd and the predictions of the algorithm the advantage of the algorithm over the traditional added mass and damping approach is that only one transient harmonic case is required to train the algorithm to determine the time shift and the acceleration coefficient once these coefficients are known the algorithm is accurate across a wide range of frequencies as shown above the traditional added mass and damping approach requires different added mass and damping coefficients for each k c p as demonstrated by martio et al 2017 if the traditional added mass and damping method was used and trained with only the highest frequency case there would be error when a different oscillation frequency is used this is demonstrated by fig 10 the left hand image of fig 10 shows the thrust predicted by the traditional added mass and damping approach for the frequency it is trained on the right hand image of fig 10 shows the thrust predicted by the traditional added mass and damping approach if the frequency is reduced by two and the same coefficients are used this illustrates that the traditional added mass and damping approach requires more unsteady training data than the algorithm presented herein 4 2 2 harmonic surge in open water with different j the predictions of the algorithm are also compared to harmonic surge cfd cases with the average j values of 0 3 and 0 7 fig 11 and fig 12 show the thrust and torque as a function of time for the algorithm compared to the cfd for j values of 0 3 and 0 7 respectively good agreement is found comparing the cfd and the algorithm at these j values this demonstrates that the algorithm is able to predict the thrust and torque accurately even at average j values that it was not trained at 4 2 3 fourier series of multiple oscillation frequencies in surge a fourier series of all six frequencies is examined to determine if there is any coupling between different oscillation frequencies the top of fig 13 shows the thrust as a function of time and the bottom of fig 13 shows the torque as a function of time there is good agreement between the algorithm and the cfd prediction if the highest frequency is excluded from the fourier series good agreement is also found between the analytical model and the cfd this is demonstrated in fig 14 the l2 norm percent error between the cfd predictions and the algorithm for both fourier series is within 1 25 percent for both thrust and torque to evaluate how well the algorithm predicts when there is fast and slow varying unsteadiness a fourier series representation of a square wave of velocity is also examined the top of fig 15 shows the velocity as a function of time the middle of fig 15 shows thrust as a function of time and the bottom of fig 15 shows the torque as a function of time there is good agreement between the cfd and the predictions of the algorithm 4 2 4 harmonic propeller revolution rate in open water the open water coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque with harmonic propeller revolution rate are shown fig 16 and fig 17 respectively the highest frequency case is used to train the algorithm with acceleration coefficients with an a m ω of 0 0025 kg m and an a q ω of 3 65 10 5 kg m2 a t s for n and ω b of 0 0068 s most accurately corrects phase error so that the l2 norm error for thrust and torque for the training case is less than 1 percent with the properly trained algorithm using only the highest ω o s c case for training good agreement is found with the other cases using these parameters the l2 norm percent error of thrust and torque predictions is within 1 8 percent of the coarse cfd prediction for all cases for the second half of the cfd time domain 4 2 5 harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate in open water the open water coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque with both harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate at an ω o s c of 50 radians per second and 100 radians per second are shown fig 18 and fig 19 respectively thrust as a function of time is shown on the top and torque as a function of time is shown on the bottom using the parameters determined earlier the l2 norm percent error of thrust and torque predictions is within 1 25 percent of the coarse cfd prediction for both frequencies for the second half of the time domain examined this demonstrates good agreement between the algorithm s prediction and the cfd when multiple degrees of freedom vary simultaneously 4 3 comparison of cfd and algorithm prediction for behind condition unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate are examined in the behind condition first pure harmonic surge motion is examined in the behind condition second the harmonic surge amplitude is increased to evaluate how well the algorithm performs for more extreme motions third pure harmonic propeller revolution rate is examined finally the both harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate are examined simultaneously 4 3 1 harmonic surge in behind condition the calm water case is used to determine w to be 0 21 with the w determined eqn 15 and eqn 16 are used to determine the thrust and torque respectively the behind condition coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque are shown fig 20 and fig 21 respectively the accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on the basis of the percent error of the l2 norm and the max norm during the second flow over since the average speed is 1 1 m s and the lwl is 3 0791 m the time required for two flow overs is about 5 60 s therefore for a total simulation time for two flow overs the second half of the data is analyzed since the flow over the hull is not in steady state after the first flow over the calm water analysis which is the training case to determine w has an l2 norm of less than 0 5 percent for thrust and less than 1 9 percent for torque the max norm percent error of the algorithm compared to the coarse cfd prediction for the prediction of both thrust and torque is less than 4 1 percent for both the head seas and following seas case for time greater than the first flow over the percent error of the l2 norm of thrust is less than 1 5 percent for both the head seas and following seas cases after the first flow over the percent error of the l2 norm of torque is less than 2 8 percent for both the head seas and following seas cases after the first flow over the algorithm using the coefficients in table 1 is also compared to the base cfd calculations in calm water and head seas for time after the first flow over the percent error of the l2 norm between the algorithm and the base cfd in calm water is within 1 7 percent for thrust and torque the percent error of the l2 norm between the algorithm and the base cfd in head seas is within 2 4 percent for thrust and torque therefore the algorithm calibrated with coarse cfd data is able to accurately predict the thrust and torque for both the coarse and base meshes to further evaluate the algorithm the ω o s c is increased to 100 radians per second the thrust and torque as a function of time are shown in fig 22 this figure shows that there is good agreement between the algorithm and the cfd predictions the percent error of the l2 norm between the algorithm and the cfd with an ω o s c of 100 radians per second is within 3 6 percent for thrust and torque 4 3 2 harmonic surge in behind condition with increased amplitude to evaluate how well the algorithm predicts the thrust and torque for more significant motions the amplitude at the head seas frequency is increased fig 23 shows the thrust and torque if the amplitude of motion is doubled fig 24 shows the thrust and torque if the amplitude of motion is increased so that the amplitude of motion is equal to the average velocity thus the velocity ranges between zero and twice the service speed of the vessel in both cases good agreement is seen between the algorithm s prediction and the cfd 4 3 3 harmonic propeller revolution rate in behind condition the behind condition coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque with harmonic propeller revolution rate at an ω o s c at the head seas and following seas encounter frequencies are shown fig 25 and fig 26 respectively thrust as a function of time is shown on the top and torque as a function of time is shown on the bottom the l2 norm percent error of thrust predictions is less than 0 75 percent and the percent error of the torque predictions is within 2 00 percent of the coarse cfd prediction for both frequencies for the second half of the time domain examined this demonstrates good agreement between the algorithm s prediction and the cfd in the behind condition with unsteady propeller revolution rate 4 3 4 harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate in behind condition the behind condition coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque with harmonic propeller revolution rate and harmonic surge at an ω o s c at the following seas encounter frequency is shown fig 27 thrust as a function of time is shown on the top and torque as a function of time is shown on the bottom the l2 norm percent error of the analytical predictions to the coarse cfd prediction for both frequencies for the second half of the time domain examined are within 1 5 percent for thrust and 2 7 percent for torque this demonstrates good agreement between the algorithm s prediction and the cfd in the behind condition with both unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate 5 conclusions an unsteady body force propeller model has been developed for unsteady surge and unsteady propeller revolution rate harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate are applied to the open water propeller and an algorithm is derived which accurately predicts these results the algorithm uses the open water thrust open water torque and one high ω o s c training set to train the algorithm for each unsteady degree of freedom therefore one training case is required to train the algorithm for unsteady surge and one training case is required to train the algorithm for unsteady propeller revolution rate once the algorithm is trained it is able to accurately predict the cfd results for different ω o s c values and for more arbitrary unsteady motions to determine if there is coupling between frequencies different ω o s c values are examined in a fourier series such that ω o s c ω b is between 0 005 and 1 this analysis demonstrates that the algorithm predicts accurately for arbitrary motions the trained open water algorithm is extended to the behind condition by determining w with a single steady behind condition cfd simulation the algorithm is able to accurately predict the propeller thrust and torque in the behind configuration once the flow has developed over the hull the algorithm is valid for both unsteady surge as well as unsteady propeller revolution rate the addition of more calibration coefficients could make this prediction even more accurate but would require the expense of more training data the algorithm can be used as a tool to reduce costs and increase accuracy once the algorithm has been trained for a particular vessel it can be used as a body force input in a rans solution this enables a rans solution with accurate propeller forces to be on the same order of cost as a rans solution that assumes constant thrust the algorithm is designed to be as good as the data it is trained with since low cost tools like bems are accurate on design but less accurate off design these tools could be used to determine the open water thrust and torque for on design j more accurate methods like rans des or les can be used for off design j values depending upon the desired fidelity using higher fidelity models or finer meshes to train the algorithm could lead to a more accurate model when there is separated flow the accuracy of the behind condition cfd training data is critical to properly train the algorithm if error is present in any of the training data that error will propagate to the algorithm acknowledgments this work was

22905,efficient and accurate modelling of a self propelled vessel in a large amplitude seaway with cfd based numerical methods is a challenging task and is prohibitively expensive for most designers and engineers viscous cfd methods can accurately model viscous effects but the small numerical time step required to analyze the rotating propeller leads to a large computational cost a method for efficiently and accurately modelling the six degree of freedom force on the propeller is required to feasibly model a self propelled vessel maneuvering in a high amplitude seaway this paper outlines the framework for developing an unsteady body force propeller model for unsteady conditions the purpose of this study is to train a semi empirical algorithm to accurately prescribe the unsteady body force to model the propeller the moeri container ship propeller is analyzed with rans cfd open water data is compared to the rans cfd results of a steady moving reference frame approach unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate are applied to a transient rotating mesh model in open water and behind condition the predictions of the algorithm match well with the cfd results keywords propeller cfd body force model semi empirical algorithm 1 introduction accurate prediction of the motions and performance of a vessel in a high amplitude seaway is challenging numerical methods are commonly used to analyze ship seakeeping propeller performance and ship maneuvering tezdogan et al 2015 carrica et al 2012 certain numerical methods are more applicable than others depending upon the complexities of the problem inviscid methods are applicable for seakeeping performance when viscous effects like slamming green water or viscous separation are negligible similarly blade element models bem are most accurate when the propeller operation is near the design point in high amplitude seaways these methods are less accurate due to slamming green water and off design propeller operation viscous numerical methods like reynolds averaged navier stokes rans cfd detached eddy simulation des or large eddy simulation les are more expensive than inviscid models but have the potential to capture viscous effects accurately rans calculations can be applied to the ship and to the propeller in which the propeller is analyzed in a rotating mesh sub domain the rotating mesh can be connected to the outer mesh via the overset method wang et al 2018 or the sliding mesh method mizzi et al 2017 these methods are computationally expensive since the transient solution must be calculated for both the propeller and the vessel carrica et al 2012 the propeller time scale is smaller than the ship time scale which results in even more costly solutions because the ship must be analyzed with the propeller time scale although large time step algorithms are available if unsteadiness in the propeller region is important then accuracy will require a small time step despite the computational cost rans may not be accurate in heavily separated flows persson et al 2006 breuer et al 2003 les provides the most accurate predictions for heavily separated propeller flows but for an even greater computational expense a common method for analyzing a self propelled vessel is to use rans volume of fluid vof cfd coupled with an actuator disk to model the force of the propeller rans vof is widely used for seakeeping maneuvering and off shore floating structures larsson et al 2014 tezdogan et al 2015 wu et al 2014 lu et al 2014 kendon et al 2010 piro and maki 2013 this can be implemented by assuming a constant force mousaviraad 2010 or by using a bem code to predict propeller performance and apply the body force with an actuator disk broglia et al 2013 winden 2014 these methods especially utilizing a bem are useful in small amplitude waves when the propeller is operating near the design condition and the flow is attached in high amplitude seaways these methods can accurately depict the free surface green water slamming and other viscous effects around the hull but may not model the propeller forces accurately if viscous effects are significant in a high amplitude seaway due to large vessel motions and accelerations it is important to account for separation in the hull wake and on the propeller the accuracy and computational cost of modelling a self propelled vessel in a large amplitude seaway is still practically out of reach due to the very small numerical time step required for the propeller rotation a method for accurately modelling a propeller while reducing computational cost is desirable this can be accomplished by modelling the vessel with the rans vof method and prescribing a body force to account for the propeller this paper describes the framework for modelling the body force propeller model for unsteady conditions the purpose of this study is to train a semi empirical algorithm to accurately and efficiently prescribe the unsteady body force to model the propeller this study builds upon prior work knight and maki 2018 the surge and revolution rate degrees of freedom are examined using the semi empirical algorithm and cfd the moeri container ship kcs propeller simman 2008 is analyzed with rans cfd open water test data is compared to the rans cfd results of the steady moving reference frame mrf approach after the cfd is validated to the test data unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate are applied to the transient rotating mesh model the foundation of the analysis is based on coefficients which are functions of the vessel velocity and acceleration a common way to determine the forces on a vibrating propeller is to use an added mass and damping model martio et al 2017 mao and young 2016 parsons et al 1980 schwanecke 1963 martio et al 2017 have published on the added mass and damping effects for a surging propeller with variable rotation rate by examining rans calculations and different analytical semi empirical and potential flow methods schwanecke 1963 parsons and vorus 1981 hutchison et al 2013 martio et al 2017 demonstrate that the added mass and damping coefficients depend upon the ratio of the oscillation frequency and the blade rotation frequency herein denoted as k c p in traditional added mass and damping models like martio et al s one must determine the added mass and damping coefficients which depend upon k c p hence a set of unsteady simulations or experiments must be conducted that span the operating range of k c p this paper derives a morison type semi empirical algorithm that does not depend upon the k c p which significantly reduces the requisite number of training cases and accurately predicts the thrust and torque of the propeller the semi empirical algorithm is based on analytical relations with coefficients that are trained from a small number of cfd calculations with steady motion harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate the output from the algorithm is evaluated by comparison to rans cfd predictions for a range of cases harmonic surge fourier series of different harmonic surge frequencies harmonic propeller revolution rate and combinations of both unsteady propeller revolution rate and unsteady surge 2 methodology the methodology is described in three parts first the multi degree of freedom framework is described the second part discusses the algorithm for predicting the body force in open water for a simplified two degree of freedom model the third part discusses the open water algorithm with an additional term to predict the body force of the propeller in behind condition the open water and the behind condition algorithms presented herein model the propeller body force as a function of the propeller s surge and rotation degrees of freedom 2 1 framework the ultimate goal is to model the propeller six degree of freedom force as accurately as a viscous numerical method but at a reduced cost the ship maneuvering equation of motion can be described by eqn 1 eqn 1 demonstrates that the sum of the six degree of freedom force on the hull f h appendages f a and propeller f p is equal to the mass matrix multiplied by the accelerations of the vessel the goal is to derive an algorithm which describes the six degree of freedom body force of the propeller as a function of the velocity and acceleration at the propeller plane caused by the incident wave field and current u o and u o the six degree of freedom velocities and accelerations of the vessel x and x and the rudder angle δ as shown by eqn 2 the effects of diffracted and radiated waves can also be included if relevant for certain cases this algorithm must maintain the accuracy of a viscous cfd method with a rotating propeller while reducing the cost of a maneuvering calculation by removing the need for extra mesh discretization around the propeller and by alleviating the small time step size required to model a rotating propeller 1 f h f a f p m x 2 f p f x f y f z m x m y m z f x x u o u o δ the effects of δ can be incorporated into the velocity and acceleration terms so that the six degree of freedom body force of the propeller can be represented as a morison type equation as shown by eqn 3 the six degree of freedom force contributions from x and u o can be grouped into an instantaneous velocity based term and the contributions from x and u o can be grouped into an instantaneous acceleration based term 3 f p f x f y f z m x m y m z x f x f y f z m x m y m z x f x f y f z m x m y m z u o f x f y f z m x m y m z u o f x f y f z m x m y m z v f x f y f z m x m y m z v the body force can be applied as a term in the navier stokes equations to impart a force density upon a volume in the propeller region the forces and moments should be applied such that the integral of the force density over the volume is equal to the propeller force and moment the focus of this paper is on a subset of the framework this study derives the propeller thrust and torque as a function of time for unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate 2 2 body force prediction in open water with unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate the body force model of the unsteady propeller thrust and torque due to unsteadiness in these two degrees of freedom is expressed by eqn 4 and eqn 5 the body force is calculated as a function of steady state open water data and the instantaneous state of the propeller the instantaneous state of the propeller includes the instantaneous surge velocity and acceleration as well as the instantaneous propeller revolution rate and acceleration the reported torque is the torque required to drive the propeller the steady state open water data is used to determine the velocity based thrust and torque as a function of the advance ratio j with a propeller revolution rate n the j is defined in terms of n the propeller diameter d and the freestream velocity u shown in eqn 6 a time shift t s is also applied to account for the time that the force takes to respond and is a correction parameter to account for phase error the time used by the algorithm t a is the current time t plus t s as shown in eqn 7 a different t s is used for both u and n the method of least squares is used to determine second order polynomials which describe the instantaneous steady state thrust coefficient and torque coefficient as a function of j the steady state thrust coefficient k t and torque coefficient k q can be represented in the form of eqn 8 and eqn 9 respectively the instantaneous j is used to determine k t and k q which are used to determine the velocity based body forces for thrust and torque respectively the velocity based term is the first term in eqn 4 and eqn 5 in addition to the velocity term the instantaneous acceleration in both the surge and rotational degrees of freedom is also used to determine the open water thrust t o and torque q o the instantaneous acceleration in surge a is multiplied by the acceleration coefficient in surge due to surge a m and the acceleration coefficient in rotation due to surge a q components to determine the second term for eqn 4 and eqn 5 respectively the instantaneous acceleration in revolution rate ω b is multiplied by the acceleration coefficient in surge due to rotation a m ω and the acceleration coefficient in rotation due to rotation a q ω components to determine the third term of eqn 4 and eqn 5 respectively to note n is the propeller revolution rate with units revolutions per second whereas ω b has units radians per second the parameters n and ω b are related in eqn 10 one harmonic surge case is required to train the algorithm with correct t s for u and a as well as a m and a q shown in eqn 7 eqn 4 and eqn 5 respectively similarly one harmonic rotation rate case is needed to train the algorithm with the correct t s for n and ω b as well as to train a m ω and a q ω therefore one harmonic motion cfd case is required to train each degree of freedom if only one degree of freedom is desired then only one cfd training case is required to train the model best results are reached when the algorithm is trained with a case that has large acceleration compared to the rest of the data set since the unsteady effects are more dominant 4 t o k t ρ n 2 d 4 velocity a a m ω b a m ω acceleration 5 q o k q ρ n 2 d 5

revolution rate the algorithm for the behind condition is similar to that of the open water but with the added complexity of accounting for the interaction of the propeller with the hull the body force is calculated as a function of the open water data the instantaneous state and one training simulation using the behind condition therefore one additional term is applied to the previously derived body force model for open water the taylor wake fraction w is applied to account for the difference between the vessel velocity and the blade plane velocity shown in eqn 11 the taylor wake fraction is used to calculate the advance velocity u a which is used to calculate j a instead of the ship velocity u as shown in eqn 12 the taylor wake fraction can be derived in two ways the first way is by simulating the vessel without oscillation and measuring the average velocity in the propeller plane without the propeller present the second way to calculate the taylor wake fraction is to use it as a calibration coefficient this method requires a single behind condition case to determine the unknown parameter w in this paper a steady behind condition case is used for training and w can be determined by minimizing the difference of the thrust and the torque between the algorithm and the cfd calculating the average propeller plane velocity is less computationally expensive but would not account for effects of the non uniform inflow to the propeller plane due to the wake of the hull by using w as a calibration coefficient the effects of the non uniformity of the inflow to the propeller plane are accounted for the behind condition thrust coefficient k t b is calculated in terms of j a and is defined by eqn 13 likewise the behind condition torque coefficient k q b is also calculated in terms of j a and is defined by eqn 14 the equations for the behind condition thrust t b and torque q b are shown in eqn 15 and eqn 16 respectively eqn 15 and eqn 16 are in the same form as eqn 4 and eqn 5 with the only difference being that the advance velocity is used instead of the ship speed with w known from the training case the instantaneous ship velocity instantaneous propeller revolution rate and instantaneous accelerations are used to determine the thrust and the torque of the propeller in the behind condition 11 w u u a u 12 j a u a n d 13 k t b b 0 b 1 j a b 2

surge and propeller revolution rate fig 1 shows a flowchart which summarizes the requisite steps necessary to train the algorithm the t b and q b can be applied as a body force in the navier stokes equations the algorithm when specified as a body force can be used to reduce the computational cost of analyzing a self propelled vessel with rans cfd implementing the algorithm would remove the small time step requirement for the rotating propeller and also reduce the total mesh count of the analysis in addition to the ability of the algorithm to reduce computational cost it also must accurately predict the body force the accuracy of the algorithm is subsequently validated with rans cfd modelling and the ability for the algorithm to match the cfd predictions 3 cfd setup the algorithm is trained and evaluated with rans cfd results this section describes the cfd setup for the different cfd studies first the open water cfd methodology is described second the behind condition cfd method is described the five bladed nmri kcs propeller is used for this study and has a d of 0 105 m simman 2008 the length of waterline l w l of the nmri hull is 3 0791 m the nmri open water experiments used water at 22 5 o c and a constant n of 32 revolutions per second the service speed of the vessel is a froude number of 0 2 or a model velocity of 1 1 m s the cfd calculations are performed using openfoam version 2 4 x and the k ω sst turbulence model with wall functions is used the mrf calculations are performed using the mrfsimplefoam solver which is the simplefoam solver with mrf functionality the transient rotating mesh calculations are performed using pimpledymfoam which uses an arbitrary mesh interface ami mrfsimplefoam is used to solve the steady state incompressible navier stokes equations and to apply a mrf that simulates a spinning region for the enclosed geometry the enclosed geometry and domain inside the mrf rotate at a specific rate and the exterior zone is stationary the mrf approach can be used to model steady state axisymmetric problems like hydrokinetic turbines or open water propellers knight et al 2018 mizzi et al 2017 the rotating zone is specified as a cylinder and the blades are enclosed inside the mrf the same zone is used for the transient rotating mesh calculations in the pimpledymfoam transient analysis the rotating zone physically rotates whereas in the mrfsimplefoam steady state analysis the mesh is stationary the maximum courant number for the coarse mesh transient cases is 1 0 the maximum courant number for the base mesh transient cases is increased to 5 0 to accelerate convergence but still be able to examine grid dependence gravity is neglected and the flow is assumed to be incompressible the openfoam utility blockmesh is used to create a structured mesh domain the structured mesh is input to snappyhexmesh which is used to create the mesh that is solved in cfd snappyhexmesh is the default openfoam unstructured mesh utility it is a hex dominant mesher that uses the cut cell method the mesher can be used to increase the refinement both in regions as well as near surfaces snappyhexmesh is used to apply refinement levels to geometrical features by dividing each cell into eight smaller cells snappyhexmesh is also used to apply prism layers to the surfaces of the geometry 3 1 open water cfd the open water propeller is modelled with the propeller blades hub nose cone and shaft extending downstream these surfaces are subsequently referred to as the open water geometry the nose cone extends 0 44d upstream of the propeller plane and the shaft diameter is 0 15d the geometry used for the open water cfd is shown in fig 2 snappyhexmesh is used to apply seven refinement levels to the open water geometry surfaces except for the shaft which has five refinement levels three prism layers are applied to all surfaces snappyhexmesh is used to apply a cylindrical refinement zone with four refinement levels with a diameter of 6d extending 5d upstream of the propeller plane and 10d downstream of the propeller plane a second refinement region with the same diameter continues a level of three refinements to 20d downstream snappyhexmesh is also used to apply a rotating zone with five refinement levels with a diameter of 1 1d extending 0 2d upstream of the propeller plane and 0 6d downstream of the propeller plane the domain extends 10d upstream of the propeller plane 20d downstream of the propeller plane and 10d to the sides of the center of the propeller the rotating zone is used as an mrf for the open water validation and is used as a sliding mesh for the transient simulations a similar mesh and domain setup has been used to analyze hydrokinetic turbines knight et al 2018 three mesh sizes are examined a coarse mesh with 0 3 million cells a base mesh with 1 3 million cells and a fine mesh with 7 2 million cells the different mesh sizes are generated by specifying twice as many uniform grid points in each direction in the blockmesh utility for each subsequently finer mesh the base mesh for the open water cfd is shown in fig 3 the cut plane on the top of the figure shows the domain extent with the flow travelling from left to right the right boundary is an outlet with a fixed pressure velocity inlet outlet the left boundary is a velocity inlet with zero gradient pressure the sides of the domain are symmetry planes and the open water geometry are no slip walls the bottom image shows the mesh details near the propeller surface as well as the circular rotating zone the specifics of the methodology for the open water validation and the unsteady open water cfd analyses are subsequently described 3 1 1 open water validation the open water cfd calculations are validated to the nmri kcs experiments simman 2008 the tests use a constant n of 32 revolutions per second so that the rotational frequency of the blades ω b is 201 06 rad s cfd calculations are performed for j values of 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 for each j the u as well as turbulent parameters k and ω are defined at the inlet the mrf method is used to validate the cfd setup for these j values on the coarse base and fine meshes 3 1 2 open water with harmonic surge for each j the turbulent parameters k and ω are defined at the inlet and the inlet u is set to zero the propeller physically moves with the domain using a custom openfoam function in which the velocity ramps to a final mean velocity and then oscillates about the mean velocity with a prescribed displacement amplitude and frequency this specification of inlet parameters is used for all the subsequent cfd setups this case and all subsequent cases use a rotating mesh with ami for this study an average j of 0 5 u 1 68 m s is used with a constant n of 32 revolutions per second the oscillation frequencies ω o s c include 1 5 10 50 100 and 200 rad s all six frequencies are examined with the coarse mesh and three frequencies are examined with the base mesh including 1 10 and 100 rad s in the analysis the ratio of ω o s c ω b is used the displacement amplitude ζ is calculated so that the velocity amplitude is 0 5 m s the displacement d velocity u and acceleration a of the body are represented by eqn 17 eqn 18 and eqn 19 respectively these equations are valid once time t has exceeded the ramp time t r a t r of 0 0628 s is used to accelerate from rest in the comparison of the results between the algorithm and the cfd the plotted time domain starts at 0 094 s which is the ramp time plus the time for one propeller revolution this removes the effects of the velocity ramp and the sudden jump in velocity at time equal to t r this starting time is used in the plots for open water with harmonic surge as well as all subsequent cases 17 d x 1 u t 0 5 t r ζ sin ω o s c t t r 18 u x 1 u ζ ω o s c cos ω o s c t t r 19 a x 1 ζ ω o s c 2 sin ω o s c t t r 3 1 3 open water with different j values to confirm that the algorithm provides good results at different j values than those which it is trained with two additional average j values are examined j is decreased to 0 3 and increased to 0 7 which correlates to u values of 1 008 m s and 2 352 m s respectively 3 1 4 open water with fourier series of multiple oscillation frequencies a fourier series is analyzed with the coarse mesh to evaluate if different frequencies of oscillation couple with each other all six frequencies are superimposed upon each other with the maximum possible velocity amplitude of 1 344 m s thus each frequency has a velocity amplitude of 0 224 m s a second fourier series is examined which excludes the highest frequency in this case the maximum possible velocity amplitude is still 1 344 m s thus each frequency has a velocity amplitude of 0 2688 m s a third fourier series is examined which uses a fourier series representation of a square wave of velocity this fourier series tests the algorithm s ability to predict the forces on the propeller when both fast and slow varying velocities are simultaneously present the setup is otherwise the same as the setup for the single frequency oscillation 3 1 5 open water with harmonic propeller revolution rate the propeller physically moves with the domain using a custom openfoam function in which the velocity ramps to a constant forward velocity and a mean propeller revolution rate about which the propeller revolution rate varies with prescribed angular displacement amplitude and frequency for this study an average j of 0 5 u 1 68 m s and a mean n 32 revolutions per second is used the oscillation frequencies ω o s c include 1 5 10 50 100 and 200 rad s all six frequencies are examined with the coarse mesh in the analysis the ratio of ω o s c ω b is

revolution rate ramps to a final ω b and then oscillates about ω b with a prescribed angular displacement amplitude and frequency for this study an average j of 0 5 u 1 68 m s and a mean n 32 revolutions per second is used the oscillation frequencies ω o s c include 50 rad s and 100 rad s this study is used to demonstrate how well algorithm can predict the thrust and torque when both the surge and propeller revolution degrees of freedom are unsteady 3 2 behind condition cfd the behind condition propeller is modelled with the propeller blades hub shaft and hull these are subsequently referred to as the behind condition geometry a double body analysis is performed therefore a symmetry plane is applied at the water plane and the free surface effects are neglected the geometry used for the behind condition cfd is shown in fig 4 zero pitch and baseline displacement are used snappyhexmesh is used to apply seven refinement levels to the behind condition geometry except for the hull which has five refinement levels three prism layers are applied to all surfaces snappyhexmesh is used to apply a cylindrical refinement zone with four refinement levels with a diameter of 3d extending 5d upstream of the propeller plane and 10d downstream of the propeller plane a second refinement zone with the same diameter continues 20d downstream of the propeller plane with 3 levels of refinement snappyhexmesh is also used to apply a rotating zone with five levels of refinement with diameter of 1 1d extending 0 2d upstream of the propeller plane and 0 6d downstream of the propeller plane the domain extends 30d or 1 02 l w l upstream of the bow 90d or 3 06 l w l downstream of the bow 30d or 1 02 l w l to the sides of the center line of the vessel and 30d or 1 02 l w l below the waterline of the vessel the rotating zone is used as a rotating mesh for the transient simulations both a coarse mesh with 0 6 million cells and a base mesh with 2 0 million cells are examined the original blockmesh cell sizes and subsequent blade refinement are the same as the open water cfd cases the increase in total mesh count is due to enlarging the domain and refining the hull the base mesh for the behind condition cfd is shown in fig 5 the cut plane on the top of the figure shows the domain extent with the ship travelling from right to left boundary conditions are specified in a similar way as the open water case the right boundary is an outlet with a fixed pressure velocity inlet outlet the left boundary is a velocity inlet with zero gradient pressure the sides of the domain are symmetry planes and the behind condition geometry are no slip walls the bottom image shows the mesh details near the propeller surface and the hull as well as the rotating circular domain the velocity is prescribed in the same way as the harmonic oscillation open water case both harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate are examined independently and together 3 2 1 behind condition with harmonic surge amplitude four harmonic surge cases are examined the first is a calm water case for which ζ and ω o s c are zero the second case corresponds to an encounter frequency ω e that the vessel would experience in head seas at a froude number of 0 2 with a wavelength λ equal to the l w l the third case corresponds to a ω e that the vessel would experience in following seas at a froude number of 0 2 with λ equal to l w l the froude number of 0 2 corresponds with nmri tests for u of 1 1 m s since this service speed is less than the speed analyzed in the open water configuration the velocity amplitude is scaled by the velocity ratio of the behind condition average velocity and open water average velocity times the open water velocity amplitude the selected velocity amplitude for both excitation frequencies is calculated to be 0 327 m s the ω e can be calculated as a function of the wavenumber k wave frequency ω o λ the gravitational constant g u and the heading angle β as shown in eqn 23 and eqn 24 a fourth case to test the high frequency accuracy is for an ω b of 100 radians per second 23 ω o 2 k g 2 π λ g 24 ω e ω o u k c o s β 3 2 2 behind condition with large harmonic surge amplitude at the head seas frequency the velocity amplitude of the surge motion ζ ω o s c is increased to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm for more significant force fluctuations the velocity amplitude is doubled to 0 66 m s and is further increased to 1 1 m s since the u is 1 1 m s the highest velocity amplitude case shows what occurs if the velocity oscillates about u with an amplitude such that the velocity goes from zero to twice the u 3 2 3 behind condition with harmonic propeller revolution rate the effect of harmonic propeller revolution rate is also studied in the behind condition for the frequencies corresponding to head and following seas a ζ θ is determined for each frequency such that the rotational rate amplitude is 6 5 radians per second therefore ζ θ is 0 96 and 2 92 for the head seas frequency and following seas frequency respectively at the following seas frequency both harmonic propeller revolution rate and harmonic surge are applied to confirm that the algorithm can accurately predict the effects of unsteadiness in both degrees of freedom simultaneously 4 results first the open water cfd validation is presented second the open water cfd results are compared to the algorithm predictions third the behind condition cfd results are compared to the algorithm predictions 4 1 open water cfd validation the thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and efficiency η are defined by eqn 25 eqn 26 and eqn 27 respectively in terms of t n d u q and density ρ 25 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 26 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 27 η t u 2 π n q the open water cfd predictions are compared to the experimental nmri open water results in fig 6 the blue line and symbols represent the k t the black line and symbols represent 10 k q and the red line and symbols represent η the circles correspond to experimental results the x corresponds to the coarse mesh the corresponds to the base mesh and the squares correspond to the fine mesh good agreement is found between the cfd predictions and the experiments for the prediction of thrust for all meshes for on design conditions but finer meshes are necessary for good agreement for low j values a similar trend exists for the prediction of k q however all cfd predictions under predict the experimental k q values for high j values the open water results presented by nmri simman 2008 state that the torque predictions may contain error due to the small scale of the propeller but do not include error bars for the purposes of this study this validation is acceptable since the goal of this paper is to derive an algorithm for matching cfd results a grid convergence index gci verification study is performed based upon the procedure of celik et al 2008 this procedure has also been used to verify numerical uncertainty for other propeller studies owen et al 2018 the average numerical uncertainty for the fine mesh for k t k q and η is 3 27 1 15 and 0 95 respectively the coefficients of b 0 b 1 b 2 c 0 c 1 and c 2 are determined using the method of least squares table 1 shows the coefficients for the coarse mesh similarly experimentally generated data can be used in this step 4 2 comparison of cfd and algorithm prediction for unsteady motion in open water the algorithm predictions are compared to the cfd results for unsteady motion in open water first harmonic surge motion is examined for a j of 0 5 second harmonic surge is examined at j values of 0 3 and 0 7 to ensure that the algorithm does not depend upon j third a fourier series of multiple oscillation frequencies in surge is examined to determine if there is coupling between different frequencies and to evaluate how well the algorithm captures the effects of slow and fast varying motions fourth the effect of harmonic propeller revolution rate in open water is examined fifth the algorithm is examined for simultaneous harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate 4 2 1 harmonic surge in open water the open water coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively the highest frequency case is used to train the algorithm with acceleration coefficients with an a m of 0 14 kg and an a q of 0 002 kg m a t s of 0 001 s is found to most accurately capture the time shift between the force and the motion note that the highest frequency case is the only necessary case to train the algorithm and the other cases are computed only to demonstrate the versatility of the algorithm formulations based on added mass and damping would require several frequencies to be computed the accuracy of the algorithm s prediction of thrust and torque is evaluated in terms of the l2 norm the l2 norm is evaluated for the second half of the cfd time domain to ensure that the flow has fully developed using these parameters the l2 norm percent error of thrust and torque predictions is within 1 3 percent of the coarse cfd prediction for all cases note that the higher frequency cases have shorter time domains compared to the low frequency cases since the forces have reached a constant periodic oscillation fig 9 shows the thrust and torque as a function of time for the analytical model the coarse cfd and the base cfd for three frequencies this demonstrates that the coarse and base meshes predict similar results the l2 norm percent error between the base cfd predictions and the algorithm using the coefficients given in table 1 is within 1 6 percent for both thrust and torque there is good agreement between the cfd and the predictions of the algorithm the advantage of the algorithm over the traditional added mass and damping approach is that only one transient harmonic case is required to train the algorithm to determine the time shift and the acceleration coefficient once these coefficients are known the algorithm is accurate across a wide range of frequencies as shown above the traditional added mass and damping approach requires different added mass and damping coefficients for each k c p as demonstrated by martio et al 2017 if the traditional added mass and damping method was used and trained with only the highest frequency case there would be error when a different oscillation frequency is used this is demonstrated by fig 10 the left hand image of fig 10 shows the thrust predicted by the traditional added mass and damping approach for the frequency it is trained on the right hand image of fig 10 shows the thrust predicted by the traditional added mass and damping approach if the frequency is reduced by two and the same coefficients are used this illustrates that the traditional added mass and damping approach requires more unsteady training data than the algorithm presented herein 4 2 2 harmonic surge in open water with different j the predictions of the algorithm are also compared to harmonic surge cfd cases with the average j values of 0 3 and 0 7 fig 11 and fig 12 show the thrust and torque as a function of time for the algorithm compared to the cfd for j values of 0 3 and 0 7 respectively good agreement is found comparing the cfd and the algorithm at these j values this demonstrates that the algorithm is able to predict the thrust and torque accurately even at average j values that it was not trained at 4 2 3 fourier series of multiple oscillation frequencies in surge a fourier series of all six frequencies is examined to determine if there is any coupling between different oscillation frequencies the top of fig 13 shows the thrust as a function of time and the bottom of fig 13 shows the torque as a function of time there is good agreement between the algorithm and the cfd prediction if the highest frequency is excluded from the fourier series good agreement is also found between the analytical model and the cfd this is demonstrated in fig 14 the l2 norm percent error between the cfd predictions and the algorithm for both fourier series is within 1 25 percent for both thrust and torque to evaluate how well the algorithm predicts when there is fast and slow varying unsteadiness a fourier series representation of a square wave of velocity is also examined the top of fig 15 shows the velocity as a function of time the middle of fig 15 shows thrust as a function of time and the bottom of fig 15 shows the torque as a function of time there is good agreement between the cfd and the predictions of the algorithm 4 2 4 harmonic propeller revolution rate in open water the open water coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque with harmonic propeller revolution rate are shown fig 16 and fig 17 respectively the highest frequency case is used to train the algorithm with acceleration coefficients with an a m ω of 0 0025 kg m and an a q ω of 3 65 10 5 kg m2 a t s for n and ω b of 0 0068 s most accurately corrects phase error so that the l2 norm error for thrust and torque for the training case is less than 1 percent with the properly trained algorithm using only the highest ω o s c case for training good agreement is found with the other cases using these parameters the l2 norm percent error of thrust and torque predictions is within 1 8 percent of the coarse cfd prediction for all cases for the second half of the cfd time domain 4 2 5 harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate in open water the open water coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque with both harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate at an ω o s c of 50 radians per second and 100 radians per second are shown fig 18 and fig 19 respectively thrust as a function of time is shown on the top and torque as a function of time is shown on the bottom using the parameters determined earlier the l2 norm percent error of thrust and torque predictions is within 1 25 percent of the coarse cfd prediction for both frequencies for the second half of the time domain examined this demonstrates good agreement between the algorithm s prediction and the cfd when multiple degrees of freedom vary simultaneously 4 3 comparison of cfd and algorithm prediction for behind condition unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate are examined in the behind condition first pure harmonic surge motion is examined in the behind condition second the harmonic surge amplitude is increased to evaluate how well the algorithm performs for more extreme motions third pure harmonic propeller revolution rate is examined finally the both harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate are examined simultaneously 4 3 1 harmonic surge in behind condition the calm water case is used to determine w to be 0 21 with the w determined eqn 15 and eqn 16 are used to determine the thrust and torque respectively the behind condition coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque are shown fig 20 and fig 21 respectively the accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on the basis of the percent error of the l2 norm and the max norm during the second flow over since the average speed is 1 1 m s and the lwl is 3 0791 m the time required for two flow overs is about 5 60 s therefore for a total simulation time for two flow overs the second half of the data is analyzed since the flow over the hull is not in steady state after the first flow over the calm water analysis which is the training case to determine w has an l2 norm of less than 0 5 percent for thrust and less than 1 9 percent for torque the max norm percent error of the algorithm compared to the coarse cfd prediction for the prediction of both thrust and torque is less than 4 1 percent for both the head seas and following seas case for time greater than the first flow over the percent error of the l2 norm of thrust is less than 1 5 percent for both the head seas and following seas cases after the first flow over the percent error of the l2 norm of torque is less than 2 8 percent for both the head seas and following seas cases after the first flow over the algorithm using the coefficients in table 1 is also compared to the base cfd calculations in calm water and head seas for time after the first flow over the percent error of the l2 norm between the algorithm and the base cfd in calm water is within 1 7 percent for thrust and torque the percent error of the l2 norm between the algorithm and the base cfd in head seas is within 2 4 percent for thrust and torque therefore the algorithm calibrated with coarse cfd data is able to accurately predict the thrust and torque for both the coarse and base meshes to further evaluate the algorithm the ω o s c is increased to 100 radians per second the thrust and torque as a function of time are shown in fig 22 this figure shows that there is good agreement between the algorithm and the cfd predictions the percent error of the l2 norm between the algorithm and the cfd with an ω o s c of 100 radians per second is within 3 6 percent for thrust and torque 4 3 2 harmonic surge in behind condition with increased amplitude to evaluate how well the algorithm predicts the thrust and torque for more significant motions the amplitude at the head seas frequency is increased fig 23 shows the thrust and torque if the amplitude of motion is doubled fig 24 shows the thrust and torque if the amplitude of motion is increased so that the amplitude of motion is equal to the average velocity thus the velocity ranges between zero and twice the service speed of the vessel in both cases good agreement is seen between the algorithm s prediction and the cfd 4 3 3 harmonic propeller revolution rate in behind condition the behind condition coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque with harmonic propeller revolution rate at an ω o s c at the head seas and following seas encounter frequencies are shown fig 25 and fig 26 respectively thrust as a function of time is shown on the top and torque as a function of time is shown on the bottom the l2 norm percent error of thrust predictions is less than 0 75 percent and the percent error of the torque predictions is within 2 00 percent of the coarse cfd prediction for both frequencies for the second half of the time domain examined this demonstrates good agreement between the algorithm s prediction and the cfd in the behind condition with unsteady propeller revolution rate 4 3 4 harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate in behind condition the behind condition coarse cfd predictions and analytical predictions for thrust and torque with harmonic propeller revolution rate and harmonic surge at an ω o s c at the following seas encounter frequency is shown fig 27 thrust as a function of time is shown on the top and torque as a function of time is shown on the bottom the l2 norm percent error of the analytical predictions to the coarse cfd prediction for both frequencies for the second half of the time domain examined are within 1 5 percent for thrust and 2 7 percent for torque this demonstrates good agreement between the algorithm s prediction and the cfd in the behind condition with both unsteady surge and propeller revolution rate 5 conclusions an unsteady body force propeller model has been developed for unsteady surge and unsteady propeller revolution rate harmonic surge and harmonic propeller revolution rate are applied to the open water propeller and an algorithm is derived which accurately predicts these results the algorithm uses the open water thrust open water torque and one high ω o s c training set to train the algorithm for each unsteady degree of freedom therefore one training case is required to train the algorithm for unsteady surge and one training case is required to train the algorithm for unsteady propeller revolution rate once the algorithm is trained it is able to accurately predict the cfd results for different ω o s c values and for more arbitrary unsteady motions to determine if there is coupling between frequencies different ω o s c values are examined in a fourier series such that ω o s c ω b is between 0 005 and 1 this analysis demonstrates that the algorithm predicts accurately for arbitrary motions the trained open water algorithm is extended to the behind condition by determining w with a single steady behind condition cfd simulation the algorithm is able to accurately predict the propeller thrust and torque in the behind configuration once the flow has developed over the hull the algorithm is valid for both unsteady surge as well as unsteady propeller revolution rate the addition of more calibration coefficients could make this prediction even more accurate but would require the expense of more training data the algorithm can be used as a tool to reduce costs and increase accuracy once the algorithm has been trained for a particular vessel it can be used as a body force input in a rans solution this enables a rans solution with accurate propeller forces to be on the same order of cost as a rans solution that assumes constant thrust the algorithm is designed to be as good as the data it is trained with since low cost tools like bems are accurate on design but less accurate off design these tools could be used to determine the open water thrust and torque for on design j more accurate methods like rans des or les can be used for off design j values depending upon the desired fidelity using higher fidelity models or finer meshes to train the algorithm could lead to a more accurate model when there is separated flow the accuracy of the behind condition cfd training data is critical to properly train the algorithm if error is present in any of the training data that error will propagate to the algorithm acknowledgments this work was

22906,in adverse situations such as maneuvering and motion in waves severe variations of the propeller inflow may be experienced resulting in an increase of propeller thrust and torque and in the generation of in plane loads this may cause undesired hull vibratory loads stress of the propulsive system and even affect somehow the ship dynamic response thus a reliable prediction of these phenomena during design phases is necessary to comply with the increasingly stringent constraints on safety at sea propulsive efficiency vibration and noise pollution in the present work the capabilities of a propeller solver based on a potential boundary element method routinely used in the optimization process of the propulsive device to analyze the propeller performance under different maneuvering conditions are considered after a first validation against u r a n s simulations considering a simple oblique flow the analysis is broadened to a propeller operating in the wake field of a twin screw ship in different maneuvering conditions for which experimental results from free running tests in model scale are available the b e m solver is compared also to a steady blade element approach in order to achieve an overview of the respective pros and cons in view of their inclusion in c f d simulations keywords off design propeller performance propeller bearing loads boundary element method blade element propeller model ship maneuvering 1 introduction the prediction of the off design performance of propeller is a novel area of investigation in marine hydrodynamics dictated by the more stringent requirement in terms of continuity of operation at sea propulsive efficiency vibratory loads and noise pollution the variation of the inflow to the propeller during maneuvering or motions in waves might considerably alter the functioning of the propeller with respect to the rectilinear motion in calm water in general the amplification of the wake non uniformity with non negligible transverse components causes the increase of thrust and torque the generation of relevant in plane loads related to the higher fluctuating character of the forces developed by the blade during a complete revolution and reduces the cavitation inception speed consequently the rise of the magnitude of the blade loads represent an undesired source of vibratory loads on the propulsive shaft and on its structural supports bearings and in turn on the whole propulsion system leading also to higher levels of radiated noise moreover the in plane loads might affect the dynamic response of the vessel the interest on this topic was stimulated by more stringent requirements since the early design stages in terms of continuity of operation and safety during service and alongside the development of comprehensive simulation tools tasked with simulating the ship as a complex system in realistic operative conditions i e maneuvering motion in waves earlier investigations were promoted in case of surface naval vessels due to their higher operational versatility maneuvering or navigation in heavy seas with respect to commercial ones and were aimed to understand the asymmetric behavior of the propellers surface naval ships are typically multi screw and consequent power demand to the prime movers for example kuiper et al 2002 characterized the inflow to the propellers of a patrol boat at full scale during maneuvering at small angle of rudder by combination of l d v laser doppler velocimetry measurements at full and model scale the study clarified for that type of vessel that the asymmetric overloading of the propellers and engines was to be ascribed to the different distribution of the in plane velocity at propeller plane on the windward and leeward side on the basis of this experimental survey shulten 2005 developed a maneuvering simulation program that described the coupled dynamics of ship and prime mover in particular the model was able to describe at least qualitatively the right behavior of the propeller and prime movers synthesizing the key features of the measured inflow and a simplified blade element model for the evaluation of propeller loads viviani et al 2008 analyzed the power absorption for a series of twin screw naval ships during maneuvers and highlighted that the power overloading of the windward propeller was almost doubled with respect to the leeward propeller and at the tightest rudder angle consisted of about 80 with respect to rectilinear motion in coraddu et al 2013 thrust and torque imbalance were quantified by free running maneuvering experiments for a twin screw model in order to design the prime mover automation system in case of different propulsive configurations in particular the cross connect one two shafts linked to the same engine via the reduction gear to this aim a ship dynamic model similar to the shulten s one shulten 2005 was developed on the basis of the experimental results in order to analyze the different propulsion control strategies on ship and prime mover behavior during maneuvering the growing interest on this topic was later demonstrated by the start of ad hoc investigations promoted by classification societies i e d n v a b s g e r m a n i s h e r l l o y d the study highlighted that failures occurred on the tail bearings of modern ships both single and twin screws could be ascribed to excessive deflections of the shaft caused by the side forces and bending moments developed by the propeller during straight ahead sailing and turning maneuvers vartdal et al 2009 lee et al 2017 similarly the problem of the side force developed by the propeller is critical to the structural life and control capabilities of p o d driven ships amini and steen 2011 2012 tuulio 2016 the first systematic investigation that provided a direct measure of the maneuvering forces developed by the propellers during steady turning maneuver was carried out by the circular motion tests on the fully appended model of the d d g 51 twin screw atsavapranee et al 2010 by installing custom 6 components transducers on both propellers measurements highlighted relevant propeller side forces up to 20 of the thrust and consequently their strong effects on the maneuvering qualities of the vessels the contribution of the propeller side force and the need for its modeling for reliable free running maneuvering predictions by c f d was discussed and stressed in broglia et al 2013 for a poorly directionally stable ship recently the investigation of coraddu et al 2013 was broadened in ortolani et al 2015a b for a large twin screw model with the aim to quantify the propeller radial force during realistic steady and unsteady maneuvers the results emphasized the relevant contribution of the side force and the occurrence of complex propeller wake interactions on the internal side during steady and transient maneuvers unsteady r a n s maneuvering simulations were carried out on the same geometry to achieve a cause and effect description of the inflow to the propeller and the developed loads during steady turning maneuvers dubbioso et al 2017 and the unsteady phases at the initial and pull out phase of the turn muscari et al 2017a the effect of stern appendages configuration and propulsion strategies on bearing loads was also inspected in muscari et al 2017b in particular this work highlighted that the orientation of propeller rotation primarily affects the asymmetric behavior of the propellers namely for inward rotating propeller the windward propeller is overloaded vice versa for outward rotating propeller on these basis the critical loads and conditions of the propulsive device that may limit the operational capabilities of a ship and its continuity of operation at sea should be identified in the early design stages unfortunately predictive tools routinely used in the preliminary design rely on potential based theories and therefore are not able to describe the complex nature of the flow around the hull during off design conditions because massive flow separation recirculation regions and interaction of the free surface with the body and the hull wake are strongly non linear and present a viscous nature computational techniques based on the direct solution of the navier stokes equations have nowadays achieved strong reliability to disparate problems of naval hydrodynamics including propeller hydrodynamics c f d simulations of propeller in pure oblique flow carried out in dubbioso et al 2013 yao 2015 were reliable to highlight the differences of the hydrodynamic characteristics with respect to the design condition at zero incidence angle however pure open water states are idealized conditions that are not representative of critical situations that might be experienced in behind hull conditions on the contrary the direct simulation of a rotating propeller in behind hull condition is computationally prohibitive at least for day by day application in normal design because of the increase of the required computational effort in fact the simulation time step must be reduced by at least one order of magnitude in order to solve the smaller spatial and time scales of the propeller flow with respect to the hull even if some practical approach to speed up the hull propeller interaction have been investigated for the self propulsion condition gaggero et al 2017b its application to a maneuvering scenario is beyond nowadays capabilities on the other hand b e m solvers provide the 3d description of the velocity field induced by the wake and the wall pressure by the imposition of the exact boundary condition on the blade surface in unsteady conditions with limited computational resources these tools are nowadays routinely applied for the analysis and design of propellers in non cavitating and cavitating conditions both in open water and behind hull operation in rectilinear motion once specified the effective wake of the hull bertetta et al 2012 gaggero et al 2017a 2016b a their reliability to analyze propeller flow in off design conditions is questionable when the flow separation phenomena are extended over the blades however these effects can be partially modeled by dedicated flow separation models tuulio 2016 yakolev 2009 or empirical corrections derived by experiments or more accurate c f d simulations in pure oblique flow similarly their critical issues related to their adoption when strong radial varying wake occurs further reduces the reliability of these fast approaches gaggero et al 2014 from this point of view b e m solvers can provide a valuable aid to identify more precisely critical conditions also in unsteady functioning that in the successive stages of the design could be inspected by more accurate simulations in the present work the performance of the propellers of a twin screw model during maneuvering conditions are analyzed at first by a b e m solver the same approach described in dubbioso et al 2017 is pursued namely the nominal wake is first evaluated by unsteady r a n s u r a n s simulations and then it is used as offline input to the propeller solver the simulations consist of rectilinear motion and steady turning maneuvers correspondent to rudder angle δ 15 35 at speed correspondent to froude number f n 0 265 the presented approach is certainly less computationally demanding than the simulation involving the rotating propeller and hence it can be easily included in the early design process for an initial estimation of in plane forces and of their influence on hull manoeuvring performance it neglects moreover for this preliminary propeller performance estimation the role of the effective wake or the actual self propulsion functioning since propeller performance are calculated using the nominal wake as inflow and the measured propeller rate of revolution which prediction would have required an expensive iterative approach gaggero et al 2017b the twin screw configuration however represents a broad examination of non standard cases for testing the capability of the b e m approach the inflow conditions on the leeward internal side being completely different with respect to the windward external side on the external side the inflow is not affected by the wake of the hull being nearly a pure oblique flow whereas on the opposite side interactions with the wake characterize the propeller functioning in this light the use of the nominal wake in place of the effective one would not represent a critical source of uncertainties considering the nominal wake as the inflow to the propeller means neglecting the interaction that the propeller functioning realizes with the hull flow boundary layer and vortexes this interaction which is naturally weak in the case of twin screw configuration can be reasonably neglected in the case of the windward propeller since it experiences almost pure undisturbed oblique flow the leeward propeller differently suffers the influence and then a slight interaction of brackets and skeg which in principle should be considered for its performance characterization since however the focus is on design oriented tools for the characterization of in plane propeller forces also this propeller was computed using the nominal wake as inflow the overall positive comparison of propeller loads with the experimental results available in ortolani et al 2015a confirms the effectiveness of this assumption at least in the preliminary design process before dealing with the problem in behind hull an in depth validation of the b e m solver was carried out by means of unsteady r a n s simulations for the rotating propeller that reproduced the equivalent conditions of the external propeller at the different rudder angles the condition on the external propeller is the most appropriate to understand the sources of inconsistency of the potential solver in fact the external propeller experiences a severe overloading that is related to high local incidence angles of the flow impinging the blades dubbioso et al 2017 and consequently viscous related phenomena flow separation leading edge vortex might be triggered this preliminary analysis concerning with a low frequency unsteady case is complementary to the study carried out in greco et al 2014 for the four bladed insean e779a propeller operating in axialsymmetric steady flow the results of the b e m solver are also compared to a steady blade element approach dubbioso et al 2017 this further analysis aims to provide a preliminary benchmark of the capability of these different modeling approaches to properly model the propeller in viscous solvers obviously blade element solvers are indisputably cheaper than b e m solver despite less accurate from this point of view b e m solver can be used to improve with relatively low effort with respect to u r a n s simulations low order models 2 test case the analysis is carried out for the twin screw model considered in ortolani et al 2015a b dubbioso et al 2017 muscari et al 2017a shown in fig 1 the main geometric characteristics for the hull and propellers are listed in table 1 the model is equipped with bilge keels propeller shafts with brackets a centerline skeg and two all movable rudders the inflow to the propellers nominal wake during the rectilinear and maneuvering

plane is not representative of the propeller rudder interaction effect during turns the nominal wake was computed on a toroidal block that replaced the propellers the mesh of the propeller disk consists in 32768 cells 32 radial 128 azimuthal and 8 axial a refinement block that surrounded the appendages and the propeller disks is added in the domain in order to achieve a fine description of the flow field in the stern region fig 3 shows the topology of the refinement blocks on the left and its matching with the propeller disk on the right additional details regarding the set up of the simulations and the discretization of the physical domain are reported in the cited references for the interested reader the inflow conditions experienced by the internal and the external propeller are synthesized in table 2 in terms of advance coefficient j j u w n d where u w is the averaged longitudinal component of the inflow n is the propeller rate of revolution and d is the propeller diameter and mean incidence angle α derived from the averaged components of the computed inflow see fig 18a and b dubbioso et al 2017 in the table the mean incidence angle in the horizontal subscript h and vertical plane subscript v are also specified before considering the behind hull condition a preliminary validation of the b e m and b e m t propeller solvers is performed with respect to u r a n s simulations in pure oblique flow this case is very similar to the external propeller condition the flow on the windward side being close to a pure oblique flow therefore these preliminary computations were set up considering the averaged inflow characteristics of the s t b d propeller unless otherwise specified the propeller loads are cast in non dimensional form as usual namely propeller forces and moments are divided by the factors ρ n 2 d 4 and ρ n 2 d 5 respectively where ρ is the water density ρ 1000 k g m 3 fig 2 describes the reference systems adopted in the analysis in particular the hub frame is the fixed frame with the x h axis coincident to the propeller shaft pointing towards the bow z h upwards and y h as resultant from the right hand rule the rotating frame shown on the right of the figure for the starboard propeller is a cylindrical one and the positive orientation of θ that identifies the blade position angle is in the same sense of propeller rotation r from the hub to the tip of the blade and the x axis parallel to x h according to this representation in the following the relations between the two reference systems are reported according to the use referenced in the analysis i e the velocities are described in the rotating frame and the loads are reported in the hub frame 1 v θ v c o s θ w s i n θ v r v s i n θ w c o s θ where v and w are

θ where f θ and f r are the tangential and radial force developed by a strip of the blade in the discussion the propeller disk is divided into four sectors the first one being defined by 0 θ 90 where θ 0 identifies the blade at the top position 3 numerical tools propeller solvers the theoretical basis of the propeller models are reviewed on the basis of their level of complexity and computational requirements focusing on the underlying assumptions and hypothesis for the application to off design propeller conditions as discussed in the introductory section the attention to the b e m t solver although remarkably simpler with respect to the boundary element method is paid to verify its reliability to correctly capture the blade loads since its attractive computational efficiency for propeller modeling purposes in c f d simulations 3 1 blade element momentum theory bemt the blade element momentum theory b e m t method synthesizes the blade performance by the contribution provided by its cross sections each one formally treated independent from the others by the 2 d airfoil representation formally the propeller loads are obtained by summation of the contribution provided by each blade section once the polar characteristics i e the coefficients of lift d l and drag d d and the effective inflow velocity magnitude and incidence angle α e f f are known referring to a representative section of the propeller blade fig 2 on the right the inflow and the elemental forces are described in fig 4 according to the 2 d representation the radial component is not considered as described in the figure the nominal incidence α n o m to the section given by the superposition of the blade motion and the nominal wake is modified by the induced velocity field 3 α e f f θ γ α i n d γ t a n 1 u ω r v θ where θ is the geometric pitch of the blade and γ is the nominal inflow angle of the section given by the velocity components in the plane of the section v θ is the tangential velocity given by the combination of the components of the wake in the plane of the propeller eq 1 the self induced angle of attack α i n d accounts for the finite span of the blade and blade to blade interactions and is computed by the prandtl betz relation which is solved iteratively to determine the effective angle of incidence the details of the method are not repeated and the interested reader can refer to phillips et al 2003 dubbioso et al 2017 therefore the loads are given by 4 d l d d c α e f f l d α e f f v e f f 2 where c l d are the lift and drag coefficients defined by 5 c l c l α α c d c d 0 c d 1 α c d 2 α 2 the parameters c l α c d 0 c d 1 and c d 2 are assumed constant for all the section and their values are reported in table 3 once lift and drag forces generated by the foil are determined the elemental contribution to thrust d f x and tangential force d f t can be derived 6 d f x d l c o s γ α i n d d d s i n γ α i n d d f t d l s i n γ α i n d d d c o s γ α i n d it has to be stressed that the b e m t model is inherently quasi steady because the prandtl betz condition implicitly assumes the balance of the load developed by the blade strip and the velocity field induced only by the trailing vortex system however during unsteady flow additional vorticity associated to the temporal variation of circulation is shed past the trailing edge of the foil and also concurs to the self induced field this perturbation acts as a memory effect that delays the establishment of the induced velocity field and therefore loads are affected accordingly amini and steen 2012 as a matter of fact the loads result shifted in the circumferential direction and peaks can be the more smoothed the higher the harmonic content of the inflow as a consequence of the circumferential shift in plane loads can be slightly affected by neglecting this mechanism whereas the effects on thrust and torque are negligible further inspection on these aspects is out of the scope of the present paper it being aimed to analyze standard formulations of propeller solvers for a reliable use in c f d solvers and are postponed to future research 3 2 boundary element method the boundary element method b e m uses the hypotheses of inviscid irrotational and incompressible fluid to derive from the general navier stokes and continuity equations a simplified representation of the flow field under these hypotheses indeed the continuity equation takes the form of the laplace equation for a scalar potential function the perturbation velocity potential ϕ x t 7 2 ϕ x t 0 which derivatives represent the components of the perturbation velocity vector in a way that the total velocity at any point of the flow domain is the sum of the undisturbed velocity u x t and the perturbation velocity ϕ x t 8 u x t u x t ϕ x t by using the green s identities equation 7 turns into an integral formulation which can be solved by applying appropriate kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions for wetted and partially super cavitating problems by following the original formulation of kuo and morino 1974 the perturbation velocity potential everywhere on the surfaces of interest can be calculated by a superposition of sources ϕ x t n and dipoles ϕ x t over the solid s b and the trailing vortical wake surfaces s w bounding the computational domain 9 2 π ϕ x t s b ϕ x t n 1 r ϕ x t n 1 r d s s w δ ϕ x t n 1 r d s where n is the unit normal r is the distance between the point of interest x and the integration point x and δ represents the jump of the potential across the trailing vortical wake surfaces denoting with p r e f the pressure far upstream along the shaft axis and with ρ the density of the fluid the pressure may be derived with the use the bernoulli theorem on the propeller fixed reference system 10 ϕ x t t p ρ u x t 2 2 g z p r e f ρ u x t 2 2 from which derives by integration over the propeller surfaces forces and moments 11 f s b p n d s m s b p n x d s the current implementation brizzolara et al 2008 gaggero et al 2010 2014 gaggero and villa 2017 bertetta et al 2012 makes use of the key blade approach proposed by hsin 1990 to address unsteady calculations i e spatial non uniform inflow inclined shaft or a combination of the two the partial non linear formulation of kinnas and fine 1993 fine 1992 solves the sheet cavitation bubble on both suction and pressure side midchord bubble cavitation is partially accounted as a fictitious sheet cavity by the villat brillouin criteria as proposed by mueller and kinnas 1999 based on the partial non linear approach also supercavitating bubbles can be successfully addressed gaggero and brizzolara 2009 for the more general cavitating problem the numerical solution consists of an inner iterative scheme that solves the nonlinearities connected with the kutta the dynamic and the kinematic boundary conditions on the unknown cavity surfaces until the cavity closure condition fine 1992 has been satisfied an outer iterative cycle is used to integrate over the time through equation in order to obtain a periodic solution after the virtual numerical transient due to the key blade approach finally shear stresses ignored by the potential approximation are included by means of simplified and semi empirical formulations standard frictional lines with corrections to account for thickness and camber in the present activity b e m calculations consists only of unsteady non cavitating simulations the key blade is discretized with 1100 hyperboloidal panels while its portion of the hub is represented by 354 elements the trailing vortical wake is prescribed being wake alignment possible in this implementation of the code only for steady calculations in particular the vortex tube is considered rectilinear instead of being deflected by the cross flow using the average inflow for the definition of the pitch of the blade trailing vortical wake since the effects of the vortex tube deflections on the self induced velocity field are reduced with the increase of propeller loading the wake being more straightened in the close proximity of the propeller the frozen wake model currently used represents a decent compromise for the scope of this kind of analyses a fully aligned wake model possible following the approach detailed by lee and kinnas 2005 would indeed result computationally prohibitive in particular when used together with the key blade in exchange for only a slight increase of accuracy with respect to already reliable results as shown by the preliminary analysis in pure oblique flow of section 6 1 well in agreement with rans calculations an overview of the panel mesh implemented to discretize the propeller and the blade vortex sheet is shown in fig 5 unsteadiness is solved with an equivalent time step of 6 seven propeller revolutions are finally considered to extract from calculations periodic forces fluctuations 3 3 rans solver in the present work the commercial viscous flow solver s t a r c c m v 9 cd adapco 0000 has been used as the reference computational tool for the characterization of the unsteady propeller performance applications of this solver can be largely recognized in literature for the specific problems addressed in this work propeller and hull performance prediction its reliability has been verified for configurations brizzolara et al 2008 gaggero et al 2010 similar to those considered in present case showing the opportunity of its use as a reference in the absence of dedicated model measurements as a complementary of experimental tests and as a tool for the tuning of simplified methodologies complex test cases like those proposed in gaggero et al 2017a for the characterization of the propeller performance under severe flow loading conditions of a twin screw pleasure craft additionally demonstrated the accuracy of the numerical predictions with respect to dedicated measurements campaigns carried both in model scale tani et al 2017 and during sea trials the current implementation is based on the finite volume discretization of the computational domain using an unstructured polyhedral cells arrangement with cell centered collocated variables and a face based implementation to deal with cells of arbitrary shape navier stokes equations are solved in their unsteady formulation under the simplification proposed by reynolds to account for the average turbulent fluctuations in the prediction of shear stresses 12 u 0 u t u u p ρ ν 2 u t r e where u and p stand respectively for the mean velocity and pressure field ρ and ν are the fluid density and viscosity and the t r e represents the turbulent flow component which is modeled here by means of the realizable k ε equations a detailed mesh sensitivity analysis as well as investigations concerning the influence of different turbulence models or time discretizations is beyond the scope of present analyses and has been consequently omitted guidelines and simulation strategies learnt for instance from gaggero et al 2014 and gaggero and villa 2017 have been applied and only a general description is included the adopted polyhedral mesh is shown on the left of fig 6 about 5 2m cells 3 5m of which clustered in the near blade region have been used to discretize the whole computational domain rotation is achieved using sliding meshes coupled with matching interfaces necessary to consistently transfer flow informations between them the first mesh region is an inner spherical computational domain which encloses the propeller and that is used to apply the rotational motion the second conversely is a fixed outer cylindrical domain adopted to properly prescribe the undisturbed flow field with the selected flow angle in order to avoid as much as possible any interactions with the boundaries this outer domain has a length of 5 propeller diameters and a radius of 4 propeller diameters as shown on the right of fig 6 a total of eight prism layers were used to solve the boundary layer resulting in an average non dimensional wall distance on the propeller blades equal to 4 with maximum values of about 40 at the blade tip and trailing edge blended wall functions allowed for the automatic handling of simultaneous low re and high re conditions unsteadiness is solved with an equivalent time step of 2 which is a compromise between the required time accuracy and the need of computationally efficient calculations the resulting maximum courant number during a stabilized propeller revolution after the numerical transient is not higher than 5 in few critical cells across the prism layers i e particularly small due to the unstructured meshing approach while average courant number in the inner rotating domain and across the interfaces is below 0 5 this together with the implicit nature of the solver is sufficient to ensure a sufficient independence of the computed results from the simulation time step this together with the implicit nature of the solver is sufficient to ensure a sufficient independence of the computed results from the simulation time step 4 features of the nominal wake the main characteristics of the nominal wake to the leeward port and windward starboard propellers are briefly reviewed from dubbioso et al 2017 and are shown in figs 7 9 in order to better support the analysis of the propeller loads in particular on the external side the flow is similar to a pure oblique flow for the complete set of maneuvers the wake being deflected towards the port side the longitudinal velocity is almost constant over the propeller disk on the internal side the inflow is more complicated because it is markedly affected by the evolution intensity and position of the wake and the vortical structures detached from hull and in particular the appendages bilge keels and skeg at δ 15 see fig 8 on the right half of the disk the increase of vertical velocity which results in a tangential component over the propeller disk is due to the passage of the skeg vortex at δ 35 see fig 9 the upper part of the propeller disk presents a swirling flow region caused by the combination of skeg and bilge vortex and flow separation past the propeller shaft these wake features are specific for the present test case and quantitatively can be different in case of ships with different geometry and stern appendage characteristics in particular for the leeward side where complex wake interactions occur as discussed in the introduction these features legitimize the use of the nominal wake as it is without any corrections to account for propeller hull interactions as the inflow for b e m and b e m t calculations of propeller forces the almost pure oblique flow of the windward wake does not require any special treatment since the flow from the external side does not interact with the hull on the internal side the only relevant interaction of the propeller with the hull flow is that occurring with the propeller shaft being skeg and bilge vortexes generated far upstream the propeller plane to be sensibly influenced in strength and position by the action of the propeller itself also for this wake then using the nominal wake in place of the effective seems a reasonable assumption 5 propeller in oblique flow simplified physical background in this paragraph the basic concepts and formula that describe the propeller functioning in oblique flow that are useful to support the discussion of the results are introduced consistently with the simulations in pure oblique flow for the isolated propeller a propeller impinged by a flow tilted in the vertical plane with the angle β is considered in the framework of a blade element description a generic section of the blade experiences a variable flow during the revolution due to the periodic variation of v θ given only by the vertical component w see fig 4 the incidence angle α equation 3 and fig 2 on the right panel thus changes periodically being maximum at θ 90 and minimum at θ 270 and assuming the same values when the blade is at the top and bottom position synthesizing the blade hydrodynamics with this representative section it can be deduced from equation 4 that the blade develops a higher load during the motion in the sectors 0 θ 180 down stroke with respect to 0 θ 180 upstroke and consequently a non zero vertical force results see fig 10 in a similar fashion the origin of the side force results by the unbalance of the propeller load in the upper and lower half of disk see fig 10 on the right obviously the unbalances of in plane loads occur with those of thrust and consistently the origin of in plane moments can be easily gathered dubbioso et al 2017 the quasi steady approximation gives the same orientation for the in plane velocity component and force however the system of loads is non zero for all the components also in the case of pure oblique flow in fact the hydrodynamic of the blade is time dependent hence the shedding of variable vorticity past the trailing edge that is convected by the trailing vortex system of the propeller wake introduces a phase shift that modifies the induced velocity field and delays the generation of the sectional load amini and steen 2012 referring to the actual inflow condition the maximum and minimum loads would be delayed past θ 90 and θ 270 the propeller slipstream is tilted by the cross flow this introduces an asymmetry of the effective inflow to the propeller along the vertical plane in the present case equivalent to a horizontal cross flow leishmann 2006 6 results 6 1 pure oblique flow the capabilities of b e m t and b e m solvers to predict propeller performance for the simpler case of pure oblique flow are examined by comparison with unsteady r a n s simulations for the average inflow conditions experienced by the external propeller reported in table 2 in the computations the inclination of the incoming flow is set in the vertical plane x z as introduced in section 5 the comparative study focuses on total propeller loads periodic forces of single blade and their radial distribution furthermore b e m is compared with r a n s in terms of distribution of pressure coefficient c p on the suction and pressure sides of the blades and at representative radial stations of the blade during the period of revolution in order to understand the weackness of the potential based solver to model viscous effects as long as flow separation mechanisms occur the total propeller forces and moments are shown in fig 11 in general the trends of the loads with the increase of the inflow angle obtained with r a n s is captured by both b e m t and b e m methods it has to be noticed that the blade element approach does not provide k t y and k q y because the load distribution is unbalanced between the upper and lower half of the disk only this is due to the lack in describing the phase shift between the angle of attack of the airfoil and its developed load consequent to the time varying circulation the model being inherently quasi steady equation 4 this effect is also evidenced by the evolution of the single blade forces during the period of revolution for the four conditions considered reported in fig 12 in fact it can be observed that the relative maximum value of the blade loads at blade angles occur at multiples of π 4 and by the fact that the radial distributions of f x and f t at θ 0 and 180 coincide the nominal incidence angle of the blade is the same k t x and k q x of b e m are in good agreement with r a n s however in both cases it can be observed that the increase of the incidence angle causes a larger deviation with respect to the reference value and the values to be underestimated especially for the k q x coefficient conversely b e m t overestimates the values of thrust and torque the discrepancies are higher compared with b e m although the torque is better predicted at maximum incidence the discrepancies between the considered methodologies can be better understood by comparison of single blade loads and their radial distribution at representative blade position angles in general b e m captures the circumferential and radial position of the extreme values of the blade load and its radial distribution inspection of single blade developed thrust reported in fig 12 evidences that in case of b e m the discrepancies arise during the sector of the cycle the blade overloads i e 0 θ 180 and amplify with the increase of the inflow angle this feature is clearly evidenced in figs 13 16 by the radial distribution of blade thrust the error is greater at blade position θ 90 and 180 and is maximum in correspondence of the peak on the other hand the radial station of peak value is well captured instead the agreement is noticeably improved at θ 0 and 270 over a large portion of the blade although the results deviate near the hub and tip region the poor matching for 0 θ 180 can be explained with the approximate evaluation of profile drag according to equation 6 for b e m that worsens with the increase of the propeller loading and incidence of the inflow and hence the local angle of attack experienced by the blade sections as demonstrated by the trend of f x and f t along the span of the blade this trend is also confirmed by the distribution of radial force f r the discrepancies with respect to r a n s being evident during the overloading process in the tip region probably associated to non linear phenomena related to the generation and development of the tip vortex flow from a qualitative perspective these aspects are common to all the inflow conditions considered conversely in case of b e m t the mean value of the blade thrust is higher with respect to r a n s and b e m moreover the comparison of the radial distribution with r a n s is worse than b e m along all stations of the blade in particular the maximum value and the radius where it is developed and consequently towards the extremities of the blade one plausible reason of the deficiency of the blade element approach to correctly capture the radial distribution of the loads is the neglect of the skew angle that acts to stagger the inflow to the blade sections the effect of the skew is further discussed below considering its effect on the in plane loads however these errors compensate somehow and the total yaw moment k q z is better captured by b e m t than by b e m as compared to r a n s see fig 11 the underestimation of k q z and k q y by b e m can be ascribed to the underestimation of thrust in the 1 s t and 2 n d quadrants considering the in plane forces it can be observed that k t z predicted by b e m and b e m t are very similar to each other and are lower with respect to r a n s the contribution of f r to the in plane forces see equation 2 is negligible with respect to f t in fact it can be observed from the periodic variation of the loads that f y and f z are approximately zero at θ 90 270 and θ 0 180 respectively a general overview of single blade loads fig 12 emphasizes a key difference between the 2d and 3d based approaches in case of b e m t the relative maxima for the thrust and vertical force are experienced at same blade position i e θ 90 and 270 consistently to the maximum and minimum incidence angle as given by the nominal inflow on the contrary in case of b e m and r a n s these maxima are shifted the reason of the shift for f z and f y has to be ascribed to the skewed geometry of the blade neglected in the present blade element model in fact fig 12 evidences that the phase shift between the k t x and in plane loads is almost repetitive for all cases considered that span a broad range of advance coefficient and inflow angles this aspect is further established by the sequences of the radial distribution of blade loads the maximum value of f x keeps almost constant for 90 θ 180 whereas the tangential force f t achieves the maximum values around θ 90 see figs 13 16 therefore the in plane loads follows the trend of f t and the radial distribution confirms that the discrepancy of the blade loads is higher approximately at θ 90 distributions of f x and f t from θ 90 and θ 180 change in respect of the position of the peak shifted at outer radii as already observed and the drop of the force at sections close to the hub on these basis the phase difference between the blade thrust and the radial components can be explained with a different compensation of the thrust and tangential force developed by the blade sections at inner and outer radii as a consequence of different efficiency lift to drag ratio of blade foils it is worth to mention that in jessup et al 1977 a similar behavior was detected for a skewed propeller mounted on a ship model with a transom stern impinged by an inflow inclined in the vertical plane qualitatively analogous to the one represented in fig 7 specifically it resulted that the peak of the blade thrust was delayed by almost 20 past the one of the vertical force experienced at a position close to the nominal one at θ 90 see fig 12a and f in the reference conversely in case of the insean e779a propeller characterized by blades with zero skew c f d simulations of pure oblique flow revealed that the peaks of blade thrust and the dominant in plane force were experienced at blade positions close to the nominal ones see for example figs 11 and 12 in dubbioso et al 2013 see table 4 b e m overestimates k t y with respect to r a n s for all the inflow angles the increase of the percentage error reported in table 5 can be explained with deviations of the self induced velocity field over the disk as a consequence of the tilt of the slipstream looking at fig 12 in more detail it can be deduced that the error of the side force between b e m and r a n s see table 5 is mainly originated during the downstroke motion of the blade consistently with the previous discussion moreover in case of the b e m the percentage increase of k t y in the 2 n d quadrant with respect to 1 s t one is greater with respect to r a n s and according to the considerations in section 5 the resulting side force is greater in case of see table 6 b e m finally in case of b e m t the error of k t z with respect to r a n s is comparable to the boundary element approach fig 11 from figs 13 16 it can be evidenced that the cyclic variation of the blade vertical force is qualitatively captured however similarly to b e m the imbalance of the loads between the upstroke and downstroke phase is under predicted probably because the counteraction of the blade vertical force during the last semi cycle is stronger 6 1 1 pressure distributions the pressure distribution developed on the propeller blades obtained with b e m is compared to r a n s in order to provide a complementary perspective to the effect of the skew and on the discrepancies during the overloading process of the blade c p on the suction pressure side is shown in figs 17 20 for the various conditions investigated in general with the increase of the inclination of the inflow the left to right asymmetry of the blade loads is amplified moreover focusing on the downstroke motion of the blade it can be observed that c p evolves asynchronously in the radial direction in fact in the 1 s t quadrant the inner stations of the blade are more loaded with respect to the outer ones then approaching θ 90 the load increases also at tip finally during the rotation in 2 n d quadrant the blade becomes more loaded at the tip this behavior is consistent with the variation of radial distribution of f x and f t shown in figs 13 16 and the conclusions on the mismatch on the evolution of blade thrust and in plane components in order to further inspect the nature of the discrepancy of the peaks in the span wise distribution the pressure coefficient c p for blade elements at r r 0 65 0 85 and 0 95 are extracted for the blade position at θ 110 and θ 290 in case of the highest rudder angle see fig 21 on the left and right half respectively these blade positions are representative of the highest and lowest propeller loading consequent to high and low angle of incidence consistently with the analysis presented in greco et al 2014 at the position the blade is low loaded i e the mean advance coefficient is high c p predicted with b e m is in good agreement with respect to that achieved by r a n s conversely the comparison is much worse at θ 110 specifically at the inner section the peak of pressure on the suction side of the foil is underpredicted by b e m and moreover c p for the outer sections is not well captured in particular it can be observed that the suction peak at the leading edge for the section at r r 0 85 drops at two different slopes and it is kept in the case of r a n s for a larger fraction of the chord this behavior is magnified for the station at r r 0 95 due to the development in the r a n s calculation of a peak approximately close to the mid chord this phenomenon is related to the leading edge vortex consequent to flow separation at the leading edge and its effect on c p distributions were documented in greco et al 2014 for an highly loaded propeller operating in typical open water conditions and dubbioso et al 2014 for the same propeller operating in severe oblique flow potential based solvers fails in capturing this effect it being viscous in nature and require a dedicated modeling approach tian and kinnas 2014 fig 22 further stresses the different morphology of the tip vortex identified by the q factor developed by the blades at θ 110 and 290 6 2 behind hull condition the analysis in behind hull condition is carried out with the b e m t and b e m solvers and the results are compared to the available experimental data ortolani et al 2015a b the computed loads were properly reduced from the propeller plane to the position of the tail shaft see ortolani et al 2015a equation 1 the components acting on the propeller plane are also considered to discuss the discrepancies of the two models the periodic single blade loads are further inspected and discussed following the simplified description reviewed in section 5 in this case the forces and moments are presented in terms of ratio with respect to values in the approach phase the bearing loads are shown in figs 23 25 and the values obtained with the models are summarized in tables 7 11 experimental data for the in plane moments are missing in the figures because they were not measured in the tables b e m t results are presented in terms of percentage difference with respect to b e m considering the absolute values values of b e m t and experiments are presented in dubbioso et al 2017 and are not repeated for the sake of conciseness periodic blade loads are compared for δ 0 15 and 35 in figs 26 28 boundary element method results reproduce the trend of the experiments and their relative discrepancy is comparable to b e m t the asymmetric overloading of thrust and torque is correctly captured although the error on the internal propeller is considerably higher than external one especially for what regards thrust coefficient in case of the in plane moments the trend of b e m t and b e m is similar with the exception of k q z for the external propeller in terms of absolute value the differences are very large in case of the yaw moment and of the pitching moment on the internal propeller in particular b e m t provides a pitching moment that is opposite signed with respect to b e m during rectilinear motions although the error reported in table 7 is very large the absolute value is considerably smaller with respect to the other moments this is consequent to the higher thrust predicted by b e m t in the upper half of the disk 0 θ 90 270 θ 360 that reverses the vertical imbalance of the disk see fig 26 the deviation between the two signals has to be ascribed to the fact that the blade skew is not modeled in fact the peaks are smoother in case of b e m and phase shifted when the blade rotates past the shaft brackets θ 40 300 during maneuvers the discrepancy of k q y on the internal shaft can be also related to blade skew that acts to reduce and shift the phase of the load this is particularly evident in correspondence to the blade skeg vortex interaction at θ 45 compare solid lines in fig 27 the peak of k t x being reduced by almost 30 in case of b e m in general the difference of the yaw moment k q z is related to the fact that b e m predicts a lower value of blade thrust during the up stroke phase of the cycle and consequently the right left unbalance of the load distribution over the disk is amplified this aspect in case of the external propeller is the principal cause of the deviations between b e m t and b e m in particular for this component in fact it can be observed that the left right asymmetry is gradually enforced with rudder angle considering the in plane loads it is worth noticing that the effects of the blade skew on the peaks for thrust and in plane loads discussed for the pure oblique computations is confirmed in behind hull by the evolution of single blade loads calculated by b e m during the rectilinear motion b e m correctly evaluates the direction of k t y oriented toward the hull centerline this is in contrast to b e m t for both the values at the tail shaft and at the bearing see figs 23 and 24 in fact in case of b e m t the upper half of the disk is more loaded and consequently the side force developed by the blade outward oriented with respect to the plane of symmetry of the ship overcomes the one generated in the lower half similarly to k q y although the error is large the absolute value are smaller than thrust and the vertical force qualitatively the trend of k t y are similar for the two methods and the magnitude is in acceptable agreement compared to b e m the side force obtained with b e m t is greater on the internal shaft and lower on the external one as it can be reasoned by the top to bottom imbalance considerations of the single blade side force it can be observed from figs 27 and 28 that at δ 15 and 35 the side force on the external propeller is lower than b e m t on the upper half of the disk in particular in the 2 s t quadrant 90 θ 180 by contrast on the internal side this trend is overturned the side force obtained by b e m t being higher in the upper half of the disk in particular in the 4 t h quadrant 270 θ 360 with respect to b e m the vertical force k t z calculated with b e m t is in better accordance with experiments on the external propeller in fact in case of b e m the blade exerts an higher vertical force in absolute value for 180 θ 360 with respect to opposite half as it can be also evidenced by the different peak values and a negative force results this trend is gradually amplified with the increase of the rudder angle on the contrary in case of b e m t the vertical force evolves with a symmetric character during the downstroke and upstroke motion of the blade on the internal propeller b e m predicts an higher k t z with respect to the blade element approach although the peak values are smoothed due to the modeling of skew due to the higher discrepancy of the vertical force between the right left halves of the disk as compared to b e m t for the sake of completeness the in plane loads at the bearing location are visualized in fig 25 in terms of resultant radial force and phase angle ϕ ϕ t a n 1 k t z k t y in case of b e m the radial force differs from b e m t on the external shaft due to the over prediction of the downward vertical force the trend of the loads for the b e m solver can be also inspected in terms of pressure coefficient distribution c p on the blades as discussed in the following section 6 2 1 pressure distribution bem solver pressure distribution on the blades is of key importance to evaluate the onset and extension of the cavitation bubble on the blade provided by b e m in the limit of established cavitation modeling techniques and the propeller hull pressure induced loads these aspects are traditionally evaluated for the ideal condition in straight motion and the possibility to identify critical conditions met by the vessel during its life may enhance its operative performance the pressure distribution generated on the propeller blades are shown in figs 29 32 in particular the propeller in straight ahead motion is compared with the one on the internal shaft for the maneuver at δ 15 and with both propellers for the maneuver at δ 35 on the basis of the results discussed for the bearing loads and the analysis shown in dubbioso et al 2017 muscari et al 2017a at these rudder angles the blade skeg vortex interaction and the most severe propeller overloading are experienced respectively consistently with the trend of the bearing loads c p markedly changes in maneuvering conditions with respect to the rectilinear motion note that the range of values is smaller at δ 0 at δ 0 fig 29 c p on the suction side is stronger during the downstroke phase in particular in the 2 n d quadrant these aspects are consistent with the generation of the up ward vertical force and the inward orientation of the side force at δ 15 see fig 30 the pressure increases when the blade is almost horizontal and subsequently the load reduces at the inward stations of the blade the asymmetry between the upstroke and downstroke motion is markedly amplified with respect to the δ 0 as a consequence of the blade vortex interaction at the largest rudder angle this unbalance drops see fig 31 moreover the suction on the descending blade is of comparable magnitude with respect to the previous case as a consequence of the cross flow velocity the blade in the upper half of the disk is overloaded with respect to the ones passing in bottom half on the contrary on the external side fig 32 the situation is inverted and the blade is overloaded in the bottom half due to the concurrent contribution of cross flow and blade rotation the slight asymmetry with respect to the vertical axis is consistent to the negative yaw moment k q z exerted by the propeller to the tail shaft fig 23 7 conclusions in the present paper the capabilities of a b e m and b e m t propeller solvers to describe the propeller performance in maneuvering condition were investigated the analysis was motivated by the necessity to solve off design aspects related to ship and its propulsion system in the earlier design stages in these cases a normal procedure is to model the action of propeller instead of performing the simulations with discretized propeller in order to avoid the burden of computational resources and the excessive time requirements conflicting with ship design schedule the analysis was carried out with an increasing level of complexity the problem of the open water propeller in pure oblique flow was addressed at first and then the problem of the propeller in behind hull condition during steady turning maneuvers was considered the analysis in pure oblique flow consisted of the comparison of the two approaches with the results provided by unsteady r a n s simulation for the open water propeller this study was carried out considering the averaged inflow conditions met by the external propeller for the twin screw considered in the successive part of the investigation this validation study highlighted that in general b e m and b e m t captures the trend and the magnitude of the loads with a satisfactory accuracy the comparison in terms of cyclic blade loads and their radial distribution highlighted the superiority of b e m with respect to the blade element approach because the geometric features of the blade are accounted for in particular the effect of the skew on the performance of the blade entering the variable inflow was one of the peculiar mechanism not captured by b e m t divergence of the boundary element method in respect of r a n s was detected at highest propeller loading due to formation of leading edge vortex in the outer portion of the blade b e m t was reliable in capturing the averaged behavior of the blade and the trends of the cyclic blade loads and distributions the comparison between b e m and b e m t was further broadened for the behind hull condition for the twin screw ships considered this study allowed to further compare the two approaches in case of highly irregular inflow field experienced by the propeller on the leeward side the flow on the opposite one being similar to an oblique flow in this case the hydrodynamic loads were compared with respect to the experimental ones with the exception of the in plane moments the comparison with the experiments should be considered qualitative for various reasons the c f d maneuvering simulations for the computation of the nominal wake did not account for the roll angle and free surface although roll angle monitored during the experiments at the speed considered in the present computations was small the in plane loads can be very sensitive to the distribution of the in plane velocities of the wake moreover the nominal wake provided as input to the propeller solvers was not corrected for propeller hull interactions because of the substantial difference achieved by the physical modeling of the two approaches it can be expected that compensations and cancellation effects occurred for the prediction of the loads from this perspective c f d simulations with fully coupled propeller model would be more indicative and consistent for detailed validation purposes but it was out of the scope of work and it will pursued in future research with this perspective it can be concluded that b e m and b e m t are reliable in capturing the trend and the order of magnitude of the loads in particular b e m was also capable to capture the non linear trend of the vertical force caused by propeller wake interactions phenomena for the leeward propeller the trend of single blade loads corroborated the results for the pure oblique flow specifically the largest discrepancies originated in correspondence of regions of the wake characterized by stronger velocity gradients on this basis it can be concluded that b e m t and b e m are both attractive solutions for interactive coupling with r a n s solvers b e m guarantees a better prediction of the load distribution over the propeller disk i e body forces and consequently can be more accurate than b e m t in evaluating the mean effect of propeller rudder interaction as long as the distribution of the velocity field in the propeller slipstream plays a determinant role however due to the ease of implementation and computational effort b e m t should be preferred to b e m for dynamic ship simulations in order to achieve the response of the vessel in fact in these simulations the propeller solver has to provide the propeller loads at every time step correspondent to the transient dynamic state of the ship due to the large computational time demanded to evaluate the characteristics parameters of the response of the ship the number of time steps is very large consequently b e m t solver is at least one order faster than b e m and the savings in computational time over the complete simulation is undoubtedly advantageous moreover a further strength of b e m t is that it is less stiff than b e m in the sense that it can be easily tuned with modification of lift drag coefficients evaluated by dedicated experiments or accurate numerical simulations additionally b e m can be a posteriori considered to further focus on propulsion aspects for the worse conditions resulted by the coupled b e m t r a n s dynamic simulations although b e m was less satisfactory with respect to b e m t at higher propeller loading it captured the trend of the loads was almost equivalent to b e m t at mild loading conditions in particular for the internal propeller where complex blade wake interactions were highlighted in this regard the b e m can be extremely useful to analyze the unsteady operation of the propeller that can not be inspected with the same accuracy by simpler models for example the pressure field developed on the propeller blades and its side effects this aspect is extremely useful to gain further knowledge on critical aspects related to propulsion system like vibratiory loads cavitation and noise emission during off design operations 
22906,in adverse situations such as maneuvering and motion in waves severe variations of the propeller inflow may be experienced resulting in an increase of propeller thrust and torque and in the generation of in plane loads this may cause undesired hull vibratory loads stress of the propulsive system and even affect somehow the ship dynamic response thus a reliable prediction of these phenomena during design phases is necessary to comply with the increasingly stringent constraints on safety at sea propulsive efficiency vibration and noise pollution in the present work the capabilities of a propeller solver based on a potential boundary element method routinely used in the optimization process of the propulsive device to analyze the propeller performance under different maneuvering conditions are considered after a first validation against u r a n s simulations considering a simple oblique flow the analysis is broadened to a propeller operating in the wake field of a twin screw ship in different maneuvering conditions for which experimental results from free running tests in model scale are available the b e m solver is compared also to a steady blade element approach in order to achieve an overview of the respective pros and cons in view of their inclusion in c f d simulations keywords off design propeller performance propeller bearing loads boundary element method blade element propeller model ship maneuvering 1 introduction the prediction of the off design performance of propeller is a novel area of investigation in marine hydrodynamics dictated by the more stringent requirement in terms of continuity of operation at sea propulsive efficiency vibratory loads and noise pollution the variation of the inflow to the propeller during maneuvering or motions in waves might considerably alter the functioning of the propeller with respect to the rectilinear motion in calm water in general the amplification of the wake non uniformity with non negligible transverse components causes the increase of thrust and torque the generation of relevant in plane loads related to the higher fluctuating character of the forces developed by the blade during a complete revolution and reduces the cavitation inception speed consequently the rise of the magnitude of the blade loads represent an undesired source of vibratory loads on the propulsive shaft and on its structural supports bearings and in turn on the whole propulsion system leading also to higher levels of radiated noise moreover the in plane loads might affect the dynamic response of the vessel the interest on this topic was stimulated by more stringent requirements since the early design stages in terms of continuity of operation and safety during service and alongside the development of comprehensive simulation tools tasked with simulating the ship as a complex system in realistic operative conditions i e maneuvering motion in waves earlier investigations were promoted in case of surface naval vessels due to their higher operational versatility maneuvering or navigation in heavy seas with respect to commercial ones and were aimed to understand the asymmetric behavior of the propellers surface naval ships are typically multi screw and consequent power demand to the prime movers for example kuiper et al 2002 characterized the inflow to the propellers of a patrol boat at full scale during maneuvering at small angle of rudder by combination of l d v laser doppler velocimetry measurements at full and model scale the study clarified for that type of vessel that the asymmetric overloading of the propellers and engines was to be ascribed to the different distribution of the in plane velocity at propeller plane on the windward and leeward side on the basis of this experimental survey shulten 2005 developed a maneuvering simulation program that described the coupled dynamics of ship and prime mover in particular the model was able to describe at least qualitatively the right behavior of the propeller and prime movers synthesizing the key features of the measured inflow and a simplified blade element model for the evaluation of propeller loads viviani et al 2008 analyzed the power absorption for a series of twin screw naval ships during maneuvers and highlighted that the power overloading of the windward propeller was almost doubled with respect to the leeward propeller and at the tightest rudder angle consisted of about 80 with respect to rectilinear motion in coraddu et al 2013 thrust and torque imbalance were quantified by free running maneuvering experiments for a twin screw model in order to design the prime mover automation system in case of different propulsive configurations in particular the cross connect one two shafts linked to the same engine via the reduction gear to this aim a ship dynamic model similar to the shulten s one shulten 2005 was developed on the basis of the experimental results in order to analyze the different propulsion control strategies on ship and prime mover behavior during maneuvering the growing interest on this topic was later demonstrated by the start of ad hoc investigations promoted by classification societies i e d n v a b s g e r m a n i s h e r l l o y d the study highlighted that failures occurred on the tail bearings of modern ships both single and twin screws could be ascribed to excessive deflections of the shaft caused by the side forces and bending moments developed by the propeller during straight ahead sailing and turning maneuvers vartdal et al 2009 lee et al 2017 similarly the problem of the side force developed by the propeller is critical to the structural life and control capabilities of p o d driven ships amini and steen 2011 2012 tuulio 2016 the first systematic investigation that provided a direct measure of the maneuvering forces developed by the propellers during steady turning maneuver was carried out by the circular motion tests on the fully appended model of the d d g 51 twin screw atsavapranee et al 2010 by installing custom 6 components transducers on both propellers measurements highlighted relevant propeller side forces up to 20 of the thrust and consequently their strong effects on the maneuvering qualities of the vessels the contribution of the propeller side force and the need for its modeling for reliable free running maneuvering predictions by c f d was discussed and stressed in broglia et al 2013 for a poorly directionally stable ship recently the investigation of coraddu et al 2013 was broadened in ortolani et al 2015a b for a large twin screw model with the aim to quantify the propeller radial force during realistic steady and unsteady maneuvers the results emphasized the relevant contribution of the side force and the occurrence of complex propeller wake interactions on the internal side during steady and transient maneuvers unsteady r a n s maneuvering simulations were carried out on the same geometry to achieve a cause and effect description of the inflow to the propeller and the developed loads during steady turning maneuvers dubbioso et al 2017 and the unsteady phases at the initial and pull out phase of the turn muscari et al 2017a the effect of stern appendages configuration and propulsion strategies on bearing loads was also inspected in muscari et al 2017b in particular this work highlighted that the orientation of propeller rotation primarily affects the asymmetric behavior of the propellers namely for inward rotating propeller the windward propeller is overloaded vice versa for outward rotating propeller on these basis the critical loads and conditions of the propulsive device that may limit the operational capabilities of a ship and its continuity of operation at sea should be identified in the early design stages unfortunately predictive tools routinely used in the preliminary design rely on potential based theories and therefore are not able to describe the complex nature of the flow around the hull during off design conditions because massive flow separation recirculation regions and interaction of the free surface with the body and the hull wake are strongly non linear and present a viscous nature computational techniques based on the direct solution of the navier stokes equations have nowadays achieved strong reliability to disparate problems of naval hydrodynamics including propeller hydrodynamics c f d simulations of propeller in pure oblique flow carried out in dubbioso et al 2013 yao 2015 were reliable to highlight the differences of the hydrodynamic characteristics with respect to the design condition at zero incidence angle however pure open water states are idealized conditions that are not representative of critical situations that might be experienced in behind hull conditions on the contrary the direct simulation of a rotating propeller in behind hull condition is computationally prohibitive at least for day by day application in normal design because of the increase of the required computational effort in fact the simulation time step must be reduced by at least one order of magnitude in order to solve the smaller spatial and time scales of the propeller flow with respect to the hull even if some practical approach to speed up the hull propeller interaction have been investigated for the self propulsion condition gaggero et al 2017b its application to a maneuvering scenario is beyond nowadays capabilities on the other hand b e m solvers provide the 3d description of the velocity field induced by the wake and the wall pressure by the imposition of the exact boundary condition on the blade surface in unsteady conditions with limited computational resources these tools are nowadays routinely applied for the analysis and design of propellers in non cavitating and cavitating conditions both in open water and behind hull operation in rectilinear motion once specified the effective wake of the hull bertetta et al 2012 gaggero et al 2017a 2016b a their reliability to analyze propeller flow in off design conditions is questionable when the flow separation phenomena are extended over the blades however these effects can be partially modeled by dedicated flow separation models tuulio 2016 yakolev 2009 or empirical corrections derived by experiments or more accurate c f d simulations in pure oblique flow similarly their critical issues related to their adoption when strong radial varying wake occurs further reduces the reliability of these fast approaches gaggero et al 2014 from this point of view b e m solvers can provide a valuable aid to identify more precisely critical conditions also in unsteady functioning that in the successive stages of the design could be inspected by more accurate simulations in the present work the performance of the propellers of a twin screw model during maneuvering conditions are analyzed at first by a b e m solver the same approach described in dubbioso et al 2017 is pursued namely the nominal wake is first evaluated by unsteady r a n s u r a n s simulations and then it is used as offline input to the propeller solver the simulations consist of rectilinear motion and steady turning maneuvers correspondent to rudder angle δ 15 35 at speed correspondent to froude number f n 0 265 the presented approach is certainly less computationally demanding than the simulation involving the rotating propeller and hence it can be easily included in the early design process for an initial estimation of in plane forces and of their influence on hull manoeuvring performance it neglects moreover for this preliminary propeller performance estimation the role of the effective wake or the actual self propulsion functioning since propeller performance are calculated using the nominal wake as inflow and the measured propeller rate of revolution which prediction would have required an expensive iterative approach gaggero et al 2017b the twin screw configuration however represents a broad examination of non standard cases for testing the capability of the b e m approach the inflow conditions on the leeward internal side being completely different with respect to the windward external side on the external side the inflow is not affected by the wake of the hull being nearly a pure oblique flow whereas on the opposite side interactions with the wake characterize the propeller functioning in this light the use of the nominal wake in place of the effective one would not represent a critical source of uncertainties considering the nominal wake as the inflow to the propeller means neglecting the interaction that the propeller functioning realizes with the hull flow boundary layer and vortexes this interaction which is naturally weak in the case of twin screw configuration can be reasonably neglected in the case of the windward propeller since it experiences almost pure undisturbed oblique flow the leeward propeller differently suffers the influence and then a slight interaction of brackets and skeg which in principle should be considered for its performance characterization since however the focus is on design oriented tools for the characterization of in plane propeller forces also this propeller was computed using the nominal wake as inflow the overall positive comparison of propeller loads with the experimental results available in ortolani et al 2015a confirms the effectiveness of this assumption at least in the preliminary design process before dealing with the problem in behind hull an in depth validation of the b e m solver was carried out by means of unsteady r a n s simulations for the rotating propeller that reproduced the equivalent conditions of the external propeller at the different rudder angles the condition on the external propeller is the most appropriate to understand the sources of inconsistency of the potential solver in fact the external propeller experiences a severe overloading that is related to high local incidence angles of the flow impinging the blades dubbioso et al 2017 and consequently viscous related phenomena flow separation leading edge vortex might be triggered this preliminary analysis concerning with a low frequency unsteady case is complementary to the study carried out in greco et al 2014 for the four bladed insean e779a propeller operating in axialsymmetric steady flow the results of the b e m solver are also compared to a steady blade element approach dubbioso et al 2017 this further analysis aims to provide a preliminary benchmark of the capability of these different modeling approaches to properly model the propeller in viscous solvers obviously blade element solvers are indisputably cheaper than b e m solver despite less accurate from this point of view b e m solver can be used to improve with relatively low effort with respect to u r a n s simulations low order models 2 test case the analysis is carried out for the twin screw model considered in ortolani et al 2015a b dubbioso et al 2017 muscari et al 2017a shown in fig 1 the main geometric characteristics for the hull and propellers are listed in table 1 the model is equipped with bilge keels propeller shafts with brackets a centerline skeg and two all movable rudders the inflow to the propellers nominal wake during the rectilinear and maneuvering motion is provided by the c f d simulations considered in dubbioso et al 2017 the simulations are carried out at the reference speed in the approach phase of the maneuver u r e f u that corresponds to froude number f n 0 265 i e reynolds number r e 1 6 10 7 and consist of the steady turning maneuvers to the port side obtained with three different rudder angles δ 15 25 35 the motion of the model is prescribed in the inertial frame of reference considering a 3 d o f rigid body dynamics description in terms of yaw rate r r u r i f l p p and drift angle β that resulted from the experiments see table 2 the numerical mesh reproduced all the appendages of the model bilge keels propeller shaft and brackets centerline skeg rudders were removed because the blockage and up wash at the propeller plane is not representative of the propeller rudder interaction effect during turns the nominal wake was computed on a toroidal block that replaced the propellers the mesh of the propeller disk consists in 32768 cells 32 radial 128 azimuthal and 8 axial a refinement block that surrounded the appendages and the propeller disks is added in the domain in order to achieve a fine description of the flow field in the stern region fig 3 shows the topology of the refinement blocks on the left and its matching with the propeller disk on the right additional details regarding the set up of the simulations and the discretization of the physical domain are reported in the cited references for the interested reader the inflow conditions experienced by the internal and the external propeller are synthesized in table 2 in terms of advance coefficient j j u w n d where u w is the averaged longitudinal component of the inflow n is the propeller rate of revolution and d is the propeller diameter and mean incidence angle α derived from the averaged components of the computed inflow see fig 18a and b dubbioso et al 2017 in the table the mean incidence angle in the horizontal subscript h and vertical plane subscript v are also specified before considering the behind hull condition a preliminary validation of the b e m and b e m t propeller solvers is performed with respect to u r a n s simulations in pure oblique flow this case is very similar to the external propeller condition the flow on the windward side being close to a pure oblique flow therefore these preliminary computations were set up considering the averaged inflow characteristics of the s t b d propeller unless otherwise specified the propeller loads are cast in non dimensional form as usual namely propeller forces and moments are divided by the factors ρ n 2 d 4 and ρ n 2 d 5 respectively where ρ is the water density ρ 1000 k g m 3 fig 2 describes the reference systems adopted in the analysis in particular the hub frame is the fixed frame with the x h axis coincident to the propeller shaft pointing towards the bow z h upwards and y h as resultant from the right hand rule the rotating frame shown on the right of the figure for the starboard propeller is a cylindrical one and the positive orientation of θ that identifies the blade position angle is in the same sense of propeller rotation r from the hub to the tip of the blade and the x axis parallel to x h according to this representation in the following the relations between the two reference systems are reported according to the use referenced in the analysis i e the velocities are described in the rotating frame and the loads are reported in the hub frame 1 v θ v c o s θ w s i n θ v r v s i n θ w c o s θ where v and w are the components of the inflow velocities in the plane of the propeller v θ and v r are the tangential and the radial components in terms of loads 2 f y f θ c o s θ f r s i n θ f z f θ s i n θ f r c o s θ where f θ and f r are the tangential and radial force developed by a strip of the blade in the discussion the propeller disk is divided into four sectors the first one being defined by 0 θ 90 where θ 0 identifies the blade at the top position 3 numerical tools propeller solvers the theoretical basis of the propeller models are reviewed on the basis of their level of complexity and computational requirements focusing on the underlying assumptions and hypothesis for the application to off design propeller conditions as discussed in the introductory section the attention to the b e m t solver although remarkably simpler with respect to the boundary element method is paid to verify its reliability to correctly capture the blade loads since its attractive computational efficiency for propeller modeling purposes in c f d simulations 3 1 blade element momentum theory bemt the blade element momentum theory b e m t method synthesizes the blade performance by the contribution provided by its cross sections each one formally treated independent from the others by the 2 d airfoil representation formally the propeller loads are obtained by summation of the contribution provided by each blade section once the polar characteristics i e the coefficients of lift d l and drag d d and the effective inflow velocity magnitude and incidence angle α e f f are known referring to a representative section of the propeller blade fig 2 on the right the inflow and the elemental forces are described in fig 4 according to the 2 d representation the radial component is not considered as described in the figure the nominal incidence α n o m to the section given by the superposition of the blade motion and the nominal wake is modified by the induced velocity field 3 α e f f θ γ α i n d γ t a n 1 u ω r v θ where θ is the geometric pitch of the blade and γ is the nominal inflow angle of the section given by the velocity components in the plane of the section v θ is the tangential velocity given by the combination of the components of the wake in the plane of the propeller eq 1 the self induced angle of attack α i n d accounts for the finite span of the blade and blade to blade interactions and is computed by the prandtl betz relation which is solved iteratively to determine the effective angle of incidence the details of the method are not repeated and the interested reader can refer to phillips et al 2003 dubbioso et al 2017 therefore the loads are given by 4 d l d d c α e f f l d α e f f v e f f 2 where c l d are the lift and drag coefficients defined by 5 c l c l α α c d c d 0 c d 1 α c d 2 α 2 the parameters c l α c d 0 c d 1 and c d 2 are assumed constant for all the section and their values are reported in table 3 once lift and drag forces generated by the foil are determined the elemental contribution to thrust d f x and tangential force d f t can be derived 6 d f x d l c o s γ α i n d d d s i n γ α i n d d f t d l s i n γ α i n d d d c o s γ α i n d it has to be stressed that the b e m t model is inherently quasi steady because the prandtl betz condition implicitly assumes the balance of the load developed by the blade strip and the velocity field induced only by the trailing vortex system however during unsteady flow additional vorticity associated to the temporal variation of circulation is shed past the trailing edge of the foil and also concurs to the self induced field this perturbation acts as a memory effect that delays the establishment of the induced velocity field and therefore loads are affected accordingly amini and steen 2012 as a matter of fact the loads result shifted in the circumferential direction and peaks can be the more smoothed the higher the harmonic content of the inflow as a consequence of the circumferential shift in plane loads can be slightly affected by neglecting this mechanism whereas the effects on thrust and torque are negligible further inspection on these aspects is out of the scope of the present paper it being aimed to analyze standard formulations of propeller solvers for a reliable use in c f d solvers and are postponed to future research 3 2 boundary element method the boundary element method b e m uses the hypotheses of inviscid irrotational and incompressible fluid to derive from the general navier stokes and continuity equations a simplified representation of the flow field under these hypotheses indeed the continuity equation takes the form of the laplace equation for a scalar potential function the perturbation velocity potential ϕ x t 7 2 ϕ x t 0 which derivatives represent the components of the perturbation velocity vector in a way that the total velocity at any point of the flow domain is the sum of the undisturbed velocity u x t and the perturbation velocity ϕ x t 8 u x t u x t ϕ x t by using the green s identities equation 7 turns into an integral formulation which can be solved by applying appropriate kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions for wetted and partially super cavitating problems by following the original formulation of kuo and morino 1974 the perturbation velocity potential everywhere on the surfaces of interest can be calculated by a superposition of sources ϕ x t n and dipoles ϕ x t over the solid s b and the trailing vortical wake surfaces s w bounding the computational domain 9 2 π ϕ x t s b ϕ x t n 1 r ϕ x t n 1 r d s s w δ ϕ x t n 1 r d s where n is the unit normal r is the distance between the point of interest x and the integration point x and δ represents the jump of the potential across the trailing vortical wake surfaces denoting with p r e f the pressure far upstream along the shaft axis and with ρ the density of the fluid the pressure may be derived with the use the bernoulli theorem on the propeller fixed reference system 10 ϕ x t t p ρ u x t 2 2 g z p r e f ρ u x t 2 2 from which derives by integration over the propeller surfaces forces and moments 11 f s b p n d s m s b p n x d s the current implementation brizzolara et al 2008 gaggero et al 2010 2014 gaggero and villa 2017 bertetta et al 2012 makes use of the key blade approach proposed by hsin 1990 to address unsteady calculations i e spatial non uniform inflow inclined shaft or a combination of the two the partial non linear formulation of kinnas and fine 1993 fine 1992 solves the sheet cavitation bubble on both suction and pressure side midchord bubble cavitation is partially accounted as a fictitious sheet cavity by the villat brillouin criteria as proposed by mueller and kinnas 1999 based on the partial non linear approach also supercavitating bubbles can be successfully addressed gaggero and brizzolara 2009 for the more general cavitating problem the numerical solution consists of an inner iterative scheme that solves the nonlinearities connected with the kutta the dynamic and the kinematic boundary conditions on the unknown cavity surfaces until the cavity closure condition fine 1992 has been satisfied an outer iterative cycle is used to integrate over the time through equation in order to obtain a periodic solution after the virtual numerical transient due to the key blade approach finally shear stresses ignored by the potential approximation are included by means of simplified and semi empirical formulations standard frictional lines with corrections to account for thickness and camber in the present activity b e m calculations consists only of unsteady non cavitating simulations the key blade is discretized with 1100 hyperboloidal panels while its portion of the hub is represented by 354 elements the trailing vortical wake is prescribed being wake alignment possible in this implementation of the code only for steady calculations in particular the vortex tube is considered rectilinear instead of being deflected by the cross flow using the average inflow for the definition of the pitch of the blade trailing vortical wake since the effects of the vortex tube deflections on the self induced velocity field are reduced with the increase of propeller loading the wake being more straightened in the close proximity of the propeller the frozen wake model currently used represents a decent compromise for the scope of this kind of analyses a fully aligned wake model possible following the approach detailed by lee and kinnas 2005 would indeed result computationally prohibitive in particular when used together with the key blade in exchange for only a slight increase of accuracy with respect to already reliable results as shown by the preliminary analysis in pure oblique flow of section 6 1 well in agreement with rans calculations an overview of the panel mesh implemented to discretize the propeller and the blade vortex sheet is shown in fig 5 unsteadiness is solved with an equivalent time step of 6 seven propeller revolutions are finally considered to extract from calculations periodic forces fluctuations 3 3 rans solver in the present work the commercial viscous flow solver s t a r c c m v 9 cd adapco 0000 has been used as the reference computational tool for the characterization of the unsteady propeller performance applications of this solver can be largely recognized in literature for the specific problems addressed in this work propeller and hull performance prediction its reliability has been verified for configurations brizzolara et al 2008 gaggero et al 2010 similar to those considered in present case showing the opportunity of its use as a reference in the absence of dedicated model measurements as a complementary of experimental tests and as a tool for the tuning of simplified methodologies complex test cases like those proposed in gaggero et al 2017a for the characterization of the propeller performance under severe flow loading conditions of a twin screw pleasure craft additionally demonstrated the accuracy of the numerical predictions with respect to dedicated measurements campaigns carried both in model scale tani et al 2017 and during sea trials the current implementation is based on the finite volume discretization of the computational domain using an unstructured polyhedral cells arrangement with cell centered collocated variables and a face based implementation to deal with cells of arbitrary shape navier stokes equations are solved in their unsteady formulation under the simplification proposed by reynolds to account for the average turbulent fluctuations in the prediction of shear stresses 12 u 0 u t u u p ρ ν 2 u t r e where u and p stand respectively for the mean velocity and pressure field ρ and ν are the fluid density and viscosity and the t r e represents the turbulent flow component which is modeled here by means of the realizable k ε equations a detailed mesh sensitivity analysis as well as investigations concerning the influence of different turbulence models or time discretizations is beyond the scope of present analyses and has been consequently omitted guidelines and simulation strategies learnt for instance from gaggero et al 2014 and gaggero and villa 2017 have been applied and only a general description is included the adopted polyhedral mesh is shown on the left of fig 6 about 5 2m cells 3 5m of which clustered in the near blade region have been used to discretize the whole computational domain rotation is achieved using sliding meshes coupled with matching interfaces necessary to consistently transfer flow informations between them the first mesh region is an inner spherical computational domain which encloses the propeller and that is used to apply the rotational motion the second conversely is a fixed outer cylindrical domain adopted to properly prescribe the undisturbed flow field with the selected flow angle in order to avoid as much as possible any interactions with the boundaries this outer domain has a length of 5 propeller diameters and a radius of 4 propeller diameters as shown on the right of fig 6 a total of eight prism layers were used to solve the boundary layer resulting in an average non dimensional wall distance on the propeller blades equal to 4 with maximum values of about 40 at the blade tip and trailing edge blended wall functions allowed for the automatic handling of simultaneous low re and high re conditions unsteadiness is solved with an equivalent time step of 2 which is a compromise between the required time accuracy and the need of computationally efficient calculations the resulting maximum courant number during a stabilized propeller revolution after the numerical transient is not higher than 5 in few critical cells across the prism layers i e particularly small due to the unstructured meshing approach while average courant number in the inner rotating domain and across the interfaces is below 0 5 this together with the implicit nature of the solver is sufficient to ensure a sufficient independence of the computed results from the simulation time step this together with the implicit nature of the solver is sufficient to ensure a sufficient independence of the computed results from the simulation time step 4 features of the nominal wake the main characteristics of the nominal wake to the leeward port and windward starboard propellers are briefly reviewed from dubbioso et al 2017 and are shown in figs 7 9 in order to better support the analysis of the propeller loads in particular on the external side the flow is similar to a pure oblique flow for the complete set of maneuvers the wake being deflected towards the port side the longitudinal velocity is almost constant over the propeller disk on the internal side the inflow is more complicated because it is markedly affected by the evolution intensity and position of the wake and the vortical structures detached from hull and in particular the appendages bilge keels and skeg at δ 15 see fig 8 on the right half of the disk the increase of vertical velocity which results in a tangential component over the propeller disk is due to the passage of the skeg vortex at δ 35 see fig 9 the upper part of the propeller disk presents a swirling flow region caused by the combination of skeg and bilge vortex and flow separation past the propeller shaft these wake features are specific for the present test case and quantitatively can be different in case of ships with different geometry and stern appendage characteristics in particular for the leeward side where complex wake interactions occur as discussed in the introduction these features legitimize the use of the nominal wake as it is without any corrections to account for propeller hull interactions as the inflow for b e m and b e m t calculations of propeller forces the almost pure oblique flow of the windward wake does not require any special treatment since the flow from the external side does not interact with the hull on the internal side the only relevant interaction of the propeller with the hull flow is that occurring with the propeller shaft being skeg and bilge vortexes generated far upstream the propeller plane to be sensibly influenced in strength and position by the action of the propeller itself also for this wake then using the nominal wake in place of the effective seems a reasonable assumption 5 propeller in oblique flow simplified physical background in this paragraph the basic concepts and formula that describe the propeller functioning in oblique flow that are useful to support the discussion of the results are introduced consistently with the simulations in pure oblique flow for the isolated propeller a propeller impinged by a flow tilted in the vertical plane with the angle β is considered in the framework of a blade element description a generic section of the blade experiences a variable flow during the revolution due to the periodic variation of v θ given only by the vertical component w see fig 4 the incidence angle α equation 3 and fig 2 on the right panel thus changes periodically being maximum at θ 90 and minimum at θ 270 and assuming the same values when the blade is at the top and bottom position synthesizing the blade hydrodynamics with this representative section it can be deduced from equation 4 that the blade develops a higher load during the motion in the sectors 0 θ 180 down stroke with respect to 0 θ 180 upstroke and consequently a non zero vertical force results see fig 10 in a similar fashion the origin of the side force results by the unbalance of the propeller load in the upper and lower half of disk see fig 10 on the right obviously the unbalances of in plane loads occur with those of thrust and consistently the origin of in plane moments can be easily gathered dubbioso et al 2017 the quasi steady approximation gives the same orientation for the in plane velocity component and force however the system of loads is non zero for all the components also in the case of pure oblique flow in fact the hydrodynamic of the blade is time dependent hence the shedding of variable vorticity past the trailing edge that is convected by the trailing vortex system of the propeller wake introduces a phase shift that modifies the induced velocity field and delays the generation of the sectional load amini and steen 2012 referring to the actual inflow condition the maximum and minimum loads would be delayed past θ 90 and θ 270 the propeller slipstream is tilted by the cross flow this introduces an asymmetry of the effective inflow to the propeller along the vertical plane in the present case equivalent to a horizontal cross flow leishmann 2006 6 results 6 1 pure oblique flow the capabilities of b e m t and b e m solvers to predict propeller performance for the simpler case of pure oblique flow are examined by comparison with unsteady r a n s simulations for the average inflow conditions experienced by the external propeller reported in table 2 in the computations the inclination of the incoming flow is set in the vertical plane x z as introduced in section 5 the comparative study focuses on total propeller loads periodic forces of single blade and their radial distribution furthermore b e m is compared with r a n s in terms of distribution of pressure coefficient c p on the suction and pressure sides of the blades and at representative radial stations of the blade during the period of revolution in order to understand the weackness of the potential based solver to model viscous effects as long as flow separation mechanisms occur the total propeller forces and moments are shown in fig 11 in general the trends of the loads with the increase of the inflow angle obtained with r a n s is captured by both b e m t and b e m methods it has to be noticed that the blade element approach does not provide k t y and k q y because the load distribution is unbalanced between the upper and lower half of the disk only this is due to the lack in describing the phase shift between the angle of attack of the airfoil and its developed load consequent to the time varying circulation the model being inherently quasi steady equation 4 this effect is also evidenced by the evolution of the single blade forces during the period of revolution for the four conditions considered reported in fig 12 in fact it can be observed that the relative maximum value of the blade loads at blade angles occur at multiples of π 4 and by the fact that the radial distributions of f x and f t at θ 0 and 180 coincide the nominal incidence angle of the blade is the same k t x and k q x of b e m are in good agreement with r a n s however in both cases it can be observed that the increase of the incidence angle causes a larger deviation with respect to the reference value and the values to be underestimated especially for the k q x coefficient conversely b e m t overestimates the values of thrust and torque the discrepancies are higher compared with b e m although the torque is better predicted at maximum incidence the discrepancies between the considered methodologies can be better understood by comparison of single blade loads and their radial distribution at representative blade position angles in general b e m captures the circumferential and radial position of the extreme values of the blade load and its radial distribution inspection of single blade developed thrust reported in fig 12 evidences that in case of b e m the discrepancies arise during the sector of the cycle the blade overloads i e 0 θ 180 and amplify with the increase of the inflow angle this feature is clearly evidenced in figs 13 16 by the radial distribution of blade thrust the error is greater at blade position θ 90 and 180 and is maximum in correspondence of the peak on the other hand the radial station of peak value is well captured instead the agreement is noticeably improved at θ 0 and 270 over a large portion of the blade although the results deviate near the hub and tip region the poor matching for 0 θ 180 can be explained with the approximate evaluation of profile drag according to equation 6 for b e m that worsens with the increase of the propeller loading and incidence of the inflow and hence the local angle of attack experienced by the blade sections as demonstrated by the trend of f x and f t along the span of the blade this trend is also confirmed by the distribution of radial force f r the discrepancies with respect to r a n s being evident during the overloading process in the tip region probably associated to non linear phenomena related to the generation and development of the tip vortex flow from a qualitative perspective these aspects are common to all the inflow conditions considered conversely in case of b e m t the mean value of the blade thrust is higher with respect to r a n s and b e m moreover the comparison of the radial distribution with r a n s is worse than b e m along all stations of the blade in particular the maximum value and the radius where it is developed and consequently towards the extremities of the blade one plausible reason of the deficiency of the blade element approach to correctly capture the radial distribution of the loads is the neglect of the skew angle that acts to stagger the inflow to the blade sections the effect of the skew is further discussed below considering its effect on the in plane loads however these errors compensate somehow and the total yaw moment k q z is better captured by b e m t than by b e m as compared to r a n s see fig 11 the underestimation of k q z and k q y by b e m can be ascribed to the underestimation of thrust in the 1 s t and 2 n d quadrants considering the in plane forces it can be observed that k t z predicted by b e m and b e m t are very similar to each other and are lower with respect to r a n s the contribution of f r to the in plane forces see equation 2 is negligible with respect to f t in fact it can be observed from the periodic variation of the loads that f y and f z are approximately zero at θ 90 270 and θ 0 180 respectively a general overview of single blade loads fig 12 emphasizes a key difference between the 2d and 3d based approaches in case of b e m t the relative maxima for the thrust and vertical force are experienced at same blade position i e θ 90 and 270 consistently to the maximum and minimum incidence angle as given by the nominal inflow on the contrary in case of b e m and r a n s these maxima are shifted the reason of the shift for f z and f y has to be ascribed to the skewed geometry of the blade neglected in the present blade element model in fact fig 12 evidences that the phase shift between the k t x and in plane loads is almost repetitive for all cases considered that span a broad range of advance coefficient and inflow angles this aspect is further established by the sequences of the radial distribution of blade loads the maximum value of f x keeps almost constant for 90 θ 180 whereas the tangential force f t achieves the maximum values around θ 90 see figs 13 16 therefore the in plane loads follows the trend of f t and the radial distribution confirms that the discrepancy of the blade loads is higher approximately at θ 90 distributions of f x and f t from θ 90 and θ 180 change in respect of the position of the peak shifted at outer radii as already observed and the drop of the force at sections close to the hub on these basis the phase difference between the blade thrust and the radial components can be explained with a different compensation of the thrust and tangential force developed by the blade sections at inner and outer radii as a consequence of different efficiency lift to drag ratio of blade foils it is worth to mention that in jessup et al 1977 a similar behavior was detected for a skewed propeller mounted on a ship model with a transom stern impinged by an inflow inclined in the vertical plane qualitatively analogous to the one represented in fig 7 specifically it resulted that the peak of the blade thrust was delayed by almost 20 past the one of the vertical force experienced at a position close to the nominal one at θ 90 see fig 12a and f in the reference conversely in case of the insean e779a propeller characterized by blades with zero skew c f d simulations of pure oblique flow revealed that the peaks of blade thrust and the dominant in plane force were experienced at blade positions close to the nominal ones see for example figs 11 and 12 in dubbioso et al 2013 see table 4 b e m overestimates k t y with respect to r a n s for all the inflow angles the increase of the percentage error reported in table 5 can be explained with deviations of the self induced velocity field over the disk as a consequence of the tilt of the slipstream looking at fig 12 in more detail it can be deduced that the error of the side force between b e m and r a n s see table 5 is mainly originated during the downstroke motion of the blade consistently with the previous discussion moreover in case of the b e m the percentage increase of k t y in the 2 n d quadrant with respect to 1 s t one is greater with respect to r a n s and according to the considerations in section 5 the resulting side force is greater in case of see table 6 b e m finally in case of b e m t the error of k t z with respect to r a n s is comparable to the boundary element approach fig 11 from figs 13 16 it can be evidenced that the cyclic variation of the blade vertical force is qualitatively captured however similarly to b e m the imbalance of the loads between the upstroke and downstroke phase is under predicted probably because the counteraction of the blade vertical force during the last semi cycle is stronger 6 1 1 pressure distributions the pressure distribution developed on the propeller blades obtained with b e m is compared to r a n s in order to provide a complementary perspective to the effect of the skew and on the discrepancies during the overloading process of the blade c p on the suction pressure side is shown in figs 17 20 for the various conditions investigated in general with the increase of the inclination of the inflow the left to right asymmetry of the blade loads is amplified moreover focusing on the downstroke motion of the blade it can be observed that c p evolves asynchronously in the radial direction in fact in the 1 s t quadrant the inner stations of the blade are more loaded with respect to the outer ones then approaching θ 90 the load increases also at tip finally during the rotation in 2 n d quadrant the blade becomes more loaded at the tip this behavior is consistent with the variation of radial distribution of f x and f t shown in figs 13 16 and the conclusions on the mismatch on the evolution of blade thrust and in plane components in order to further inspect the nature of the discrepancy of the peaks in the span wise distribution the pressure coefficient c p for blade elements at r r 0 65 0 85 and 0 95 are extracted for the blade position at θ 110 and θ 290 in case of the highest rudder angle see fig 21 on the left and right half respectively these blade positions are representative of the highest and lowest propeller loading consequent to high and low angle of incidence consistently with the analysis presented in greco et al 2014 at the position the blade is low loaded i e the mean advance coefficient is high c p predicted with b e m is in good agreement with respect to that achieved by r a n s conversely the comparison is much worse at θ 110 specifically at the inner section the peak of pressure on the suction side of the foil is underpredicted by b e m and moreover c p for the outer sections is not well captured in particular it can be observed that the suction peak at the leading edge for the section at r r 0 85 drops at two different slopes and it is kept in the case of r a n s for a larger fraction of the chord this behavior is magnified for the station at r r 0 95 due to the development in the r a n s calculation of a peak approximately close to the mid chord this phenomenon is related to the leading edge vortex consequent to flow separation at the leading edge and its effect on c p distributions were documented in greco et al 2014 for an highly loaded propeller operating in typical open water conditions and dubbioso et al 2014 for the same propeller operating in severe oblique flow potential based solvers fails in capturing this effect it being viscous in nature and require a dedicated modeling approach tian and kinnas 2014 fig 22 further stresses the different morphology of the tip vortex identified by the q factor developed by the blades at θ 110 and 290 6 2 behind hull condition the analysis in behind hull condition is carried out with the b e m t and b e m solvers and the results are compared to the available experimental data ortolani et al 2015a b the computed loads were properly reduced from the propeller plane to the position of the tail shaft see ortolani et al 2015a equation 1 the components acting on the propeller plane are also considered to discuss the discrepancies of the two models the periodic single blade loads are further inspected and discussed following the simplified description reviewed in section 5 in this case the forces and moments are presented in terms of ratio with respect to values in the approach phase the bearing loads are shown in figs 23 25 and the values obtained with the models are summarized in tables 7 11 experimental data for the in plane moments are missing in the figures because they were not measured in the tables b e m t results are presented in terms of percentage difference with respect to b e m considering the absolute values values of b e m t and experiments are presented in dubbioso et al 2017 and are not repeated for the sake of conciseness periodic blade loads are compared for δ 0 15 and 35 in figs 26 28 boundary element method results reproduce the trend of the experiments and their relative discrepancy is comparable to b e m t the asymmetric overloading of thrust and torque is correctly captured although the error on the internal propeller is considerably higher than external one especially for what regards thrust coefficient in case of the in plane moments the trend of b e m t and b e m is similar with the exception of k q z for the external propeller in terms of absolute value the differences are very large in case of the yaw moment and of the pitching moment on the internal propeller in particular b e m t provides a pitching moment that is opposite signed with respect to b e m during rectilinear motions although the error reported in table 7 is very large the absolute value is considerably smaller with respect to the other moments this is consequent to the higher thrust predicted by b e m t in the upper half of the disk 0 θ 90 270 θ 360 that reverses the vertical imbalance of the disk see fig 26 the deviation between the two signals has to be ascribed to the fact that the blade skew is not modeled in fact the peaks are smoother in case of b e m and phase shifted when the blade rotates past the shaft brackets θ 40 300 during maneuvers the discrepancy of k q y on the internal shaft can be also related to blade skew that acts to reduce and shift the phase of the load this is particularly evident in correspondence to the blade skeg vortex interaction at θ 45 compare solid lines in fig 27 the peak of k t x being reduced by almost 30 in case of b e m in general the difference of the yaw moment k q z is related to the fact that b e m predicts a lower value of blade thrust during the up stroke phase of the cycle and consequently the right left unbalance of the load distribution over the disk is amplified this aspect in case of the external propeller is the principal cause of the deviations between b e m t and b e m in particular for this component in fact it can be observed that the left right asymmetry is gradually enforced with rudder angle considering the in plane loads it is worth noticing that the effects of the blade skew on the peaks for thrust and in plane loads discussed for the pure oblique computations is confirmed in behind hull by the evolution of single blade loads calculated by b e m during the rectilinear motion b e m correctly evaluates the direction of k t y oriented toward the hull centerline this is in contrast to b e m t for both the values at the tail shaft and at the bearing see figs 23 and 24 in fact in case of b e m t the upper half of the disk is more loaded and consequently the side force developed by the blade outward oriented with respect to the plane of symmetry of the ship overcomes the one generated in the lower half similarly to k q y although the error is large the absolute value are smaller than thrust and the vertical force qualitatively the trend of k t y are similar for the two methods and the magnitude is in acceptable agreement compared to b e m the side force obtained with b e m t is greater on the internal shaft and lower on the external one as it can be reasoned by the top to bottom imbalance considerations of the single blade side force it can be observed from figs 27 and 28 that at δ 15 and 35 the side force on the external propeller is lower than b e m t on the upper half of the disk in particular in the 2 s t quadrant 90 θ 180 by contrast on the internal side this trend is overturned the side force obtained by b e m t being higher in the upper half of the disk in particular in the 4 t h quadrant 270 θ 360 with respect to b e m the vertical force k t z calculated with b e m t is in better accordance with experiments on the external propeller in fact in case of b e m the blade exerts an higher vertical force in absolute value for 180 θ 360 with respect to opposite half as it can be also evidenced by the different peak values and a negative force results this trend is gradually amplified with the increase of the rudder angle on the contrary in case of b e m t the vertical force evolves with a symmetric character during the downstroke and upstroke motion of the blade on the internal propeller b e m predicts an higher k t z with respect to the blade element approach although the peak values are smoothed due to the modeling of skew due to the higher discrepancy of the vertical force between the right left halves of the disk as compared to b e m t for the sake of completeness the in plane loads at the bearing location are visualized in fig 25 in terms of resultant radial force and phase angle ϕ ϕ t a n 1 k t z k t y in case of b e m the radial force differs from b e m t on the external shaft due to the over prediction of the downward vertical force the trend of the loads for the b e m solver can be also inspected in terms of pressure coefficient distribution c p on the blades as discussed in the following section 6 2 1 pressure distribution bem solver pressure distribution on the blades is of key importance to evaluate the onset and extension of the cavitation bubble on the blade provided by b e m in the limit of established cavitation modeling techniques and the propeller hull pressure induced loads these aspects are traditionally evaluated for the ideal condition in straight motion and the possibility to identify critical conditions met by the vessel during its life may enhance its operative performance the pressure distribution generated on the propeller blades are shown in figs 29 32 in particular the propeller in straight ahead motion is compared with the one on the internal shaft for the maneuver at δ 15 and with both propellers for the maneuver at δ 35 on the basis of the results discussed for the bearing loads and the analysis shown in dubbioso et al 2017 muscari et al 2017a at these rudder angles the blade skeg vortex interaction and the most severe propeller overloading are experienced respectively consistently with the trend of the bearing loads c p markedly changes in maneuvering conditions with respect to the rectilinear motion note that the range of values is smaller at δ 0 at δ 0 fig 29 c p on the suction side is stronger during the downstroke phase in particular in the 2 n d quadrant these aspects are consistent with the generation of the up ward vertical force and the inward orientation of the side force at δ 15 see fig 30 the pressure increases when the blade is almost horizontal and subsequently the load reduces at the inward stations of the blade the asymmetry between the upstroke and downstroke motion is markedly amplified with respect to the δ 0 as a consequence of the blade vortex interaction at the largest rudder angle this unbalance drops see fig 31 moreover the suction on the descending blade is of comparable magnitude with respect to the previous case as a consequence of the cross flow velocity the blade in the upper half of the disk is overloaded with respect to the ones passing in bottom half on the contrary on the external side fig 32 the situation is inverted and the blade is overloaded in the bottom half due to the concurrent contribution of cross flow and blade rotation the slight asymmetry with respect to the vertical axis is consistent to the negative yaw moment k q z exerted by the propeller to the tail shaft fig 23 7 conclusions in the present paper the capabilities of a b e m and b e m t propeller solvers to describe the propeller performance in maneuvering condition were investigated the analysis was motivated by the necessity to solve off design aspects related to ship and its propulsion system in the earlier design stages in these cases a normal procedure is to model the action of propeller instead of performing the simulations with discretized propeller in order to avoid the burden of computational resources and the excessive time requirements conflicting with ship design schedule the analysis was carried out with an increasing level of complexity the problem of the open water propeller in pure oblique flow was addressed at first and then the problem of the propeller in behind hull condition during steady turning maneuvers was considered the analysis in pure oblique flow consisted of the comparison of the two approaches with the results provided by unsteady r a n s simulation for the open water propeller this study was carried out considering the averaged inflow conditions met by the external propeller for the twin screw considered in the successive part of the investigation this validation study highlighted that in general b e m and b e m t captures the trend and the magnitude of the loads with a satisfactory accuracy the comparison in terms of cyclic blade loads and their radial distribution highlighted the superiority of b e m with respect to the blade element approach because the geometric features of the blade are accounted for in particular the effect of the skew on the performance of the blade entering the variable inflow was one of the peculiar mechanism not captured by b e m t divergence of the boundary element method in respect of r a n s was detected at highest propeller loading due to formation of leading edge vortex in the outer portion of the blade b e m t was reliable in capturing the averaged behavior of the blade and the trends of the cyclic blade loads and distributions the comparison between b e m and b e m t was further broadened for the behind hull condition for the twin screw ships considered this study allowed to further compare the two approaches in case of highly irregular inflow field experienced by the propeller on the leeward side the flow on the opposite one being similar to an oblique flow in this case the hydrodynamic loads were compared with respect to the experimental ones with the exception of the in plane moments the comparison with the experiments should be considered qualitative for various reasons the c f d maneuvering simulations for the computation of the nominal wake did not account for the roll angle and free surface although roll angle monitored during the experiments at the speed considered in the present computations was small the in plane loads can be very sensitive to the distribution of the in plane velocities of the wake moreover the nominal wake provided as input to the propeller solvers was not corrected for propeller hull interactions because of the substantial difference achieved by the physical modeling of the two approaches it can be expected that compensations and cancellation effects occurred for the prediction of the loads from this perspective c f d simulations with fully coupled propeller model would be more indicative and consistent for detailed validation purposes but it was out of the scope of work and it will pursued in future research with this perspective it can be concluded that b e m and b e m t are reliable in capturing the trend and the order of magnitude of the loads in particular b e m was also capable to capture the non linear trend of the vertical force caused by propeller wake interactions phenomena for the leeward propeller the trend of single blade loads corroborated the results for the pure oblique flow specifically the largest discrepancies originated in correspondence of regions of the wake characterized by stronger velocity gradients on this basis it can be concluded that b e m t and b e m are both attractive solutions for interactive coupling with r a n s solvers b e m guarantees a better prediction of the load distribution over the propeller disk i e body forces and consequently can be more accurate than b e m t in evaluating the mean effect of propeller rudder interaction as long as the distribution of the velocity field in the propeller slipstream plays a determinant role however due to the ease of implementation and computational effort b e m t should be preferred to b e m for dynamic ship simulations in order to achieve the response of the vessel in fact in these simulations the propeller solver has to provide the propeller loads at every time step correspondent to the transient dynamic state of the ship due to the large computational time demanded to evaluate the characteristics parameters of the response of the ship the number of time steps is very large consequently b e m t solver is at least one order faster than b e m and the savings in computational time over the complete simulation is undoubtedly advantageous moreover a further strength of b e m t is that it is less stiff than b e m in the sense that it can be easily tuned with modification of lift drag coefficients evaluated by dedicated experiments or accurate numerical simulations additionally b e m can be a posteriori considered to further focus on propulsion aspects for the worse conditions resulted by the coupled b e m t r a n s dynamic simulations although b e m was less satisfactory with respect to b e m t at higher propeller loading it captured the trend of the loads was almost equivalent to b e m t at mild loading conditions in particular for the internal propeller where complex blade wake interactions were highlighted in this regard the b e m can be extremely useful to analyze the unsteady operation of the propeller that can not be inspected with the same accuracy by simpler models for example the pressure field developed on the propeller blades and its side effects this aspect is extremely useful to gain further knowledge on critical aspects related to propulsion system like vibratiory loads cavitation and noise emission during off design operations 
22907,in this study a time domain numerical method using dynamic stiffness matrices is proposed to obtain the characteristics of the vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser due to the large ratio of length to diameter a marine riser is approximated as a cable model based on the finite volume method fvm the cable model of the riseris dividedinto a certain number of segments the dynamic stiffness matrix of each segment reflecting the time varying strain energy and bending stiffness are updated in calculation the total dynamic stiffness matrix of the riser is then obtained by the superposition characteristics of the finite volume method in the nonlinear governing equation of riser s vibration the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by the instantaneous vorticity conserved boundary condition ivcbc method and the equation is solved by the step by step time integration method to obtain the accelerations velocities and displacements of the riser validation of this numerical approach is carried out by comparing the static balance and the dynamic responses with quantities in classical experimental cases for a riser in uniform flow the results show that when the vibration of riser is high order mode vibration the dynamic stiffness matrix cannot be ignored the vortex induced vibration of the given flexible riser has a strong coupling effect between the deformation of riser and flow field in the vibtation of the riser there exists the multiple frequency effect numely adominant frequency co exists with some subordinate frequencies hence the shedding frequencies can no longer be satisfied with the distributions of the strauhal number the wake effect onthe vortex shedding has a stronger 3 dimensional effect at the locations of smaller lateral vibrations the numerical simulations also reveal that the vibration mode increases with the flow velocity keywords vortex induced vibration flexible riser dynamic stiffness matrix bending stiffness multi frequency effect 1 introduction with the exploitation of offshore oil resources moving into deeper waters the ratio of length to diameter l d of marine risers increases rapidly mekha 2001 leading to more complex vibration issues not only temporally but also spatially under the action of ocean current periodic vortices might appear and alternately shed behind risers when the frequency of vortices coincides with the vibration of risers the dangerous vortex induced vibration viv with resonance can be induced a large number of studies have shown that viv not only disrupts the hydrodynamic distribution along the riser but also amplifies the mean drag force vandiver 1983 de wilde and huijsmans 2004 chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005a the significant vibration with large amplitude leads to fatigue damage of risers and reduces their service lives thus for years the viv issue of marine risers has become a focal point for the academia and engineering societies however viv is complicated in mechanism due to the large l d it is difficult to capture the actual vibration characteristics of a riser either through site investigations or by laboratory model tests note that the flow situation in laboratory is always idealized by contrast the more versatile numerical computation has been often chosen by researchers to probe the characteristics of viv kaiktsis et al

an elastic cylinder in a turbulent fluid the arbitrary lagrange euler ale navier stokes equations with large eddy simulation model were applied to model the turbulent flow and the euler bernoulli beam dynamic equation is solved for the vibration of elastic cylinders song et al 2016 proposed a method to obtain the hydrodynamic forces of a flexible riser undergoing viv using the measured strain the tensioned riser was approximated as an euler bernoulli beam and an inverse method was adopted for the calculation of the hydrodynamic forces in the cf and inline il directions bourguet et al 2011 investigated the in line and cross flow vortex induced vibrations of a long cylindrical tensioned beam using three dimensional direct numerical simulation and they found that the flow supplies energy to the structure mainly at the local lock in frequency above all the stiffiness matrix is generally considered asa invariant at the prevous papers however the stiffness matrix is calculated by the strain energy in the fvm and the strain energy is obtained using by the deformation of the riser however the riser deformation is time varying hence the stiffiness matrix shoud consider time varying characteristics in this paper a time domain numerical method using dynamic stiffness matrices is proposed to obtain the characteristics of the vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser the marine riser is approximated as a cable model which is dividedinto a certain number of segments the dynamic stiffness matrix and bending stiffness are updated in calculation the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by the instantaneous vorticity conserved boundary condition ivcbc method newly proposed by pang et al pang and zong 2014 pang et al 2016a 2016b and the nonlinear governing equation of riser s vibration is solved to obtain the accelerations velocities and displacements of the riser by the step by step time integration method the accuracy validity and reliability of this numerical approach had been validated by comparing the static balance and the dynamic responses with quantities in classical experimental cases for a riser in uniform flow the characteristics of viv of flexible riser were researched 2 numerical method 2 1 ivcbc vortex method under the action of ocean current vortices might periodic appear from the surface of riser and alternately shed into the wake which produce the periodic hydrodynamic forces to act on the riser there are usually two kinds of method to calculate the hydrodynamic forces one is grid method and the other is grid free method in our method the riser are divided into infinite cable elements by fvm the periodic forces on each element will be cacluated to form the external force matrix in order to obtain the accurate force matrix the ivcbc vortex method was adopted the ivcbc vortex method is very promising for its following advantages firstly only a small part of the flow region where vorticity appears needs to be calculated thus the method has high efficiency secondly it is a mesh free method for the deformation of deepwater riser it is difficult to use the grid method due to immature feature of the dynamic grid method thirdly in external flows the vortex method can treat boundary without restricting the computational domain to a finite domain fourthly the turbulence model is not needed at high reynolds numbers and lastly this method has been impoved by the circle theorem vortex shedding are observe clearly and the wake modes are also displied vividly the calculation precision has been significantly improved hence the ivcbc vortex method is more suitable to calculate the hydrodynamic forces than the grid method 2 2 the cable model of a marine riser due to considerably large ratio of length to diameter a tensioned marine riser is usually approximated as a cable model so et al 2001 in this work the cable model is adopted to study the vibration characteristics of a riser the riser is discreted into infinite the cable elements based on the theory of the fvm the strain energy is obtained by stretch and bending do formation the governing equation of vibration is built using hamilton theory the specific process are as fellows 2 2 1 cable model when the fvm is used the full length riser is discretized into a certain number of cable elements as shown in fig 1 the uppercases w p e p represent nodes and the points w p e constitute a cable element w p e point w is the middle point between nodes w and p point e is the middle between nodes p and e the mass matrix the damping matrix and the stiffness matrix of each cable element can be obtained by cable structural mechanics then by the superposition rule of the fvm the total mass matrix the total damping matrix and the total stiffness matrix are also be derived 2 2 2 fvm applied to cable element when the vibration mode of riser is a low order and the vibration amplitude is relatively small the deformation of the riser is also small and weak hence the bending stiffness is usually neglected however when the vibration frequency of a riser approach its natural frequency the resonance is produced to induce the large amplitude vibration and high order vibration mode therefore the bending stiffness cannot be neglected in order to improve the calculation accuracy the bending stiffness is introduced to the numeical mode of riser figs 2 and 3 show the sketch and the numerical model of the cable element w p e before and after deformation the length of wp e is defined as the length of a cable element before deformation while the length of w p e after deformation assuming that the strain rates of wp and p e in fig 1 are identical to those of the w p and the p e respectively the strain rates of w p and p e can be expressed as follows 1 ε p e p e p e p e p e p e p e d p e l p e l p e 2 ε p w p w p w p w p w p w p w d p w l p w l p w where the d pe represents the deformed length of p e and d pw represents the deformed length of wp based on eq 1 and 2 the curvature of the cable element k p is derived 3 k p 2 l cot θ p 2 2 l p 1 cos θ p 1 cos θ p whereθ p is the angle between wp and p e after deformation and the cosine term is expressed as follows 4 c o s θ p f p i 1 3 x w i x p i x e i x p i d p e d p w 5 d p e i 1 3 x w i x p i where i is the x y z direction of the nodes the strain energy includes axial strain energy u pɛ and bending strain energy u pb as follows 6 u p u p ε u p b 1 2 e a ε p w 2 l p w 1 2 e a ε p e 2 l p e 1 2 b k p k p 0 2 l p where ea is tensile stiffness b is bending rigidity k p 0 and k p are the curvatures of the cable element before deformation and after deformation respectively l p is the length of the cable element before deformation l pw and l pe are the lengths of the element pw and p e before deformation respectively ε pw and ε pe are the strains of the element pw and p e before deformation respectively 2 2 3 governing equation of vibration to derive the governing equation of riser vibration the hamilton theory is used 7 τ 1 τ 2 δ t u d t τ 1 τ 2 δ w n c d t 0 where δ and w nc are respectively the variation within a specific time and the work done by non conservative force u and t are potential energy and kinetic energy respectively 8 t p 1 n r t p p 1 n r w e 1 2 ρ r x 2 s y 2 s z 2 s d s where t p is the kinetic energy of each finite volume ρ r is linear density of the riser the n r is the total cable elements x s y s z s are coordinates on a cable element the lagrange theory renders the equation of following motion 9 d d t t x w c x u x w e x f r 0 where w c and w e are damping work and external force work f and r are the internal forces and the external forces respectively it follows that the equation of vibration can be written as 10 m x t c x t k x t r t where m c k is the mass matrix the damping and the stiffness matrix respectively 2 3 dynamic analysis the commonly used method for solving a nonlinear system is to discretize the loading history into a series of short time intervals while at each interval a linear system can be well assumed for the dynamic analysis lam et al 2004 the initial dynamic parameters of each time interval are considered in terms of the linear characteristics of the system these parameters are updated by varying stress and strain at each interval in this manner the nonlinear system analysis is transformed into a series of linear system analysis after each time interval the dynamic parameters will have an increment to hold the equilibrium state of the system and to balance the system s deformation 2 3 1 step by step integration method as the system passes the time intervalδt its inertia force drag force and external force at time t δt achieve a new balance the incremental equation equals to the balance equation at time t δt minus the balance equation at time t which can be expressed as 11 δ f i t δ f d t δ f s t δ r t where 12 δ f i t f i t δ t f i t m δ u t δ f d t f d t δ t f d t c t δ u t δ f s t f s t δ t f s t k t δ u t δ r t r t δ t r t in which the lumped mass matrix m is time invariant added mass is not considered and the damping matrix c t and the stiffness matrix k t are time variant to avoid the iteration the tangent slope at the initial point of each time interval is used to evaluate the elements of the damping and stiffness matrices which can be expressed as 13 c i j t d f d i d u j t k i j t d f s i d u j t when eq 12 is substituted into eq 11 the equation of motion for the increment method is in the following familiar form 14 m δ u t c t δ u t k t δ u t δ r t eq 14 is solved by the step by step time intergration method to obtain the acceleration velocities and displacements of the riser the numerical procedures for the dynamic analysis are as follows 1 initialize meshing and calculate the initial coordinates of all nodal points 2 calculate external loads at every time interval 3 determine the riser balance position 4 formulate the total damping matrix and total mass matrix 5 calculate the tangential stiffness matrix and formulate the total dynamic stiffness matrix 6 calculate the effective increment load 7 solve the stiffness equation to obtain the incremental displacement 8 obtain the incremental velocity and acceleration 9 obtain the displacement velocity and acceleration at each time interval note that at each time interval the dynamic stiffness matrix needs to be updated which is presented in the next section 2 3 2 dynamic stiffness matrix considering that the cable model is based on the fvm the stiffness matrix at every time instant is the tangent stiffness matrix of the riser that is dependent on the strain energy as the flexible riser deforms the strain is time varying thus during the dynamic analysis the tangent stiffness matrix keeps changing the numerical procedures of the dynamic stiffness matrix are as follows 1 formulate the internal nodal force vectors of all cable elements 2 formulae the tangent stiffness matrices of all cable elements 3 calculate the unbalanced force of all nodes 4 determine the initial positions of all nodes 5 obtain the incremental nodal coordinates by the nonlinear equation of strain energy 6 update the new coordinates of all nodes 7 check convergence of each iteration 8 if the convergence of the iteration cannot be satisfied go to step 1 when all nodal points satisfy β βd terminate the program 3 verification of the numerical method to identify the calculation precision of the ivcbc vortex method for a single cylinder the numerical simulation of flow around a single cylinder is performed fluid forces and wake patterns simulated by the ivcbc method are compared with other methods and experiments meanwhile sensitivity of numerical results to time step and the discrete number of cable elements is analyzed finally a comparison is made between the cable model and the widely used beam model in analyzing a marine riser 3 1 applicability of the ivcbc method fig 4 shows the mean surface pressure coefficients of the six groups of parameters by the present method together with the experimental result by blevins et al blevins 1984 at re 1 105 all calculation parameters is the same as those of the expriments by blevins from the figure we can observe that the result for number of vortices n 128 and δt 0 05 provides best matches the experimental result to capture smaller eddies for high reynolds numbers a larger n and a smaller δt should be used however the computation burden will grow rapidly in the following simulation n 128 and δt 0 05 are adopted when re is greater than 5 5 104 in other cases n 64 and δt 0 1are used for the transport of convective vorticity the vortex core radius determines the viscous precision and the original location of vortex points in this study the radius given by the traditional method yamamoto et al 2004 lam et al 2004 i e ɛ r c v d t with constant c 2 is utilized in the simulation lam et al 2004 also suggested that δt be in the range of 0 05 0 1 the streamlines of six groups of parameters at t 5 and re 9 5 103 are presented in fig 5 a for comparison the experimental visualization of loc et al loc and bouard 1985 is shown in fig 5 b again it can be seen that the result by n 128 and δt 0 05 agrees best with the experimental result the shear layer requires a large n of 128 on the surface of cylinder to represent the boundary and a high computational precision demands a fine δt of 0 05 3 2 viv of a cylinder in 2 d flow to further validate the accuracy and the reliability of the ivcbc method in simulating viv of a marine riser a single cylinder with elastic supports and in a 2 d uniform flow is investigated the parameters in table 1 come from the experiment by stappenbelt stappenbelt and lalji 2008 m is the mass ratio ζm is damping ratio d is cylinder diameter fn is the fundamental frequency it can be seen that high re falls in the range from 12500 to 66700 fig 6 a shows experimental results of shedding frequencies while fig 6 b illustrates the present simulation results by the ivcbc method apparently there are very good agreement between these two figures proving that the ivcbc vortex method is an effective approach to modeling viv of a cylindrical structure in 2 d flow 3 3 3 d static model influence of the discretized number 50 80 100 of cable elements for a marine riser on the 3 d numerical results is investigated in order to apply the discretized numbers to the different lengths risers the length of the riser is elected 3000 m the parameters of the riser are given in table 2 the static analysis of the flexible riser is performed under a uniform current speed of 0 3 m s the results of equilibrium positions for the three discretized numbers are shown very close to each other in fig 7 this indicates that the numerical convergence has been reached using 80 suffices the discretization requirement in 3 d numerical calculations in many previous researches the riser is modeled as a beam to compare the cable model with the beam model the classical viv experiment of a flexible riser carried out by chaplin et al 2005 is taken as an example the main parameters for the experiment are as the length of the riser is 13 12 m of which 6 5 m is in water riser s outer diameter is 28 mm the top tension is 939 n the mass ratio of the riser including the mass of the internal water is 3 0 its submerged weight is 12 1 n m its bending stiffness is 29 9 n m2 the structural damping measured in free decay tests in air is 0 33 the carriage speed is 0 85 m s fig 8 gives the typical instantaneous mean deflected shapes of the riser by chaplin et al 2005 the beam model lin 2008 and present cable model all of them are comparable 4 numerical results of viv 4 1 validation of the riser numerical model in order to validate our numerical model the classical experiment huang et al 2010 are selected the parameters of numerical simulation model are shown in table 3 it took 5 h 35 min and 28 s to complete the numerical calculation with present numerical method fig 9 shows the vibration modes with respect to u 0 42 m s 0 84 m s from the figure we can observe the main vibration under u 0 42 m s is the second order mode the main vibration under u 0 84 m s is the forth order mode fig 10 shows the cross flow viv root mean square in order to compare the numerical results tognarelli et al 2008 calculated by renolds average navier stoks rans method and experimental results are showed in fig 10 the rends of rms calculated by present method are consistent with those of the experiment and it agrees with the results computed by the rans method on the riser rms fig 11 shows the vibration pattern and vortex contours clearly 4 2 comparison between the dynamic and contant efficients stiffiness matrix fig 12 shows the vibration modes of the riser for u 0 42 m s and u 0 84 m s comparing with fig 9 we can observe vibration modes have small change for u 0 42 m s however the vibration modes for u 0 84 m s have changes fig 13 shows the cross flow viv response rms a d comparison between the simulation results and experimental data from the figures we can observe that the trend calculated by the dynamic stiffness matrix is the same with that calculated by the constant coefficients stiffness matrix when the velocity is 0 42 m s it indicates the tansformation of the riser has very small effect for the stiffness matrix when the velocity equal to 0 84 m s the rms trends between the constant coefficients stiffness matrix and dynamic stiffness matrix have change it indicates the tansformation of the riser begin to affect the stiffness matrix it indicate the influence of the tansformation of the riser cannot be ignored in high modes vibration in order to compare the dynamic and contant efficients stiffiness matrix another classic experimental case was simulated by present numerical mode which experiment is norwegian deepwater programme marintek et al huang et al 2010 trim et al 2005b employed the method of dragging at both ends of riser to study the characteristics of vortex vibration in trondheim pool the computation parameters show in table 4 and the uniform incoming fluiding velocity is 0 4 m s it took 5 h 45 min and 32 s to complete the numerical calculation with present numerical method fig 14 shows the vibration models using the constant coefficient stiffness matrix and dynamic stiffness matrix respectively from the figure we can find the vibration modal is mainly the third order modal vibration state obtained by using the dynamic stiffness matrix becomes steady quickly this conveys that the changing stiffness matrix come from the deformations of the riser further to form a correspondence between the external force and the matrix fig 15 shows the evolution of riser displacement with time and space at 0 4 m s uniform flow using the constant coefficient stiffness matrix and dynamic stiffness matrix respectively it can be seen from the figure that the vibration of riser locks in the third order modal and the vibration trends to be stable after the initial period of oscillation fig 16 shows the cross flow viv response rms a d comparison between the simulation results and previous simulated data in order to be comparision results with cfd baarholm et al 2005 lei and zheng 2016 show in fig 16 from the figures the trends of rms obtained using dynamic stiffness matrix agree well with previous simulation 4 3 vibration coupled with wake in order to show that the results obtained by the present method have the same wake mode as those obtained by other simulation methods the wake model with typical characteristics were given therefore only three kinds of typical characteristics models can be selected in paper so the wakes modes at 1 8l 1 4l 1 2l 3 4l 7 8l were shown fig 17 a shows the wake pattern behind a rigid riser it can be observed there are the same wake models for the different elements however as shown in fig 17 b the wake pattern behind a flexible riser is obviously different especially the 3 d effect fig 18 a b respectively depicts the wake feature at l 8 and l 2 of the riser it can be seen that the wake at l 16 is of p s pattern p is used to express the vortex pairs s is used to express the single vortices the wake at l 4 is of 2s pattern the wake at l 2 is of t pattern distribution of three vortices show t mode the wake at 3l 4 is of p pattern the wake at 15l 16 is of 2s pattern the results clearly demonstrate that the vibration of riser affects the distribution of wake which in turn also affects riser s vibrations all kinds of wake modes reported in many researches can be simulated by present method 5 characteristics of vortex shedding in order to the viv of a 3 d flexible riser is investigated in terms of the parameters in table 5 5 1 vibration modes fig 19 shows the vibration modes of the flexible riser at velocities u 0 2 m s u 0 8 m s u 1 8 m s respectively it can be observed that the vibration of first modeis dominant when the velocity equals to 0 2 m s as velocity increases to 0 8 m s the dominant vibration mode is second when velocity reaches1 6 m s the vibration is dominated by the third mode these results indicate that the vibration mode is controlled by the flow velocity 5 2 vibration frequency of riser fig 20 shows the time history of lift coefficients and the corresponding power spectrums at l 2 if the riser is assumed rigid at u 1 6 m s it can be observed that the amplitude is almost constant and the coefficient varies at a constant frequency this frequency physically is identical to the frequency of vortex shedding it shows that the shedding frequency satisfies the distribution of the strauhal number namely the strauhal number for a riser is a constant to the same reynolds number however if the flexibility of riser is taken into account as shown in fig 21 it can be observed that the time history of lift coefficients is of a non uniform distribution with varying amplitudes the maximum amplitude is greater than the case of rigid riser in fig 20 a in addition the three noticeable frequencies in fig 21 b reveal that they no longer satisfy the distributions of the strauhal number these three close frequencies in the shedding street arise from the coupling effect of structural vibration and wake figs 22 and 23 illustrate the time history of lift coefficient and the corresponding power spectrum for the flexible riser at l 4 and 3l 4 it is obvious that the time histories at l 2 l 4 and 3l 4 considerably differ from each other but they do have a common frequency of 0 54 hz the subordinate frequencies at l 2 and l 4 are due to the coupling effect between flow and vibration 5 3 vibration shape of the riser nodes fig 24 shows the vibration shape of the cable elements on the flexible riser located at 1 3l 2 3l at u 0 2 m s the magnitude of transverse and longitudinal vibrations is represented the ratios between transverse longitudinal and diameter respectively from the figures we can see that the vibration shape of cable elements is visually like at the location where amplitude is large while another vibration shape looks like at the locations where amplitude is small if the results of section 4 4 are also considered herein it can be concluded that at different locations the frequencies of vortex shedding are different there is a single frequency at the locations of large vibration amplitudes while multiple frequencies occur at the locations of small amplitude this implies that the effect of the wake field on vortex shedding tends to have stronger 3 d features at the locations where the vibration is small than those locations where the vibration is large 6 conclusions in this study a numerical method to obtain the characteristics of the vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser is proposed due to the oversized ratio of length to diameter the riser is approximated as a cable model that is divided into a certain number of segments based on the finite volume method fvm the dynamic stiffness matrix of each segment reflecting the changing strain energy and bending stiffness are calculated the total dynamic stiffness matrix of riser is then obtained by the superposition characteristic of the fvm with the hydrodynamic forces calculated by the instantaneous vorticity conserved boundary condition ivcbc method the nonlinear governing equation for vibration is formulated this equation is solved by the step by step time integration method to obtain the velocities accelerations and displacements of riser s vibration validation of this numerical approach is carried out by comparing the static balance and the dynamic responses with those of classical experimental cases the riser vibration the shedding vortex frequencies and coupling effect were calculated and analyzed the results indicate as follows 1 a time domain numerical method to obtain the characteristics of the vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser is proposed based on the finite volume method fvm and ivcbc method considering the dynamic stiffness matrix and the bending stiffness 2 its high computation efficiency means that the computation time is shorter than those of other commercial software as we all know it usually takes more than 100 h to calculate the vortex excited vibration of riser with commercial software however it takes only six hours to calculate the vortex excited vibration of riser with our simulation mode 3 the trends of rms obtained using dynamic stiffness matrix agree well with previous simulation the results obtained with due to the coupling effect of the flexible riser the multiple frequency effect appears whose shedding frequencies can t satisfy the distributions of the strauhal number in which a main frequency and some subordinate frequencies exit at the same time 4 the vibration modal and wake characteristics of viv can be obtained with present numerical computation mode though more simulations and experiments for different re are required for future study the reported computational model can be used as a new simulation model for the vortex induced vibration viv of twin risers in offshore industry the good performance of the ivcbc vortex method can be further extended to investigate three or more cylindrical objects irregularly arranged in space acknowledgements this research is supported by national natural science

22907,in this study a time domain numerical method using dynamic stiffness matrices is proposed to obtain the characteristics of the vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser due to the large ratio of length to diameter a marine riser is approximated as a cable model based on the finite volume method fvm the cable model of the riseris dividedinto a certain number of segments the dynamic stiffness matrix of each segment reflecting the time varying strain energy and bending stiffness are updated in calculation the total dynamic stiffness matrix of the riser is then obtained by the superposition characteristics of the finite volume method in the nonlinear governing equation of riser s vibration the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by the instantaneous vorticity conserved boundary condition ivcbc method and the equation is solved by the step by step time integration method to obtain the accelerations velocities and displacements of the riser validation of this numerical approach is carried out by comparing the static balance and the dynamic responses with quantities in classical experimental cases for a riser in uniform flow the results show that when the vibration of riser is high order mode vibration the dynamic stiffness matrix cannot be ignored the vortex induced vibration of the given flexible riser has a strong coupling effect between the deformation of riser and flow field in the vibtation of the riser there exists the multiple frequency effect numely adominant frequency co exists with some subordinate frequencies hence the shedding frequencies can no longer be satisfied with the distributions of the strauhal number the wake effect onthe vortex shedding has a stronger 3 dimensional effect at the locations of smaller lateral vibrations the numerical simulations also reveal that the vibration mode increases with the flow velocity keywords vortex induced vibration flexible riser dynamic stiffness matrix bending stiffness multi frequency effect 1 introduction with the exploitation of offshore oil resources moving into deeper waters the ratio of length to diameter l d of marine risers increases rapidly mekha 2001 leading to more complex vibration issues not only temporally but also spatially under the action of ocean current periodic vortices might appear and alternately shed behind risers when the frequency of vortices coincides with the vibration of risers the dangerous vortex induced vibration viv with resonance can be induced a large number of studies have shown that viv not only disrupts the hydrodynamic distribution along the riser but also amplifies the mean drag force vandiver 1983 de wilde and huijsmans 2004 chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005a the significant vibration with large amplitude leads to fatigue damage of risers and reduces their service lives thus for years the viv issue of marine risers has become a focal point for the academia and engineering societies however viv is complicated in mechanism due to the large l d it is difficult to capture the actual vibration characteristics of a riser either through site investigations or by laboratory model tests note that the flow situation in laboratory is always idealized by contrast the more versatile numerical computation has been often chosen by researchers to probe the characteristics of viv kaiktsis et al 2007 sarpkaya 2004 there have been many publications about the viv of risers to name some examples herfjord et al 1999 employed a hybrid scheme to examine the fluid structure interaction they used avortex method with a hybrid formulation that requires a mesh to evaluate the diffusion of vorticity constantinides et al constantinides and oakley 2008 employed a three dimensional model with an optimized mesh to analyze high aspect ratio risers results show good agreement with experiments and the ability of the method to simulate the deepwater risers evangelinos et al 2000 used a direct numerical simulation dns based on spectral methods to model the turbulent flow passing flexible cylinders when subjected to viv the structural vibration was modeled by the euler bernoulli beam theory wang et al 2001 used the normal mode method to analyze the structural response also in terms of the euler bernoulli beam willden and graham 2001 used a quasi three dimensional q3d method to simulate the transverse vibration of a l d 1 100 cylinder subjected to shear flow at low reynolds numbers the three dimensional flexible cylinder was modeled as a bending beam with pre tension using a linear finite element implementation of the euler bernoulli beam equations so et al 2001 described a numerical technique that can prevent severe distortion of meshing in simulating flow induced vibration an orthogonally transformed space that is related to the physical space through a laplacian equation was introduced in their study sun et al 2012 employed the euler bernoulli beam theory and the discrete vortex method to investigate the hydro elastic interactions between long oscillating cylinders and fluid loads jaiman rk et al jaiman et al 2009 used the cad integrated tools to investigate the fluid structure interaction fsi of low mass bodies such as flexible marine risers cables with vortex induced vibrations chen et al 2012 simulated riser viv with one and two degree of freedoms dofs using the dynamic meshing technique with light masses and a small damping yamamoto et al 2004 used the discrete vortex method and the stream function based boundary integral method to assess the hydrodynamic forces a consistent static stiffness matrix is obtained through a finite element technique to solve an euler bernoulli beam equation and a truss bar equation holmes et al 2006 implemented the numerical simulations on risers with finite element methods that are tolerant of sparse meshes and high element aspect ratios huang et al 2007 2008 performed the time domain simulations by using an unsteady and overset grid navier stokes method the fluid domain was discretized into nearly one million elements at each time step the drag and lift forces were computed by solving the navier stokes equation the turbulence flow was solved using large eddy simulation les with the smagorinskysubgrid scale turbulence model wu et al 2008 2009 obtained the vortex induced force on a flexible riser in the cross flow cf direction using an inverse estimation method based on a state space formulation of a finite element beam model and an inverse method based on the optimal control theory zhao et al 2010 developed a fluid structure interaction model by solving the viscous navier stokes equation turbulence model and structural dynamic response equation with the dynamic meshing technique joshi et al joshi and jaiman 2017 presented a bound and positively preserving variation method for the turbulence transport equation of spalart allmaras based delayed detached eddy simulation and used the developed solver to simulate the vortex induced vibration of a slender flexible riser immersed in turbulent flow liu et al 2012 2013 carried out numerical studies onthe fluid structure interaction for an elastic cylinder in a turbulent fluid the arbitrary lagrange euler ale navier stokes equations with large eddy simulation model were applied to model the turbulent flow and the euler bernoulli beam dynamic equation is solved for the vibration of elastic cylinders song et al 2016 proposed a method to obtain the hydrodynamic forces of a flexible riser undergoing viv using the measured strain the tensioned riser was approximated as an euler bernoulli beam and an inverse method was adopted for the calculation of the hydrodynamic forces in the cf and inline il directions bourguet et al 2011 investigated the in line and cross flow vortex induced vibrations of a long cylindrical tensioned beam using three dimensional direct numerical simulation and they found that the flow supplies energy to the structure mainly at the local lock in frequency above all the stiffiness matrix is generally considered asa invariant at the prevous papers however the stiffness matrix is calculated by the strain energy in the fvm and the strain energy is obtained using by the deformation of the riser however the riser deformation is time varying hence the stiffiness matrix shoud consider time varying characteristics in this paper a time domain numerical method using dynamic stiffness matrices is proposed to obtain the characteristics of the vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser the marine riser is approximated as a cable model which is dividedinto a certain number of segments the dynamic stiffness matrix and bending stiffness are updated in calculation the hydrodynamic forces are calculated by the instantaneous vorticity conserved boundary condition ivcbc method newly proposed by pang et al pang and zong 2014 pang et al 2016a 2016b and the nonlinear governing equation of riser s vibration is solved to obtain the accelerations velocities and displacements of the riser by the step by step time integration method the accuracy validity and reliability of this numerical approach had been validated by comparing the static balance and the dynamic responses with quantities in classical experimental cases for a riser in uniform flow the characteristics of viv of flexible riser were researched 2 numerical method 2 1 ivcbc vortex method under the action of ocean current vortices might periodic appear from the surface of riser and alternately shed into the wake which produce the periodic hydrodynamic forces to act on the riser there are usually two kinds of method to calculate the hydrodynamic forces one is grid method and the other is grid free method in our method the riser are divided into infinite cable elements by fvm the periodic forces on each element will be cacluated to form the external force matrix in order to obtain the accurate force matrix the ivcbc vortex method was adopted the ivcbc vortex method is very promising for its following advantages firstly only a small part of the flow region where vorticity appears needs to be calculated thus the method has high efficiency secondly it is a mesh free method for the deformation of deepwater riser it is difficult to use the grid method due to immature feature of the dynamic grid method thirdly in external flows the vortex method can treat boundary without restricting the computational domain to a finite domain fourthly the turbulence model is not needed at high reynolds numbers and lastly this method has been impoved by the circle theorem vortex shedding are observe clearly and the wake modes are also displied vividly the calculation precision has been significantly improved hence the ivcbc vortex method is more suitable to calculate the hydrodynamic forces than the grid method 2 2 the cable model of a marine riser due to considerably large ratio of length to diameter a tensioned marine riser is usually approximated as a cable model so et al 2001 in this work the cable model is adopted to study the vibration characteristics of a riser the riser is discreted into infinite the cable elements based on the theory of the fvm the strain energy is obtained by stretch and bending do formation the governing equation of vibration is built using hamilton theory the specific process are as fellows 2 2 1 cable model when the fvm is used the full length riser is discretized into a certain number of cable elements as shown in fig 1 the uppercases w p e p represent nodes and the points w p e constitute a cable element w p e point w is the middle point between nodes w and p point e is the middle between nodes p and e the mass matrix the damping matrix and the stiffness matrix of each cable element can be obtained by cable structural mechanics then by the superposition rule of the fvm the total mass matrix the total damping matrix and the total stiffness matrix are also be derived 2 2 2 fvm applied to cable element when the vibration mode of riser is a low order and the vibration amplitude is relatively small the deformation of the riser is also small and weak hence the bending stiffness is usually neglected however when the vibration frequency of a riser approach its natural frequency the resonance is produced to induce the large amplitude vibration and high order vibration mode therefore the bending stiffness cannot be neglected in order to improve the calculation accuracy the bending stiffness is introduced to the numeical mode of riser figs 2 and 3 show the sketch and the numerical model of the cable element w p e before and after deformation the length of wp e is defined as the length of a cable element before deformation while the length of w p e after deformation assuming that the strain rates of wp and p e in fig 1 are identical to those of the w p and the p e respectively the strain rates of w p and p e can be expressed as follows 1 ε p e p e p e p e p e p e p e d p e l p e l p e 2 ε p w p w p w p w p w p w p w d p w l p w l p w where the d pe represents the deformed length of p e and d pw represents the deformed length of wp based on eq 1 and 2 the curvature of the cable element k p is derived 3 k p 2 l cot θ p 2 2 l p 1 cos θ p 1 cos θ p whereθ p is the angle between wp and p e after deformation and the cosine term is expressed as follows 4 c o s θ p f p i 1 3 x w i x p i x e i x p i d p e d p w 5 d p e i 1 3 x w i x p i where i is the x y z direction of the nodes the strain energy includes axial strain energy u pɛ and bending strain energy u pb as follows 6 u p u p ε u p b 1 2 e a ε p w 2 l p w 1 2 e a ε p e 2 l p e 1 2 b k p k p 0 2 l p where ea is tensile stiffness b is bending rigidity k p 0 and k p are the curvatures of the cable element before deformation and after deformation respectively l p is the length of the cable element before deformation l pw and l pe are the lengths of the element pw and p e before deformation respectively ε pw and ε pe are the strains of the element pw and p e before deformation respectively 2 2 3 governing equation of vibration to derive the governing equation of riser vibration the hamilton theory is used 7 τ 1 τ 2 δ t u d t τ 1 τ 2 δ w n c d t 0 where δ and w nc are respectively the variation within a specific time and the work done by non conservative force u and t are potential energy and kinetic energy respectively 8 t p 1 n r t p p 1 n r w e 1 2 ρ r x 2 s y 2 s z 2 s d s where t p is the kinetic energy of each finite volume ρ r is linear density of the riser the n r is the total cable elements x s y s z s are coordinates on a cable element the lagrange theory renders the equation of following motion 9 d d t t x w c x u x w e x f r 0 where w c and w e are damping work and external force work f and r are the internal forces and the external forces respectively it follows that the equation of vibration can be written as 10 m x t c x t k x t r t where m c k is the mass matrix the damping and the stiffness matrix respectively 2 3 dynamic analysis the commonly used method for solving a nonlinear system is to discretize the loading history into a series of short time intervals while at each interval a linear system can be well assumed for the dynamic analysis lam et al 2004 the initial dynamic parameters of each time interval are considered in terms of the linear characteristics of the system these parameters are updated by varying stress and strain at each interval in this manner the nonlinear system analysis is transformed into a series of linear system analysis after each time interval the dynamic parameters will have an increment to hold the equilibrium state of the system and to balance the system s deformation 2 3 1 step by step integration method as the system passes the time intervalδt its inertia force drag force and external force at time t δt achieve a new balance the incremental equation equals to the balance equation at time t δt minus the balance equation at time t which can be expressed as 11 δ f i t δ f d t δ f s t δ r t where 12 δ f i t f i t δ t f i t m δ u t δ f d t f d t δ t f d t c t δ u t δ f s t f s t δ t f s t k t δ u t δ r t r t δ t r t in which the lumped mass matrix m is time invariant added mass is not considered and the damping matrix c t and the stiffness matrix k t are time variant to avoid the iteration the tangent slope at the initial point of each time interval is used to evaluate the elements of the damping and stiffness matrices which can be expressed as 13 c i j t d f d i d u j t k i j t d f s i d u j t when eq 12 is substituted into eq 11 the equation of motion for the increment method is in the following familiar form 14 m δ u t c t δ u t k t δ u t δ r t eq 14 is solved by the step by step time intergration method to obtain the acceleration velocities and displacements of the riser the numerical procedures for the dynamic analysis are as follows 1 initialize meshing and calculate the initial coordinates of all nodal points 2 calculate external loads at every time interval 3 determine the riser balance position 4 formulate the total damping matrix and total mass matrix 5 calculate the tangential stiffness matrix and formulate the total dynamic stiffness matrix 6 calculate the effective increment load 7 solve the stiffness equation to obtain the incremental displacement 8 obtain the incremental velocity and acceleration 9 obtain the displacement velocity and acceleration at each time interval note that at each time interval the dynamic stiffness matrix needs to be updated which is presented in the next section 2 3 2 dynamic stiffness matrix considering that the cable model is based on the fvm the stiffness matrix at every time instant is the tangent stiffness matrix of the riser that is dependent on the strain energy as the flexible riser deforms the strain is time varying thus during the dynamic analysis the tangent stiffness matrix keeps changing the numerical procedures of the dynamic stiffness matrix are as follows 1 formulate the internal nodal force vectors of all cable elements 2 formulae the tangent stiffness matrices of all cable elements 3 calculate the unbalanced force of all nodes 4 determine the initial positions of all nodes 5 obtain the incremental nodal coordinates by the nonlinear equation of strain energy 6 update the new coordinates of all nodes 7 check convergence of each iteration 8 if the convergence of the iteration cannot be satisfied go to step 1 when all nodal points satisfy β βd terminate the program 3 verification of the numerical method to identify the calculation precision of the ivcbc vortex method for a single cylinder the numerical simulation of flow around a single cylinder is performed fluid forces and wake patterns simulated by the ivcbc method are compared with other methods and experiments meanwhile sensitivity of numerical results to time step and the discrete number of cable elements is analyzed finally a comparison is made between the cable model and the widely used beam model in analyzing a marine riser 3 1 applicability of the ivcbc method fig 4 shows the mean surface pressure coefficients of the six groups of parameters by the present method together with the experimental result by blevins et al blevins 1984 at re 1 105 all calculation parameters is the same as those of the expriments by blevins from the figure we can observe that the result for number of vortices n 128 and δt 0 05 provides best matches the experimental result to capture smaller eddies for high reynolds numbers a larger n and a smaller δt should be used however the computation burden will grow rapidly in the following simulation n 128 and δt 0 05 are adopted when re is greater than 5 5 104 in other cases n 64 and δt 0 1are used for the transport of convective vorticity the vortex core radius determines the viscous precision and the original location of vortex points in this study the radius given by the traditional method yamamoto et al 2004 lam et al 2004 i e ɛ r c v d t with constant c 2 is utilized in the simulation lam et al 2004 also suggested that δt be in the range of 0 05 0 1 the streamlines of six groups of parameters at t 5 and re 9 5 103 are presented in fig 5 a for comparison the experimental visualization of loc et al loc and bouard 1985 is shown in fig 5 b again it can be seen that the result by n 128 and δt 0 05 agrees best with the experimental result the shear layer requires a large n of 128 on the surface of cylinder to represent the boundary and a high computational precision demands a fine δt of 0 05 3 2 viv of a cylinder in 2 d flow to further validate the accuracy and the reliability of the ivcbc method in simulating viv of a marine riser a single cylinder with elastic supports and in a 2 d uniform flow is investigated the parameters in table 1 come from the experiment by stappenbelt stappenbelt and lalji 2008 m is the mass ratio ζm is damping ratio d is cylinder diameter fn is the fundamental frequency it can be seen that high re falls in the range from 12500 to 66700 fig 6 a shows experimental results of shedding frequencies while fig 6 b illustrates the present simulation results by the ivcbc method apparently there are very good agreement between these two figures proving that the ivcbc vortex method is an effective approach to modeling viv of a cylindrical structure in 2 d flow 3 3 3 d static model influence of the discretized number 50 80 100 of cable elements for a marine riser on the 3 d numerical results is investigated in order to apply the discretized numbers to the different lengths risers the length of the riser is elected 3000 m the parameters of the riser are given in table 2 the static analysis of the flexible riser is performed under a uniform current speed of 0 3 m s the results of equilibrium positions for the three discretized numbers are shown very close to each other in fig 7 this indicates that the numerical convergence has been reached using 80 suffices the discretization requirement in 3 d numerical calculations in many previous researches the riser is modeled as a beam to compare the cable model with the beam model the classical viv experiment of a flexible riser carried out by chaplin et al 2005 is taken as an example the main parameters for the experiment are as the length of the riser is 13 12 m of which 6 5 m is in water riser s outer diameter is 28 mm the top tension is 939 n the mass ratio of the riser including the mass of the internal water is 3 0 its submerged weight is 12 1 n m its bending stiffness is 29 9 n m2 the structural damping measured in free decay tests in air is 0 33 the carriage speed is 0 85 m s fig 8 gives the typical instantaneous mean deflected shapes of the riser by chaplin et al 2005 the beam model lin 2008 and present cable model all of them are comparable 4 numerical results of viv 4 1 validation of the riser numerical model in order to validate our numerical model the classical experiment huang et al 2010 are selected the parameters of numerical simulation model are shown in table 3 it took 5 h 35 min and 28 s to complete the numerical calculation with present numerical method fig 9 shows the vibration modes with respect to u 0 42 m s 0 84 m s from the figure we can observe the main vibration under u 0 42 m s is the second order mode the main vibration under u 0 84 m s is the forth order mode fig 10 shows the cross flow viv root mean square in order to compare the numerical results tognarelli et al 2008 calculated by renolds average navier stoks rans method and experimental results are showed in fig 10 the rends of rms calculated by present method are consistent with those of the experiment and it agrees with the results computed by the rans method on the riser rms fig 11 shows the vibration pattern and vortex contours clearly 4 2 comparison between the dynamic and contant efficients stiffiness matrix fig 12 shows the vibration modes of the riser for u 0 42 m s and u 0 84 m s comparing with fig 9 we can observe vibration modes have small change for u 0 42 m s however the vibration modes for u 0 84 m s have changes fig 13 shows the cross flow viv response rms a d comparison between the simulation results and experimental data from the figures we can observe that the trend calculated by the dynamic stiffness matrix is the same with that calculated by the constant coefficients stiffness matrix when the velocity is 0 42 m s it indicates the tansformation of the riser has very small effect for the stiffness matrix when the velocity equal to 0 84 m s the rms trends between the constant coefficients stiffness matrix and dynamic stiffness matrix have change it indicates the tansformation of the riser begin to affect the stiffness matrix it indicate the influence of the tansformation of the riser cannot be ignored in high modes vibration in order to compare the dynamic and contant efficients stiffiness matrix another classic experimental case was simulated by present numerical mode which experiment is norwegian deepwater programme marintek et al huang et al 2010 trim et al 2005b employed the method of dragging at both ends of riser to study the characteristics of vortex vibration in trondheim pool the computation parameters show in table 4 and the uniform incoming fluiding velocity is 0 4 m s it took 5 h 45 min and 32 s to complete the numerical calculation with present numerical method fig 14 shows the vibration models using the constant coefficient stiffness matrix and dynamic stiffness matrix respectively from the figure we can find the vibration modal is mainly the third order modal vibration state obtained by using the dynamic stiffness matrix becomes steady quickly this conveys that the changing stiffness matrix come from the deformations of the riser further to form a correspondence between the external force and the matrix fig 15 shows the evolution of riser displacement with time and space at 0 4 m s uniform flow using the constant coefficient stiffness matrix and dynamic stiffness matrix respectively it can be seen from the figure that the vibration of riser locks in the third order modal and the vibration trends to be stable after the initial period of oscillation fig 16 shows the cross flow viv response rms a d comparison between the simulation results and previous simulated data in order to be comparision results with cfd baarholm et al 2005 lei and zheng 2016 show in fig 16 from the figures the trends of rms obtained using dynamic stiffness matrix agree well with previous simulation 4 3 vibration coupled with wake in order to show that the results obtained by the present method have the same wake mode as those obtained by other simulation methods the wake model with typical characteristics were given therefore only three kinds of typical characteristics models can be selected in paper so the wakes modes at 1 8l 1 4l 1 2l 3 4l 7 8l were shown fig 17 a shows the wake pattern behind a rigid riser it can be observed there are the same wake models for the different elements however as shown in fig 17 b the wake pattern behind a flexible riser is obviously different especially the 3 d effect fig 18 a b respectively depicts the wake feature at l 8 and l 2 of the riser it can be seen that the wake at l 16 is of p s pattern p is used to express the vortex pairs s is used to express the single vortices the wake at l 4 is of 2s pattern the wake at l 2 is of t pattern distribution of three vortices show t mode the wake at 3l 4 is of p pattern the wake at 15l 16 is of 2s pattern the results clearly demonstrate that the vibration of riser affects the distribution of wake which in turn also affects riser s vibrations all kinds of wake modes reported in many researches can be simulated by present method 5 characteristics of vortex shedding in order to the viv of a 3 d flexible riser is investigated in terms of the parameters in table 5 5 1 vibration modes fig 19 shows the vibration modes of the flexible riser at velocities u 0 2 m s u 0 8 m s u 1 8 m s respectively it can be observed that the vibration of first modeis dominant when the velocity equals to 0 2 m s as velocity increases to 0 8 m s the dominant vibration mode is second when velocity reaches1 6 m s the vibration is dominated by the third mode these results indicate that the vibration mode is controlled by the flow velocity 5 2 vibration frequency of riser fig 20 shows the time history of lift coefficients and the corresponding power spectrums at l 2 if the riser is assumed rigid at u 1 6 m s it can be observed that the amplitude is almost constant and the coefficient varies at a constant frequency this frequency physically is identical to the frequency of vortex shedding it shows that the shedding frequency satisfies the distribution of the strauhal number namely the strauhal number for a riser is a constant to the same reynolds number however if the flexibility of riser is taken into account as shown in fig 21 it can be observed that the time history of lift coefficients is of a non uniform distribution with varying amplitudes the maximum amplitude is greater than the case of rigid riser in fig 20 a in addition the three noticeable frequencies in fig 21 b reveal that they no longer satisfy the distributions of the strauhal number these three close frequencies in the shedding street arise from the coupling effect of structural vibration and wake figs 22 and 23 illustrate the time history of lift coefficient and the corresponding power spectrum for the flexible riser at l 4 and 3l 4 it is obvious that the time histories at l 2 l 4 and 3l 4 considerably differ from each other but they do have a common frequency of 0 54 hz the subordinate frequencies at l 2 and l 4 are due to the coupling effect between flow and vibration 5 3 vibration shape of the riser nodes fig 24 shows the vibration shape of the cable elements on the flexible riser located at 1 3l 2 3l at u 0 2 m s the magnitude of transverse and longitudinal vibrations is represented the ratios between transverse longitudinal and diameter respectively from the figures we can see that the vibration shape of cable elements is visually like at the location where amplitude is large while another vibration shape looks like at the locations where amplitude is small if the results of section 4 4 are also considered herein it can be concluded that at different locations the frequencies of vortex shedding are different there is a single frequency at the locations of large vibration amplitudes while multiple frequencies occur at the locations of small amplitude this implies that the effect of the wake field on vortex shedding tends to have stronger 3 d features at the locations where the vibration is small than those locations where the vibration is large 6 conclusions in this study a numerical method to obtain the characteristics of the vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser is proposed due to the oversized ratio of length to diameter the riser is approximated as a cable model that is divided into a certain number of segments based on the finite volume method fvm the dynamic stiffness matrix of each segment reflecting the changing strain energy and bending stiffness are calculated the total dynamic stiffness matrix of riser is then obtained by the superposition characteristic of the fvm with the hydrodynamic forces calculated by the instantaneous vorticity conserved boundary condition ivcbc method the nonlinear governing equation for vibration is formulated this equation is solved by the step by step time integration method to obtain the velocities accelerations and displacements of riser s vibration validation of this numerical approach is carried out by comparing the static balance and the dynamic responses with those of classical experimental cases the riser vibration the shedding vortex frequencies and coupling effect were calculated and analyzed the results indicate as follows 1 a time domain numerical method to obtain the characteristics of the vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible riser is proposed based on the finite volume method fvm and ivcbc method considering the dynamic stiffness matrix and the bending stiffness 2 its high computation efficiency means that the computation time is shorter than those of other commercial software as we all know it usually takes more than 100 h to calculate the vortex excited vibration of riser with commercial software however it takes only six hours to calculate the vortex excited vibration of riser with our simulation mode 3 the trends of rms obtained using dynamic stiffness matrix agree well with previous simulation the results obtained with due to the coupling effect of the flexible riser the multiple frequency effect appears whose shedding frequencies can t satisfy the distributions of the strauhal number in which a main frequency and some subordinate frequencies exit at the same time 4 the vibration modal and wake characteristics of viv can be obtained with present numerical computation mode though more simulations and experiments for different re are required for future study the reported computational model can be used as a new simulation model for the vortex induced vibration viv of twin risers in offshore industry the good performance of the ivcbc vortex method can be further extended to investigate three or more cylindrical objects irregularly arranged in space acknowledgements this research is supported by national natural science

22908,ship impact is a potential hazard for bridge piers located in navigation waterways to avoid direct contact between the ship and the pier protective structures of different types are currently widely used in bridge designs against ship impact as one of these protective structures the flexible floating device has drawn much attention in recent years the main advantage of this device lies in its low cost and its ability to float on water surface regardless of water elevation this paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a flexible floating anti collision device adopted in the zhanjiang bay bridge located in guangdong province china using finite element models detailed illustrations of the structural configurations are provided in addition finite element models of the ship and the floating device with calibrations using experimental data are developed the influences of several factors upon the ability of the device to turn the navigation direction of the ship the energy dissipation capacity of the device and the effectiveness of the device for reducing the impact force on the pier are thoroughly evaluated using the validated finite element models keywords ship impact protective structures floating device finite element models experimental data 1 introduction with the rapid growth of trade and the remarkable advancement of modern science and technology a large number of bridges spanning over navigation waterways have been built during the last decade these bridge piers located in navigation waterways are very susceptible to ship impact due to the increase of ship transportation volume it was pointed out by manen and frandsen manen et al 1998 and larsen 1993 previously that at least one major vessel bridge collision accident of serious consequences occurred each year on average in the past such collisions can often lead to catastrophic consequences including human casualties and economic losses thus direct contact between the ship and the pier should be avoided pier protection from ship collision has led to substantial scientific investigations in the past decade sha and hao 2015 saul et al 2001 morgenthal and saul 2005 knott 1986 simonsen and ottesen hansen 1998 svensson 2009 wang et al 2008 wang and morgenthal 2018a protective structures such as dolphin structures saul et al 2001 morgenthal and saul 2005 knott 1986 artificial islands simonsen and ottesen hansen 1998 and guiding structures svensson 2009 are currently extensively used in bridge designs against ship impact however those structures often suffer from problems such as high cost great construction difficulties and the inability to float on water surface another technique is to strengthen the pier itself using carbon fibre reinforced polymers cfrp sha and hao 2015 such strengthening technique can improve the pier resistance for ship impact however it cannot reduce the maximum impact force thus it is effective for pier protection but not for ship protection sha and hao 2015 during a ship collision a portion of impact energy is transformed into the residual kinetic energy of the ship whilst the rest of impact energy is dissipated through plastic deformations of the ship and the impacted structure in order to protect a bridge pier from ship impact and avoid large plastic deformations of the ship under different water elevations it is necessary to devise a crashworthy device that can float on water surface and can absorb a large portion of impact energy in this way the amount of energy absorbed by the pier and the ship during impact can be much reduced so that both the pier and the ship can be protected based on this concept flexible floating anti collision devices comprised of steel and rubber have been developed and frequently used in china for bridges such as the yangtze river highway bridge located in hubei province china chen 2017 the zhanjiang bay bridge located in guangdong province china chen and wang 2006 the xiangshan bridge located in zhejiang province china lv et al 2014 etc such devices are often used in locations where the water elevation experiences dramatic changes during the year no connection components between the device and the pier are needed thus the installation difficulties can be much reduced during a ship collision the floating device can keep the pier from direct contact with the ship and can absorb a large amount of impact energy through plastic deformations leading to a reduction of impact force transmitted to the pier in addition the outline of the device can be designed to turn the navigation direction of the ship during impact and consequently the amount of energy absorbed by the ship and the device can be reduced chen et al chen and wang 2006 devised a flexible floating device which was installed on zhan jiang bay bridge located in guangdong province china this device is comprised of a series of steel wire rope coils connected in parallel between one outer and one inner floating steel periphery wang et al 2008 have numerically analyzed the mechanical properties of this device using one single ship model however the steel wire rope coils are represented by a uni axial nonlinear viscoelastic model which could be insufficient as in reality it s unlikely that all coils deform in one single direction during impact in addition only one type of ship is used for the analysis whilst ships of different tonnages bow configurations etc are employed in navigation this paper thus aims to develop reliable finite element models of several different types of ships and the floating device emphasizing on the steel wire rope coils with calibrations using experimental data and use such finite element models to investigate the effectiveness of the device for turning the navigation direction of ships the energy dissipation capacity of the device and the effectiveness of the device for reducing the impact force on the pier 2 configuration of the device the flexible floating device studied here is comprised of four parts i e the outer floating steel periphery the middle steel periphery the inner floating steel periphery and a series of flexible steel wire rope coils connecting the three steel peripheries as shown in detail in fig 1 the device surrounds the bridge pier which is to be protected from ship impact each steel wire rope coil is wrapped by the rubber from outside during a ship collision the coils are able to dissipate the impact energy through plastic deformations and heat generation by friction between steel wires the particular geometric outline of the outer floating steel periphery is also expected to be capable of changing the navigation direction of the ship during impact reducing the amount of impact energy that needs to be dissipated through plastic deformations of the ship and the protective device 3 finite element models finite element simulations have been currently extensively used for dynamic analysis of impact scenarios such as barge pier impact sha and hao 2013 yuan 2005 wang and morgenthal 2017 2018b barge floodwall impact getter et al 2015 ship iceberg impact liu et al 2011 gao et al 2015 ship ship impact yagi et al 2009 ship impact with oil rigs travanca and hao 2015 etc to conduct such simulations reliable finite element models of the impacting ship and the impacted structure are needed in this section the finite element models of ships and flexible floating device and model validations using data from experimental impact tests are presented 3 1 finite element models of the ships the main pylon of zhanjiang bay bridge is designed to resist the impact from a 50000 dwt ship chen 2017 here three ships of 52300 dwt 50000 dwt and 5000 dwt respectively are selected to investigate the effectiveness of the flexible floating device for different types of ships the fully loaded displacements of the three ships are 68000 ton 62000 ton and 6710 ton respectively the detailed drawings of the ships are used for developing the finite element models the corresponding parameters regarding the ships are available in refs wang et al 2008 2012 chen 2017 each ship is divided into two zones namely the ship bow and the ship hull respectively previous studies fan and yuan 2014 chen 2006 have indicated that during a high energy ship collision the ship bow generally experiences dramatic plastic deformations whilst the ship hull undergoes only small elastic deformations for this reason the ship bows are modeled using fine meshes whilst the ship hulls are modeled using course meshes for simplification purposes all ships are modeled entirely using shell elements totaling 29137 159225 and 61320 for 52300 dwt 50000 dwt and 5000 dwt ships respectively the finite element models of the three ships are presented in fig 2 including the detailed modelings of the ship bows the ship bows are modeled using shell elements with consideration of material plasticity the engineering stress strain curves of the steel used here were obtained from tensile tests and the true stress strain curves are generated by the following equations paik 2006 1 σ t f ε e σ e 1 ε e 2 ε t ln 1 ε e where ε e is the engineering strain σ e is the engineering stress ε t is the true strain σ t is the true stress and f ε e is the knock down factor function described in detail as per ref paik 2006 eq 1 and eq 2 were proved to be the most appropriate to model the stress versus strain characteristics of steel paik 2006 2007 the true stress strain curves of the steel used in this study are plotted in fig 3 for saving the computational cost the bi linear elastoplastic material model mat plastic kinematic is adopted here for the steel within the ship bows as demonstrated in fig 3 the related material parameters regarding the steel are tabulated in table 1 fig 3 shows that the bi linear curves match well with the corresponding true stress strain curves within the measured strain range the ship hulls are modeled using rigid material model mat rigid for saving the computational cost 3 2 finite element model of the floating device to predict the deformation processes of the flexible floating device subjected to ship impact with sufficient accuracy it is important to generate a numerical model that can represent the main mechanical features of the device in a reasonable way here the members of the floating device are modeled based on their true configurations from the drawings as depicted in fig 4 6 where the steel structural members i e the outer the middle and the inner floating steel periphery are modeled using shell elements with bi linear elastoplastic material model mat plastic kinematic the true stress strain curve and the bi linear curve of the structural steel used in the device are plotted in fig 3 and the related material parameters regarding the steel are tabulated in table 2 after careful convergence tests the steel structural members of the device are meshed using 496910 shell elements with minimum and maximum mesh size of 50 mm and 300 mm respectively it is noteworthy that the technique adopted here for modeling the steel structural members subjected to impact loading has been validated using experimental data generated by a series of drop hammer impact tests on scaled steel boxes conducted by wang et al wang et al 2018 it is noteworthy that using the bi linear elastoplastic material model instead of the true stress strain curves for the structural steel of the ship and the floating device won t change the relative strength between the ship and the device markedly and consequently the energy dissipation process during impact is not expected to be obviously influenced nevertheless the absolute values of some related results e g duration and peak of impact forces could be slightly influenced however the main objective of this study is to investigate the overall effectiveness of the proposed floating device for pier protection from barge impact the slight difference in duration and peak of impact forces introduced by using the bi linear stress strain curves is considered insignificant and is thus ignored in this study the steel wire rope coil used in the floating device shows some non linear viscoelastic properties based on the experimental impact test conducted by chen and wang 2006 as shown in fig 7 where the axial loading and unloading force displacement curve of the coil is obtained through the compressive impact loading generated by a drop hammer weighing 6000 kg with an impact velocity of 4 m s as it is required by the harbour administration that the travelling velocity of the ship should not exceed 4 m s when crossing the bridge fig 7 shows that the force increases slowly when the axial displacement of the coil is less than 350 mm however when the axial displacement exceeds 350 mm the force starts to increase rapidly until the unloading stage the area of the plane 32 434 kj within the hysteresis loop after one loading and unloading cycle represents the amount of energy dissipated by the coil during impact results indicate the ideal energy dissipation capacity of the coil subjected to impact loading enabling the floating device to dissipate a large amount of energy during impact the finite element model of the steel wire rope coil subjected to impact loading as shown in fig 8 is developed with model validation using the experimental results presented above other than using single spring models to represent the axial resistance of each coil as demonstrated in refs wang et al 2008 zhao et al 2014 this study models the coil using solid elements totaling 530 for each coil to better reflect the complex mechanical behaviour of the coil during impact mat viscoelastic is used to model the non linear viscoelastic properties of the coil this material model is easy to use as only five parameters i e mass density elastic bulk modulus short time shear modulus long time shear modulus and decay constant need to be specified detailed introduction of this material model is provided by ref hallquist 2003 the values of these five parameters as tabulated in table 3 are determined in such a way that the numerical simulation results i e peak impact force maximum displacement and dissipated amount of energy match those obtained from the experimental impact test with sufficient accuracy as provided in table 4 which shows that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results the loading and unloading curve of the coil generated by the finite element model also shows a good agreement with that obtained from the experimental impact test as shown in fig 9 3 3 finite element model of the bridge pier as the objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of the flexible floating device the complex deformation processes of the bridge pier during impact is not considered and thus the pier is assumed to be rigid the pier is entirely modeled using solid elements with rigid material model mat rigid automatic surface to surface contact is used to define the contact between the ship and the impacted structure whilst automatic single surface contact is used to define the contact among the members inside the ship or the floating device chen 2017 wang et al 2012 4 case studies previous studies wang et al 2008 have shown that when the ship can be turned away from its original navigation direction most of the initial kinetic energy remains on the ship and consequently the ship the device and the pier can all be protected however when the ship cannot be turned away during impact most of the impact energy will be transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device the ability of the device to turn the ship away during impact is thus critical for the protection of the ship the device and the pier in this section the influence of several factors i e the stiffness of ship bow the stiffness of the outer periphery of the device the existence of the steel wire rope coils and ship impact energy upon the ability of the device to turn the ship away during impact is thoroughly investigated in addition the energy dissipation capacity of the device and the effectiveness of the device for reducing the impact force on the protected bridge pier are also evaluated in this section here the assumed impact position on the device is shown in fig 10 where the impact velocity v 0 and impact angle θ are also illustrated it should be noted that the impact scenarios considered here are actually ideal cases where the complex hydrodynamic effects from the surrounding water are not included in current simulations for simplification purposes the ship is assumed to be moving in a straight line without yawing before it touches the impacted structure such ideal impact scenarios may deviate from the realistic cases however the objective of this paper is to investigate the mechanical properties of the protective device subjected to ship impact which are not influenced by the complex global behaviors of the ship the hydrodynamic effects upon the ship movement from the surrounding water and the added mass components need to be considered in future work to better predict the dynamic responses of the protective device subjected to ship impact 4 1 stiffness of ship bow here two fully loaded ships i e the 52300 dwt ship and the 50000 dwt ship respectively with the same impact velocities of 4 m s and impact angles of 0 are simulated the tonnages of the two ships are approximately the same the major difference between the two ships is the configuration of the ship bows as more internal trusses are used in the bow of the 50000 dwt ship resulting in a larger stiffness of the bow of the 50000 dwt ship than that of the 52300 dwt ship the simulation results corresponding to the two ships can thus be used to evaluate the influence of ship bow stiffness upon the ability of the floating device to turn the navigation direction of the ship the initial position and direction of the ship before impact the position and direction of the ship after impact and the damage to the floating device after impact corresponding to each of the two ships are shown in fig 11 which shows that the navigation direction of the 52300 dwt ship is successfully turned after impact whilst the 50000 dwt ship keeps on moving forward without being turned this is because the outer steel periphery undergoes more serious damages when impacted by the 50000 dwt ship due to the larger stiffness of the ship bow and consequently the ship gets stuck in the device after impact without being turned as fig 11 shows however when impacted by the 52300 dwt ship the geometric outline of the outer steel periphery after impact although undergoes apparently large plastic deformations still allows the ship to slide along until the ship is turned the energy transformation process during impact corresponding to the 52300 dwt fully loaded ship and the 50000 dwt fully loaded ship respectively is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that when the device is impacted by the 52300 dwt fully loaded ship which can be turned after impact a portion around 59 2 of the kinetic energy is transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device whilst the rest of the kinetic energy is carried off by the ship after being turned however when the device is impacted by the 50000 dwt fully loaded ship which cannot be turned after impact most around 87 1 of the kinetic energy is transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device resulting in serious damages to the outer steel periphery as fig 11 shows the amount of internal energy absorbed by each of the impacting or impacted member and the corresponding ratio to the total internal energy in percentage are tabulated in tables 5 and 6 corresponding to the 52300 dwt ship and the 50000 dwt ship respectively results indicate that most of the internal energy is absorbed by the outer steel periphery the inner steel periphery and the steel wire rope coils whilst the ship bow absorbs merely a small amount of internal energy thus the device is effective for ship protection it should be noted that there is no marked difference between the final internal energy values and those measured at t 4s the structure is highly flexible and undergoes a large plastic deformation after a high energy impact event which enables the structure to absorb a large amount of impact energy and the elastic deformation is rather insignificant compared with the plastic deformation so the final value of internal energy is only slightly lower than the maximum internal energy during impact it can be seen from the top plot of fig 12 that for the 52300 dwt ship the internal energy already reaches the maximum value it can be seen from the bottom plot of fig 12 that for the 50000 dwt ship the internal energy is about to reach the maximum and an increase until the maximum value after 4s is not deemed to be significant as the internal energy value at t 4s is already not far away from the total impact energy and such an insignificant increase can be compensated by the slight decrease until the plateau value so there is no obvious difference between the final internal energy values and those measured at t 4s another important aspect which engineering designs should concern is the magnitude of impact force imposed on the protected bridge pier it is thus necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the floating device for reducing the magnitude of impact force on the pier here the time histories of impact force on the pier using the floating device and without using the floating device respectively are plotted in fig 13 for the two ships studied in this section the maximum impact force corresponding to the 52300 dwt ship reduces from 139 7 mn to 78 4 mn and the maximum impact force corresponding to the 50000 dwt ship reduces from 99 1 mn to 84 18 mn results indicate that the floating device is effective for reducing the maximum impact force on the pier and such force reduction is very considerable when the ship can be turned after impact the floating device is therefore effective as well for pier protection 4 2 stiffness of outer periphery the studies in the previous section have shown that the navigation direction of the 50000 dwt fully loaded ship with an impact velocity of 4 m s and impact angle of 0 cannot be turned after impact due to the serious damage to the outer steel periphery after impact one measure to enhance the ability of the floating device to turn the navigation direction of the ship would be to increase the stiffness of the outer periphery so that it would undergo small deformations during impact and consequently the outline of the outer periphery would be able to turn the ship to confirm this idea the outer periphery of the device is modeled using rigid material model mat rigid so that the periphery undergoes no deformation at all during impact fig 14 shows the position and direction of the 50000 dwt fully loaded ship with an impact velocity of 4 m s and impact angle of 0 after impact when the outer periphery is rigid results show that the navigation direction of the 50000 dwt fully loaded ship is successfully turned by the device after impact this means that the stiffness of the outer periphery is influential upon the ability of the device to turn the ship after impact the energy transformation process during impact using rigid outer periphery is shown in fig 15 around 79 0 of the kinetic energy is carried off by the ship after impact whilst the rest of the kinetic energy is transformed into the internal energy of the ship bow 4 3 existence of the steel wire rope coils the 52300 dwt fully loaded ship with an impact velocity of 4 m s and impact angle of 0 is used to evaluate the influence of the steel wire rope coils upon the effectiveness of the floating device the studies in sec 4 1 have shown that the floating device is able to turn the navigation direction of this ship after impact for comparison purposes another simulation is conducted where only the outer steel periphery remains whilst all the steel wire rope coils and other components of the floating device are deleted the position and direction of the 52300 dwt fully loaded ship and the damage to the outer steel periphery for this impact scenario are shown in fig 16 it is shown that without the steel wire rope coils the outer steel periphery is still able to turn the navigation direction of the ship after impact as the outline of the periphery still allows the ship to slide along after impact the internal energy absorbed by each impacting or impacted member after impact is tabulated in table 7 the results tabulated in tables 5 and 7 show that without the steel wire rope coils the internal energy absorbed by the ship bow after impact increases from 5 8 mj to 31 66 mj and the internal energy absorbed by the outer steel periphery after impact increases from 215 61 mj to 310 64 mj the steel wire rope coils can considerably reduce the amount of internal energy absorbed by the ship and the outer steel periphery and are therefore effective for protecting both the ship and the outer steel periphery in addition the maximum impact force on the pier can be greatly reduced from 120 54 mn to 78 40 mn when the steel wire rope coils are used as shown in fig 17 4 4 impact energy the studies in sec 4 1 have shown that the 50000 dwt fully loaded ship with an impact velocity of 4 m s and impact angle of 0 cannot be turned by the floating device after impact to check the effect of impact energy on the ability of the device to turn the ship after impact the displacement of the ship is adjusted to 6710 ton by changing only the mass density of the material in the ship hull whilst the impact velocity and impact angle keep unchanged in this way the impact energy of the ship is reduced the position and direction of the ship after impact is shown in fig 18 which shows that the ship can be successfully turned by the floating device after impact the outer periphery undergoes merely small deformations after impact and therefore the outline of the outer periphery allows the ship to slide along until the ship is turned the energy transformation process during impact is shown in fig 19 around 36 6 of the kinetic energy is carried off by the ship after impact whilst the rest of the kinetic energy is transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device 5 summary and conclusions this paper evaluated the effectiveness of the flexible floating device adopted by zhanjiang bay bridge for three ships i e 52300 dwt 50000 dwt and 5000 dwt using finite element simulations the mechanical properties of the ships were represented by detailed finite element models using shell elements the steel structural members of the floating device i e the outer the middle and the inner floating steel periphery and the steel wire rope coils were carefully modeled with validations using experimental data the validated finite element models were then used to predict the dynamic ship impact processes the studies show that the floating device is able to change the navigation direction of the ship during impact given that the outer floating steel periphery does not undergo overly large plastic deformations the ship impact energy the stiffness of the ship bow and the stiffness of the outer floating steel periphery have a significant influence upon the effectiveness of the floating device for changing the navigation direction of the ship during impact due to high impact energy or large stiffness of the ship bow the outer floating steel periphery could undergo dramatic plastic deformations and hence the ship gets stuck by the device and cannot be turned away when such case occurs most of the impact energy is transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device however when the stiffness of the ship bow or the impact energy is not that much large the impacting ship could be turned away by the device as the outer periphery does not undergo overly large plastic deformations when the ship can be turned away a large amount of impact energy remains as the residual kinetic energy of the ship after impact and thus the amount of internal energy absorbed by the ship and the device can be reduced resulting in the protection of both the ship and the floating device increasing the stiffness of the outer steel periphery is useful for enhancing the effectiveness of the device for changing the navigation direction of the ship during impact and can consequently reduce the damage to the floating device the studies indicate that the outer floating steel periphery and the steel wire rope coils absorb a large portion of internal energy whilst the ship bow absorbs only a small portion of internal energy after impact thus the device is effective for protecting the ship during impact the maximum impact force on the protected bridge pier can be reduced by a certain amount when the floating device is used and should the ship be turned away during impact the force reduction becomes even more prominent thus the bridge pier can be protected by the floating device as well the steel wire rope coils do play an important role in the effectiveness of the floating device as they absorb a large amount of internal energy during impact and the damages to both the ship and the outer steel periphery can be alleviated in addition to that the maximum impact force on the protected bridge pier can be reduced by introducing the coils alleviating the damage to the bridge pier during impact acknowledgements the authors wish to thank

22908,ship impact is a potential hazard for bridge piers located in navigation waterways to avoid direct contact between the ship and the pier protective structures of different types are currently widely used in bridge designs against ship impact as one of these protective structures the flexible floating device has drawn much attention in recent years the main advantage of this device lies in its low cost and its ability to float on water surface regardless of water elevation this paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a flexible floating anti collision device adopted in the zhanjiang bay bridge located in guangdong province china using finite element models detailed illustrations of the structural configurations are provided in addition finite element models of the ship and the floating device with calibrations using experimental data are developed the influences of several factors upon the ability of the device to turn the navigation direction of the ship the energy dissipation capacity of the device and the effectiveness of the device for reducing the impact force on the pier are thoroughly evaluated using the validated finite element models keywords ship impact protective structures floating device finite element models experimental data 1 introduction with the rapid growth of trade and the remarkable advancement of modern science and technology a large number of bridges spanning over navigation waterways have been built during the last decade these bridge piers located in navigation waterways are very susceptible to ship impact due to the increase of ship transportation volume it was pointed out by manen and frandsen manen et al 1998 and larsen 1993 previously that at least one major vessel bridge collision accident of serious consequences occurred each year on average in the past such collisions can often lead to catastrophic consequences including human casualties and economic losses thus direct contact between the ship and the pier should be avoided pier protection from ship collision has led to substantial scientific investigations in the past decade sha and hao 2015 saul et al 2001 morgenthal and saul 2005 knott 1986 simonsen and ottesen hansen 1998 svensson 2009 wang et al 2008 wang and morgenthal 2018a protective structures such as dolphin structures saul et al 2001 morgenthal and saul 2005 knott 1986 artificial islands simonsen and ottesen hansen 1998 and guiding structures svensson 2009 are currently extensively used in bridge designs against ship impact however those structures often suffer from problems such as high cost great construction difficulties and the inability to float on water surface another technique is to strengthen the pier itself using carbon fibre reinforced polymers cfrp sha and hao 2015 such strengthening technique can improve the pier resistance for ship impact however it cannot reduce the maximum impact force thus it is effective for pier protection but not for ship protection sha and hao 2015 during a ship collision a portion of impact energy is transformed into the residual kinetic energy of the ship whilst the rest of impact energy is dissipated through plastic deformations of the ship and the impacted structure in order to protect a bridge pier from ship impact and avoid large plastic deformations of the ship under different water elevations it is necessary to devise a crashworthy device that can float on water surface and can absorb a large portion of impact energy in this way the amount of energy absorbed by the pier and the ship during impact can be much reduced so that both the pier and the ship can be protected based on this concept flexible floating anti collision devices comprised of steel and rubber have been developed and frequently used in china for bridges such as the yangtze river highway bridge located in hubei province china chen 2017 the zhanjiang bay bridge located in guangdong province china chen and wang 2006 the xiangshan bridge located in zhejiang province china lv et al 2014 etc such devices are often used in locations where the water elevation experiences dramatic changes during the year no connection components between the device and the pier are needed thus the installation difficulties can be much reduced during a ship collision the floating device can keep the pier from direct contact with the ship and can absorb a large amount of impact energy through plastic deformations leading to a reduction of impact force transmitted to the pier in addition the outline of the device can be designed to turn the navigation direction of the ship during impact and consequently the amount of energy absorbed by the ship and the device can be reduced chen et al chen and wang 2006 devised a flexible floating device which was installed on zhan jiang bay bridge located in guangdong province china this device is comprised of a series of steel wire rope coils connected in parallel between one outer and one inner floating steel periphery wang et al 2008 have numerically analyzed the mechanical properties of this device using one single ship model however the steel wire rope coils are represented by a uni axial nonlinear viscoelastic model which could be insufficient as in reality it s unlikely that all coils deform in one single direction during impact in addition only one type of ship is used for the analysis whilst ships of different tonnages bow configurations etc are employed in navigation this paper thus aims to develop reliable finite element models of several different types of ships and the floating device emphasizing on the steel wire rope coils with calibrations using experimental data and use such finite element models to investigate the effectiveness of the device for turning the navigation direction of ships the energy dissipation capacity of the device and the effectiveness of the device for reducing the impact force on the pier 2 configuration of the device the flexible floating device studied here is comprised of four parts i e the outer floating steel periphery the middle steel periphery the inner floating steel periphery and a series of flexible steel wire rope coils connecting the three steel peripheries as shown in detail in fig 1 the device surrounds the bridge pier which is to be protected from ship impact each steel wire rope coil is wrapped by the rubber from outside during a ship collision the coils are able to dissipate the impact energy through plastic deformations and heat generation by friction between steel wires the particular geometric outline of the outer floating steel periphery is also expected to be capable of changing the navigation direction of the ship during impact reducing the amount of impact energy that needs to be dissipated through plastic deformations of the ship and the protective device 3 finite element models finite element simulations have been currently extensively used for dynamic analysis of impact scenarios such as barge pier impact sha and hao 2013 yuan 2005 wang and morgenthal 2017 2018b barge floodwall impact getter et al 2015 ship iceberg impact liu et al 2011 gao et al 2015 ship ship impact yagi et al 2009 ship impact with oil rigs travanca and hao 2015 etc to conduct such simulations reliable finite element models of the impacting ship and the impacted structure are needed in this section the finite element models of ships and flexible floating device and model validations using data from experimental impact tests are presented 3 1 finite element models of the ships the main pylon of zhanjiang bay bridge is designed to resist the impact from a 50000 dwt ship chen 2017 here three ships of 52300 dwt 50000 dwt and 5000 dwt respectively are selected to investigate the effectiveness of the flexible floating device for different types of ships the fully loaded displacements of the three ships are 68000 ton 62000 ton and 6710 ton respectively the detailed drawings of the ships are used for developing the finite element models the corresponding parameters regarding the ships are available in refs wang et al 2008 2012 chen 2017 each ship is divided into two zones namely the ship bow and the ship hull respectively previous studies fan and yuan 2014 chen 2006 have indicated that during a high energy ship collision the ship bow generally experiences dramatic plastic deformations whilst the ship hull undergoes only small elastic deformations for this reason the ship bows are modeled using fine meshes whilst the ship hulls are modeled using course meshes for simplification purposes all ships are modeled entirely using shell elements totaling 29137 159225 and 61320 for 52300 dwt 50000 dwt and 5000 dwt ships respectively the finite element models of the three ships are presented in fig 2 including the detailed modelings of the ship bows the ship bows are modeled using shell elements with consideration of material plasticity the engineering stress strain curves of the steel used here were obtained from tensile tests and the true stress strain curves are generated by the following equations paik 2006 1 σ t f ε e σ e 1 ε e 2 ε t ln 1 ε e where ε e is the engineering strain σ e is the engineering stress ε t is the true strain σ t is the true stress and f ε e is the knock down factor function described in detail as per ref paik 2006 eq 1 and eq 2 were proved to be the most appropriate to model the stress versus strain characteristics of steel paik 2006 2007 the true stress strain curves of the steel used in this study are plotted in fig 3 for saving the computational cost the bi linear elastoplastic material model mat plastic kinematic is adopted here for the steel within the ship bows as demonstrated in fig 3 the related material parameters regarding the steel are tabulated in table 1 fig 3 shows that the bi linear curves match well with the corresponding true stress strain curves within the measured strain range the ship hulls are modeled using rigid material model mat rigid for saving the computational cost 3 2 finite element model of the floating device to predict the deformation processes of the flexible floating device subjected to ship impact with sufficient accuracy it is important to generate a numerical model that can represent the main mechanical features of the device in a reasonable way here the members of the floating device are modeled based on their true configurations from the drawings as depicted in fig 4 6 where the steel structural members i e the outer the middle and the inner floating steel periphery are modeled using shell elements with bi linear elastoplastic material model mat plastic kinematic the true stress strain curve and the bi linear curve of the structural steel used in the device are plotted in fig 3 and the related material parameters regarding the steel are tabulated in table 2 after careful convergence tests the steel structural members of the device are meshed using 496910 shell elements with minimum and maximum mesh size of 50 mm and 300 mm respectively it is noteworthy that the technique adopted here for modeling the steel structural members subjected to impact loading has been validated using experimental data generated by a series of drop hammer impact tests on scaled steel boxes conducted by wang et al wang et al 2018 it is noteworthy that using the bi linear elastoplastic material model instead of the true stress strain curves for the structural steel of the ship and the floating device won t change the relative strength between the ship and the device markedly and consequently the energy dissipation process during impact is not expected to be obviously influenced nevertheless the absolute values of some related results e g duration and peak of impact forces could be slightly influenced however the main objective of this study is to investigate the overall effectiveness of the proposed floating device for pier protection from barge impact the slight difference in duration and peak of impact forces introduced by using the bi linear stress strain curves is considered insignificant and is thus ignored in this study the steel wire rope coil used in the floating device shows some non linear viscoelastic properties based on the experimental impact test conducted by chen and wang 2006 as shown in fig 7 where the axial loading and unloading force displacement curve of the coil is obtained through the compressive impact loading generated by a drop hammer weighing 6000 kg with an impact velocity of 4 m s as it is required by the harbour administration that the travelling velocity of the ship should not exceed 4 m s when crossing the bridge fig 7 shows that the force increases slowly when the axial displacement of the coil is less than 350 mm however when the axial displacement exceeds 350 mm the force starts to increase rapidly until the unloading stage the area of the plane 32 434 kj within the hysteresis loop after one loading and unloading cycle represents the amount of energy dissipated by the coil during impact results indicate the ideal energy dissipation capacity of the coil subjected to impact loading enabling the floating device to dissipate a large amount of energy during impact the finite element model of the steel wire rope coil subjected to impact loading as shown in fig 8 is developed with model validation using the experimental results presented above other than using single spring models to represent the axial resistance of each coil as demonstrated in refs wang et al 2008 zhao et al 2014 this study models the coil using solid elements totaling 530 for each coil to better reflect the complex mechanical behaviour of the coil during impact mat viscoelastic is used to model the non linear viscoelastic properties of the coil this material model is easy to use as only five parameters i e mass density elastic bulk modulus short time shear modulus long time shear modulus and decay constant need to be specified detailed introduction of this material model is provided by ref hallquist 2003 the values of these five parameters as tabulated in table 3 are determined in such a way that the numerical simulation results i e peak impact force maximum displacement and dissipated amount of energy match those obtained from the experimental impact test with sufficient accuracy as provided in table 4 which shows that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results the loading and unloading curve of the coil generated by the finite element model also shows a good agreement with that obtained from the experimental impact test as shown in fig 9 3 3 finite element model of the bridge pier as the objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of the flexible floating device the complex deformation processes of the bridge pier during impact is not considered and thus the pier is assumed to be rigid the pier is entirely modeled using solid elements with rigid material model mat rigid automatic surface to surface contact is used to define the contact between the ship and the impacted structure whilst automatic single surface contact is used to define the contact among the members inside the ship or the floating device chen 2017 wang et al 2012 4 case studies previous studies wang et al 2008 have shown that when the ship can be turned away from its original navigation direction most of the initial kinetic energy remains on the ship and consequently the ship the device and the pier can all be protected however when the ship cannot be turned away during impact most of the impact energy will be transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device the ability of the device to turn the ship away during impact is thus critical for the protection of the ship the device and the pier in this section the influence of several factors i e the stiffness of ship bow the stiffness of the outer periphery of the device the existence of the steel wire rope coils and ship impact energy upon the ability of the device to turn the ship away during impact is thoroughly investigated in addition the energy dissipation capacity of the device and the effectiveness of the device for reducing the impact force on the protected bridge pier are also evaluated in this section here the assumed impact position on the device is shown in fig 10 where the impact velocity v 0 and impact angle θ are also illustrated it should be noted that the impact scenarios considered here are actually ideal cases where the complex hydrodynamic effects from the surrounding water are not included in current simulations for simplification purposes the ship is assumed to be moving in a straight line without yawing before it touches the impacted structure such ideal impact scenarios may deviate from the realistic cases however the objective of this paper is to investigate the mechanical properties of the protective device

when the device is impacted by the 50000 dwt fully loaded ship which cannot be turned after impact most around 87 1 of the kinetic energy is transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device resulting in serious damages to the outer steel periphery as fig 11 shows the amount of internal energy absorbed by each of the impacting or impacted member and the corresponding ratio to the

ship after impact as the outline of the periphery still allows the ship to slide along after impact the internal energy absorbed by each impacting or impacted member after impact is tabulated in table 7 the results tabulated in tables 5 and 7 show that without the steel wire rope coils the internal energy absorbed by the ship bow after impact increases from 5 8 mj to 31 66 mj and the internal energy absorbed by the outer steel periphery after impact increases from 215 61 mj to 310 64 mj the steel wire rope coils can considerably reduce the amount of internal energy absorbed by the ship and the outer steel periphery and are therefore effective for protecting both the ship and the outer steel periphery in addition the maximum impact force on the pier can be greatly reduced from 120 54 mn to 78 40 mn when the steel wire rope coils are used as shown in fig 17 4 4 impact energy the studies in sec 4 1 have shown that the 50000 dwt fully loaded ship with an impact velocity of 4 m s and impact angle of 0 cannot be turned by the floating device after impact to check the effect of impact energy on the ability of the device to turn the ship after impact the displacement of the ship is adjusted to 6710 ton by changing only the mass density of the material in the ship hull whilst the impact velocity and impact angle keep unchanged in this way the impact energy of the ship is reduced the position and direction of the ship after impact is shown in fig 18 which shows that the ship can be successfully turned by the floating device after impact the outer periphery undergoes merely small deformations after impact and therefore the outline of the outer periphery allows the ship to slide along until the ship is turned the energy transformation process during impact is shown in fig 19 around 36 6 of the kinetic energy is carried off by the ship after impact whilst the rest of the kinetic energy is transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device 5 summary and conclusions this paper evaluated the effectiveness of the flexible floating device adopted by zhanjiang bay bridge for three ships i e 52300 dwt 50000 dwt and 5000 dwt using finite element simulations the mechanical properties of the ships were represented by detailed finite element models using shell elements the steel structural members of the floating device i e the outer the middle and the inner floating steel periphery and the steel wire rope coils were carefully modeled with validations using experimental data the validated finite element models were then used to predict the dynamic ship impact processes the studies show that the floating device is able to change the navigation direction of the ship during impact given that the outer floating steel periphery does not undergo overly large plastic deformations the ship impact energy the stiffness of the ship bow and the stiffness of the outer floating steel periphery have a significant influence upon the effectiveness of the floating device for changing the navigation direction of the ship during impact due to high impact energy or large stiffness of the ship bow the outer floating steel periphery could undergo dramatic plastic deformations and hence the ship gets stuck by the device and cannot be turned away when such case occurs most of the impact energy is transformed into the internal energy of the ship and the device however when the stiffness of the ship bow or the impact energy is not that much large the impacting ship could be turned away by the device as the outer periphery does not undergo overly large plastic deformations when the ship can be turned away a large amount of impact energy remains as the residual kinetic energy of the ship after impact and thus the amount of internal energy absorbed by the ship and the device can be reduced resulting in the protection of both the ship and the floating device increasing the stiffness of the outer steel periphery is useful for enhancing the effectiveness of the device for changing the navigation direction of the ship during impact and can consequently reduce the damage to the floating device the studies indicate that the outer floating steel periphery and the steel wire rope coils absorb a large portion of internal energy whilst the ship bow absorbs only a small portion of internal energy after impact thus the device is effective for protecting the ship during impact the maximum impact force on the protected bridge pier can be reduced by a certain amount when the floating device is used and should the ship be turned away during impact the force reduction becomes even more prominent thus the bridge pier can be protected by the floating device as well the steel wire rope coils do play an important role in the effectiveness of the floating device as they absorb a large amount of internal energy during impact and the damages to both the ship and the outer steel periphery can be alleviated in addition to that the maximum impact force on the protected bridge pier can be reduced by introducing the coils alleviating the damage to the bridge pier during impact acknowledgements the authors wish to thank

22909,the ochi hubble spectrum model is a six parameter spectrum proposed for sea states consisting of swell and wind sea components this paper modifies this model and analyzes them using two series of measurement dataset in the gulf of oman during 2006 2007 and 2016 to represent its double peaked spectra double peaked spectra of the 2016 dataset were recorded at seven stations and then were categorized into two groups based on the dominance of swell or wind sea components each including five classes based on the significant wave height in the meantime values of six parameters of the ochi hubble model were extracted from field dataset then a comprehensive statistical analysis was performed based on the occurrence probability of spectra resulting in a modified family of ochi hubble spectra such spectra were compared to two spectra recently calibrated for the region moreover the model was compared with the 2006 2007 dataset to assess its performance over time based on the aforementioned comprehensive evaluations and extensive field measurements this modified model describes double peaked spectra of the region better than previously suggested ones keywords double peaked spectrum ochi hubble spectral model torsethaugen spectral model gulf of oman 1 introduction sea wave spectra play a vital role in the design of coastal and offshore structures most of the available studies have concentrated on analyzing the wave spectra generated by local wind due to its simplicity as well as inadequacy of measurements however simultaneous presence of swell and local wind almost always changes the model of wave spectrum affecting offshore structures design sea keeping safety ship passages over harbor entrance or even surf forecasting earle 1984 ochi and hubble 1977 developed a series of double peaked wave spectra involving six parameters in development of the series they divided observed spectra into low frequency and high frequency components then such components were expressed with a gamma function a mathematical description capable of adjusting well to datasets afterwards these components were combined to present the final double peaked spectrum the idea of combining two components was proposed earlier by strekalov et al 1973 ochi and hubble 1977 calculated the value of each parameter in terms of the significant wave height using a statistical analysis over 800 observed spectra across the north atlantic ocean they presented a family of spectra that are expected to occur within 95 confidence interval guedes soares 1984 proposed a four parameter theoretical formulation to represent double peaked spectrum he combined two jonswap spectra and provided an excellent fit to 1000 measured wave spectra from north atlantic ocean and 6000 wave spectra from north sea by reducing the number of parameters originally included in the jonswap model from 5 to 2 he was able to propose a simple model of the double peaked spectrum the main assumption of his work was that the swell component is properly modeled by the jonswap spectrum as well as the wind sea component the justification was that the swell system should have some similarities with wind sea system as it starts from a wind sea system that then propagates without the effect of the wind this was in line with early findings of goda 1983 which were recently confirmed by lucas and guedes soares 2015 so in view of the limited number of measured double peaked spectra available at the time guedes soares 1984 proposed a simple model of the double peaked spectrum based on four parameters the proposed four parameter model was later applied to a larger dataset of spectra from portugal by guedes soares and nolasco 1992 and the parameters were determined for each combination of significant wave height h s and zero crossing period t z these two parameters of the double peaked spectrum were indicated in scatter diagrams of a given geographical area torsethaugen 1993 combined two original jonswap spectra with 5 parameters each to model extensive measurements of sea waves at the statfjord field in norwegian waters he introduced a criterion to distinguish between swell dominated and wind dominated spectra later torsethaugen 2004 simplified his model by reducing free parameters similar to the idea of guedes soares 1984 moon and oh 1998 compared pierson moskowitz jonswap and tma models to find the best fit for seas around korea in their study tma showed the best agreement with measured data in most cases however it could not represent double peaked spectra in several cases in order to resolve this issue they used the ochi and hubble 1977 statistical analysis to present a newly developed tma spectrum it should be reminded that the tma spectrum is a finite water depth model while the other two are deep water models besides the pierson moskowitz spectrum could be considered as a particular case of the jonswap spectrum chakrabarti 1987 this is also the case for the tma spectrum obtained from a jonswap spectrum specified in deep water and then transformed to shallow water undertaking shoaling and refraction processes guedes soares and caires 1995 so despite issues like the shape of the tail of the spectrum the jonswap continues to be a generally accepted model over the years phillips 1985 prevosto et al 1996 rodriguez and guedes soares 1999 rodriguez et al 1999 infrastructure development is planned for the northern coast of the gulf of oman as its geographical location is favorable for maritime trading panahi et al 2017 therefore port and maritime organization of iran conducted a field measurement in 2016 after measurements in 2006 2007 panahi et al 2015 double peaked spectra usually appear in the gulf of oman considering the simultaneous presence of swell and wind sea waves especially during monsoon seasons rashmi et al 2012 however few studies have been performed to investigate double peaked spectra in the region panahi et al 2015 worked on directional wave spectra of the region using the separation frequency implemented sfi approach which is a novel calibration procedure panahi et al 2016 compared non directional observed spectra in the region to the ochi hubble and torsethaugen models they calibrated both models and concluded that torsethaugen model is superior in calibrations the disadvantage of torsethaugen is its intrinsic complexity both aforementioned studies were based on 2006 2007 dataset this raised the question of whether changing the calibration method can improve the performance of the ochi hubble model which is occurrence probability based to be comparable to already tested models by panahi et al 2016 the ochi hubble model has a more straightforward formulation than torsethaugen model which was another motivation to improve it having access to 2016 dataset the performance of such a modified model can be verified over time as well i e modification based on 2016 dataset and verification by 2006 2007 dataset and those calibrated based on it it should be noticed that the ochi hubble model has six parameters that have been originally calibrated based on the north atlantic ocean low to high sea states where significant wave height varies between 1 22m and 13 72m on the contrary the gulf of oman usually has a low to moderate sea states to the extent that its significant wave heights rarely exceed 3m saket and etemad shahidi 2012 therefore this study aims to modify parameters of the ochi hubble model based on 2016 dataset using its standard statistical analysis and borrowing some ideas from torsethaugen 1993 the study also benefits from access to 2007 data in the region as well as two calibrated spectral models based on such measurements panahi et al 2016 to this end section 2 introduces the study area and section 3 overviews the used spectral models in this study the process of data preparation is explained in section 4 section 5 clarifies all statistical analysis applied on the prepared dataset to modify the ochi hubble model the penultimate section presents the results in which performance of modified the ochi hubble is investigated against 2007 dataset and available calibrated spectral models conclusions can be found in section 7 2 local measurements in 2016 wave data were collected from seven stations located in the northern parts of the gulf of oman using nortek acoustic wave and current profiler awac awac 2018 the number of samples directly affecting the accuracy of the spectrum was 1024 samples per averaging interval the wave sampling rate was 1 hz the wave interval was 3600s and the number of wave samples was 1024 in awac device considering depths wave characteristics and available memory table 1 represents characteristics of measurement stations measurement stations are marked in fig 1 along with stations investigated in 2007 it is evident that new measurements cover a wider area which is more than 210 km wide the previous measurement area was less than 15 km in width such data were used to modify a new family of ochi hubble spectra after running data preparation the area called chabahar bay was also investigated earlier in 2007 by three other measurement stations around 25 20 53 n and 60 30 40 e in dms degrees minutes seconds panahi et al 2016 the area became important at the time due to port development projects in the bay after releasing the data they were investigated by panahi et al 2016 their results together with their implemented dataset are examined to assess performance of results of this study in section 6 3 spectral models used in this study as mentioned earlier ochi hubble and torsethaugen models already have been calibrated for the region by panahi et al 2016 based on 2007 dataset later such calibrated versions were used to check results of this study as presented in section 6 as this study focuses on the modification of the ochi hubble model it should be noted that the model has been frequently used in the literature to investigate performance of spectral models e g torsethaugen 1993 and torsethaugen 2004 besides the ochi hubble model is proposed by many offshore structures design rules and recommended practices e g dnvgl rp c205 dnvgl 2014 which suggests just two double peaked spectra ochi hubble and torsethaugen 1993 moreover the ochi hubble model is among those spectra implemented in several software e g orcaflex 2018 flexcom 2018 wafo wafo 2018 maxsurf 2018 etc 3 1 ochi hubble model ochi and hubble 1977 presented a double peaked spectrum as a combination of two gamma distributions as follow 1 s ω 1 4 j 4 λ j 1 4 ω p j 4 λ j г λ j h s j 2 ω 4 λ j 1 exp 4 λ j 1 4 ω p j ω 4 where h s j ω p j and λ j for j 1 2 are significant wave height angular peak frequency and spectral shape factor for low and high frequency parts known as swell and wind sea components respectively then they carried out statistical analysis for six above mentioned parameters to develop 11 spectra for a given sea severity marked by total h s this family of spectra represent the most probable spectrum and those spectra expected to occur with 95 confidence formulation of the six parameters is given below for j 1 2 2 h 1 r p 1 h s 3 h 2 1 r p 1 2 h s 4 ω p j a j exp b j h s 5 λ j c j exp d j h s this basic form was then calibrated by panahi et al 2016 based on 2007 dataset of the gulf of oman measurements to yield a design wave spectrum they calibrated the spectrum over the whole field by minimizing the root mean square error rmse and relative area under the spectrum δ a a using a nonlinear generalized reduced gradient ngrg algorithm lasdon et al 1974 parameters of the calibrated model based on 2006 2007 dataset can be found panahi et al 2016 3 2 torsethaugen model torsethaugen spectral model 2004 is based on five parameters including h s t p γ m and n all of them are expressed in terms of h s total significant wave height and t p the period at which the double peaked spectrum has its highest value or peak period therefore it has one more input in comparison to the ochi hubble model the spectrum is similarly a sum of wind sea and swell components for j 1 2 as below torsethaugen 2004 6 s f j 1 2 e j s n j f n j where 7 f n j f t p j 8 e j 1 16 h j 2 t p j 9 s j n f j n g 0 a γ f j n 4 exp f j n 4 γ exp 1 2 σ 2 f j n 1 2 other parameters are as shown below 10 g 0 3 26 11 σ 0 07 f n 1 0 09 f n 1 12 a γ 1 1 1 ln γ 1 19 γ torsethaugen 2004 categorizes spectra into swell dominated and wind dominated groups based on the following criterion 13 t p f a f h s 1 3 where t p f is the spectral peak period for fully developed wind sea besides a f is a fetch dependent duration factor for long fetches a f 6 6 can be applied based on this criterion for t p t p f the spectrum is wind dominated and for t p t p f it is a swell dominated one panahi et al 2016 calibrated this model for the region using sfi method the calibration procedure and all the related parameters based on 2007 dataset can be found in panahi et al 2016 work 4 data preparation at this stage all the required inputs for the required statistical analysis to modify the ochi hubble model were prepared fig 2 statistical analysis involved pre processing of the raw data using storm v1 14 software storm 2018 and then selection of representative double peaked events two parallel procedures were started following the left side of fig 2 representative events were categorized based on their total significant wave height as well as dominance of swell or wind sea system using the criterion introduced by torsethaugen 1993 additionally such events were separated into swell and wind sea components using the criterion introduced by guedes soares 1984 then all the required parameters for the ochi hubble model were quantified right side of fig 2 4 1 data pre processing in order to calculate wave parameters storm v1 14 was used it is a graphical wave and current profile data processing software in which suv technology a nortek s patented wave data collection and processing technique pedersen et al 2005 is implemented this software generates non directional wave spectrum by three methods pressure based velocity based and acoustic surface tracking ast considering software recommendations ast method is the most suitable one for awac devices hence optimized option was activated in the software by which ast is used as the primary means for wave energy spectrum extraction if the software deems that ast results have more than 10 outliers then it would automatically revert to the pressure method in depths less than 20m or the velocity method in depths greater than 20m a smoothing value of 128 was considered appropriate as the highest possible value the smoothing value specifies how many fft bins are used at each frequency the greater the number of bins the smoother the spectra appears conversely lower number of bins results in spikier spectra the smoothing value does not change the total energy but may slightly change the distribution of energy in addition an end frequency of 0 5 hz is selected based on the suggestions of a previous work panahi et al 2016 all settings are presented in table 2 4 2 selection of double peaked spectra after pre processing a reasonable number of the double peaked spectra was selected all the peaks within the time history of measurements with a significant wave height greater than 0 9m were extracted see fig 3 for clarification this preliminary criterion resulted in 3256 events peaks then these events were checked via criteria introduced by guedes soares 1984 to find out which one was a double peaked spectrum guedes soares 1984 suggests a minimum distance of 0 03 hz between peak frequencies of a double peaked spectrum besides the energy of a trough between two spectral peaks should be smaller than 90 of energy of each peak the criteria resulted in 911 double peaked spectra as representative events distributed over all the stations it is worth mentioning that the threshold of 0 9 m was based on previous studies in the region to gather enough number of representative events for the statistical analysis panahi et al 2016 4 3 categorization of spectra in this subsection categorization of representative events into two groups based on the dominance of swell or wind sea components is detailed then the division of each group into five classes based on the value of significant wave height is explained 4 3 1 two groups of spectra all the double peaked spectra were divided into swell dominated and wind dominated groups using torsethaugen 2004 criterion eq 13 this division originated from the assumption that spectra in the same group share similar characteristics the criterion worked well for the representative events as in a swell dominated spectrum the area under the swell part is greater than the area under the wind sea component and vice versa by applying the criterion to the events it was concluded that 62 of the representative events were swell dominated and the remaining 38 were wind dominated as summarized in table 3 4 3 2 five classes of spectra swell dominated and wind dominated groups were both classified into five classes based on their total significant wave height although the ochi hubble standard model offers ten classes in this study five classes were selected as summarized in table 4 the reason for the reduction in the number of classes was the smaller interval of significant wave height at the region under study statistical analysis was then applied on each class of both swell dominated and wind dominated groups representative h s in table 4 i e more or less the middle value of the class was used as an indicative value of each class for the following statistical analysis 4 4 extraction of required parameters as the last step of data preparation six parameters of ochi hubble spectral model were extracted this included separation of wind sea and swell components followed by the calculation of six parameters as described below 4 4 1 separation of wind sea and swell components of spectra after calculation of h m 0 and t p of all the double peaked spectra it was essential to divide each spectrum into its low frequency and high frequency components to evaluate six parameters of the ochi hubble spectrum available separation methods could be classified into one dimensional and two dimensional li and zhao 2012 one dimensional methods are more practical because they need neither wind vector nor wave direction additionally most of them are based on the introduction of a separation frequency f s to cut a double peaked spectrum into its two components li and zhao 2012 one of the latest methods proposed by hwang et al 2012 calculates the separation frequency using a spectrum integration method this method was used in this study as it was implemented earlier by panahi et al 2016 4 4 2 quantification of six parameters of the ochi hubble model six parameters of the ochi hubble model describing low frequency or swell j 1 and high frequency or wind sea j 2 components of the spectrum must be formulated based on their real value extracted from the dataset significant wave height was calculated for each component based on the zeroth moment of the wave spectrum m 0 as below sorensen 2005 14 h m 0 4 m 0 where m 0 denotes the area under the spectral curve benefiting from separation frequency hwang et al 2012 the share of swell and wind sea components under the spectral curve was quantified therefore h 1 and h 2 were calculated as below 15 h 1 4 m 0 s w e l l 16 h 2 4 m 0 w i n d also the following relationship holds ochi and hubble 1977 17 h 1 2 h 2 2 h s 2 peak frequencies of low and high frequency components f 1 and f 2 were easily quantified by a simple program sweeping representative events most challenging parameters were λ 1 and λ 2 in order to determine them already extracted values of h 1 h 2 f 1 f 2 were put into the standard ochi hubble formula eq 1 as constant parameters and two initial numbers were assumed for λ 1 and λ 2 firstly with λ 1 and λ 2 as variables the root mean square error between resulted ochi hubble model spectrum and observed spectrum was minimized to identify λ 1 and λ 2 then maximizing coefficient of determination was set as the target to obtain λ 1 and λ 2 it was observed that finding λ 1 and λ 2 based on minimization of rmse results in a better fit between observed spectra and resulted ochi hubble model in other words by minimizing the rmse a greater coefficient of determination closer to 1 was obtained while trying to reach higher coefficient of determination leads to significant increase in rmse nonlinear generalized reduced gradient algorithm was again used to find best λ 1 and λ 2 lasdon et al 1974 5 statistical analysis according to the ochi hubble model the final goal of statistical analysis is finding a concrete relation between total significant wave height of the event and six parameters of the model this effort leads to a family of spectra within 95 confidence limit therefore after data preparation stage explained in section 4 statistical analysis procedure began including four steps as illustrated in fig 4 the procedure was applied on all the five classes of both swell and wind dominated groups separately the analysis procedure was as follows start for a group one of the six parameters of the ochi hubble model e g h 1 was assigned as a target parameter tp step 1 probability density distribution pd of tp with the best fit to the data of each class was identified using minitab v16 2 4 five pds with respect to five classes for example fig 5 shows that h 1 in class s iii obeys a normal pd as the best estimation in comparison with other distributions step 2 based on the determined pds three values of tp were extracted as mode lower bound and upper bound of 95 confidence interval from each pd i e three values for each class for example consider fig 6 showing normal pd of h 1 along with mode lower and upper 95 bound values of h 1 in class s iii i e 0 72m 0 42m and 1 03m respectively then considering three series mode lower and upper bounds of five classes relation between tp and representative h s was drawn for instance fig 7 a shows that for a swell dominated group step 3 corresponding values of other five parameters associated with three extracted values of tp at each class were determined to draw diagrams just like fig 7 a to clarify this step consider h 1 and its mode value in class s iii equal to 0 72m its 5 values were 0 68m and 0 76m in order to find the value of f 1 associated to mode value of h 1 average of f 1 coincident with h 1 between 0 68m and 0 76m in s iii was determined this was equal to 0 082 hz hence f 1 value associated with h 1 mode value in class s iii spectra was found finally by applying the procedure on all remaining five parameters of ochi hubble model associated with tp e g h 1 including three modal values in five classes for swell dominated group fig 7 b 7 f were obtained modified spectra after running the procedure for the first time over swell dominated group of spectra three sets of the modified ochi hubble model were extracted with respect to the first tp one of them represents spectra with respect to mode values and two others give it for 95 confidence the procedure was continued by setting the next parameter in the list of six parameters of ochi hubble model as tp and starting again e g on swell dominated group it is worth noting that fig 7 is just associated with a specific tp here in the swell dominated group and leads to three sets of relations i e three spectra consequently by applying the same procedure on other parameters as tp eighteen spectra were derived including six sets associated with the mode value six sets associated with the upper bound value and six sets associated with the lower bound value in the swell dominated group six spectra associated with the mode value of six tp behaved reasonably similar to each other as shown in fig 8 hence in order to simplify the model eighteen spectra were decreased to thirteen ones by considering the spectrum associated with the mode value of h 1 as the representative of the six spectra associated with mode value of six parameters 6 results and discussion in this section results are presented and discussed at first formulation and coefficients of the modified ochi hubble model is elaborated on then performance comparison of the modified model with previous calibrated models for the region panahi et al 2016 is provided finally the modified model performance assessment based on 2006 2007 dataset is presented 6 1 modified ochi hubble model by carrying out the procedure described earlier in section 5 a family of 13 ochi hubble spectra for both swell and wind dominated groups was developed within 95 occurrence confidence interval basic forms for calculation of required six parameters in such spectra were as follow 18 h 1 a 1 exp b 1 h s 19 h 2 h s 2 h 1 2 20 f j c j exp d j h s 21 λ j e j exp f j h s table 5 shows value of the aforementioned coefficients in two groups these values are supposed to be used in eq 1 to represent the modified ochi hubble spectra 6 2 performance of modified ochi hubble spectra modified spectra were compared to standard ochi hubble model ochi and hubble 1977 to identify any improvement occurred through modification moreover two other spectra calibrated for the region i e those calibrated ochi hubble and calibrated torsethaugen models based on 2007 dataset by panahi et al 2016 were employed to evaluate performance of the modified ochi hubble against them over the 2016 dataset this evaluation is illustrated by figs 9 11 in three events each event is representative of a different condition swell dominated wind dominated and equal share of swell and wind sea apparently the modified model proposed in this study outperformed the other models as it followed the trend of observed spectrum shape more appropriately also it was more successful in finding the location of peaks i e peak frequencies however such qualitative assessments with respect to typical spectra are not able to demonstrate the general performance of the presented model the performance of all the spectra should be evaluated using suitable measures therefore the accuracy of model was investigated using average of three goodness of fit measures as below root mean square error rmse normalized difference of the area under the spectrum δa a and normalized difference of the peak frequency δf p f p table 6 shows average rmse δa a and δf p f p for each family of the standard ochi hubble model ochi and hubble 1977 calibrated ochi hubble and torsethaugen models panahi et al 2016 and the modified ochi hubble model current study results can be discussed from two points of view their rmse and δf p f p and δa a rmse and δf p f p show how exact the shape of modeled spectrum obeys the shape of corresponding observed spectrum in the meantime δa a shows the accuracy of estimated spectrum energy therefore these three measures were justified as minimum requirements to investigate the performance of the modified model as shown in table 6 the best performance of standard ochi hubble model belongs to the family no 9 the bold one with an rmse equal to 0 20 in addition rmse of calibrated ochi hubble and torsethaugen models are 0 18 and 0 17 respectively however lowest rmse of the modified ochi hubble model is 0 14 the bold one which belongs to family no 1 the most probable spectrum as it introduces the best performance when compared to other spectra standard ochi hubble model sometimes even failed to show two peaks of a spectrum so high rmse values are not surprising δf p f p of the modified ochi hubble model has improved generally in comparison with the other models it is worth mentioning that δf p f p of calibrated torsethaugen model is equal to 0 however it is not a great achievement because f p was directly inserted into this model was equal to its real field value there is no significant difference for δa a when comparing standard and the modified ochi hubble models however the modified model s δa a is considerably less than both previous calibrated models overall it seems that the modified model current study has a superior performance in comparison with the standard model and previous calibrated models according to all three evaluation measures rmse δf p f p and δa a 6 3 performance of the modified ochi hubble model based on previous data 2006 2007 dataset it is still a question that whether a spectrum localized based on measurement in a specific period is a good choice for that location over time or not this was examined in this study by comparing the performance of modified ochi hubble model calibrated based on 2016 dataset with representative events of 2007 here standard ochi hubble ochi and hubble 1977 and those calibrated ochi hubble and calibrated torsethaugen models based on 2007 dataset panahi et al 2016 also were included consequently an evaluation procedure similar to the previous subsection was conducted both qualitatively and quantitatively this is presented in figs 12 14 in which three distinct events are swell dominated wind dominated and equal share of swell and wind sea components similarly it seems that the modified model still acts as the superior model for a comprehensive analysis table 7 provides the evaluation measures rmse δf p f p and δa a for all the 2007 dataset goodness of fit measures reveal that family no 1 of the modified model again shows a better performance except for δf p f p which for the calibrated torsethaugen model is slightly it can be concluded that general performance of the modified ochi hubble still surpass the other models even using another dataset of the region 7 conclusion wave spectrum is an inseparable input of design procedures for coastal and offshore structures in case of concurrent presence of both swell and wind waves in a field wave spectra usually exhibit two peaks typically represented by double peaked spectral formula there are well known efforts to represent double peaked spectra e g ochi hubble 1977 guedes soares 1984 and torsethaugen 2004 there are also researches to localize such formula for specific times and spaces this study benefited from two extensive datasets at the gulf of oman i e 2016 dataset and 2006 2007 dataset to improve the ochi hubble 1977 model for this specific region based on flexibility of this model the original statistical analysis performed by ochi hubble 1977 was applied on 2016 dataset representative events i e selected double peaked spectra of the region were divided into swell dominated and wind dominated groups according to the criterion introduced by torsethaugen 2004 this resulted in developing a family of 13 spectra covering 95 confidence interval performance of the resulted modified model investigated against 2016 dataset as well as already calibrated spectra at the region based on 2007 dataset panahi et al 2016 performance of the modified model approved by three evaluation measures average value of root mean square error normalized difference of the area under the spectrum and normalized difference of the peak frequency these measures assess similarity of spectra in shape and their level of accuracy in order to investigate the performance of the modified model over time it examined against 2006 2007 dataset as well as already calibrated models at the region based on 2006 2007 dataset panahi et al 2016 similarly the modified model performed better that those calibrated based on 2007 dataset as this study is among the very limited research trying to discuss the issue of verification of spectra over time the avenue for future research is open a final remark should be made to bring the attention that this approach is fine as long as one is dealing with scalar or frequency spectra the physical reality is more complex because spectra varying in directions and sea states are only fully described by directional spectra as discussed by boukhanovsky and guedes soares 2009 lucas et al 2011 and panahi et al 2015 considering this complexity is another idea to work on in the future finally yet importantly as there are discussions on the form of swell and wind sea components of double peaked spectra it could offer a good idea to examine combination of different spectra at the region lucas and guedes soares 2015 
22909,the ochi hubble spectrum model is a six parameter spectrum proposed for sea states consisting of swell and wind sea components this paper modifies this model and analyzes them using two series of measurement dataset in the gulf of oman during 2006 2007 and 2016 to represent its double peaked spectra double peaked spectra of the 2016 dataset were recorded at seven stations and then were categorized into two groups based on the dominance of swell or wind sea components each including five classes based on the significant wave height in the meantime values of six parameters of the ochi hubble model were extracted from field dataset then a comprehensive statistical analysis was performed based on the occurrence probability of spectra resulting in a modified family of ochi hubble spectra such spectra were compared to two spectra recently calibrated for the region moreover the model was compared with the 2006 2007 dataset to assess its performance over time based on the aforementioned comprehensive evaluations and extensive field measurements this modified model describes double peaked spectra of the region better than previously suggested ones keywords double peaked spectrum ochi hubble spectral model torsethaugen spectral model gulf of oman 1 introduction sea wave spectra play a vital role in the design of coastal and offshore structures most of the available studies have concentrated on analyzing the wave spectra generated by local wind due to its simplicity as well as inadequacy of measurements however simultaneous presence of swell and local wind almost always changes the model of wave spectrum affecting offshore structures design sea keeping safety ship passages over harbor entrance or even surf forecasting earle 1984 ochi and hubble 1977 developed a series of double peaked wave spectra involving six parameters in development of the series they divided observed spectra into low frequency and high frequency components then such components were expressed with a gamma function a mathematical description capable of adjusting well to datasets afterwards these components were combined to present the final double peaked spectrum the idea of combining two components was proposed earlier by strekalov et al 1973 ochi and hubble 1977 calculated the value of each parameter in terms of the significant wave height using a statistical analysis over 800 observed spectra across the north atlantic ocean they presented a family of spectra that are expected to occur within 95 confidence interval guedes soares 1984 proposed a four parameter theoretical formulation to represent double peaked spectrum he combined two jonswap spectra and provided an excellent fit to 1000 measured wave spectra from north atlantic ocean and 6000 wave spectra from north sea by reducing the number of parameters originally included in the jonswap model from 5 to 2 he was able to propose a simple model of the double peaked spectrum the main assumption of his work was that the swell component is properly modeled by the jonswap spectrum as well as the wind sea component the justification was that the swell system should have some similarities with wind sea system as it starts from a wind sea system that then propagates without the effect of the wind this was in line with early findings of goda 1983 which were recently confirmed by lucas and guedes soares 2015 so in view of the limited number of measured double peaked spectra available at the time guedes soares 1984 proposed a simple model of the double peaked spectrum based on four parameters the proposed four parameter model was later applied to a larger dataset of spectra from portugal by guedes soares and nolasco 1992 and the parameters were determined for each combination of significant wave height h s and zero crossing period t z these two parameters of the double peaked spectrum were indicated in scatter diagrams of a given geographical area torsethaugen 1993 combined two original jonswap spectra with 5 parameters each to model extensive measurements of sea waves at the statfjord field in norwegian waters he introduced a criterion to distinguish between swell dominated and wind dominated spectra later torsethaugen 2004 simplified his model by reducing free parameters similar to the idea of guedes soares 1984 moon and oh 1998 compared pierson moskowitz jonswap and tma models to find the best fit for seas around korea in their study tma showed the best agreement with measured data in most cases however it could not represent double peaked spectra in several cases in order to resolve this issue they used the ochi and hubble 1977 statistical analysis to present a newly developed tma spectrum it should be reminded that the tma spectrum is a finite water depth model while the other two are deep water models besides the pierson moskowitz spectrum could be considered as a particular case of the jonswap spectrum chakrabarti 1987 this is also the case for the tma spectrum obtained from a jonswap spectrum specified in deep water and then transformed to shallow water undertaking shoaling and refraction processes guedes soares and caires 1995 so despite issues like the shape of the tail of the spectrum the jonswap continues to be a generally accepted model over the years phillips 1985 prevosto et al 1996 rodriguez and guedes soares 1999 rodriguez et al 1999 infrastructure development is planned for the northern coast of the gulf of oman as its geographical location is favorable for maritime trading panahi et al 2017 therefore port and maritime organization of iran conducted a field measurement in 2016 after measurements in 2006 2007 panahi et al 2015 double peaked spectra usually appear in the gulf of oman considering the simultaneous presence of swell and wind sea waves especially during monsoon seasons rashmi et al 2012 however few studies have been performed to investigate double peaked spectra in the region panahi et al 2015 worked on directional wave spectra of the region using the separation frequency implemented sfi approach which is a novel calibration procedure panahi et al 2016 compared non directional observed spectra in the region to the ochi hubble and torsethaugen models they calibrated both models and concluded that torsethaugen model is superior in calibrations the disadvantage of torsethaugen is its intrinsic complexity both aforementioned studies were based on 2006 2007 dataset this raised the question of whether changing the calibration method can improve the performance of the ochi hubble model which is occurrence probability based to be comparable to already tested models by panahi et al 2016 the ochi hubble model has a more straightforward formulation than torsethaugen model which was another motivation to improve it having access to 2016 dataset the performance of such a modified model can be verified over time as well i e modification based on 2016 dataset and verification by 2006 2007 dataset and those calibrated based on it it should be noticed that the ochi hubble model has six parameters that have been originally calibrated based on the north atlantic ocean low to high sea states where significant wave height varies between 1 22m and 13 72m on the contrary the gulf of oman usually has a low to moderate sea states to the extent that its significant wave heights rarely exceed 3m saket and etemad shahidi 2012 therefore this study aims to modify parameters of the ochi hubble model based on 2016 dataset using its standard statistical analysis and borrowing some ideas from torsethaugen 1993 the study also benefits from access to 2007 data in the region as well as two calibrated spectral models based on such measurements panahi et al 2016 to this end section 2 introduces the study area and section 3 overviews the used spectral models in this study the process of data preparation is explained in section 4 section 5 clarifies all statistical analysis applied on the prepared dataset to modify the ochi hubble model the penultimate section presents the results in which performance of modified the ochi hubble is investigated against 2007 dataset and available calibrated spectral models conclusions can be found in section 7 2 local measurements in 2016 wave data were collected from seven stations located in the northern parts of the gulf of oman using nortek acoustic wave and current profiler awac awac 2018 the number of samples directly affecting the accuracy of the spectrum was 1024 samples per averaging interval the wave sampling rate was 1 hz the wave interval was 3600s and the number of wave samples was 1024 in awac device considering depths wave characteristics and available memory table 1 represents characteristics of measurement stations measurement stations are marked in fig 1 along with stations investigated in 2007 it is evident that new measurements cover a wider area which is more than 210 km wide the previous measurement area was less than 15 km in width such data were used to modify a new family of ochi hubble spectra after running data preparation the area called chabahar bay was also investigated earlier in 2007 by three other measurement stations around 25 20 53 n and 60 30 40 e in dms degrees minutes seconds panahi et al 2016 the area became important at the time due to port development projects in the bay after releasing the data they were investigated by panahi et al 2016 their results together with their implemented dataset are examined to assess performance of results of this study in section 6 3 spectral models used in this study as mentioned earlier ochi hubble and torsethaugen models already have been calibrated for the region by panahi et al 2016 based on 2007 dataset later such calibrated versions were used to check results of this study as presented in section 6 as this study focuses on the modification of the ochi hubble model it should be noted that the model has been frequently used in the literature to investigate performance of spectral models e g torsethaugen 1993 and torsethaugen 2004 besides the ochi hubble model is proposed by many offshore structures design rules and recommended practices e g dnvgl rp c205 dnvgl 2014 which suggests just two double peaked spectra ochi hubble and torsethaugen 1993 moreover the ochi hubble model is among those spectra implemented in several software e g orcaflex 2018 flexcom 2018 wafo wafo 2018 maxsurf 2018 etc 3 1 ochi hubble model ochi and hubble 1977 presented a double peaked spectrum as a combination of two gamma distributions as follow 1 s ω 1 4 j 4 λ j 1 4 ω p j 4 λ j г λ j h s j 2 ω 4 λ j 1 exp 4 λ j 1 4 ω p j ω 4 where h s j ω p j and λ j for j 1 2 are significant wave height angular peak frequency and spectral shape factor for low and high frequency parts known as swell and wind sea components respectively then they carried out statistical analysis for six above mentioned parameters to develop 11 spectra for a given sea severity marked by total h s this family of spectra represent the most probable spectrum and those spectra expected to occur with 95 confidence formulation of the six parameters is given below for j 1 2 2 h 1 r p 1 h s 3 h 2 1 r p 1 2 h s 4 ω p j a j exp b j h s 5 λ j c j exp d j h s this basic form was then calibrated by panahi et al 2016 based on 2007 dataset of the gulf of oman measurements to yield a design wave spectrum they calibrated the spectrum over the whole field by minimizing the root mean square error rmse and relative area under the spectrum δ a a using a nonlinear generalized reduced gradient ngrg algorithm lasdon et al 1974 parameters of the calibrated model based on 2006 2007 dataset can be found panahi et al 2016 3 2 torsethaugen model torsethaugen spectral model 2004 is based on five parameters including h s t p γ m and n all of them are expressed in terms of h s total significant wave height and t p the period at which the double peaked spectrum has its highest value or peak period therefore it has one more input in comparison to the ochi hubble model the spectrum is similarly a sum of wind sea and swell components for j 1 2 as below torsethaugen 2004 6 s f j 1 2 e j s n j f n j where 7 f n j f t p j 8 e j 1 16 h j 2 t p j 9 s j n f j n g 0 a γ f j n 4 exp f j n 4 γ exp 1 2 σ 2 f j n 1 2 other parameters are as shown below 10 g 0 3 26 11 σ 0 07 f n 1 0 09 f n 1 12 a γ 1 1 1 ln γ 1 19 γ torsethaugen 2004 categorizes spectra into swell dominated and wind dominated groups based on the following criterion 13 t p f a f h s 1 3 where t p f is the spectral peak period for fully developed wind sea besides a f is a fetch dependent duration factor for long fetches a f 6 6 can be applied based on this criterion for t p t p f the spectrum is wind dominated and for t p t p f it is a swell dominated one panahi et al 2016 calibrated this model for the region using sfi method the calibration procedure and all the related parameters based on 2007 dataset can be found in panahi et al 2016 work 4 data preparation at this stage all the required inputs for the required statistical analysis to modify the ochi hubble model were prepared fig 2 statistical analysis involved pre processing of the raw data using storm v1 14 software storm 2018 and then selection of representative double peaked events two parallel procedures were started following the left side of fig 2 representative events were categorized based on their total significant wave height as well as dominance of swell or wind sea system using the criterion introduced by torsethaugen 1993 additionally such events were separated into swell and wind sea components using the criterion introduced by guedes soares 1984 then all the required parameters for the ochi hubble model were quantified right side of fig 2 4 1 data pre processing in order to calculate wave parameters storm v1 14 was used it is a graphical wave and current profile data processing software in which suv technology a nortek s patented wave data collection and processing technique pedersen et al 2005 is implemented this software generates non directional wave spectrum by three methods pressure based velocity based and acoustic surface tracking ast considering software recommendations ast method is the most suitable one for awac devices hence optimized option was activated in the software by which ast is used as the primary means for wave energy spectrum extraction if the software deems that ast results have more than 10 outliers then it would automatically revert to the pressure method in depths less than 20m or the velocity method in depths greater than 20m a smoothing value of 128 was considered appropriate as the highest possible value the smoothing value specifies how many fft bins are used at each frequency the greater the number of bins the smoother the spectra appears conversely lower number of bins results in spikier spectra the smoothing value does not change the total energy but may slightly change the distribution of energy in addition an end frequency of 0 5 hz is selected based on the suggestions of a previous work panahi et al 2016 all settings are presented in table 2 4 2 selection of double peaked spectra after pre processing a reasonable number of the double peaked spectra was selected all the peaks within the time history of measurements with a significant wave height greater than 0 9m were extracted see fig 3 for clarification this preliminary criterion resulted in 3256 events peaks then these events were checked via criteria introduced by guedes soares 1984 to find out which one was a double peaked spectrum guedes soares 1984 suggests a minimum distance of 0 03 hz between peak frequencies of a double peaked spectrum besides the energy of a trough between two spectral peaks should be smaller than 90 of energy of each peak the criteria resulted in 911 double peaked spectra as representative events distributed over all the stations it is worth mentioning that the threshold of 0 9 m was based on previous studies in the region to gather enough number of representative events for the statistical analysis panahi et al 2016 4 3 categorization of spectra in this subsection categorization of representative events into two groups based on the dominance of swell or wind sea components is detailed then the division of each group into five classes based on the value of significant wave height is explained 4 3 1 two groups of spectra all the double peaked spectra were divided into swell dominated and wind dominated groups using torsethaugen 2004 criterion eq 13 this division originated from the assumption that spectra in the same group share similar characteristics the criterion worked well for the representative events as in a swell dominated spectrum the area under the swell part is greater than the area under the wind sea component and vice versa by applying the criterion to the events it was concluded that 62 of the representative events were swell dominated and the remaining 38 were wind dominated as summarized in table 3 4 3 2 five classes of spectra swell dominated and wind dominated groups were both classified into five classes based on their total significant wave height although the ochi hubble standard model offers ten classes in this study five classes were selected as summarized in table 4 the reason for the reduction in the number of classes was the smaller interval of significant wave height at the region under study statistical analysis was then applied on each class of both swell dominated and wind dominated groups representative h s in table 4 i e more or less the middle value of the class was used as an indicative value of each class for the following statistical analysis 4 4 extraction of required parameters as the last step of data preparation six parameters of ochi hubble spectral model were extracted this included separation of wind sea and swell components followed by the calculation of six parameters as described below 4 4 1 separation of wind sea and swell components of spectra after calculation of h m 0 and t p of all the double peaked spectra it was essential to divide each spectrum into its low frequency and high frequency components to evaluate six parameters of the ochi hubble spectrum available separation methods could be classified into one dimensional and two dimensional li and zhao 2012 one dimensional methods are more practical because they need neither wind vector nor wave direction additionally most of them are based on the introduction of a separation frequency f s to cut a double peaked spectrum into its two components li and zhao 2012 one of the latest methods proposed by hwang et al 2012 calculates the separation frequency using a spectrum integration method this method was used in this study as it was implemented earlier by panahi et al 2016 4 4 2 quantification of six parameters of the ochi hubble model six parameters of the ochi hubble model describing low frequency or swell j 1 and high frequency or wind sea j 2 components of the spectrum must be formulated based on their real value extracted from the dataset significant wave height was calculated for each component based on the zeroth moment of the wave spectrum m 0 as below sorensen 2005 14 h m 0 4 m 0 where m 0 denotes the area under the spectral curve benefiting from separation frequency hwang et al 2012 the share of swell and wind sea components under the spectral curve was quantified therefore h 1 and h 2 were calculated as below 15 h 1 4 m 0 s w e l l 16 h 2 4 m 0 w i n d also the following relationship holds ochi and hubble 1977 17 h 1 2 h 2 2 h s 2 peak frequencies of low and high frequency components f 1 and f 2 were easily quantified by a simple program sweeping representative events most challenging parameters were λ 1 and λ 2 in order to determine them already extracted values of h 1 h 2 f 1 f 2 were put into the standard ochi hubble formula eq 1 as constant parameters and two initial numbers were assumed for λ 1 and λ 2 firstly with λ 1 and λ 2 as variables the root mean square error between resulted ochi hubble model spectrum and observed spectrum was minimized to identify λ 1 and λ 2 then maximizing coefficient of determination was set as the target to obtain λ 1 and λ 2 it was observed that finding λ 1 and λ 2 based on minimization of rmse results in a better fit between observed spectra and resulted ochi hubble model in other words by minimizing the rmse a greater coefficient of determination closer to 1 was obtained while trying to reach higher coefficient of determination leads to significant increase in rmse nonlinear generalized reduced gradient algorithm was again used to find best λ 1 and λ 2 lasdon et al 1974 5 statistical analysis according to the ochi hubble model the final goal of statistical analysis is finding a concrete relation between total significant wave height of the event and six parameters of the model this effort leads to a family of spectra within 95 confidence limit therefore after data preparation stage explained in section 4 statistical analysis procedure began including four steps as illustrated in fig 4 the procedure was applied on all the five classes of both swell and wind dominated groups separately the analysis procedure was as follows start for a group one of the six parameters of the ochi hubble model e g h 1 was assigned as a target parameter tp step 1 probability density distribution pd of tp with the best fit to the data of each class was identified using minitab v16 2 4 five pds with respect to five classes for example fig 5 shows that h 1 in class s iii obeys a normal pd as the best estimation in comparison with other distributions step 2 based on the determined pds three values of tp were extracted as mode lower bound and upper bound of 95 confidence interval from each pd i e three values for each class for example consider fig 6 showing normal pd of h 1 along with mode lower and upper 95 bound values of h 1 in class s iii i e 0 72m 0 42m and 1 03m respectively then considering three series mode lower and upper bounds of five classes relation between tp and representative h s was drawn for instance fig 7 a shows that for a swell dominated group step 3 corresponding values of other five parameters associated with three extracted values of tp at each class were determined to draw diagrams just like fig 7 a to clarify this step consider h 1 and its mode value in class s iii equal to 0 72m its 5 values were 0 68m and 0 76m in order to find the value of f 1 associated to mode value of h 1 average of f 1 coincident with h 1 between 0 68m and 0 76m in s iii was determined this was equal to 0 082 hz hence f 1 value associated with h 1 mode value in class s iii spectra was found finally by applying the procedure on all remaining five parameters of ochi hubble model associated with tp e g h 1 including three modal values in five classes for swell dominated group fig 7 b 7 f were obtained modified spectra after running the procedure for the first time over swell dominated group of spectra three sets of the modified ochi hubble model were extracted with respect to the first tp one of them represents spectra with respect to mode values and two others give it for 95 confidence the procedure was continued by setting the next parameter in the list of six parameters of ochi hubble model as tp and starting again e g on swell dominated group it is worth noting that fig 7 is just associated with a specific tp here in the swell dominated group and leads to three sets of relations i e three spectra consequently by applying the same procedure on other parameters as tp eighteen spectra were derived including six sets associated with the mode value six sets associated with the upper bound value and six sets associated with the lower bound value in the swell dominated group six spectra associated with the mode value of six tp behaved reasonably similar to each other as shown in fig 8 hence in order to simplify the model eighteen spectra were decreased to thirteen ones by considering the spectrum associated with the mode value of h 1 as the representative of the six spectra associated with mode value of six parameters 6 results and discussion in this section results are presented and discussed at first formulation and coefficients of the modified ochi hubble model is elaborated on then performance comparison of the modified model with previous calibrated models for the region panahi et al 2016 is provided finally the modified model performance assessment based on 2006 2007 dataset is presented 6 1 modified ochi hubble model by carrying out the procedure described earlier in section 5 a family of 13 ochi hubble spectra for both swell and wind dominated groups was developed within 95 occurrence confidence interval basic forms for calculation of required six parameters in such spectra were as follow 18 h 1 a 1 exp b 1 h s 19 h 2 h s 2 h 1 2 20 f j c j exp d j h s 21 λ j e j exp f j h s table 5 shows value of the aforementioned coefficients in two groups these values are supposed to be used in eq 1 to represent the modified ochi hubble spectra 6 2 performance of modified ochi hubble spectra modified spectra were compared to standard ochi hubble model ochi and hubble 1977 to identify any improvement occurred through modification moreover two other spectra calibrated for the region i e those calibrated ochi hubble and calibrated torsethaugen models based on 2007 dataset by panahi et al 2016 were employed to evaluate performance of the modified ochi hubble against them over the 2016 dataset this evaluation is illustrated by figs 9 11 in three events each event is representative of a different condition swell dominated wind dominated and equal share of swell and wind sea apparently the modified model proposed in this study outperformed the other models as it followed the trend of observed spectrum shape more appropriately also it was more successful in finding the location of peaks i e peak frequencies however such qualitative assessments with respect to typical spectra are not able to demonstrate the general performance of the presented model the performance of all the spectra should be evaluated using suitable measures therefore the accuracy of model was investigated using average of three goodness of fit measures as below root mean square error rmse normalized difference of the area under the spectrum δa a and normalized difference of the peak frequency δf p f p table 6 shows average rmse δa a and δf p f p for each family of the standard ochi hubble model ochi and hubble 1977 calibrated ochi hubble and torsethaugen models panahi et al 2016 and the modified ochi hubble model current study results can be discussed from two points of view their rmse and δf p f p and δa a rmse and δf p f p show how exact the shape of modeled spectrum obeys the shape of corresponding observed spectrum in the meantime δa a shows the accuracy of estimated spectrum energy therefore these three measures were justified as minimum requirements to investigate the performance of the modified model as shown in table 6 the best performance of standard ochi hubble model belongs to the family no 9 the bold one with an rmse equal to 0 20 in addition rmse of calibrated ochi hubble and torsethaugen models are 0 18 and 0 17 respectively however lowest rmse of the modified ochi hubble model is 0 14 the bold one which belongs to family no 1 the most probable spectrum as it introduces the best performance when compared to other spectra standard ochi hubble model sometimes even failed to show two peaks of a spectrum so high rmse values are not surprising δf p f p of the modified ochi hubble model has improved generally in comparison with the other models it is worth mentioning that δf p f p of calibrated torsethaugen model is equal to 0 however it is not a great achievement because f p was directly inserted into this model was equal to its real field value there is no significant difference for δa a when comparing standard and the modified ochi hubble models however the modified model s δa a is considerably less than both previous calibrated models overall it seems that the modified model current study has a superior performance in comparison with the standard model and previous calibrated models according to all three evaluation measures rmse δf p f p and δa a 6 3 performance of the modified ochi hubble model based on previous data 2006 2007 dataset it is still a question that whether a spectrum localized based on measurement in a specific period is a good choice for that location over time or not this was examined in this study by comparing the performance of modified ochi hubble model calibrated based on 2016 dataset with representative events of 2007 here standard ochi hubble ochi and hubble 1977 and those calibrated ochi hubble and calibrated torsethaugen models based on 2007 dataset panahi et al 2016 also were included consequently an evaluation procedure similar to the previous subsection was conducted both qualitatively and quantitatively this is presented in figs 12 14 in which three distinct events are swell dominated wind dominated and equal share of swell and wind sea components similarly it seems that the modified model still acts as the superior model for a comprehensive analysis table 7 provides the evaluation measures rmse δf p f p and δa a for all the 2007 dataset goodness of fit measures reveal that family no 1 of the modified model again shows a better performance except for δf p f p which for the calibrated torsethaugen model is slightly it can be concluded that general performance of the modified ochi hubble still surpass the other models even using another dataset of the region 7 conclusion wave spectrum is an inseparable input of design procedures for coastal and offshore structures in case of concurrent presence of both swell and wind waves in a field wave spectra usually exhibit two peaks typically represented by double peaked spectral formula there are well known efforts to represent double peaked spectra e g ochi hubble 1977 guedes soares 1984 and torsethaugen 2004 there are also researches to localize such formula for specific times and spaces this study benefited from two extensive datasets at the gulf of oman i e 2016 dataset and 2006 2007 dataset to improve the ochi hubble 1977 model for this specific region based on flexibility of this model the original statistical analysis performed by ochi hubble 1977 was applied on 2016 dataset representative events i e selected double peaked spectra of the region were divided into swell dominated and wind dominated groups according to the criterion introduced by torsethaugen 2004 this resulted in developing a family of 13 spectra covering 95 confidence interval performance of the resulted modified model investigated against 2016 dataset as well as already calibrated spectra at the region based on 2007 dataset panahi et al 2016 performance of the modified model approved by three evaluation measures average value of root mean square error normalized difference of the area under the spectrum and normalized difference of the peak frequency these measures assess similarity of spectra in shape and their level of accuracy in order to investigate the performance of the modified model over time it examined against 2006 2007 dataset as well as already calibrated models at the region based on 2006 2007 dataset panahi et al 2016 similarly the modified model performed better that those calibrated based on 2007 dataset as this study is among the very limited research trying to discuss the issue of verification of spectra over time the avenue for future research is open a final remark should be made to bring the attention that this approach is fine as long as one is dealing with scalar or frequency spectra the physical reality is more complex because spectra varying in directions and sea states are only fully described by directional spectra as discussed by boukhanovsky and guedes soares 2009 lucas et al 2011 and panahi et al 2015 considering this complexity is another idea to work on in the future finally yet importantly as there are discussions on the form of swell and wind sea components of double peaked spectra it could offer a good idea to examine combination of different spectra at the region lucas and guedes soares 2015
