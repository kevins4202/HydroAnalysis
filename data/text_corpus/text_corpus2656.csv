been described three new au zif 11 composites abbreviated as au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z have been synthesized via direct reduction of haucl4 0 1 to 0 3 mm using sodium borohydride nabh4 in the suspension of pre synthesized zif 11 and characterized by various spectroscopic and morphological surface techniques tem images confirmed the formation of spherical and uniformly distributed gold nps having average particle size of 7 35 0 95 nm on the surface of zif 11 microcrystals au0 2z displayed exceptionally high catalytic efficiency towards the reduction of nitrophenols 2 nphenol 3 nphenol

that au nanoparticles immobilized onto zif 11 may serve as antenna to transfer electrons and hydrogen from borohydride bh4 ions to the acceptor nitro group organic dye therefore au0 2z can effectively

au zif 11 composite efficiently reduced nitroaromatic compounds and organic dyes in very less time unlabelled image keywords au nps zif 11 heterogeneous catalysis nitrophenols organic colouring dyes 1 introduction the degradation of water quality is dangerously increasing and in the 21st century the challenge is enormous causing existential threats to biodiversity and multiple human populations and undermining economic progress and human life sustainability water pollution is mainly due to the offloading of untreated effluents of various industries into the aquatic bodies organic pollutants such as organic colouring dyes mb rhb cr and mo and highly stable nitroaromatic compounds viz 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol and picric acid are extremely harmful to aquatic life as well as to human textile industry s residual waters containing colouring dyes increase the levels of oxygen demand both biochemical bod and chemical cod these dyes have high solubility and stability in water and impart intense colour into the aqueous systems at even ppm levels thus changing the optical properties of water and it has adverse effects on aesthetic quality clarity and water gas solubility 1 the light penetration depth decreases with increasing the concentration of dye or toxic agent in water which reduces the photosynthesis process and lowers the formation of planktons that are a crucial source of food for marine animals 2 the anaerobic biodegradability of dyes is exceptionally low and highly carcinogenic compounds are produced upon their anaerobic biodegradation 3 which may also degrade human health nitrophenols as effluents with high solubility and stability from various industries producing pesticides herbicides and synthetic dyes have been declared as the major pollutants in the aqueous system by the environmental protection agency of united states due to their carcinogenic mutagenic and inhibitory properties however nitrophenols especially 4 nitrophenol 4 nphenol becomes a valuable substrate because 4 aminophenol 4 aphenol the final product obtained on reduction of 4 nphenol is a vital chemical used as a photographic developer corrosion inhibitor drying agent and as an intermediate in many industries such as dyes drugs and oil additives 4 5 now a days many attempts have now been made to design and build advanced multifunctional materials by sustainable procedures for the efficient treatment of industrial wastewater metal organic frameworks mofs are one of such type of functional materials an intriguing category of highly crystalline porous frameworks produced by self assembly of metal ions or clusters and organic linkers they possess extremely high surface area open metal sites and tailorable porosities 6 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zifs with varying topologies rho and sod have emerged as a very special subclass of mofs made of zinc or cobalt ion as metal part and imidazole its derivatives as ligands 7 zifs are highly thermally and chemically stable along with huge surface area and incredible porosity and can be utilized as an ideal candidate for a number of critical applications such as heterogeneous catalysts 8 supercapacitor 9 and in separation of gases 10 gas sensing 11 and drug delivery 12 zifs owing to their large surface area can be utilized to immobilize variety of metal oxides sulphides and nanoparticles which are prone to agglomerate and porous nature of zifs provides excellent platform to allow reactants substrates to adsorb and interact with each other recently tio2 cds sno2 wo3 zno sno2 and ag nanoparticles were encapsulated in zif 8 and their applications for photodegradation of organic pollutants were reported from our research group 13 19 au pd and pt nanoparticles were decorated on nanotube mof zif 8 and mil 101 for photocatalytic production of h2 ammonia borane hydrolysis aerobic alcohol oxidation coupling reactions and hydrogenation 20 21 among zifs zif 8 and zif 67 are extensively studied materials while other analogues of this class are not widely studied especially for organocatalytic applications zif 11 is another zeolitic imidazolate framework with rho topology with large pores 14 6 å and comparatively smaller pore apertures 3 0 å and it is widely used in gas separation in the last few years zif 11 polymer mixed matrix membranes mmms were fabricated for various gas separation viz fda dam zif 11 mmms for separation of co2 ch4 and h2 ch4 10 zif 11 pebax 2533 mmms for separation of h2 ch4 and h2 n2 22 zif 11 polyimide matrimid 23 zif 11 in pbi mmms 24 and zif 11 polybenzimidazole mmms 25 for separation of h2 and co2 during the last decade gold nanoparticles au nps are intensively investigated for several catalytic reactions such as co oxidation 26 methanol oxidation 27 cross coupling reactions 28 and 4 nphenol reduction 29 only three reports have been found on au ag nanoparticles loaded mofs such as au mil 100 fe 30 au ag on mof 76 6 and ag zif 7 31 used for reduction of 4 nitrophenol and a highly chemically and thermally stable zif 11 is yet to explore for the immobilization of catalytically active metallic nps like au ag pd and pt keeping this under consideration the present manuscript demonstrates the robust and sustainable synthesis of zif 11 microcrystals and three au zif 11 composites at room temperature as synthesized zif 11 and composites were

has been established as well 2 experimental section 2 1 materials zn ch3coo 2 2h2o zinc acetate dihydrate benzimidazole methanol toluene ammonium hydroxide haucl4 2 nitrophenol 2 nphenol 3 nitrophenol 3 nphenol 4 nitrophenol 4 nphenol 4 nitroaniline 4 nani and 2 4 6 trinitrophenol all were acquired from sigma aldrich congo red c32h22n6na2o6s2 merck methylene blue c16h18cln3s lobachemie rhodamine b c28h31cln2o lobachemie and methyl orange c14h14n3nao3s merck and sodium borohydride nabh4 merck were used as obtained all solutions were prepared in milli q water 2 2 synthesis of zif 11 one step crystallization procedure as reported earlier 23 was adopted for the production of zif 11 by dissolving benzimidazole 0 48 g 4 mmol into a mixture of solvents comprising methanol 12 8 g 800 mmol toluene 18 4 g 200 mmol and ammonium hydroxide 4 8 g 80 mmol zinc acetate dihydrate 0 44 g 2 mmol was completely dissolved in methanol 6 4 g 400 mmol in an ice bath both ligand and metal solutions were cooled down to 20 c next zinc metal solution was introduced to benzimidazole ligand solution dropwise with continuous stirring the stirring was resumed for another 3 h the white product was obtained by centrifugation for 15 min at 1000 rpm washed 4 times with methanol and kept in hot air oven at 120 c for 12 h for drying 2 3 synthesis of au zif 11 composites three different au zif 11 composites were produced by dissolving 100 mg of as prepared zif 11 and varying amounts of haucl4 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 mmol in 100 ml of milli q water and kept into an ultrasonic bath for 30 min then solution was kept in an ice bath to achieve 20 c followed by addition of 0 01 m solution of nabh4 1 ml 2 ml and 3 ml of nabh4 for 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 mmol of haucl4 respectively under continuous stirring the stirring was continued for 5 min the composites were recovered by centrifugation and washing was done with water and methanol then dried in a hot air oven at 60 c overnight the samples were represented as au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z based on the added amount of haucl4 2 4 catalytic activity of au zif 11 composites towards reduction of nitroaromatics the stock solutions 5 mm of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid were prepared in milli q water in an experimental set up of nitrophenol s reduction 100 μl 5 mm of nitroaromatic compound 1 ml of 0 04 m nabh4 and 2 ml of water were poured into a quartz cuvette the suspension of the catalyst was made by dispersing au0 2z 2 mg into 2 ml milli q water and sonicated for 30 min for 4 nphenol 3 nphenol 2 nphenol and p nani 50 μl of above suspension of au zif 11 utilized as a catalyst was introduced into the quartz cuvette and 100 μl of it was used for picric acid a transition in colour from pale yellow to bright yellow and then colourless was detected uv vis ultraviolet visible spectra were collected after each minute sometimes after every 30 s at ambient conditions 25 1 c 1 atm in a range of 200 700 nm all the reduction experiments were performed in triplicate 2 5 catalytic activity of au zif 11 composites towards reduction of organic dyes standard solutions of mb rhb cr and mo 1000 ppm were made separately for a typical reduction experiment of organic dyes 3 ml water 300 μl of nabh4 0 04 m and calculated volume of stock solution of dye were added to a quartz cuvette to produce final concentrations of 5 ppm of mo 10 ppm of mb 10 ppm of cr and 5 ppm of rhb with total volume of 3 35 ml 50 μl of au0 2z catalyst 1 mg per ml suspension was introduced as a catalyst for cr and mo while 100 μl of catalyst was used for mb and rhb the reduction was monitored by recording uv vis spectra per every 1 min in the 200 700 nm range at standard conditions 25 1 c 1 atm 2 6 catalytic reusability to recycle the catalyst the catalyst au0 2z was recovered after the completion of each catalytic reduction reaction the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min and catalyst was filtered washed and dried for next cycle fresh solution of nitroaromatic compound was taken and sonicated with recovered catalyst for 1 min to re disperse the catalyst followed by the addition of nabh4 solution to start the reaction which was monitored by noting absorbance with time pxrd of the used catalyst after 5 cycles was also recorded to ascertain its stability 2 7 instrumental techniques the details of procedures employed in various instrumental techniques and specifications of the corresponding instruments used for characterization of the materials are same as reported earlier 15 17 and summarized in the supporting file 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic aspect and characterization of zif 11 and composites au zif 11 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with different phase compositions have been synthesized with slight change in the reaction conditions such as temperature and solvents and this has also been observed for zif 11 32 33 zif 11 has been synthesized through solvothermal process in n n diethylformamide def as a solvent the steric hindrance from 4th and 5th position of substituted imidazole ligand and amide solvent interaction was deemed to direct the topology of rho in zifs therefore the solvents used during zif 11 synthesis are limited to amide solvent def and dmf although the solvent s function not completely known because the dmf kinetic diameter 5 2 5 5 å is bigger than the rho type zifs pore size further the extraction of dmf from the pores of zif 11 is arduous procedure which restricts the further application of zif 11 particularly in gas separation and gas adsorption 34 in addition small quantities of water found in def can contribute to the formation of zif 7 iii impure phase along with zif 11 phase 32 35 when we look at the geometry of zif 11 the phim s four benzene units point inward into the ring and shape a flattened octagon the creation of flattened octagons is the key element in the formulation of wide cage zifs which can be realised by tempering with organic molecules another of the commonly recognized non covalent forces governing the biomolecular structure are the intermolecular π π interactions thus during the formation of rho type zif 11 toluene was taken as the template molecule and ammonium hydroxide facilitated deprotonation of imidazole ligand 34 methanol provides greater solubility of reactants and can be quickly separated from the zif 11 pores therefore we synthesized zif 11 by the interaction of imidazole and zinc acetate dihydrate in 2 1 molar ratio in a mixture of solvents such as methanol toluene ammonium hydroxide in 10 2 5 1 molar ratio 23 three samples of au zif 11 composite were prepared by adding 0 1 mm 0 2 mm 0 3 mm of haucl4 into the as synthesized zif 11 followed by the wet reduction of haucl4 using nabh4 0 01 m as a reducing agent powder x ray diffraction pxrd results confirmed the formation of zif 11 and au zif 11 fig 1 a d and fig s1 a the characteristic diffraction peaks in zif 11 fig 1 a at 2θ angle of 6 11 7 53 8 95 9 76 12 32 13 06 13 80 15 74 16 94 18 49 corresponded to 200 211 220 310 400 330 420 510 521 and 600 planes respectively with cubic pm3 m space group and are in near with the values reported previously 33 36 very intense peaks of metallic au appeared in pxrd patterns of au0 1z fig 1 b au0 2z fig 1 c and au0 3z fig 1 d at 2θ angle of 38 18 44 39 64 57 77 54 and 81 72 matching to 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of cubic phase of gold having fm3m space group matched with jcpds 04 0784 37 the peaks of zif 11 can be clearly seen in all composites on the lower side of 2θ see inset in fig 1 b d this explicitly verified the distribution of au0 over zif 11 after the complete reduction of haucl4 and no other diffraction peaks for any impurity was found the crystallite size of au nanoparticles 18 46 nm was calculated by debye scherrer formula using highest intensity peak at 2θ angle of 38 18 corresponding to au 111 plane further decoration of au nps onto zif 11 was examined by several techniques as discussed below fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of zif 11 au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z are illustrated in fig s1 b characteristic absorption peaks of zif 11 micro crystals were observed at 3082 3067 3033 cm 1 aromatics stretching and 1610 and 1465 cm 1 for cc of benzimidazole ring stretching additional peaks at 1287 cm 1 benzimidazole ring breathing and 1244 cm 1 for ch deformation in plane of benzimidazole ring were also observed sharp bands at 1180 1118 910 and 774 cm 1 were observed for benzimidazole bending in plane ch nh ch out of plane bending and imidazole ring bending respectively 38 all the peaks of zif 11 appeared in ftir spectra of au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z without the appearance of any other new peak a small shift in the stretching frequency of nh is observed zif 11 υ nh at 1111 cm 1 while in au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z υ nh at 1118 cm 1 this may be due to donor accepter type of behaviour between an electron deficient au atom and an electron rich n atom 39 the full scan surface xps and the expanded xps spectra of all constituent s atoms with their orbitals of zif 11 and au0 2z are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively and those of au0 1z and au0 3z are displayed in figs s2 and s3 respectively presence of all non hydrogen constituents elements c n and zn was detected in full scan xps spectra of zif 11 the modest intensity xps peaks corresponding to zn 2p3 2 and zn 3p1 2 were present at binding energy of 1022 04 ev and 1044 8 ev respectively low intensity peaks at 10 51 89 30 and 140 48 ev corresponding to zn 3d5 2 zn 3p3 2 and zn 1s respectively were also identified expanded and deconvoluted spectra of zn 2p is shown in fig 2 b and the similar patterns are observed in au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z composites fig s2 b fig 3 b and fig s3 b an intense peak at 284 87 ev matching with c 1s appeared in zif 11 fig 2 c whereas c 1s appeared with small variation in binding energy values in au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z fig s2 c fig 3 c and fig s3 c a moderate intensity peak appeared at 399 05 ev corresponding to n 1s was also detected in all the composites with slight deviation from that of zif 11 and the deconvoluted spectra are depicted in fig 2 d fig s2 d fig 3 d and fig s3 d this may be due to some sorts of interaction between au nanoparticles facing towards the imidazole n of zif 11 matrix in addition to the xps peaks of zn 3p n 1s and c 1s four sharp and very intense peaks corresponding to au 4d3 2 au 4d5 2 au 4f5 2 and au 4f7 2 were also observed at binding energy of 354 85 336 85 88 34 and 84 88 ev respectively in au0 2z fig 3 a and e 40 41 and these peaks are also present in au0 1z and au0 3z and the corresponding expanded spectra of au 4f are depicted in figs s2 e and s3 e table 1 summarizes the results of xps the morphological study of zif 11 and au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z composites were conducted by fesem and tem hrtem regular rhombic dodecahedron shaped microcrystals of zif 11 are shown in fig 4 a and au nanoparticles immobilized on zif 11 in composites are shown in fig 4 b d indicating no variation in morphology of zif 11 after loading au nps on the surface of zif 11 furthermore tem image fig 5 a of au0 2z also revealed the intact morphology and formation of au nanoparticles on zif 11 micro crystals the tem picture fig 5 b illustrated nano sized au particle anchored on zif 11 the interplanar spacing d spacing of gold nanoparticles in hrtem image fig 5 c was 0 23 nm corresponding to au 111 plane which is in good agreement with d spacing calculated by pxrd the saed pattern displaying various crystal planes from au nanoparticles established its polycrystalline nature fig 5 d and the mean particle size measured by employing imagej software was 7 35 0 95 nm fig s4 the porosities and surface areas of zif 11 and its composites were studied using bet n2 adsorption desorption fig 6 and n2 sorption isotherms fig 7 at 77 k and the results are given in table 2 zif 11 displayed a surface area of 608 78 m2 g 1 and it further decreased to 34 89 m2 g 1 72 02 m2 g 1 and 59 64 m2 g 1 respectively for au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z fig 6 these results again confirmed that au nanoparticles deposition on zif 11 surface prevents immediate accessibility to zif 11 pores additionally the distribution of pore size fig s5 and pore volume were also determined the mean pore size of zif 11 au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z was 36 21 å 37 92 å 38 28 å and 38 60 å respectively table 2 fig s5 the observed bet surface area 608 78 m2 g 1 of zif 11 is higher than that 392 m2 g 1 observed previously for zif 11 synthesized from anhydrous zncl2 and benzimidazole in methanol toluene mixture 33 indicating that surface properties also depend upon the methodology used further the observed value is in close agreement with that 605 11 m2 g 1 reported by morris et al 42 whereas park et al 36 reported 1676 0 m2 g 1 from computational molecular dynamics simulation n2 sorption isotherms of zif 11 and its composites showed type i profile fig 7 which suggest the permanent micro porosity and it was found to be in good agreement with the earlier studies on zif 11 33 36 42 the open end adsorption desorption nitrogen hysteresis characteristic of standard microporous material with high surface area was observed and gate opening behaviour similar to that in zif 7 was seen 42 although the average pore size zif 11 is very large but the pore aperture size is just 3 0 å due to the existence of the side ring on the imidazole ligand while the kinetic diameter of n2 molecule is 3 6 å and hence the n2 uptake in lower relative pressure range is low 33 42 when the relative pressure exceeded the gate opening pressure in the case of as synthesized zif 11 p p0 0 052 a gradual rise in n2 absorption is observed which continued with increase in relative pressure the benzimidazole ligand rotational motion and interaction between zif 11 network and n2 gas molecules led to the swelling of pore openings elastic deformations thereby allowing the adsorption of larger molecules than expected 33 36 43 44 similar behaviour was found in all three composites and a substantial reduction was found in pore volume the pore volume for zif 11 reduced from 0 4329 cm3 g 1 to 0 0414 cm3 g 1 0 0668 cm3 g 1 and 0 0655 cm3 g 1 for au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z respectively indicating that au nanoparticles covered zif 11 microcrystal pores table 2 3 2 catalytic activity of au zif 11 composites for reduction of nitroaromatic compounds nabh4 can reduce 4 nphenol and this reaction is thermodynamically feasible because δe0 of the reaction is greater than zero e0 4 nphenol 4 ap 0 76 v and e0 h3bo3 bh4 1 33 v δe0 0 67 v but its kinetic feasibility decreases owing to the substantial potential gap between nabh4 donor and 4 nphenol acceptor molecules 45 completion time for the reduction of 4 nphenol without any catalyst was investigated by liao et al and it was 32 h indicating exceptionally low kinetic feasibility of the reduction reaction of 4 nphenol 46 we studied the reduction of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid using zif 11 and its composites au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z as a catalyst the advancement of catalytic reduction reaction was observed by using uv vis spectrophotometer the aqueous solution of nitroaromatics shows light yellow colour which turns into intense yellow as nabh4 was added due to formation of the corresponding phenolate ions 4 nphenol has absorption maxima at 317 nm in aqueous solution which quickly shifts to 400 nm as soon as nabh4 was poured due to the transformation of 4 nphenol to 4 nitrophenolate ion 47 reduction reaction proceeds very slowly without any catalyst which can be monitored by a decline in the intensity of the peak at 400 nm with time and simultaneous increase in the intensity of a fresh peak at 298 nm due to the formation of the product i e 4 aminophenol likewise the reduction of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid was tracked by measuring a decrease in the intensity of the absorption peak at λmax of the corresponding phenolate ion at 414 388 380 and 388 nm respectively and concomitantly 2 nphenol transformed to 2 aminophenol 3 nphenol to 3 aminophenol and 4 nitroaniline to p phenylenediamine similarly 2 4 6 triaminophenol was obtained after the reduction of three nitro groups existing in picric acid the nabh4 concentration was kept quite high 0 04 m in each experiment considered as constant as compared to that of nitroaromatics 1 587 10 4 m such a control experiment was performed with each nitroaromatic compound using nabh4 0 04 m as a reducing agent and no catalyst was added to the reaction system fig s6 and table s1 negligible reduction was observed in case of 2 nphenol 7 90 3 nphenol 4 11 and 4 nphenol 5 04 whereas 4 nani 24 30 and picric acid 36 08 reduced significantly within 15 min in addition it was found that after 15 min the colour of the picric acid solution remained yellow instead of colourless fig s7 similar experiments were performed using zif 11 as a catalyst and the results are presented in fig s8 and table s2 a marginal decrease 2 35 to 3 46 within 15 min in the efficiency of zif 11 for the catalytic reduction of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol and 4 nphenol was accomplished whereas a large decrease was observed in case of 4 nani 5 55 reduction was observed as compared to 24 30 without zif 11 this may be partly due to some sorts of interactions between the substrate ions and zn2 and partly due to porous nature of zif 11 on the other hand zif 11 enhanced the reduction of 2 4 6 trinitrophenol picric acid reduced 44 64 as compared to 36 08 in absence of zif 11 but the solution retained yellow colour fig s9 the reduction of all nitroaromatics using au nps as a catalyst in presence of nabh4 has also been investigated and the results are given in fig s10 i ii and table s3 au nps performed more effectively than zif 11 and within 15 min it reduced 64 67 of 2 nphenol 100 of 3 nphenol 66 52 of 4 nphenol 100 of 4 nani and 45 51 of picric acid and also reduced 94 19 of 2 nphenol and 92 12 of 4 nphenol within 35 and 30 min respectively whereas about 79 of picric acid was reduced within 40 min the catalytic reduction efficiency of au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z using 50 μl of suspension containing 1 mg of catalyst in 1 ml was analysed against 4 nphenol as typical pollutant compound the catalytic reduction efficiency was quantitatively monitored by measuring the variations in the absorption peak s intensity at about 400 nm at the interval of 1 min just after the addition of the composite au0 1z au0 2z au0 3z fig 8 au0 1z achieved the complete 100 reduction within 6 min while au0 2z and au0 3z accomplished it within 3 min and 10 min respectively and therefore au0 2z was used for further reduction experiments of other nitroaromatic compounds further concomitant increase in the absorbance of the peak at 298 nm attributed to 4 aphenol was observed in fig 8 the isosbestic points show that no other side reaction had occurred all the three composites have been found to exhibit excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to zif 11 and au nps fig 9 a shows that composite au0 2z enhanced the complete catalytic conversion of 2 nphenol to 2 aphenol within 3 min while 3 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid have been converted to corresponding amino compounds in 1 5 and 12 min respectively fig 9 b d respectively a graph of c0 c vs time fig 9 e depicts the progress of reduction reaction with time the concentration of reducing agent nabh4 0 04 m was much larger than the substrate s concentration and therefore the rate of the reaction was considering to be dependent only on concentration of substrate the ln c c0 vs time was plotted and a straight line fig 9 f was obtained which clearly indicates that the langmuir hinshelwood l h apparent first order kinetics is applicable for the reduction reaction of substrate as given by eq 1 1 r dc dt kkc 1 kc r mg l 1 s 1 signifies rate of substrate s reduction c is substrate s concentration mg l 1 t is total time required to complete the reaction k mg l 1 s 1 represents the rate constant k l mg 1 stands for the adsorption coefficient of substrate if c0 starting concentration of the substrate is quite low then eq 1 may be written as 2 ln c c 0 k k t k app t where k app s 1 apparent first order rate constant the slope of the plot of ln c0 c vs time provides the values of k app which are presented in table 3 the k app for the reduction of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid are 1 90 10 2 4 64 10 2 3 24 10 2 1 19 10 2 and 4 00 10 2 s 1 respectively activity constant turn over number k k app m where m is weight of catalyst in gram was determined to provide further understanding into the reduction process the calculated k values are 380 61 928 83 647 59 239 49 and 40 04 s 1 g 1 for 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid respectively the recyclic test for the catalyst was also performed and au0 2z showed high activity and reusability up to 5 cycles fig s11 further in comparison to zif 11 and au nps the composite au0 2z performed excellently and the rate of reduction is much faster with complete reduction in lesser time as given in table 4 3 3 catalytic activity of au zif 11 composites for reduction of organic colouring dyes the composite au0 2z was also explored for its catalytic efficiency for reduction reactions of conventional organic colouring dyes viz methylene blue mb methyl orange mo rhodamine b rhb and congo red cr assisted by sodium borohydride nabh4 as a reductant at ambient conditions progression of catalytic reduction of the studied dyes was observed by measuring a decline in absorbance fig 10 a d at λmax of the corresponding organic colouring dye mo λmax 464 nm cr 496 nm rhb 554 nm and mb 663 nm the studied organic dyes 5 to 10 ppm were completely decolourized within 7 to 57 min mo 5 ppm cr 10 ppm mb 10 ppm and rhb 5 ppm in 7 20 10 and 57 min respectively by employing 100 μl of a suspension containing 1 mg per 1 ml of au0 2z for the reduction of mb and rhb and 50 μl of it for mo and cr fig 10 e displays how does the reduction of dyes progress with time and fig 10 f displays the plot between ln c0 c and time for organic dyes reduction using au0 2z as a catalyst in addition the kinetic study was performed by applying l h model eqs 1 and 2 to the reduction of the dyes because the concentration of organic dyes was very small as compared to that of nabh4 in all the experiments the k app values were calculated from graph between ln c0 c and time table 5 for mo 7 86 10 3 s 1 mb 6 64 10 3 s 1 cr 2 86 10 3 s 1 and rhb 9 22 10 4 s 1 their respective activity constant turn over number k values are 157 71 66 36 57 20 and 9 22 s 1 g 1 table 5 which indicated the ultrafast reduction of mo whereas rhb reduced slowly the control experiments without a catalyst for the reduction of all dyes as well as those in presence of zif 11 and au nps as a catalyst were also carried out and the uv visible spectra are shown in figs s12 s13 and s14 i and ii respectively and the observed results are compiled in tables s4 s5 and s6 respectively au nps reduced more efficiently all the dyes as compared to zif 11 within 30 min as compiled in table 6 whereas all the dyes were completely reduced by using composite au0 2z in much smaller time indicating the excellent catalytic efficacy of au0 2z further the reduction of organic dyes took place comparatively slowly than that of nitroaromatic compounds using au decorated zif 11 composite au0 2z as a catalyst but au0 2z displayed enhanced catalytic activity towards dyes compared to those of immobilized ag nps on the different supports viz ps eda agnp for mb 48 spag3 for cr 49 and agnps tan esm 50 and fe3o4 his ag 51 for mo furthermore au0 2z also exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitroaromatics as compared to ag nps anchored on carbon nanofibers 52 au naoparticles mil 100 fe and au ag nanoparticles mof 76 6 30 a comparison of the catalytic efficiency of the studied catalyst au0 2z with those of already reported similar materials table 7 for the reduction of 4 nitrophenol to 4 amnimophenol also indicated its high efficiency moreover the studied composite au0 2z reduced effectively 2 and 3 nitorphenols as well as 4 nitroaniline and picric acid it has been observed that the pxrd spectrum fig s1 c of the used composite au0 2z after five cycles for the reduction of 4 nphenol is similar to that of the as synthesized composite indicating its high stability the results indicated excellent usability of au0 2z towards the removal of several organic pollutants such as various nitroaromatic compounds and dyes 3 4 mechanistic insight for reduction reactions of nitro aromatics and organic dyes to understand the mechanism involved in reducing nitroaromatic compounds let us consider a representative reduction reaction i e 4 nphenol to 4 aphenol using nabh4 as a reducing agent it is well understood fact that reduction of 4 nphenol to 4 aphenol by nabh4 strong reducing agent is extremely difficult and long process despite of its thermodynamic feasibility under atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions e0 4 nphenol 4 aphenol 0 76 v e0 h3bo3 bh4 1 33 v but kinetic factor is hindered and reaction takes place at very slow pace without a catalyst because of a huge potential gap between the bh4 electron donor and the nitro compound electron acceptor a large kinetic barrier exists to overcome the kinetic obstacle and efficiently pass electrons from bh4 to 4 nitrophenol noble metal nanoparticles viz ag ag au and ag au pd nanoparticles have been reported widely 46 53 56 herein the mechanism of the reduction reactions using au zif 11 au0 2z as a catalyst in presence of nabh4 is explained in terms of l h kinetic model 45 57 in the first step both bh4 and nitroaromatic compound are dispersed and simultaneously adsorbed on the catalytic active sites available on surface of au0 2z au zif 11 bh4 reacts with water to produce hydride ions which are quickly taken up by au nps present on surface of au0 2z then the reduction occurs by passing of hydrogen and electron from au nps to nitro group of the substrate reduction step is slower than the diffusion and adsorption desorption of bh4 and nitroaromatic compound on the active sites of au0 2z the decorated au nps onto zif 11 decreases the kinetic barrier for the reaction by acting as electron relays between donor bh4 and accepter nitroaromatic compound in other terms au0 2z reduces the activation energy required for reduction reactions in addition the rate determination step is the reaction between the adsorbed nitroaromatic compound to surface bound hydrogen atoms on au nanoparticles 57 as the final product an amino compound is desorbed from the catalyst surface and moves away from the active metal leaving au0 surface intact behind and the catalysis process will re start again the composite can be used with almost same efficiency up to 5 cycles scheme 1 depicts the probable mechanism for reducing 4 nitrophenol as a model example in the same manner organic dyes are also reduced by the facile hydrogen and electron transfer via au nps anchored onto zif 11 microcrystals methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb was reduced to leuco methylene blue lmb and leuco rhodamine b lrhb respectively methyl orange mo and congo red cr were degraded to much simpler amino molecules 4 conclusions this article provides a simple wet chemical process for the rapid single step decoration of widely dispersed round shape au nanoparticles onto zif 11 surface three different composites were synthesized and characterized all the composites reduced nitroaromatic compounds much more efficiently than zif 11 and au nps catalyst au0 2z acted excellently to reduce nitroaromatics and organic dyes the outstanding catalytic efficiency of as synthesized au zif 11 composite for the reduction of organic pollutants such as nitroaromatic compounds viz 2 nitophenol 4 nitrophenol 4 nani and picric acid and organic colouring dyes such as mo mb cr and rhb in aqueous medium at 25 1 c might be due to the successful immobilization of aunps on account of the electrostatic interactions between aunps and zif 11 large specific surface areas of aunps and aunps may also work as electron relay which facilitates the passing of electron from bh4 donor to substrate bearing nitro group or organic dyes acceptor the reduction process can be explained by l h kinetics model and k app and k values indicated the following catalytic order for reduction of 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 2 nphenol 4 nani picric acid the composite au0 2z is comparatively a little bit less effective for reduction of organic dyes and the reduction order follows mo mb cr rhb such composites can be used for the removal of organic pollutants as the efficient wastewater remediation declaration of competing interest authors declare that there is no competing financial interest acknowledgments the authors are grateful to

that au nanoparticles immobilized onto zif 11 may serve as antenna to transfer electrons and hydrogen from borohydride bh4 ions to the acceptor nitro group organic dye therefore au0 2z can effectively

au zif 11 composite efficiently reduced nitroaromatic compounds and organic dyes in very less time unlabelled image keywords au nps zif 11 heterogeneous catalysis nitrophenols organic colouring dyes 1 introduction the degradation of water quality is dangerously increasing and in the 21st century the challenge is enormous causing existential threats to biodiversity and multiple human populations and undermining economic progress and human life sustainability water pollution is mainly due to the offloading of untreated effluents of various industries into the aquatic bodies organic pollutants such as organic colouring dyes mb rhb cr and mo and highly stable nitroaromatic compounds viz 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol and picric acid are extremely harmful to aquatic life as well as to human textile industry s residual waters containing colouring dyes increase the levels of oxygen demand both biochemical bod and chemical cod these dyes have high solubility and stability in water and impart intense colour into the aqueous systems at even ppm levels thus changing the optical properties of water and it has adverse effects on aesthetic quality clarity and water gas solubility 1 the light penetration depth decreases with increasing the concentration of dye or toxic agent in water which reduces the photosynthesis process and lowers the formation of planktons that are a crucial source of food for marine animals 2 the anaerobic biodegradability of dyes is exceptionally low and highly carcinogenic compounds are produced upon their anaerobic biodegradation 3 which may also degrade human health nitrophenols as effluents with high solubility and stability from various industries producing pesticides herbicides and synthetic dyes have been declared as the major pollutants in the aqueous system by the environmental protection agency of united states due to their carcinogenic mutagenic and inhibitory properties however nitrophenols especially 4 nitrophenol 4 nphenol becomes a valuable substrate because 4 aminophenol 4 aphenol the final product obtained on reduction of 4 nphenol is a vital chemical used as a photographic developer corrosion inhibitor drying agent and as an intermediate in many industries such as dyes drugs and oil additives 4 5 now a days many attempts have now been made to design and build advanced multifunctional materials by sustainable procedures for the efficient treatment of industrial wastewater metal organic frameworks mofs are one of such type of functional materials an intriguing category of highly crystalline porous frameworks produced by self assembly of metal ions or clusters and organic linkers they possess extremely high surface area open metal sites and tailorable porosities 6 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zifs with varying topologies rho and sod have emerged as a very special subclass of mofs made of zinc or cobalt ion as metal part and imidazole its derivatives as ligands 7 zifs are highly thermally and chemically stable along with huge surface area and incredible porosity and can be utilized as an ideal candidate for a number of critical applications such as heterogeneous catalysts 8 supercapacitor 9 and in separation of gases 10 gas sensing 11 and drug delivery 12 zifs owing to their large surface area can be utilized to immobilize variety of metal oxides sulphides and nanoparticles which are prone to agglomerate and porous nature of zifs provides excellent platform to allow reactants substrates to adsorb and interact with each other recently tio2 cds sno2 wo3 zno sno2 and ag nanoparticles were encapsulated in zif 8 and their applications for photodegradation of organic pollutants were reported from our research group 13 19 au pd and pt nanoparticles were decorated on nanotube mof zif 8 and mil 101 for photocatalytic production of h2 ammonia borane hydrolysis aerobic alcohol oxidation coupling reactions and hydrogenation 20 21 among zifs zif 8 and zif 67 are extensively studied materials while other analogues of this class are not widely studied especially for organocatalytic applications zif 11 is another zeolitic imidazolate framework with rho topology with large pores 14 6 å and comparatively smaller pore apertures 3 0 å and it is widely used in gas separation in the last few years zif 11 polymer mixed matrix membranes mmms were fabricated for various gas separation viz fda dam zif 11 mmms for separation of co2 ch4 and h2 ch4 10 zif 11 pebax 2533 mmms for separation of h2 ch4 and h2 n2 22 zif 11 polyimide matrimid 23 zif 11 in pbi mmms 24 and zif 11 polybenzimidazole mmms 25 for separation of h2 and co2 during the last decade gold nanoparticles au nps are intensively investigated for several catalytic reactions such as co oxidation 26 methanol oxidation 27 cross coupling reactions 28 and 4 nphenol reduction 29 only three reports have been found on au ag nanoparticles loaded mofs such as au mil 100 fe 30 au ag on mof 76 6 and ag zif 7 31 used for reduction of 4 nitrophenol and a highly chemically and thermally stable zif 11 is yet to explore for the immobilization of catalytically active metallic nps like au ag pd and pt keeping this under consideration

c28h31cln2o lobachemie and methyl orange c14h14n3nao3s merck and sodium borohydride nabh4 merck were used as obtained all solutions were prepared in milli q water 2 2 synthesis of zif 11 one step crystallization procedure as reported earlier 23 was adopted for the production of zif 11 by dissolving benzimidazole 0 48 g 4 mmol into a mixture of solvents comprising methanol 12 8 g 800 mmol toluene 18 4 g 200 mmol and ammonium hydroxide 4 8 g 80 mmol zinc acetate dihydrate 0 44 g 2 mmol was completely dissolved in methanol 6 4 g 400 mmol in an ice bath both ligand and metal solutions were cooled down to 20 c next zinc metal solution was introduced to benzimidazole ligand solution dropwise with continuous stirring the stirring was resumed for another 3 h the white product was obtained by centrifugation for 15 min at 1000 rpm washed 4 times with methanol and kept in hot air oven at 120 c for 12 h for drying 2 3 synthesis of au zif 11 composites three different au zif 11 composites were produced by dissolving 100 mg of as prepared zif 11 and varying amounts of haucl4 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 mmol in 100 ml of milli q water and kept into an ultrasonic bath for 30 min then solution was kept in an ice bath to achieve 20 c followed by addition of 0 01 m solution of nabh4 1 ml 2 ml and 3 ml of nabh4 for 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 mmol of haucl4 respectively under continuous stirring the stirring was continued for 5 min the composites were recovered by centrifugation and washing was done with water and methanol then dried in a hot air oven at 60 c overnight the samples were represented as au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z based on the added amount of haucl4 2 4 catalytic activity of au zif 11 composites towards reduction of nitroaromatics the stock solutions 5 mm of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid were prepared in milli q water in an experimental set up of nitrophenol s reduction 100 μl 5 mm of nitroaromatic compound 1 ml of 0 04 m nabh4 and 2 ml of water were poured into a quartz cuvette the suspension of the catalyst was made by dispersing au0 2z 2 mg into 2 ml milli q water and sonicated for 30 min for 4 nphenol 3 nphenol 2 nphenol and p nani 50 μl of above suspension of au zif 11 utilized as a catalyst was introduced into the quartz cuvette and 100 μl of it was used for picric acid a transition in colour from pale yellow to bright yellow and then colourless was detected uv vis ultraviolet visible spectra were collected after each minute sometimes after every 30 s at ambient conditions 25 1 c 1 atm in a range of 200 700 nm all the reduction experiments were performed in triplicate 2 5 catalytic activity of au zif 11 composites towards reduction of organic dyes standard solutions of mb rhb cr and mo 1000 ppm were made separately for a typical reduction experiment of organic dyes 3 ml water 300 μl of nabh4 0 04 m and calculated volume of stock solution of dye were added to a quartz cuvette to produce final concentrations of 5 ppm of mo 10 ppm of mb 10 ppm of cr and 5 ppm of rhb with total volume of 3 35 ml 50 μl of au0 2z catalyst 1 mg per ml suspension was introduced as a catalyst for cr and mo while 100 μl of catalyst was used for mb and rhb the reduction was monitored by recording uv vis spectra per every 1 min in the 200 700 nm range at standard conditions 25 1 c 1 atm 2 6 catalytic reusability to recycle the catalyst the catalyst au0 2z was recovered after the completion of each catalytic reduction reaction the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min and catalyst was filtered washed and dried for next cycle fresh solution of nitroaromatic compound was taken and sonicated with recovered catalyst for 1 min to re disperse the catalyst followed by the addition of nabh4 solution to start the reaction which was monitored by noting absorbance with time pxrd of the used catalyst after 5 cycles was also recorded to ascertain its stability 2 7 instrumental techniques the details of procedures employed in various instrumental techniques and specifications of the corresponding instruments used for characterization of the materials are same as reported earlier 15 17 and summarized in the supporting file 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic aspect and characterization of zif 11 and composites au zif 11 zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with different phase compositions have been synthesized with slight change in the reaction conditions such as temperature and solvents and this has also been observed for zif 11 32 33 zif 11 has been synthesized through solvothermal process in n n diethylformamide def as a solvent the steric hindrance from 4th and 5th position of substituted imidazole ligand and amide solvent interaction was deemed to direct the topology of rho in zifs therefore the solvents used during zif 11 synthesis are limited to amide solvent def and dmf although the solvent s function not completely known because the dmf kinetic diameter 5 2 5 5 å is bigger than the rho type zifs pore size further the extraction of dmf from the pores of zif 11 is arduous procedure which restricts the further application of zif 11 particularly in gas separation and gas adsorption 34 in addition small quantities of water found in def can contribute to the formation of zif 7 iii impure phase along with zif 11 phase 32 35 when we look at the geometry of zif 11 the phim s four benzene units point inward into the ring and shape a flattened octagon the creation of flattened octagons is the key element in the formulation of wide cage zifs which can be realised by tempering with organic molecules another of the commonly recognized non covalent forces governing the biomolecular structure are the intermolecular π π interactions thus during the formation of rho type zif 11 toluene was taken as the template molecule and ammonium hydroxide facilitated deprotonation of imidazole ligand 34 methanol provides greater solubility of reactants and can be quickly separated from the zif 11 pores therefore we synthesized zif 11 by the interaction of imidazole and zinc acetate dihydrate in 2 1 molar ratio in a mixture of solvents such as methanol toluene ammonium hydroxide in 10 2 5 1 molar ratio 23 three samples of au zif 11 composite were prepared by adding 0 1 mm 0 2 mm 0 3 mm of haucl4 into the as synthesized zif 11 followed by the wet reduction of haucl4 using nabh4 0 01 m as a reducing agent powder x ray diffraction pxrd results confirmed the formation of zif 11 and au zif 11 fig 1 a d and fig s1 a the characteristic diffraction peaks in zif 11 fig 1 a at 2θ angle of 6 11 7 53 8 95 9 76 12 32 13 06 13 80 15 74 16 94 18 49 corresponded to 200 211 220 310 400 330 420 510 521 and 600 planes respectively with cubic pm3 m space group and are in near with the values reported previously 33 36 very intense peaks of metallic au appeared in pxrd patterns of au0 1z fig 1 b au0 2z fig 1 c and au0 3z fig 1 d at 2θ angle of 38 18 44 39 64 57 77 54 and 81 72 matching to 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of cubic phase of gold having fm3m space group matched with jcpds 04 0784 37 the peaks of zif 11 can be clearly seen in all composites on the lower side of 2θ see inset in fig 1 b d this explicitly verified the distribution of au0 over zif 11 after the complete reduction of haucl4 and no other diffraction peaks for any impurity was found the crystallite size of au nanoparticles 18 46 nm was calculated by debye scherrer formula using highest intensity peak at 2θ angle of 38 18 corresponding to au 111 plane further decoration of au nps onto zif 11 was examined by several techniques as discussed below fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of zif 11 au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z are illustrated in fig s1 b characteristic absorption peaks of zif 11 micro crystals were observed at 3082 3067 3033 cm 1 aromatics stretching and 1610 and 1465 cm 1 for cc of benzimidazole ring stretching additional peaks at 1287 cm 1 benzimidazole ring breathing and 1244 cm 1 for ch deformation in plane of benzimidazole ring were also observed sharp bands at 1180 1118 910 and 774 cm 1 were observed for benzimidazole bending in plane ch nh ch out of plane bending and imidazole ring bending respectively 38 all the peaks of zif 11 appeared in ftir spectra of au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z without the appearance of any other new peak a small shift in the stretching frequency of nh is observed zif 11 υ nh at 1111 cm 1 while in au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z υ nh at 1118 cm 1 this may be due to donor accepter type of behaviour between an electron deficient au atom and an electron rich n atom 39 the full scan surface xps and the expanded xps spectra of all constituent s atoms with their orbitals of zif 11 and au0 2z are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively and those of au0 1z and au0 3z are displayed in figs s2 and s3 respectively presence of all non hydrogen constituents elements c n and zn was detected in full scan xps spectra of zif 11 the modest intensity xps peaks corresponding to zn 2p3 2 and zn 3p1 2 were present at binding energy of 1022 04 ev and 1044 8 ev respectively low intensity peaks at 10 51 89 30 and 140 48 ev corresponding to zn 3d5 2 zn 3p3 2 and zn 1s respectively were also identified expanded and deconvoluted spectra of zn 2p is shown in fig 2 b and the similar patterns are observed in au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z composites fig s2 b fig 3 b and fig s3 b an intense peak at 284 87 ev matching with c 1s appeared in zif 11 fig 2 c whereas c 1s appeared with small variation in binding energy values in au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z fig s2 c fig 3 c and fig s3 c a moderate intensity peak appeared at 399 05 ev corresponding to n 1s was also detected in all the composites with slight deviation from that of zif 11 and the deconvoluted spectra are depicted in fig 2 d fig s2 d fig 3 d and fig s3 d this may be due to some sorts of interaction between au nanoparticles facing towards the imidazole n of zif 11 matrix in addition to the xps peaks of zn 3p n 1s and c 1s four sharp and very intense peaks corresponding to au 4d3 2 au 4d5 2 au 4f5 2 and au 4f7 2 were also observed at binding energy of 354 85 336 85 88 34 and 84 88 ev respectively in au0 2z fig 3 a and e 40 41 and these peaks are also present in au0 1z and au0 3z and the corresponding expanded spectra of au 4f are depicted in figs s2 e and s3 e table 1 summarizes the results of xps the morphological study of zif 11 and au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z composites were conducted by fesem and tem hrtem regular rhombic dodecahedron shaped microcrystals of zif 11 are shown in fig 4 a and au nanoparticles immobilized on zif 11 in composites are shown in fig 4 b d indicating no variation in morphology of zif 11 after loading au nps on the surface of zif 11 furthermore tem image fig 5 a of au0 2z also revealed the intact morphology and formation of au nanoparticles on zif 11 micro crystals the tem picture fig 5 b illustrated nano sized au particle anchored on zif 11 the interplanar spacing d spacing of gold nanoparticles in hrtem image fig 5 c was 0 23 nm corresponding to au 111 plane which is in good agreement with d spacing calculated by pxrd the saed pattern displaying various crystal planes from au nanoparticles established its polycrystalline nature fig 5 d and the mean particle size measured by employing imagej software was 7 35 0 95 nm fig s4 the porosities and surface areas of zif 11 and its composites were studied using bet n2 adsorption desorption fig 6 and n2 sorption isotherms fig 7 at 77 k and the results are given in table 2 zif 11 displayed a surface area of 608 78 m2 g 1 and it further decreased to 34 89 m2 g 1 72 02 m2 g 1 and 59 64 m2 g 1 respectively for au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z fig 6 these results again confirmed that au nanoparticles deposition on zif 11 surface prevents immediate accessibility to zif 11 pores additionally the distribution of pore size fig s5 and pore volume were also determined the mean pore size of zif 11 au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z was 36 21 å 37 92 å 38 28 å and 38 60 å respectively table 2 fig s5 the observed bet surface area 608 78 m2 g 1 of zif 11 is higher than that 392 m2 g 1 observed previously for zif 11 synthesized from anhydrous zncl2 and benzimidazole in methanol toluene mixture 33 indicating that surface properties also depend upon the methodology used further the observed value is in close agreement with that 605 11 m2 g 1 reported by morris et al 42 whereas park et al 36 reported 1676 0 m2 g 1 from computational molecular dynamics simulation n2 sorption isotherms of zif 11 and its composites showed type i profile fig 7 which suggest the permanent micro porosity and it was found to be in good agreement with the earlier studies on zif 11 33 36 42 the open end adsorption desorption nitrogen hysteresis characteristic of standard microporous material with high surface area was observed and gate opening behaviour similar to that in zif 7 was seen 42 although the average pore size zif 11 is very large but the pore aperture size is just 3 0 å due to the existence of the side ring on the imidazole ligand while the kinetic diameter of n2 molecule is 3 6 å and hence the n2 uptake in lower relative pressure range is low 33 42 when the relative pressure exceeded the gate opening pressure in the case of as synthesized zif 11 p p0 0 052 a gradual rise in n2 absorption is observed which continued with increase in relative pressure the benzimidazole ligand rotational motion and interaction between zif 11 network and n2 gas molecules led to the swelling of pore openings elastic deformations thereby allowing the adsorption of larger molecules than expected 33 36 43 44 similar behaviour was found in all three composites and a substantial reduction was found in pore volume the pore volume for zif 11 reduced from 0 4329 cm3 g 1 to 0 0414 cm3 g 1 0 0668 cm3 g 1 and 0 0655 cm3 g 1 for au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z respectively indicating that au nanoparticles covered zif 11 microcrystal pores table 2 3 2 catalytic activity of au zif 11 composites for reduction of nitroaromatic compounds nabh4 can reduce 4 nphenol and this reaction is thermodynamically feasible because δe0 of the reaction is greater than zero e0 4 nphenol 4 ap 0 76 v and e0 h3bo3 bh4 1 33 v δe0 0 67 v but its kinetic feasibility decreases owing to the substantial potential gap between nabh4 donor and 4 nphenol acceptor molecules 45 completion time for the reduction of 4 nphenol without any catalyst was investigated by liao et al and it was 32 h indicating exceptionally low kinetic feasibility of the reduction reaction of 4 nphenol 46 we studied the reduction of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid using zif 11 and its composites au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z as a catalyst the advancement of catalytic reduction reaction was observed by using uv vis spectrophotometer the aqueous solution of nitroaromatics shows light yellow colour which turns into intense yellow as nabh4 was added due to formation of the corresponding phenolate ions 4 nphenol has absorption maxima at 317 nm in aqueous solution which quickly shifts to 400 nm as soon as nabh4 was poured due to the transformation of 4 nphenol to 4 nitrophenolate ion 47 reduction reaction proceeds very slowly without any catalyst which can be monitored by a decline in the intensity of the peak at 400 nm with time and simultaneous increase in the intensity of a fresh peak at 298 nm due to the formation of the product i e 4 aminophenol likewise the reduction of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid was tracked by measuring a decrease in the intensity of the absorption peak at λmax of the corresponding phenolate ion at 414 388 380 and 388 nm respectively and concomitantly 2 nphenol transformed to 2 aminophenol 3 nphenol to 3 aminophenol and 4 nitroaniline to p phenylenediamine similarly 2 4 6 triaminophenol was obtained after the reduction of three nitro groups existing in picric acid the nabh4 concentration was kept quite high 0 04 m in each experiment considered as constant as compared to that of nitroaromatics 1 587 10 4 m such a control experiment was performed with each nitroaromatic compound using nabh4 0 04 m as a reducing agent and no catalyst was added to the reaction system fig s6 and table s1 negligible reduction was observed in case of 2 nphenol 7 90 3 nphenol 4 11 and 4 nphenol 5 04 whereas 4 nani 24 30 and picric acid 36 08 reduced significantly within 15 min in addition it was found that after 15 min the colour of the picric acid solution remained yellow instead of colourless fig s7 similar experiments were performed using zif 11 as a catalyst and the results are presented in fig s8 and table s2 a marginal decrease 2 35 to 3 46 within 15 min in the efficiency of zif 11 for the catalytic reduction of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol and 4 nphenol was accomplished whereas a large decrease was observed in case of 4 nani 5 55 reduction was observed as compared to 24 30 without zif 11 this may be partly due to some sorts of interactions between the substrate ions and zn2 and partly due to porous nature of zif 11 on the other hand zif 11 enhanced the reduction of 2 4 6 trinitrophenol picric acid reduced 44 64 as compared to 36 08 in absence of zif 11 but the solution retained yellow colour fig s9 the reduction of all nitroaromatics using au nps as a catalyst in presence of nabh4 has also been investigated and the results are given in fig s10 i ii and table s3 au nps performed more effectively than zif 11 and within 15 min it reduced 64 67 of 2 nphenol 100 of 3 nphenol 66 52 of 4 nphenol 100 of 4 nani and 45 51 of picric acid and also reduced 94 19 of 2 nphenol and 92 12 of 4 nphenol within 35 and 30 min respectively whereas about 79 of picric acid was reduced within 40 min the catalytic reduction efficiency of au0 1z au0 2z and au0 3z using 50 μl of suspension containing 1 mg of catalyst in 1 ml was analysed against 4 nphenol as typical pollutant compound the catalytic reduction efficiency was quantitatively monitored by measuring the variations in the absorption peak s intensity at about 400 nm at the interval of 1 min just after the addition of the composite au0 1z au0 2z au0 3z fig 8 au0 1z achieved the complete 100 reduction within 6 min while au0 2z and au0 3z accomplished it within 3 min and 10 min respectively and therefore au0 2z was used for further reduction experiments of other nitroaromatic compounds further concomitant increase in the absorbance of the peak at 298 nm attributed to 4 aphenol was observed in fig 8 the isosbestic points show that no other side reaction had occurred all the three composites have been found to exhibit excellent catalytic efficiency as compared to zif 11 and au nps fig 9 a shows that composite au0 2z enhanced the complete catalytic conversion of 2 nphenol to 2 aphenol within 3 min while 3 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid have been converted to corresponding amino compounds in 1 5 and 12 min respectively fig 9 b d respectively a graph of c0 c vs time fig 9 e depicts the progress of reduction reaction with time the concentration of reducing agent nabh4 0 04 m was much larger than the substrate s concentration and therefore the rate of the reaction was considering to be dependent only on concentration of substrate the ln c c0 vs time was plotted and a straight line fig 9 f was obtained which clearly indicates that the langmuir hinshelwood l h apparent first order kinetics is applicable for the reduction reaction of substrate as given by eq 1 1 r dc dt kkc 1 kc r mg l 1 s 1 signifies rate of substrate s reduction c is substrate s concentration mg l 1 t is total time required to complete the reaction k mg l 1 s 1 represents the rate constant k l mg 1 stands for the adsorption coefficient of substrate if c0 starting concentration of the substrate is quite low then eq 1 may be written as 2 ln c c 0 k k t k app t where k app s 1 apparent first order rate constant the slope of the plot of ln c0 c vs time provides the values of k app which are presented in table 3 the k app for the reduction of 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid are 1 90 10 2 4 64 10 2 3 24 10 2 1 19 10 2 and 4 00 10 2 s 1 respectively activity constant turn over number k k app m where m is weight of catalyst in gram was determined to provide further understanding into the reduction process the calculated k values are 380 61 928 83 647 59 239 49 and 40 04 s 1 g 1 for 2 nphenol 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 4 nani and picric acid respectively the recyclic test for the catalyst was also performed and au0 2z showed high activity and reusability up to 5 cycles fig s11 further in comparison to zif 11 and au nps the composite au0 2z performed excellently and the rate of reduction is much faster with complete reduction in lesser time as given in table 4 3 3 catalytic activity of au zif 11 composites for reduction of organic colouring dyes the composite au0 2z was also explored for its catalytic efficiency for reduction reactions of conventional organic colouring dyes viz methylene blue mb methyl orange mo rhodamine b rhb and congo red cr assisted by sodium borohydride nabh4 as a reductant at ambient conditions progression of catalytic reduction of the studied dyes was observed by measuring a decline in absorbance fig 10 a d at λmax of the corresponding organic colouring dye mo λmax 464 nm cr 496 nm rhb 554 nm and mb 663 nm the studied organic dyes 5 to 10 ppm were completely decolourized within 7 to 57 min mo 5 ppm cr 10 ppm mb 10 ppm and rhb 5 ppm in 7 20 10 and 57 min respectively by employing 100 μl of a suspension containing 1 mg per 1 ml of au0 2z for the reduction of mb and rhb and 50 μl of it for mo and cr fig 10 e displays how does the reduction of dyes progress with time and fig 10 f displays the plot between ln c0 c and time for organic dyes reduction using au0 2z as a catalyst in addition the kinetic study was performed by applying l h model eqs 1 and 2 to the reduction of the dyes because the concentration of organic dyes was very small as compared to that of nabh4 in all the experiments the k app values were calculated from graph between ln c0 c and time table 5 for mo 7 86 10 3 s 1 mb 6 64 10 3 s 1 cr 2 86 10 3 s 1 and rhb 9 22 10 4 s 1 their respective activity constant turn over number k values are 157 71 66 36 57 20 and 9 22 s 1 g 1 table 5 which indicated the ultrafast reduction of mo whereas rhb reduced slowly the control experiments without a catalyst for the reduction of all dyes as well as those in presence of zif 11 and au nps as a catalyst were also carried out and the uv visible spectra are shown in figs s12 s13 and s14 i and ii respectively and the observed results are compiled in tables s4 s5 and s6 respectively au nps reduced more efficiently all the dyes as compared to zif 11 within 30 min as compiled in table 6 whereas all the dyes were completely reduced by using composite au0 2z in much smaller time indicating the excellent catalytic efficacy of au0 2z further the reduction of organic dyes took place comparatively slowly than that of nitroaromatic compounds using au decorated zif 11 composite au0 2z as a catalyst but au0 2z displayed enhanced catalytic activity towards dyes compared to those of immobilized ag nps on the different supports viz ps eda agnp for mb 48 spag3 for cr 49 and agnps tan esm 50 and fe3o4 his ag 51 for mo furthermore au0 2z also exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitroaromatics as compared to ag nps anchored on carbon nanofibers 52 au naoparticles mil 100 fe and au ag nanoparticles mof 76 6 30 a comparison of the catalytic efficiency of the studied catalyst au0 2z with those of already reported similar materials table 7 for the reduction of 4 nitrophenol to 4 amnimophenol also indicated its high efficiency moreover the studied composite au0 2z reduced effectively 2 and 3 nitorphenols as well as 4 nitroaniline and picric acid it has been observed that the pxrd spectrum fig s1 c of the used composite au0 2z after five cycles for the reduction of 4 nphenol is similar to that of the as synthesized composite indicating its high stability the results indicated excellent usability of au0 2z towards the removal of several organic pollutants such as various nitroaromatic compounds and dyes 3 4 mechanistic insight for reduction reactions of nitro aromatics and organic dyes to understand the mechanism involved in reducing nitroaromatic compounds let us consider a representative reduction reaction i e 4 nphenol to 4 aphenol using nabh4 as a reducing agent it is well understood fact that reduction of 4 nphenol to 4 aphenol by nabh4 strong reducing agent is extremely difficult and long process despite of its thermodynamic feasibility under atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions e0 4 nphenol 4 aphenol 0 76 v e0 h3bo3 bh4 1 33 v but kinetic factor is hindered and reaction takes place at very slow pace without a catalyst because of a huge potential gap between the bh4 electron donor and the nitro compound electron acceptor a large kinetic barrier exists to overcome the kinetic obstacle and efficiently pass electrons from bh4 to 4 nitrophenol noble metal nanoparticles viz ag ag au and ag au pd nanoparticles have been reported widely 46 53 56 herein the mechanism of the reduction reactions using au zif 11 au0 2z as a catalyst in presence of nabh4 is explained in terms of l h kinetic model 45 57 in the first step both bh4 and nitroaromatic compound are dispersed and simultaneously adsorbed on the catalytic active sites available on surface of au0 2z au zif 11 bh4 reacts with water to produce hydride ions which are quickly taken up by au nps present on surface of au0 2z then the reduction occurs by passing of hydrogen and electron from au nps to nitro group of the substrate reduction step is slower than the diffusion and adsorption desorption of bh4 and nitroaromatic compound on the active sites of au0 2z the decorated au nps onto zif 11 decreases the kinetic barrier for the reaction by acting as electron relays between donor bh4 and accepter nitroaromatic compound in other terms au0 2z reduces the activation energy required for reduction reactions in addition the rate determination step is the reaction between the adsorbed nitroaromatic compound to surface bound hydrogen atoms on au nanoparticles 57 as the final product an amino compound is desorbed from the catalyst surface and moves away from the active metal leaving au0 surface intact behind and the catalysis process will re start again the composite can be used with almost same efficiency up to 5 cycles scheme 1 depicts the probable mechanism for reducing 4 nitrophenol as a model example in the same manner organic dyes are also reduced by the facile hydrogen and electron transfer via au nps anchored onto zif 11 microcrystals methylene blue mb and rhodamine b rhb was reduced to leuco methylene blue lmb and leuco rhodamine b lrhb respectively methyl orange mo and congo red cr were degraded to much simpler amino molecules 4 conclusions this article provides a simple wet chemical process for the rapid single step decoration of widely dispersed round shape au nanoparticles onto zif 11 surface three different composites were synthesized and characterized all the composites reduced nitroaromatic compounds much more efficiently than zif 11 and au nps catalyst au0 2z acted excellently to reduce nitroaromatics and organic dyes the outstanding catalytic efficiency of as synthesized au zif 11 composite for the reduction of organic pollutants such as nitroaromatic compounds viz 2 nitophenol 4 nitrophenol 4 nani and picric acid and organic colouring dyes such as mo mb cr and rhb in aqueous medium at 25 1 c might be due to the successful immobilization of aunps on account of the electrostatic interactions between aunps and zif 11 large specific surface areas of aunps and aunps may also work as electron relay which facilitates the passing of electron from bh4 donor to substrate bearing nitro group or organic dyes acceptor the reduction process can be explained by l h kinetics model and k app and k values indicated the following catalytic order for reduction of 3 nphenol 4 nphenol 2 nphenol 4 nani picric acid the composite au0 2z is comparatively a little bit less effective for reduction of organic dyes and the reduction order follows mo mb cr rhb such composites can be used for the removal of organic pollutants as the efficient wastewater remediation declaration of competing interest authors declare that there is no competing financial interest acknowledgments the authors are grateful to

ag 3 0 42 ag 2 0 21 or ag 1 0 11 was added into the mixture and stirred for further 30 min then each mixture was transferred into a 250 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 c for 24 h finally the mixture was cooled to room temperature centrifuged and washed with deionized water and ethanol to obtain a residual solid the latter was dried at 80 c for 4 h and finally calcined at 500 c for 3 h in a muffle furnace to obtain the ag doped tio2 nano catalyst designated as ag t4 ag t3 ag t2 and ag t1 for 0 85 0 42 0 21 and 0 11 doping concentration respectively a control sample of tio2 without silver nitrate solution was also prepared and subjected to the afore mentioned procedure 2 2 characterization the absorption spectra and band gap of the samples were

added to 100ml of 10 mg l tartrazine solution in a 200 ml beaker and stirred in the dark for 1 h to attain the adsorption desorption equilibrium the suspension was irradiated using hal 350 solar simulator with compact xenon light source two milliliter aliquots were collected at different time intervals and then filtered with a microspore syringe filter 0 45 μm to remove the photocatalysts the

solutions of the scavengers i e ipa aa and fa 0 5 ml 0 001 m were added separately into the beakers containing 100 ml 10 ppm ta afterwards the resulting mixture was subjected to the same conditions as those without scavengers 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and degradation studies the results of the optical characterization of the pristine and ag doped tio2 revealed narrow and broad absorption bands between 200 400 and 400 800 nm for tio2 and ag doped tio2 nanoparticles respectively fig 1a these bands corresponded to the energy band gap of 3 19 ev 389 nm 3 16 ev 393 nm 3 18 ev 390 nm 3 15 ev 394 nm and 3 19 ev 389 nm respectively fig 1b as shown in fig 1a b the optimum doping concentration with the best visible light absorption was 12 5 mm corresponding to the ag t2 0 21 nano catalyst the representative edx spectrum and corresponding elemental mapping of the nano catalyst 0 21 are shown in fig 1c according to fig 1c the nano catalyst consisted of ti o and ag at 41 0 39 1 and 0 1 respectively confirming the successful doping of titanium oxide with silver however as shown in the inset of fig 1c the elemental mapping was unable to detect the presence of ag probably due to its low concentration the presence of c in the spectrum existed as a result of the carbon tape used as a sample holder during analysis inset fig 1c the ftir analysis showed o hstr 3442 cm 1 ohbend 1635 cm 1 and ti ostr band between 485 and 800 cm 1 fig 2a as the major functional groups on the doped samples the lower transmittance corresponding to higher absorbance and absence of distortion observed at lower doping concentrations was further observed in the comparative raman spectra of the nanomaterials fig 2b as shown in fig 2b the red shift effect of the 2 eg peak at higher doping concentration ag t4 disappeared as the concentration reduced from ag t4 0 85 to ag t1 0 11 with ag t2 0 21 showing the highest intensity the xrd patterns of the as synthesized samples indicated that all diffraction peaks corresponded to the anatase phase of tio2 jcpsd card no 00 064 0863 fig 2c the result from the tem showed that doping caused a reduction in the average particle size from 13

first order rate constant of 8 38 10 3 s 1 also there is no significant change in the performance of the agt2 catalyst for up to a 5 cycle of reusability 10 change fig 3d the better performance of the ag t2 over other materials was associated with its better visible light absorption as well as smaller particle size fig 1a and fig s1a f supplementary material table 1 shows the comparison of the present work with some previous literature reports as shown in the table the present work showed better performance and sustainable characteristics lower doping or lesser material requirement than those reported 3 2 effect of dosage and scanvenger s trapping the results of the degradation of ta in the presence of different dosages of photocatalyst 0 21 ag t2 are shown in fig 4a according to fig 4a 30 mg dosage resulted in the highest removal efficiency 87 while 10 20 40 and 50 mg exhibited 36 51 78 and 81 respectively to understand the reactive oxygen species ros responsible for the degradation the trapping experiments were done using different scavengers viz formic acid fa ascorbic acid aa and isopropyl alcohol ipa as shown in fig 4b c the highest photodegradation was seen in the absence of the scavengers when the fa or aa was added into the solution the photocatalytic activity was slightly reduced implying little contribution from hole or superoxide radical however the addition of ipa made a significant reduction in the photodegradation indicating hydroxyl radical as the dominant ros species 4 conclusion the photocatalytic activities of ag doped tio2 nanoparticles were evaluated towards the degradation of tartrazine in water the results showed that the nano catalyst doped with the 0 21 silver ion exhibited the highest degradation performance removing 87 of the dye in 180 min the higher performance at lower doping concentration was related to higher absorption of the visible light and smaller particle size the material can be used for 5 cycles without

cycle to check its stability the dosage of the nano catalyst with the best properties was varied from 10 to 50 mg to obtain dosage with optimized performance 2 4 scavenger trapping experiment the solutions of the scavengers i e ipa aa and fa 0 5 ml 0 001 m were added separately into the beakers containing 100 ml 10 ppm ta afterwards the resulting mixture was subjected to the same conditions as those without scavengers 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and degradation studies the results of the optical characterization of the pristine and ag doped tio2 revealed narrow and broad absorption bands between 200 400 and 400 800 nm for tio2 and ag doped tio2 nanoparticles respectively fig 1a these bands corresponded to the energy band gap of 3 19 ev 389 nm 3 16 ev 393 nm 3 18 ev 390 nm 3 15 ev 394 nm and 3 19 ev 389 nm respectively fig 1b as shown in fig 1a b the optimum doping concentration with the best visible light absorption was 12 5 mm corresponding to the ag t2 0 21 nano catalyst the representative edx spectrum and corresponding elemental mapping of the nano catalyst 0 21 are shown in fig 1c according to fig 1c the nano catalyst consisted of ti o and ag at 41 0 39 1 and 0 1 respectively confirming the successful doping of titanium oxide with silver however as shown in the inset of fig 1c the elemental mapping was unable to detect the presence of ag probably due to its low concentration the presence of c in the spectrum existed as a result of the carbon tape used as a sample holder during analysis inset fig 1c the ftir analysis showed o hstr 3442 cm 1 ohbend 1635 cm 1 and ti ostr band between 485 and 800 cm 1 fig 2a as the major functional groups on the doped samples the lower transmittance corresponding to higher absorbance and absence of distortion observed at lower doping concentrations was further observed in the comparative raman spectra of the nanomaterials fig 2b as shown in fig 2b the red shift effect of the 2 eg peak at higher doping concentration ag t4 disappeared as the concentration reduced from ag t4 0 85 to ag t1 0 11 with ag t2 0 21 showing the highest intensity the xrd patterns of the as synthesized samples indicated that all diffraction peaks corresponded to the anatase phase of tio2 jcpsd card no 00 064 0863 fig 2c the result from the tem showed that doping caused a reduction in the average particle size from 13 61 to 12 60 for pure tio2 and ag t2 respectively fig 2d and fig s1a f supplementary material the bet analysis showed a surface area of 65 74 m2g 1 for the representative sample of 0 21 ag t2 fig s2 supplementary material the results of the photocatalytic performances of the nanomaterials are shown in fig 3a c as shown in fig 3a c the ag t2 exhibited the highest removal of ta 87 with an apparent first order rate constant of 8 38 10 3 s 1 also there is no significant change in the performance of the agt2 catalyst for up to a 5 cycle of reusability 10 change fig 3d the better performance of the ag t2 over other materials was associated with its better visible light absorption as well as smaller particle size fig 1a and fig s1a f supplementary material table 1 shows the comparison of the present work with some previous literature reports as shown in the table the present work showed better performance and sustainable characteristics lower doping or lesser material requirement than those reported 3 2 effect of dosage and scanvenger s trapping the results of the degradation of ta in the presence of different dosages of photocatalyst 0 21 ag t2 are shown in fig 4a according to fig 4a 30 mg dosage resulted in the highest removal efficiency 87 while 10 20 40 and 50 mg exhibited 36 51 78 and 81 respectively to understand the reactive oxygen species ros responsible for the degradation the trapping experiments were done using different scavengers viz formic acid fa ascorbic acid aa and isopropyl alcohol ipa as shown in fig 4b c the highest photodegradation was seen in the absence of the scavengers when the fa or aa was added into the solution the photocatalytic activity was slightly reduced implying little contribution from hole or superoxide radical however the addition of ipa made a significant reduction in the photodegradation indicating hydroxyl radical as the dominant ros species 4 conclusion the photocatalytic activities of ag doped tio2 nanoparticles were evaluated towards the degradation of tartrazine in water the results showed that the nano catalyst doped with the 0 21 silver ion exhibited the highest degradation performance removing 87 of the dye in 180 min the higher performance at lower doping concentration was related to higher absorption of the visible light and smaller particle size the material can be used for 5 cycles without

13282,bank filtration bf for water treatment presents a limited efficiency due to clogging this columns study ran for 34 days and was intended to evaluate biological clogging by using homogeneous and poorly graded filter material and different grain sizes in parallel filtered water quality and hydraulic parameters were monitored daily to show the clogging process s effect on these parameters pvc columns were filled with fine sand d10 0 16 mm medium sand d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm fluorescein diacetate fda and triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc were used to estimate microbiological activity in the filter media and their results were compared to organic matter content and dissolved oxygen concentration it was observed a greater hydraulic conductivity k10 reduction of 98 and greater content of fluorescein 10 68 μg g 1 dehydrogenase 1 86 μg g 1 h 1 and organic matter 0 13 in the first 5 cm of the filter media by using fine sand as filter material followed by medium and coarse sand fluorescein and dehydrogenase accumulated concentrations were greater at coarse sand 4 80 μg g 1 and 1 075 μg g 1 h 1 respectively followed by medium and fine sand homogeneous filter media with higher specific porosity favors the presence and distribution of organic fractions and enzymatic activity at greater depths enzymatic activity seems to be limited by nutrient availability and dissolved oxygen concentration biological clogging seems to be influenced by factors such as grain size distribution and hydrodynamic effects fda and ttc showed to be an interesting tool for biological clogging monitoring at bank filtration sites graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water treatment hydraulic conductivity enzymatic activity fluorescein diacetate fda triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc 1 introduction human and industrial development creates a growing demand for water treatment technologies 1 in this scenario a range of purification methods can remove contaminants such as membrane separation 1 3 adsorption techniques 4 and bank filtration bf bf technique has shown a substantial efficiency in water quality improvements of surface and groundwater 5 8 it has been used in europe for more than 100 years and spread worldwide mainly because it is the most cost effective surface water treatment adsorption techniques and bank filtration bf bf technique provides the infiltration of water from the river lake through the sediments directly to the production well 9 these systems remove several contaminants such as organic micro pollutants nutrients microbial pathogens and heavy metals 8 the mechanisms involved in the water treatment process are deeply connected to hydrogeochemical characteristics from the site including sediment nature and its physical aspects 10 11 an intrinsic factor of bf is the porosity decrease due to the clogging process at the bank of rivers lakes which function as filter media 12 these conditions vary according to the filtration rate applied during pumping and sediment characteristics besides biotic and abiotic factors 11 13 14 clogging interferes with water production efficiency resulting in higher energy costs during pumping due to head loss increase 11 14 cleaning of the clogged layer occurs naturally through precipitation wind action river flow variation microbiological activity and other ways modifying the sediment arrangement 15 the clogging process may occur externally and internally in the sediment bank the first one occurs due to the retention of suspended particles and a thick clogged layer on the sediment surface internal clogging occurs through the breakthrough of suspended particles at greater depths of sediment bank 14 16 17 there are four types of clogging physical through inert fine solid particles 18 biological through biomass divided between microorganisms and organic particles 16 17 chemical through precipitation of chemical compounds according to biotic and abiotic alterations 19 21 and mechanical due to formation of biochemical activities gases 10 17 during filtration microbiological presence plays an essential role in the degradation of contaminants 22 been considered part of the future technology for drinking water treatment 23 however it can lead to hydraulic conductivity decrease of the filter media due to its role in the clogging process 13 the porosity reduction caused by bioclogging is related to cell and extracellular polymeric substances eps 24 the determination of microbiological presence in soil 25 27 marine sediments 28 29 membrane bioreactor 30 and sludge 31 by using fluorescein diacetate fda and triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc methodologies are known these can determine the enzymes activity of esterases and dehydrogenases respectively reflecting the microbiological presence and degradation process in depth studies within the bf technique considering the role that the sediment grain size distribution and grain shape represent in the clogging scenario have been performed 10 12 14 although specific biological dynamics in fine to middle coarse sandy materials under infiltration processes are unknown 32 positive results of applying fda and ttc techniques for total microbiological presence determination are expressed in the literature however there are very few studies on bf and microbiological presence assessment using fda or ttc methodologies divided into water sampling 33 34 and sediment sampling 35 37 to our knowledge the enzymatic approach for assessing biological clogging and corresponding head loss increase on bf technology was not explored before therefore this study intends to investigate biological clogging through esterases fda and dehydrogenases ttc activities and the effect of the clogging process on water quality and hydraulics considering main parameters this approach used homogeneous and poorly graded sand as a filter material and different grain sizes in columns simulating bf systems the proposal explores the possibility of the methods supporting decision makers when installing bf systems and monitoring for a potential biological clogging point of view 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and filtration system this research took place in the rio grande do sul brazil between february and march 2020 at the federal university of santa maria ufsm campus frederico westphalen the water used in the study was collected from a small dam inside the university through continuous pumping schneider bcr 2010v the small lake formed by the dam has approximately 264 m2 and around 2 m depth afterward raw water was led through a pipe to a constant hydraulic head tank installed above the columns in the laboratory to ease turbulence effects caused by raw water pumping fig 1 the columns system operated in a descending flow and declining rate 1 94e 4 m s 1 in order to evaluate the effect of different grain sizes on clogging process the columns were filled in triplicate with the following filter media fine sand d10 0 16 mm medium sand d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm the previously material preparation occurred in the lab by drying at 105 c for 24 h afterward a sieving analysis was then performed 38 coefficients of curvature cc and non uniformity nuc indicate a poorly graded and homogenous filter media theoretical values of hydraulic conductivity of the filters material were estimated according to hazen 10 and total and effective porosity through sens et al 15 the characterization of the samples is detailed in table 1 vertical pvc columns with 100 mm diameter were used to simulate this infiltration study it is considered that the first centimeters of water infiltration through the sediments occur majorly in a vertical flow form also another flow direction could provide a preferential path considering gravity forces clean and dry crushed rock 1 2 to 1 9 mm was previously prepared in the lab through sieving analysis and used to fill the bottom of the columns to avoid loss of the filter material slowly the filter media was inserted inside the columns manually in layers of 2 cm approximately compaction of the filter material every 2 cm using a wooden pestle was realized with small beats on the sides of the columns aiming the constitution of a constant density material along the columns at the same time distilled water was inserted in an upward direction to expel imprisoned air bubbles inside the filter material the filling of the columns was interrupted when filter media reached 30 cm height 10 three 50 liter capacity constant hydraulic head tanks above the system continuously fed the filtration columns the tanks were not hydraulically connected to them inside the filtration columns the hydraulic head was set 50 cm above the filter material controlled by an overflow system attached to the columns fig 1 filtered water was guided by a flexible pipe installed in the bottom of the columns until the outflow it was applied an initial infiltration rate of 1 94e 4 m s 1 in all the columns four piezometers were distributed at different depths to evaluate the head loss in the filter media 2 2 hydraulic and water quality monitoring daily registers of system hydraulic conductivity were taken the experiment was interrupted when hydraulic conductivity presented stability which expresses the balance of the clogging process the system operated for 34 days uninterruptedly darcy s law was used to calculate hydraulic conductivity 10 seq 1 in the equation k is hydraulic conductivity in m s 1 q represents water flow in m3 s 1 i is an adimensional hydraulic gradient originated from the division of hydraulic head in m and the length of interest in m a represents the transversal area of the column in m2 hydraulic conductivity values were adjusted for viscosity conditions at 10 c 39 to ease the temperature effects using a viscosity and temperature table 40 these hydraulic conductivity adjustments resulted in k10 values 1 k q i a daily analyses of raw and filtered water quality were conducted since the experiment started the water parameters analyzed corresponded to turbidity hach 2100q apparent and true color hach dr900 and gn 6 metricel membrane from pall corporation electrical conductivity hach hq40d and cdc401 dissolved oxygen hach hq40d and ldo101 ph hach hq40d and phc101 and temperature hach hq40d and phc101 the analyses were performed according to apha 41 the water quality data obtained during the monitoring were analyzed statistically through the analysis of variance anova and the tukey test to determine the differentiation of the resulting means according to the grain sizes of filter media 2 3 enzymatic and organic analysis at the experiment s ends the columns were slowly and carefully drained through the opening of a register localized in the bottom of the columns the columns were then opened and the filter media was collected by scraping at the depths of 0 to 2 cm 2 to 4 cm 4 to 6 cm 6 to 8 cm 8 to 10 cm 10 to 15 cm 15 to 20 cm and 20 to 30 cm fluorescein diacetate fda 25 and triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc methods 42 provided enzymatic activity evaluation the methodologies of fda and ttc were applied in each layer of the filter media with some adjustments for applying the process of fda analysis 2 g of drained filter media were weighed in an analytical balance prix as220 and put inside falcon tubes of 50 ml also 15 ml of potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 6 was added and afterward 0 2 ml of the solution of 1000 μg fda ml 1 to start the reaction the samples were analyzed in triplicate and the blank sample did not receive fda substrate the tubes were closed agitated and after 20 min at 25 c 15 ml of chloroform methanol were added inside the fume cupboard to interrupt the hydrolysis process the tubes were closed intensely agitated and centrifuged at 2000 rev min 1 for 3 min excelsa ii 206bl the supernatant was filtered in qualitative filter paper j prolab and analyzed in a spectrophotometer specord 50 plus analytik jena at 490 nm the calculation of the produced fluorescein concentration used the generated calibration curve with standards of 0 to 5 μg fluorescein ml 1 the results were expressed in terms of fluorescein in μg g 1 of dry sand the detection limit dl of the method corresponded to1 74e 1 μg ml 1 43 according to the triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc methodology the weighting of 5 g of drained filters media is performed in test tubes using an analytical balance afterward triplicated samples received 5 ml of ttc 0 1 subtract solution and 5 ml of tris buffer ph 7 6 solution in the three blank samples being this stage and the following ones protected from light exposure the tubes were sealed agitated and incubated at 25 c for 16 h next each sample received 25 ml of acetone all of them kept in the absence of light for 2 h the samples were agitated as soon as the acetone was added after 1 h and again after 2 h finally the samples were filtered in qualitative filter paper j prolab and analyzed in a spectrophotometer specord 50 plus analytik jena at 485 nm to determine the tpf triphenylformazan concentration the tpf concentration released in the samples of filter media was calculated according to the equation of the method 42 expressing the result of dehydrogenase activity at μg g 1 of sand per hour the detection limit dl of the method corresponded to 2 97e 5 μg ml 1 43 to the final equation of the ttc method it is necessary to determine the sample humidity thus humidity analysis of the samples went by weighing 20 g of filter media in triplicate using porcelain crucibles and dried in the oven at 110 c around 20 h 44 after weighing the dried samples they were put in the muffle oven where they stayed at 500 c for 6 h providing the equation of organic matter content 25 the results obtained from the filter media samples collected at different depths and analyzed regarding the organic matter content fluorescein concentration and dehydrogenase concentration was processed statically through the analysis of variance anova the tukey test and the pearson correlation analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic aspects of the clogging process after a few hours of operation a significant decrease of infiltration rates and hydraulic conductivity k10 after adjustments regarding water viscosity developed in all columns until getting approximately stable in the beginning the high infiltration rate applied in the system provided hydrodynamic forces increase towards the porous media 45 47 causing an accelerated internal clogging 10 however all of the filter media presented external clogging the homogeneity and the poorly graded filter material can facilitate the transport of fine particles in greater depths 10 14 45 3 1 1 infiltration rate fine sand d10 0 16 mm corresponded to the filter media with greater sensitivity to the clogging process which presented an infiltration rate decrease of 1 1 log at the end of the experiment equivalent to a loss of 92 of initial conditions 1 94e 4 to 1 61e 5 m s 1 according to fig 2 a b medium sand d10 0 44 mm presented an intermediate clogging process among the used filter media there was a infiltration rate reduction of 0 9 log equivalent to 88 1 94e 4 to 2 38e 5 m s 1 coarse sand d10 1 33 mm presented the lower infiltration rates reduction among the column systems corresponding to 0 7 log at the end of the experiment and equivalent to an 82 to the initial conditions 1 94e 4 to 3 51e 5 m s 1 from the point of view of filtered water volume produced according to the infiltration rate smaller grain sizes correspond to less favorable treatment conditions in comparison larger grain sizes present the disadvantage of clogging in depth due to the more significant interstitial space between grains 10 conditions of internal clogging at bank filtration bf sites frequently cannot be reverted becoming an unfavorable issue in a long term perspective 3 1 2 hydraulic conductivity due to the smaller void space between the grains the thinner filter media d10 0 16 mm exhibited lower initial k10 for all depths fig 3 a c at the end of the experiment the clogging process showed to be more relevant at the layer from 0 to 5 cm in fine sand d10 0 16 mm as filter media fig 3 d the superficial clogging represents a reduction of 1 8 log 2 17e 6 m s 1 equivalent to a k10 loss of 98 concerning the beginning the loss of k10 observed in the layer stands out among all the filter media the smaller porous space of fine sand provides an external and accelerated clogging process between 5 and 20 cm there was a decrease of only 0 02 log 8 84e 5 m s 1 and between 20 and 30 cm no significant reduction was observed 1 19e 4 m s 1 it means that internal clogging in the columns filled with fine sand was not substantial from the hydraulic point of view in similar studies soares 10 also showed a more significant loss of k10 in the first 10 cm of the filter material composed of fine and homogeneous sand d10 0 3 mm with no significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity in greater depth the medium filter material d10 0 44 mm indicated a k10 reduction between 0 and 5 cm fig 3 a c which corresponds to 1 2 log 5 61e 5 m s 1 establishing a loss of 94 to the initial hydraulic conductivity fig 3 d between 5 and 20 cm there was no k10 reduction 9 41e 4 m s 1 in 20 to 30 cm there was a k10 reduction corresponding to 0 3 log at the end of the experiment 4 64e 4 m s 1 declogging activities possibly caused hydraulic conductivity oscillation in the medium sand d10 0 44 mm more intensely approaching the hydraulic behavior of the coarse sand d10 1 33 mm in several moments higher values of k10 where obtained in coarse sand d10 1 33 mm fig 3 larger grains generally express greater values of hydraulic conductivity in saturated media 17 contributing to a slow and deep clogging process a slow clogging process is favorable for water production but internal clogging can compromise the system in the long term cleaning of the clogged layer by natural processes is not likely to happen in greater depths at the end of the experiment it presented a k10 reduction at the layer 0 to 5 cm equivalent to 1 2 log 3 91e 4 m s 1 establishing a reduction of 93 to the initial one fig 3 d at the intermediate layer 5 to 20 cm there was a decrease of 0 6 log 2 03e 3 m s 1 and between 20 and 30 cm the reduction reached 0 4 log 4 61e 3 m s 1 due to the larger grain size of filter media coarse sand presented a clogging process between 5 and 30 cm depth establishing internal clogging the greater interstitial space between grains of larger size allows the clogging to occur in greater depth since the deposited suspended solids have greater mobility in the filter media 10 concerning the hydraulic conductivity oscillation observed mainly in medium d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm a more intense internal clogging was noticed possibly because of the influence of the capture and detachment dynamics of particles in the filter media complementary there could also have been an influence of temperature to accelerate biodegradation processes 48 which can lead to the opening of the pore space in the systems in the first 5 cm of the filter media happened the greatest k10 reduction at fine sand 1 8 log d10 0 16 mm medium sand 1 2 log d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand 1 2 log d10 1 33 mm consequently the layer presents itself as the most active in the interception and deposition of particles in the homogeneous and poorly graded filter material as noted the smaller the particle size of the filter media the greater the interception of particles in the first few centimeters in the porous media coarse sand d10 1 33 mm stood out at the total clogging represented by k10 reduction considering the entire 30 cm depth filter media this media showed an accumulated hydraulic conductivity decrease of 2 2 log followed by fine 1 82 log d10 0 16 mm and medium sand 1 5 log d10 0 44 mm the filter material with a larger grain size presented itself as the most active in the process of particles retention in depth to smaller grain sizes 3 2 water quality the filter media characteristics influence the treatment efficiency the variations of water quality parameters are shown in fig 4 and table 2 at physical aspects the results indicate a reduction of solids in filtered water there was less concentration of turbidity apparent color and true color in the columns filled with fine sand d10 0 16 mm followed by medium sand d10 1 33 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm statistical analysis α 0 05 shows significantly lower levels of turbidity produced by fine d10 0 16 mm and medium sand d10 0 44 mm if compared to coarse sand d10 1 33 mm there was a significant difference in the treatment between the columns filled with coarse and fine sand at apparent color medium sand d10 0 44 mm had a similar performance as fine sand d10 0 16 mm in turbidity and apparent color there was not a significant difference observed between the treatments regarding true color reduction according to the turbidity and apparent color results fine sand d10 0 16 mm is more efficient in solids retention in the filter media and consequently less susceptible to a breakthrough of particles to filtered water the efficiency in the retention of particles caused by the smaller particle size is related to the possibility of a higher organic matter content accumulated in the filter media this performance is directly attributed to the grain size distribution of the systems filter media 14 the lower capacity of medium d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm in suspended particles retention may be caused by the more significant interstitial space between the grains this aspect is related to the absence of a significant difference between the systems about apparent color suggesting dissolved particles transport through the filter media also in homogeneous filter media the transport of fine particles in depth is favored 10 14 45 according to ph electric conductivity and temperature data there was no significant difference between the treatments α 0 05 variations were observed on a small scale although constant ph levels were identified in raw water due to natural processes like precipitation leaching of natural compounds dilution and organic activity despite the variations the ph mean remained around 7 in raw water and filtered water the ph close to neutrality is usually the most favorable for the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms the water electric conductivity increase at bank filtration bf sites may be influenced by characteristics of the local filter media due to the natural geological nature of the site or due to the influence of groundwater when there is hydraulic communication between the surface and groundwater 49 however in this experiment the sand used corresponds to an inert nature being the raw water the only variation factor entering the system this way the parameter change can be attributed to precipitation events influencing raw water quality considering the possible leaching of natural metallic compounds 50 due to the flow paths at bf sites the water temperature will adopt the temperature of the sediment environment 10 48 ideally filtered water temperature should be as close to superficial water temperature as possible to avoid reactions of gas formation and precipitations which can cause mechanical clogging in the bank sediment 51 the dissolved oxygen in filtered water suffered significant alterations α 0 05 in all the columns the fine sand filter media d10 0 16 mm presented the lowest mean of dissolved oxygen followed by medium d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm chemical and biological activities occurring in the filter material can influence oxygen presence in a bf scenario dissolved oxygen in filtered water tends to show lower levels than surface water regarding underground percolation during many days and the microbiological consumption 52 the lowest dissolved oxygen concentration in the columns filled with fine sand d10 0 16 mm can be associated with the fact they have a punctual clogging zone concentrated in the first few centimeters of the filter media with a more notable reduction in hydraulic conductivity medium sand d10 0 44 mm presented more significant interstitial space between the grains than fine sand contributing to the higher stability of dissolved oxygen transport along the column coarse sand d10 1 33 mm on the other hand kept the highest dissolved oxygen mean among grain sizes the higher porosity of the filter media possibly contributed to oxygen transport along the column 3 3 biological clogging organic matter content and enzymatic activity influence the hydraulic conductivity reduction due to porosity decrease in the utilized filter materials caused by biological clogging 17 53 organic matter content and enzymatic activity varied by each media grain size table 3 the enzymatic activity results indicate the efficiency of both techniques assessing biological clogging in bank filtration bf simulation systems it was observed higher organic matter concentration retained in the columns filled with fine sand d10 0 16 mm followed by coarse d10 1 33 mm and medium sand d10 0 44 mm a significant difference α 0 05 in the organic matter retention in medium sand to fine and coarse sand was also observed regarding the enzymatic activity there was a higher concentration of fluorescein and dehydrogenase in coarse sand d10 1 33 mm followed by medium d10 0 44 mm and fine sand d10 0 16 mm however a significant difference α 0 05 in enzymatic activity among the filter media was not observed the sediments analysis available in the literature 35 37 indicates that bf sites exhibit higher esterase and dehydrogenase activity within a more significant period of operation due to the larger scale of organic accumulation and related processes one of them in lake tegel enzymatic activity fluorescein dehydrogenase in sediments indicated complex dependencies with temperature carbon presence nutrition load seasonality and structural organizations of microorganisms 36 37 in the rhône river high seasonal variations in fluorescein concentration at 20 cm of depth occurred in the hyporheic zone and the shore decreasing over depth the investigation showed a positive correlation between fluorescein total organic matter concentration persistent dissolved organic carbon and bacterial abundance 35 in this study pearson s correlation with a 95 of confidence level indicated a positive moderate and significant correlation among the aspects of organic matter fluorescein and dehydrogenase table 3 taylor et al 26 pointed out a high correlation between the dehydrogenase activity and other measurements of bacteriological abundances such as viable cell count direct count the relation of biomass carbon and dna wolińska and stepniewska 54 and kumar 55 also established a positive correlation in which the existence of total organic carbon toc influences the presence of enzymatic activity quantitative and qualitatively in the hyporheic zone of river and lake banks the interstitial habitat of the first layer of sediment usually presents a higher nutrient concentration organic matter availability and bacteria abundance 35 56 in this study the first layer of all filter media types used in the columns presented the highest concentration of retained organic particles fluorescein and dehydrogenase as well as a higher hydraulic conductivity decrease fig 5 it may represent the presence of bacteria and fungus which usually compose a more significant part of the biofilm formed on the surfaces of the grains and remain attached and active in the degradation and transformation of the organic matter providing nutrients for all the trophic levels of the system 57 59 the first centimeters of filter media correspond to higher fluorescein and dehydrogenase release layers due to subtracts degradation it means high microbiological activity resulting from the suspended particles retention process and microbiological growth due to dissolved oxygen and nutrient availability fig 5 a c as a result a significant hydraulic conductivity decrease was observed in the first 5 cm of the filter media in the columns establishing external clogging related to the biological presence fig 5 d e in lake tegel a bf site indicated greater enzymatic activity in the first 5 cm of sediment sand regarding dehydrogenase about 12 μg g 1 h 1 and fluorescein about 40 μg g 1 decreasing along with depth 36 37 in a bf site in rhône river fluorescein analysis indicated a significant decrease regarding enzymatic activities in depth considering 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm and from the river hyporheic zone to the shore 35 biofilm formation happens more intensely in smaller grain sizes due to the greater grain contact area according to the porosity and fluid velocity percolation smaller grains collect fine particles of organic material usually associated with higher organic matter retention 10 17 56 fine and coarse sand promotes significant biofilm formation in the upper layer which is much slower in coarse sand 60 the shear stress limits biofilm growth due to the fluid flow through the porous media 61 62 and the increase of hydrodynamic forces intensifies the transport of particles to higher filter media depths 45 leading to internal clogging the balance between detachment and biomass increase is one reason that makes it possible to reach stability 60 while the media depth increases organic matter availability and enzymatic activity fluorescein and dehydrogenase decrease the depth element presents itself as a limiting factor once the greater microbiologic abundance is in the upper layer of natural soils 54 55 due to reasons already mentioned it was observed a significant difference α 0 05 between the first layer 0 2 cm and the rest of the filter media when fine d10 0 16 mm and medium sand d10 0 44 mm are used filter material composed by coarse sand presented a significant difference in depth only regarding the enzymatic activity presented by fluorescein and the first 2 cm depth differed from the rest α 0 05 3 4 oxygen mobility aspects and nutrient availability dissolved oxygen and particulate organic matter transport can structure the organisms spatial distribution in the pore space and aggregated formations 63 also the oscillations of organic matter content and enzymatic activity at different filter media depths are caused by the organic fractions mobility in the columns due to hydrodynamic forces and homogeneity of the filter media 60 62 nutrient and dissolved oxygen mobility through the filter media is favored by the larger grain sizes fig 6 possibly leading to a higher enzymatic activity observed in coarse d10 1 33 mm and medium sand d10 0 44 mm when compared to fine sand d10 0 16 mm fine sand d10 0 16 mm even retaining a higher amount of organic matter may have presented limitations in dissolved oxygen and nutrient distribution along the column reflecting a lower enzymatic activity medium sand d10 0 44 mm had the lowest concentration of retained organic matter which may have been the limiting factor in enzymatic activity once it has presented more esterase and dehydrogenase activities than fine sand d10 0 16 mm but even then a lower activity than coarse sand d10 1 33 mm coarse sand d10 1 33 mm presented a higher concentration of retained organic matter than medium sand d10 0 44 mm in addition to a greater dissolved oxygen transport through the porous media which may have directly influenced the highest enzymatic activities means registered although there are some limitations in dehydrogenase activity that must be considered in the overview the dehydrogenases are characterized by intracellular actions which means that they oxidize the substrate endogenously differently from the esterases fluorescein formers which act freely and are also attached to the microorganisms cells the dehydrogenase activity may be underestimated due to competition with other hydrogen acceptors in the filter media 26 regarding the oxygen presence it is pointed that the dehydrogenase enzymes present activity in aerobic and anaerobic environments 64 though recent studies say there is an inverse relation between dehydrogenase and oxygen availability being the dehydrogenase potentialized in environments where oxygen concentration is reduced 54 65 on the other hand the fluorescein release activity is described in aerobic 66 and anaerobic environments 29 even though the methods consider different enzymes activity in distinct microbiological processes the results in this study showed similar behavior in terms of organic degradation and the positive correlation observed in their presence both methods showed microbiological activity and biological clogging in bf simulation systems as a monitoring tool the need to determine influent aspects in enzymatic activity such as nutrients and oxygen presence constitutes the next step 37 4 conclusions both methods fda and ttc proved to be useful for biological clogging investigations in bank filtration sites established as a tool for monitoring also homogeneous and poorly graded filter media indicated a potential expansion of the biological clogging process at different depths in this scenario different questions guided the used grain sizes regarding the clogging process establishing the following considerations there is greater retention of particulate organic material in homogeneous filter media of smaller grain sizes which leads to an external biological clogging process as the grain size increases the particle retention starts to occur externally and internally once there is greater porous space for the act of particle retention mechanisms homogeneous filter media favors internal clogging reflecting a diffuse distribution of organic particles in depth also greater grain sizes lead to slower clogging processes than smaller grain sizes which show less filtration rate decline over time homogeneous filter media of smaller grain sizes points to greater removal of water pollutants represented by turbidity apparent and true color while the lowest efficiency is attributed to homogeneous filter material of greater grain sizes external clogging presented expressively in all the grain sizes of the filter media has the organic matter accumulation correlated to the greater enzymatic activity by esterases and dehydrogenases thus biological clogging is intimately linked to the reduction of hydraulic conductivity mainly from surface layers of the filter media the enzymatic activity by esterases and dehydrogenases has depth as a limiting factor possibly conditioned by the dissolved oxygen and nutrient transport existing in each filter media in this scenario homogeneous filter media with greater grain size tend to have more intense enzymatic activity possibly due to the greater dissolved oxygen and nutrient transport in larger pore spaces declaration of competing interest the authors

13282,bank filtration bf for water treatment presents a limited efficiency due to clogging this columns study ran for 34 days and was intended to evaluate biological clogging by using homogeneous and poorly graded filter material and different grain sizes in parallel filtered water quality and hydraulic parameters were monitored daily to show the clogging process s effect on these parameters pvc columns were filled with fine sand d10 0 16 mm medium sand d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm fluorescein diacetate fda and triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc were used to estimate microbiological activity in the filter media and their results were compared to organic matter content and dissolved oxygen concentration it was observed a greater hydraulic conductivity k10 reduction of 98 and greater content of fluorescein 10 68 μg g 1 dehydrogenase 1 86 μg g 1 h 1 and organic matter 0 13 in the first 5 cm of the filter media by using fine sand as filter material followed by medium and coarse sand fluorescein and dehydrogenase accumulated concentrations were greater at coarse sand 4 80 μg g 1 and 1 075 μg g 1 h 1 respectively followed by medium and fine sand homogeneous filter media with higher specific porosity favors the presence and distribution of organic fractions and enzymatic activity at greater depths enzymatic activity seems to be limited by nutrient availability and dissolved oxygen concentration biological clogging seems to be influenced by factors such as grain size distribution and hydrodynamic effects fda and ttc showed to be an interesting tool for

triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc 1 introduction human and industrial development creates a growing demand for water treatment technologies 1 in this scenario a range of purification methods can remove contaminants such as membrane separation 1 3 adsorption techniques 4 and bank filtration bf bf technique has shown a substantial efficiency in water quality improvements of surface and groundwater 5 8 it has been used in europe for more than 100 years and spread worldwide mainly because it is the most cost effective surface water treatment adsorption techniques and bank filtration bf bf technique provides the infiltration of water from the river lake through the sediments directly to the production well 9 these systems remove several contaminants such as organic micro pollutants nutrients microbial pathogens and heavy metals 8 the mechanisms involved in the water treatment process are deeply connected to hydrogeochemical characteristics from the site including sediment nature and its physical aspects 10 11 an intrinsic factor of bf is the porosity decrease due to the clogging process at the bank of rivers lakes which function as filter media 12 these conditions vary according to the filtration rate applied during pumping and sediment characteristics besides biotic and abiotic factors 11 13 14 clogging interferes with water production efficiency resulting in higher energy costs during pumping due to head loss increase 11 14 cleaning of the clogged layer occurs naturally through precipitation wind action river flow variation microbiological activity and other ways modifying the sediment arrangement 15 the clogging process may occur externally and internally in the sediment bank the first one occurs due to the retention of suspended particles and a thick clogged layer on the sediment surface internal clogging occurs through the breakthrough of suspended particles at greater depths of sediment bank 14 16 17 there are four types of clogging physical through inert fine solid particles 18 biological through biomass divided between microorganisms and organic particles 16 17 chemical through precipitation of chemical compounds according to biotic and abiotic alterations 19 21 and mechanical due to formation of biochemical activities gases 10 17 during filtration microbiological presence plays an essential role in the degradation of contaminants 22 been considered part of the future technology for drinking water treatment 23 however it can lead to hydraulic conductivity decrease of the filter media due to its role in the clogging process 13 the porosity reduction caused by bioclogging is related to cell and extracellular polymeric substances eps 24 the determination of microbiological presence in soil 25 27 marine sediments 28 29 membrane bioreactor 30 and sludge 31 by using fluorescein diacetate fda and triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc methodologies are known these can determine the enzymes activity of esterases and dehydrogenases respectively reflecting the microbiological presence and degradation process in depth studies within the bf technique considering the role that the sediment grain size distribution and grain shape represent in the clogging scenario have been performed 10 12 14 although specific biological dynamics in fine to middle coarse sandy materials under infiltration processes are unknown 32 positive results of applying fda and ttc techniques for total microbiological presence determination are expressed in the literature however there are very few studies on bf and microbiological presence assessment using fda or ttc methodologies divided into water sampling 33 34 and sediment sampling 35 37 to our knowledge the enzymatic approach for assessing biological clogging and corresponding head loss increase on bf technology was not explored before therefore this study intends to investigate biological clogging through esterases fda and dehydrogenases ttc activities and the effect of the clogging process on water quality and hydraulics considering main parameters this approach used homogeneous and poorly graded sand as a filter material and different grain sizes in columns simulating bf systems the proposal explores the possibility of the methods supporting decision makers when installing bf systems and monitoring for a potential biological clogging point of view 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and filtration system this research took place in the rio grande do sul brazil between february and march 2020 at the federal university of santa maria ufsm campus frederico westphalen the water used in the study was collected from a small dam inside the university through continuous pumping schneider bcr 2010v the small lake formed by the dam has approximately 264 m2 and around 2 m depth afterward raw water was led through a pipe to a constant hydraulic head tank installed above the columns in the laboratory to ease turbulence effects caused by raw water pumping fig 1 the columns system operated in a descending flow and declining rate 1 94e 4 m s 1 in order to evaluate the effect of different grain sizes on clogging process the columns were filled in triplicate with the following filter media fine sand d10 0 16 mm medium sand d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm the previously material preparation occurred in the lab by drying at 105 c for 24 h afterward a sieving analysis was then performed 38 coefficients of curvature cc and non uniformity nuc indicate a poorly graded and homogenous filter media theoretical values of hydraulic conductivity of the filters material were estimated according to hazen 10 and total and effective porosity through sens et al 15 the characterization of the samples is detailed in table 1 vertical pvc columns with 100 mm diameter were used to simulate this infiltration study it is considered that the first centimeters of water infiltration through the sediments occur majorly in a vertical flow form also another flow direction could provide a preferential path considering gravity forces clean and dry crushed rock 1 2 to 1 9 mm was previously prepared in the lab through sieving analysis and used to fill the bottom of the columns to avoid loss of the filter material slowly the filter media was inserted inside the columns manually in layers of 2 cm approximately compaction of the filter material every 2 cm using a wooden pestle was realized with small beats on the sides of the columns aiming the constitution of a constant density material along the columns at the same time distilled water was inserted in an upward direction to expel imprisoned air bubbles inside the filter material the filling of the columns was interrupted when filter media reached 30 cm height 10 three 50 liter capacity constant hydraulic head tanks above the system continuously fed the filtration columns the tanks were not hydraulically connected to them inside the filtration columns the hydraulic head was set 50 cm above the filter material controlled by an overflow system attached to the columns fig 1 filtered water was guided by a flexible pipe installed in the bottom of the columns until the outflow it was applied an initial infiltration rate of 1 94e 4 m s 1 in all the columns four piezometers were distributed at different depths to evaluate the head loss in the filter media 2 2 hydraulic and water quality monitoring daily registers of system hydraulic conductivity were taken the experiment was interrupted when hydraulic conductivity presented stability which expresses the balance of the clogging process the system operated for 34 days uninterruptedly darcy s law was used to calculate hydraulic conductivity 10 seq 1 in the equation k is hydraulic conductivity in m s 1 q represents water flow in m3 s 1 i is an adimensional hydraulic gradient originated from the division of hydraulic head in m and the length of interest in m a represents the transversal area of the column in m2 hydraulic conductivity values were adjusted for viscosity conditions at 10 c 39 to ease the temperature effects using a viscosity and temperature table 40 these hydraulic conductivity adjustments resulted in k10 values 1 k q i a daily analyses of raw and filtered water quality were conducted since the experiment started the water parameters analyzed corresponded to turbidity hach 2100q apparent and true color hach dr900 and gn 6 metricel membrane from pall corporation electrical conductivity hach hq40d and cdc401 dissolved oxygen hach hq40d and ldo101 ph hach hq40d and phc101 and temperature hach hq40d and phc101 the analyses were performed according to apha 41 the water quality data obtained during the monitoring were analyzed statistically through the analysis of variance anova and the tukey test to determine the differentiation of the resulting means according to the grain sizes of filter media 2 3 enzymatic and organic analysis at the experiment s ends the columns were slowly and carefully drained through the opening of a register localized in the bottom of the columns the columns were then opened and the filter media was collected by scraping at the depths of 0 to 2 cm 2 to 4 cm 4 to 6 cm 6 to 8 cm 8 to 10 cm 10 to 15 cm 15 to 20 cm and 20 to 30 cm fluorescein diacetate fda 25 and triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc methods 42 provided enzymatic activity evaluation the methodologies of fda and ttc were applied in each layer of the filter media with some adjustments for applying the process of fda analysis 2 g of drained filter media were weighed in an analytical balance prix as220 and put inside falcon tubes of 50 ml also 15 ml of potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 6 was added and afterward 0 2 ml of the solution of 1000 μg fda ml 1 to start the reaction the samples were analyzed in triplicate and the blank sample did not receive fda substrate the tubes were closed agitated and after 20 min at 25 c 15 ml of chloroform methanol were added inside the fume cupboard to interrupt the hydrolysis process the tubes were closed intensely agitated and centrifuged at 2000 rev min 1 for 3 min excelsa ii 206bl the supernatant was filtered in qualitative filter paper j prolab and analyzed in a spectrophotometer specord 50 plus analytik jena at 490 nm the calculation of the produced fluorescein concentration used the generated calibration curve with standards of 0 to 5 μg fluorescein ml 1 the results were expressed in terms of fluorescein in μg g 1 of dry sand the detection limit dl of the method corresponded to1 74e 1 μg ml 1 43 according to the triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc methodology the weighting of 5 g of drained filters media is performed in test tubes using an analytical balance afterward triplicated samples received 5 ml of ttc 0 1 subtract solution and 5 ml of tris buffer ph 7 6 solution in the three blank samples being this stage and the following ones protected from light exposure the tubes were sealed agitated and incubated at 25 c for 16 h next each sample received 25 ml of acetone all of them kept in the absence of light for 2 h the samples were agitated as soon as the acetone was added after 1 h and again after 2 h finally the samples were filtered in qualitative filter paper j prolab and analyzed in a spectrophotometer specord 50 plus analytik jena at 485 nm to determine the tpf triphenylformazan concentration the tpf concentration released in the samples of filter media was calculated according to the equation of the method 42 expressing the result of dehydrogenase activity at μg g 1 of sand per hour the detection limit dl of the method corresponded to 2 97e 5 μg ml 1 43 to the final equation of the ttc method it is necessary to determine the sample humidity thus humidity analysis of the samples went by weighing 20 g of filter media in triplicate using porcelain crucibles and dried in the oven at 110 c around 20 h 44 after weighing the dried samples they were put in the muffle oven where they stayed at 500 c for 6 h providing the equation of organic matter content 25 the results obtained from the filter media samples collected at different depths and analyzed regarding the organic matter content fluorescein concentration and dehydrogenase concentration was processed statically through the analysis of variance anova the tukey test and the pearson correlation analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic aspects of the clogging process after a few hours of operation a significant decrease of infiltration rates and hydraulic conductivity k10 after adjustments regarding water viscosity developed in all columns until getting approximately stable in the beginning the high infiltration rate applied in the system provided hydrodynamic forces increase towards the porous media 45 47 causing an accelerated internal clogging 10 however all of the filter media presented external clogging the homogeneity and the poorly graded filter material can facilitate the transport of fine particles in greater depths 10 14 45 3 1 1 infiltration rate fine sand d10 0 16 mm corresponded to the filter media with greater sensitivity to the clogging process which presented an infiltration rate decrease of 1 1 log at the end of the experiment equivalent to a loss of 92 of initial conditions 1 94e 4 to 1 61e 5 m s 1 according to fig 2 a b medium sand d10 0 44 mm presented an intermediate clogging process among the used filter media there was a infiltration rate reduction of 0 9 log equivalent to 88 1 94e 4 to 2 38e 5 m s 1 coarse sand d10 1 33 mm presented the lower infiltration rates reduction among the column systems corresponding to 0 7 log at the end of the experiment and equivalent to an 82 to the initial conditions 1 94e 4 to 3 51e 5 m s 1 from the point of view of filtered water volume produced according to the infiltration rate smaller grain sizes correspond to less favorable treatment conditions in comparison larger grain sizes present the disadvantage of clogging in depth due to the more significant interstitial space between grains 10 conditions of internal clogging at bank filtration bf sites frequently cannot be reverted becoming an unfavorable issue in a long term perspective 3 1 2 hydraulic conductivity due to the smaller void space between the grains the thinner filter media d10 0 16 mm exhibited lower initial k10 for all depths fig 3 a c at the end of the experiment the clogging process showed to be more relevant at the layer from 0 to 5 cm in fine sand d10 0 16 mm as filter media fig 3 d the superficial clogging represents a reduction of 1 8 log 2 17e 6 m s 1 equivalent to a k10 loss of 98 concerning the beginning the loss of k10 observed in the layer stands out among all the filter media the smaller porous space of fine sand provides an external and accelerated clogging process between 5 and 20 cm there was a decrease of only 0 02 log 8 84e 5 m s 1 and between 20 and 30 cm no significant reduction was observed 1 19e 4 m s 1 it means that internal clogging in the columns filled with fine sand was not substantial from the hydraulic point of view in similar studies soares 10 also showed a more significant loss of k10 in the first 10 cm of the filter material composed of fine and homogeneous sand d10 0 3 mm with no significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity in greater depth the medium filter material d10 0 44 mm indicated a k10 reduction between 0 and 5 cm fig 3 a c which corresponds to 1 2 log 5 61e 5 m s 1 establishing a loss of 94 to the initial hydraulic conductivity fig 3 d between 5 and 20 cm there was no k10 reduction 9 41e 4 m s 1 in 20 to 30 cm there was a k10 reduction corresponding to 0 3 log at the end of the experiment 4 64e 4 m s 1 declogging activities possibly caused hydraulic conductivity oscillation in the medium sand d10 0 44 mm more intensely approaching the hydraulic behavior of the coarse sand d10 1 33 mm in several moments higher values of k10 where obtained in coarse sand d10 1 33 mm fig 3 larger grains generally express greater values of hydraulic conductivity in saturated media 17 contributing to a slow and deep clogging process a slow clogging process is favorable for water production but internal clogging can compromise the system in the long term cleaning of the clogged layer by natural processes is not likely to happen in greater depths at the end of the experiment it presented a k10 reduction at the layer 0 to 5 cm equivalent to 1 2 log 3 91e 4 m s 1 establishing a reduction of 93 to the initial one fig 3 d at the intermediate layer 5 to 20 cm there was a decrease of 0 6 log 2 03e 3 m s 1 and between 20 and 30 cm the reduction reached 0 4 log 4 61e 3 m s 1 due to the larger grain size of filter media coarse sand presented a clogging process between 5 and 30 cm depth establishing internal clogging the greater interstitial space between grains of larger size allows the clogging to occur in greater depth since the deposited suspended solids have greater mobility in the filter media 10 concerning the hydraulic conductivity oscillation observed mainly in medium d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm a more intense internal clogging was noticed possibly because of the influence of the capture and detachment dynamics of particles in the filter media complementary there could also have been an influence of temperature to accelerate biodegradation processes 48 which can lead to the opening of the pore space in the systems in the first 5 cm of the filter media happened the greatest k10 reduction at fine sand 1 8 log d10 0 16 mm medium sand 1 2 log d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand 1 2 log d10 1 33 mm consequently the layer presents itself as the most active in the interception and deposition of particles in the homogeneous and poorly graded filter material as noted the smaller the particle size of the filter media the greater the interception of particles in the first few centimeters in the porous media coarse sand d10 1 33 mm stood out at the total clogging represented by k10 reduction considering the entire 30 cm depth filter media this media showed an accumulated hydraulic conductivity decrease of 2 2 log followed by fine 1 82 log d10 0 16 mm and medium sand 1 5 log d10 0 44 mm the filter material with a larger grain size presented itself as the most active in the process of particles retention in depth to smaller grain sizes 3 2 water quality the filter media characteristics influence the treatment efficiency the variations of water quality parameters are shown in fig 4 and table 2 at physical aspects the results indicate a reduction of solids in filtered water there was less concentration of turbidity apparent color and true color in the columns filled with fine sand d10 0 16 mm followed by medium sand d10 1 33 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm statistical analysis α 0 05 shows significantly lower levels of turbidity produced by fine d10 0 16 mm and medium sand d10 0 44 mm if compared to coarse sand d10 1 33 mm there was a significant difference in the treatment between the columns filled with coarse and fine sand at apparent color medium sand d10 0 44 mm had a similar performance as fine sand d10 0 16 mm in turbidity and apparent color there was not a significant difference observed between the treatments regarding true color reduction according to the turbidity and apparent color results fine sand d10 0 16 mm is more efficient in solids retention in the filter media and consequently less susceptible to a breakthrough of particles to filtered water the efficiency in the retention of particles caused by the smaller particle size is related to the possibility of a higher organic matter content accumulated in the filter media this performance is directly attributed to the grain size distribution of the systems filter media 14 the lower capacity of medium d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm in suspended particles retention may be caused by the more significant interstitial space between the grains this aspect is related to the absence of a significant difference between the systems about apparent color suggesting dissolved particles transport through the filter media also in homogeneous filter media the transport of fine particles in depth is favored 10 14 45 according to ph electric conductivity and temperature data there was no significant difference between the treatments α 0 05 variations were observed on a small scale although constant ph levels were identified in raw water due to natural processes like precipitation leaching of natural compounds dilution and organic activity despite the variations the ph mean remained around 7 in raw water and filtered water the ph close to neutrality is usually the most favorable for the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms the water electric conductivity increase at bank filtration bf sites may be influenced by characteristics of the local filter media due to the natural geological nature of the site or due to the influence of groundwater when there is hydraulic communication between the surface and groundwater 49 however in this experiment the sand used corresponds to an inert nature being the raw water the only variation factor entering the system this way the parameter change can be attributed to precipitation events influencing raw water quality considering the possible leaching of natural metallic compounds 50 due to the flow paths at bf sites the water temperature will adopt the temperature of the sediment environment 10 48 ideally filtered water temperature should be as close to superficial water temperature as possible to avoid reactions of gas formation and precipitations which can cause mechanical clogging in the bank sediment 51 the dissolved oxygen in filtered water suffered significant alterations α 0 05 in all the columns the fine sand filter media d10 0 16 mm presented the lowest mean of dissolved oxygen followed by medium d10 0 44 mm and coarse sand d10 1 33 mm chemical and biological activities occurring in the filter material can influence oxygen presence in a bf scenario dissolved oxygen in filtered water tends to show lower levels than surface water regarding underground percolation during many days and the microbiological consumption 52 the lowest dissolved oxygen concentration in the columns filled with fine sand d10 0 16 mm can be associated with the fact they have a punctual clogging zone concentrated in the first few centimeters of the filter media with a more notable reduction in hydraulic conductivity medium sand d10 0 44 mm presented more significant interstitial space between the grains than fine sand contributing to the higher stability of dissolved oxygen transport along the column coarse sand d10 1 33 mm on the other hand kept the highest dissolved oxygen mean among grain sizes the higher porosity of the filter media possibly contributed to oxygen transport along the column 3 3 biological clogging organic matter content and enzymatic activity influence the hydraulic conductivity reduction due to porosity decrease in the utilized filter materials caused by biological clogging 17 53 organic matter content and enzymatic activity varied by each media grain size table 3 the enzymatic activity results indicate the efficiency of both techniques assessing biological clogging in bank filtration bf simulation systems it was observed higher organic matter concentration retained in the columns filled with fine sand d10 0 16 mm followed by coarse d10 1 33 mm and medium sand d10 0 44 mm a significant difference α 0 05 in the organic matter retention in medium sand to fine and coarse sand was also observed regarding the enzymatic activity there was a higher concentration of fluorescein and dehydrogenase in coarse sand d10 1 33 mm followed by medium d10 0 44 mm and fine sand d10 0 16 mm however a significant difference α 0 05 in enzymatic activity among the filter media was not observed the sediments analysis available in the literature 35 37 indicates that bf sites exhibit higher esterase and dehydrogenase activity within a more significant period of operation due to the larger scale of organic accumulation and related processes one of them in lake tegel enzymatic activity fluorescein dehydrogenase in sediments indicated complex dependencies with temperature carbon presence nutrition load seasonality and structural organizations of microorganisms 36 37 in the rhône river high seasonal variations in fluorescein concentration at 20 cm of depth occurred in the hyporheic zone and the shore decreasing over depth the investigation showed a positive correlation between fluorescein total organic matter concentration persistent dissolved organic carbon and bacterial abundance 35 in this study pearson s correlation with a 95 of confidence level indicated a positive moderate and significant correlation among the aspects of organic matter fluorescein and dehydrogenase table 3 taylor et al 26 pointed out a high correlation between the dehydrogenase activity and other measurements of bacteriological abundances such as viable cell count direct count the relation of biomass carbon and dna wolińska and stepniewska 54 and kumar 55 also established a positive correlation in which the existence of total organic carbon toc influences the presence of enzymatic activity quantitative and qualitatively in the hyporheic zone of river and lake banks the interstitial habitat of the first layer of sediment usually presents a higher nutrient concentration organic matter availability and bacteria abundance 35 56 in this study the first layer of all filter media types used in the columns presented the highest concentration of retained organic particles fluorescein and dehydrogenase as well as a higher hydraulic conductivity decrease fig 5 it may represent the presence of bacteria and fungus which usually compose a more significant part of the biofilm formed on the surfaces of the grains and remain attached and active in the degradation and transformation of the organic matter providing nutrients for all the trophic levels of the system 57 59 the first centimeters of filter media correspond to higher fluorescein and dehydrogenase release layers due to subtracts degradation it means high microbiological activity resulting from the suspended particles retention process and microbiological growth due to dissolved oxygen and nutrient availability fig 5 a c as a result a significant hydraulic conductivity decrease was observed in the first 5 cm of the filter media in the columns establishing external clogging related to the biological presence fig 5 d e in lake tegel a bf site indicated greater enzymatic activity in the first 5 cm of sediment sand regarding dehydrogenase about 12 μg g 1 h 1 and fluorescein about 40 μg g 1 decreasing along with depth 36 37 in a bf site in rhône river fluorescein analysis indicated a significant decrease regarding enzymatic activities in depth considering 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm and from the river hyporheic zone to the shore 35 biofilm formation happens more intensely in smaller grain sizes due to the greater grain contact area according to the porosity and fluid velocity percolation smaller grains collect fine particles of organic material usually associated with higher organic matter retention 10 17 56 fine and coarse sand promotes significant biofilm formation in the upper layer which is much slower in coarse sand 60 the shear stress limits biofilm growth due to the fluid flow through the porous media 61 62 and the increase of hydrodynamic forces intensifies the transport of particles to higher filter media depths 45 leading to internal clogging the balance between detachment and biomass increase is one reason that makes it possible to reach stability 60 while the media depth increases organic matter availability and enzymatic activity fluorescein and dehydrogenase decrease the depth element presents itself as a limiting factor once the greater microbiologic abundance is in the upper layer of natural soils 54 55 due to reasons already mentioned it was observed a significant difference α 0 05 between the first layer 0 2 cm and the rest of the filter media when fine d10 0 16 mm and medium sand d10 0 44 mm are used filter material composed by coarse sand presented a significant difference in depth only regarding the enzymatic activity presented by fluorescein and the first 2 cm depth differed from the rest α 0 05 3 4 oxygen mobility aspects and nutrient availability dissolved oxygen and particulate organic matter transport can structure the organisms spatial distribution in the pore space and aggregated formations 63 also the oscillations of organic matter content and enzymatic activity at different filter media depths are caused by the organic fractions mobility in the columns due to hydrodynamic forces and homogeneity of the filter media 60 62 nutrient and dissolved oxygen mobility through the filter media is favored by the larger grain sizes fig 6 possibly leading to a higher enzymatic activity observed in coarse d10 1 33 mm and medium sand d10 0 44 mm when compared to fine sand d10 0 16 mm fine sand d10 0 16 mm even retaining a higher amount of organic matter may have presented limitations in dissolved oxygen and nutrient distribution along the column reflecting a lower enzymatic activity medium sand d10 0 44 mm had the lowest concentration of retained organic matter which may have been the limiting factor in enzymatic activity once it has presented more esterase and dehydrogenase activities than fine sand d10 0 16 mm but even then a lower activity than coarse sand d10 1 33 mm coarse sand d10 1 33 mm presented a higher concentration of retained organic matter than medium sand d10 0 44 mm in addition to a greater dissolved oxygen transport through the porous media which may have directly influenced the highest enzymatic activities means registered although there are some limitations in dehydrogenase activity that must be considered in the overview the dehydrogenases are characterized by intracellular actions which means that they oxidize the substrate endogenously differently from the esterases fluorescein formers which act freely and are also attached to the microorganisms cells the dehydrogenase activity may be underestimated due to competition with other hydrogen acceptors in the filter media 26 regarding the oxygen presence it is pointed that the dehydrogenase enzymes present activity in aerobic and anaerobic environments 64 though recent studies say there is an inverse relation between dehydrogenase and oxygen availability being the dehydrogenase potentialized in environments where oxygen concentration is reduced 54 65 on the other hand the fluorescein release activity is described in aerobic 66 and anaerobic environments 29 even though the methods consider different enzymes activity in distinct microbiological processes the results in this study showed similar behavior in terms of organic degradation and the positive correlation observed in their presence both methods showed microbiological activity and biological clogging in bf simulation systems as a monitoring tool the need to determine influent aspects in enzymatic activity such as nutrients and oxygen presence constitutes the next step 37 4 conclusions both methods fda and ttc proved to be useful for biological clogging investigations in bank filtration sites established as a tool for monitoring also homogeneous and poorly graded filter media indicated a potential expansion of the biological clogging process at different depths in this scenario different questions guided the used grain sizes regarding the clogging process establishing the following considerations there is greater retention of particulate organic material in homogeneous filter media of smaller grain sizes which leads to an external biological clogging process as the grain size increases the particle retention starts to occur externally and internally once there is greater porous space for the act of particle retention mechanisms homogeneous filter media favors internal clogging reflecting a diffuse distribution of organic particles in depth also greater grain sizes lead to slower clogging processes than smaller grain sizes which show less filtration rate decline over time homogeneous filter media of smaller grain sizes points to greater removal of water pollutants represented by turbidity apparent and true color while the lowest efficiency is attributed to homogeneous filter material of greater grain sizes external clogging presented expressively in all the grain sizes of the filter media has the organic matter accumulation correlated to the greater enzymatic activity by esterases and dehydrogenases thus biological clogging is intimately linked to the reduction of hydraulic conductivity mainly from surface layers of the filter media the enzymatic activity by esterases and dehydrogenases has depth as a limiting factor possibly conditioned by the dissolved oxygen and nutrient transport existing in each filter media in this scenario homogeneous filter media with

13283,in the current study ceria zirconia ce zr was coated in cellulose acetate ca polymer to make a nanocomposite sheet known as ca ce zr which was used for the stabilization of ni nanoparticles nps and is named as ca ce zr ni nps the ca ce zr ni nps was used as a dip catalyst for the reduction of ortho meta para nitrophenol onp mnp pnp congo red cr and methyl orange mo dyes degradation in aqueous medium using nabh4 as a reducing agent the rate constant k app value deduced from pseudo first order kinetics was found highest for cr degradation which is 2 95 10 1 min 1 compare to mo dye 2 95 10 1 min 1 similarly pnp displayed the highest rate constant value of 4 26 10 2 min 1 compared to onp 3 57 10 2 min 1 and mnp 4 05 10 2 min 1 furthermore approximately 91 of cr degradation was achieved in only 8 min an induction period t 0 of 10 min was observed for nitrophenol isomers the nanocomposite and its anchored ni nps was characterized through fesem xrd and ftir techniques the supported ni nps was found stable after the reaction completion and no leaching of the nps was observed therefore ca ce zr ni nps could possibly be used for large scale applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ca ce zr sheet anchoring of ni nps characterization nitrophenols reduction dyes degradation 1 introduction zero valent metal nanocatalysis zvm is the most promising field in the last few decades due to their diverse and high catalyst potential in various industrial and technological applications their high catalyst potential owed to their high surface energy large surface to volume ratio and small quantum size effect 1 3 in the era of 1990s zvm is one of the most practical applied materials to decontaminate various pollutants from wastewater however researcher took much interest in their use in various redox reactions 4 5 zvm nps can be synthesized through a simple and eco friendly way by treating their respective metal salt with a reducing agent and the as synthesized zvm are formed are uniform and polydispersed with few to several nm in size despite its simple method of synthesis it lost its catalyst activity owing to their fast agglomeration and aggregation 6 therefore one should consider an appropriate and effective solid support for their stabilization in order to avoid their aggregation and agglomeration although anchoring zvm nps on a solid matrix has some drawbacks such as masking of one side of the particles with the solid support however overall the solid matrix avoid their aggregation and prevent their catalyst inactivity therefore supported zvm can be effectively used as a dip catalyst where the catalyst can be recycled and reused and whipped out easily from the reaction medium some good example are present in the literature for the support of zvm but still there are some deficiencies which are not properly addressed 6 for instance leaching of the particles into the reaction system reusability mass transport and ease of separation from the reaction system are some issue which are not properly addressed therefore a satisfactory solid matrix is required for the stabilization and anchoring of zvm furthermore the leakage of zvm from the solid support causes extreme environmental issues which caused potential risk to both human and the living organism therefore a suitable solid support is highly required that not only avoid the leaching of the nps but also minimize their release to the environment the use of polymer coated nanoscale nanocomposites for zvm stabilization are highly recognized both at industrial and academic levels owing to their inherent properties and a unusually high surface area make it an emerging stabilizing agent for zvm nps furthermore polymer coated nanoscale stabilizing matrix overcome the bottleneck problems of nanocatalysis in practical implication such as separation after the reaction and reuse therefore in the current study polymer coated nanoscale stabilizing matrix such as ca ce zr solid matrix was used for the stabilization and support of ni nps with the aim to cease the leaching of nps cellulose acetate is an important polymer which is used in films formation and coatings industry due to their biodegradable nature furthermore thermal stability and crystalline nature make it a better option for the support and stabilization of nps besides many electron donating groups such as hydroxal and acetate can easily bind with the empty orbitals of metal ions and thus stabilize the zero valent nps however some discrepancy are associated with cellulose acetate such as hydrophobicity low solubility in some organic solvent and weak antimicrobial characteristics this discrepancy can be overcome by blended it with some other inorganic filler therefore ce zr was added to cellulose acetate host polymer in order to enhance their catalyst characteristics the addition of inorganic filler to the polymer host materials will facilitate the electron movement and thus degraded the organic pollutants faster compared to bare polymer 7 10 for the practical application and assessment of the catalyst potential of ca ce zr ni nps an atom economic model reaction is required such as reduction of nitrophenols to aminophenol nitrophenol reduction is considered a target reaction for the evaluation of zvm catalyst activity therefore nitrophenol isomers was reduced in this study besides we have further assessed the catalyst activity of ca ce zr ni nps against the degradation of azo dyes as toxic dyes removal photocatalysis is utmost at the present time due to its adverse effect on human and other living organism 11 14 nanocatalysis is one of the most important field which find many practical applications in various technological field 15 20 2 experimental section 2 1 reagents and materials nitrophenol isomers such as 2 3 4 nitrophenol designated as onp mnp pnp respectively and methyl orange and congo red dyes designated as mo and cr respectively were purchased from bdh while ceria zirconia and nabh4 were bought from sigma aldrich similarly 18 2 mω cm deionized water was used throughout the experiment 2 2 characterization of cellulose acetate a product no 27654 cellulose acetate polymer was purchased from bdh company with 53 5 to 54 5 acetic acid content in 95 acetone water mixture at 25 c while the viscosity of 6 solution using a no 3 bss viscometer was 75 to 110 cs 2 3 preparation of ce zr cellulose acetate hybrid composite the ca polymer 6 g was first dissolved in 43 7 acetone water mixture with continuous stirring after the formation of homogeneous solution of ca polymer 10 wt of ca ce zr was added and continuously homogenize through constant stirring and then cast on a clean glass plate for 24 h in an open atmosphere at room temperature after that the membrane was detached from the glass plate and dried 2 4 synthesis of ca ce zr ni nps the synthesized films was put in 100 ml of 0 1 mm niso4 solution for 12 h in order to saturate the adsorption sites of ca ce zr films after the ni 2 ions adsorption the ca ce zr films adsorbed ni 2 ions was dried and washed with distilled water to remove the un adsorbed metal salts of ni after that the ca ce zr adsorbed ni 2 ions films was treated with 10 ml of 0 1 mm nabh4 solution for 10 min to convert the adsorbed ni 2 ions to zero valent ni state the black color of ca ce zr ni nps reflects the formation of successful ni nps as shown in the inset of scheme 1 the conversion of ni 2 to ni0 is explained though the following chemical reactions 21 ni 2 bh4 3h2o 2e ni0 h3bo3 7h 3ni0 6h 3ni 2 3h2 2 5 reduction of nitrophenol isomers and discoloration of dyes the catalytic potential of ca ce zr ni nps was evaluated amid nitrophenol reduction and azo dyes degradation a stock solution of 0 1 mm of nitrophenol isomers and 0 05 mm of both mo and cr dyes were prepared for the reaction of nitrophenol isomers and dyes discoloration 2 5 ml of each spike solution was mixed with 1 mm 0 5 ml freshly prepared nabh4 solution and then added 25 mg of the ca ce zr ni nps and the reaction proceeding was recorded by recording their absorbance spectra the percent reduction of nitorphenol isomers to their respective amine group conversion was inferred from eq 1 1 reduction degradation cₒ cₜ cₒ 100 where co represents the initial concentration and ct final concentration of the solution after passing time t similarly the rate constant and r2 values were determined from pseudo 1st order kinetic model as presented in eq 2 2 ln c t c 0 kt c where co represents the initial concentration and ct indicated to the concentration of the solution after passing time t k is the rate constant and c is the integration constant 2 6 physio chemical characterization different spectroscopic and analytical procedures were employed for the analysis of ca ce zr ni nps for instance the amorphous nature of ca ce zr composite and crystalline nature of zero valent ni nps supported on ca ce zr composite were assessed through powder x ray diffraction technique thermo scientific diffractometer company with cu kα radiations source λ 0 154 nm similarly autonuated total reflectance fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy machine of thermo scientific company was used to record the functional group analysis of ca ce zr composite and ca ce zr ni nps and field emission scanning electron microscope of jeol jsm 7600f japan was used for textural characteristic of the sheets and nps similarly the batch experiments of nitrophenol reduction and dyes discoloration was monitored through uv visible spectrophotometer of thermo scientific evolution company 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 xrd a broad sharp hump due to poorly amorphous phase in ca ce zr composite appeared at 2θ 27 5 in the xrd spectrum fig 1 a this amorphous nature is the characteristics of organic moiety along with the amorphous peaks some crystalline peaks were appeared in the ca ce zr ni nps at 2θ 43 8 and 2θ 50 0 which are index to the 111 and 200 planes of ni nps this data is in good agreement with the jcpds card no 04 0850 and literature 22 23 scherrer equation was used to calculate the grain size of the crystalline peaks as presented in eq 3 3 d k λ β cosθ where d represents the crystallite size in nm k is the scherrer constant with value of 0 9 and λ is the wavelength 0 15406 nm with cukα1 source in the same way β is the fwhm full width half maximum value and θ is the peak position both fwhm and β are calculated in radians the peaks indexed at 2θ 29 4 43 8 and 50 0 have d value of 87 5 128 7 and 69 4 nm respectively while the average crystallite size calculated was 95 2 nm 22 24 the crystallinity of the ca ce zr ni catalyst was 6 09 and is determined from eq 2 25 4 crystallinity total area of crystalline peak total area of all the peaks 100 3 1 2 ftir the ftir spectrum of ca ce zr and ca ce zr ni nps is illustrated in fig 1b a broad absorbance exhibited at 3329 cm 1 was allotted to the oh anti symmetric stretching vibration 26 the breadth of the peak at 3329 cm 1 is attributed to the presence of multiple h bonding in both sheets 7 a small nick at 2923 and 2878 cm 1 appeared both in ca ce zr and ca ce zr ni nps is attributed to the ch asymmetric stretching vibration 26 27 the asymmetric absorption of the acetate group at 1642 and 1460 cm 1 respectively suggesting the ca polymer backbone 28 other low intense peaks also present in the range of 1100 1400 cm 1 due to the ester groups such as cco and coc bending vibrations similarly the ch2 and ch3 stretching vibrations were also exhibited in the range of 1200 1450 cm 1 confirming the ca polymer backbone 29 the co bond appeared at 1044 cm 1 furthermore a broad low intense peak appeared in both sheets suggesting the presence of ce zr the peak at 1045 cm 1 was due to co stretching vibrations 30 the above data and explanation revealed the presence of ca polymer incorporated ce zr and its anchored ni nps with little modification 3 1 3 fesem the ca ce zr composite and ca ce zr ni nps sheets were characterized through fesem as shown in the inset of fig 2 a b the ca ce zr shown a flat surface area however as manifested in fig 2c d the ni nps are entrenched in the ca ce zr composite sheets which suggested the stable nature of ni nps on the surface of ca ce zr composite sheet the ni nps are protruded from the ca ce zr composite sheet 3 2 catalyst evaluation the catalyst potential of ca ce zr ni nps was evaluated against nitrophenol reduction and degradation of azo dyes 3 2 1 reduction of nitrophenol isomers the ca ce zr ni nps catalyst was studied for the reduction hydrogenation of nitrophenol isomers such onp mnp and pnp using nabh4 as a reductant the uv vis absorbance spectrum of all the three nitrophenols are shown in fig 3 a c the onp mnp and pnp appeared at λmax 350 290 and 315 nm respectively in their uv vis spectrum however after the addition of nabh4 solution the λmax of the mentioned nitrophenols extend further to 415 390 and 400 nm respectively this increase in the maximum wavelength is attributed to the increased conjugation in all the three nitrophenols the reducing agent nabh4 abstract the proton from the oh group and leaving the negative charge on the oxygen atom it is a well known fact that the negative charge is more stabilized on the more electronegative element which results in a better charge distribution and extension in conjugation the formation of ortho nitrophenolate anion will displayed a sharp yellow color because of the extended conjugation however nabh4 will only convert the nitrophenol to their corresponding phenolate anion the reduction of onp to oap required an activation energy barrier which is not provided by the nabh4 alone therefore zero valent nps is describe to overcome this energy barrier along with nabh4 therefore both catalyst and reducing agent is the essential criterion to this reduction reaction after freshly preparing the ni nps on the surface of ca ce zr composite sheets 25 mg of it was placed in a uv cuvette containing 2 5 ml of 0 1 mm onp and 0 5 ml of 1 mm nabh4 solution after mixing the catalyst with onp reducing agent the reaction proceedings was recorded in a uv vis spectrophotometer and periodically monitored the reduction of onp to ortho amino phenol oap approximately 61 15 of the onp was reduced to amine counterpart in 26 min fig 3d similar explanations are true for the reduction of mnp and pnp in the presence of catalyst and nabh4 the mnp and pnp appeared at 290 and 315 nm respectively in their uv vis spectrum which are extended to 390 and 400 nm respectively after treating with nabh4 see absorbance spectrum in the inset of 3b and 3c respectively after that the decrease in absorbance after 1 min was monitored at 390 and 400 nm for mnp and pnp respectively after 44 and 36 min the percent degradation of pnp and mnp was 81 32 and 76 26 respectively 3 2 1 1 plausible mechanism for the reduction of onp to oap the bh4 1 and nitrohenols first accommodated on the surface of ca ce zr ni nps where the electron transfer process kick start the reaction after the adsorption of nitrophenols and bh4 1 the catalyst rearranged their surface for the proper transfer of electrons and protons after the adsorption of analyte the h 1 ions of nabh4 remove the oh proton which result pale to deep yellow color change the appearance of the deep yellow color indicated the formation of ortho nitrophenolate anion which is appeared at 415 nm in their uv vis spectrum briefly the reduction of onp to oap is a six electron proton transfer reaction via various intermediates including nitrene nitroso phenolate and hydroxal amine phenolate formation as depicted in scheme 2 3 2 2 degradation of mo and cr dyes the ca ce zr ni nps were applied for the degradation of azo dyes such as mo and cr dyes fig 4 a b the mo dye are mono and cr dye are diazo dyes 31 32 the λmax of mo dye exhibited at 464 nm and is converted to their hydrazine derivatives after reacting with nabh4 as nabh4 is a reducing agent therefore the the azo group nn reduces to hydrazine group hnnh as manifested in scheme 3 reduction of azo group of mo which later on converted to the oxidized product after reacting with ca ce zr ni nps the hydrazine derivatives appeared at 253 nm in the absorbance spectrum however its color does not vanished by the action of nabh4 alone however decolorized with the addition of ca ce zr ni nps after the addition of nps the color of mo dye was 100 decolorized in 19 min fig 4a during the disolcoration of mo dye a new peak appeared at 248 nm which increased with time owing to the formation of amine containing products similarly the ca ce zr ni nps was used against the degradation of cr dye the cr dye is a diazo dye having maximum wavelength at 495 nm both the azo groups are converted to hydrazine derivatives after the addition of nabh4 it is believed that the degradation of cr dye in the presence of nabh4 is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically unfavorable process 8 33 the decrease in the absorbance intensity with the passage of time at 495 nm was recorded for 8 min after 8 min the red color of the cr was completely vanished and approximately 91 of the cr dye was decolorized only in 8 min fig 4b two new peaks at 290 nm and 250 nm were observed in the cr absorbance spectrum amid cr discoloration which representing the formation of nh2 containing products it was observed that approximately 91 of cr dye was degraded in 8 min while 99 of the mo dye was decolorized in 19 min fig 4c as manifested in fig 4d the mo dye gradually decolorized as a function of time furthermore in all the images no leaching of the nanoparticles is seen which reflects the stability of ca ce zr ni nps 3 2 3 kinetics study among the nitrophenol isomers the k app value for pnp is 4 26 10 2 min 1 which are higher than onp and mnp table 1 and fig 5 a similarly the rate constant k app was calculated from the pseudo first order kinetics as provided in the inset of eq 3 the rate constant 2 95 10 1 min 1 was highest for cr dye compared to 2 68 10 1 min 1 fig 5b as seen in the inset of fig 5a and 5b a delay time called induction period t 0 was encountered in the reduction of nitrophenols and degradation of dyes the t 0 is usually observed in catalysis where the various atoms on the surface of particles reorganized themselves before the reaction and thus during this period the reaction is slow therefore the delay time is considered positively because the atoms on the surface of nps exposes their active sites in terms of edges faces or corners which leads to an increase in the rate of reaction this induction period is mainly encountered in nitrophenols reduction and dyes degradation in the presence of a reducing agent and a zero valent nanocatalyst this period is usually ranging from few seconds to hours as seen approximately 10 min of t 0 was observed for nitrophenols reduction where this delay period for mo and cr was 4 and 6 min respectively therefore both nitrophenols and dyes degradation was initially proceed through a slow rate but afterwards the reaction was increased swiftly 3 3 repeatability of the catalyst the ca ce zr ni nps was repeated for the discoloration of cr dye in the presence of nabh4 after completing the 1st cycle the catalyst was again placed in nabh4 and used in the next cycle it was observed that catalyst activity was dropped little after 2nd and 3rd cycle for instance the 1st cycle was completed in 8 min while the second and third cycle took 12 and 17 min respectively to decolorize the cr dye 4 conclusion in the current study ca ce zr nanocomposite template was synthesized through a simple but an economic casting method 10 wt of the ce zr was incorporated to the ca polymer host material to increase its porosity tensile strength and stabilize the zero valent ni nps the ca ce zr ni nps was synthesized by the adsorption of ni ions from ni salt solution and a subsequent treatment with nabh4 solution the ca ce zr ni nps was used as a dip catalyst for the reduction nitrophenol and azo dyes degradation in the presence of nabh4 as a reducing agent an induction period was observed amid the reduction of nitrophenols and dye degradation the highest rate constant k app was found for cr degradation which is 2 95 10 1 min 1 compare to mo dye 2 95 10 1 min 1 similarly among the nitrophenol isomers pnp displayed the highest rate constant of 4 26 10 2 min 1 no leaching of ni nps was observed from the surface of ca ce zr template after nitrophenol reduction or dyes degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

multiple h bonding in both sheets 7 a small nick at 2923 and 2878 cm 1 appeared both in ca ce zr and ca ce zr ni nps is attributed to the ch asymmetric stretching vibration 26 27 the asymmetric absorption of the acetate group at 1642 and 1460 cm 1 respectively suggesting the ca polymer backbone 28 other low intense peaks also present in the range of 1100 1400 cm 1 due to the ester groups such as cco and coc bending vibrations similarly the ch2 and ch3 stretching vibrations were also exhibited in the range of 1200 1450 cm 1 confirming the ca polymer backbone 29 the co bond appeared at

nitrophenol reduction and degradation of azo dyes 3 2 1 reduction of nitrophenol isomers the ca ce zr ni nps catalyst was studied for the reduction hydrogenation of nitrophenol isomers such onp mnp and pnp using nabh4 as a reductant the uv vis absorbance spectrum of all the three nitrophenols are shown in fig 3 a c the onp mnp and pnp appeared at λmax 350 290 and 315 nm respectively in their uv vis spectrum however after the addition of nabh4 solution the λmax of the mentioned nitrophenols extend further to 415 390 and 400 nm respectively this increase in the maximum wavelength is attributed to the increased conjugation in all the three nitrophenols the reducing agent nabh4 abstract the proton from the oh group and leaving the negative charge on the oxygen atom it is a well known fact that the negative charge is more stabilized on the more electronegative element which results in a better charge distribution and extension in conjugation the formation of ortho nitrophenolate anion will displayed a sharp yellow color because of the extended conjugation however nabh4 will only convert the nitrophenol to their corresponding phenolate anion the reduction of onp to oap required an activation energy barrier which is not provided by the nabh4 alone therefore zero valent nps is describe to overcome this energy barrier along with nabh4 therefore both catalyst and reducing agent is the essential criterion to this reduction reaction after freshly preparing the ni nps on the surface of ca ce zr composite sheets 25 mg of it was placed in a uv cuvette containing 2 5 ml of 0 1 mm onp and 0 5 ml of 1 mm nabh4 solution after mixing the catalyst with onp reducing agent the reaction proceedings was recorded in a uv vis spectrophotometer and periodically monitored the reduction of onp to ortho amino phenol oap approximately 61 15 of the onp was reduced to amine counterpart in 26 min fig 3d similar explanations are true for the reduction of mnp and pnp in the presence of catalyst and nabh4 the mnp and pnp appeared at 290 and 315 nm respectively in their uv vis spectrum which are extended to 390 and 400 nm respectively after treating with nabh4 see absorbance spectrum in the inset of 3b and 3c respectively after that the decrease in absorbance after 1 min was monitored at 390 and 400 nm for mnp and pnp respectively after 44 and 36 min the percent degradation of pnp and mnp was 81 32 and 76 26 respectively 3 2 1 1 plausible mechanism for the reduction of onp to oap the bh4 1 and nitrohenols first accommodated on the surface of ca ce zr ni nps where the electron transfer process kick start the reaction after the adsorption of nitrophenols and bh4 1 the catalyst rearranged their surface for the proper transfer of electrons and protons after the adsorption of analyte the h 1 ions of nabh4 remove the oh proton which result pale to deep yellow color change the appearance of the deep yellow color indicated the formation of ortho nitrophenolate anion which is appeared at 415 nm in their uv vis spectrum briefly the reduction of onp to oap is a six electron proton transfer reaction via various intermediates including nitrene nitroso phenolate and hydroxal amine phenolate formation as depicted in scheme 2 3 2 2 degradation of mo and cr dyes the ca ce zr ni nps were applied for the degradation of azo dyes such as mo and cr dyes fig 4 a b the mo dye are mono and cr dye are diazo dyes 31 32 the λmax of mo dye exhibited at 464 nm and is converted to their hydrazine derivatives after reacting with nabh4 as nabh4 is a reducing agent therefore the the azo group nn reduces to hydrazine group hnnh as manifested in scheme 3 reduction of azo group of mo which later on converted to the oxidized product after reacting with ca ce zr ni nps the hydrazine derivatives appeared at 253 nm in the absorbance spectrum however its color does not vanished by the action of nabh4 alone however decolorized with the addition of ca ce zr ni nps after the addition of nps the color of mo dye was 100 decolorized in 19 min fig 4a during the disolcoration of mo dye a new peak appeared at 248 nm which increased with time owing to the formation of amine containing products similarly the ca ce zr ni nps was used against the degradation of cr dye the cr dye is a diazo dye having maximum wavelength at 495 nm both the azo groups are converted to hydrazine derivatives after the addition of nabh4 it is believed that the degradation of cr dye in the presence of nabh4 is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically unfavorable process 8 33 the decrease in the absorbance intensity with the passage of time at 495 nm was recorded for 8 min after 8 min the red color of the cr was completely vanished and approximately 91 of the cr dye was decolorized only in 8 min fig 4b two new peaks at 290 nm and 250 nm were observed in the cr absorbance spectrum amid cr discoloration which representing the formation of nh2 containing products it was observed that approximately 91 of cr dye was degraded in 8 min while 99 of the mo dye was decolorized in 19 min fig 4c as manifested in fig 4d the mo dye gradually decolorized as a function of time furthermore in all the images no leaching of the nanoparticles is seen which reflects the stability of ca ce zr ni nps 3 2 3 kinetics study among the nitrophenol isomers the k app value for pnp is 4 26 10 2 min 1 which are higher than onp and mnp table 1 and fig 5 a similarly the rate constant k app was calculated from the pseudo first order kinetics as provided in the inset of eq 3 the rate constant 2 95 10 1 min 1 was highest for cr dye compared to 2 68 10 1 min 1 fig 5b as seen in the inset of fig 5a and 5b a delay time called induction period t 0 was encountered in the reduction of nitrophenols and degradation of dyes the t 0 is usually observed in catalysis where the various atoms on the surface of particles reorganized themselves before the reaction and thus during this period the reaction is slow therefore the delay time is considered positively because the atoms on the surface of nps exposes their active sites in terms of edges faces or corners which leads to an increase in the rate of reaction this induction period is mainly encountered in nitrophenols reduction and dyes degradation in the presence of a reducing agent and a zero valent nanocatalyst this period is usually ranging from few seconds to hours as seen approximately 10 min of t 0 was observed for nitrophenols reduction where this delay period for mo and cr was 4 and 6 min respectively therefore both nitrophenols and dyes degradation was initially proceed through a slow rate but afterwards the reaction was increased swiftly 3 3 repeatability of the catalyst the ca ce zr ni nps was repeated for the discoloration of cr dye in the presence of nabh4 after completing the 1st cycle the catalyst was again placed in nabh4 and used in the next cycle it was observed that catalyst activity was dropped little after 2nd and 3rd cycle for instance the 1st cycle was completed in 8 min while the second and third cycle took 12 and 17 min respectively to decolorize the cr dye 4 conclusion in the current study ca ce zr nanocomposite template was synthesized through a simple but an economic casting method 10 wt of the ce zr was incorporated to the ca polymer host material to increase its porosity tensile strength and stabilize the zero valent ni nps the ca ce zr ni nps was synthesized by the adsorption of ni ions from ni salt solution and a subsequent treatment with nabh4 solution the ca ce zr ni nps was used as a dip catalyst for the reduction nitrophenol and azo dyes degradation in the presence of nabh4 as a reducing agent an induction period was observed amid the reduction of nitrophenols and dye degradation the highest rate constant k app was found for cr degradation which is 2 95 10 1 min 1 compare to mo dye 2 95 10 1 min 1 similarly among the nitrophenol isomers pnp displayed the highest rate constant of 4 26 10 2 min 1 no leaching of ni nps was observed from the surface of ca ce zr template after nitrophenol reduction or dyes degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13284,copper ferrite embedded in montmorillonite cufe2o4 montmorillonite cf mt was designed and employed as a composite catalyst for peroxymonosulfate pms activation to degrade ofloxacin ofl cufe2o4 characterization confirmed that this compound successfully dispersed on the surface of the montmorillonite cf mt loaded with 40 cufe2o4 0 4cf mt possessed favorable magnetic properties excellent pore structure and abundant catalytic sites obtaining the highest ofl degradation efficiency 85 2 in the presence of pms compared to other cf mt composites with different cufe2o4 loads influencing parameters including catalyst dosage pms concentration initial ph and co existing anions were also investigated high catalyst dosage and pms concentrations were found to favor ofl degradation the optimum ph in the 0 4cf mt pms system for ofl removal was 6 8 neutral ph additionally cl promoted ofl degradation performance whereas h2po4 and hco3 had the opposite effect radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrated that the ofl degradation in the 0 4cf mt pms system was largely attributed to free radical pathways dominated by so4 and oh ofl mineralization increased with reaction time finally reaching a mineralization rate of 54 8 furthermore 0 4cf mt maintained excellent catalytic activity after repeated use taken together this study provides a basis for the development of strategies to design bimetallic oxide catalysts for the efficient treatment of antibiotic contaminated wastewater with pms graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords montmorillonite based catalyst peroxymonosulfate advanced oxidation process ofloxacin free radical pathway 1 introduction antibiotics in wastewater cannot be easily treated due to their complex composition high toxicity and poor biodegradability therefore antibiotic water pollution poses a serious threat to human and ecosystem health 1 2 relevant studies have demonstrated that quinolone and tetracycline i e two commonly prescribed antibiotic types require higher oxidation potentials than other antibiotics to be completely degraded and therefore these compounds are uniquely persistent in environmental samples 3 4 ofloxacin ofl a third generation quinolone agent has a strong antibacterial effect on both gram positive and gram negative bacteria thus ofl consumption accounts for one fifth of global quinolone usage although antibiotics such as ofl occur at relatively low concentrations in water or wastewater these compounds can not only adversely affect ecological systems due to their chronic toxicity but also promote the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria via induction and selection processes 5 furthermore ofl may pose a considerable human health risk after long term exposure resulting in abdominal pain dizziness and numbness of limbs therefore developing novel and effective strategies to degrade quinolone antibiotics such as ofl has become an important priority for organic pollution control due to the antibacterial effects of antibiotics antibiotic contaminated wastewater is commonly treated with physical chemical methods such as adsorption 6 membrane separation 7 and flocculation 8 as well as advanced oxidation processes aops 9 however physical chemical methods cannot completely decompose pollutants by only separating antibiotics from the water whereas aops rapidly decompose organic pollutants by generating highly oxidizing free radicals through electron transfer hydrogen extraction or additive reactions aops have thus garnered increasing attention in the scientific community due to their many advantages including high oxidation efficiency low cost practicality and environmental friendliness peroxymonosulfate pms is an asymmetric oxidant whose asymmetric structure coupled with the strong electron accepting ability of so3 facilitates the shift of electrons between the oo bonds of pms and so3 this process breaks bonds and generates sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh 10 therefore pms has become one of the most common oxidants in aops ultraviolet light 11 ultrasound 12 heat 13 and transition metals metal oxides 14 15 are routinely used to activate pms and enhance its reactive oxygen species ros yields compared with the aforementioned technologies pms activation by transition metals and their oxides is more energy efficient 16 17 however this approach causes severe secondary pollution of metal leaching 18 which limits the practical applications of this method although the leaching rate of metal ions is relatively slow agglomerated metal oxide particles are not sufficiently active for pms activation due to a decrease in specific surface area and available catalytic sites therefore support structures are routinely employed to actively prevent particle aggregation qin et al 19 synthesized a femg biochar catalyst femgo bc through co precipitation and pyrolysis processes which they used to catalyze pms activation for sulfamethazine degradation similarly xu et al 20 introduced sepiolite as a support structure to synthesize a novel magnetic fe3o4 sepiolite composite via the co precipitation method which was used to activate persulfate to degrade atrazine moreover cofe2o4 dispersed on organic montmorillonite was synthesized through the hydrothermal method and exhibited favorable pms activation performance 21 however the aforementioned catalysts are relatively difficult to synthesize and are not sufficiently efficient for practical applications thus highlighting the need for more cost effective efficient and robust catalysts the bimetal oxide cufe2o4 possesses excellent synergistic pms activation ability when coupled with cufe in heterogeneous catalysis 22 zhang et al 23 reported that cufe2o4 was more active and exhibited a lower cu2 leaching rate than cuo under the same dosage consequently cufe2o4 is considered as an ideal metal oxide for pms activation owing to their low cost and chemical stability natural minerals have been proposed as an efficient material for catalyst preparation 24 particularly montmorillonite mt a layered silicate clay mineral is a promising adsorbent or catalyst carrier for environmental remediation 25 due to its excellent expansion capacity large specific surface area and high cation exchange capacity additionally montmorillonite can greatly facilitate cufe2o4 dispersion due to its permanent negative charge and abundant hydroxyl functional groups these properties together with the abundant hydroxyl functional groups of mt that act as active sites led us to explore whether these compounds could be used jointly for pms activation in this study a magnetic copper ferrite montmorillonite cufe2o4 montmorillonite cf mt composite catalyst was synthesized via the citrate combustion method by dispersing cufe2o4 on mt the prepared cf mt not only contained abundant hydroxyl functional groups but also enabled the formation of coordination bonds between cufe2o4 and montmorillonite which improved the stability of the catalyst and prevented the aggregation of cufe2o4 particles thus ensuring the exposure of catalytic sites additionally this study characterized the crystal structure specific surface area and elemental composition of cf mt as well as its ofl degradation efficiency under different reaction parameters lastly ros quenching experiments were conducted to identify the dominant mechanisms of ofl degradation after which the characteristics of cf mt were compared before and after the reaction 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the sodium based montmorillonite na mt used in this study was purchased from shandong province china ofloxacin 98 purity potassium

citric acid c6h8o7 sulfuric acid h2so4 sodium hydroxide naoh sodium chloride nacl phosphoric acid sodium dihydrogen nah2po4 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 ethanol etoh and tert butanol tba were analytical grade and purchased from chengdu kelong chemical co ltd 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was purchased from shanghai yuanye biotechnology co ltd all experiments were conducted using deionized di water 2 2 preparation of cufe2o4 mt as described in a previous study 26 cf mt was synthesized via a simple citrate combustion method the fabrication process is detailed in text s1 supporting information according to the different cufe2o4 loading ratios on the montmorillonite the samples were labeled as ncf mt where n represents the mass proportion of cufe2o4 in cf mt n 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 cufe2o4 samples were prepared through the same process for comparison na mt was also fabricated through calcination in a muffle furnace at 400 c and the product of this process is hereinafter referred to as c mt 2 3 experimental and analytical methods ofl degradation tests were conducted in an erlenmeyer flask 100 ml at 30 2 c predetermined amounts of pms and catalyst were added into the ofl solution 50 ml 40 mg l to initiate the reaction at selected time intervals 2 ml of the solution were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter membrane and used to analyze the remaining ofl concentration during the experiment etoh and tba were added as quenchers to assess the effect of ros the concentration of the ofl solution was determined via high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm text s2 supporting information describes the methods used to test and calculate the remaining ofl ratio in the solution as well as the degradation efficiency and first order kinetic rate constant of the reaction 2 4 characterization method the structural properties of the prepared materials were characterized using x ray diffraction analysis xrd specific surface area analyzer bet scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive spectroscopy eds transmission electron microscopy tem high resolution tem hrtem vibrating sample magnetometer vsm and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to determine the mechanisms of ofl degradation the main ros in the system was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance epr using dmpo and temp as spin trapping agents more details on the characterization method are described in text s3 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the crystal structures of na mt c mt cufe2o4 and ncf mt were compared via xrd as illustrated in fig 1 a within a 2 75 scanning range the characteristic peaks of na mt at a 2θ of 7 70 21 18 26 96 35 36 54 62 and 62 22 corresponded with its 001 100 004 105 210 and 300 crystal planes among these a higher peak intensity of na mt relative to c mt was observed at the 001 plane which was attributed to the disappearance of interlayer water in montmorillonite after calcination 27 moreover the existence of the 100 plane indicated that the layered structure of montmorillonite had not been disrupted further the 2θ diffraction peaks of 18 51 30 45 35 86 38 74 43 94 58 19 and 62 53 were attributed to the 111 220 311 222 400 511 and 440 crystal planes of cufe2o4 jcpds no 34 0425 indicating the successful preparation of pure cufe2o4 28 additionally all ncf mt composite catalysts were composed of the crystalline structure of montmorillonite and cufe2o4 thus demonstrating their favorable combination as the cufe2o4 composition in the ncf mt composite increased the intensity of the cufe2o4 diffraction peak also increased gradually whereas the intensity of the corresponding diffraction peak of mt decreased gradually the amount of reaction centers and adsorption capacity of a heterogeneous catalyst are largely determined by its pore structure 29 30 pore structure can affect the probability of contact between the catalyst and its substrates e g pms or ofl and ultimately determines the adsorption capacity and catalytic properties of catalysts therefore the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of each sample were characterized in fig 1 b according to the iupac classification 31 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of each sample were similar in type belonging to the type iv isotherm adsorption curve and offering h3 hysteresis loops through capillary condensation indicating that the aggregation of flake particles results in the formation of many slit shaped channels 32 when p p 0 is close to 1 the adsorption curve of the n2 molecules in the external surface of the particles was slightly inverted due to agglomeration these results confirm the occurrence of multilayer adsorption and imply the existence of mesopores 33 compared with c mt and cufe2o4 the n2 adsorption capacity of the ncf mt sample increased significantly indicating that the adsorption performance of ncf mt improved according to fig s1 and table s1 the pore size distribution of each sample was between 2 and 50 nm indicating that the pore size of these samples was mainly mesoporous with a small proportion of micropores regarding the pore size distribution trends the pore size of c mt and ncf mt composites exhibited a peak value between 3 and 8 nm suggesting that mesopores played an important role and promoted the adsorption of pollutants by ncf mt 34 as indicated in table s1 the specific surface area of the ncf mt composite after modification was much higher than that of c mt and cufe2o4 thus confirming that this combination can greatly optimize the surface structure of the ncf mt this was because the large specific surface of cufe2o4 enabled this compound to be uniformly dispersed on the montmorillonite surface thus preventing cufe2o4 agglomeration and greatly increasing the specific surface area of ncf mt moreover compared with c mt cufe2o4 and other ncf mt composites 0 4cf mt had the highest specific surface area 97 120 m2 g the largest pore volume 0 1691 cm3 g and the smallest average pore size 6 105 nm this suggests that 0 4cf mt may be more efficient in adsorbing pms and ofl than other catalysts which facilitates the reaction between pms and the active sites on the catalytic material thus substantially improving ofl removal efficiency to further characterize the surface morphology of the synthesized material different samples were examined via sem analysis the calcined montmorillonite exhibited a smooth and well defined flake structure fig 1 c whereas cufe2o4 had a tetragonal phase structure with agglomeration fig 1 d as the cufe2o4 loads on the montmorillonite increased fig 1 e and fig s2 a d the montmorillonite surface gradually became rough indicating that the cufe2o4 was successfully loaded onto the montmorillonite cufe2o4 self aggregation occurred when the cufe2o4 loads on the montmorillonite surface exceeded 40 thus significantly reducing the available active sites as shown in fig 1 f the uniform dispersion of elements in 0 4cf mt further confirmed that the cufe2o4 was uniformly distributed on the montmorillonite surface the morphology and microstructure of c mt cufe2o4 and 0 4cf mt were determined via tem analysis as shown in fig 1 g the c mt catalyst had a layered structure with convoluted wrinkles on the edges which promoted the uniform distribution of cufe2o4 in the synthesis process in comparison cufe2o4 fig 1 h exhibited large and uneven sized particles which resulted in severe agglomeration and made it difficult for the particles to make full contact with the pollutants as illustrated in fig 1 i the cufe2o4 particles loaded on the montmorillonite lamellar surface were significantly smaller and evenly distributed suggesting that the active sites on the catalyst surface could be fully utilized the lattice fringes of 0 4cf mt with a d spacing of 0 251 nm and 0 294 nm as determined from the hrtem image fig 1 j were attributed to the 311 and 220 planes of cufe2o4 35 which was consistent with the xrd results xps characterization was then conducted to investigate the chemical states of each sample c mt cufe2o4 0 4cf mt al si o cu and fe signals were confirmed in the survey spectra of 0 4cf mt fig s3 where the presence of the c peak was ascribed to the introduced ambient c during the tests as seen in table s2 0 4cf mt was composed of elements from c mt and cufe2o4 which further confirmed the successful deposition of cufe2o4 on the montmorillonite fig 2 a illustrates the characteristic peaks of al si o cu and fe in 0 4cf mt both c mt and 0 4cf mt exhibited characteristic peaks at a binding energy of 74 6 ev which can be attributed to al2o3 or alo oh in the montmorillonite structure 26 33 in comparison the presence of a weak original peak 77 1 ev in the al 2p spectrum was potentially due to the formation of fe o al or cu o al bonds in 0 4cf mt in the si 2p region fig 2 b the peak at 102 8 ev in the spectra of c mt and 0 4cf mt was characteristic of the sio bond in the montmorillonite structure 26 indicating that the introduction of cufe2o4 did not change the sio bond of montmorillonite the o 1s spectra fig 2 c of c mt can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 532 2 ev and 531 7 ev which coincides with the surface adsorption of h2o and surface hydroxyl oh 37 regarding cufe2o4 the peak at 530 0 ev was assigned to lattice oxygen 38 39 the slight shift in the lattice oxygen peak 530 5 ev in 0 4cf mt could be ascribed to the formation of a new bond between mt and cufe2o4 compared with cufe2o4 a higher hydroxyl peak intensity was observed in 0 4cf mt with increased oxygen content which likely originated from the abundant oh in montmorillonite a previous study reported that oh can accelerate the dispersion of catalysts by increasing the effective reaction area between catalysts and pollutants thereby increasing the amount of active sites 35 additionally oh could not only generate oh on the montmorillonite surface by reacting with electrons but also enhanced the likelihood of ros generation by increasing the electron density and reducing the activation energy of oxidation and reduction reactions li et al 26 directly utilized kaolinite rich in hydroxyl groups to activate pms thus achieving atrazine removal rates of over 90 within 120 min therefore it can be inferred that cufe2o4 supported on montmorillonite would have a better catalytic performance the cu 2p spectrum fig s4 with binding energies of 933 4 ev and 936 0 ev was attributed to cu ii with satellite peaks at 941 0 ev and 943 1 ev the fe 2p spectrum fig 2 d exhibited typical double peaks of fe 2p with binding energies of approximately 711 ev and 724 ev corresponding to the fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 orbits 40 41 according to previous studies 42 43 the characteristic peak fixed at 709 3 ev was ascribed to fe ii whereas the peaks at 710 2 711 3 713 0 714 8 and 724 1 ev all correspond to fe iii with a satellite peak at 718 7 ev however compared with pure cufe2o4 the characteristic peak of 0 4cf mt shifted slightly to a higher binding energy in the fe spectrum further confirming that cufe2o4 was stably anchored on the montmorillonite surface due to the formation of fe o al bonds additionally the cu and fe content was significantly reduced relative to cufe2o4 indicating that loading cufe2o4 on montmorillonite promoted its uniform distribution to determine the recyclability of the prepared catalysts the magnetic properties of cufe2o4 and 0 4cf mt were characterized through h m hysteresis loop analysis fig s5 the saturation magnetization ms of cufe2o4 was determined to be 29 94 emu g indicating strong magnetism in contrast the ms of 0 4cf mt dropped to approximately 11 16 emu g due to the incorporation of montmorillonite a non magnetic material given its strong magnetism 0 4cf mt could be rapidly recovered from suspension within 30 s upon applying an external magnetic field fig s5 inset this property is advantageous for the rapid separation and recycling of the catalyst 3 2 adsorption and catalytic degradation of ofl this study also investigated the ofl adsorption properties of different samples fig 3 a montmorillonite based catalysts have a higher adsorption capacity compared to cufe2o4 alone with the better adsorption achieving in 0 2cf mt and 0 4cf mt reaching optimal adsorption this was likely because the interlayer and surface of montmorillonite possessed hydroxyl groups resulting in abundant adsorption sites moreover ofl could have been adsorbed onto the montmorillonite surface via electrostatic attraction or it could have otherwise occupied the montmorillonite space through ion exchange 44 45 although cufe2o4 has a large specific surface area it also has fewer adsorption sites and is prone to self agglomeration resulting in sub optimal ofl removal efficiency according to the bet characterization results 0 4cf mt possessed the largest specific surface area and pore volume and could thus provide a large number of active sites for ofl which greatly improved adsorption performance however when the cufe2o4 load levels on montmorillonite exceeded 40 the adsorption channels of cf mt were partially blocked by cufe2o4 leading to a decrease in active sites therefore the ofl adsorption capacities of 0 5cf mt and 0 6cf mt were significantly reduced the catalytic degradation performance of the synthesized material was further evaluated by adding pms into the reaction solution as shown in fig 3 b almost no ofl 3 1 was removed in the presence of pms only suggesting that pms itself barely oxidizes ofl in contrast pure cufe2o4 exhibited higher removal efficiency relative to its adsorption activity this can be attributed to the strong magnetism of cufe2o4 resulting in the uneven dispersion and inefficient contact with pms and ofl in the reaction solution furthermore the abundant hydroxyl groups and permanent negative charge of montmorillonite could slow down the crystallization process of cufe2o4 on the surface of montmorillonite this prevented the self aggregation of the catalyst and therefore more catalytic sites remained exposed on the surface of the material 21 at the same time the hydroxyl groups can also be used as reaction sites for pms activation resulting in ros production 26 at 60 min the ofl degradation efficiency of 0 2cf mt 0 3cf mt 0 4cf mt 0 5cf mt and 0 6cf mt reached 64 3 63 4 85 2 64 4 and 58 3 respectively the degradation dynamics of ofl were consistent with a first order kinetic model fig s6 the highest reaction rate constant was achieved at 0 4cf mt and therefore these conditions maximized the ofl degradation rate these results may be attributed to the higher specific surface area larger pore volume and hydroxyl group abundance of 0 4cf mt coupled with the uniform fixation of cufe2o4 particles thus accelerating the catalytic reaction process compared to adsorption and degradation activities it is found that although 0 2cf mt and 0 4cf mt had strong ofl adsorption capacities the degradation performance of 0 2cf mt was inferior to that of 0 4cf mt this is because 0 2cf mt has a lower cufe2o4 load and a smaller specific surface area which results in fewer available active sites in a subsequent study the 0 4cf mt catalyst was used to explore the effect of environmental factors on ofl degradation in the 0 4cf mt pms system 3 3 effect of reaction parameters on ofl degradation the degradation performance of a catalyst not only depends on its physical and chemical properties but also the environmental factors therefore the effects of various parameters including catalyst dosage pms concentration initial ph value and co existing ions on the ofl degradation capacity of the 0 4cf mt pms system were systematically investigated 3 3 1 effect of catalyst dosage the influence of catalyst dosage on ofl removal was studied firstly fig 4 a and fig s7 a as illustrated in fig 4 a the degradation efficiency of ofl increased from 57 6 to 85 2 as the 0 4cf mt dosage increased from 0 2 g l to 0 4 g l increasing the catalyst concentration results in an obvious enhancement of available active sites which increased the likelihood of contact between the catalyst and pms in turn this improves ofl degradation performance due to an increase in ros generation however the ofl removal rate increased only slightly when the 0 4cf mt dosage was increased to 0 3 g l this was likely because catalysts tend to agglomerate at high concentrations in which case the active sites cannot be effectively utilized only increasing the amount of catalyst without improving the oxidant pms concentration results in a deviation of the stoichiometric ratio from the optimal range in other words the oxidant becomes a limiting factor and this reduces the catalytic performance 3 3 2 effect of pms concentration given that pms is the core agent for ros production in the aop system the effect of pms concentration on ofl degradation by 0 4cf mt catalyst was determined as shown in fig 4 b and fig s7 b the concentration of pms had a significant impact on ofl removal efficiency when the initial pms concentration increased from 0 5 mm to 2 0 mm the ofl removal rate increased from 66 2 to 85 2 within 60 min whereas it barely increased from 2 0 mm to 4 0 mm this phenomenon could be explained as follows i a high concentration of so4 and oh was generated by activating pms eq s1 and these ros react with excess hso5 to form so5 lower oxidation potential ii excessive so4 and oh generated from the break down of pms bonds also undergo self quenching eqs s2 s3 46 47 resulting in the loss of free radicals in the system 3 3 3 effect of initial ph the ph value of a solution has a significant effect on the catalytic activity of the catalyst therefore the effect of initial ph on ofl degradation was also explored fig 4 c and fig s7 c the 0 4cf mt composite catalyst reached its optimal ofl degradation rate when the initial ph value of the reaction solution was 4 5 9 7 reaching a maximum degradation efficiency of 85 2 at ph 6 8 this was because the hydroxyl group on montmorillonite could neutralize part of the h under weakly acidic conditions and can therefore partially resist the influence of h additionally ion leaching could be inhibited under low h concentrations in this way 0 4cf mt maintains favorable removal activities in weakly alkaline solutions pms exists in the form of hso5 and so5 2 48 whereas part of the hso5 can interact with the active sites to generate ros thus improving ofl degradation efficiency when the initial ph was adjusted to strongly acidic ph 2 4 and strongly alkaline ph 11 5 conditions the corresponding degradation efficiency of ofl decreased to 65 7 and 70 5 respectively this could be due to the following reasons i under strong acid conditions h adsorbed onto the surface of hso5 and formed hydrogen bonds with oo bonds which inhibited its decomposition into so4 and oh via bond breakage 49 additionally the metal ions in the catalyst are easy to dissolve resulting in the loss of catalyst and a decrease in k obs ii in strongly alkaline conditions the pms in the solution generates so5 2 which repels the catalyst additionally the metal ions combined with oh in an alkaline environment could deposit on the montmorillonite surface thus forming hydroxide radicals 42 although ofl degradation efficiency may vary under different ph conditions this oxidation system still maintains high degradation ability in a wide ph range here it was determined that neutral ph conditions rendered optimal ofl degradation rates in the 0 4cf mt pms system 3 3 4 effect of co existing ions given that naturally occurring anions in water may affect the removal performance of organic pollutants the impacts of different concentrations of cl h2po4 and hco3 were investigated fig 4 d f in a previous study 26 the efficiency of atrazine degradation was inhibited by cl in a kaolinite pms system according to a previous study 50 the redox potentials of the chlorine reactive species generated after the reaction with cl are e0 cl hocl 1 48 v e0 cl cl2 2 2 v and e0 cl cl 2 5 v in fig 4 d and fig s8 a the degradation efficiency of ofl increased with higher cl concentrations in the 0 4cf mt pms system compared with the oxidation system without cl it was due to the generation of hocl cl2 eqs s4 s8 when pms reacted with cl 35 51 53 although the reaction of cl with free radicals generates active chlorine radicals cl the oxidizing capacity of cl is weaker than that of so4 and oh additionally chlorine radicals selectively react with specific pollutants and tend to preferentially attack electron rich compounds such as ofloxacin and enrofloxacin 54 55 active chlorine radicals can combine with unsaturated ofl bonds to generate adsorbed organic halides which promotes the decomposition of ofl on the catalyst surface 53 as illustrated in fig 4 e h2po4 possesses an inhibitory effect on degradation and this effect increases in a concentration dependent manner this may be because h2po4 is a potential ligand for transition metals and has a strong metal binding capacity further h2po4 not only competes for surface active sites with ofl but also forms complexes with metal ions by substituting hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface 56 when 10 mm hco3 was added to the system the degradation efficiency of the 0 4cf mt pms system on ofl was significantly reduced to 72 7 fig 4 f as the hco3 concentration was further enhanced the degree of ofl degradation inhibition become more obvious leading to a final degradation efficiency of 48 2 in this case hco3 likely reacts with so4 and oh thus generating the less reactive co3 eqs s9 s10 57 which in turn indirectly inhibits the progress of the degradation reaction additionally hco3 can directly react with pms to form hco4 as pms tends to attack nucleophilic molecules such as hco3 via oxygen atom transfer eq s11 3 4 catalyst reusability and ofl mineralization the stability and reusability of the 0 4cf mt composite catalyst are crucial for its practical application therefore cyclic degradation experiments were performed on 0 4cf mt under the same conditions as shown in fig 5 and fig s9 0 4cf mt maintained good catalytic activity even after three use cycles with only a slight decrease in removal efficiency from 85 2 to 72 9 this could be due to three reasons i the metal leaching on the catalyst surface after repeated tests led to a gradual decrease in metal active sites ii the valence state of the metal sites on the catalyst increased after undergoing multiple catalytic reactions causing the deactivation of the catalytic site iii the generated intermediate products would be adsorbed on the catalyst surface and hinder the occurrence of surface reactions thus reducing the ofl removal rate as illustrated in fig s10 the leaching copper ions in the 0 4cf mt pms system increased from 0 18 mg l to 0 31 mg l whereas iron ion leaching only increased from 0 05 mg l to 0 09 mg l which may be related to the fe o al bond formed by fe and montmorillonite this result is consistent with the xps analysis to evaluate the ofl mineralization ability of the 0 4cf mt pms system the total organic carbon toc of the reaction solution was tested it can be seen from fig s11 the toc value in the ofl solution decreased rapidly from 25 71 mg l to 14 69 mg l within 10 min mineralization rate 42 8 when the reaction time reached 60 min ofl degradation in the solution reached its end and the measured toc value was 11 62 mg l mineralization rate 54 8 this is because that aop technology can achieve partial mineralization of organic compounds thus leaving small molecular intermediates in the subsequent reaction this phenomenon has been widely described in previous studies 58 59 3 5 mechanisms of ofl degradation 3 5 1 reactive oxygen species next a radical quenching experiment was conducted to investigate the dominant ros species in the 0 4cf mt pms system given the differences in the reaction rates of the quencher depending on active species table s3 etoh is often used to quench so4 and oh whereas tba can effectively remove oh 60 as illustrated in fig 6 a and fig s12 a approximately 85 2 of ofl was removed by 0 4cf mt pms system in the absence of a quencher when the etoh concentration increased to 1 0 2 0 m ofl degradation was significantly inhibited and k obs decreased to 0 0071 min 1 in contrast fig 6 b and fig s12 b show that the increase of tba dosage have a negligible effect on the 0 4cf mt pms degradation system when tba 2 0 m was added to the reaction system the degradation efficiency of ofl only decreased to 68 2 therefore the results of free radical quenching experiments indicated that so4 and oh co existed in the 0 4cf mt pms system because etoh has a more obvious inhibitory effect than tba it can be confirmed that the free radical pathway so4 and oh dominated the 0 4cf mt pms system 3 5 2 epr test to determine the ros involved in the 0 4 cf mt pms system during the ofl degradation process epr experiments were conducted with dmpo and temp as capture agents as illustrated in fig 7 a no free radical signals were detected in the dmpo or dmpo pms system indicating that free radicals would not be produced in the absence of the catalyst when 0 4cf mt was added to the dmpo pms solution system the characteristic signal peaks of dmpo oh intensity ratio 1 2 2 1 and dmpo so4 intensity ratio 1 1 1 1 1 1 were detected indicating that the introduction of the catalyst efficiently activated pms resulting in the production of so4 and oh with high concentrations 36 after adding both the catalyst and ofl the so4 and oh produced in the system attacked the ofl thus decreasing dmpo mediated radical capture it is further confirmed that so4 and oh are the main ros for ofl degradation in the 0 4 cf mt pms system as illustrated in fig 7 b 1o2 signals were not detected in the temp or temp pms condition however when 0 4cf mt was added to the temp pms solution system the intensity ratio of the detected peak was 1 1 1 thus confirming that introducing the catalyst resulted in partial 1o2 production furthermore the signal peak of temp 1o2 in the system remained unchanged after further addition of ofl indicating that 1o2 does not take part in the ofl degradation process in the 0 4cf mt pms system consequently it was concluded that no non radical pathways were involved in the reaction system 3 6 catalytic mechanisms to further confirm the structure of the active sites the surface elements of 0 4cf mt before and after reaction were analyzed via xps the characteristic peaks of cu 2p fe 2p o 1s si 2p and al 2p were detected in the xps spectra of the 0 4cf mt both before and after use the o1s spectra fig 8 a and fig s13 indicated that the relative intensity of the characteristic peaks corresponding to the surface hydroxyl groups increased whereas the relative content of adsorbed h2o decreased this was likely because the adsorbed h2o on the montmorillonite surface participated in the formation of more oh 21 61 additionally the lattice oxygen content coordinated with the metal also dropped which was related to the breaking of the oxygen bond after pms activation on the metal site further as illustrated in fig 8 b the intensity of the cu 2p peak decreased slightly due to the consumption of the cu ii site of the 0 4cf mt catalyst after use regarding the fe 2p spectra fig 8 c the intensity of the fe ii peak decreased only slightly conversely the intensity of the fe iii peak increased which may be attributed to the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii by pms the mechanism of pms activation by 0 4cf mt can be explained as follows eqs s12 s16 cu ii can combine with hso5 to form high valence cu iii and generate so4 moreover cu iii and fe ii undergo redox reactions accompanied by cu ii and fe iii generation 35 fe iii could have also reacted with pms to generate fe ii and so5 after which pms further reacted with fe ii to form fe iii and so4 51 62 a schematic diagram of the putative mechanisms of pms activation by 0 4cf mt is illustrated in fig 9 to further confirm the above inferred catalytic mechanisms and clarify the deactivation mechanism of the catalyst various characterizations of the catalyst were performed after repeated use as shown in fig s14 the intensity of the characteristic peak intensity for cufe2o4 decreased markedly with increased use cycles due to the oxidation reduction reaction between iron ions and copper ions however the bet characterization results table s4 indicated that the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalyst decreased after four cycles the adsorption of unmineralized ofl on the catalyst surface obstructed the pores and active sites resulting in a reduction of the degradation efficiency after repeated use as indicated by the xps spectra fig s15 and table s5 the content of cu ii and fe ii decreased slightly with repeated use with a more obvious loss of cu ii this was consistent with the formation of fe o al bonds and metal leaching results by combining montmorillonite and cufe2o4 the synthesized cf mt achieved a far superior catalytic performance than both of its components in isolation this study thus offers a simple and economical method for the nanoscale preparation of a cufe2o4 based catalyst which could be scaled up for application in polluted water remediation however the application of the cf mt pms process at an industrial scale requires combining technologies to achieve a stable operation 63 for example a fluidized bed reactor could be introduced to serve as a supporting reaction device this would enhance reactor mixing and the utilization rate of the catalysts required for pms activation furthermore combining the cf mt pms process with membrane technology would also enhance the applicability of the proposed procedure therefore establishing combined processes will be an important step to scale up the cf mt pms process 4 conclusions cufe2o4 was successfully loaded onto the surface of montmorillonite which was confirmed via xrd bet sem eds tem and xps characterization the specific surface area of the ncf mt composite catalyst was much higher than that of c mt and cufe2o4 alone 0 4cf mt possesses excellent pore structure abundant catalytic sites and good magnetic properties 11 16 emu g which are conducive to its effective ofl degradation performance and rapid recovery using a magnet under the conditions of 40 mg l ofl concentration 0 4 g l catalyst dosage 2 0 mm pms concentration and ph 6 8 the ultimate removal efficiency of ofl by 0 4cf mt pms system is 85 2 the cl in the reaction solution promotes the degradation efficiency of ofl conversely h2po4 and hco3 had a negative effect on ofl removal the stability and reusability of the 0 4cf mt were confirmed by repeated degradation experiments the quenching experiment verified that the 0 4cf mt pms system mainly oxidized and decomposed ofl through the free radical pathway dominated by so4 and oh which was confirmed by the epr test as the reaction time increased the degree of ofl mineralization was improved resulting in a final mineralization efficiency of 54 8 upon comparing the xps spectra of 0 4cf mt before and after use the characteristic peak intensity corresponding to the surface hydroxyl group increased whereas the peak intensity of cu ii and fe ii decreased slightly indicating that pms was activated by cu ii and fe ii sites on 0 4cf mt in turn this resulted in the generation of so4 and oh species that ultimately attacked and oxidized ofl this study thus provides novel strategies for the design of a cost effective and highly efficient montmorillonite based bimetallic oxide catalyst for wastewater treatment that could be employed to remove antibiotics from polluted water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

13284,copper ferrite embedded in montmorillonite cufe2o4 montmorillonite cf mt was designed and employed as a composite catalyst for peroxymonosulfate pms activation to degrade ofloxacin ofl cufe2o4 characterization confirmed that this compound successfully dispersed on the surface of the montmorillonite cf mt loaded with 40 cufe2o4 0 4cf mt possessed favorable magnetic properties excellent pore structure and abundant catalytic sites obtaining the highest ofl degradation efficiency 85 2 in the presence of pms compared to other cf mt composites with different cufe2o4 loads influencing parameters including catalyst dosage pms concentration initial ph and co existing anions were also investigated high catalyst dosage and pms concentrations were found to favor ofl degradation the optimum ph in the 0 4cf mt pms system for ofl removal was 6 8 neutral ph additionally cl promoted ofl degradation performance whereas h2po4 and hco3 had the opposite effect radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrated that the ofl degradation in the 0 4cf mt pms system was largely attributed to free radical pathways dominated by so4 and oh ofl mineralization increased with reaction time finally reaching a mineralization rate of 54 8 furthermore 0 4cf mt maintained excellent catalytic activity after repeated use taken together this study provides a basis for the development of strategies to design bimetallic oxide catalysts for the efficient treatment of antibiotic contaminated wastewater with pms graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords montmorillonite based catalyst peroxymonosulfate advanced oxidation process ofloxacin free radical pathway 1 introduction antibiotics in wastewater cannot be easily treated due to their complex composition high toxicity and poor biodegradability therefore antibiotic water pollution poses a serious threat to human and ecosystem health 1 2 relevant studies have demonstrated that quinolone and tetracycline i e two commonly prescribed antibiotic types require higher oxidation potentials than other antibiotics to be completely degraded and therefore these compounds are uniquely persistent in environmental samples 3 4 ofloxacin ofl a third generation quinolone agent has a strong antibacterial effect on both gram positive and gram negative bacteria thus ofl consumption accounts for one fifth of global quinolone usage although antibiotics such as ofl occur at relatively low concentrations in water or wastewater these compounds can not only adversely affect ecological systems due to their chronic toxicity but also promote the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria via induction and selection processes 5 furthermore ofl may pose a considerable human health risk after long term exposure resulting in abdominal pain dizziness and numbness of limbs therefore developing novel and effective strategies to degrade quinolone antibiotics such as ofl has become an important priority for organic pollution control due to the antibacterial effects of antibiotics antibiotic contaminated wastewater is commonly treated with physical chemical methods such as adsorption 6 membrane separation 7 and flocculation 8 as well as advanced oxidation processes aops 9 however physical chemical methods cannot completely decompose pollutants by only separating antibiotics from the water whereas aops rapidly decompose organic pollutants by generating highly oxidizing free radicals through electron transfer hydrogen extraction or additive reactions aops have thus garnered increasing attention in the scientific community due to their many advantages including high oxidation efficiency low cost practicality and environmental friendliness peroxymonosulfate pms is an asymmetric oxidant whose asymmetric structure coupled with the strong electron accepting ability of so3 facilitates the shift of electrons between the oo bonds of pms and so3 this process breaks bonds and generates sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh 10 therefore pms has become one of the most common oxidants in aops ultraviolet light 11 ultrasound 12 heat 13 and transition metals metal oxides 14 15 are routinely used to activate pms and enhance its reactive oxygen species ros yields compared with the aforementioned technologies pms activation by transition metals and their oxides is more energy efficient 16 17 however this approach causes severe secondary pollution of metal leaching 18 which limits the practical applications of this method although the leaching rate of metal ions is relatively slow agglomerated metal oxide particles are not sufficiently active for pms activation due to a decrease in specific surface area and available catalytic sites therefore support structures are routinely employed to actively prevent particle aggregation qin et al 19 synthesized a femg biochar catalyst femgo bc through co precipitation and pyrolysis processes which they used to catalyze pms activation for sulfamethazine degradation similarly xu et al 20 introduced sepiolite as a support structure to synthesize a novel magnetic fe3o4 sepiolite composite via the co precipitation method which was used to activate persulfate to degrade atrazine moreover cofe2o4 dispersed on organic montmorillonite was synthesized through the hydrothermal method and exhibited favorable pms activation performance 21 however the aforementioned catalysts are relatively difficult to synthesize and are not sufficiently efficient for practical applications thus highlighting the need for more cost effective efficient and robust catalysts the bimetal oxide cufe2o4 possesses excellent synergistic pms activation ability when coupled with cufe in heterogeneous catalysis 22 zhang et al 23 reported that cufe2o4 was more active and exhibited a lower cu2 leaching rate than cuo under the same dosage consequently cufe2o4 is considered as an ideal metal oxide for pms activation owing to their low cost and chemical stability natural minerals have been proposed as an efficient material for catalyst preparation 24 particularly montmorillonite mt a layered silicate clay mineral is a promising adsorbent or catalyst carrier for environmental remediation 25 due to its excellent expansion capacity large specific surface area and high cation exchange capacity additionally montmorillonite can greatly facilitate cufe2o4 dispersion due to its permanent negative charge and abundant hydroxyl functional groups these properties together with the abundant hydroxyl functional groups of mt that act as active sites led us to explore whether these compounds could be used jointly for pms activation in this study a magnetic copper ferrite montmorillonite cufe2o4 montmorillonite cf mt composite catalyst was synthesized via the citrate combustion method by dispersing cufe2o4 on mt the prepared cf mt not only contained abundant hydroxyl functional groups but also enabled the formation of coordination bonds between cufe2o4 and montmorillonite which improved the stability of the catalyst and prevented the aggregation of cufe2o4 particles thus ensuring the exposure of catalytic sites additionally this study characterized the crystal structure specific surface area and elemental composition of cf mt as well as its ofl degradation efficiency under different reaction parameters lastly ros quenching experiments were conducted to identify the dominant mechanisms of ofl degradation after which the characteristics of cf mt were compared before and after the reaction 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the sodium based montmorillonite na mt used in this study was purchased from shandong province china ofloxacin 98 purity potassium

grade and purchased from chengdu kelong chemical co ltd 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was purchased from shanghai yuanye biotechnology co ltd all experiments were conducted using deionized di water 2 2 preparation of cufe2o4 mt as described in a previous study 26 cf mt was synthesized via a simple citrate combustion method the fabrication process is detailed in text s1 supporting information according to the different cufe2o4 loading ratios on the montmorillonite the samples were labeled as ncf mt where n represents the mass proportion of cufe2o4 in cf mt n 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 cufe2o4 samples were prepared through the same process for comparison na mt was also fabricated through calcination in a muffle furnace at 400 c and the product of this process is hereinafter referred to as c mt 2 3 experimental and analytical methods ofl degradation tests were conducted in an erlenmeyer flask 100 ml at 30 2 c predetermined amounts of pms and catalyst were added into the ofl solution 50 ml 40 mg l to initiate the reaction at selected time intervals 2 ml of the solution were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter membrane and used to analyze the remaining ofl concentration during the experiment etoh and tba were added as quenchers to assess the effect of ros the concentration of the ofl solution was determined via high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm text s2 supporting information describes the methods used to test and calculate the remaining ofl ratio in the solution as well as the degradation efficiency and first order kinetic rate constant of the reaction 2 4 characterization method the structural properties of the prepared materials were characterized using x ray diffraction analysis xrd specific

photoelectron spectroscopy xps to determine the mechanisms of ofl degradation the main ros in the system was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance epr using dmpo and temp as spin trapping agents more details on the characterization method are described in text s3 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the crystal structures of na mt c mt cufe2o4 and ncf mt were compared via xrd as illustrated in fig 1 a within a 2 75 scanning range the characteristic peaks of na mt at a 2θ of 7 70 21 18 26 96 35 36 54 62 and 62 22 corresponded with its 001 100 004 105 210 and 300 crystal planes among these a higher peak intensity of na mt relative to c mt was observed at the 001 plane which was attributed to the disappearance of interlayer water in montmorillonite after calcination 27 moreover the existence of the 100 plane indicated that the layered structure of montmorillonite had not been disrupted further the 2θ diffraction peaks of 18 51 30 45 35 86 38 74 43 94 58 19 and 62 53 were attributed to the 111 220 311 222 400 511 and 440 crystal planes of cufe2o4 jcpds no 34 0425 indicating the successful preparation of pure cufe2o4 28 additionally all ncf mt composite catalysts were composed of the crystalline structure of montmorillonite and cufe2o4 thus demonstrating their favorable combination as the cufe2o4 composition in the ncf mt composite increased the intensity of the cufe2o4 diffraction peak also increased gradually whereas the intensity of the corresponding diffraction peak of mt decreased gradually the amount of reaction centers and adsorption capacity of a heterogeneous catalyst are largely determined by its pore structure 29 30 pore structure can affect the probability of contact between the catalyst and its substrates e g pms or ofl and ultimately determines the adsorption capacity and catalytic properties of catalysts therefore the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of each sample were characterized in fig 1 b according to the iupac classification 31 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of each sample were similar in type belonging to the type iv isotherm adsorption curve and offering h3 hysteresis loops through capillary condensation indicating that the aggregation of flake particles results in the formation of many slit shaped channels 32 when p p 0 is close to 1 the adsorption curve of the n2 molecules in the external surface of the particles was slightly inverted due to agglomeration these results confirm the occurrence of multilayer adsorption and imply the existence of mesopores 33 compared with c mt and cufe2o4 the n2 adsorption capacity of the ncf mt sample increased significantly indicating that the adsorption performance of ncf mt improved according to fig s1 and table s1 the pore size distribution of each sample was between 2 and 50 nm indicating that the pore size of these samples was mainly mesoporous with a small proportion of micropores regarding the pore size distribution trends the pore size of c mt and ncf mt composites exhibited a peak value between 3 and 8 nm suggesting that mesopores played an important role and promoted the adsorption of pollutants by ncf mt 34 as indicated in table s1 the specific surface area of the ncf mt composite after modification was much higher than that of c mt and cufe2o4 thus confirming that this combination can greatly optimize the surface structure of the ncf mt this was because the large specific surface of cufe2o4 enabled this compound to be uniformly dispersed on the montmorillonite surface thus preventing cufe2o4 agglomeration and greatly increasing the specific surface area of ncf mt moreover compared with c mt cufe2o4 and other ncf mt composites 0 4cf mt had the highest specific surface area 97 120 m2 g the largest pore volume 0 1691 cm3 g and the smallest average pore size 6 105 nm this suggests that 0 4cf mt may be more efficient in adsorbing pms and ofl than other catalysts which facilitates the reaction between pms and the active sites on the catalytic material thus substantially improving ofl removal efficiency to further characterize the surface morphology of the synthesized material different samples were examined via sem analysis the calcined montmorillonite exhibited a smooth and well defined flake structure fig 1 c whereas cufe2o4 had a tetragonal phase structure with agglomeration fig 1 d as the cufe2o4 loads on the montmorillonite increased fig 1 e and fig s2 a d the montmorillonite surface gradually became rough indicating that the cufe2o4 was successfully loaded onto the montmorillonite cufe2o4 self aggregation occurred when the cufe2o4 loads on the montmorillonite surface exceeded 40 thus significantly reducing the available active sites as shown in fig 1 f the uniform dispersion of elements in 0 4cf mt further confirmed that the cufe2o4 was uniformly distributed on the montmorillonite surface the morphology and microstructure of c mt cufe2o4 and 0 4cf mt were determined via tem analysis as shown in fig 1 g the c mt catalyst had a layered structure with convoluted wrinkles on the edges which promoted the uniform distribution of cufe2o4 in the synthesis process in comparison cufe2o4 fig 1 h exhibited large and uneven sized particles which resulted in severe agglomeration and made it difficult for the particles to make full contact with the pollutants as illustrated in fig 1 i the cufe2o4 particles loaded on the montmorillonite lamellar surface were significantly smaller and evenly distributed suggesting that the active sites on the catalyst surface could be fully utilized the lattice fringes of 0 4cf mt with a d spacing of 0 251 nm and 0 294 nm as determined from the hrtem image fig 1 j were attributed to the 311 and 220 planes of cufe2o4 35 which was consistent with the xrd results xps characterization was then conducted to investigate the chemical states of each sample c mt cufe2o4 0 4cf mt al si o cu and fe signals were confirmed in the survey spectra of 0 4cf mt fig s3 where the presence of the c peak was ascribed to the introduced ambient c during the tests as seen in table s2 0 4cf mt was composed of elements from c mt and cufe2o4 which further confirmed the successful deposition of cufe2o4 on the montmorillonite fig 2 a illustrates the characteristic peaks of al si o cu and fe in 0 4cf mt both c mt and 0 4cf mt exhibited characteristic peaks at a binding energy of 74 6 ev which can be attributed to al2o3 or alo oh in the montmorillonite structure 26 33 in comparison the presence of a weak original peak 77 1 ev in the al 2p spectrum was potentially due to the formation of fe o al or cu o al bonds in 0 4cf mt in the si 2p region fig 2 b the peak at 102 8 ev in the spectra of c mt and 0 4cf mt was characteristic of the sio bond in the montmorillonite structure 26 indicating that the introduction of cufe2o4 did not change the sio bond of montmorillonite the o 1s spectra fig 2 c of c mt can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 532 2 ev and 531 7 ev which coincides with the surface adsorption of h2o and surface hydroxyl oh 37 regarding cufe2o4 the peak at 530 0 ev was assigned to lattice oxygen 38 39 the slight shift in the lattice oxygen peak 530 5 ev in 0 4cf mt could be ascribed to the formation of a new bond between mt and cufe2o4 compared with cufe2o4 a higher hydroxyl peak intensity was observed in 0 4cf mt with increased oxygen content which likely originated from the abundant oh in montmorillonite a previous study reported that oh can accelerate the dispersion of catalysts by increasing the effective reaction area between catalysts and pollutants thereby increasing the amount of active sites 35 additionally oh could not only generate oh on the montmorillonite surface by reacting with electrons but also enhanced the likelihood of ros generation by increasing the electron density and reducing the activation energy of oxidation and reduction reactions li et al 26 directly utilized kaolinite rich in hydroxyl groups to activate pms thus achieving atrazine removal rates of over 90 within 120 min therefore it can be inferred that cufe2o4 supported on montmorillonite would have a better catalytic performance the cu 2p spectrum fig s4 with binding energies of 933 4 ev and 936 0 ev was attributed to cu ii with satellite peaks at 941 0 ev and 943 1 ev the fe 2p spectrum fig 2 d exhibited typical double peaks of fe 2p with binding energies of approximately 711 ev and 724 ev corresponding to the fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 orbits 40 41 according to previous studies 42 43 the characteristic peak fixed at 709 3 ev was ascribed to fe ii whereas the peaks at 710 2 711 3 713 0 714 8 and 724 1 ev all correspond to fe iii with a satellite peak at 718 7 ev however compared with pure cufe2o4 the characteristic peak of 0 4cf mt shifted slightly to a higher binding energy in the fe spectrum further confirming that cufe2o4 was stably anchored on the montmorillonite surface due to the formation of fe o al bonds additionally the cu and fe content was significantly reduced relative to cufe2o4 indicating that loading cufe2o4 on montmorillonite promoted its uniform distribution to determine the recyclability of the prepared catalysts the magnetic properties of cufe2o4 and 0 4cf mt were characterized through h m hysteresis loop analysis fig s5 the saturation magnetization ms of cufe2o4 was determined to be 29 94 emu g indicating strong magnetism in contrast the ms of 0 4cf mt dropped to approximately 11 16 emu g due to the incorporation of montmorillonite a non magnetic material given its strong magnetism 0 4cf mt could be rapidly recovered from suspension within 30 s upon applying an external magnetic field fig s5 inset this property is advantageous for the rapid separation and recycling of the catalyst 3 2 adsorption and catalytic degradation of ofl this study also investigated the ofl adsorption properties of different samples fig 3 a montmorillonite based catalysts have a higher adsorption capacity compared to cufe2o4 alone with the better adsorption achieving in 0 2cf mt and 0 4cf mt reaching optimal adsorption this was likely because the interlayer and surface of montmorillonite possessed hydroxyl groups resulting in abundant adsorption sites moreover ofl could have been adsorbed onto the montmorillonite surface via electrostatic attraction or it could have otherwise occupied the montmorillonite space through ion exchange 44 45 although cufe2o4 has a large specific surface area it also has fewer adsorption sites and is prone to self agglomeration resulting in sub optimal ofl removal efficiency according to the bet characterization results 0 4cf mt possessed the largest specific surface area and pore volume and could thus provide a large number of active sites for ofl which greatly improved adsorption performance however when the cufe2o4 load levels on montmorillonite exceeded 40 the adsorption channels of cf mt were partially blocked by cufe2o4 leading to a decrease in active sites therefore the ofl adsorption capacities of 0 5cf mt and 0 6cf mt were significantly reduced the catalytic degradation performance of the synthesized material was further evaluated by adding pms into the reaction solution as shown in fig 3 b almost no ofl 3 1 was removed in the presence of pms only suggesting that pms itself barely oxidizes ofl in contrast pure cufe2o4 exhibited higher removal efficiency relative to its adsorption activity this can be attributed to the strong magnetism of cufe2o4 resulting in the uneven dispersion and inefficient contact with pms and ofl in the reaction solution furthermore the abundant hydroxyl groups and permanent negative charge of montmorillonite could slow down the crystallization process of cufe2o4 on the surface of montmorillonite this prevented the self aggregation of the catalyst and therefore more catalytic sites remained exposed on the surface of the material 21 at the same time the hydroxyl groups can also be used as reaction sites for pms activation resulting in ros production 26 at 60 min the ofl degradation efficiency of 0 2cf mt 0 3cf mt 0 4cf mt 0 5cf mt and 0 6cf mt reached 64 3 63 4 85 2 64 4 and 58 3 respectively the degradation dynamics of ofl were consistent with a first order kinetic model fig s6 the highest reaction rate constant was achieved at 0 4cf mt and therefore these conditions maximized the ofl degradation rate these results may be attributed to the higher specific surface area larger pore volume and hydroxyl group abundance of 0 4cf mt coupled with the uniform fixation of cufe2o4 particles thus accelerating the catalytic reaction process compared to adsorption and degradation activities it is found that although 0 2cf mt and 0 4cf mt had strong ofl adsorption capacities the degradation performance of 0 2cf mt was inferior to that of 0 4cf mt this is because 0 2cf mt has a lower cufe2o4 load and a smaller specific surface area which results in fewer available active sites in a subsequent study the 0 4cf mt catalyst was used to explore the effect of environmental factors on ofl degradation in the 0 4cf mt pms system 3 3 effect of reaction parameters on ofl degradation the degradation performance of a catalyst not only depends on its physical and chemical properties but also the environmental factors therefore the effects of various parameters including catalyst dosage pms concentration initial ph value and co existing ions on the ofl degradation capacity of the 0 4cf mt pms system were systematically investigated 3 3 1 effect of catalyst dosage the influence of catalyst dosage on ofl removal was studied firstly fig 4 a and fig s7 a as illustrated in fig 4 a the degradation efficiency of ofl increased from 57 6 to 85 2 as the 0 4cf mt dosage increased from 0 2 g l to 0 4 g l increasing the catalyst concentration results in an obvious enhancement of available active sites which increased the likelihood of contact between the catalyst and pms in turn this improves ofl degradation performance due to an increase in ros generation however the ofl removal rate increased only slightly when the 0 4cf mt dosage was increased to 0 3 g l this was likely because catalysts tend to agglomerate at high concentrations in which case the active sites cannot be effectively utilized only increasing the amount of catalyst without improving the oxidant pms concentration results in a deviation of the stoichiometric ratio from the optimal range in other words the oxidant becomes a limiting factor and this reduces the catalytic performance 3 3 2 effect of pms concentration given that pms is the core agent for ros production in the aop system the effect of pms concentration on ofl degradation by 0 4cf mt catalyst was determined as shown in fig 4 b and fig s7 b the concentration of pms had a significant impact on ofl removal efficiency when the initial pms concentration increased from 0 5 mm to 2 0 mm the ofl removal rate increased from 66 2 to 85 2 within 60 min whereas it barely increased from 2 0 mm to 4 0 mm this phenomenon could be explained as follows i a high concentration of so4 and oh was generated by activating pms eq s1 and these ros react with excess hso5 to form so5 lower oxidation potential ii excessive so4 and oh generated from the break down of pms bonds also undergo self quenching eqs s2 s3 46 47 resulting in the loss of free radicals in the system 3 3 3 effect of initial ph the ph value of a solution has a significant effect on the catalytic activity of the catalyst therefore the effect of initial ph on ofl degradation was also explored fig 4 c and fig s7 c the 0 4cf mt composite catalyst reached its optimal ofl degradation rate when the initial ph value of the reaction solution was 4 5 9 7 reaching a maximum degradation efficiency of 85 2 at ph 6 8 this was because the hydroxyl group on montmorillonite could neutralize part of the h under weakly acidic conditions and can therefore partially resist the influence of h additionally ion leaching could be inhibited under low h concentrations in this way 0 4cf mt maintains favorable removal activities in weakly alkaline solutions pms exists in the form of hso5 and so5 2 48 whereas part of the hso5 can interact with the active sites to generate ros thus improving ofl degradation efficiency when the initial ph was adjusted to strongly acidic ph 2 4 and strongly alkaline ph 11 5 conditions the corresponding degradation efficiency of ofl decreased to 65 7 and 70 5 respectively this could be due to the following reasons i under strong acid conditions h adsorbed onto the surface of hso5 and formed hydrogen bonds with oo bonds which inhibited its decomposition into so4 and oh via bond breakage 49 additionally the metal ions in the catalyst are easy to dissolve resulting in the loss of catalyst and a decrease in k obs ii in strongly alkaline conditions the pms in the solution generates so5 2 which repels the catalyst additionally the metal ions combined with oh in an alkaline environment could deposit on the montmorillonite surface thus forming hydroxide radicals 42 although ofl degradation efficiency may vary under different ph conditions this oxidation system still maintains high degradation ability in a wide ph range here it was determined that neutral ph conditions rendered optimal ofl degradation rates in the 0 4cf mt pms system 3 3 4 effect of co existing ions given that naturally occurring anions in water may affect the removal performance of organic pollutants the impacts of different concentrations of cl h2po4 and hco3 were investigated fig 4 d f in a previous study 26 the efficiency of atrazine degradation was inhibited by cl in a kaolinite pms system according to a previous study 50 the redox potentials of the chlorine reactive species generated after the reaction with cl are e0 cl hocl 1 48 v e0 cl cl2 2 2 v and e0 cl cl 2 5 v in fig 4 d and fig s8 a the degradation efficiency of ofl increased with higher cl concentrations in the 0 4cf mt pms system compared with the oxidation system without cl it was due to the generation of hocl cl2 eqs s4 s8 when pms reacted with cl 35 51 53 although the reaction of cl with free radicals generates active chlorine radicals cl the oxidizing capacity of cl is weaker than that of so4 and oh additionally chlorine radicals selectively react with specific pollutants and tend to preferentially attack electron rich compounds such as ofloxacin and enrofloxacin 54 55 active chlorine radicals can combine with unsaturated ofl bonds to generate adsorbed organic halides which promotes the decomposition of ofl on the catalyst surface 53 as illustrated in fig 4 e h2po4 possesses an inhibitory effect on degradation and this effect increases in a concentration dependent manner this may be because h2po4 is a potential ligand for transition metals and has a strong metal binding capacity further h2po4 not only competes for surface active sites with ofl but also forms complexes with metal ions by substituting hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface 56 when 10 mm hco3 was added to the system the degradation efficiency of the 0 4cf mt pms system on ofl was significantly reduced to 72 7 fig 4 f as the hco3 concentration was further enhanced the degree of ofl degradation inhibition become more obvious leading to a final degradation efficiency of 48 2 in this case hco3 likely reacts with so4 and oh thus generating the less reactive co3 eqs s9 s10 57 which in turn indirectly inhibits the progress of the degradation reaction additionally hco3 can directly react with pms to form hco4 as pms tends to attack nucleophilic molecules such as hco3 via oxygen atom transfer eq s11 3 4 catalyst reusability and ofl mineralization the stability and reusability of the 0 4cf mt composite catalyst are crucial for its practical application therefore cyclic degradation experiments were performed on 0 4cf mt under the same conditions as shown in fig 5 and fig s9 0 4cf mt maintained good catalytic activity even after three use cycles with only a slight decrease in removal efficiency from 85 2 to 72 9 this could be due to three reasons i the metal leaching on the catalyst surface after repeated tests led to a gradual decrease in metal active sites ii the valence state of the metal sites on the catalyst increased after undergoing multiple catalytic reactions causing the deactivation of the catalytic site iii the generated intermediate products would be adsorbed on the catalyst surface and hinder the occurrence of surface reactions thus reducing the ofl removal rate as illustrated in fig s10 the leaching copper ions in the 0 4cf mt pms system increased from 0 18 mg l to 0 31 mg l whereas iron ion leaching only increased from 0 05 mg l to 0 09 mg l which may be related to the fe o al bond formed by fe and montmorillonite this result is consistent with the xps analysis to evaluate the ofl mineralization ability of the 0 4cf mt pms system the total organic carbon toc of the reaction solution was tested it can be seen from fig s11 the toc value in the ofl solution decreased rapidly from 25 71 mg l to 14 69 mg l within 10 min mineralization rate 42 8 when the reaction time reached 60 min ofl degradation in the solution reached its end and the measured toc value was 11 62 mg l mineralization rate 54 8 this is because that aop technology can achieve partial mineralization of organic compounds thus leaving small molecular intermediates in the subsequent reaction this phenomenon has been widely described in previous studies 58 59 3 5 mechanisms of ofl degradation 3 5 1 reactive oxygen species next a radical quenching experiment was conducted to investigate the dominant ros species in the 0 4cf mt pms system given the differences in the reaction rates of the quencher depending on active species table s3 etoh is often used to quench so4 and oh whereas tba can effectively remove oh 60 as illustrated in fig 6 a and fig s12 a approximately 85 2 of ofl was removed by 0 4cf mt pms system in the absence of a quencher when the etoh concentration increased to 1 0 2 0 m ofl degradation was significantly inhibited and k obs decreased to 0 0071 min 1 in contrast fig 6 b and fig s12 b show that the increase of tba dosage have a negligible effect on the 0 4cf mt pms degradation system when tba 2 0 m was added to the reaction system the degradation efficiency of ofl only decreased to 68 2 therefore the results of free radical quenching experiments indicated that so4 and oh co existed in the 0 4cf mt pms system because etoh has a more obvious inhibitory effect than tba it can be confirmed that the free radical pathway so4 and oh dominated the 0 4cf mt pms system 3 5 2 epr test to determine the ros involved in the 0 4 cf mt pms system during the ofl degradation process epr experiments were conducted with dmpo and temp as capture agents as illustrated in fig 7 a no free radical signals were detected in the dmpo or dmpo pms system indicating that free radicals would not be produced in the absence of the catalyst when 0 4cf mt was added to the dmpo pms solution system the characteristic signal peaks of dmpo oh intensity ratio 1 2 2 1 and dmpo so4 intensity ratio 1 1 1 1 1 1 were detected indicating that the introduction of the catalyst efficiently activated pms resulting in the production of so4 and oh with high concentrations 36 after adding both the catalyst and ofl the so4 and oh produced in the system attacked the ofl thus decreasing dmpo mediated radical capture it is further confirmed that so4 and oh are the main ros for ofl degradation in the 0 4 cf mt pms system as illustrated in fig 7 b 1o2 signals were not detected in the temp or temp pms condition however when 0 4cf mt was added to the temp pms solution system the intensity ratio of the detected peak was 1 1 1 thus confirming that introducing the catalyst resulted in partial 1o2 production furthermore the signal peak of temp 1o2 in the system remained unchanged after further addition of ofl indicating that 1o2 does not take part in the ofl degradation process in the 0 4cf mt pms system consequently it was concluded that no non radical pathways were involved in the reaction system 3 6 catalytic mechanisms to further confirm the structure of the active sites the surface elements of 0 4cf mt before and after reaction were analyzed via xps the characteristic peaks of cu 2p fe 2p o 1s si 2p and al 2p were detected in the xps spectra of the 0 4cf mt both before and after use the o1s spectra fig 8 a and fig s13 indicated that the relative intensity of the characteristic peaks corresponding to the surface hydroxyl groups increased whereas the relative content of adsorbed h2o decreased this was likely because the adsorbed h2o on the montmorillonite surface participated in the formation of more oh 21 61 additionally the lattice oxygen content coordinated with the metal also dropped which was related to the breaking of the oxygen bond after pms activation on the metal site further as illustrated in fig 8 b the intensity of the cu 2p peak decreased slightly due to the consumption of the cu ii site of the 0 4cf mt catalyst after use regarding the fe 2p spectra fig 8 c the intensity of the fe ii peak decreased only slightly conversely the intensity of the fe iii peak increased which may be attributed to the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii by pms the mechanism of pms activation by 0 4cf mt can be explained as follows eqs s12 s16 cu ii can combine with hso5 to form high valence cu iii and generate so4 moreover cu iii and fe ii undergo redox reactions accompanied by cu ii and fe iii generation 35 fe iii could have also reacted with pms to generate fe ii and so5 after which pms further reacted with fe ii to form fe iii and so4 51 62 a schematic diagram of the putative mechanisms of pms activation by 0 4cf mt is illustrated in fig 9 to further confirm the above inferred catalytic mechanisms and clarify the deactivation mechanism of the catalyst various characterizations of the catalyst were performed after repeated use as shown in fig s14 the intensity of the characteristic peak intensity for cufe2o4 decreased markedly with increased use cycles due to the oxidation reduction reaction between iron ions and copper ions however the bet characterization results table s4 indicated that the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalyst decreased after four cycles the adsorption of unmineralized ofl on the catalyst surface obstructed the pores and active sites resulting in a reduction of the degradation efficiency after repeated use as indicated by the xps spectra fig s15 and table s5 the content of cu ii and fe ii decreased slightly with repeated use with a more obvious loss of cu ii this was consistent with the formation of fe o al bonds and metal leaching results by combining montmorillonite and cufe2o4 the synthesized cf mt achieved a far superior catalytic performance than both of its components in isolation this study thus offers a simple and economical method for the nanoscale preparation of a cufe2o4 based catalyst which could be scaled up for application in polluted water remediation however the application of the cf mt pms process at an industrial scale requires combining technologies to achieve a stable operation 63 for example a fluidized bed reactor could be introduced to serve as a supporting reaction device this would enhance reactor mixing and the utilization rate of the catalysts required for pms activation furthermore combining the cf mt pms process with membrane technology would also enhance the applicability of the proposed procedure therefore establishing combined processes will be an important step to scale up the cf mt pms process 4 conclusions cufe2o4 was successfully loaded onto the surface of montmorillonite which was confirmed via xrd bet sem eds tem and xps characterization the specific surface area of the ncf mt composite catalyst was much higher than that of c mt and cufe2o4 alone 0 4cf mt possesses excellent pore structure abundant catalytic sites and good magnetic properties 11 16 emu g which are conducive to its effective ofl degradation performance and rapid recovery using a magnet under the conditions of 40 mg l ofl concentration 0 4 g l catalyst dosage 2 0 mm pms concentration and ph 6 8 the ultimate removal efficiency of ofl by 0 4cf mt pms system is 85 2 the cl in the reaction solution promotes the degradation efficiency of ofl conversely h2po4 and hco3 had a negative effect on ofl removal the stability and reusability of the 0 4cf mt were confirmed by repeated degradation experiments the quenching experiment verified that the 0 4cf mt pms system mainly oxidized and decomposed ofl through the free radical pathway dominated by so4 and oh which was confirmed by the epr test as the reaction time increased the degree of ofl mineralization was improved resulting in a final mineralization efficiency of 54 8 upon comparing the xps spectra of 0 4cf mt before and after use the characteristic peak intensity corresponding to the surface hydroxyl group increased whereas the peak intensity of cu ii and fe ii decreased slightly indicating that pms was activated by cu ii and fe ii sites on 0 4cf mt in turn this resulted in the generation of so4 and oh species that ultimately attacked and oxidized ofl this study thus provides novel strategies for the design of a cost effective and highly efficient montmorillonite based bimetallic oxide catalyst for wastewater treatment that could be employed to remove antibiotics from polluted water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
