9815,agricultural water demand may dynamically vary as socioeconomic characteristics of farmers evolve reservoir operation under dynamic demand has a quite new origin this paper employs an agent based model abm in combination with the standard reservoir operating policy sop proposed framework abm sop simulates a dynamic long term reservoir operation considering the variations of agricultural water demand as socioeconomic behaviors of farmers evolves in the proposed abm farmers are assumed to have memory and individual characteristics that make exclusive decisions based on their knowledge about the prevailing conditions farmers water demand varies dynamically with their main socioeconomic characteristics addressed by their age education risk taking ability and dependency on agricultural income farmers respond to amount of available water by changing the cropping pattern and irrigation technology without any obligation from policymakers results of this study indicate that first through the dynamic interaction between farmers and reservoir operators water stress experienced by farmers is reduced by about 50 they gain 20 more profit by making adapted decisions under different circumstances second the most critical factor influencing the farmers responses is risk taking rate that might be managed to increase flexibility of farmers in their decisions third a bottom up approach applied in this research shows that selfish farmers could be smart enough to make proper decisions in response to fluctuation in available water as a result of self organizing ability i e ability of individual agents to organize their collective behaviors through interacting with each other rather than external intervention or education of complex human natural systems farmers would balance their risk taking status based on their education and as they receive information on reservoir storage and water availability for allocation so policymakers can improve the efficiency of their decisions by promoting the information exchange with all stakeholders and parties involved in the system operation keywords dynamic demand reservoir operation agent based modeling abm agricultural

the u n 2016 giuliani et al 2016 farmers must adapt themselves to the threat of water scarcity to attain food security and prevent corps destruction aghaie et al 2020 turral et al 2011 understanding farmers behavior in irrigated agriculture may help to reduce existing tensions on water resources increase sustainability and adaptability to climate change buelow and cradock henry 2018 feola et al 2015 pouladi et al 2020 2019 agriculture is a social cultural endeavor and farmers may behave differently depending on their financial status age agricultural knowledge adaptability to changes and size of their farm land vanclay 2004 it has been argued that in any reservoir operation for irrigation farmers heterogeneity should be considered as farmers with the same farmland acreage on the same type of climate and water availability can decide differently on their rate of withdraw and application noel and cai 2017 all farmers may not equally seek to maximize their profits in the same sense and their perceptions may affect their final decisions giuliani et al 2016 each farmer based on his her characteristic develops a perception of the existing condition and changes his her behavior based on such understanding and attributes arunrat et al 2017 complex human natural systems are under threat of destruction as a result of exploitative users however according to adam smith selfish agents could improve the social benefit of complex systems by changing this threat to an opportunity smith 2008 in other words complex systems in relation to humans are self organized which means that individual agents can organize their collective behaviors through reproducing the socioeconomic community increasing communication and information sharing between involved parties rather than external intervention or education krugman 1996 luhmann 1995 von hayek 1978 agent based modeling abm is a practical method for simulating complex systems with socioeconomic status mitchell 2009 they are characterized by autonomous adaptable and heterogeneous agents having the ability to adapt to changing conditions each autonomous agent tries to achieve its own goals by changing their behavior based on current conditions as well as the behavior of other agents i e farmers and the environment in abms although the aggregation of agents behaviors is simple the results are rarely predictable castilla rho 2017 mashhadi ali et al 2017 railsback and grimm 2019 although abm in socioeconomic environmental systems suffer from lack of validation and difficulties in formulation of agents behaviors berglund 2015 edwards et al 2005 yang et al 2009 researches conducted in abm gain a lot of achievements in modeling of complex human natural systems noel and cai 2017 abms has been used successfully as a complex system simulator in science and engineering matthews et al 2007 mustafa et al 2017 in agricultural water management some researches are carried out on integrating farmers with different water resources in the field of groundwater management different subjects such as cooperative and non cooperative behavior of farmers optimal crop pattern effects of farmers educations penalties incentives and policy makers limitations have been examined farhadi et al 2016 noel and cai 2017 also irrigation strategies and water sensitivity of farmers in the face of water shortage have been evaluated in the management of river basins du et al 2017 pérez et al 2016 in the management of integrated water basins importance of cooperative behavior of farmers and evaluating the sequential water stress have been discussed akhbari and grigg 2015 van oel et al 2010 reservoir operation strategies to reduce floods and agricultural water stress have been evaluated through changing crop pattern giuliani et al 2016 in most of these researches however farmers are directly or indirectly controlled by the policy makers an assumption which is not materialized in practice assumptions made in these papers on the farmers behaviors for example being cooperative having the ability to choose optimal crop pattern getting education having the ability to improve irrigation strategies and technologies are assumed a priori to be dictated by policy makers however each farmer is an autonomous human agent and wise in his her point of view and different from others also can behave different from those assumed by the researchers of the field railsback and grimm 2019 successful modeling of human natural system should consider socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers and assess its outcome in the form of threats or opportunities this paper introduces an agent based framework with the aim of operating a reservoir for irrigated agriculture with dynamic demand resulting from the farmers socioeconomic characteristics the proposed methodology benefits from farmers heterogeneity in age income education level risk taking and memory retrieval and updating socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers used here are taken from psychological studies on agricultural systems cancian 1967 jianakoplos and bernasek 2006 kahan 2008 knight et al 2003 spicka 2020 in this research farmers decide plan and act upon their own socioeconomic characteristics toward maximizing their objectives whereas most previous studies with abms try to control farmers behavior in the direction of project goals the proposed framework shows that self organizing ability of complex systems in a human based agricultural environment including a reservoir to provide water this model ends up with voluntarily and dynamically changing demand in contrast to common methods of reservoir operation where demand is either constant or pre specified in the planning horizon reservoir operation is carried out using the standard operating policy sop method as the agent based model evolves in this framework farmers change their crop pattern cropland area and crop type and irrigation technology in the face of the available water to each agent reservoir is re operated and new release is scheduled based on the perspective demand resulting from the farmers behavioral changes dynamic and mutual interactions between farmers and reservoir manager provides a more realistic scenario for operating the reservoir considering both the technical and socioeconomic issues the aggregation of both exploitative groups i e farmers and policy makers behaviors is examined in this research to show the self organizing ability of human agricultural systems performance of the proposed model is tested using hydrologic data from dez reservoir in iran data on farmers heterogeneity is not specific to the local area and are partially borrowed from other researchers pouladi et al 2020 2019 2 materials and approaches this research intends to present a novel reservoir operation model for agricultural irrigation considering the socioeconomic behavior of the farmers in this paper unique and autonomous agents are applied to show the self organizing ability of a complex human natural system where the agents are not obliged to obey policy makers orders and try to exploit the resources two main groups of agents farmers and reservoir operators are applied to this model more details in 2 1 section farmers and reservoir operators as main agents in this research decide upon their personal interests interact with each other and share information following their own benefit the abm technique is employed for modeling farmers behavior and standard operating policy sop is used to operate the reservoir while the demand is updating the reservoir water demand is dynamically refined based on farmers heterogeneity addressed by their socioeconomic statuses farmers also react to the available water through changing crop patterns and irrigation technology assumed as an innovation in the farmers community using rogers diffusion of innovation theory rogers 1995 in this research farmers income dependency on agriculture and their ages are used for determining their risk taking degree according to fao and psychological studies on agricultural risk cancian 1967 jianakoplos and bernasek 2006 kahan 2008 knight et al 2003 spicka 2020 which also applied in previous researches this risk taking factor influences the farmers perception of the amount of water available to them along with their education level as parameters for introducing agents heterogeneity in this model farmers have memory and their past actions have an impact on their decisions farmers may also affect the behavior of their neighbors in changing their agricultural system in response to available water autonomous farmers may change their crop pattern i e the type of crop and the cropping area of each harvest and the irrigation technology willingly instead of imperatively 2 1 agent based model the agents in this research are signified by farmers reservoir operators and government agency each agent tries to behave according to their goals these agents interact with one another and their counterpart s behavior influences the rest the conceptual relationship between these agents is illustrated in fig 1 the government agency is a simple agent and just provides loans to farmers detailed characteristics of farmers and reservoir operators are discussed in sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 respectively 2 1 1 farmers features and decisions 2 1 1 1 farmers heterogeneous features as shown in table 1 farmers are differentiated from each other by age range from 20 to 90 years income dependence on agriculture range from 0 to 100 and the level of education high or low educated affecting farmers decisions balbi et al 2013 ghazali et al 2018 schreinemachers and berger 2011 in order to simplify the model three characteristics are assumed fixed during the time farmers age and income dependency on agriculture are used for determining their risk taking level according to fao and psychological studies on agricultural risk cancian 1967 jianakoplos and bernasek 2006 kahan 2008 knight et al 2003 spicka 2020 this risk factor influences the farmers perception of the amount of water available to them accordingly young farmers with lower income dependency on agriculture are more risk taker than others balbi et al 2013 here a farmer aged 20 with zero percent income dependency on agriculture is considered as the agent with the highest risk taker rating of one a farmer aged 90 with 100 income dependency on agriculture is identified as a risk averse farmer with risk rating of zero the rest of the farmers are rated using two dimensional linear interpolation eq 1 1 α i y f incdep i y age i y 90 age i y 2 100 incdep i y 2 90 20 2 100 0 2 in eq 1 α age and incdep are risk taking level farmer s age and percentage of farmer s income dependency on agriculture respectively the superscript y represents the time year subscripts i represents farmer s number in the model for example the risk taking level of a farmer agent 12 in each year y is a function of farmer s age age 31 as well as farmer s income dependency on agriculture incdep 13 and is equal to 0 86 α which can be seen in the grey cell in table 1 proposed farmers have memory and their past actions have an impact on their decisions as well as their socioeconomic features farmers may also affect the behavior of their neighbors in changing their agricultural system in response to available water autonomous farmers may change their annual crop pattern i e type and cultivated area of each crop and the irrigation technology through the proposed decision making process willingly without any obligation to test the performance of the proposed modeling scheme an agricultural district with 350 000 ha of irrigated agriculture is assumed the farmers are classified into 20 groups as cognitive agents as illustrated in table 1 farmers decide on their future status based on the existing condition and according to their characteristics as addressed in fig 1 to feed the model with the farmers historical memory the first 5 years is treated as initial condition with the traditional and locally dominant cropping patterns and irrigation technology figs 2 3 from 6th year onwards the abm is used to refine the farmers demand and associated reservoir release by the operator 2 1 1 2 farmers decisions for order to simplification this study restricts the farmers behavioral options to change in cropping pattern and irrigation technology only farmers are assumed to change their cropping pattern and enhance their irrigation technology according to their social characteristics as discussed in the following sections 2 1 1 2 1 process of changing the cropping pattern this study considers cucumber watermelon maize and beans as commonly cultivated crops in the area growing seasons and associated water requirement for each potential crop is presented in table 2 the study assumes that the total of 17 500 ha which is available land area for each farmer is equally allocated to the four potential crops for the first five years i e 4 crop combination with 0 non cropping as presented in fig 2a therefore initially 4375 ha is allocated to each crop including cucumber watermelon maize and beans for each farmer to create historical memory necessary for them to decide on the future farmers are considered as cognitive agents that behave based on analyzing the available data and information to maximize their profits farmers make their initial decisions based on the amount of available water as expected each year more importantly these decisions are based on farmers characteristics and their perspectives on maximizing profits which may vary from one farmer to another each farmer may show rational behavior from their own points of view arunrat et al 2017 noel and cai 2017 schreinemachers and berger 2011 as mentioned before farmers are not obliged to improve their crop pattern in order to reduce water stress they are free in their decision making process and can be consumerist or water saver each farmer decides on the cropping pattern based on their memory affected their loss of profits and required water flow of information for selecting cropping pattern by a farmer is presented in fig 2 according to edwards et al 2005 the degree of economic and practical superiority of the individual farmer s decision compared to the group decision over the short term and long term decision history is calculated by binary parameters p1 p2 p3 and p4 eqs 2 5 as defined in eqs 2 3 p1 and p2 show how each individual farmer values their short term and long term decisions economically in comparison with their neighbors respectively for instance if each farmer gain more profit than his her neighbors in the last five year s p1 p2 is equal to 1 otherwise is zero according to eqs 4 5 p3 p4 indicates how each all farmer s assesses the accuracy of their short term estimation about their available water in comparison with their long term estimations for instance if the ratio between requested water and available water for each all farmer s is lower than this ratio in last 5 years p3 p4 is equal to 1 otherwise is equal to zero 2 p 1 i y sign max 0 p r o f i t i y 1 i 1 n f p r o f i t i y 1 n f y y 5 3 p 2 i y sign max 0 y y 5 y 1 profit i y y y 5 y 1 i 1 nf profit i y nf y y 5 4 p 3 i y sign

farmer has four patch of lands each 4375 ha and will only allocate one crop to each patch at a time under this assumption there are 23 potential crop combinations for land allocation as presented in fig 2a for the agents at the beginning farmers are to choose five crop combinations fig 2a in a way that their water demand is close to the farmer s expected available water farmerexp then farmers scrutinize five types of non cropping including 0 25 50 75 or 100 strategies in order to determine the cultivated area for each of the selected crops patterns in previous stage now farmers are faced with 25 options to select the most cost effective option based on their expected available water farmerexp by the end of this stage the type and the area of cultivation under each crop is calculated for each farmer 2 1 1 2 2 process of changing the irrigation technology at this stage the idea of changing to a more advanced irrigation technology is considered this enhancement in irrigation technology is considered as an innovation to the agents this innovation is evaluated based on roger s diffusion of innovations book one of the most prestigious theories in this field according to roger s the development of an innovation in a community is a multi stage process it includes knowledge acquisition for innovation personal perception of innovation decision making implementation and confirmation as stated by rogers 1995 it is a process that takes us from the basic knowledge of innovation to the road either to adapt or reject it and acts as an uncertainty reduction process in this research a simplified version of the rogers diffusion of innovation is implemented in line with the nature of the problem a proposed detailed flowchart of this process is presented in fig 3 as presented in fig 3 initially all farmers are following the traditional irrigation technology for the first five years however from the sixth year forward they are free to act upon their own decisions to adapt and implement the new irrigation technology related to psychological based socioeconomic features of farmers in this research it is assumed that the farmers may change to an advanced irrigation technology such as underground irrigation technique the traditional irrigation system and the new proposed one are assumed to have the same operational and maintenance cost and only the new technology requires an initial capital cost the irrigation efficiency of the primary and the new irrigation technology are assumed to be 0 6 and 0 8 respectively the diffusion of innovation is a multi step and threshold based process according to fig 3 the first step is referred to as knowledge in the diffusion of the innovation process this stage examines the situation under which farmers seek knowledge to reduce their water stress when the relative annual water stress exerted to farmers exceeds the threshold for their tolerance according to table a in fig 3 the knowledge stage is activated to reduce the water stress in the second step named persuasion farmers psychological and emotional perception of innovation is examined in terms of relative advantages compatibility and complexity of the new irrigation technology according to various agricultural psychological studies farmers who are more risk taker more educated and richer are persuaded more easily to take on new irrigation technology jianakoplos and bernasek 2006 kahan et al 2008 rogers 1995 according to table b in fig 3 each farmer receives a positive negative or neutral value regarding their perception about the new irrigation technology that represent their attitude towards innovation in the third step referred to the decision making phase the only farmer s self opinion i e persuasion in step 2 affects farmer s decision the fourth step is the implementation phase that examines the financial constraints as another controlling factor in the process of adaptation to innovation farmers may decide to choose new irrigation technology unless they do not have the required financial ability to do so since the irrigation technology can be bought through loan farmers option is not limited by their available cash the final step is confirmation in which farmers who have been able to reduce their water stress by using of new irrigation technology would suggest it to their neighbors however for simplification purposes it i assumed here that farmer s neighbors don t have any effect on farmer s decision making process and farmers decide solely based on their assessment it should be noted that this research uses a simplified model of rogers diffusion of innovation methodology which could be different for other cases 2 1 1 2 3 rate of revenue cost and profit based on the availability of water eqs 11 and

a suitable arrangement for the operation of the reservoir this agent is cognitive and it deals with the analysis of data and information this study employs the standard operation policy sop for reservoir operation for the long term operation of the reservoir a 40 year historical inflow to the reservoir is used reservoir s primary storage is assumed as 1430 mcm non agricultural monthly water demand is 191 7 mcm the maximum and minimum reservoir storage is equal to 3340 mcm and 830 mcm respectively 2 2 linking the farmers simulation model to the reservoir operating model the process of reservoir operation in response to farmers decisions is shown in the flowchart of fig 4 an abm is linked to a sop based reservoir operation during a 40 year simulation period referred to as abm sop to evaluate the performance of the proposed model abm sop the reservoir is operated by a traditional sop based model referred to as only sop and the results are presented and compared in the results section in only sop farmers water demand is assumed to be constant over the entire simulation period as common practice in abm sop however the effects of changing the cropping pattern and irrigation technology on water demand are applied simultaneously 3 results 3 1 comparison on a general scale temporal variation of agricultural demand over the 40 years of simulation with historical inflow is presented in fig 5 it shows the demand variation under 2 different scenario as identified earlier as only sop and abm sop to create farmers memory the water demand is kept constant at 5505 mcm in the first five years for all scenarios as addressed earlier the water requirement in the only sop is constant and does not correlate with the reservoir yield for instance total annual demand agriculture and non agriculture in this scenario is constant for each year equal to 5505 mcm in the abm sop annual demand has simultaneously been affected by possible variations in cropping pattern and adapting new irrigation technology abm sop is created through aggregating of changing crop pattern and irrigation technology to show how simultaneous overlap of simple behavior of farmers could affect this complex system in this case farmers have achieved more adaptation with the conditions and have been able to enhance their consumption patterns for instance the annual demand reaches to 4677 mcm in 27th year as a dry year and 5308 mcm in 30th year as wet year these examples show that the abm sop model is more flexible as mentioned before 27th year is dry and farmers should decrease their demand and 30th year is a wet one and farmers could increase their demand in both cases the abm sop achieves better result this indicates that aggregated scenario abm sop could reduce water demand and is also more flexible as mentioned before the cooperative behavior or consensus of the farmers are not forced in abm scenario and all agents behave exploitatively however according to smith 2008 aggregation of selfish behavior of agents in a complex human system could eventually benefit the system which is not the primary aim of the agents there is an inverse relation between the annual shortage volume and annual release from the reservoir as shown in fig 6 although the reservoir is designed for inter and intra annual regulation of inflowing water water shortage deficit mostly occur in dry years with low inflow to the reservoir as more enhanced scenario abm sop is adapted the overall volumes of shortage are reduced it can be seen on the results of abm sop that water shortages are much smaller for most years and that farmers bear less water stress compared to only sop in sum under abm sop farmers experience less water stress because of simultaneous adaptation to crop patterns and irrigation technologies while the pair of average annual water deficit and standard deviation in only sop is equal to 413 607 mcm it decreases to 190 330 mcm in abm sop it is obvious that as the flexibility of the model increases the volume of water deficit decreases besides in 27th year as a dry year adaptation of only sop results in significantly high deficit of 1577 mcm which far exceeds of abm sop and 27th year water deficit is reduced by 54 in abm sop 732 mcm water deficit is related to farmers decisions on crop pattern and irrigation technology so the more proper decisions farmers make the less water shortage they face due to higher level of flexibility of abm sop farmers decisions follows the inflow fluctuation more closely according to proposed model farmers will not only reduce their water consumption but also seek more profit in an exploitative manner surprisingly farmers profit seeking behavior leads to rational behaviors and reduce water deficit this emphasizes on the fact that exploitative behavior of agents is not a barrier in complex human natural systems and could benefit stakeholders through agents interactions time variation of the farmers annual profits from agriculture is presented in fig 7 as illustrated the annual variation in profit closely follows that of available water that may be attributed to the release form the reservoir and the farmers decision on managing their available water through adapting to different strategies fig 7 shows that the average annual profit for the two scenarios ranges from 2303 m to 2751 m for only sop and abm sop respectively accordingly the standard deviation of the annual profit ranges from 307 m to 423 m for only sop and abm sop respectively these statistical parameters show that the abm sop has greater profit in terms of not only the annual average but also the standard deviation according to what stated about water deficit in abm sop farmers are more flexible to adapt with different reservoir fluctuations indeed farmers water deficit in only sop is greater than abm sop as a result of farmers best adaptation so the profitability of farmers decision increase in abm sop it is observed that for almost entire simulation period of 40 years the annual profit for the only sop falls below other scenario fig 7 indicates the importance of considering the agents social behavior in agricultural water management and reservoir operations more specifically implementation of the abm sop leads to a significant increase in annual profit mostly due to its ability to adapt to the fluctuation in available water agents exploitative and profit seeking behavior is exploited by the model caused to both reduce water deficit and increase system profitability table 3 shows how diffusion of innovation evolves during the 40 years of simulation in abm sop the model is introduced according to different stages of rogers innovation theory and the results are consistent with previous research conducted in this study it is assumed that the agents may benefit from governmental loan to pay for the capital cost of implementing the new technology therefore the farmers features have a more significant role than financial status in the adaptation process according to table 3 high risk taking farmers with higher levels of education as innovators are more responsive to water deficit and more possibly adapt to new irrigation technology in this study the farmers 10 12 18 as young highly educated and risk taker farmers with low income dependency on agriculture are known as innovators and adapted to new irrigation technology in 7th year the next adaptation accrued in the 17th year by farmer 7 with a high rate of risk taking the remaining farmers do not adapt the new technology in their decision making process it means the lack the characteristics required for the proposed adaptation process in this research it should be noted that this research introduced a simplified model according to rogers diffusion of innovation methodology and this model could be different for other cases to sum up this section some informative and comparative results on only sop and abm sop are presented in table 4 it shows that under abm sop scenario farmers are using almost 9 2 less water compared to the business as usual only sop scenario the average annual water use is decreased by 510 mcm from 5505 to 4995 mcm although the total water use has considerably reduced the average annual profit from irrigated agriculture has increased by almost 20 from 2303 to 2751 m this is a very significant enhancement in water use efficiency and agricultural return all is happening without major change in cultivated land and no profit loss to agricultural sector as observed the average cultivated land is reduced by approximately 2 6 which accounts for 10 thousand hectares results presented in table 4 reveals that under abm sop scenario farmers have been able to cultivate less cropland and experience about 50 less shortage than the only sop condition farmers are reducing their water demand while they are gaining more profit by increasing flexibility in decision making due to enhancing irrigation efficiency and changing crop pattern based on experienced situations in abm sop there is not any top down rules to oblige farmers for decreasing water shortage or increasing system profitability and farmers have been tried to be modeled in a way that is realistic and based on their characteristics however it is seen that farmers change their behavior voluntarily and not coercive which can achieve a total profit level of about 20 this achievement is a result of the self organizing ability of human natural systems that can turn the threat of exploitative behavior of agents into an opportunity of more profitability and less water stress liu 2008 mitchell 2009 wolfram 1983 this research benefit from information sharing between farmers and reservoir operators leading to a comprehensive interaction between beneficiaries farmers in this study are not obliged to reduce their water consumption or water stress as ordered by the operators they are assumed free to make decisions willingly based on their own rational point of view which maybe irrational from others point of view 3 2 comparison on individual scale in this research farmers have not all behaved in the same way and they have not acted in the same common sense practically instead farmers have changed their behavior based on their characteristics and the rationale of the behavior is different from the perspective of each farmer and each person does something right from his her own point of view although it is not rational from the perspective of the operators and other farmers fig 8 is used to show the impact of the individual farmers behavior on their corresponding profits fig 8 shows the role of farmer s risk taking rate in their average annual profit in abm sop farmers overcome the water deficit in both changing crop pattern and irrigation technology although all farmers make decisions to increase their benefit not all are successful as others farmers with a low to medium risk taking rate 0 0 75 benefit more than farmers with a higher rate of risk taking 0 75 1 farmers with a high rate of risk taking would not benefit enough by improving the irrigation efficiency compared with low to medium risk taker farmers while risk taker farmers tend to use new irrigation technology the improvement made in irrigation efficiency leads to an additive effect on their misevaluation about their available water as shown in eq 8 this research shows numerically that risk taking in agricultural systems is not always beneficial as reported by fao kahan 2008 as mentioned before in abm sop farmers with a low and medium rate of risk taking are the most successful to gain profit by desirable violation from average available water in summary adopting new irrigation technology without in farm irrigation management and adapting new cropping patterns may impose capital cost and mortgage which may not even be compensated with the additional profit from water saving 4 discussion this study aimed to achieve a more realistic model to simulate socioeconomic farmers behavior for determining the reservoir release for agricultural applications in this research a new approach to reservoir operation was presented which can adapt to changes in the dynamic farmers water demand dynamic and mutual combining a sop and an abm is employed to determine the users variable water demand over a 40 year period the strength of this research in comparison with previous related studies is that farmers and reservoir operators are selfish and exploitative agents try to benefit from the progressive situation farmers in this model are not completely wise they act upon their psychological based socioeconomic features farmers decision making process aims to maximize their profit according to their perception of the situation and also none of them didn t care about other agents on the other hand reservoir operators just try to release water concerning reported demand by farmers these two group of agents i e farmers and reservoir operators interact with each other through time also changes in farmers water requirements are affected by reservoir release as changes in the release of water from the reservoir impact user behavior reciprocal interaction between stakeholders makes it possible to decide for the future of the water system more accurately and to develop long term planning more exact to prevent system failures against water stress in this inquiry it has been well demonstrated that considering changes in the downstream in addition to a 50 reduction in total water stress over the entire 40 years of operation farmers will benefit more however farmers water consumption was reduced farmers gained 20 more profit in comparison to ignoring farmers behavioral changes for a total of 40 years the profitability of the abm sop scenario is greater than others because it is more flexible and adaptable to the variation of hydrological conditions and also utilizes a higher level of information sharing between agents in abm sop it is observe that high rate of risk taking in addition to more irrigation efficiency caused greater violation from available water due to an additive effect of farmers misevaluation according to eq 8 however low risk taker farmers have benefited from a change in the cropping pattern as discussed earlier the risk in agriculture is neither helpful nor unhelpful but it depends on the farmers characteristics and the experienced situations in this study observed by abm sop kahan 2008 it should be noted that while maximizing farmers profit is not in line with the objectives of this research even so it can be seen that farmers have made more profits in the system by applying changes in downstream since the proposed framework benefits from the self organization of complex human natural systems farmers have been able to adapt and organize themselves to changes and other components of the system and benefited more liu 2008 mitchell 2009 wolfram 1983 since the complex human natural system proposed in this research benefits from self organizing ability exploitative behavior of the agents doesn t limit the long term profitability of the system smith 2008 it is shown that the main reason for improved system profitability is information sharing between farmers and reservoir operators which leads more accurate and reasonable decisions of the farmers in conclusion sharing information between beneficiaries is a key factor for self organization of complex human natural systems such as water resources systems the policy makers should try to increase the level of information sharing between involved parties in order to increase not only system profitability but also the efficiency of their policies although humans are selfish in nature aggregation of humans behavior in complex environmental systems can improve the profitability of the system through a high enough level of information sharing between agents 3 summary and conclusion this study integrates an abm framework with sop to incorporate farmers behavior into reservoir operation problem demand for agricultural water is dynamically generated as farmers adapt to new technology and change cropping pattern farmers are assumed to be cognitive autonomous and unique agents with historical memories interacting dynamically with reservoir operators through reporting their water demand farmers behavior toward changing cropping pattern and adaptation to new irrigation technology was simulated using abm framework leading to dynamic demand over the simulation period the proposed framework and methodology were successfully applied to a large reservoir with 350 000 ha of land it was shown that the system s performance including mean annual deficit and annual profit could be improved significantly if dynamic demand was taken into consideration such achievement is not achieved by forcing farmers to act as ordered by operators farmers are assumed free and act based on their socioeconomic and physiological based characteristics both farmers and reservoir operators assumed to have an exploitative approach in their decision making process however since the complex human natural systems could enjoy from self organizing ability by information sharing both agent groups farmers and reservoir operators could benefit from their selfish decisions the risk aversion level of the farmers revealed that risk taking in agriculture may not always be beneficial and may show different consequences depending on the individual features of farmers over the time span application of diffusion of innovation revealed that it may successfully be used because of some farmers willingness to adapt the new irrigation technology it was shown that adapting new irrigation technology without in farm irrigation management and adapting new cropping pattern may impose capital cost and mortgage which may not even be compensated with the additional profit from water saving this approach may be regarded as the early steps with limitations and shortcomings toward full consideration of farmers social behavior in reservoir operation and management details on farm level in efficiency of different irrigation technologies crop water demand with multiple growth stages diversity of plants and innovations and other agricultural innovation such as local friendly plants fertilizer and pesticides can be investigated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9815,agricultural water demand may dynamically vary as socioeconomic characteristics of farmers evolve reservoir operation under dynamic demand has a quite new origin this paper employs an agent based model abm in combination with the standard reservoir operating policy sop proposed framework abm sop simulates a dynamic long term reservoir operation considering the variations of agricultural water demand as socioeconomic behaviors of farmers evolves in the proposed abm farmers are assumed to have memory and individual characteristics that make exclusive decisions based on their knowledge about the prevailing conditions farmers water demand varies dynamically with their main socioeconomic characteristics addressed by their age education risk taking ability and dependency on agricultural income farmers respond to amount of available water by changing the cropping pattern and irrigation technology without any obligation from policymakers results of this study indicate that first through the dynamic interaction between farmers and reservoir operators water stress experienced by farmers is reduced by about 50 they gain 20 more profit by making adapted decisions under different circumstances second the most critical factor influencing the farmers responses is risk taking rate that might be managed to increase flexibility of farmers in their decisions third a bottom up approach applied in this research shows that selfish farmers could be smart enough to make proper decisions in response to fluctuation in available water as a result of self organizing ability i e ability of individual agents to organize their collective behaviors through interacting with each other rather than external intervention or education of complex human natural systems farmers would balance their risk taking status based on their education and as they receive information on reservoir storage and water availability for allocation so policymakers can improve the efficiency of their decisions by promoting the information exchange with all stakeholders and parties involved in the system operation keywords dynamic demand reservoir operation agent based modeling abm agricultural water supply diffusion of innovation self organization 1 introduction agriculture is one of the significant and most susceptible parts in the face of water scarcity and or availability fao and a o of the u n 2016 giuliani et al 2016 farmers must adapt themselves to the threat of water scarcity to attain food security and prevent corps destruction aghaie et al 2020 turral et al 2011 understanding farmers behavior in irrigated agriculture may help to reduce existing tensions on water resources increase sustainability and adaptability to climate change buelow and cradock henry 2018 feola et al 2015 pouladi et al 2020 2019 agriculture is a social cultural endeavor and farmers may behave differently depending on their financial status age agricultural knowledge adaptability to changes and size of their farm land vanclay 2004 it has been argued that in any reservoir operation for irrigation farmers heterogeneity should be considered as farmers with the same farmland acreage on the same type of climate and water availability can decide differently on their rate of withdraw and application noel and cai 2017 all farmers may not equally seek to maximize their profits in the same sense and their perceptions may affect their final decisions giuliani et al 2016 each farmer based on his her characteristic develops a perception of the existing condition and changes his her behavior based on such understanding and attributes arunrat et al 2017 complex human natural systems are under threat of destruction as a result of exploitative users however according to adam smith selfish agents could improve the social benefit of complex systems by changing this threat to an opportunity smith 2008 in other words complex systems in relation to humans are self organized which means that individual agents can organize their collective behaviors through reproducing the socioeconomic community increasing communication and information sharing between involved parties rather than external intervention or education krugman 1996 luhmann 1995 von hayek 1978 agent based modeling abm is a practical method for simulating complex systems with socioeconomic status mitchell 2009 they are characterized by autonomous adaptable and heterogeneous agents having the ability to adapt to changing conditions each autonomous agent tries to achieve its own goals by changing their behavior based on current conditions as well as the behavior of other agents i e farmers and the environment in abms although the aggregation of agents behaviors is simple the results are rarely predictable castilla rho 2017 mashhadi ali et al 2017 railsback and grimm 2019 although abm in socioeconomic environmental systems suffer from lack of validation and difficulties in formulation of agents behaviors berglund 2015 edwards et al 2005 yang et al 2009 researches conducted in abm gain a lot of achievements in modeling of complex human natural systems noel and cai 2017 abms has been used successfully as a complex system simulator in science and engineering matthews et al 2007 mustafa et al 2017 in agricultural water management some researches are carried out on integrating farmers with different water resources in the field of groundwater management different subjects such as cooperative and non cooperative behavior of farmers optimal crop pattern effects of farmers educations penalties incentives and policy makers limitations have been examined farhadi et al 2016 noel and cai 2017 also irrigation strategies and water sensitivity of farmers in the face of water shortage have been evaluated in the management of river basins du et al 2017 pérez et al 2016 in the management of integrated water basins importance of cooperative behavior of farmers and evaluating the sequential water stress have been discussed akhbari and grigg 2015 van oel et al 2010 reservoir operation strategies to reduce floods and agricultural water stress have been evaluated through changing crop pattern giuliani et al 2016 in most of these researches however farmers are directly or indirectly controlled by the policy makers an assumption which is not materialized in practice assumptions made in these papers on the farmers behaviors for example being cooperative having the ability to choose optimal crop pattern getting education having the ability to improve irrigation strategies and technologies are assumed a priori to be dictated by policy makers however each farmer is an autonomous human agent and wise in his her point of view and different from others also can behave different from those assumed by the researchers of the field railsback and grimm 2019 successful modeling of human natural system should consider socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers and assess its outcome in the form of threats or opportunities this paper introduces an agent based framework with the aim of operating a reservoir for irrigated agriculture with dynamic demand resulting from the farmers socioeconomic characteristics the proposed methodology benefits from farmers heterogeneity in age income education level risk taking and memory retrieval and updating socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers used here are taken from psychological studies on agricultural systems cancian 1967 jianakoplos and bernasek 2006 kahan 2008 knight et al 2003 spicka 2020 in this research farmers decide plan and act upon their own socioeconomic characteristics toward maximizing their objectives whereas most previous studies with abms try to control farmers behavior in the direction of project goals the proposed framework shows that self organizing ability of complex systems in a human based agricultural environment including a reservoir to provide water this model ends up with voluntarily and dynamically changing demand in contrast to common methods of reservoir operation where demand is either constant or pre specified in the planning horizon reservoir operation is carried out using the standard operating policy sop method as the agent based model evolves in this framework farmers change their crop pattern cropland area and crop type and irrigation technology in the face of the available water to each agent reservoir is re operated and new release is scheduled based on the perspective demand resulting from the farmers behavioral changes dynamic and mutual interactions between farmers and reservoir manager provides a more realistic scenario for operating the reservoir considering both the technical and socioeconomic issues the aggregation of both exploitative groups i e farmers and policy makers behaviors is examined in this research to show the self organizing ability of human agricultural systems performance of the proposed model is tested using hydrologic data from dez reservoir in iran data on farmers heterogeneity is not specific to the local area and are partially borrowed from other researchers pouladi et al 2020 2019 2 materials and approaches this research intends to present a novel reservoir operation model for agricultural irrigation considering the socioeconomic behavior of the farmers in this paper unique and autonomous agents are applied to show the self organizing ability of a complex human natural system where the agents are not obliged to obey policy makers orders and try to exploit the resources two main groups of agents farmers and reservoir operators are applied to this model more details in 2 1 section farmers and reservoir operators as main agents in this research decide upon their personal interests interact with each other and share information following their own benefit the abm technique is employed for modeling farmers behavior and standard operating policy sop is used to operate the reservoir while the demand is updating the reservoir water demand is dynamically refined based on farmers heterogeneity addressed by their socioeconomic statuses farmers also react to the available water through changing crop patterns and irrigation technology assumed as an innovation in the farmers community using rogers diffusion of innovation theory rogers 1995 in this research farmers income dependency on agriculture and their ages are used for determining their risk taking degree according to fao and psychological studies on agricultural risk cancian 1967 jianakoplos and bernasek 2006 kahan 2008 knight et al 2003 spicka 2020 which also applied in previous researches this risk taking factor influences the farmers perception of the amount of water available to them along with their education level as parameters for introducing agents heterogeneity in this model farmers have memory and their past actions have an impact on their decisions farmers may also affect the behavior of their neighbors in changing their agricultural system in response to available water autonomous farmers may change their crop pattern i e the type of crop and the cropping area of each harvest and the irrigation technology willingly instead of imperatively 2 1 agent based model the agents in this research are signified by farmers reservoir operators and government agency each agent tries to behave according to their goals these agents interact with one another and their counterpart s behavior influences the rest the conceptual relationship between these agents is illustrated in fig 1 the government agency is a simple agent and just provides loans to farmers detailed characteristics of farmers and reservoir operators are discussed in sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 respectively 2 1 1 farmers features and decisions 2 1 1 1 farmers heterogeneous features as shown in table 1 farmers are differentiated from each other by age range from 20 to 90 years income dependence on agriculture range from 0 to 100 and the level of education high or low educated affecting farmers decisions balbi et al 2013 ghazali et al 2018 schreinemachers and berger 2011 in order to simplify the model three characteristics are assumed fixed during the time farmers age and income dependency on agriculture are used for determining their risk taking level according to fao and psychological studies on agricultural risk cancian 1967 jianakoplos and bernasek 2006 kahan 2008 knight et al 2003 spicka 2020 this risk factor influences the farmers perception of the amount of water available to them accordingly young farmers with lower income dependency on agriculture are more risk taker than others balbi et al 2013 here a farmer aged 20 with zero percent income dependency on agriculture is considered as the agent with the highest risk taker rating of one a farmer aged 90 with 100 income dependency on agriculture is identified as a risk averse farmer with risk rating of zero the rest of the farmers are rated using two dimensional linear interpolation eq 1 1 α i y f incdep i y age i y 90 age i y 2 100 incdep i y 2 90 20 2 100 0 2 in eq 1 α age and incdep are risk taking level farmer s age and percentage of farmer s income dependency on agriculture respectively the superscript y represents the time year subscripts i represents farmer s number in the model for example the risk taking level of a farmer agent 12 in each year y is a function of farmer s age age 31 as well as farmer s income dependency on agriculture incdep 13 and is equal to 0 86 α which can be seen in the grey cell in table 1 proposed farmers have memory and their past actions have an impact on their decisions as well as their socioeconomic features farmers may also affect the behavior of their neighbors in changing their agricultural system in response to available water autonomous farmers may change their annual crop pattern i e type and cultivated area of each crop and the irrigation technology through the proposed decision making process willingly without any obligation to test the performance of the proposed modeling scheme an agricultural district with 350 000 ha of irrigated agriculture is assumed the farmers are classified into 20 groups as cognitive agents as illustrated in table 1 farmers decide on their future status based on the existing condition and according to their characteristics as addressed in fig 1 to feed the model with the farmers historical memory the first 5 years is treated as initial condition with the traditional and locally dominant cropping patterns and irrigation technology figs 2 3 from 6th year onwards the abm is used to refine the farmers demand and associated reservoir release by the operator 2 1 1 2 farmers decisions for order to simplification this study restricts the farmers behavioral options to change in cropping pattern and irrigation technology only farmers are assumed to change their cropping pattern and enhance their irrigation technology according to their social characteristics as discussed in the following sections 2 1 1 2 1 process of changing the cropping pattern this study considers cucumber watermelon maize and beans as commonly cultivated crops in the area growing seasons and associated water requirement for each potential crop is presented in table 2 the study assumes that the total of 17 500 ha which is available land area for each farmer is equally allocated to the four potential crops for the first five years i e 4 crop combination with 0 non cropping as presented in fig 2a therefore initially 4375 ha is allocated to each crop including cucumber watermelon maize and beans for each farmer to create historical memory necessary for them to decide on the future farmers are considered as cognitive agents that behave based on analyzing the available data and information to maximize their profits farmers make their initial decisions based on the amount of available water as expected each year more importantly these decisions are based on farmers characteristics and their perspectives on maximizing profits which may vary from one farmer to another each farmer may show rational behavior from their own points of view arunrat et al 2017 noel and cai 2017 schreinemachers and berger 2011 as mentioned before farmers are not obliged to improve their crop pattern in order to reduce water stress they are free in their decision making process and can be consumerist or water saver each farmer decides on the cropping pattern based on their memory affected their loss of profits and required water flow of information for selecting cropping pattern by a farmer is presented in fig 2 according to edwards et al 2005 the degree of economic and practical superiority of the individual farmer s decision compared to the group decision over the short term and long term decision history is calculated by binary parameters p1 p2 p3 and p4 eqs 2 5 as defined in eqs 2 3 p1 and p2 show how each individual farmer values their short term and long term decisions economically in comparison with their neighbors respectively for instance if each farmer gain more profit than his her neighbors in the last five year s p1 p2 is equal to 1 otherwise is zero according to eqs 4 5 p3 p4 indicates how each all farmer s assesses the accuracy of their short term estimation about their available water in comparison with their long term estimations for instance if the ratio between requested water and available water for each all farmer s is lower than this ratio in last 5 years p3 p4 is equal to 1 otherwise is equal to zero 2 p 1 i y sign max 0 p r o f i t i y 1 i 1 n f p r o f i t i y 1 n f y y 5 3 p 2 i y sign max 0 y y 5 y 1 profit i y y y 5 y 1 i 1 nf profit i y nf y y 5 4 p 3 i y sign

farmer has four patch of lands each 4375 ha and will only allocate one crop to each patch at a time under this assumption there are 23 potential crop combinations for land allocation as presented in fig 2a for the agents at the beginning farmers are to choose five crop combinations fig 2a in a way that their water demand is close to the farmer s expected available water farmerexp then farmers scrutinize five types of non cropping including 0 25 50 75 or 100 strategies in order to determine the cultivated area for each of the selected crops patterns in previous stage now farmers are faced with 25 options to select the most cost effective option based on their expected available water farmerexp by the end of this stage the type and the area of cultivation under each crop is calculated for each farmer 2 1 1 2 2 process of changing the irrigation technology at this stage the idea of changing to a more advanced irrigation technology is considered this enhancement in irrigation technology is considered as an innovation to the agents this innovation is evaluated based on roger s diffusion of innovations book one of the most prestigious theories in this field according to roger s the development of an innovation in a community is a multi stage process it includes knowledge acquisition for innovation personal perception of innovation decision making implementation and confirmation as stated by rogers 1995 it is a process that takes us from the basic knowledge of innovation to the road either to adapt or reject it and acts as an uncertainty reduction process in this research a simplified version of the rogers diffusion of innovation is implemented in line with the nature of the problem a proposed detailed flowchart of this process is presented in fig 3 as presented in fig 3 initially all farmers are following the traditional irrigation technology for the first five years however from the sixth year forward they are free to act upon their own decisions to adapt and implement the new irrigation technology related to psychological based socioeconomic features of farmers in this research it is assumed that the farmers may change to an advanced irrigation technology such as underground irrigation technique the traditional irrigation system and the new proposed one are assumed to have the same operational and maintenance cost and only the new technology requires an initial capital cost the irrigation efficiency of the primary and the new irrigation technology are assumed to be 0 6 and 0 8 respectively the diffusion of innovation is a multi step and threshold based process according to fig 3 the first step is referred to as knowledge in the diffusion of the innovation process this stage examines the situation under which farmers seek knowledge to reduce their water stress when the relative annual water stress exerted to farmers exceeds the threshold for their tolerance according to table a in fig 3 the knowledge stage is activated to reduce the water stress in the second step named persuasion farmers psychological and emotional perception of innovation is examined in terms of relative advantages compatibility and complexity of the new irrigation technology according to various agricultural psychological studies farmers who are more risk taker more educated and richer are persuaded more easily to take on new irrigation technology jianakoplos and bernasek 2006 kahan et al 2008 rogers 1995 according to table b in fig 3 each farmer receives a positive negative or neutral value regarding their perception about the new irrigation technology that represent their attitude towards innovation in the third step referred to the decision making phase the only farmer s self opinion i e persuasion in step 2 affects farmer s decision the fourth step is the implementation phase that examines the financial constraints as another controlling factor in the process of adaptation to innovation farmers may decide to choose new irrigation technology unless they do not have the required financial ability to do so since the irrigation technology can be bought through loan farmers option is not limited by their available cash the final step is confirmation in which farmers who have been able to reduce their water stress by using of new irrigation technology would suggest it to their neighbors however for simplification purposes it i assumed here that farmer s neighbors don t have any effect on farmer s decision making process and farmers decide solely based on their assessment it should be noted that this research uses a simplified model of rogers diffusion of innovation methodology which could be different for other cases 2 1 1 2 3 rate of revenue cost and profit based on the availability of water eqs 11 and

a suitable arrangement for the operation of the reservoir this agent is cognitive and it deals with the analysis of data and information this study employs the standard operation policy sop for reservoir operation for the long term operation of the reservoir a 40 year historical inflow to the reservoir is used reservoir s primary storage is assumed as 1430 mcm non agricultural monthly water demand is 191 7 mcm the maximum and minimum reservoir storage is equal to 3340 mcm and 830 mcm respectively 2 2 linking the farmers simulation model to the reservoir operating model the process of reservoir operation in response to farmers decisions is shown in the flowchart of fig 4 an abm is linked to a sop based reservoir operation during a 40 year simulation period referred to as abm sop to evaluate the performance of the proposed model abm sop the reservoir is operated by a traditional sop based model referred to as only sop and the results are presented and compared in the results section in only sop farmers water demand is assumed to be constant over the entire simulation period as common practice in abm sop however the effects of changing the cropping pattern and irrigation technology on water demand are applied simultaneously 3 results 3 1 comparison on a general scale temporal variation of agricultural demand over the 40 years of simulation with historical inflow is presented in fig 5 it shows the demand variation under 2 different scenario as identified earlier as only sop and abm sop to create farmers memory the water demand is kept constant at 5505 mcm in the first five years for all scenarios as addressed earlier the water requirement in the only sop is constant and does not correlate with the reservoir yield for instance total annual demand agriculture and non agriculture in this scenario is constant for each year equal to 5505 mcm in the abm sop annual demand has simultaneously been affected by possible variations in cropping pattern and adapting new irrigation technology abm sop is created through aggregating of changing crop pattern and irrigation technology to show how simultaneous overlap of simple behavior of farmers could affect this complex system in this case farmers have achieved more adaptation with the conditions and have been able to enhance their consumption patterns for instance the annual demand reaches to 4677 mcm in 27th year as a dry year and 5308 mcm in 30th year as wet year these examples show that the abm sop model is more flexible as mentioned before 27th year is dry and farmers should decrease their demand and 30th year is a wet one and farmers could increase their demand in both cases the abm sop achieves better result this indicates that aggregated scenario abm sop could reduce water demand and is also more flexible as mentioned before the cooperative behavior or consensus of the farmers are not forced in abm scenario and all agents behave exploitatively however according to smith 2008 aggregation of selfish behavior of agents in a complex human system could eventually benefit the system which is not the primary aim of the agents there is an inverse relation between the annual shortage volume and annual release from the reservoir as shown in fig 6 although the reservoir is designed for inter and intra annual regulation of inflowing water water shortage deficit mostly occur in dry years with low inflow to the reservoir as more enhanced scenario abm sop is adapted the overall volumes of shortage are reduced it can be seen on the results of abm sop that water shortages are much smaller for most years and that farmers bear less water stress compared to only sop in sum under abm sop farmers experience less water stress because of simultaneous adaptation to crop patterns and irrigation technologies while the pair of average annual water deficit and standard deviation in only sop is equal to 413 607 mcm it decreases to 190 330 mcm in abm sop it is obvious that as the flexibility of the model increases the volume of water deficit decreases besides in 27th year as a dry year adaptation of only sop results in significantly high deficit of 1577 mcm which far exceeds of abm sop and 27th year water deficit is reduced by 54 in abm sop 732 mcm water deficit is related to farmers decisions on crop pattern and irrigation technology so the more proper decisions farmers make the less water shortage they face due to higher level of flexibility of abm sop farmers decisions follows the inflow fluctuation more closely according to proposed model farmers will not only reduce their water consumption but also seek more profit in an exploitative manner surprisingly farmers profit seeking behavior leads to rational behaviors and reduce water deficit this emphasizes on the fact that exploitative behavior of agents is not a barrier in complex human natural systems and could benefit stakeholders through agents interactions time variation of the farmers annual profits from agriculture is presented in fig 7 as illustrated the annual variation in profit closely follows that of available water that may be attributed to the release form the reservoir and the farmers decision on managing their available water through adapting to different strategies fig 7 shows that the average annual profit for the two scenarios ranges from 2303 m to 2751 m for only sop and abm sop respectively accordingly the standard deviation of the annual profit ranges from 307 m to 423 m for only sop and abm sop respectively these statistical parameters show that the abm sop has greater profit in terms of not only the annual average but also the standard deviation according to what stated about water deficit in abm sop farmers are more flexible to adapt with different reservoir fluctuations indeed farmers water deficit in only sop is greater than abm sop as a result of farmers best adaptation so the profitability of farmers decision increase in abm sop it is observed that for almost entire simulation period of 40 years the annual profit for the only sop falls below other scenario fig 7 indicates the importance of considering the agents social behavior in agricultural water management and reservoir operations more specifically implementation of the abm sop leads to a significant increase in annual profit mostly due to its ability to adapt to the fluctuation in available water agents exploitative and profit seeking behavior is exploited by the model caused to both reduce water deficit and increase system profitability table 3 shows how diffusion of innovation evolves during the 40 years of simulation in abm sop the model is introduced according to different stages of rogers innovation theory and the results are consistent with previous research conducted in this study it is assumed that the agents may benefit from governmental loan to pay for the capital cost of implementing the new technology therefore the farmers features have a more significant role than financial status in the adaptation process according to table 3 high risk taking farmers with higher levels of education as innovators are more responsive to water deficit and more possibly adapt to new irrigation technology in this study the farmers 10 12 18 as young highly educated and risk taker farmers with low income dependency on agriculture are known as innovators and adapted to new irrigation technology in 7th year the next adaptation accrued in the 17th year by farmer 7 with a high rate of risk taking the remaining farmers do not adapt the new technology in their decision making process it means the lack the characteristics required for the proposed adaptation process in this research it should be noted that this research introduced a simplified model according to rogers diffusion of innovation methodology and this model could be different for other cases to sum up this section some informative and comparative results on only sop and abm sop are presented in table 4 it shows that under abm sop scenario farmers are using almost 9 2 less water compared to the business as usual only sop scenario the average annual water use is decreased by 510 mcm from 5505 to 4995 mcm although the total water use has considerably reduced the average annual profit from irrigated agriculture has increased by almost 20 from 2303 to 2751 m this is a very significant enhancement in water use efficiency and agricultural return all is happening without major change in cultivated land and no profit loss to agricultural sector as observed the average cultivated land is reduced by approximately 2 6 which accounts for 10 thousand hectares results presented in table 4 reveals that under abm sop scenario farmers have been able to cultivate less cropland and experience about 50 less shortage than the only sop condition farmers are reducing their water demand while they are gaining more profit by increasing flexibility in decision making due to enhancing irrigation efficiency and changing crop pattern based on experienced situations in abm sop there is not any top down rules to oblige farmers for decreasing water shortage or increasing system profitability and farmers have been tried to be modeled in a way that is realistic and based on their characteristics however it is seen that farmers change their behavior voluntarily and not coercive which can achieve a total profit level of about 20 this achievement is a result of the self organizing ability of human natural systems that can turn the threat of exploitative behavior of agents into an opportunity of more profitability and less water stress liu 2008 mitchell 2009 wolfram 1983 this research benefit from information sharing between farmers and reservoir operators leading to a comprehensive interaction between beneficiaries farmers in this study are not obliged to reduce their water consumption or water stress as ordered by the operators they are assumed free to make decisions willingly based on their own rational point of view which maybe irrational from others point of view 3 2 comparison on individual scale in this research farmers have not all behaved in the same way and they have not acted in the same common sense practically instead farmers have changed their behavior based on their characteristics and the rationale of the behavior is different from the perspective of each farmer and each person does something right from his her own point of view although it is not rational from the perspective of the operators and other farmers fig 8 is used to show the impact of the individual farmers behavior on their corresponding profits fig 8 shows the role of farmer s risk taking rate in their average annual profit in abm sop farmers overcome the water deficit in both changing crop pattern and irrigation technology although all farmers make decisions to increase their benefit not all are successful as others farmers with a low to medium risk taking rate 0 0 75 benefit more than farmers with a higher rate of risk taking 0 75 1 farmers with a high rate of risk taking would not benefit enough by improving the irrigation efficiency compared with low to medium risk taker farmers while risk taker farmers tend to use new irrigation technology the improvement made in irrigation efficiency leads to an additive effect on their misevaluation about their available water as shown in eq 8 this research shows numerically that risk taking in agricultural systems is not always beneficial as reported by fao kahan 2008 as mentioned before in abm sop farmers with a low and medium rate of risk taking are the most successful to gain profit by desirable violation from average available water in summary adopting new irrigation technology without in farm irrigation management and adapting new cropping patterns may impose capital cost and mortgage which may not even be compensated with the additional profit from water saving 4 discussion this study aimed to achieve a more realistic model to simulate socioeconomic farmers behavior for determining the reservoir release for agricultural applications in this research a new approach to reservoir operation was presented which can adapt to changes in the dynamic farmers water demand dynamic and mutual combining a sop and an abm is employed to determine the users variable water demand over a 40 year period the strength of this research in comparison with previous related studies is that farmers and reservoir operators are selfish and exploitative agents try to benefit from the progressive situation farmers in this model are not completely wise they act upon their psychological based socioeconomic features farmers decision making process aims to maximize their profit according to their perception of the situation and also none of them didn t care about other agents on the other hand reservoir operators just try to release water concerning reported demand by farmers these two group of agents i e farmers and reservoir operators interact with each other through time also changes in farmers water requirements are affected by reservoir release as changes in the release of water from the reservoir impact user behavior reciprocal interaction between stakeholders makes it possible to decide for the future of the water system more accurately and to develop long term planning more exact to prevent system failures against water stress in this inquiry it has been well demonstrated that considering changes in the downstream in addition to a 50 reduction in total water stress over the entire 40 years of operation farmers will benefit more however farmers water consumption was reduced farmers gained 20 more profit in comparison to ignoring farmers behavioral changes for a total of 40 years the profitability of the abm sop scenario is greater than others because it is more flexible and adaptable to the variation of hydrological conditions and also utilizes a higher level of information sharing between agents in abm sop it is observe that high rate of risk taking in addition to more irrigation efficiency caused greater violation from available water due to an additive effect of farmers misevaluation according to eq 8 however low risk taker farmers have benefited from a change in the cropping pattern as discussed earlier the risk in agriculture is neither helpful nor unhelpful but it depends on the farmers characteristics and the experienced situations in this study observed by abm sop kahan 2008 it should be noted that while maximizing farmers profit is not in line with the objectives of this research even so it can be seen that farmers have made more profits in the system by applying changes in downstream since the proposed framework benefits from the self organization of complex human natural systems farmers have been able to adapt and organize themselves to changes and other components of the system and benefited more liu 2008 mitchell 2009 wolfram 1983 since the complex human natural system proposed in this research benefits from self organizing ability exploitative behavior of the agents doesn t limit the long term profitability of the system smith 2008 it is shown that the main reason for improved system profitability is information sharing between farmers and reservoir operators which leads more accurate and reasonable decisions of the farmers in conclusion sharing information between beneficiaries is a key factor for self organization of complex human natural systems such as water resources systems the policy makers should try to increase the level of information sharing between involved parties in order to increase not only system profitability but also the efficiency of their policies although humans are selfish in nature aggregation of humans behavior in complex environmental systems can improve the profitability of the system through a high enough level of information sharing between agents 3 summary and conclusion this study integrates an abm framework with sop to incorporate farmers behavior into reservoir operation problem demand for agricultural water is dynamically generated as farmers adapt to new technology and change cropping pattern farmers are assumed to be cognitive autonomous and unique agents with historical memories interacting dynamically with reservoir operators through reporting their water demand farmers behavior toward changing cropping pattern and adaptation to new irrigation technology was simulated using abm framework leading to dynamic demand over the simulation period the proposed framework and methodology were successfully applied to a large reservoir with 350 000 ha of land it was shown that the system s performance including mean annual deficit and annual profit could be improved significantly if dynamic demand was taken into consideration such achievement is not achieved by forcing farmers to act as ordered by operators farmers are assumed free and act based on their socioeconomic and physiological based characteristics both farmers and reservoir operators assumed to have an exploitative approach in their decision making process however since the complex human natural systems could enjoy from self organizing ability by information sharing both agent groups farmers and reservoir operators could benefit from their selfish decisions the risk aversion level of the farmers revealed that risk taking in agriculture may not always be beneficial and may show different consequences depending on the individual features of farmers over the time span application of diffusion of innovation revealed that it may successfully be used because of some farmers willingness to adapt the new irrigation technology it was shown that adapting new irrigation technology without in farm irrigation management and adapting new cropping pattern may impose capital cost and mortgage which may not even be compensated with the additional profit from water saving this approach may be regarded as the early steps with limitations and shortcomings toward full consideration of farmers social behavior in reservoir operation and management details on farm level in efficiency of different irrigation technologies crop water demand with multiple growth stages diversity of plants and innovations and other agricultural innovation such as local friendly plants fertilizer and pesticides can be investigated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9816,due to global warming it is necessary to study the influence of extreme climate and concurrent events on crop growth the study area was the songliao plain where drought events frequently occur first the daily meteorological data of 14 meteorological stations from 1981 to 2016 were collected to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in the crop water surplus and deficit index extreme growing degree days and heat stress intensity during different growth stages of maize second the cloud model was used to describe the fuzziness of concurrent events simultaneous drought and heat and mutual mapping between qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken the fuzzy certainty degree of the influence of different degrees of concurrent events on maize was calculated third the copula function was used to describe the randomness of concurrent extreme events and calculate the joint probability distribution and return period an assessment method was proposed for concurrent events from the perspective of system uncertainty finally we analyzed the relationship between concurrent events and maize yield which showed different degrees of water deficit and warming trends during each growth period crops were most affected by extreme weather during the reproductive growth period rgp during the vegetative growth period vgp the temperature increase was higher than in other periods especially in the high latitude region the frequency of mild concurrent events was higher during the vgp and rgp during the vegetative and reproductive period the average occurrence probability of mild moderate and severe concurrent events was 21 9 1 7 and 0 35 respectively whereas during the rgp it was 23 1 8 2 and 0 12 respectively the present study provides a meaningful reference for a better understanding of the occurrence laws of drought heat and concurrent events during crop growth periods and how to optimize the agricultural management of maize keywords concurrent events high temperature climate change fuzziness randomness 1 introduction in the past century the earth has experienced significant global warming lobell et al 2011 ray et al 2019 wang and chen 2014 after a record heat event in 2015 the world meteorological organization told the international community that it would need to cope with a hotter drier and wetter future church et al 2013 agriculture is particularly sensitive to climate change climatic factors such as temperature precipitation radiation and wind speed affect the physiological development and yield of crops and abnormal changes cause various agricultural disasters chen et al 2016 killi et al 2017 miliauskienė et al 2016 due to increasing global food demand the temporal and spatial variation law of extreme weather and climate and the occurrence law of concurrent agrometeorological disaster events must be identified the present study will aid in making strategic decisions on food security and implementing policies technologies and strategies to adapt agriculture to climate change drought is a natural agricultural disaster with a wide range high frequency and long duration that threatens national food security mahrookashani et al 2017 climate change has led to an increase in the severity and duration of drought events in many areas of china often accompanied by heat and heat waves chen and sun 2017 miao et al 2016 sun et al 2014 heat and drought are two related but different constraints although heat may not cause drought it is likely to aggravate the degree of drought the occurrence of drought is complex and lagging whereas that of heat is short term and sudden combining these two natural disasters will have a far reaching effect on food security by shortening the crop growth period and reducing the crop production potential zandalinas et al 2018 for example in 2014 drought and a heat wave in california triggered wildfires and caused an agricultural water crisis aghakouchak et al 2014 in 2016 there was historic heat and drought in southeast asia qian et al 2019 research on the hazards and risks of the coexistence of various extreme meteorological events or agricultural disasters is limited leonard et al 2014 several studies have analyzed the challenges of the multi hazard framework aghakouchak et al 2014 mesbahzadeh et al 2020 wang et al 2019 sharma and mujumdar 2017 the combined stress of heat and drought severely affects wheat yield compared to a single stress factor mahrookashani et al 2017 matiu et al 2017 observed that maize yield decreased by 11 6 under dry and hot conditions but only by 7 8 under dry conditions using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and temperature data lobell et al 2015 reported that the effect of heat events is increasing and heat factors should be considered when carrying out drought risk management thus the traditional univariate risk assessment method based on precipitation conditions may significantly underestimate the risk of extreme events because it ignores the influence of temperature fang et al 2019 wang et al 2018a evaluated the risk of drought and heat events during the growth period of summer maize in the huang huai hai plain using spei during critical growth periods combined with the cumulative distribution function and climate trend rate miao et al 2016 comprehensively analyzed the joint probabilistic characteristics and tendencies for bivariate and trivariate precipitation and temperature indices based on the copula theory from previous studies the relationship between meteorological factors and crop yield has been established based on deterministic methods or via model simulation and weight calculation using climatic factors these ignore the uncertainty of the crop itself and the research system research on randomness and fuzziness of uncertain systems has advanced chen et al 2012 wu et al 2019 however few studies have combined the uncertainty study with a study of multiple extreme events in the field of meteorological disasters there are limited studies on the probability calculation of various extreme events therefore it is essential to understand the temporal and spatial variation law of crop water requirement etc effective rainfall pei and extreme heat heat stress intensity his and extreme growing degree days edd during a maize growth period and the occurrence of concurrent events of drought and heat in each period the primary purpose of the present study was to describe the randomness and fuzziness of drought and heat events on maize crops the maize producing area of the songliao plain was chosen as the study area we combined the cloud and copula models to analyze two natural disasters together and answered the following questions based on uncertainty a how do precipitation and extreme heat change during the different growth stages of maize b what is the condition of concurrent drought heat events in different degrees for maize in the study area c how are the joint distribution probability and co occurrence recurrence periods of compound stress distributed the present study provided a meaningful reference for a better understanding of the occurrence laws of drought heat and concurrent events during the crop growth period and the results can aid in protecting fragile agro ecosystems which is of great significance for further study on hazard quantification and risk assessment of various agricultural disasters and the rational allocation of water and heat resources to ensure food security 2 study area and data sources 2 1

precondition cloud generator algorithm representing uncertain phenomena has always been the focus of natural science research among the uncertainties randomness and fuzziness are the most critical chengguo et al 2018 mingyuan et al 2016 zheng jie et al 2014 the cloud model uses three numerical characterizations of expectation ex entropy en and super entropy he to associate fuzziness and randomness to form a map between qualitative and quantitative data dey and changyu 2004 ex is the point in the universe space that can best represent the qualitative concept c en reflects the uncertainty of qualitative concept c and the range of the number domain that can be accepted by the linguistic value in the number domain namely ambiguity he is the dispersion degree of entropy namely the entropy of entropy and reflects the cohesion of each numerical value representing the linguistic value certainty and the condensation degree of cloud droplets fig 2 after constructing the evaluation cloud he was determined by experience based on the uncertainty and randomness of specific indicators and subjective factors were strong which weakened the randomness of the cloud model therefore when building the composite disaster assessment cloud based on the principle of assessment grade division we used the reverse cloud generator to determine the he value in the assessment cloud making the assessment cloud more objective tursken 2006 simultaneously the multi attribute evaluation method was used to calculate the influence grade of drought and heat on maize growth and

constructed by marginal distribution and correlation structure to describe the dependence among variables its theory can be expressed as follows let x and y be continuous random variables and their marginal distribution functions are fx x and fy y respectively and the joint distribution function is f x y salvadori and de michele 2004 2010 if each marginal distribution function is continuous there is a unique copula function c u v which makes 15 f x y c f x x f y y c u v where f x y is the joint distribution function c represents the copula function u is the marginal distribution function of random variable x and v is the marginal distribution function of random variable y to construct the copula we first measured the correlation between elements and then determined the marginal distribution function of variables and finally fitted and tested the copula in the present study the spearman coefficient was used to measure the correlation of the variables to be extracted for the marginal fitting 17 common distribution functions were selected table si 1 markov chain monte carlo simulation was used to calculate the parameters included in the copula function under the bayesian

year in the cwsdi after 2012 the cwsdi changed from being stable to increasing pei increased after 2012 and broke through the reliability line of 1 98 of the m k mutation test in 2015 exhibiting a distinct upward trend the average value of pei was 134 77 mm in 2011 2016 and 98 95 mm in 2006 2010 the average value of etc in 2011 2016 was 139 43 mm in 1982 and 2004 there were extremely low points with pei 50 mm and cwsdi 75 belonging to extreme drought years during the vrp fig 3b the cwsdi in 1997 2000 2014 and 2015 was lower than 65 the mutation points of cwsdi occurred in 1997 and 2008 before 1997 cwsdi displayed a downward trend additionally the mutations of pei and etc occurred around 1997 in 1996 2000 pei was 83 25 mm and etc was 132 20 mm during 1991 1995 the average pei and etc were 114 84 and 118 17 mm respectively the average pei in 2001 2005 and 2006 2010 were 89 77 and 96 46 mm respectively and the average etc were 126 74 and 121 92 mm after 2008 it showed a significant downward trend again the pei in 2016 was only 68 04 mm during the rgp fig 3c the mutation of cwsdi occurred in 1999 the average values of pei and etc before 1999 were 153 86 and 192 13 mm respectively whereas after 1999 these values were 129 and 196 71 mm respectively the mean value of cwsdi decreased from 0 19 to 0 34 during the wgp fig 3d the overall trend of pei and etc was similar to that in rgp the mutation period occurred around 1992 pei fluctuated significantly and the study area was in water deficit except for the vgp the yield of maize in the study area might be reduced due to insufficient irrigation the annual pei etc and cwsdi of the three growth periods vgp vrp and rgp were calculated and their multi year average values were measured the inverse distance weighting method was used for spatial interpolation and the distribution of water resources in the study area was analyzed fig 4 the ranges of etc pei and cwsdi were 81 222 mm 41 205 mm and 55 1 respectively there were pronounced differences during each growth period in the vgp the etc was 128 175 mm fig 4a1 except for yingkou the pei in most areas was between 68 and 123 mm and the cwsdi changed significantly in the entire region gradually decreasing from the north to south except in harbin and baicheng the cwsdi in most areas ranged from 46 to 28 fig 4c1 in the vgp the water supply was deficient in most years in the vrp the etc in most areas ranged from 100 to 152 mm fig 4a2 however the etc in shuangliao was 199 mm pei was concentrated between 68 and 123 mm fig 4b2 the demand for water by crops began to increase the cwsdi ranged between 28 and 8 and the drought in the entire region was light fig 4c2 in rgp the etc ranged from 175 to 222 mm fig 4a3 and pei showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast fig 4b3 the pei in northwest china was 68 123 mm whereas that in southeast china was 150 205 mm additionally the cwsdi during this period showed an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast fig 4c3 the drought in baicheng da an qianan changling and shuangyang was particularly severe in most years precipitation was insufficient and evaporation was large 4 1 2 temporal and spatial variation of heat the change laws of edd and hsi during each growth period of maize in 35 y were calculated in the present study by simultaneously calculating the average maximum temperature fig 5 the heat stress in the high latitudes north was more severe than that in the low latitudes south during the vgp and vrp fig 5a in the rgp there was a trend of severe heat stress fig 5a3 and baicheng da an and qianguo showed a high temperature trend fig 5b3 although the northern region was generally colder xiaoqing et al 2015 hsi in the northern region was more severe than that in the southern region during the vgp and vrp the growth period was delayed in the northern areas especially the jointing and mature stages fig si 1 the growth period in the northern region was delayed more severely leading to maize being exposed to more heat than other regions in the vgp and vrp the maximum hsi in high latitude areas northwest was above 34 c in the vgp the average edd in northwest china was 7 8 c d which was twice as high as that in the low latitudes southeast fig 5a1 in the vrp the average edd in northwest china was 6 5 c d fig 5a2 in rgp hsi was above 32 fig 5b3 and edd was 18 c d fig 5a3 the spatial variation of the mean value of the heat stress index was small over the last 35 years the high latitude areas northwest in songliao plain have been under severe heat stress during vgp and vrp the maximum value of hsi ranged between 33 5 c and 34 5 c and the maximum value of edd was 38 2 c d in the rgp the heat stress in low latitude areas southeast was severe the maximum value of hsi ranged between 33 0 c and 34 0 c and the maximum value of edd was 75 4 c d during the rgp hsi showed a slight upward trend after 2010 during the vgp hsi showed an apparent upward trend after 1990 and exceeded the reliability line of 1 98 in 2002 2005 2011 and 2014 reaching a significant level during the vrp hsi showed a significant downward trend from 1981 to 1997 fell below the reliability line of 1 98 in 1990 and then showed an increasing trend simultaneously the annual average maximum temperature in the fig 5c2 is similar to the trend of hsi the average temperature is often higher after a sudden change year with this phenomenon requiring further study 4 2 uncertainty analysis of concurrent drought heat events first we corrected the data chose a constant multiplied it by cwsdi called it relative cwsdi and then fitted it to the cloud model positive integer 1 was chosen as constant during 1981 2016 cwsdi 0 55 in the vgp and cwsdi 0 65 in the vrp and when the maximum temperature 33 then drought and extreme heat events occurred together during the rgp and wgp periods cwsdi 0 65 and when the highest temperature 30 drought and extreme heat events occurred together additionally the edd was graded by percentile where n eddmax eddmin for extremely high temperatures of different degrees n was 10 30 and 80 the drought grade standard of the cwsdi of maize was determined based on the drought grade of the water deficit index specified in the drought grade standard of spring maize in north china china meteorological administration 2015 and historical disaster data of typical representative stations in the study area composite events were divided into three levels according to cwsdi and edd levels three cloud characteristic values table 3 and conceptual cloud models fig si 2 of each drought disaster risk grade were obtained from the interval threshold the similarity k of c to c was calculated using the cloud algorithm and the maximum value was retrieved the evaluation result corresponding to the maximum value was the impact degree of the corresponding concurrent events on crops from 1981 to 2016 in the vgp there were five events above level iii in baicheng da an shuangliao and xinmin in the vrp baicheng da an qianan qianguo changtu and xinmin had more than five level ⅲ events and more than 10 level ⅱ events more than 10 level ⅲ events occurred in changling and nong an in the rgp baicheng da an qianan qianguo changling nong an and shuangliao had more than five level ⅲ events the period was divided into three intervals 1981 1992 1993 2004 and 2005 2016 the frequencies of concurrent events in different degrees during the three periods were calculated fig 6 the frequency of level i concurrent events was higher in vgp and rgp level ⅱ events occurred more frequently in vrp harbin shuangliao and benxi were the regions where level i events in the vgp showed an apparent and continuous increasing trend during all three periods in the vgp level i events showed an apparent and continuous decreasing trend in changling whereas in the rgp it was only found in baicheng in the vrp level ii concurrent events showed an apparent and continuous increasing trend in benxi whereas a decreasing trend was seen in qianan changling shuangliao xinmin and shenyang and occurrence probability of level iii events in qianan changling and xinmin continued to increase 4 3 probability analysis of concurrent drought heat events the copula function was used to establish the joint distribution probability and recurrence period which can reflect the risk of joint events to evaluate the occurrence regularity of drought and heat during the growth period of spring maize 4 3 1 construction of marginal distribution function to construct the copula joint distribution function effectively the appropriate marginal distribution function of cwsdi and edd was determined during the vrp and rgp both drought and heat have a high occurrence probability with heat having the most significant impact on maize yield gao et al 2012 therefore the present study performed a bivariate analysis of the vrp and rgp of maize at 14 stations a total of 17 marginal distribution functions were used to fit cwsdi and edd and aic and rmse were selected to determine the optimal marginal distribution function the chi square test was used to estimate the parameters of the marginal distribution function and the kolmogorov smirnov method was used to evaluate the gof all optimal distributions passed the α 0 05 significance test tables si 3 and si 4 gpd gev normal logistic and evd were used in the present study table si 2 before establishing the joint distribution function we used the kendall rank correlation coefficient τ and spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ to test the correlation between cwsdi and edd in vrp the τ values were above 0 2 maximum 0 49 baicheng and the ρ values were above 0 25 maximum 0 69 baicheng the τ value in rgp was above 0 2 except in qianguo the maximum value was 0 44 in songliao ρ values were all above 0 2 the maximum value was 0 53 in baicheng all correlation coefficients passed the significance tests of α 0 01 0 05 and 0 2 indicating that a few sites had a strong correlation most sites had medium intensity correlation and some sites had a weak correlation 4 3 2 probability analysis based on copula function the construction of the copulas function is the premise to further understand the joint probability distribution the method to preprocess the data in the present study was the same as that for the cloud model you et al 2018 table 4 shows the optimal coupling function and its parameters for the vrp and rgp of maize at each station in the study area we used the aic bic nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and rmse to test the gof the gof evaluation of the copula function met the standard therefore the optimal copula functions of rgp were mainly gaussian copula and frank copula whereas vrp was mainly gaussian copula 4 3 3 analysis of joint probability and return period based on copula function based on the copula function at each station the probability of heat and drought conditions and the co occurrence return period were calculated probability and co occurrence return periods are representative of concurrent event risk a shorter co occurrence return period represents a higher risk using these we could describe the risk of concurrent events the degree of certainty of each sample point and the influence level of composite events were calculated using the two dimensional precondition cloud generator algorithm the grouping of the influence degree of concurrent events for maize was consistent with the grouping constructed using the cloud model in the vrp the average occurrence probability of mild ⅰ moderate ⅱ and severe ⅲ concurrent events was 21 9 1 7 and 0 35 respectively fig 7 the conditional probability of moderate drought heat events decreased from the northwest to the southeast and the maximum value appeared around baicheng reaching 50 fig 7a1 there was a 1 4 y periodical oscillation which occurred frequently harbin shuangyang yongji had a long return period of more than three years fig 7b1 the occurrence probability of severe events was small and the presentation range was similar to that of moderate events fig 7a2 the return period in the south and northwest was 5 20 y and the return period of more than 20 y covered an extensive range fig 7b2 the joint occurrence probability of extremely severe events was extremely low with a maximum probability of 1 12 fig 7a3 the return period of concurrent events was longer in most areas of the entire study area and was approximately 30 100 y in only a few surrounding areas fig 7b3 in the rgp the average occurrence probability of ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ concurrent events was 23 1 8 2 and 0 12 respectively and the maximum occurrence probability of moderate concurrent events was 50 7 mainly concentrated in baicheng and da an overall the conditional probability of occurrence of concurrent events showed a downward trend from the west to the east fig 7c1 the co occurrence return period was concentrated in 1 3 y occurring frequently fig 7d1 the joint probability distribution of severe concurrent events was similar to that of moderate disasters however the probability of occurrence in most areas was lower than 16 fig 7c2 the return period of co occurrence increased from the south to the north primarily from 1 to 2 5 y in the south and from 2 to 5 y in the north fig 7d2 the occurrence of extremely severe disasters in the study area was an extremely low probability event fig 7c3 the co occurrence return period in the south was more than 100 y the likelihood of extremely heavy concurrent events was low and the return period in very few areas was approximately 20 50 y fig 7d3 there was a warming trend in the study area however most had small warming ranges from the time trend analysis the probability of concurrent events of various degrees increased from 2011 to 2016 5 discussion previous studies on natural disasters have primarily focused on a single meteorological factor the occurrence of a disaster may be the extreme state of a single variable however it is more likely to be the result of a combination of variables it is necessary to know more about the non stationarity of the climate system and the combination principle of climatic variables to understand the process and principle of complex disasters to recognize quantify and prevent risks climate warming promotes drought formation and aggravates its severity cairns et al 2013 castro nava et al 2014 lipiec et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 found that drought was the most common extreme weather event after 2000 and its influence was expanding adversely affecting the growth and development of maize liu et al 2013b observed that high latitudes in the northern hemisphere were more susceptible to climate change by comparing the research results of many countries and the northern boundary of maize planting in the northeast had extended northward additionally the application of model simulation confirmed that the climate warming in northeast china has reached the level that will affect the growth of maize liu et al 2013a thus it is indisputable that crops are exposed to and affected by heat coumou et al 2013 yin et al 2016b the results in the present study showed that pei distribution in the vgp was increasing during the vrp and rgp etc showed a downward trend whereas the crop water demand increased this trend appeared more frequently after 2000 especially during the rgp stage figs 4 and 5 the pei of maize during different growth stages along the songliao plain showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest with the northwest region expected to face more effects from frequent and severe droughts yin et al 2016a zhang and hu 2018 during the vgp and vrp hsi in the high latitudes was more severe than that in the low latitudes in the rgp edd changed more increasing from south to north fig 6 which was contrary to the trend of pei heat affects rainfall and crop water demand to a certain extent and promotes drought however during other critical growth periods only a few stations showed a significant warming trend with apparent regional differences previous studies have confirmed the temperature increase in northeast china li et al 2020b li and amatus 2020 guo et al 2020 and guna et al 2019 used excess heat factors and spei to analyze climate change in china li et al 2020a analyzed the summer heat and drought in northeast china based on greenhouse emissions their results verified that the frequency of drought and heat would increase further from a future climate model our findings were similar to those of previous studies according to the spatial and temporal law most areas in the study area are in a state of worsening drought and increasing heat events drought events occurred more frequently in 2005 2016 than in 1981 1992 and 1993 2004 the characteristics of 2004 2011 and 2014 included low pei and high temperature this was the same as the typical drought year recorded in the disaster ceremony and disaster record provided by the china meteorological data network additionally wang et al 2018b showed similar results from the similarity of composite events calculated using the cloud model most areas in the study area showed level iii events during these years previous study results have shown a phenomenon of high temperature in northeast china however the negative effect on yield can be eliminated by changing planting boundaries and plant varieties or increasing irrigation zhao et al 2014 siebert et al 2017 moreover extreme temperatures will have varying influences across northeast china liu et al 2012 some researchers support that heating alone cannot have a critical negative effect on the growth of maize chen et al 2011 the present study showed that the occurrence probability of moderate and higher concurrent events in the vrp and the rgp of plants was higher in northwest china which was consistent with the analysis results of the drought heat events occurrence law in the rgp the return period of moderate and severe concurrent events was concentrated in 1 4 y partly due to the low selected edd range this showed a gradual warming trend in the pingyuan area of the songliao plain in the correlation analysis between the relative meteorological output and the joint distribution probability only some areas passed the significance test northeast china has not yet created a long term and large scale warming mode which is generally concentrated on the slight increase and extension of the highest temperature and higher minimum temperature chen et al 2011 under water deficit conditions the decrease in transpiration saves soil water which might reduce the influence of heat manderscheid et al 2015 under the background of rain fed irrigation the principle that warming and drought simultaneously affect maize production including but not limited to yield needs to be further explored several points in our study require attention first the results provide a reference for understanding the occurrence and regularity of drought disaster concurrent events however crops in northeast china may suffer from freezing and waterlogging and from heat and drought due to climate change in the future studying the effect of various extreme weather events on crop production is required second the results provide a reference for the application of the cloud model and the copula function in agrometeorology and disaster risk assessment and management this method can further reduce the influence of system uncertainty on the error of evaluation results and can be explored further in future research however the accuracy of the cloud and copula models mainly depends on the classification of the disaster grades and the determination of the cloud characteristics of each grade the influence of precipitation and temperature on crops has a process of atmosphere soil vegetation due to the differences in regional hydrology meteorology and underlying surface conditions and the differences in temperature canopy temperature and underlying surface temperature the selection of composite disaster indicators and the classification standard of concurrent disaster are controversial the further application of the cloud and copula models should closely combine the disaster causing mechanism evolution law and risk causing mechanism of disasters on crops and reveal the new characteristics of agrometeorological disasters under the background of climate change 6 conclusions a probability assessment method of concurrent events during different growth stages of maize based on precipitation and temperature indexes was proposed the main objective of the present study was to introduce the cloud model to identify the uncertainties in the evaluation of complex systems and improve the objectivity and adaptability of the evaluation results then combined with the copula model the occurrence law of drought and high temperature combined disasters during different growth stages of maize was analyzed and applied in the songliao plain the application results were as follows 1 warming during the vgp and vrp mainly occurred in high latitude areas in the rgp the southern region had frequent high temperatures artificially delaying the growth period of maize makes it easier for maize to be exposed to high temperatures drought is still the main meteorological disaster affecting maize yield in the study area 2 the probability of the co occurrence of drought and heat increased from the southeast to the northwest during the rgp stage and the western region was more likely to be affected by moderate concurrent events the baicheng area was more likely to suffer from severe or greater concurrent events therefore these areas need to formulate effective and feasible countermeasures to mitigate and prevent losses caused by drought and heat disasters in summary the present study provides a meaningful reference for a better understanding of the occurrence laws of drought heat and concurrent events during crop growth periods and how to optimize the agricultural management of maize the present study also provides a basis for the future construction of multi disaster risk dynamic assessment technology although the proposed model provides a useful tool for evaluating multiple joint behaviors it fails to describe the complexity of drought and heat effects on crops comprehensive disaster hazard assessment depends on the construction of the assessment model and the disaster grade division therefore it is imperative to analyze the disaster causing mechanism quantify the risk and optimize the evaluation model under future climate change ways to apply this method to hazard assessment will be the focus of our future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

9816,due to global warming it is necessary to study the influence of extreme climate and concurrent events on crop growth the study area was the songliao plain where drought events frequently occur first the daily meteorological data of 14 meteorological stations from 1981 to 2016 were collected to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in the crop water surplus and deficit index extreme growing degree days and heat stress intensity during different growth stages of maize second the cloud model was used to describe the fuzziness of concurrent events simultaneous drought and heat and mutual mapping between qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken the fuzzy certainty degree of the influence of different degrees of concurrent events on maize was calculated third the copula function was used to describe the randomness of concurrent extreme events and calculate the joint probability distribution and return period an assessment method was proposed for concurrent events from the perspective of system uncertainty finally we analyzed the relationship between concurrent events and maize yield which showed different degrees of water deficit and warming trends during each growth period crops were most affected by extreme weather during the reproductive growth period rgp during the vegetative growth period vgp the temperature increase was higher than in other periods especially in the high latitude region the frequency of mild concurrent events was higher during the vgp and rgp during the vegetative and reproductive period the average occurrence probability of mild moderate and severe concurrent events was 21 9 1 7 and 0 35 respectively whereas during the rgp it was 23 1 8 2 and 0 12 respectively the present study provides a meaningful reference for a better understanding of the occurrence laws of drought heat and concurrent events during crop growth periods and how to optimize the agricultural management of maize keywords concurrent events high temperature climate change fuzziness randomness 1 introduction in the past century the earth has experienced significant global warming lobell et al 2011 ray et al 2019 wang and chen 2014 after a record heat event in 2015 the world meteorological organization told the international community that it would need to cope with a hotter drier and wetter future church et al 2013 agriculture is particularly sensitive to climate change climatic factors such as temperature precipitation radiation and wind speed affect the physiological development and yield of crops and abnormal changes cause various agricultural disasters chen et al 2016 killi et al 2017 miliauskienė et al 2016 due to increasing global food demand the temporal and spatial variation law of extreme weather and climate and the occurrence law of concurrent agrometeorological disaster events must be identified the present study will aid in making strategic decisions on food security and implementing policies technologies and strategies to adapt agriculture to climate change drought is a natural agricultural disaster with a wide range high frequency and long duration that threatens national food security mahrookashani et al 2017 climate change has led to an increase in the severity and duration of drought events in many areas of china often accompanied by heat and heat waves chen and sun 2017 miao et al 2016 sun et al 2014 heat and drought are two related but different constraints although heat may not cause drought it is likely to aggravate the degree of drought the occurrence of drought is complex and lagging whereas that of heat is short term and sudden combining these two natural disasters will have a far reaching effect on food security by shortening the crop growth period and reducing the crop production potential zandalinas et al 2018 for example in 2014 drought and a heat wave in california triggered wildfires and caused an agricultural water crisis aghakouchak et al 2014 in 2016 there was historic heat and drought in southeast asia qian et al 2019 research on the hazards and risks of the coexistence of various extreme meteorological events or agricultural disasters is limited leonard et al 2014 several studies have analyzed the challenges of the multi hazard framework aghakouchak et al 2014 mesbahzadeh et al 2020 wang et al 2019 sharma and mujumdar 2017 the combined stress of heat and drought severely affects wheat yield compared to a single stress factor mahrookashani et al 2017 matiu et al 2017 observed that maize yield decreased by 11 6 under dry and hot conditions but only by 7 8 under dry conditions using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and temperature data lobell et al 2015 reported that the effect of heat events is increasing and heat factors should be considered when carrying out drought risk management thus the traditional univariate risk assessment method based on precipitation conditions may significantly underestimate the risk of extreme events because it ignores the influence of temperature fang et al 2019 wang et al 2018a evaluated the risk of drought and heat events during the growth period of summer maize in the huang huai hai plain using spei during critical growth periods combined with the cumulative distribution function and climate trend rate miao et al 2016 comprehensively analyzed the joint probabilistic characteristics and tendencies for bivariate and trivariate precipitation and temperature indices based on the copula theory from previous studies the relationship between meteorological factors and crop yield has been established based on deterministic methods or via model simulation and weight calculation using climatic factors these ignore the uncertainty of the crop itself and the research system research on randomness and fuzziness of uncertain systems has advanced chen et al 2012 wu et al 2019 however few studies have combined the uncertainty study with a study of multiple extreme events in the field of meteorological disasters there are limited studies on the probability calculation of various extreme events therefore it is essential to understand the temporal and spatial variation law of crop water requirement etc effective rainfall pei and extreme heat heat stress intensity his and extreme growing degree days edd during a maize growth period and the occurrence of concurrent events of drought and heat in each period the primary purpose of the present study was to describe the randomness and fuzziness of drought and heat events on maize crops the maize producing area of the songliao plain was chosen as the study area we combined the cloud and copula models to analyze two natural disasters together and answered the following questions based on uncertainty a how do precipitation and extreme heat change during the different growth stages of maize b what is the condition of concurrent drought heat events in different degrees for maize in the study area c how are the joint distribution probability and co occurrence recurrence periods of compound stress distributed the present study provided a meaningful reference for a better understanding of the occurrence laws of drought heat and concurrent events during the crop growth period and the results can aid in protecting fragile agro ecosystems which is of great significance for further study on hazard quantification and risk assessment of various agricultural disasters and the rational allocation of water and heat resources to ensure food security 2 study area and data sources 2 1

precondition cloud generator algorithm representing uncertain phenomena has always been the focus of natural science research among the uncertainties randomness and fuzziness are the most critical chengguo et al 2018 mingyuan et al 2016 zheng jie et al 2014 the cloud model uses three numerical characterizations of expectation ex entropy en and super entropy he to associate fuzziness and randomness to form a map between qualitative and quantitative data dey and changyu 2004 ex is the point in the universe space that can best represent the qualitative concept c en reflects the uncertainty of qualitative concept c and the range of the number domain that can be accepted by the linguistic value in the number domain namely ambiguity he is the dispersion degree of entropy namely the entropy of entropy and reflects the cohesion of each numerical value representing the linguistic value certainty and the condensation degree of cloud droplets fig 2 after constructing the evaluation cloud he was determined by experience based on the uncertainty and randomness of specific indicators and subjective factors were strong which weakened the randomness of the cloud model therefore when building the composite disaster assessment cloud based on the principle of assessment grade division we used the reverse cloud generator to determine the he value in the assessment cloud making the assessment cloud more objective tursken 2006 simultaneously the multi attribute evaluation method was used to calculate the influence grade of drought and heat on maize growth and

constructed by marginal distribution and correlation structure to describe the dependence among variables its theory can be expressed as follows let x and y be continuous random variables and their marginal distribution functions are fx x and fy y respectively and the joint distribution function is f x y salvadori and de michele 2004 2010 if each marginal distribution function is continuous there is a unique copula function c u v which makes 15 f x y c f x x f y y c u v where f x y is the joint distribution function c represents the copula function u is the marginal distribution function

distribution function of variables and finally fitted and tested the copula in the present study the spearman coefficient was used to measure the correlation of the variables to be extracted for the marginal fitting 17 common distribution functions were selected table si 1 markov chain monte carlo simulation was used to calculate the parameters included in the copula function under the bayesian

revealed the changing roles of pei etc and cwsdi during different growth stages of spring maize in the study area fig 3 pei and cwsdi had similar trends during the vgp fig 3a 2012 was the mutation year in the cwsdi after 2012 the cwsdi changed from being stable to increasing pei increased after 2012 and broke through the reliability line of 1 98 of the m k mutation test in 2015 exhibiting a distinct upward trend the average value of pei was 134 77 mm in 2011 2016 and 98 95 mm in 2006 2010 the average value of etc in 2011 2016 was 139 43 mm in 1982 and 2004 there were extremely low points with pei 50 mm and cwsdi 75 belonging to extreme drought years during the vrp fig 3b the cwsdi in 1997 2000 2014 and 2015 was lower than 65 the mutation points of cwsdi occurred in 1997 and 2008 before 1997 cwsdi displayed a downward trend additionally the mutations of pei and etc occurred around 1997 in 1996 2000 pei was 83 25 mm and etc was 132 20 mm during 1991 1995 the average pei and etc were 114 84 and 118 17 mm respectively the average pei in 2001 2005 and 2006 2010 were 89 77 and 96 46 mm respectively and the average etc were 126 74 and 121 92 mm after 2008 it showed a significant downward trend again the pei in 2016 was only 68 04 mm during the rgp fig 3c the mutation of cwsdi occurred in 1999 the average values of pei and etc before 1999 were 153 86 and 192 13 mm respectively whereas after 1999 these values were 129 and 196 71 mm respectively the mean value of cwsdi decreased from 0 19 to 0 34 during the wgp fig 3d the overall trend of pei and etc was similar to that in rgp the mutation period occurred around 1992 pei fluctuated significantly and the study area was in water deficit except for the vgp the yield of maize in the study area might be reduced due to insufficient irrigation the annual pei etc and cwsdi of the three growth periods vgp vrp and rgp were calculated and their multi year average values were measured the inverse distance weighting method was used for spatial interpolation and the distribution of water resources in the study area was analyzed fig 4 the ranges of etc pei and cwsdi were 81 222 mm 41 205 mm and 55 1 respectively there were pronounced differences during each growth period in the vgp the etc was 128 175 mm fig 4a1 except for yingkou the pei in most areas was between 68 and 123 mm and the cwsdi changed significantly in the entire region gradually decreasing from the north to south except in harbin and baicheng the cwsdi in most areas ranged from 46 to 28 fig 4c1 in the vgp the water supply was deficient in most years in the vrp the etc in most areas ranged from 100 to 152 mm fig 4a2 however the etc in shuangliao was 199 mm pei was concentrated between 68 and 123 mm fig 4b2 the demand for water by crops began to increase the cwsdi ranged between 28 and 8 and the drought in the entire region was light fig 4c2 in rgp the etc ranged from 175 to 222 mm fig 4a3 and pei showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast fig 4b3 the pei in northwest china was 68 123 mm whereas that in southeast china was 150 205 mm additionally the cwsdi during this period showed an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast fig 4c3 the drought in baicheng da an qianan changling and shuangyang was particularly severe in most years precipitation was insufficient and evaporation was large 4 1 2 temporal and spatial variation of heat the change laws of edd and hsi during each growth period of maize in 35 y were calculated in the present study by simultaneously calculating the average maximum temperature fig 5 the heat stress in the high latitudes north was more severe than that in the low latitudes south during the vgp and vrp fig 5a in the rgp there was a trend of severe heat stress fig 5a3 and baicheng da an and qianguo showed a high temperature trend fig 5b3 although the northern region was generally colder xiaoqing et al 2015 hsi in the northern region was more severe than that in the southern region during the vgp and vrp the growth period was delayed in the northern areas especially the jointing and mature stages fig si 1 the growth period in the northern region was delayed more severely leading to maize being exposed to more heat than other regions in the vgp and vrp the maximum hsi in high latitude areas northwest was above 34 c in the vgp the average edd in northwest china was 7 8 c d which was twice as high as that in the low latitudes southeast fig 5a1 in the vrp the average edd in northwest china was 6 5 c d fig 5a2 in rgp hsi was above 32 fig 5b3 and edd was 18 c d fig 5a3 the spatial variation of the mean value of the heat stress index was small over the last 35 years the high latitude areas northwest in songliao plain have been under severe heat stress during vgp and vrp the maximum value of hsi ranged between 33 5 c and 34 5 c and the maximum value of edd was 38 2 c d in the rgp the heat stress in low latitude areas southeast was severe the maximum value of hsi ranged between 33 0 c and 34 0 c and the maximum value of edd was 75 4 c d during the rgp hsi showed a slight upward trend after 2010 during the vgp hsi showed an apparent upward trend after 1990 and exceeded the reliability line of 1 98 in 2002 2005 2011 and 2014 reaching a significant level during the vrp hsi showed a significant downward trend from 1981 to 1997 fell below the reliability line of 1 98 in 1990 and then showed an increasing trend simultaneously the annual average maximum temperature in the fig 5c2 is similar to the trend of hsi the average temperature is often higher after a sudden change year with this phenomenon requiring further study 4 2 uncertainty analysis of concurrent drought heat events first we corrected the data chose a constant multiplied it by cwsdi called it relative cwsdi and then fitted it to the cloud model positive integer 1 was chosen as constant during 1981 2016 cwsdi 0 55 in the vgp and cwsdi 0 65 in the vrp and when the maximum temperature 33 then drought and extreme heat events occurred together during the rgp and wgp periods cwsdi 0 65 and when the highest temperature 30 drought and extreme heat events occurred together additionally the edd was graded by percentile where n eddmax eddmin for extremely high temperatures of different degrees n was 10 30 and 80 the drought grade standard of the cwsdi of maize was determined based on the drought grade of the water deficit index specified in the drought grade standard of spring maize in north china china meteorological administration 2015 and historical disaster data of typical representative stations in the study area composite events were divided into three levels according to cwsdi and edd levels three cloud characteristic values table 3 and conceptual cloud models fig si 2 of each drought disaster risk grade were obtained from the interval threshold the similarity k of c to c was calculated using the cloud algorithm and the maximum value was retrieved the evaluation result corresponding to the maximum value was the impact degree of the corresponding concurrent events on crops from 1981 to 2016 in the vgp there were five events above level iii in baicheng da an shuangliao and xinmin in the vrp baicheng da an qianan qianguo changtu and xinmin had more than five level ⅲ events and more than 10 level ⅱ events more than 10 level ⅲ events occurred in changling and nong an in the rgp baicheng da an qianan qianguo changling nong an and shuangliao had more than five level ⅲ events the period was divided into three intervals 1981 1992 1993 2004 and 2005 2016 the frequencies of concurrent events in different degrees during the three periods were calculated fig 6 the frequency of level i concurrent events was higher in vgp and rgp level ⅱ events occurred more frequently in vrp harbin shuangliao and benxi were the regions where level i events in the vgp showed an apparent and continuous increasing trend during all three periods in the vgp level i events showed an apparent and continuous decreasing trend in changling whereas in the rgp it was only found in baicheng in the vrp level ii concurrent events showed an apparent and continuous increasing trend in benxi whereas a decreasing trend was seen in qianan changling shuangliao xinmin and shenyang and occurrence probability of level iii events in qianan changling and xinmin continued to increase 4 3 probability analysis of concurrent drought heat events the copula function was used to establish the joint distribution probability and recurrence period which can reflect the risk of joint events to evaluate the occurrence regularity of drought and heat during the growth period of spring maize 4 3 1 construction of marginal distribution function to construct the copula joint distribution function effectively the appropriate marginal distribution function of cwsdi and edd was determined during the vrp and rgp both drought and heat have a high occurrence probability with heat having the most significant impact on maize yield gao et al 2012 therefore the present study performed a bivariate analysis of the vrp and rgp of maize at 14 stations a total of 17 marginal distribution functions were used to fit cwsdi and edd and aic and rmse were selected to determine the optimal marginal distribution function the chi square test was used to estimate the parameters of the marginal distribution function and the kolmogorov smirnov method was used to evaluate the gof all optimal distributions passed the α 0 05 significance test tables si 3 and si 4 gpd gev normal logistic and evd were used in the present study table si 2 before establishing the joint distribution function we used the kendall rank correlation coefficient τ and spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ to test the correlation between cwsdi and edd in vrp the τ values were above 0 2 maximum 0 49 baicheng and the ρ values were above 0 25 maximum 0 69 baicheng the τ value in rgp was above 0 2 except in qianguo the maximum value was 0 44 in songliao ρ values were all above 0 2 the maximum value was 0 53 in baicheng all correlation coefficients passed the significance tests of α 0 01 0 05 and 0 2 indicating that a few sites had a strong correlation most sites had medium intensity correlation and some sites had a weak correlation 4 3 2 probability analysis based on copula function the construction of the copulas function is the premise to further understand the joint probability distribution the method to preprocess the data in the present study was the same as that for the cloud model you et al 2018 table 4 shows the optimal coupling function and its parameters for the vrp and rgp of maize at each station in the study area we used the aic bic nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and rmse to test the gof the gof evaluation of the copula function met the standard therefore the optimal copula functions of rgp were mainly gaussian copula and frank copula whereas vrp was mainly gaussian copula 4 3 3 analysis of joint probability and return period based on copula function based on the copula function at each station the probability of heat and drought conditions and the co occurrence return period were calculated probability and co occurrence return periods are representative of concurrent event risk a shorter co occurrence return period represents a higher risk using these we could describe the risk of concurrent events the degree of certainty of each sample point and the influence level of composite events were calculated using the two dimensional precondition cloud generator algorithm the grouping of the influence degree of concurrent events for maize was consistent with the grouping constructed using the cloud model in the vrp the average occurrence probability of mild ⅰ moderate ⅱ and severe ⅲ concurrent events was 21 9 1 7 and 0 35 respectively fig 7 the conditional probability of moderate drought heat events decreased from the northwest to the southeast and the maximum value appeared around baicheng reaching 50 fig 7a1 there was a 1 4 y periodical oscillation which occurred frequently harbin shuangyang yongji had a long return period of more than three years fig 7b1 the occurrence probability of severe events was small and the presentation range was similar to that of moderate events fig 7a2 the return period in the south and northwest was 5 20 y and the return period of more than 20 y covered an extensive range fig 7b2 the joint occurrence probability of extremely severe events was extremely low with a maximum probability of 1 12 fig 7a3 the return period of concurrent events was longer in most areas of the entire study area and was approximately 30 100 y in only a few surrounding areas fig 7b3 in the rgp the average occurrence probability of ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ concurrent events was 23 1 8 2 and 0 12 respectively and the maximum occurrence probability of moderate concurrent events was 50 7 mainly concentrated in baicheng and da an overall the conditional probability of occurrence of concurrent events showed a downward trend from the west to the east fig 7c1 the co occurrence return period was concentrated in 1 3 y occurring frequently fig 7d1 the joint probability distribution of severe concurrent events was similar to that of moderate disasters however the probability of occurrence in most areas was lower than 16 fig 7c2 the return period of co occurrence increased from the south to the north primarily from 1 to 2 5 y in the south and from 2 to 5 y in the north fig 7d2 the occurrence of extremely severe disasters in the study area was an extremely low probability event fig 7c3 the co occurrence return period in the south was more than 100 y the likelihood of extremely heavy concurrent events was low and the return period in very few areas was approximately 20 50 y fig 7d3 there was a warming trend in the study area however most had small warming ranges from the time trend analysis the probability of concurrent events of various degrees increased from 2011 to 2016 5 discussion previous studies on natural disasters have primarily focused on a single meteorological factor the occurrence of a disaster may be the extreme state of a single variable however it is more likely to be the result of a combination of variables it is necessary to know more about the non stationarity of the climate system and the combination principle of climatic variables to understand the process and principle of complex disasters to recognize quantify and prevent risks climate warming promotes drought formation and aggravates its severity cairns et al 2013 castro nava et al 2014 lipiec et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 found that drought was the most common extreme weather event after 2000 and its influence was expanding adversely affecting the growth and development of maize liu et al 2013b observed that high latitudes in the northern hemisphere were more susceptible to climate change by comparing the research results of many countries and the northern boundary of maize planting in the northeast had extended northward additionally the application of model simulation confirmed that the climate warming in northeast china has reached the level that will affect the growth of maize liu et al 2013a thus it is indisputable that crops are exposed to and affected by heat coumou et al 2013 yin et al 2016b the results in the present study showed that pei distribution in the vgp was increasing during the vrp and rgp etc showed a downward trend whereas the crop water demand increased this trend appeared more frequently after 2000 especially during the rgp stage figs 4 and 5 the pei of maize during different growth stages along the songliao plain showed a decreasing trend from the southeast to the northwest with the northwest region expected to face more effects from frequent and severe droughts yin et al 2016a zhang and hu 2018 during the vgp and vrp hsi in the high latitudes was more severe than that in the low latitudes in the rgp edd changed more increasing from south to north fig 6 which was contrary to the trend of pei heat affects rainfall and crop water demand to a certain extent and promotes drought however during other critical growth periods only a few stations showed a significant warming trend with apparent regional differences previous studies have confirmed the temperature increase in northeast china li et al 2020b li and amatus 2020 guo et al 2020 and guna et al 2019 used excess heat factors and spei to analyze climate change in china li et al 2020a analyzed the summer heat and drought in northeast china based on greenhouse emissions their results verified that the frequency of drought and heat would increase further from a future climate model our findings were similar to those of previous studies according to the spatial and temporal law most areas in the study area are in a state of worsening drought and increasing heat events drought events occurred more frequently in 2005 2016 than in 1981 1992 and 1993 2004 the characteristics of 2004 2011 and 2014 included low pei and high temperature this was the same as the typical drought year recorded in the disaster ceremony and disaster record provided by the china meteorological data network additionally wang et al 2018b showed similar results from the similarity of composite events calculated using the cloud model most areas in the study area showed level iii events during these years previous study results have shown a phenomenon of high temperature in northeast china however the negative effect on yield can be eliminated by changing planting boundaries and plant varieties or increasing irrigation zhao et al 2014 siebert et al 2017 moreover extreme temperatures will have varying influences across northeast china liu et al 2012 some researchers support that heating alone cannot have a critical negative effect on the growth of maize chen et al 2011 the present study showed that the occurrence probability of moderate and higher concurrent events in the vrp and the rgp of plants was higher in northwest china which was consistent with the analysis results of the drought heat events occurrence law in the rgp the return period of moderate and severe concurrent events was concentrated in 1 4 y partly due to the low selected edd range this showed a gradual warming trend in the pingyuan area of the songliao plain in the correlation analysis between the relative meteorological output and the joint distribution probability only some areas passed the significance test northeast china has not yet created a long term and large scale warming mode which is generally concentrated on the slight increase and extension of the highest temperature and higher minimum temperature chen et al 2011 under water deficit conditions the decrease in transpiration saves soil water which might reduce the influence of heat manderscheid et al 2015 under the background of rain fed irrigation the principle that warming and drought simultaneously affect maize production including but not limited to yield needs to be further explored several points in our study require attention first the results provide a reference for understanding the occurrence and regularity of drought disaster concurrent events however crops in northeast china may suffer from freezing and waterlogging and from heat and drought due to climate change in the future studying the effect of various extreme weather events on crop production is required second the results provide a reference for the application of the cloud model and the copula function in agrometeorology and disaster risk assessment and management this method can further reduce the influence of system uncertainty on the error of evaluation results and can be explored further in future research however the accuracy of the cloud and copula models mainly depends on the classification of the disaster grades and the determination of the cloud characteristics of each grade the influence of precipitation and temperature on crops has a process of atmosphere soil vegetation due to the differences in regional hydrology meteorology and underlying surface conditions and the differences in temperature canopy temperature and underlying surface temperature the selection of composite disaster indicators and the classification standard of concurrent disaster are controversial the further application of the cloud and copula models should closely combine the disaster causing mechanism evolution law and risk causing mechanism of disasters on crops and reveal the new characteristics of agrometeorological disasters under the background of climate change 6 conclusions a probability assessment method of concurrent events during different growth stages of maize based on precipitation and temperature indexes was proposed the main objective of the present study was to introduce the cloud model to identify the uncertainties in the evaluation of complex systems and improve the objectivity and adaptability of the evaluation results then combined with the copula model the occurrence law of drought and high temperature combined disasters during different growth stages of maize was analyzed and applied in the songliao plain the application results were as follows 1 warming during the vgp and vrp mainly occurred in high latitude areas in the rgp the southern region had frequent high temperatures artificially delaying the growth period of maize makes it easier for maize to be exposed to high temperatures drought is still the main meteorological disaster affecting maize yield in the study area 2 the probability of the co occurrence of drought and heat increased from the southeast to the northwest during the rgp stage and the western region was more likely to be affected by moderate concurrent events the baicheng area was more likely to suffer from severe or greater concurrent events therefore these areas need to formulate effective and feasible countermeasures to mitigate and prevent losses caused by drought and heat disasters in summary the present study provides a meaningful reference for a better understanding of the occurrence laws of drought heat and concurrent events during crop growth periods and how to optimize the agricultural management of maize the present study also provides a basis for the future construction of multi disaster risk dynamic assessment technology although the proposed model provides a useful tool for evaluating multiple joint behaviors it fails to describe the complexity of drought and heat effects on crops comprehensive disaster hazard assessment depends on the construction of the assessment model and the disaster grade division therefore it is imperative to analyze the disaster causing mechanism quantify the risk and optimize the evaluation model under future climate change ways to apply this method

9817,earthworms are ecological engineers that play an important role in hydrological processes and soil erosion by their burrowing and casting activities little is known however about the ecological function of the activities of an anecic species metaphire guillelmi from the loess plateau in china where the soil is severely eroded we conducted rain simulation experiments on artificial slopes mesocosms filled with soil from loess plateau two rain intensities 90 and 120 mm h 1 and slope gradients 5 and 15 were used to investigate the influences of earthworm activity on runoff and soil loss under multiple conditions data from 15 d of earthworm activity and 1 h of rain indicated that earthworm activity significantly reduced runoff but aggravated soil erosion runoff initiation time increased 2 7 3 1 fold contributing to the promotion of water infiltration and the amounts and rates of runoff were 35 8 61 6 and 35 1 60 8 lower under earthworm activity than the controls respectively earthworms greatly influenced the physical and chemical properties of the soil and these properties were strongly correlated with runoff initiation time and cumulative runoff the surface casts produced by the earthworms on the soil surface were completely dispersed increasing the cumulative sediment by a maximum of 169 both rain intensity and slope gradient greatly influence runoff and soil detachment but with earthworm activity slope gradient was more influential due to its superior contribution to sediment transport this study quantified the effects of m guillelmi on runoff and soil erosion and provides basic data for developing a more integrated control of soil erosion on the loess plateau keywords earthworm runoff erosion bare slope simulated rain loess plateau 1 introduction earthworms represent the most animal biomass in many terrestrial ecosystems and are recognised as one of the typical soil engineers due to their large effects on soil formation soil structure water regulation and nutrient cycling lavelle et al 1997 byers et al 2006 blouin et al 2013 ferlian et al 2019 earthworms regulate ecosystem services mainly by affecting the physical and chemical properties of soil soil pore characteristics can be affected by the burrowing behavior of earthworms and soil organic carbon content soc soil particle composition and aggregate formation are influenced by earthworm casting activity blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2008a blouin et al 2013 then the hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff and erosion are consequently influenced the functions of earthworms vary with species anecic species feed on litter in topsoil or organic matter from the soil and live in vertical burrows to a depth of 3 m lee 1985 blouin et al 2013 studies have reported that anecic earthworms greatly influence soil properties and hydrological processes 1 the burrowing activities of large individuals that affect soil porosity and pore distribution 2 constructing vertical burrows and keeping the burrows open on the soil surface and 3 depositing large amounts of aggregates on the surface thereby increasing surface roughness jouquet et al 2008a blouin et al 2013 andriuzzi et al 2015 some studies have reported that increased soil porosity and surface roughness due to the burrowing and casting by earthworms improved water infiltration reduced the rate and amount of surface runoff and ultimately reduced soil erosion le bayon et al 2002 blanchart et al 2004 blouin et al 2013 the deposition of biogenic aggregates by earthworm activity in the humid tropics covering 60 of the soil surface reduced runoff volume by 75 relative to ambient treatments jouquet et al 2008b an increase in the rate of infiltration by anecic burrowing activity decreased soil erosion by 50 in temperate ecosystems sharpley et al 1979 shuster et al 2002 some studies however have indicated that casts generated by anecic earthworms exacerbated soil erosion even though they effectively decreased runoff jouquet et al 2008a unstable earthworm casts deposited on soil surfaces are potential sources of loss of soil and nutrients and become an important cause of soil erosion blanchart et al 2004 blouin et al 2013 the morphological characteristics organic matter content destruction and degradation of surface casts are particularly important to soil erosion mainly by their controls on cast stability decaëns 2000 shipitalo and le bayon 2004 for example globular and granular casts have different soil structural stability and affect soil erosion in opposite ways jouquet et al 2013 reported that the granular casts created by metaphire posthunma in a tropical rainforest were less stable than the surrounding soil these casts were easily scattered and washed away by rainwater resulting in an increasing loss of soil granular casts dispersed by rainwater also easily create surface crust and increase soil erosion shuster et al 2000 blanchart et al 2004 globular casts which comprised of large aggregates with high stability usually increase water infiltration and reduce soil erosion blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2008b 2012 however even globular casts which have stable structures relative to the surrounding soil physicogenic aggregates and granular casts can be entirely degraded when fresh le bayon et al 2002 mariani et al 2007 hindell et al 1997 proposed a dispersion index to quantify earthworm cast stability which was calculated as the optical density of mechanically dispersed clay divided by the optical density of ultrasonically dispersed clay the dispersion index of the casts decreased from 0 4 to 0 25 after 32 d deposition and decreased to 0 01 after 21 d air drying in a temperate climate hindell et al 1997 hence casts need a relatively long time to become stable but intense earthworm activity and rain during the growing season on the loess plateau hinder the formation of stable casts anecic earthworm species whose activities strongly affect the soil surface may thus increase the risk of soil erosion for this area earthworms are excellent partners to humans for managing ecosystem services byers et al 2006 the function of earthworms on hydrological processes and soil erosion in different terrestrial ecosystems have been paid much attention but surprisingly been poorly studied in china the loess plateau has long suffered from severe soil erosion after a variety of measures for soil and water conservation in the past decades 30 of the soil in this area remains stable and vegetation coverage increased up to 50 yao et al 2011 wang et al 2012 water and soil loss were therefore effectively controlled huang and shao 2019 the improvement of the ecological environment has been conducive to the colonisation of soil animals which have important effects on ecosystem functions and services geophagous earthworm metaphire guillelmi is a dominant anecic species in this area with a density of 70 120 individuals m 2 and a general weight of 5 10 g for mature individuals m guillelmi builds semi permanent vertical burrows opening to the soil surface forages at the soil surface for organic detritus and soil particles and produces fertile casts within soil and on its surface zhang et al 2000 li et al 2017 2018 2019 recently conducted a series of studies focusing on the roles of soil fauna on hydrological processes on the loess plateau mole crickets in this area produced many burrows that averaged 1 51 cm in diameter and 46 3 cm in depth these macropores increased infiltration and decreased runoff li et al 2018 ant nests created by the burrowing activity also decreased the rate of runoff by 13 31 under different rain intensities li et al 2019 both crickets and ants though increased the potential of soil erosion by transporting small soil particles on the surface li et al 2018 earthworms are major soil macrofauna in the central and southern areas of the loess plateau but their ecological effects have received little attention although the effects of earthworm on runoff and soil erosion have raised great attention in many areas blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2013 orgiazzi and panagos 2018 muoni et al 2019 there is still a lack of information on the loess plateau rain intensity and slope are two important factors influencing hydrological processes and soil erosion on the loess plateau huang and shao 2019 the effects of earthworms on soil erosion can also highly related to the rain intensity and slope jouquet et al 2012 noted the net effect of earthworms on soil erosion is site specific and dependent on land slope le bayon and binet 1999 found the splash effect of rainfall due to the kinetics of the drops could disrupt earthworm casts and contribute to erosion we conducted rain simulation experiments on artificial soil slopes to quantitatively investigate the effect of m guillelmi activities on 1 initiation time a critical parameter for determining the time and volume of water running off the soil surface and evaluating soil infiltration capacity volume and rate of runoff and 2 sediment yield and rate of soil loss under different rain intensities and slope gradients quantifying the effects of earthworms on runoff and soil erosion will increase our understanding of the ecological function of soil macrofauna on the loess plateau and will provide basic information for further studies of the contributions of soil macrofauna in conserving water and soil in this area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and earthworms

china the area is in the southern part of the loess plateau and is characterised by a semi humid temperate climate mean annual temperature is 12 9 c and mean annual precipitation is 637 mm li et al 2004 the typical soil type is lou soil which is a clayey loam described as a cumulic anthrosol fao unesco preliminary investigation indicated that the loess plateau harbours many earthworms metaphire guillelmi was the dominant species with a density of 70 120 individuals m 2 rain intensities during storms in regions of china with semi humid climates generally range from 90 to 120 mm h 1 cai et al 1998 the slope gradients of 5 and 15 have been classified as gentle and steep slopes respectively in fields on the loess plateau zhao et al 2014a 2014b we used rectangular metal containers 1 0 m in length 0 5 m in width 0 5 m in height hereafter called mesocosms to simulate sloping fields by filling them with lou soil collected from the 0 1 m layer of an abandoned cropland in yangling and with earthworms collected from a local field each mesocosm had 164 holes on the bottom and was packed with 10 cm of sand on the bottom to allow free drainage the study was designed as a three factorial experiment 1 earthworm activities with and without earthworms 2 two rain intensities 90 and 120 mm h 1 and 3 two slope gradients 5 and 15 a total of 24 mesocosms were prepared with three replicates per treatment included 12 mesocosms with earthworms and 12 mesocosms without earthworms the soil was air dried to a gravimetric moisture content of 12 and sieved through a 5 mm mesh and then compacted stepwise in the mesocosms to a depth of 40 cm with a density of 1 3 g cm 3 the soil was moistened with distilled water to a gravimetric water content of 20 the basic chemical and physical properties of the soils for the mesocosms before the simulated rain were presented in table 1 the dominant anecic species m guillelmi was selected in this study fifty earthworms were introduced to each mesocosm corresponding to a density of approximately 100 individuals m 2 similar to the density in the field 70 120 individuals m 2 the mesocosms were then covered by a mesh fabric and placed in a humid laboratory connected to the outdoors for 15 d at a temperature of 20 30 c in order to collect soil samples before the simulated rainfall without destroying the mesocosm slopes eight plastic containers 51 cm in length 37 cm in width 30 cm in height were prepared at the same the containers were filled to 20 cm depth with the same soil and method as described above and placed in the same laboratory with mesocosms for 15 d four of the containers were used as controls and earthworms were introduced to the other four containers 2 2 rain simulation experiment experiments with simulated rain were carried out after 15 d of earthworm activity in the mesocosms the rain simulation system was designed and manufactured by the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming detailed information about the system has been provided by shi et al 2012 and li et al 2019 the simulated rain experiments also included control mesocosms where earthworms were not introduced the duration of rain for each treatment was 1 h and runoff and sediment were collected every 2 min after runoff initiation the time start to generate continuous runoff was recorded as the runoff initiation time 2 3 sampling and analysis samples of runoff water and sediment were collected in aluminium pots and were weighed immediately the pots were left to stand for 24 h to completely separate the water and sediment most of the runoff water was extracted with injectors leaving the wet sediment in the pots the sediment samples were oven dried at 40 c for 4 7 d until completely dry and then reweighed for calculating the amount of runoff water mm and sediment g m 2 the data for cumulative runoff and sediment were used to calculate change rate cr for quantifying the effect of earthworm activity on runoff and soil loss 1 cr x x e x c x c 100 where x is the variable cumulative runoff and cumulative sediment in this study xe and xc are the variable value of the treatment with earthworms and control respectively soil samples were collected after 15 d earthworm incubation to determine the effects of earthworms on soil structure and properties approximate 10 g of disturbed soil samples were randomly collected from the 0 5 cm depth of each mesocosm and then air dried for measuring soc content total nitrogen tn content and particle size distribution psd soc and tn contents were measured using the walkley black and kjeldahl methods respectively page et al 1982 psd was measured using laser diffraction mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england after removing organic matter and calcium carbonate three soil cores were collected using 100 cm3 cutting ring at the 0 10 cm depth of soil from each plastic container for measuring the bulk density then soil samples for aggregate determination were collected from same depth using a trowel to minimize compression water stable aggregate content was determined using the sieve method yoder 1936 the mean weight diameter mwd mm of the aggregates was calculated to assess the effect of earthworm activity on aggregate stability 2 mwd i 1 n x i w i where xi is the mean diameter mm of aggregate fraction class i and wi is the weight fraction of each class the images of the soil surface roughness were determined using a total station scanner nova ms50 multistation leica geosystems heerbrugg switzerland before and after rain simulation to show the variation in soil surface in treatments with earthworms before and after rainfall fig 1b and c 2 4 statistical analysis a three way anova was used to investigate the effects of factors earthworm activity rain intensity and slope gradient and their interactions on runoff initiation time cumulative runoff and cumulative sediment one way anova was used to determine whether there are any significant differences in the cumulative runoff cumulative sediment and soil physico chemical properties between the treatments with and without earthworms the statistical analysis was done using spss 20 0 spss inc chicago usa all differences were tested at p 0 05 standard errors of means are presented in the tables and figures as a parameter of variability 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical properties of soil earthworm activity disturbed 70 of the soil surface and greatly affected aggregate formation creating many casts and soil clods fig 1a the m guillelmi casts were elliptical or globular and consisted of small globular aggregates and the soil clods were angular pieces with flat surfaces created and lifted by earthworm burrowing the sizes of the casts and soil clods were similar in length and width but the height of the soil clods averaged only 0 9 cm which was approximately 60 lower than for the casts earthworms have great impacts on the soil physical and chemical properties table 1 compared to the initial condition bulk density increased in all treatments after 15 d due to the compaction of the soil from the addition of water bulk density for the treatments with earthworms averaged 1 38 g cm 3 which was 4 lower than the controls clay contents in the treatments with earthworms were 1 21 fold greater than those in controls while silt content decreased by 2 92 the treatments with earthworms were characterized by higher tn contents p 0 05 but no significant differences were found for soc contents compared to the control treatments the surface soil was less stable under earthworm activity table 2 the treatments with earthworms had significantly lower contents of water stable macroaggregates diameters 0 25 mm than in the controls and this was mainly owing to the contents of the much less aggregates with diameters of 2 5 mm mwd decreased from 0 74 mm to 0 56 mm with a 15 d earthworm activity p 0 05 3 2 water runoff on the slope earthworm activity significantly increased the time to initiate runoff p 0 05 tables 3 and 4 runoff initiation time was approximately 2 7 to 3 1 fold longer in the treatments with earthworms than the controls at a given rain intensity and slope a much shorter runoff initiation time was found for the 120 mm h 1 15 slope treatment than other treatments earthworm activities generally decreased runoff and increased soil loss fig 2 the cumulative amount of runoff in the treatments with earthworms was 38 4 64 2 of those in the controls and the largest reduction was found in the 120 mm h 1 5 slope treatment fig 2a and b the cumulative amount of runoff differed little between the two slope gradients for control treatments p 0 97 fig 2a but was higher for the 15 than the 5 slope for treatments with earthworms comparing to the 90 mm h 1 15 slope treatment a slightly lower cumulative runoff was observed in the 120 mm h 1 5 slope treatment fig 2b indicating a greater effect of slope gradient than rain intensity on runoff with earthworm activity distinct lower runoff rates were found in all treatments with earthworms compared to the controls p 0 05 fig 3 the runoff rate for the treatments with earthworms ranged from 0 6 to 1 2 mm min 1 which were only 40 3 72 4 of those in the controls in control treatments the initial runoff rates were strongly affected by rain intensity which in 120 mm h 1 rain intensity were 1 5 and 1 3 fold of those in 90 mm h 1 rain intensity in 5 and 15 slopes respectively in treatments with earthworms a higher initial rate was found in 120 mm h 1 15 slope treatment 0 8 mm min 1 than in other treatments 0 3 mm min 1 after the increase at the early stage the runoff rates were generally stable or slightly increased during the rain in all treatments except for the treatments with earthworms at 90 mm h 1 5 slope in which the runoff rate increased in the first 13 48 min and later decreased the runoff initiation time was positively correlated with clay content and tn but negatively with silt content table 5 the cumulative runoff however had a positive correlation with silt content and negative correlation with clay content and tn the stepwise regression analysis showed the silt content combined with clay content could account for 71 and 61 3 of the variance of runoff initiation time and cumulative runoff respectively table 6 the cumulative sediment was only positively correlated with tn p 0 05 3 3 soil loss on the slope the cumulative sediment was highest in the 120 mm h 1 15 slope treatment and lowest in the 90 mm h 1 5 slope treatment for all treatments with an increasing trend with rain intensity and slope gradient fig 2c and d earthworm activity aggravated the soil loss especially in 15 slope and most affected in the 90 mm h 1 15 slope treatment in which the cumulative sediment increased 2 7 fold with earthworm activity sediment yield rates were generally higher in the treatments with earthworms than the controls however the variations of sediment rates with rain duration differed between the controls and the treatments with earthworms fig 4 for the rain intensity of 90 mm h 1 the sediment yield rates in the treatments with earthworms averaged 18 1 and 36 1 g m 2 min 1 for the 5 and 15 slopes 1 6 and 2 7 fold higher than those in the controls respectively fig 4a and b the sediment yield rates in the controls varied little during the rain for the cases of 90 mm h 1 while in earthworm treatments were dramatically increased at the early stage and then gradually decreased over time for the rain intensity of 120 mm h 1 the averaged sediment yield rates were 34 8 and 74 5 g m 2 min 1 in the treatments with earthworms for the 5 and 15 slopes 1 1 and 1 4 fold higher than the controls respectively fig 4c and d the sediment yield rates in the treatments with earthworms generally increased during the rain for the 5 slope fig 4c but for the 15 slope it rapidly decreased at the early stage and then tended to be stable fig 4d earthworm activity led to a negative change rate for cumulative runoff but a positive change rate for cumulative sediment fig 5 a higher change rate in cumulative runoff was obtained in the 5 than the 15 slope but no regular variation was observed between treatments with different rain intensities for the cumulative sediment the change rates were higher for a rain intensity of 90 mm h 1 than 120 mm h 1 and was higher for the 15 than the 5 slope the change rate in cumulative sediment was highest in the 90 mm h 1 15 slope treatment at 169 and lowest in the 120 mm h 1 5 slope treatment at only 3 1 4 discussion 4 1 effects of earthworm activity on runoff earthworms are reported beneficial to reduce water runoff because their burrowing activity increases infiltration and the casts act as a physical barrier to runoff shipitalo and le bayon 2004 our results confirmed the negative effects of earthworm activity on surface runoff earthworm activity not only delayed the runoff initiation time but also dramatically decreased runoff by 28 4 60 6 relative to the controls table 3 fig 5 these values were much close to but slightly lower than the results obtained by le bayon and binet 2001 in temperate maize cropland the effects of earthworm activity on runoff however depends on earthworm species intrinsic soil properties and external factors lamandé et al 2011 compared to epigeic and endogeic earthworms the burrowing activity of anecic earthworms contributes more to the formation of soil macropores francis and fraser 1998 shipitalo and le bayon 2004 lamandé et al 2011 macropores connected with the surface can function as preferential pathways for water moving deep into the profile bastardie et al 2002 chan 2004 bailey et al 2015 li et al 2019 the vertical burrows made by anecic species are also considered as semi permanent structures and therefore increase the hydraulic conductivity and water infiltration nuutinen and butt 2003 blouin et al 2013 the widely distributed anecic earthworm in the study area therefore is expected to contribute greatly to the reduction in runoff changes in roughness and structure stability of soil surface caused by earthworm activity is an important influential factor of runoff rough soil surfaces caused by soil fauna animals and tillage greatly reduce runoff rates wang et al 2017 li et al 2019 runoff rates on gentle tropical slopes decreased from approximately 350 to 50 l m 2 y 1 when the surface coverage of free macroaggregates by earthworms increased from 20 to nearly 100 jouquet et al 2008b in the current study intense earthworm activity increased surface roughness by depositing a great number of casts and clods to a depth of approximately 3 cm fig 1a which is conducive to lower the surface runoff rates besides soc and clay which are known as major binding agents for aggregation six et al 2004 pulleman et al 2005 increased under earthworm activity table 1 thus the negative correlation between clay content and cumulative runoff table 5 p 0 05 could imply the positive effect of earthworm surface casts on decreasing runoff however cast stability depends on the texture of the parent soil and casts generated from clay and loam soils are less water stable than the natural soil aggregates schrader and zhang 1997 our study was consistent with this finding table 2 as a consequence the runoff rates were lower at the moment of runoff initiation under earthworm activity due to the high surface roughness but increased rapidly at the early stage of the rain as unstable casts and soil clods dispersed by raindrops and decreased the roughness fig 1b and c and fig 3 as noted above we suggest anecic earthworms reduce water runoff mainly through structuring semi permanent vertical burrows that increase water infiltration on the slope under simulated rainfall conditions 4 2 effects of earthworm activity on soil erosion the function of earthworms on soil erosion has been widely recognized le bayon et al 2002 blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2013 however whether earthworms had a positive or negative effect on soil erosion obtains different results some studies indicated that earthworms could effectively reduce soil erosion due to the greatly decreased runoff and the water stable surface casts shuster et al 2002 jouquet et al 2012 in contrast other studies showed that surface casts might increase soil detachment during rainstorm events and long rainy periods le bayon et al 2002 the different erodibility of surface casts is one of the main reasons for the opposite earthworm impacts on soil erosion fresh casts of some temperate species are more vulnerable to rain and other disturbances than dry casts and thus are easily dispersed and contribute to soil loss mariani et al 2007 in our study earthworm activity was significant during the 15 days which can be found in fig 1 although a mass of casts at different ageing stages and clods made by earthworms on soil surface enhance the surface roughness they were easy to be broken by intense rainfall and became potential sources of particulate which increase sediment concentration in runoff water fig s1 therefore the increased sediment in our study is a consequence of the dispersed surface casts and detached soil clods being washed away by runoff waters consistent with our results le bayon and binet 2001 found that sediment transport on temperate sloped land was 2 3 fold higher in treatments covered by surface casts than without casts and fresh casts degraded at a rate of 2 8 casts m 2 in the first 5 min of rain similarly a study of tropical anecic species also found that surface casts started to collapse within 30 s jouquet et al 2013 similar to runoff the impact of earthworms on soil erosion is usually site specific blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2012 aggravated soil erosion caused by earthworm activity is more likely to occur in the study area where has loose soil texture intense and frequent rain events in the summer leading to a disadvantage to the stabilization of aggregates huang and shao 2019 4 3 effects of rain intensity and slope rain intensity and slope are two predominant factors that influence the hydrological processes and erosion serrano muela et al 2015 especially on the loess plateau where has thousands of steep slopes and gullies huang and shao 2019 rain intensity mostly affects the amount of runoff soil detachment and sediment transport and slope mainly influences runoff and sediment transport zhang and wang 2017 rainfall is reported as the main agent of earthworm cast degradation and even casts with rather persistent structures can be locally dispersed by a storm decaëns 2000 surface casts are subjected to a considerable erosion process caused by rainfall at any time during their ageing process under field conditions mariani et al 2007 the study area often experienced heavy rainstorms in summer which may rapidly disintegrate the surface casts particularly the fresh casts and aggravate soil loss from slopes rainfall at the intensity of 90 and 120 mm h 1 both resulted in extreme degradation of surface casts in our experiment considering the cast erodibility as discussed above a high possibility that earthworms positively affect soil erosion is expected in the loess plateau area in the present work the slope gradient was found to be more influential than rain intensity on runoff volume and soil loss under earthworm activity runoff and sediment yield are directly affected by soil crust and rill development and the crust increases runoff discharge and decreased soil erosion carmi and berliner 2008 shi et al 2010 fang et al 2015 while under earthworm activity the formation of surface crust and rill development were greatly disturbed resulting in a much higher infiltration rate and thus less rainfall impact the dispersed cast and detached soil particulate during the rainfall were easier to be washed away by runoff water in steeper slopes this could explain the greater impacts of slope gradient than rain intensity nevertheless the response mechanisms of runoff and soil erosion to the interactions of earthworm activity rain intensity and slope gradient are complex a better understanding of the contribution of earthworm activity to soil erosion dynamics would require long term observations at the field scale 5 conclusion earthworm burrowing and casting activities have positive effects on delaying runoff initiation time and reducing the quantity and rate of runoff on the slope the low stability of fresh casts and soil clods on soil surface by frequent disturbance of earthworms contributed to severe soil erosion despite the great reduction in the magnitude of runoff the function of earthworms in reducing runoff was more obvious at lower slope gradient and in exacerbating soil erosion was more obvious at lower rain intensity and higher slope gradient in general slope gradient was more influential than rain intensity on runoff and soil erosion under earthworm activity the sediment rates were considerably higher when sedimentation was initiated but generally decreased with the disintegration of the surface casts during the rain soil aggregates with low water stability were mainly responsible for the increased soil loss under earthworm activity the stability of m guillelmi casts of different ages should thus be studied in the future to identify the mechanism of erosion caused by earthworms quantifying the effects of earthworm activity on the processes of runoff and soil

9817,earthworms are ecological engineers that play an important role in hydrological processes and soil erosion by their burrowing and casting activities little is known however about the ecological function of the activities of an anecic species metaphire guillelmi from the loess plateau in china where the soil is severely eroded we conducted rain simulation experiments on artificial slopes mesocosms filled with soil from loess plateau two rain intensities 90 and 120 mm h 1 and slope gradients 5 and 15 were used to investigate the influences of earthworm activity on runoff and soil loss under multiple conditions data from 15 d of earthworm activity and 1 h of rain indicated that earthworm activity significantly reduced runoff but aggravated soil erosion runoff initiation time increased 2 7 3 1 fold contributing to the promotion of water infiltration and the amounts and rates of runoff were 35 8 61 6 and 35 1 60 8 lower under earthworm activity than the controls respectively earthworms greatly influenced the physical and chemical properties of the soil and these properties were strongly correlated with runoff initiation time and cumulative runoff the surface casts produced by the earthworms on the soil surface were completely dispersed increasing the cumulative sediment by a maximum of 169 both rain intensity and slope gradient greatly influence runoff and soil detachment but with earthworm activity slope gradient was more influential due to its superior contribution to sediment transport this study quantified the effects of m guillelmi on runoff and soil erosion and provides basic data for developing a more integrated control of soil erosion on the loess plateau keywords earthworm runoff erosion bare slope simulated rain loess plateau 1 introduction earthworms represent the most animal biomass in many terrestrial ecosystems and are recognised as one of the typical soil engineers due to their large effects on soil formation soil structure water regulation and nutrient cycling lavelle et al 1997 byers et al 2006 blouin et al 2013 ferlian et al 2019 earthworms regulate ecosystem services mainly by affecting the physical and chemical properties of soil soil pore characteristics can be affected by the burrowing behavior of earthworms and soil organic carbon content soc soil particle composition and aggregate formation are influenced by earthworm casting activity blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2008a blouin et al 2013 then the hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff and erosion are consequently influenced the functions of earthworms vary with species anecic species feed on litter in topsoil or organic matter from the soil and live in vertical burrows to a depth of 3 m lee 1985 blouin et al 2013 studies have reported that anecic earthworms greatly influence soil properties and hydrological processes 1 the burrowing activities of large individuals that affect soil porosity and pore distribution 2 constructing vertical burrows and keeping the burrows open on the soil surface and 3 depositing large amounts of aggregates on the surface thereby increasing surface roughness jouquet et al 2008a blouin et al 2013 andriuzzi et al 2015 some studies have reported that increased soil porosity and surface roughness due to the burrowing and casting by earthworms improved water infiltration reduced the rate and amount of surface runoff and ultimately reduced soil erosion le bayon et al 2002 blanchart et al 2004 blouin et al 2013 the deposition of biogenic aggregates by earthworm activity in the humid tropics covering 60 of the soil surface reduced runoff volume by 75 relative to ambient treatments jouquet et al 2008b an increase in the rate of infiltration by anecic burrowing activity decreased soil erosion by 50 in temperate ecosystems sharpley et al 1979 shuster et al 2002 some studies however have indicated that casts generated by anecic earthworms exacerbated soil erosion even though they effectively decreased runoff jouquet et al 2008a unstable earthworm casts deposited on soil surfaces are potential sources of loss of soil and nutrients and become an important cause of soil erosion blanchart et al 2004 blouin et al 2013 the morphological characteristics organic matter content destruction and degradation of surface casts are particularly important to soil erosion mainly by their controls on cast stability decaëns 2000 shipitalo and le bayon 2004 for example globular and granular casts have different soil structural stability and affect soil erosion in opposite ways jouquet et al 2013 reported that the granular casts created by metaphire posthunma in a tropical rainforest were less stable than the surrounding soil these casts were easily scattered and washed away by rainwater resulting in an increasing loss of soil granular casts dispersed by rainwater also easily create surface crust and increase soil erosion shuster et al 2000 blanchart et al 2004 globular casts which comprised of large aggregates with high stability usually increase water infiltration and reduce soil erosion blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2008b 2012 however even globular casts which have stable structures relative to the surrounding soil physicogenic aggregates and granular casts can be entirely degraded when fresh le bayon et al 2002 mariani et al 2007 hindell et al 1997 proposed a dispersion index to quantify earthworm cast stability which was calculated as the optical density of mechanically dispersed clay divided by the optical density of ultrasonically dispersed clay the dispersion index of the casts decreased from 0 4 to 0 25 after 32 d deposition and decreased to 0 01 after 21 d air drying in a temperate climate hindell et al 1997 hence casts need a relatively long time to become stable but intense earthworm activity and rain during the growing season on the loess plateau hinder the formation of stable casts anecic earthworm species whose activities strongly affect the soil surface may thus increase the risk of soil erosion for this area earthworms are excellent partners to humans for managing ecosystem services byers et al 2006 the function of earthworms on hydrological processes and soil erosion in different terrestrial ecosystems have been paid much attention but surprisingly been poorly studied in china the loess plateau has long suffered from severe soil erosion after a variety of measures for soil and water conservation in the past decades 30 of the soil in this area remains stable and vegetation coverage increased up to 50 yao et al 2011 wang et al 2012 water and soil loss were therefore effectively controlled huang and shao 2019 the improvement of the ecological environment has been conducive to the colonisation of soil animals which have important effects on ecosystem functions and services geophagous earthworm metaphire guillelmi is a dominant anecic species in this area with a density of 70 120 individuals m 2 and a general weight of 5 10 g for mature individuals m guillelmi builds semi permanent vertical burrows opening to the soil surface forages at the soil surface for organic detritus and soil particles and produces fertile casts within soil and on its surface zhang et al 2000 li et al 2017 2018 2019 recently conducted a series of studies focusing on the roles of soil fauna on hydrological processes on the loess plateau mole crickets in this area produced many burrows that averaged 1 51 cm in diameter and 46 3 cm in depth these macropores increased infiltration and decreased runoff li et al 2018 ant nests created by the burrowing activity also decreased the rate of runoff by 13 31 under different rain intensities li et al 2019 both crickets and ants though increased the potential of soil erosion by transporting small soil particles on the surface li et al 2018 earthworms are major soil macrofauna in the central and southern areas of the loess plateau but their ecological effects have received little attention although the effects of earthworm on runoff and soil erosion have raised great attention in many areas blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2013 orgiazzi and panagos 2018 muoni et al 2019 there is still a lack of information on the loess plateau rain intensity and slope are two important factors influencing hydrological processes and soil erosion on the loess plateau huang and shao 2019 the effects of earthworms on soil erosion can also highly related to the rain intensity and slope jouquet et al 2012 noted the net effect of earthworms on soil erosion is site specific and dependent on land slope le bayon and binet 1999 found the splash effect of rainfall due to the kinetics of the drops could disrupt earthworm casts and contribute to erosion we conducted rain simulation experiments on artificial soil slopes to quantitatively investigate the effect of m guillelmi activities on 1 initiation time a critical parameter for determining the time and volume of water running off the soil surface and evaluating soil infiltration capacity volume and rate of runoff and 2 sediment yield and rate of soil loss under different rain intensities and slope gradients quantifying the effects of earthworms on runoff and soil erosion will increase our understanding of the ecological function of soil macrofauna on the loess plateau and will provide basic information for further studies of the contributions of soil macrofauna in conserving water and soil in this area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and earthworms the experiments were conducted at the rain simulation laboratory of the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of science and ministry of water resource yangling shaanxi province of china the area is in the southern part of the loess plateau and is characterised by a semi humid temperate climate mean annual temperature is 12 9 c and mean annual precipitation is 637 mm li et al 2004 the typical soil type is lou soil which is a clayey loam described as a cumulic anthrosol fao unesco preliminary investigation indicated that the loess plateau harbours many earthworms metaphire guillelmi was the dominant species with a density of 70 120 individuals m 2 rain intensities during storms in regions of china with semi humid climates generally range from 90 to 120 mm h 1 cai et al 1998 the slope gradients of 5 and 15 have been classified as gentle and steep slopes respectively in fields on the loess plateau zhao et al 2014a 2014b we used rectangular metal containers 1 0 m in length 0 5 m in width 0 5 m in height hereafter called mesocosms to simulate sloping fields by filling them with lou soil collected from the 0 1 m layer of an abandoned cropland in yangling and with earthworms collected from a local field each mesocosm had 164 holes on the bottom and was packed with 10 cm of sand on the bottom to allow free drainage the study was designed as a three factorial experiment 1 earthworm activities with and without earthworms 2 two rain intensities 90 and 120 mm h 1 and 3 two slope gradients 5 and 15 a total of 24 mesocosms were prepared with three replicates per treatment included 12 mesocosms with earthworms and 12 mesocosms without earthworms the soil was air dried to a gravimetric moisture content of 12 and sieved through a 5 mm mesh and then compacted stepwise in the mesocosms to a depth of 40 cm with a density of 1 3 g cm 3 the soil was moistened with distilled water to a gravimetric water content of 20 the basic chemical and physical properties of the soils for the mesocosms before the simulated rain were presented in table 1 the dominant anecic species m guillelmi was selected in this study fifty earthworms were introduced to each mesocosm corresponding to a density of approximately 100 individuals m 2 similar to the density in the field 70 120 individuals m 2 the mesocosms were then covered by a mesh fabric and placed in a humid laboratory connected to the outdoors for 15 d at a temperature of 20 30 c in order to collect soil samples before the simulated rainfall without destroying the mesocosm slopes eight plastic containers 51 cm in length 37 cm in width 30 cm in height were prepared at the same the containers were filled to 20 cm depth with the same soil and method as described above and placed in the same laboratory with mesocosms for 15 d four of the containers were used as controls and earthworms were introduced to the other four containers 2 2 rain simulation experiment experiments with simulated rain were carried out after 15 d of earthworm activity in the mesocosms the rain simulation system was designed and manufactured by the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming detailed information about the system has been provided by shi et al 2012 and li et al 2019 the simulated rain experiments also included control mesocosms where earthworms were not introduced the duration of rain for each treatment was 1 h and runoff and sediment were collected every 2 min after runoff initiation the time start to generate continuous runoff was recorded as the runoff initiation time 2 3 sampling and analysis samples of runoff water and sediment were collected in aluminium pots and were weighed immediately the pots were left to stand for 24 h to completely separate the water and sediment most of the runoff water was extracted with injectors leaving the wet sediment in the pots the sediment samples were oven dried at 40 c for 4 7 d until completely dry and then reweighed for calculating the amount of runoff water mm and sediment g m 2 the data for cumulative runoff and sediment were used to calculate change rate cr for quantifying the effect of earthworm activity on runoff and soil loss 1 cr x x e x c x c 100 where x is the variable cumulative runoff and cumulative sediment in this study xe and xc are the variable value of the treatment with earthworms and control respectively soil samples were collected after 15 d earthworm incubation to determine the effects of earthworms on soil structure and properties approximate 10 g of disturbed soil samples were randomly collected from the 0 5 cm depth of each mesocosm and then air dried for measuring soc content total nitrogen tn content and particle size distribution psd soc and tn contents were measured using the walkley black and kjeldahl methods respectively page et al 1982 psd was measured using laser diffraction mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england after removing organic matter and calcium carbonate three soil cores were collected using 100 cm3 cutting ring at the 0 10 cm depth of soil from each plastic container for measuring the bulk density then soil samples for aggregate determination were collected from same depth using a trowel to minimize compression water stable aggregate content was determined using the sieve method yoder 1936 the mean weight diameter mwd mm of the aggregates was calculated to assess the effect of earthworm activity on aggregate stability 2 mwd i 1 n x i w i where xi is the mean diameter mm of aggregate fraction class i and wi is the weight fraction of each class the images of the soil surface roughness were determined using a total station scanner nova ms50 multistation leica geosystems heerbrugg switzerland before and after rain simulation to show the variation in soil surface in treatments with earthworms before and after rainfall fig 1b and c 2 4 statistical analysis a three way anova was used to investigate the effects of

there are any significant differences in the cumulative runoff cumulative sediment and soil physico chemical properties between the treatments with and without earthworms the statistical analysis was done using spss 20 0 spss inc chicago usa all differences were tested at p 0 05 standard errors of means are presented in the tables and figures as a parameter of variability 3 results 3 1 physical and chemical properties of soil earthworm activity disturbed 70 of the soil surface and greatly affected aggregate formation creating many casts and soil clods fig 1a the m guillelmi casts were elliptical or globular and consisted of small globular aggregates and the soil clods were angular pieces with flat surfaces created and lifted by earthworm burrowing the sizes of the casts and soil clods were similar in length and width but the height of the soil clods averaged only 0 9 cm which was approximately 60 lower than for the casts earthworms have great impacts on the soil physical and chemical properties table 1 compared to the initial condition bulk density increased in all treatments after 15 d due to the compaction of the soil from the addition of water bulk density for the treatments with earthworms averaged 1 38 g cm 3 which was 4 lower than the controls clay contents in the treatments with earthworms were 1 21 fold greater than those in controls while silt content decreased by 2 92 the treatments with earthworms were characterized by higher tn contents p 0 05 but no significant differences were found for soc contents compared to the control treatments the surface soil was less stable under earthworm activity table 2 the treatments with earthworms had significantly lower contents of water stable macroaggregates diameters 0 25 mm than in the controls and this was mainly owing to the contents of the much less aggregates with diameters of 2 5 mm mwd decreased from 0 74 mm to 0 56 mm with a 15 d earthworm activity p 0 05 3 2 water runoff on the slope earthworm activity significantly increased the time to initiate runoff p 0 05 tables 3 and 4 runoff initiation time was approximately 2 7 to 3 1 fold longer in the treatments with earthworms than the controls at a given rain intensity and slope a much shorter runoff initiation time was found for the 120 mm h 1 15 slope treatment than other treatments earthworm activities generally decreased runoff and increased soil loss fig 2 the cumulative amount of runoff in the treatments with earthworms was 38 4 64 2 of those in the controls and the largest reduction was found in the 120 mm h 1 5 slope treatment fig 2a and b the cumulative amount of runoff differed little between the two slope gradients for control treatments p 0 97 fig 2a but was higher for the 15 than the 5 slope for treatments with earthworms comparing to the 90 mm h 1 15 slope treatment a slightly lower cumulative runoff was observed in the 120 mm h 1 5 slope treatment fig 2b indicating a greater effect of slope gradient than rain intensity on runoff with earthworm activity distinct lower runoff rates were found in all treatments with earthworms compared to the controls p 0 05 fig 3 the runoff rate for the treatments with earthworms ranged from 0 6 to 1 2 mm min 1 which were only 40 3 72 4 of those in the controls in control treatments the initial runoff rates were strongly affected by rain intensity which in 120 mm h 1 rain intensity were 1 5 and 1 3 fold of those in 90 mm h 1 rain intensity in 5 and 15 slopes respectively in treatments with earthworms a higher initial rate was found in 120 mm h 1 15 slope treatment 0 8 mm min 1 than in other treatments 0 3 mm min 1 after the increase at the early stage the runoff rates were generally stable or slightly increased during the rain in all treatments except for the treatments with earthworms at 90 mm h 1 5 slope in which the runoff rate increased in the first 13 48 min and later decreased the runoff initiation time was positively correlated with clay content and tn but negatively with silt content table 5 the cumulative runoff however had a positive correlation with silt content and negative correlation with clay content and tn the stepwise regression analysis showed the silt content combined with clay content could account for 71 and 61 3 of the variance of runoff initiation time and cumulative runoff respectively table 6 the cumulative sediment was only positively correlated with tn p 0 05 3 3 soil loss on the slope the cumulative sediment was highest in the 120 mm h 1 15 slope treatment and lowest in the 90 mm h 1 5 slope treatment for all treatments with an increasing trend with rain intensity and slope gradient fig 2c and d earthworm activity aggravated the soil loss especially in 15 slope and most affected in the 90 mm h 1 15 slope treatment in which the cumulative sediment increased 2 7 fold with earthworm activity sediment yield rates were generally higher in the treatments with earthworms than the controls however the variations of sediment rates with rain duration differed between the controls and the treatments with earthworms fig 4 for the rain intensity of 90 mm h 1 the sediment yield rates in the treatments with earthworms averaged 18 1 and 36 1 g m 2 min 1 for the 5 and 15 slopes 1 6 and 2 7 fold higher than those in the controls respectively fig 4a and b the sediment yield rates in the controls varied little during the rain for the cases of 90 mm h 1 while in earthworm treatments were dramatically increased at the early stage and then gradually decreased over time for the rain intensity of 120 mm h 1 the averaged sediment yield rates were 34 8 and 74 5 g m 2 min 1 in the treatments with earthworms for the 5 and 15 slopes 1 1 and 1 4 fold higher than the controls respectively fig 4c and d the sediment yield rates in the treatments with earthworms generally increased during the rain for the 5 slope fig 4c but for the 15 slope it rapidly decreased at the early stage and then tended to be stable fig 4d earthworm activity led to a negative change rate for cumulative runoff but a positive change rate for cumulative sediment fig 5 a higher change rate in cumulative runoff was obtained in the 5 than the 15 slope but no regular variation was observed between treatments with different rain intensities for the cumulative sediment the change rates were higher for a rain intensity of 90 mm h 1 than 120 mm h 1 and was higher for the 15 than the 5 slope the change rate in cumulative sediment was highest in the 90 mm h 1 15 slope treatment at 169 and lowest in the 120 mm h 1 5 slope treatment at only 3 1 4 discussion 4 1 effects of earthworm activity on runoff earthworms are reported beneficial to reduce water runoff because their burrowing activity increases infiltration and the casts act as a physical barrier to runoff shipitalo and le bayon 2004 our results confirmed the negative effects of earthworm activity on surface runoff earthworm activity not only delayed the runoff initiation time but also dramatically decreased runoff by 28 4 60 6 relative to the controls table 3 fig 5 these values were much close to but slightly lower than the results obtained by le bayon and binet 2001 in temperate maize cropland the effects of earthworm activity on runoff however depends on earthworm species intrinsic soil properties and external factors lamandé et al 2011 compared to epigeic and endogeic earthworms the burrowing activity of anecic earthworms contributes more to the formation of soil macropores francis and fraser 1998 shipitalo and le bayon 2004 lamandé et al 2011 macropores connected with the surface can function as preferential pathways for water moving deep into the profile bastardie et al 2002 chan 2004 bailey et al 2015 li et al 2019 the vertical burrows made by anecic species are also considered as semi permanent structures and therefore increase the hydraulic conductivity and water infiltration nuutinen and butt 2003 blouin et al 2013 the widely distributed anecic earthworm in the study area therefore is expected to contribute greatly to the reduction in runoff changes in roughness and structure stability of soil surface caused by earthworm activity is an important influential factor of runoff rough soil surfaces caused by soil fauna animals and tillage greatly reduce runoff rates wang et al 2017 li et al 2019 runoff rates on gentle tropical slopes decreased from approximately 350 to 50 l m 2 y 1 when the surface coverage of free macroaggregates by earthworms increased from 20 to nearly 100 jouquet et al 2008b in the current study intense earthworm activity increased surface roughness by depositing a great number of casts and clods to a depth of approximately 3 cm fig 1a which is conducive to lower the surface runoff rates besides soc and clay which are known as major binding agents for aggregation six et al 2004 pulleman et al 2005 increased under earthworm activity table 1 thus the negative correlation between clay content and cumulative runoff table 5 p 0 05 could imply the positive effect of earthworm surface casts on decreasing runoff however cast stability depends on the texture of the parent soil and casts generated from clay and loam soils are less water stable than the natural soil aggregates schrader and zhang 1997 our study was consistent with this finding table 2 as a consequence the runoff rates were lower at the moment of runoff initiation under earthworm activity due to the high surface roughness but increased rapidly at the early stage of the rain as unstable casts and soil clods dispersed by raindrops and decreased the roughness fig 1b and c and fig 3 as noted above we suggest anecic earthworms reduce water runoff mainly through structuring semi permanent vertical burrows that increase water infiltration on the slope under simulated rainfall conditions 4 2 effects of earthworm activity on soil erosion the function of earthworms on soil erosion has been widely recognized le bayon et al 2002 blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2013 however whether earthworms had a positive or negative effect on soil erosion obtains different results some studies indicated that earthworms could effectively reduce soil erosion due to the greatly decreased runoff and the water stable surface casts shuster et al 2002 jouquet et al 2012 in contrast other studies showed that surface casts might increase soil detachment during rainstorm events and long rainy periods le bayon et al 2002 the different erodibility of surface casts is one of the main reasons for the opposite earthworm impacts on soil erosion fresh casts of some temperate species are more vulnerable to rain and other disturbances than dry casts and thus are easily dispersed and contribute to soil loss mariani et al 2007 in our study earthworm activity was significant during the 15 days which can be found in fig 1 although a mass of casts at different ageing stages and clods made by earthworms on soil surface enhance the surface roughness they were easy to be broken by intense rainfall and became potential sources of particulate which increase sediment concentration in runoff water fig s1 therefore the increased sediment in our study is a consequence of the dispersed surface casts and detached soil clods being washed away by runoff waters consistent with our results le bayon and binet 2001 found that sediment transport on temperate sloped land was 2 3 fold higher in treatments covered by surface casts than without casts and fresh casts degraded at a rate of 2 8 casts m 2 in the first 5 min of rain similarly a study of tropical anecic species also found that surface casts started to collapse within 30 s jouquet et al 2013 similar to runoff the impact of earthworms on soil erosion is usually site specific blanchart et al 2004 jouquet et al 2012 aggravated soil erosion caused by earthworm activity is more likely to occur in the study area where has loose soil texture intense and frequent rain events in the summer leading to a disadvantage to the stabilization of aggregates huang and shao 2019 4 3 effects of rain intensity and slope rain intensity and slope are two predominant factors that influence the hydrological processes and erosion serrano muela et al 2015 especially on the loess plateau where has thousands of steep slopes and gullies huang and shao 2019 rain intensity mostly affects the amount of runoff soil detachment and sediment transport and slope mainly influences runoff and sediment transport zhang and wang 2017 rainfall is reported as the main agent of earthworm cast degradation and even casts with rather persistent structures can be locally dispersed by a storm decaëns 2000 surface casts are subjected to a considerable erosion process caused by rainfall at any time during their ageing process under field conditions mariani et al 2007 the study area often experienced heavy rainstorms in summer which may rapidly disintegrate the surface casts particularly the fresh casts and aggravate soil loss from slopes rainfall at the intensity of 90 and 120 mm h 1 both resulted in extreme degradation of surface casts in our experiment considering the cast erodibility as discussed above a high possibility that earthworms positively affect soil erosion is expected in the loess plateau area in the present work the slope gradient was found to be more influential than rain intensity on runoff volume and soil loss under earthworm activity runoff and sediment yield are directly affected by soil crust and rill development and the crust increases runoff discharge and decreased soil erosion carmi and berliner 2008 shi et al 2010 fang et al 2015 while under earthworm activity the formation of surface crust and rill development were greatly disturbed resulting in a much higher infiltration rate and thus less rainfall impact the dispersed cast and detached soil particulate during the rainfall were easier to be washed away by runoff water in steeper slopes this could explain the greater impacts of slope gradient than rain intensity nevertheless the response mechanisms of runoff and soil erosion to the interactions of earthworm activity rain intensity and slope gradient are complex a better understanding of the contribution of earthworm activity to soil erosion dynamics would require long term observations at the field scale 5 conclusion earthworm burrowing and casting activities have positive effects on delaying runoff initiation time and reducing the quantity and rate of runoff on the slope the low stability of fresh casts and soil clods on soil surface by frequent disturbance of earthworms contributed to severe soil erosion despite the great reduction in the magnitude of runoff the function of earthworms in reducing runoff was more obvious at lower slope gradient and in exacerbating soil erosion was more obvious at lower rain intensity and higher slope gradient in general slope gradient was more influential than rain intensity on runoff and soil erosion under earthworm activity the sediment rates were considerably higher when sedimentation was initiated but generally decreased with the disintegration of the surface casts during the rain soil aggregates with low water stability were mainly responsible for the increased soil loss under earthworm activity the stability of m guillelmi casts of different ages should thus be studied in the future to identify the mechanism of erosion caused by earthworms quantifying the effects of earthworm activity on the processes of runoff and soil

9818,subirrigation requires precise control of the water table level to provide adequate soil water content swc for promoting plant growth optimizing water table level management has been shown to improve soil aeration reduce n leaching and reduce risk of crop losses the objectives of this study were to i assess if water table level and n fertilizer rate impact potato growth root development plant n uptake or tuber yield and ii estimate the optimum water table level threshold that provides sufficient soil upward water flux to meet plant water requirements the study was conducted in 2013 and 2014 in hastings fl usa water table level was automatically controlled in three independent irrigation zones of 1 4 ha at 36 54 and 71 cm from the top of the hilled row termed as high hwt medium mwt and low lwt water table treatments respectively and swc measured at 22 cm depth was used as covariate to compare treatments a randomized complete block with three replications was used to evaluate potato cultivars atlantic and fl1867 under 0 112 224 and 336 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer within water table treatments marketable yield in 2013 was lower than 2014 owing to the high precipitation 421 mm during tuber bulking that led to high swc and tuber decay total and marketable tuber yields were maximized when n fertilizer rates ranged from 243 to 336 kg ha 1 the highest yield and proportion of large tubers occurred when swc at 22 cm ranged from 0 13 to 0 16 m3 m 3 the hwt significantly limited root length diameter and surface area compared to the lwt in 2014 variation of swc at 22 cm depth had little effect on tuber yield the hwt was not detrimental to tuber yield but rather it compounded the negative effect that high precipitation rate had on fluctuating swc in the root zone resulting in reduced yield and tuber quality optimal swc in the root zone can be achieved by adjusting the water table level and upward soil water flux throughout the season according to the crop evapotranspiration for each crop stage which reduces irrigation water requirements and minimizes the risks of soil water saturation and tuber yield losses keywords irrigation automation nitrogen seepage irrigation sandy soil soil water flux water table management 1 introduction the total world production of potatoes solanum tuberosum l in 2017 was around 388 million mg faostat 2019 the united states produces up to 22 4 million mg of potatoes annually achieving 3 7 billion in sales in 2014 np council 2019 the state of florida produces potatoes during winter and spring contributing up to half of the nation s spring crop florida cultivated 11 370 ha of potato in 2017 at a value of 124 8 million making the state an important supplier of freshly harvested potatoes from december to june at a time when growers received premium prices for potato in florida potato and other vegetable crops are grown on coarse texture soils predominantly characterized by uncoated sand particles with high hydraulic conductivity low soil organic matter som and low soil cation exchange capacity these soil characteristics combined provide a rapid infiltration of water and solutes through the upper soil layers soil survey staff 2014 stanley and toor 2010 the shallow water table in these production areas is due to the presence of an impervious clay layer generally below 60 100 cm of soil depth crop irrigation is facilitated by raising the shallow water table to just below the root zone a practice termed seepage irrigation or subirrigation smajstrla et al 2000 way 2007 there are approximately 323 000 ha of crop land suitable to subirrigation in florida dukes et al 2010 the manipulation of the water table below the soil surface creates an upward movement of water from an artificially maintained water table dukes et al 2010 groundwater from the aquifer is supplied to the field along open furrows spaced every 18 m via header pipe way 2007 the applied water permeates down through the soil until it reaches the impermeable soil layer or restricted soil horizon which depth varies from 1 to 3 m the water table is perched from the impermeable layer to approximately 30 55 cm below the soil surface for irrigation clark and stanley 1992 da silva et al 2018a the furrows also drain excess water from the field after rainfall events the furrows are connected to drainage ditches of 1 2 m in depth that surrounds the agricultural field the ditches are equipped with retention boards weir or dam like structure to hold and control the water back in the ditches along the edge of the field to control the table level way 2007 the drainage water is conveyed by gravity flow to a network of artificial drainage canals connected to the tributaries of large rivers in florida the unique challenges associated with subirrigation scheduling include providing sufficient and uniform distribution of soil moisture in the root zone across the field despite unpredictable rainfall events sato et al 2009 frequent soil moisture oscillations in the root zone are common in the spring potato season even small rainfall events can quickly increase the water table level jaber and shukla 2006 crop yield losses occur if water is not quickly removed from the field following flooding from rainfall events stanley and toor 2010 usda nrcs 2001 soil water saturation can limit root growth by inducing anoxic conditions ahmadi et al 2011 ferreira et al 2017 munoz arboleda et al 2006 stalham and allen 2004 furthermore there is a close relationship between irrigation management and n leaching from sandy soils under subirrigation sato et al 2009 as the water table level is raised n fertilizer applied to the root zone is solubilized and becomes available to plants when the water table level is lowered the solubilized n leaches below the root zone moves laterally by subsurface water flow and then is transported off site through the furrows and connected drainage ditches shukla et al 2010 maintaining a relatively very high water table level increases the loss of n to leaching hendricks and shukla 2011 by amplifying significant losses of mineral n during rain events guo et al 2006 sato et al 2009 sandy soils with a shallow water table are very susceptible to n leaching therefore n fertilizer rates higher than the crop requirement may be required in subirrigation simonne et al 2010 especially if n fertilizer application timing does not coincide with plant n uptake the objectives of this study were to i assess if the water table level and n fertilizer rate impact potato growth root development plant n uptake and tuber yield and ii estimate the optimum water table level threshold for subirrigation that provides sufficient soil upward water flux to meet potato plant water requirements throughout the season with the least irrigation water applied 2 materials and methods the study was conducted in spring of 2013 and 2014 at the university of florida hastings agricultural

layers the field was divided into four independent irrigation zones of 1 4 ha each the zones were separated using drainage ditches and controlled by boards placed at the southwest corner of each field so that independent water table levels could be applied in each zone the three western zones of this field were used in the study each zone consisted of 5 potato beds with 16 hilled potato rows about

low power 3 v batteries praxsoft orlando fl usa data was transmitted every 15 min to a computer receiver stored in a database and displayed in a private web based application based on the average water table level data from each irrigation zone the wsn controlled the independent irrigation application in each water table zone by opening and closing an irrigation solenoid valve located at the north end of each zone fig 1 irrigation events were independently triggered in each irrigation zone when the water table level reached 3 cm below the pre determined threshold irrigation events were terminated by the wsn irrigation controller when the water table level was above the threshold irrigation of the trials began at 20 and 42 days after planting dap in 2013 and 2014 respectively soil

camera and image acquisition system bartz technology corp carpinteria ca usa on 76 dap in both years and 104 and 90 dap in 2013 and 2014 respectively images were analyzed by hand tracing each root

2 8 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova using proc glm sas institute inc 2011 was conducted for the split plot design to evaluate the influence of n rate and cultivar within each of the three water table zones n rate was assigned as the main plot factor with cultivar as the sub plot factor random effects of block and the interaction between block and the main plot factor were also analyzed separate analyses were performed for each year regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between n rate and measured variables when there was a significant effect of n rate

each year using n rate cultivar and their interaction as main effects with the linear and quadratic effects of swc used as covariates 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall distribution water table level and soil volumetric moisture cumulative rainfall from pre plant fertilization to harvest was 455 and 395 mm in 2013 and 2014 respectively despite the similar cumulative volumes the rainfall distribution in each season had a different pattern the beginning of the 2013 season had fewer rain events and cumulative rainfall between pre plant fertilization and the tuber initiation stage was only 34 mm conversely for the same period in 2014 cumulative rainfall was 283 mm the lack of early season rainfall in 2013 required irrigation to start at 20 dap whereas in 2014 irrigation was initiated later at 40 dap after planting retention boards located at the southwest corners of each irrigation treatment fig 1 were kept lowered and no irrigation water was supplied during the early potato growth stage in both years during this period the water table level ranged from 80 to 100 cm below the top of the hilled row the elevation of the water table level to irrigate the crop during potato germination and sprout development stages is generally not required under favorable soil moisture conditions and more regular rainfall distribution in fact the maintenance of relatively low water table level is a strategy to prevent excessive soil moisture near the potato seed piece that could lead to seed rot in 2013 the period between tuber initiation and harvest was characterized by high precipitation mainly concentrated around the tuber bulking stage starting at 83 dap there was a large rainfall event of 244 mm within 3 days with 421 mm between tuber initiation stage 42 dap and harvest 102 dap fig 2a comparatively there was less rainfall during the same period in 2014 a total of 165 mm of rainfall occurred between tuber initiation 42 dap and harvest 98 dap and it was more evenly distributed through short rainfall events fig 2c distribution and intensity of rainfall events had a direct impact on the water table level soil moisture in the root zone and irrigation volume required to reach the target water table level of each irrigation zone throughout the crop seasons throughout the seasons there was a diurnal fluctuation in the water table level reaching a daily maximum just before dawn at around 5 00 a m each day after daybreak water losses from evapotranspiration increased to a rate faster than water table recharge and irrigation thereby lowering the water table level by approximately 15 cm reaching a minimum around 7 00 p m the swc in the rootzone measured at the 22 cm depth also fluctuated daily by 0 01 0 03 m m 3 fig 2b d despite a clear distinction in water table level across the three irrigation treatments during rain free periods the correspondent swc at 22 cm depth was not always directly proportional to the water table level for example during active periods of irrigation e g 79 85 dap in 2013 fig 2b the swc at mwt was in many instances similar to the hwt whereas during drainage periods the swc in the mwt was often similar to the lwt in both years the rapid influx of water from rainfall quickly increased the water table level in all water table treatments when rainfall was expected boards in each water table treatment were manually lowered to allow drainage of the field figs 1 and 2a c while each water table treatment was isolated by a drainage ditch north south direction each irrigation treatment drained into one common ditch at the south end of the field meaning there was interdependence of drainage between treatments this can be considered as a limitation of this study however this did not invalidate the comparison between different irrigation treatments and the potato plant response as it created a gradient of soil moisture among the water table level treatments throughout the tuber bulking and maturity stages the hwt treatment maintained swc 22 cm depth above soil field capacity fc 0 24 m3 m 3 for 26 days in 2013 and 17 days in 2014 while the treatments mwt and lwt had 14 and 10 days in 2013 and 8 and 4 days in 2014 respectively with swc fc the high swc at the 22 cm depth in hwt contributed to swc values above the air filled porosity afp in deeper soil depths data not shown as observed by ferreira et al 2017 which likely depleted the oxygen availability overall the lwt treatment had the highest potential for rainwater storage and a more rapid drainage than mwt and hwt for example on apr 14 2013 a rainfall event of 62 mm raised the water table level to 20 cm from the top of the potato row in all treatments fig 2a which resulted in a quick increase of swc fig 2b since the lwt had more available porous space for water storage the water table level and swc in the root zone decreased at a faster rate following rain events than in the hwt and mwt fig 2a b maintaining a high water table level increases risks of both nutrient leaching and hypoxic anoxic soil conditions as it reduces the drainable porosity of the soil which could result in rapid flooding during rain events jaber and shukla 2006 as seen during the tuber bulking stage in 2013 excess swc in the root zone or decreased air filled porosity has negative impacts on potato growth yield and tuber quality and is a contributing factor in n losses through leaching runoff and denitrification 3 2 irrigation water application as function of water table level thresholds irrigation was programmed to automatically initiate an irrigation event when the water table reached threshold depths of 36 54 and 71 cm below the top of the potato row for hwt mwt and lwt respectively irrigation events spanned from 20 to 82 dap in 2013 total irrigation supplied in 2013 was 346 194 and 94 mm for the hwt mwt and lwt respectively little to no irrigation was applied during the tuber maturation stage and plant senescence irrigation was ceased even earlier in 2013 due to a large rain event during tuber bulking 82 84 dap and excessive swc conditions irrigation events spanned from 40 to 89 dap in 2014 in 2014 the overall level of the retention boards was adjusted to 10 cm lower than in 2013 to reduce the overall swc in the middle of the potato beds therefore the volume of irrigation required to maintain the threshold water table target was considerably higher than in 2013 total irrigation water supplied in 2014 was 1160 764 and 420 mm to the hwt lwt and mwt respectively the volume of irrigation used in the lwt was 45 52 less than mwt and 64 73 less than the hwt which means 1000 3960 m3 ha 1 of irrigation water savings for the lwt relatively to the other treatments the impact of the irrigation treatments on soil water flux aboveground and root growth and yield is presented and discussed below 3 3 determination of water table level target based on soil water flux and crop water demand the relationship between water table level and upward soil water flux q at 22 cm soil depth was determined for each irrigation treatment fig 3 the water table level response to q was similar among the irrigation treatments thus a single hyperbolic model was fit the q at 22 cm soil depth was significantly correlated to the water table level the model describes an increase of q at 22 cm depth from 0 15 to 0 50 cm h 1 when the water table level was raised from 80 to 60 cm depth from the top of the potato row when the water table level was maintained between 60 and 40 cm depth the correspondent q ranged from 0 50 to 1 18 cm h 1 while the water table level maintained between 40 and 30 cm depth provided a q ranging from 1 18 to 2 06 cm h 1 when the water table level was shallower than 30 cm depth the actual swc at the 22 cm soil depth was reported to be above 0 30 m3 m 3 creating physical limitations to root growth due to restrictions in soil aeration ferreira et al 2017 active periods of irrigation were characterized by different water table levels for each irrigation treatment consequently resulting in different values of q and air filled porosity at the root zone for example during the potato tuber bulking stage between apr 21 and 29 2013 the average depth of water table level was 38 6 55 2 and 64 1 cm for hwt mwt and lwt respectively while the corresponding q was 1 26 0 62 and 0 41 cm h 1 respectively in 2014 between apr 20 and 30 the average depth of water table level was 48 0 58 3 and 67 2 cm for hwt mwt and lwt respectively and the correspondent q was 0 82 0 54 and 0 37 cm h 1 the relationship between the water table level and q can be used to determine the water table level in which crop water demand and q values match da silva et al 2018a thus a precise irrigation scheduling can be achieved by adjusting the water table level during the different crop stages by matching average etc and q table 2 presents the average eto and etc for each crop stage and the respective average water table level target for 2013 and 2014 estimated from the hyperbolic model fig 3 the daily etc and kc curves adjusted for potato and the estimated seasonal water table level target are presented in fig 4 the water table level target can then be adjusted throughout the season in order to match crop water demand and q during sprout development the etc was relatively low compared to other crop stages and the water table level target can be maintained around 90 cm below the top of the hilled potato row as the potato crop entered vegetative growth there was a rapid increase of the aboveground biomass characterized by a linear increase in etc fig 4 a b that would require the water table level to be progressively raised tuber initiation is a very critical stage when soil water stress can compromise crop production miller and martin 1987 therefore it is imperative to adjust the water table to a level that provides ideal swc to plant and root growth ferreira et al 2017 between 22 and 50 dap the daily etc ranged from 0 8 to 4 2 mm in 2013 and 1 5 3 3 mm in 2014 average water table level target depth during the vegetative growth and tuber initiation stages is raised to 83 and 71 cm respectively crop water demand peaked at the maturity stage with a kc of 1 10 followed by a slight decline during the maturity stage fig 4 this period was also characterized by a significant increase in the eto the daily etc for this period ranged from 1 3 to 4 3 mm in 2013 and 1 7 and 5 3 mm in 2014 the water table level target is then slightly raised to a 68 cm depth to supply the etc for tuber bulking and maturity stages table 2 there are practical benefits of controlling the water table level as near as possible to the target level determined in this study it provides a reference point to achieve a balance between excessive and deficit soil moisture conditions to potato plants throughout the season it will increase the soil water capacity to retain rainfall thus reducing the requirement of irrigation while resulting in excess soil water in the root zone for only a limited time period and it will indirectly control excessive drainage and nutrient discharge off site fouss et al 2007 3 4 potato root development in response to water table level potato roots can grow 60 80 cm deep stalham and allen 2004 subirrigation is associated with a large oscillation of water table level throughout the growing season causing shallower rooting with the highest root density in the top 24 cm munoz arboleda et al 2006 potato is a soil moisture sensitive crop excess swc and high water table levels restrict soil aeration and root growth leading to a higher concentration of roots near the soil surface in contrast roots tend to grow deeper in water limited environments stalham and allen 2004 in the present study root growth was measured in the hwt and lwt treatments in both years table 3 the interaction of water table treatments with depth and sampling date had significant impacts on root length diameter and surface area with these traits being significantly greater under lwt than hwt at 76 dap in both seasons and 90 dap in 2014 tables 3 and s 2 the hwt treatment promoted an overall reduction of potato root length in the order of 37 63 compared to the lwt potato root diameter was also reduced by 27 63 under hwt in the 20 30 cm soil depth root length and diameter were significantly higher under lwt than hwt except at 104 dap in 2013 root imaging conducted at the beginning of the maturity stage 90 dap in 2014 and near harvest 104 dap in 2013 revealed lower values of total root length surface area and diameter compared to those previously reported at 76 dap which can be attributed to root senescence all rooting parameters were higher in lwt compared to hwt at the 20 30 cm soil depth with 65 68 of roots in hwt being concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil depth in 2013 this proportion was even higher in 2014 with up to 93 of the total root length found in the top 20 cm of soil this indicates a change in root growth and morphology related to water table level treatment and soil water content air filled porosity in the soil profile deeper and more prolific rooting as seen in the lwt may lead to increased plant resilience to adverse stress conditions along with enhanced root nutrient and water uptake stalham and allen 2004 while decreasing soil n losses from the field 3 5 soil mineral n before the first n fertilizer application average soil mineral n no3 n nh4 n concentration among all water table treatments was 14 and 2 mg kg 1 in the 0 20 cm depth layer in 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 5 the first application of 56 kg ha 1 of n occurred pre plant npre pl 32 and 30 days before planting in 2013 and 2014 respectively soil n concentration was higher by an average of 78 mg kg 1 in treated plots n1 and n2 as compared to unfertilized plots n3 and n4 in 2013 table 1 this increase in soil n remained at plant emergence across all water table treatments fig 5a c soil n concentration in 2014 was considerably lower than in 2013 at planting and emergence presumably due to higher rainfall leading to soil n loss through leaching and runoff fig 5d f the difference in rainfall between years resulted in lower soil n availability in the 0 20 cm soil layer the npre pl application in 2014 increased soil n concentration by an average of 14 mg kg 1 at planting compared to unfertilized plots the application effect remained at plant emergence with 8 mg kg 1 higher n the rainfall pattern in 2014 was more representative of typical weather conditions in northeastern florida and the susceptibility to losses of early applied n has been previously reported munoz arboleda et al 2006 zotarelli et al 2015 2014 for example n fertilizer uptake efficiency fnue of potato using 15n labeled n fertilizer from the pre plant application was just 10 this is significantly low compared to the 62 fnue from n applications at plant emergence and tuber initiation rens et al 2016 however a higher tuber yield was obtained when n fertilizer was applied at pre plant indicating the importance of some soil n availability in the first 20 dap for securing higher potato yields rens et al 2018 the second application of n fertilizer occurred at plant emergence 20 dap in 2013 and 2014 bringing the cumulative n fertilizer rates to 0 56 140 and 224 kg ha 1 table 1 soil n in the 0 20 cm depth layer at tuber initiation 42 and 40 dap in 2013 and 2014 respectively proportionally reflected the four n rates applied in both years with significant differences between n rates in both years fig 5 there was a peak in soil n at the tuber initiation stage for n rates of 112 224 and 336 kg ha 1 in both years soil n at tuber initiation in unfertilized plots averaged 35 and 9 mg kg 1 attributed to som mineralization regardless of water table treatment or year soil n increased linearly in response to increasing nemer fertilizer rates within all three water table treatments the highest measured soil n concentration ranged from 235 to 336 mg kg 1 in 2013 and 168 256 mg kg 1 in 2014 for the highest n fertilizer rate the final n fertilizer application occurred at tuber initiation 42 dap in both years bringing the total n rates to 0 112 224 and 336 kg ha 1 of n soil n decreased between tuber initiation and tuber bulking in both years 69 and 64 dap in 2013 and 2014 respectively despite the addition of n fertilizer fig 5 reductions of soil n is attributed to plant n uptake fig 6 possible movement of no3 n to soil layers below the sampled layer gaseous loss through n denitrification and environmental losses from runoff or leaching guo et al 2006 sato et al 2009 at tuber bulking in 2013 69 dap soil n concentration in the hwt treatment was similar across all n fertilizer rates fig 5a averaging 48 mg kg 1 however soil n concentration was increased across n fertilizer rates in the mwt and lwt fig 5b c soil n concentrations increased from 4 to 107 mg kg 1 in the mwt treatment and from 9 to 88 mg kg 1 in the lwt treatment when n fertilizer rate increased from 0 to 336 kg ha 1 in 2013 in 2014 the magnitude of response in soil n concentration from the applied n fertilizer rates was less than in 2013 soil n concentration at the tuber bulking stage in 2014 was lower than in 2013 at the same point in the season fig 5a c as n fertilizer rate increased from 0 to 336 kg ha 1 soil n concentration also increased from 2 to 39 mg kg 1 in the hwt treatment fig 5a and from 2 to 33 mg kg 1 in the lwt fig 5c soil n at harvest was relatively low for all water table treatments and n fertilizer rates averaging 20 and 9 mg kg 1 in 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 5 similar to the concentration during field preparation before the npre pl fertilizer application soil n at harvest averaged 32 12 and 14 mg kg 1 in the hwt mwt and lwt treatments respectively in 2013 residual soil n concentration was similar between n rates in the hwt and mwt however soil n concentration under lwt increased linearly in response to increasing n fertilizer rates in 2014 soil n averaged 12 8 and 7 mg kg 1 in the hwt mwt and lwt treatments respectively hendricks and shukla 2011 examined soil n leaching from fertilizer applied on tomatoes cultivated on plastic mulched beds under different water table heights authors concluded that a lower water table depth reduces nitrate leaching by increasing the travel distance to the water table and increasing rainfall water storage within the rootzone leaching and runoff were not measured in the present study still higher water table level and swc in the rootzone resulted in no differences in soil n concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer among n fertilizer rates due to the small influence the water table level had in the potato hills overall occasional rainfall events had a greater impact on the soil n available in the 0 20 cm soil layer than the water table level treatments the impact of season and water table treatment on soil n was quantified using the integrated area below the soil n curve from each n rate application fig 5 the concentration of soil n in the 0 20 cm soil layer was 2 6 times greater in 2013 than 2014 attributed to increased rainfall pattern higher overall water table level and higher soil water content in 2014 fig 2 water table management had little impact on soil n at 0 20 cm depth as compared to rainfall distribution as there were no differences of integrated area below the soil n curves among water table treatments within each season matching rate and timing of n fertilizer application to crop uptake curve seems to have a much greater impact on keeping the nutrients in the root zone for plant uptake da silva et al 2018b rens et al 2016 than water table management strategies adopted in this study 3 6 plant nitrogen accumulation and apparent nitrogen recovery anr the effects of n fertilizer rate and potato cultivar on plant n accumulation and anr were examined within each of the hwt mwt and lwt treatments there were no differences in plant n accumulation between cultivars in either year therefore cultivar data were merged and analyzed together 3 6 1 effect of water table treatments potato plant n accumulation averaged 29 kg ha 1 across irrigation treatments at tuber initiation in 2013 42 dap the n accumulation increased proportionally to n fertilizer rate as the season progressed fig 6 plant n accumulation increased in response to n fertilizer rates at tuber bulking 74 dap maximizing at 109 122 and 115 kg ha 1 in the hwt mwt and lwt treatments respectively with no significant differences among treatments the next plant sampling was at 89 dap just after a large rain event that led to a rapid increase in the water table level in all irrigation treatments fig 2a owing to the already high water table level in the hwt drainage of this treatment and reduction of swc was relatively slower than in the mwt and lwt leading to tuber decay premature senescence reduced plant growth and low n uptake plant n accumulation in the hwt at 74 dap was often higher than at the end of the tuber bulking stage 89 dap or at harvest 96 dap because a large quantity of tubers decayed to a level where they were not retrievable from the soil later in the season fig 6 by the time of harvest plant n accumulation ranged from 58 to 175 kg ha 1 in the mwt and 58 146 kg ha 1 in the lwt treatment across n fertilizer rates the overall anr was significantly lower in hwt 13 1 than in mwt and lwt 44 5 and 30 4 respectively plant n accumulation was quadratically correlated with swc at harvest 96 dap in 2013 using an analysis of covariance with swc at 22 cm from all three water table treatments combined plant n accumulation maximized when swc was 0 13 0 16 cm cm 3 and decreased when swc increased to 0 26 cm cm 3 fig 7a b in contrast water table level and swc were more effectively managed under the increased rainfall pattern of 2014 plant n accumulation increased proportionally to n fertilizer rate to a different extent in each of the water table treatments during tuber initiation and tuber bulking in 2014 fig 6d f at harvest plant n accumulation increased in response to n fertilizer rates in each water table level treatment ranging from 21 to 143 kg ha 1 in the hwt 19 177 kg ha 1 in the mwt and 25 148 kg ha 1 in the lwt treatment fig 6 average anr was 42 4 with no difference in overall anr across water table level treatments there was no clear relationship between average swc at 22 cm and plant n accumulation in 2014 fig 7c d in contrast to 2013 this indicates that in 2014 a year with no adverse weather conditions the maintenance of a higher water table level did not directly impact plant n uptake despite the fact root development in the 20 40 cm soil layer was reduced under hwt treatment compared to lwt treatments table 3 3 6 2 effect of n fertilizer rates there was little to no difference in plant n accumulation in response to n fertilizer rate throughout most of the 2013 season in the hwt treatment except for 74 and 89 dap in contrast n accumulation increased at least two fold in the mwt and lwt treatments as n fertilizer rate increased fig 6a c the limited root growth in hwt most notably at the 20 30 cm layer could have resulted in the reduced n uptake under 2013 season conditions therefore high swc could be a plausible contributing factor for the relatively low plant n accumulation the anr across n rates were 30 3 34 9 and 22 8 for the n fertilizer rates of 112 224 and 336 kg ha 1 in 2013 respectively and 48 2 38 9 and 39 9 in 2014 respectively n fertilizer rate of 112 kg ha 1 resulted in the lowest n plant uptake and there were no differences in plant n uptake between 224 and 336 kg ha 1 n fertilizer rates in 2013 regardless of water table treatment at tuber bulking in 2014 n fertilizer rates of 224 and 336 kg ha 1 had a significant effect on plant n accumulation in the lwt fig 6f and maturation stage in hwt and mwt fig 6d e the lack of differences in plant n accumulation between 224 and 336 kg ha 1 of n in 2013 was directly related to the greater availability of soil n in the 0 20 cm depth layer fig 5a c in that year soil n was above 100 mg kg 1 for both n fertilizer rates while in 2014 due to the rainfall events early in the season most of the npre pl was not available in the 0 20 cm depth layer at emergence which amplified the plant n uptake response from the nemerg fertilizer rates 3 7 total and marketable tuber yield effects of n fertilizer rate and potato cultivar on total and marketable yield were examined within each of the hwt mwt and lwt treatments table s 1 in both years total yield was similar between cultivars but there was a main effect of n fertilizer rate in each year for all water table treatments except by the hwt in 2013 in 2013 hwt had the lowest total yield averaging 12 4 mg ha 1 as a result of tuber decay total yield was similar between all n fertilizer rates within the hwt zone in the mwt total yield increased quadratically in response to n rate maximizing at 39 9 mg ha 1 at a n fertilizer rate of 246 kg ha 1 in the lwt zone total yield also increased quadratically in response to n rate maximizing at 32 4 mg ha 1 at 336 kg ha 1 of n table 4 in 2014 total yield was similar between cultivars but n fertilizer rate had a main effect on total yield within each water table level treatment rainfall in 2014 was lower and more evenly distributed than 2013 therefore the hwt had a much lower rate of tuber decay in 2014 compared to 2013 in the hwt total yield increased quadratically in response to n rate maximizing at 32 7 mg ha 1 when n fertilizer rate was 300 kg ha 1 in the mwt total yield increased quadratically maximizing at 36 2 mg ha 1 at an n rate of 336 kg ha 1 and in the lwt total yield also increased quadratically maximizing at 36 9 mg ha 1 at 336 kg ha 1 of n in contrast similar studies in growing conditions with limited rainfall had a lack of response of total tuber yield to n fertilizer rates rens et al 2018 zotarelli et al 2015 2014 in those studies n fertilizer rates were lower ranging from 95 to 125 kg ha 1 of n applied at plant emergence compared to 168 kg ha 1 of n applied at the same application timing this resulted in higher soil n that matched seasonal potato n uptake marketable yield ranged from 0 3 to 34 0 mg ha 1 in 2013 and 4 2 38 3 mg ha 1 in 2014 table 4 in 2013 cultivar had a main effect on marketable yield under hwt and mwt treatments and n fertilizer rate had a main effect on marketable yield in the mwt and lwt in the hwt marketable yield averaged 2 3 mg ha 1 and was 0 6 mg ha 1 higher for the fl1867 cultivar than atlantic in the mwt marketable yield was also higher for fl1867 by 2 9 mg ha 1 there was no difference in marketable yield between cultivars in the lwt treatment marketable yield also increased quadratically in response to n rate in the mwt maximizing at 29 1 mg ha 1 when the n fertilizer rate was 243 kg ha 1 in the lwt marketable yield was 0 5 mg ha 1 higher for cultivar fl1867 compared to the atlantic and increased linearly in response to increasing n fertilizer rates maximizing at 20 3 mg ha 1 at the highest n fertilizer rate at 336 kg ha 1 in 2014 marketable yield was similar between cultivars but n fertilizer rate had a main effect on marketable yield in each of the water table treatments in the hwt marketable yield increased quadratically from 7 3 mg ha 1 in unfertilized plots up to 31 0 mg ha 1 when n fertilizer rate was 297 kg ha 1 tuber marketable yield in the mwt and lwt also increased quadratically from 5 6 to 34 5 mg ha 1 and from 7 8 to 35 7 mg ha 1 respectively when the n fertilizer rate increased from 0 to 336 kg ha 1 there was a significant difference in marketable tuber yield between n rates of 224 and 336 kg ha 1 in the mwt and lwt with an average increase of 5 8 mg ha 1 under the higher n rate applied higher total and marketable yields in the mwt and lwt treatments were likely due to increased root growth expected as soil aeration conditions were improved ferreira et al 2017 when the water table was maintained lower than the hwt table 3 leading to higher plant n uptake after 50 dap fig 6 increasing swc negatively impacted marketable yield in 2013 but not 2014 according to the analysis of covariance using swc data at 22 cm from all three water table treatments merged fig 8 in 2013 for each n fertilizer rate and cultivar combination marketable yield was maximized when soil moisture at 22 cm averaged between 0 13 and 0 18 m m 3 fig 8a b when the average swc was maintained above 0 18 m3 m 3 there was a quadratic decline of marketable yield regardless of n fertilizer rate or cultivar in 2014 there was no correlation between average swc at 22 cm and marketable tuber yield across n fertilizer rates and cultivars fig 8c d the only exception was for the cultivar fl1867 under 336 kg ha 1 of n fig 8d in which soil moisture between 0 16 and 0 20 m m 3 resulted in a peak of marketable tuber yield above 35 mg ha 1 p 0 001 r2 0 720 the maintenance of a high water table level itself was not detrimental to tuber yield rather maintaining a high water table level results in limited drainage capabilities which can compound the negative effect of high rainfall on fluctuating swc resulting in reduced tuber yield this is supported by the response of tuber yield as a function of irrigation treatment in the two years likely due to contrasting weather conditions satchithanantham et al 2012 reported similar results in manitoba canada where a deeper water table increased potato yield only in a wet season with no relationship in a drier year in addition seasons with lower precipitation like the earlier part of 2013 resulted in higher soil n concentration in the rootzone causing greater potential for tuber yield under lower n fertilizer rates e g 224 kg ha 1 of n conversely in years with more regular distribution of rainfall like 2014 higher n fertilizer rates might be required to maximize tuber yield under subirrigation simonne et al 2010 the fnue reached 18 when n fertilizer was applied at planting or a few days before planting da silva et al 2018b compared to a nfue of 11 when n fertilizer was applied 30 days before planting rens et al 2016 therefore optimizing n fertilizer rate and timing to match potato plant uptake in combination with a water table level control strategy that minimizes flooding risks and provides soil water flux to support plant evapotranspiration are key for the successful fertilizer irrigation management of sandy soils under subirrigation 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to examine the effect that water table level and n fertilizer rate have on plant growth n uptake root development and yield of potato crop under subirrigation the two years of this study were characterized by very different rainfall patterns the first year had a dry early season until 60 dap followed by high rainfall until harvest while the second year had a more even distribution of rainfall throughout the season rainfall distribution throughout the potato season influenced soil n availability and crop response to the water table treatments total and marketable tuber yields were maximized when n fertilizer rate ranged from 243 to 336 kg ha 1 with the first n application of 56 kg ha 1 at 30 days before planting the highest tuber yield and proportion of large tubers occurred when swc at 22 cm depth ranged from 0 13 to 0 16 m3 m 3 most tuber quality defects were minimized when swc averaged 0 13 0 18 m3 m 3 in the second season despite the fact that maintaining a hwt treatment limited root growth below 20 cm soil depth the variation in swc at 22 cm depth across water table treatments had little effect on tuber yield this highlights that management of a high water table level was not detrimental to tuber yield but rather that it can compound the negative effect that high precipitation rate has on fluctuating swc in the root zone resulting in lower yield and tuber quality optimum swc at 22 cm depth can be achieved by adjusting the water table level and upward soil water flux throughout the season according to the etc for each potato crop stage which will minimize the risk of soil water saturation conditions in the root zone and subsequent tuber decay from unpredictable rain events due to inadequate soil aeration in the root zone furthermore by adjusting the water table level throughout the season the volume of irrigation water required can be significantly reduced in the present study the volume of irrigation used in the lwt was 45 52 less than mwt and 64 73 less than the hwt regionally the potential water conservation by using water table settings similarly to the lwt treatment can reach 11 3 45 0 million m3 season 1 without negatively

9818,subirrigation requires precise control of the water table level to provide adequate soil water content swc for promoting plant growth optimizing water table level management has been shown to improve soil aeration reduce n leaching and reduce risk of crop losses the objectives of this study were to i assess if water table level and n fertilizer rate impact potato growth root development plant n uptake or tuber yield and ii estimate the optimum water table level threshold that provides sufficient soil upward water flux to meet plant water requirements the study was conducted in 2013 and 2014 in hastings fl usa water table level was automatically controlled in three independent irrigation zones of 1 4 ha at 36 54 and 71 cm from the top of the hilled row termed as high hwt medium mwt and low lwt water table treatments respectively and swc measured at 22 cm depth was used as covariate to compare treatments a randomized complete block with three replications was used to evaluate potato cultivars atlantic and fl1867 under 0 112 224 and 336 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer within water table treatments marketable yield in 2013 was lower than 2014 owing to the high precipitation 421 mm during tuber bulking that led to high swc and tuber decay total and marketable tuber yields were maximized when n fertilizer rates ranged from 243 to 336 kg ha 1 the highest yield and proportion of large tubers occurred when swc at 22 cm ranged from 0 13 to 0 16 m3 m 3 the hwt significantly limited root length diameter and surface area compared to the lwt in 2014 variation of swc at 22 cm depth had little effect on tuber yield the hwt was not detrimental to tuber yield but rather it compounded the negative effect that high precipitation rate had on fluctuating swc in the root zone resulting in reduced yield and tuber quality optimal swc in the root zone can be achieved by adjusting the water table level and upward soil water flux throughout the season according to the crop evapotranspiration for each crop stage which reduces irrigation water requirements and minimizes the risks of soil water saturation and tuber yield losses keywords irrigation automation nitrogen

states produces up to 22 4 million mg of potatoes annually achieving 3 7 billion in sales in 2014 np council 2019 the state of florida produces potatoes during winter and spring contributing up to half of the nation s spring crop florida cultivated 11 370 ha of potato in 2017 at a value of 124 8 million making the state an important supplier of freshly harvested potatoes from december to june at a time when growers received premium prices for potato in florida potato and other vegetable crops are grown on coarse texture soils predominantly characterized by uncoated sand particles with high hydraulic conductivity low soil organic matter som and low soil cation exchange capacity these soil characteristics combined provide a rapid infiltration of water and solutes through the upper soil layers soil survey staff 2014 stanley and toor 2010 the shallow water table in these production areas is due to the presence of an impervious clay layer generally below 60 100 cm of soil depth crop irrigation is facilitated by raising the shallow water table to just below the root zone a practice termed seepage irrigation or subirrigation smajstrla et al 2000 way 2007 there are approximately 323 000 ha of crop land suitable to subirrigation in florida dukes et al 2010 the manipulation of the water table below the soil surface creates an upward movement of water from an artificially maintained water table dukes et al 2010 groundwater from the aquifer is supplied to the field along open furrows spaced every 18 m via header pipe way 2007 the applied water permeates down through the soil until it reaches the impermeable soil layer or restricted soil horizon which depth varies from 1 to 3 m the water table is perched from the impermeable layer to approximately 30 55 cm below the soil surface for irrigation clark and stanley 1992 da silva et al 2018a the furrows also drain excess water from the field after rainfall events the furrows are connected to drainage ditches of 1 2 m in depth that surrounds the agricultural field the ditches are equipped with retention boards weir or dam like structure to hold and control the water back in the ditches along the edge of the field to control the table level way 2007 the drainage water is conveyed by gravity flow to a network of artificial drainage canals connected to the tributaries of large rivers in florida the unique challenges associated with subirrigation scheduling include providing sufficient and uniform distribution of soil moisture in the root zone across the field despite unpredictable rainfall events sato et al 2009 frequent soil moisture oscillations in the root zone are common in the spring potato season even small rainfall events can quickly increase the water table level jaber and shukla 2006 crop yield losses occur if water is not quickly removed from the field following flooding from rainfall events stanley and toor 2010 usda nrcs 2001 soil water saturation can limit root growth by inducing anoxic conditions ahmadi et al 2011 ferreira et al 2017 munoz arboleda et al 2006 stalham and allen 2004 furthermore there is a close relationship between irrigation management and n leaching from sandy soils under subirrigation sato et al 2009 as the water table level is raised n fertilizer applied to the root zone is solubilized and becomes available to plants when the water table level is lowered the solubilized n leaches below the root zone moves laterally by subsurface water flow and then is transported off site through the furrows and connected drainage ditches shukla et al 2010 maintaining a relatively very high water table level increases the loss of n to leaching hendricks and shukla 2011 by amplifying significant losses of mineral n during rain events guo et al 2006 sato et al 2009 sandy soils with a shallow water table are very susceptible to n leaching therefore n fertilizer rates higher than the crop requirement may be required in subirrigation simonne et al 2010 especially if n fertilizer application timing does not coincide with plant n uptake the objectives of this study were to i assess if the water table level and n fertilizer rate impact potato growth root development plant n uptake and tuber yield and ii estimate the optimum water table level threshold for subirrigation that provides sufficient soil upward water flux to meet potato plant water requirements throughout the season with the least irrigation water applied 2 materials and methods the study was conducted in spring of 2013 and 2014 at the university of florida hastings agricultural extension center 29 41 45 n 81 26 36 w 9 m above sea level in hastings fl usa the area of the study comprised 5 8 ha isolated from nearby agricultural areas using drainage ditches on all borders fig 1

layers the field was divided into four independent irrigation zones of 1 4 ha each the zones were separated using drainage ditches and controlled by boards placed at the southwest corner of each field so that independent water table levels could be applied in each zone the three western zones of this field were used in the study each zone consisted of 5 potato beds with 16 hilled potato rows about 30 cm height each separated by irrigation furrows potato beds were 18 m wide by 130 m long potato rows were oriented north to south 2 1 irrigation management and water table level treatments the water table level treatments were applied in each irrigation zone the average water table level thresholds were 36 54 and 71 cm depth from the top of the hilled potato row termed high hwt medium mwt and low lwt water table respectively the water table levels were measured by piezometers pdcr 1830 series general electric windsor ct usa installed in the center of each water table zone in observational wells of 5 cm internal diameter and 1 8 m long fig 1 each piezometer was coupled to a wireless sensor node wsn connected to a web based decision support system software pdcr performance data collection and reporting praxsoft orlando fl usa to control the irrigation the three wsns provided signal conditioning data logging point to point point to multi point and ad hoc communications using low power 3 v batteries praxsoft orlando fl usa data was transmitted every 15 min to a computer receiver stored in a database and displayed in a private web based application based on the average water table level data from each irrigation zone the wsn controlled the independent irrigation application in each water table zone by opening and closing an irrigation solenoid valve located at the north end of each zone fig 1 irrigation events were independently triggered in each irrigation zone when the water table level reached 3 cm below the pre determined threshold irrigation events were terminated by the wsn irrigation controller when the water table level was above the threshold irrigation of the trials began at 20 and 42 days after planting dap in 2013 and 2014 respectively soil

2 8 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova using proc glm sas institute inc 2011 was conducted for the split plot design to evaluate the influence of n rate and cultivar within each of the three water table zones n rate was assigned as the main plot factor with cultivar as the sub plot factor random effects of block and the interaction between block and the main plot factor were also analyzed separate analyses were performed for each year regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between n rate and measured variables when there was a significant effect of n rate in the anova a second analysis was performed to determine the effect of swc on plant n accumulation tuber yield and tuber quality using data from all three water table treatments combined an analysis of covariance ancova using proc glm sas institute inc 2011 was performed using average swc at the 22 cm soil depth from each of the 9 blocks used as a covariate individual ancovas were performed for each year using n rate cultivar and their interaction as main effects with the linear and quadratic effects of swc used as covariates 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall distribution water table level and soil volumetric moisture cumulative rainfall from pre plant fertilization to harvest was 455 and 395 mm in 2013 and 2014 respectively despite the similar cumulative volumes the rainfall distribution in each season had a different pattern the beginning of the 2013 season had fewer rain events and cumulative rainfall between pre plant fertilization and the tuber initiation stage was only 34 mm conversely for the same period in 2014 cumulative rainfall was 283 mm the lack of early season rainfall in 2013 required irrigation to start at 20 dap whereas in 2014 irrigation was initiated later at 40 dap after planting retention boards located at the southwest corners of each irrigation treatment fig 1 were kept lowered and no irrigation water was supplied during the early potato growth stage in both years during this period the water table level ranged from 80 to 100 cm below the top of the hilled row the elevation of the water table level to irrigate the crop during potato germination and sprout development stages is generally not required under favorable soil moisture conditions and more regular rainfall distribution in fact the maintenance of relatively low water table level is a strategy to prevent excessive soil moisture near the potato seed piece that could lead to seed rot in 2013 the period between tuber initiation and harvest was characterized by high precipitation mainly concentrated around the tuber bulking stage starting at 83 dap there was a large rainfall event of 244 mm within 3 days with 421 mm between tuber initiation stage 42 dap and harvest 102 dap fig 2a comparatively there was less rainfall during the same period in 2014 a total of 165 mm of rainfall occurred between tuber initiation 42 dap and harvest 98 dap and it was more evenly distributed through short rainfall events fig 2c distribution and intensity of rainfall events had a direct impact on the water table level soil moisture in the root zone and irrigation volume required to reach the target water table level of each irrigation zone throughout the crop seasons throughout the seasons there was a diurnal fluctuation in the water table level reaching a daily maximum just before dawn at around 5 00 a m each day after daybreak water losses from evapotranspiration increased to a rate faster than water table recharge and irrigation thereby lowering the water table level by approximately 15 cm reaching a minimum around 7 00 p m the swc in the rootzone measured at the 22 cm depth also fluctuated daily by 0 01 0 03 m m 3 fig 2b d despite a clear distinction in water table level across the three irrigation treatments during rain free periods the correspondent swc at 22 cm depth was not always directly proportional to the water table level for example during active periods of irrigation e g 79 85 dap in 2013 fig 2b the swc at mwt was in many instances similar to the hwt whereas during drainage periods the swc in the mwt was often similar to the lwt in both years the rapid influx of water from rainfall quickly increased the water table level in all water table treatments when rainfall was expected boards in each water table treatment were manually lowered to allow drainage of the field figs 1 and 2a c while each water table treatment was isolated by a drainage ditch north south direction each irrigation treatment drained into one common ditch at the south end of the field meaning there was interdependence of drainage between treatments this can be considered as a limitation of this study however this did not invalidate the comparison between different irrigation treatments and the potato plant response as it created a gradient of soil moisture among the water table level treatments throughout the tuber bulking and maturity stages the hwt treatment maintained swc 22 cm depth above soil field capacity fc 0 24 m3 m 3 for 26 days in 2013 and 17 days in 2014 while the treatments mwt and lwt had 14 and 10 days in 2013 and 8 and 4 days in 2014 respectively with swc fc the high swc at the 22 cm depth in hwt contributed to swc values above the air filled porosity afp in deeper soil depths data not shown as observed by ferreira et al 2017 which likely depleted the oxygen availability overall the lwt treatment had the highest potential for rainwater storage and a more rapid drainage than mwt and hwt for example on apr 14 2013 a rainfall event of 62 mm raised the water table level to 20 cm from the top of the potato row in all treatments fig 2a which resulted in a quick increase of swc fig 2b since the lwt had more available porous space for water storage the water table level and swc in the root zone decreased at a faster rate following rain events than in the hwt and mwt fig 2a b maintaining a high water table level increases risks of both nutrient leaching and hypoxic anoxic soil conditions as it reduces the drainable porosity of the soil which could result in rapid flooding during rain events jaber and shukla 2006 as seen during the tuber bulking stage in 2013 excess swc in the root zone or decreased air filled porosity has negative impacts on potato growth yield and tuber quality and is a contributing factor in n losses through leaching runoff and denitrification 3 2 irrigation water application as function of water table level thresholds irrigation was programmed to automatically initiate an irrigation event when the water table reached threshold depths of 36 54 and 71 cm below the top of the potato row for hwt mwt and lwt respectively irrigation events spanned from 20 to 82 dap in 2013 total irrigation supplied in 2013 was 346 194 and 94 mm for the hwt mwt and lwt respectively little to no irrigation was applied during the tuber maturation stage and plant senescence irrigation was ceased even earlier in 2013 due to a large rain event during tuber bulking 82 84 dap and excessive swc conditions irrigation events spanned from 40 to 89 dap in 2014 in 2014 the overall level of the retention boards was adjusted to 10 cm lower than in 2013 to reduce the overall swc in the middle of the potato beds therefore the volume of irrigation required to maintain the threshold water table target was considerably higher than in 2013 total irrigation water supplied in 2014 was 1160 764 and 420 mm to the hwt lwt and mwt respectively the volume of irrigation used in the lwt was 45 52 less than mwt and 64 73 less than the hwt which means 1000 3960 m3 ha 1 of irrigation water savings for the lwt relatively to the other treatments the impact of the irrigation treatments on soil water flux aboveground and root growth and yield is presented and discussed below 3 3 determination of water table level target based on soil water flux and crop water demand the relationship between water table level and upward soil water flux q at 22 cm soil depth was determined for each irrigation treatment fig 3 the water table level response to q was similar among the irrigation treatments thus a single hyperbolic model was fit the q at 22 cm soil depth was significantly correlated to the water table level the model describes an increase of q at 22 cm depth from 0 15 to 0 50 cm h 1 when the water table level was raised from 80 to 60 cm depth from the top of the potato row when the water table level was maintained between 60 and 40 cm depth the correspondent q ranged from 0 50 to 1 18 cm h 1 while the water table level maintained between 40 and 30 cm depth provided a q ranging from 1 18 to 2 06 cm h 1 when the water table level was shallower than 30 cm depth the actual swc at the 22 cm soil depth was reported to be above 0 30 m3 m 3 creating physical limitations to root growth due to restrictions in soil aeration ferreira et al 2017 active periods of irrigation were characterized by different water table levels for each irrigation treatment consequently resulting in different values of q and air filled porosity at the root zone for example during the potato tuber bulking stage between apr 21 and 29 2013 the average depth of water table level was 38 6 55 2 and 64 1 cm for hwt mwt and lwt respectively while the corresponding q was 1 26 0 62 and 0 41 cm h 1 respectively in 2014 between apr 20 and 30 the average depth of water table level was 48 0 58 3 and 67 2 cm for hwt mwt and lwt respectively and the correspondent q was 0 82 0 54 and 0 37 cm h 1 the relationship between the water table level and q can be used to determine the water table level in which crop water demand and q values match da silva et al 2018a thus a precise irrigation scheduling can be achieved by adjusting the water table level during the different crop stages by matching average etc and q table 2 presents the average eto and etc for each crop stage and the respective average water table level target for 2013 and 2014 estimated from the hyperbolic model fig 3 the daily etc and kc curves adjusted for potato and the estimated seasonal water table level target are presented in fig 4 the water table level target can then be adjusted throughout the season in order to match crop water demand and q during sprout development the etc was relatively low compared to other crop stages and the water table level target can be maintained around 90 cm below the top of the hilled potato row as the potato crop entered vegetative growth there was a rapid increase of the aboveground biomass characterized by a linear increase in etc fig 4 a b that would require the water table level to be progressively raised tuber initiation is a very critical stage when soil water stress can compromise crop production miller and martin 1987 therefore it is imperative to adjust the water table to a level that provides ideal swc to plant and root growth ferreira et al 2017 between 22 and 50 dap the daily etc ranged from 0 8 to 4 2 mm in 2013 and 1 5 3 3 mm in 2014 average water table level target depth during the vegetative growth and tuber initiation stages is raised to 83 and 71 cm respectively crop water demand peaked at the maturity stage with a kc of 1 10 followed by a slight decline during the maturity stage fig 4 this period was also characterized by a significant increase in the eto the daily etc for this period ranged from 1 3 to 4 3 mm in 2013 and 1 7 and 5 3 mm in 2014 the water table level target is then slightly raised to a 68 cm depth to supply the etc for tuber bulking and maturity stages table 2 there are practical benefits of controlling the water table level as near as possible to the target level determined in this study it provides a reference point to achieve a balance between excessive and deficit soil moisture conditions to potato plants throughout the season it will increase the soil water capacity to retain rainfall thus reducing the requirement of irrigation while resulting in excess soil water in the root zone for only a limited time period and it will indirectly control excessive drainage and nutrient discharge off site fouss et al 2007 3 4 potato root development in response to water table level potato roots can grow 60 80 cm deep stalham and allen 2004 subirrigation is associated with a large oscillation of water table level throughout the growing season causing shallower rooting with the highest root density in the top 24 cm munoz arboleda et al 2006 potato is a soil moisture sensitive crop excess swc and high water table levels restrict soil aeration and root growth leading to a higher concentration of roots near the soil surface in contrast roots tend to grow deeper in water limited environments stalham and allen 2004 in the present study root growth was measured in the hwt and lwt treatments in both years table 3 the interaction of water table treatments with depth and sampling date had significant impacts on root length diameter and surface area with these traits being significantly greater under lwt than hwt at 76 dap in both seasons and 90 dap in 2014 tables 3 and s 2 the hwt treatment promoted an overall reduction of potato root length in the order of 37 63 compared to the lwt potato root diameter was also reduced by 27 63 under hwt in the 20 30 cm soil depth root length and diameter were significantly higher under lwt than hwt except at 104 dap in 2013 root imaging conducted at the beginning of the maturity stage 90 dap in 2014 and near harvest 104 dap in 2013 revealed lower values of total root length surface area and diameter compared to those previously reported at 76 dap which can be attributed to root senescence all rooting parameters were higher in lwt compared to hwt at the 20 30 cm soil depth with 65 68 of roots in hwt being concentrated in the 0 20 cm soil depth in 2013 this proportion was even higher in 2014 with up to 93 of the total root length found in the top 20 cm of soil this indicates a change in root growth and morphology related to water table level treatment and soil water content air filled porosity in the soil profile deeper and more prolific rooting as seen in the lwt may lead to increased plant resilience to adverse stress conditions along with enhanced root nutrient and water uptake stalham and allen 2004 while decreasing soil n losses from the field 3 5 soil mineral n before the first n fertilizer application average soil mineral n no3 n nh4 n concentration among all water table treatments was 14 and 2 mg kg 1 in the 0 20 cm depth layer in 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 5 the first application of 56 kg ha 1 of n occurred pre plant npre pl 32 and 30 days before planting in 2013 and 2014 respectively soil n concentration was higher by an average of 78 mg kg 1 in treated plots n1 and n2 as compared to unfertilized plots n3 and n4 in 2013 table 1 this increase in soil n remained at plant emergence across all water table treatments fig 5a c soil n concentration in 2014 was considerably lower than in 2013 at planting and emergence presumably due to higher rainfall leading to soil n loss through leaching and runoff fig 5d f the difference in rainfall between years resulted in lower soil n availability in the 0 20 cm soil layer the npre pl application in 2014 increased soil n concentration by an average of 14 mg kg 1 at planting compared to unfertilized plots the application effect remained at plant emergence with 8 mg kg 1 higher n the rainfall pattern in 2014 was more representative of typical weather conditions in northeastern florida and the susceptibility to losses of early applied n has been previously reported munoz arboleda et al 2006 zotarelli et al 2015 2014 for example n fertilizer uptake efficiency fnue of potato using 15n labeled n fertilizer from the pre plant application was just 10 this is significantly low compared to the 62 fnue from n applications at plant emergence and tuber initiation rens et al 2016 however a higher tuber yield was obtained when n fertilizer was applied at pre plant indicating the importance of some soil n availability in the first 20 dap for securing higher potato yields rens et al 2018 the second application of n fertilizer occurred at plant emergence 20 dap in 2013 and 2014 bringing the cumulative n fertilizer rates to 0 56 140 and 224 kg ha 1 table 1 soil n in the 0 20 cm depth layer at tuber initiation 42 and 40 dap in 2013 and 2014 respectively proportionally reflected the four n rates applied in both years with significant differences between n rates in both years fig 5 there was a peak in soil n at the tuber initiation stage for n rates of 112 224 and 336 kg ha 1 in both years soil n at tuber initiation in unfertilized plots averaged 35 and 9 mg kg 1 attributed to som mineralization regardless of water table treatment or year soil n increased linearly in response to increasing nemer fertilizer rates within all three water table treatments the highest measured soil n concentration ranged from 235 to 336 mg kg 1 in 2013 and 168 256 mg kg 1 in 2014 for the highest n fertilizer rate the final n fertilizer application occurred at tuber initiation 42 dap in both years bringing the total n rates to 0 112 224 and 336 kg ha 1 of n soil n decreased between tuber initiation and tuber bulking in both years 69 and 64 dap in 2013 and 2014 respectively despite the addition of n fertilizer fig 5 reductions of soil n is attributed to plant n uptake fig 6 possible movement of no3 n to soil layers below the sampled layer gaseous loss through n denitrification and environmental losses from runoff or leaching guo et al 2006 sato et al 2009 at tuber bulking in 2013 69 dap soil n concentration in the hwt treatment was similar across all n fertilizer rates fig 5a averaging 48 mg kg 1 however soil n concentration was increased across n fertilizer rates in the mwt and lwt fig 5b c soil n concentrations increased from 4 to 107 mg kg 1 in the mwt treatment and from 9 to 88 mg kg 1 in the lwt treatment when n fertilizer rate increased from 0 to 336 kg ha 1 in 2013 in 2014 the magnitude of response in soil n concentration from the applied n fertilizer rates was less than in 2013 soil n concentration at the tuber bulking stage in 2014 was lower than in 2013 at the same point in the season fig 5a c as n fertilizer rate increased from 0 to 336 kg ha 1 soil n concentration also increased from 2 to 39 mg kg 1 in the hwt treatment fig 5a and from 2 to 33 mg kg 1 in the lwt fig 5c soil n at harvest was relatively low for all water table treatments and n fertilizer rates averaging 20 and 9 mg kg 1 in 2013 and 2014 respectively fig 5 similar to the concentration during field preparation before the npre pl fertilizer application soil n at harvest averaged 32 12 and 14 mg kg 1 in the hwt mwt and lwt treatments respectively in 2013 residual soil n concentration was similar between n rates in the hwt and mwt however soil n concentration under lwt increased linearly in response to increasing n fertilizer rates in 2014 soil n averaged 12 8 and 7 mg kg 1 in the hwt mwt and lwt treatments respectively hendricks and shukla 2011 examined soil n leaching from fertilizer applied on tomatoes cultivated on plastic mulched beds under different water table heights authors concluded that a lower water table depth reduces nitrate leaching by increasing the travel distance to the water table and increasing rainfall water storage within the rootzone leaching and runoff were not measured in the present study still higher water table level and swc in the rootzone resulted in no differences in soil n concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer among n fertilizer rates due to the small influence the water table level had in the potato hills overall occasional rainfall events had a greater impact on the soil n available in the 0 20 cm soil layer than the water table level treatments the impact of season and water table treatment on soil n was quantified using the integrated area below the soil n curve from each n rate application fig 5 the concentration of soil n in the 0 20 cm soil layer was 2 6 times greater in 2013 than 2014 attributed to increased rainfall pattern higher overall water table level and higher soil water content in 2014 fig 2 water table management had little impact on soil n at 0 20 cm depth as compared to rainfall distribution as there were no differences of integrated area below the soil n curves among water table treatments within each season matching rate and timing of n fertilizer application to crop uptake curve seems to have a much greater impact on keeping the nutrients in the root zone for plant uptake da silva et al 2018b rens et al 2016 than water table management strategies adopted in this study 3 6 plant nitrogen accumulation and apparent nitrogen recovery anr the effects of n fertilizer rate and potato cultivar on plant n accumulation and anr were examined within each of the hwt mwt and lwt treatments there were no differences in plant n accumulation between cultivars in either year therefore cultivar data were merged and analyzed together 3 6 1 effect of water table treatments potato plant n accumulation averaged 29 kg ha 1 across irrigation treatments at tuber initiation in 2013 42 dap the n accumulation increased proportionally to n fertilizer rate as the season progressed fig 6 plant n accumulation increased in response to n fertilizer rates at tuber bulking 74 dap maximizing at 109 122 and 115 kg ha 1 in the hwt mwt and lwt treatments respectively with no significant differences among treatments the next plant sampling was at 89 dap just after a large rain event that led to a rapid increase in the water table level in all irrigation treatments fig 2a owing to the already high water table level in the hwt drainage of this treatment and reduction of swc was relatively slower than in the mwt and lwt leading to tuber decay premature senescence reduced plant growth and low n uptake plant n accumulation in the hwt at 74 dap was often higher than at the end of the tuber bulking stage 89 dap or at harvest 96 dap because a large quantity of tubers decayed to a level where they were not retrievable from the soil later in the season fig 6 by the time of harvest plant n accumulation ranged from 58 to 175 kg ha 1 in the mwt and 58 146 kg ha 1 in the lwt treatment across n fertilizer rates the overall anr was significantly lower in hwt 13 1 than in mwt and lwt 44 5 and 30 4 respectively plant n accumulation was quadratically correlated with swc at harvest 96 dap in 2013 using an analysis of covariance with swc at 22 cm from all three water table treatments combined plant n accumulation maximized when swc was 0 13 0 16 cm cm 3 and decreased when swc increased to 0 26 cm cm 3 fig 7a b in contrast water table level and swc were more effectively managed under the increased rainfall pattern of 2014 plant n accumulation increased proportionally to n fertilizer rate to a different extent in each of the water table treatments during tuber initiation and tuber bulking in 2014 fig 6d f at harvest plant n accumulation increased in response to n fertilizer rates in each water table level treatment ranging from 21 to 143 kg ha 1 in the hwt 19 177 kg ha 1 in the mwt and 25 148 kg ha 1 in the lwt treatment fig 6 average anr was 42 4 with no difference in overall anr across water table level treatments there was no clear relationship between average swc at 22 cm and plant n accumulation in 2014 fig 7c d in contrast to 2013 this indicates that in 2014 a year with no adverse weather conditions the maintenance of a higher water table level did not directly impact plant n uptake despite the fact root development in the 20 40 cm soil layer was reduced under hwt treatment compared to lwt treatments table 3 3 6 2 effect of n fertilizer rates there was little to no difference in plant n accumulation in response to n fertilizer rate throughout most of the 2013 season in the hwt treatment except for 74 and 89 dap in contrast n accumulation increased at least two fold in the mwt and lwt treatments as n fertilizer rate increased fig 6a c the limited root growth in hwt most notably at the 20 30 cm layer could have resulted in the reduced n uptake under 2013 season conditions therefore high swc could be a plausible contributing factor for the relatively low plant n accumulation the anr across n rates were 30 3 34 9 and 22 8 for the n fertilizer rates of 112 224 and 336 kg ha 1 in 2013 respectively and 48 2 38 9 and 39 9 in 2014 respectively n fertilizer rate of 112 kg ha 1 resulted in the lowest n plant uptake and there were no differences in plant n uptake between 224 and 336 kg ha 1 n fertilizer rates in 2013 regardless of water table treatment at tuber bulking in 2014 n fertilizer rates of 224 and 336 kg ha 1 had a significant effect on plant n accumulation in the lwt fig 6f and maturation stage in hwt and mwt fig 6d e the lack of differences in plant n accumulation between 224 and 336 kg ha 1 of n in 2013 was directly related to the greater availability of soil n in the 0 20 cm depth layer fig 5a c in that year soil n was above 100 mg kg 1 for both n fertilizer rates while in 2014 due to the rainfall events early in the season most of the npre pl was not available in the 0 20 cm depth layer at emergence which amplified the plant n uptake response from the nemerg fertilizer rates 3 7 total and marketable tuber yield effects of n fertilizer rate and potato cultivar on total and marketable yield were examined within each of the hwt mwt and lwt treatments table s 1 in both years total yield was similar between cultivars but there was a main effect of n fertilizer rate in each year for all water table treatments except by the hwt in 2013 in 2013 hwt had the lowest total yield averaging 12 4 mg ha 1 as a result of tuber decay total yield was similar between all n fertilizer rates within the hwt zone in the mwt total yield increased quadratically in response to n rate maximizing at 39 9 mg ha 1 at a n fertilizer rate of 246 kg ha 1 in the lwt zone total yield also increased quadratically in response to n rate maximizing at 32 4 mg ha 1 at 336 kg ha 1 of n table 4 in 2014 total yield was similar between cultivars but n fertilizer rate had a main effect on total yield within each water table level treatment rainfall in 2014 was lower and more evenly distributed than 2013 therefore the hwt had a much lower rate of tuber decay in 2014 compared to 2013 in the hwt total yield increased quadratically in response to n rate maximizing at 32 7 mg ha 1 when n fertilizer rate was 300 kg ha 1 in the mwt total yield increased quadratically maximizing at 36 2 mg ha 1 at an n rate of 336 kg ha 1 and in the lwt total yield also increased quadratically maximizing at 36 9 mg ha 1 at 336 kg ha 1 of n in contrast similar studies in growing conditions with limited rainfall had a lack of response of total tuber yield to n fertilizer rates rens et al 2018 zotarelli et al 2015 2014 in those studies n fertilizer rates were lower ranging from 95 to 125 kg ha 1 of n applied at plant emergence compared to 168 kg ha 1 of n applied at the same application timing this resulted in higher soil n that matched seasonal potato n uptake marketable yield ranged from 0 3 to 34 0 mg ha 1 in 2013 and 4 2 38 3 mg ha 1 in 2014 table 4 in 2013 cultivar had a main effect on marketable yield under hwt and mwt treatments and n fertilizer rate had a main effect on marketable yield in the mwt and lwt in the hwt marketable yield averaged 2 3 mg ha 1 and was 0 6 mg ha 1 higher for the fl1867 cultivar than atlantic in the mwt marketable yield was also higher for fl1867 by 2 9 mg ha 1 there was no difference in marketable yield between cultivars in the lwt treatment marketable yield also increased quadratically in response to n rate in the mwt maximizing at 29 1 mg ha 1 when the n fertilizer rate was 243 kg ha 1 in the lwt marketable yield was 0 5 mg ha 1 higher for cultivar fl1867 compared to the atlantic and increased linearly in response to increasing n fertilizer rates maximizing at 20 3 mg ha 1 at the highest n fertilizer rate at 336 kg ha 1 in 2014 marketable yield was similar between cultivars but n fertilizer rate had a main effect on marketable yield in each of the water table treatments in the hwt marketable yield increased quadratically from 7 3 mg ha 1 in unfertilized plots up to 31 0 mg ha 1 when n fertilizer rate was 297 kg ha 1 tuber marketable yield in the mwt and lwt also increased quadratically from 5 6 to 34 5 mg ha 1 and from 7 8 to 35 7 mg ha 1 respectively when the n fertilizer rate increased from 0 to 336 kg ha 1 there was a significant difference in marketable tuber yield between n rates of 224 and 336 kg ha 1 in the mwt and lwt with an average increase of 5 8 mg ha 1 under the higher n rate applied higher total and marketable yields in the mwt and lwt treatments were likely due to increased root growth expected as soil aeration conditions were improved ferreira et al 2017 when the water table was maintained lower than the hwt table 3 leading to higher plant n uptake after 50 dap fig 6 increasing swc negatively impacted marketable yield in 2013 but not 2014 according to the analysis of covariance using swc data at 22 cm from all three water table treatments merged fig 8 in 2013 for each n fertilizer rate and cultivar combination marketable yield was maximized when soil moisture at 22 cm averaged between 0 13 and 0 18 m m 3 fig 8a b when the average swc was maintained above 0 18 m3 m 3 there was a quadratic decline of marketable yield regardless of n fertilizer rate or cultivar in 2014 there was no correlation between average swc at 22 cm and marketable tuber yield across n fertilizer rates and cultivars fig 8c d the only exception was for the cultivar fl1867 under 336 kg ha 1 of n fig 8d in which soil moisture between 0 16 and 0 20 m m 3 resulted in a peak of marketable tuber yield above 35 mg ha 1 p 0 001 r2 0 720 the maintenance of a high water table level itself was not detrimental to tuber yield rather maintaining a high water table level results in limited drainage capabilities which can compound the negative effect of high rainfall on fluctuating swc resulting in reduced tuber yield this is supported by the response of tuber yield as a function of irrigation treatment in the two years likely due to contrasting weather conditions satchithanantham et al 2012 reported similar results in manitoba canada where a deeper water table increased potato yield only in a wet season with no relationship in a drier year in addition seasons with lower precipitation like the earlier part of 2013 resulted in higher soil n concentration in the rootzone causing greater potential for tuber yield under lower n fertilizer rates e g 224 kg ha 1 of n conversely in years with more regular distribution of rainfall like 2014 higher n fertilizer rates might be required to maximize tuber yield under subirrigation simonne et al 2010 the fnue reached 18 when n fertilizer was applied at planting or a few days before planting da silva et al 2018b compared to a nfue of 11 when n fertilizer was applied 30 days before planting rens et al 2016 therefore optimizing n fertilizer rate and timing to match potato plant uptake in combination with a water table level control strategy that minimizes flooding risks and provides soil water flux to support plant evapotranspiration are key for the successful fertilizer irrigation management of sandy soils under subirrigation 4 conclusions the objective of this study was to examine the effect that water table level and n fertilizer rate have on plant growth n uptake root development and yield of potato crop under subirrigation the two years of this study were characterized by very different rainfall patterns the first year had a dry early season until 60 dap followed by high rainfall until harvest while the second year had a more even distribution of rainfall throughout the season rainfall distribution throughout the potato season influenced soil n availability and crop response to the water table treatments total and marketable tuber yields were maximized when n fertilizer rate ranged from 243 to 336 kg ha 1 with the first n application of 56 kg ha 1 at 30 days before planting the highest tuber yield and proportion of large tubers occurred when swc at 22 cm depth ranged from 0 13 to 0 16 m3 m 3 most tuber quality defects were minimized when swc averaged 0 13 0 18 m3 m 3 in the second season despite the fact that maintaining a hwt treatment limited root growth below 20 cm soil depth the variation in swc at 22 cm depth across water table treatments had little effect on tuber yield this highlights that management of a high water table level was not detrimental to tuber yield but rather that it can compound the negative effect that high precipitation rate has on fluctuating swc in the root zone resulting in lower yield and tuber quality optimum swc at 22 cm depth can be achieved by adjusting the water table level and upward soil water flux throughout the season according to the etc for each potato crop stage which will minimize the risk of soil water saturation conditions in the root zone and subsequent tuber decay from unpredictable rain events due to inadequate soil aeration in the root zone furthermore by adjusting the water table level throughout the season the volume of irrigation water required can be significantly reduced in the present study the volume of irrigation used in the lwt was 45 52 less than mwt and 64 73 less than the hwt regionally the potential water conservation by using water table settings similarly to the lwt treatment can reach 11 3 45 0 million m3 season 1 without negatively

implications for policymakers and extension agencies keywords intention adoption theory of planned behavior soil and water conservation practices 1 introduction soil and water erosion is one of the leading causes of land degradation which has emerged as a serious global threat iran is located in the arid and semiarid zone of the world zarghani et al 2013 and it suffers from severe soil erosion khajavi et al 2015 roozitalab 1990 soil erosion brings about both on site and off site detrimental impacts in the short and long run majoro et al 2020 sileshi et al 2019 boardman et al 2019 2006 erkossa et al 2018 boardman and poesen 2006 lal 2001 soil erosion is either caused by natural agents or induced by human activities issaka and ashraf 2017 human activities play a decisive role in soil erosion type and extent wang et al 2003 small scale farmers as residents and beneficiaries of the natural resources in developing countries play a crucial role in resource conservation bayat et al 2011 it is therefore necessary for policymakers stakeholders and officials of sustainable agriculture and natural resources management to identify their conservation behaviors depending on country or region there are a series of conservation technologies to mitigate soil and water erosion based on the literature minimum tillage contour plowing contour cropping alley cropping trash lines cover crops manure composting grass buffer strips retention ditches agronomic practices agroforestry water harvesting options such as tied ridges and pond construction mulching bench terraces conservation farming integrated nutrient management crop rotation intercropping fallowing floodwalls and dams dredging and weeding of irrigation canals leveling and terracing sloppy farmlands are of sound measures for soil and water conservation swc kagoya et al 2018 ashoori et al 2016 turinawe et al 2015 mugonola et al 2013 wauters et al 2010 many studies have been conducted to elicit factors affecting the adoption of swc technologies belachew et al 2020 iyilade et al 2020 mekuriaw et al 2018 asfaw and neka 2017 de graaff et al 2008 however the adoption rate remains low and undesirable there is no clear evidence why farmers choose to follow an agricultural technology ulrich schad et al 2017 in addition previous studies have failed to provide a comprehensive understanding of farmers decision making process zeweld et al 2017 feola et al 2015 this might be due to the lack of a sound theoretical basis for the inclusion of socio psychological issues in the analysis of the decision making daxini et al 2019 borges and oude lansink 2016 if agricultural policymakers are to develop policy initiatives based on research findings they should seek methodologies that are theoretically appropriate quantitative repeatable and applicable at a large scale beedell and rehman 2000 when considering these aspects the impact of socio economic variables tends to lose its explanatory power poppenborg and koellner 2013 therefore there is an increasing tendency towards incorporating socio psychological theoretical frameworks to better understand farmers decision making process and use these insights to develop better policy initiatives daxini et al 2019 adnan et al 2017 floress et al 2017 the theory of planned behavior tpb ajzen 1991 is a well known socio psychological framework that gained growing attention especially in human resources studies armitage and conner 2001 fielding et al 2005 and more recently to explain farmers environmental behavior govindharaj et al 2021 tama et al 2021 damalas 2021 bagheri et al 2021a 2021b 2019 daxini et al 2019 adnan et al 2017 understanding farmers intentions and behavior towards the adoption of swc practices has paramount importance in protecting soil erosion and conserving water resources thereby avoiding land degradation beedell and rehman 2000 fielding et al 2008 wauters et al 2010 however there is little knowledge about farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices few studies have already examined farmers intentions and actual adoption towards adopting swc practices wauters et al 2010 and no study in iran has ever explored it by the tpb theoretical framework the present study therefore aimed to investigate the intended and actual adoption of swc practices in heris county in east azarbayjan province iran several studies have applied farm management models to explain farmers decision making in adopting new farming technologies such models are applicable when the innovation is easy to adopt and there are clear economic advantages and no intervening considerations sinden and king 1990 although farmers are interested in profit maximizing cost benefit models cannot fully capture the complexity of their behavior bagheri et al 2016 flett et al 2004 lynne et al 1988 in the case of the adoption of swc practices due to the involvement of environmental and social considerations a cost benefit analysis can provide answers to adoption but it does not take all related costs and benefits into account it is the reason why farmers may not adopt a technology even though the economic evidence suggests they should and why they adopt an swc practice even when economic prospects are not clear wauters et al 2010 therefore to achieve the objective of this study the tpb was employed to model small scale farmers intended and actual behavior the results will be helpful to draw the attention of agricultural policymakers towards socio psychological factors behind farmers decisions to adopt swc practices which are beyond economic only objectives several theories were presented to explain people s intentions and behavior diffusion of innovation theory doi social cognitive theory sct theory of reasoned action tra theory of planned behavior tpb and technology acceptance model tam are of well known behavioral theories the doi rogers 1962 was developed to explain how an innovation diffuses through a social system the theory divides people into five adoption groups i e innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards and exerts that people s characteristics is important to the adoption of an innovation the sct bandura 1989 claims that learning occurs in a social context with a dynamic interaction of behavior environment and individual like doi the theory considers the importance of social context in which people exhibit the behavior and their previous experiences that influence them to perform the behavior the tam was developed to explain the adoption of information based technologies based on the tam two attitudinal components of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are key determinants of acceptance and use of an information based technology while a number of studies showed the ability of tam to explain the variance in usage intentions and actual adoption jokar et al 2017 conflicting reports were presented as to its impact on intentions davis 1985 1993 venkatesh and davis 2000 venkatesh et al 2003 the tra states that behavior is a function of attitudes subjective norms and behavioral intentions fishbein and ajzen 1975 and intention is in turn a function of subjective norms and attitudes ajzen 1991 later included the construct of the perceived behavioral control in the tra and modified it as tpb the tpb posits that people s decision to engage in a particular behavior at a specific place is driven by their intentions which are determined by three constructs i e attitude subjective norm and perceived behavioral control pbc ajzen 1991 attitude refers to a positive or negative assessment of a specific behavior which consists of behavioral beliefs and an assessment of the implications of the behavior wang et al 2018 the more positive the attitudes the stronger the intention to perform a particular behavior adnan et al 2017 according to ajzen 1991 subjective norms refer to the perceived social pressure on an individual to exhibit or not to exhibit a particular behavior bagheri et al 2019 it implies that individuals behave under the influence of trusted people who are important to them and wish them to behave in a specific manner wang et al 2018 it also positively affects people s intentions chen and tung 2014 pbc refers to the perceived ease or difficulty of displaying a behavior under the individual s voluntary control fielding et al 2008 it consists of perceived difficulty and perceived control in that the latter has a slight impact on the intention it also impacts behavior directly or indirectly through behavioral intention bagheri et al 2019 behavioral intention refers to the extent to which an individual tries to perform a particular behavior and implies the readiness of people to perform a behavior fishbein and ajzen 2011 it is connected to the determinants more strongly than actual adoption so it can be predicted more readily adnan et al 2017 the intention is an immediate determinant of behavior ajzen 1991 moral norms as an extended construct of the tpb refer to the sense of displaying a particular moral behavior that makes individuals findings dependent on their rules or responsibility ajzen 1991 arvola et al 2008 defined moral norms as rules of morality that people have to follow moral norms differ from subjective norms while subjective norms are related to external social pressure moral norms are differentiated by the internalized moral values adnan et al 2017 they are moral principles or values that are prompted by rewards or self guilty punishments and significantly increase the understanding of people s intentions bagheri et al 2019 kaiser and scheuthle 2003 based on the conceptual framework and fig 1 the hypotheses of the study are proposed as follows h1 attitudes influence behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices h2 moral norms influence behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices h3 subjective norms influence behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices h4 pbc influences behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices h5 pbc influences the actual adoption of swc practices h6 behavioral intentions influence the actual adoption of swc practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices was examined in heris county in eastern azarbayjan province iran fig 2 the county latitude 38 24n longitude 47 22 e has an area of 2377 6 km2 about 70 of which is plain and the remaining 30 is mountainous the lowest and highest points of the county are 1500 and 3143 m above sea level respectively heris county has a cold steppe climate in the hills and a mediterranean climate in the lowland area generally it has cold and frosty winters and mild summers with min and max temperatures of 25 c and 35 c in winter and summer respectively the average annual precipitation of the county is 351 mm of which 87 mm often falls in autumn 90 mm in winter 173 mm in spring and 1 mm in summer the county accounts for about 2 3 of the total area of the province since it is located in the foothills of the bozghush sabolaghdagh aghdagh and ghoshadagh mountains and has 70 of the plain area with fertile soils the county has a high potential for agricultural and animal production in addition to autumn rainfalls the melting of winter snows and a part of water flowing from natural springs the talkhehroud river which originates from the heights of sabalan qoshadagh aniakhli aghdagh bozghush and the northern slopes of sahand is the primary source of water supply in the region the other vital water resources in the region are the heris zarnaq ojanchay mesil minegh khalaj and nimroor rivers annually the region hosts 7000 nomadic families engaged in animal rearing in the foothills and rangelands the farming system of the region is subsistence semi traditional and semi mechanized the water and soil resources are mostly exploited for a combination of crop animal production most croplands of the county are devoted to wheat and barley fodder grasses legumes summer crops onions and potatoes are the next important crops respectively this county has two districts markazi and khajeh six rural districts dehestans and five urban areas namely heris bakhshayesh zarnagh kelvanegh and khajeh 2 2 sampling instrument and data collection all farmers in the talkhehroud basin of heris county n 7636 constituted the research statistical population the region consists of six rural districts dehestans including 92 villages and six towns mpo 2015 the sample size was determined to be 220 farmers using cochran s 1977 sampling formula at the 95 confidence level the multistage random sampling method with the proportional assignment was employed for data collection so three villages or towns were randomly selected from each rural district for the rural district of western bedustan four villages were selected because of its larger size compared to the other rural districts a total of 16 villages and three towns were selected and 10 12 farmers from each village or town were randomly interviewed for data collection the questionnaires were filled out through face to face interviews at farmers homes or on the farm before data collection farmers were briefly informed about the objectives of the study and only volunteer farmers were interviewed the standard questionnaire of tpb was used as the data collection instrument in which necessary modifications were made based on the research objectives in addition to socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents the instrument consisted of tpb constructs i e attitudes towards swc 11 items subjective norms on swc 6 items perceived behavioral control on swc 6 items behavioral intentions 10 items and actual behaviors 12 items towards the application of swc practices an extended construct namely moral norms on swc practices 6 items was added to the tpb model table 2 the statements of the tpb constructs were formed by a literature review and consultation with university staff experts of agricultural science and natural resource especially experts in soil and water conservation and field visits to see swc practices used by farmers tpb constructs were examined on a five point likert scale from completely disagree 1 to fully agree 5 and vice versa for reverse items for the construct of actual adoption the items were examined from never 1 to always 5 a group of experts including university staff and agricultural and natural resources experts confirmed the content validity of the instrument a pilot study was conducted with a sample of 30 farmers from the outside of the sample villages for two weeks in may 2019 to pretest the instrument cronbach s alpha formula 1 was calculated to determine the reliability of the questionnaire the alpha values above 0 70 indicate acceptable reliability nunnally 1978 the alpha values obtained for all constructs in the pilot study were above 0 7 reflecting the high reliability of the questionnaire the field survey with the final draft of the questionnaire was conducted during july october in 2019 data were collected in the first three months and the last month was devoted to field visits to see how many practices were applied over the studied cropping year and to compare the intended and actual adoption of the studied swc practices for this purpose the participants were listed and asked to participate in the field visit stage 1 cronbach s alpha α k c v k 1 c k the number of items c the average of all covariance between items v the average variance of each item 2 3 data analysis data were coded standardized and analyzed in three stages matlab software was used to normalize the data in the first stage then the spss v 22 package was used for initial analysis including frequencies percentages mean scores and standard deviations sd the nonparametric wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to measure how many respondents have put their intention into practice and adopted the intended swc practices in their farms pearson correlation analysis was used to examine correlation between constructs of the tpb model finally partial least squares for structural equation modeling smart pls sem a widely used software in human resource research bagheri et al 2021b wu 2010 was used to test the research hypotheses sem is used to test complex relationships between observed and latent variables as well as relationships between several latent variables constructs are the latent variables that are estimated by some observed variables dijkstra and henseler 2015 it applies principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression to examine the path model s partial regression relationships to maximize the variance explained and minimize the error terms of the endogenous constructs hair et al 2017 2019 cronbach s alpha and composite reliability cr index were employed to confirm the model s reliability cr is an index of internal consistency in scale items which is equal to the total extent of true score variance relative to the variance of total scale score brunner and süß 2005 since cronbach s alpha tends to underestimate reliability values and cr tends to overestimate internal consistency the real reliability lies in the two values hence they were assessed simultaneously and interpreted bagheri et al 2021b according to hair et al 2006 cr values between 0 6 and 0 7 are acceptable while the values above 0 7 are excellent as shown in table 1 all cr values of the model were above 0 7 convergent and divergent validity were used to determine discriminant validity the convergent validity of the model s constructs was assessed by the average variance extracted ave which shows how much of the variance of a construct is influenced by indicator variables fornell and larcker 1981 a minimum value of 0 50 is acceptable for ave mackenzie et al 2005 hair et al 2006 as shown in table 1 all ave values were above 0 5 finally the overall fit of the model was examined by using the goodness of fit gof index mackenzie et al 2005 henseler and sarstedt 2013 the values of 0 01 0 25 and 0 35 indicate weak moderate and good values of gof respectively wetzels et al 2009 the gof value calculated in this study was 0 692 3 results 3 1 demographic characteristics the results showed that the respondents were in middle age 49 8 11 4 and had 33 15 12 75 years of farming experience on average they had 12 5 ha of farmland that was dispersed in 16 25 8 84 parcels regarding education 26 6 were illiterate 33 6 had an elementary level of education and the remained had high school or university education 3 2 examining the tpb constructs of the study the mean and sd of six constructs of the study are presented in table 2 as was already described the items of the constructs were scored over 1 5 from very low never to very much always attitude towards swc the result showed that the respondents had relatively positive attitudes towards swc mean 3 59 0 62 the item conservation practices prevent the destruction of water and soil was placed in the top rank while the lowest rank was given to heavy rainfall affects the destruction of water and soil resources subjective norms towards swc the overall mean score of subjective norms 3 13 indicates that the respondents perceived the referent people as moderately influential amongst six statements the highest importance was given to other farmers 3 93 while the family was given the lowest importance 2 49 after agricultural experts 2 57 moral norms towards swc the relatively high overall mean 3 87 and high scores of all statements indicate that the majority of the respondents were morally committed to using swc practices perceived behavioral control the average score of this construct 3 23 showed that the respondents had moderately good control on their behavior in using swc practices the item i can prepare and use manure compost to maintain soil fertility 4 12 0 93 was perceived as highly controlled behavior whereas i can afford to buy and use swc machinery and equipment 2 50 1 04 which was scored the lowest indicated that financial limitation to buying necessary equipment was a barrier to using some swc practices behavioral intention towards the adoption of swc practices the average score of this construct 3 24 showed that the respondents were moderately intended to use swc practices the use of decomposed manure 4 14 0 98 and dredging irrigation canals 4 10 0 87 were ranked as highly intended swc practices while the use of windbreak 2 62 1 35 and building water and flood dyke 2 57 1 13 were ranked as the lowest intended practices respectively actual adoption of swc practices the average score of items of this construct 2 81 0 70 indicated that farmers moderately adopted the swc practices like intended practices using decomposed manure 3 79 1 12 and dredging irrigation canals 3 64 1 01 were highly adopted practices while using windbreak 2 05 1 15 and building water and flood dyke 1 93 0 1 were ranked as the lowest adopted practices respectively these results are presented in table 2 3 3 comparisons of intended and actual adopted swc practices regardless of the significance of the results changing intentions towards swc into practice was considered negative ranks a imply that the mean score of adoption was lower than the intended score in other words respondents did not achieve the practice as they intended while positive ranks b means that the respondents adopted the practice more than they intended and the ties c imply that they adopted the practice as equal as they intended as illustrated in table 3 the adoption rate of most swc practices ties plus positives negatives except for compost and water and flood dyke was much more than the negatives it should be noted that the negative cases do not mean non adoption of the practices it indicates that the adoption scores were lower than the intended scores nevertheless it may range from absolute non adoption to a bit lower than the intended scores the highest level of adoption of intended practice was related to conservation tillage and the lowest was related to mulch 3 4 correlation analyses and testing hypotheses of the model the results of pearson correlation analysis showed a significant and positive correlation between the constructs of the model table 4 the research hypotheses were tested using path analysis fig 3 the impacts of attitudes subjective norms moral norms and pbc on behavioral intention towards swc and actual adoption of swc practices were examined moreover the determination coefficients r2 were calculated to show the total variance of intention and actual adoption accounted for by the model s constructs table 5 as shown in table 5 attitude showed a significant and direct impact of 0 150 on behavioral intention and the first hypothesis h1 was confirmed according to this result the more positive the attitudes towards swc the more positive the intention towards the adoption of swc practices moral norms with a direct impact of 0 074 had no significant impact on intention therefore h2 was refuted the impact of subjective norms on intention was examined in h3 and confirmed by a significant and direct impact of 0 12 t 1 55 this result indicates that the positive influence of referent people might result in positive intentions towards adopting swc practices pbc showed a powerful and significant impact on the intention 0 649 and confirmed h4 this construct also showed a significant impact on the actual adoption of swc practices with a total impact of 1 55 therefore h5 was also confirmed based on these two results the more the perceptions towards control on one s behavior the more probable the positive intentions towards the actual adoption of swc practices finally the impact of intention on actual adoption was examined in h6 with a direct impact of 0 582 this result was significant and h6 was confirmed this means that positive intention towards swc practices results in actual adoption of the practices based on the r2 values attitudes moral norms subjective norms and pbc totally explained 83 6 of the variance in intention and pbc and intention captured 77 9 of the variance in actual adoption 4 discussion while several studies have been conducted to identify farmers soil and water conservation adoption few studies in the world and no study in iran have dealt with this issue using the socio psychological model of tpb moreover no studies have investigated how much farmers put into practice their intended swc practices therefore for the first time the present research employed tpb to model farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices in heris county in east azarbayjan province iran based on the results except for the extended construct of moral norms all hypotheses of the study were validated which confirms the importance of considering socio psychological drivers of farmers decision making processes edwards jones 2006 mills et al 2016 the results also showed that the respondents had fairly positive intentions towards adopting the swc practices while the adoption rate was slightly lower than the intended there were positive correlations between intended and actual adopted practices this result confirms the basic principle of tpb that claims intention affects actual adoption ajzen 1991 fishbein and ajzen 2011 the use of decomposed manure and dredging irrigation canals were the highly intended and adopted swc practices while the use of windbreak and building water and flood dyke were ranked as the lowest intended and adopted practices respectively despite the fairly positive attitude of farmers the result indicates that small scale farmers are willing to adopt low cost swc practices which can be implemented using available facilities indeed the positive attitudes can be effective in the presence of economic ability and probably the relatively weak positive impact of the attitudes on behavioral intentions can be interpreted in relation to financial barriers to implementing cost intensive swc practices smallholders do not have the financial ability to invest in expensive practices if policymakers and officials want to implement such conservation practices by farmers they should provide incentives financial facilities and funding for investment in costly swc techniques based on the results the respondents retained plant residues on their farms but did not use them as organic mulch because they owned small crop livestock systems they retained straw and plant residues for livestock grazing in the field after harvesting previous studies in iran bagheri 2010 have found that farmers usually consider crop residues a barrier to easy tillage practice many farmers set fire or remove crop residues from farms to facilitate tillage practices this result also holds for tillage practices most respondents were dependent on moldboard for tillage and they did not replace it with chisel while not using moldboard and not setting fire on plant residues are of the sustainable land management strategies of the agricultural sector in iran correlation between the adoptions of conservation practices should be considered by those involved in the water and soil conservation department of the ministry of agriculture due to low awareness and knowledge some misconceptions are common among farmers that should be modified through extension campaigns while respondents had moderately positive attitudes towards swc the reverse item of heavy rainfall affects the destruction of water and soil resources indicates that knowledge and the conditions around farmers form their attitude this result corroborates petty and cacioppo 1996 who argue that people s attitudes are influenced by other people and the environment around them the study area has a mountainous and cold climate where precipitation is mainly in the form of snow and there is deficient heavy rainfall whose runoff would destruct soil and water resources the main problem related to soil and water management can be attributed to land use systems the significant and positive impact of attitudes on behavioral intention with a t value of a bit less than 1 96 indicates that farmers who have a positive evaluation of swc practices are more likely to have a good intention to implement conservation practices this finding is in line with previous tpb studies which have found that attitude is an essential predictor of farmers behavioral intentions towards soil conservation and sustainable farming practices wauters et al 2010 zeweld et al 2017 however floress et al 2017 found that farmers conservation attitudes were not in themselves adequate to explain their behavioral intentions related to the behavior in question subjective norms trafimow and finlay 2001 and pbc zhang et al 2016 wilson et al 2018 are other important determinants of farmers behavior considering the impact of attitudes on intentions policy interventions aimed at emphasizing the benefits of swc practices to farmers could increase farmers intention to adopt swc practices incentives in the form of financial supports and information on best practices of land management through radio tv educational programs are some of the effective interventions extension field visits to demonstrate the farms where farmers have successfully adopted soil and water conserving technologies is another possible strategy that has been suggested by previous studies to increase farmers intention to adopt farming innovations martínez garcía et al 2013 senger et al 2017 the extended construct of moral norms showed that the majority of the respondents were morally committed to swc this construct had no significant influence on the intentions contradictory results were found in previous studies on the impact of this construct on intentions while some studies have found weak impacts adnan et al 2017 others have reported positive impacts bagheri et al 2019 kaiser and scheuthle 2003 regarding the adoption of swc practices because of the importance of personal moral commitment positive moral norms are essential in developing soil and water conservation and preventing soil erosion in iran as a region with a high degree of global soil erosion the positive and significant correlation of this construct with attitudes and intentions implies that positive moral norms can improve attitudes and intentions while moral norms refer to internal moral principles and values subjective norms sn are related to external social pressure adnan et al 2017 according to burton 2004 people may put aside their personal opinions and rational principles in favor of the views of referent groups sn indicates how much a person is under the influence of other trusted people who are important to him or her wang et al 2018 the mean score of the construct mean 3 13 showed that the respondents perceived to be moderately under the influence of other trusted and important people the greatest influence was attributed to other farmers 3 93 who use swc practices and produce more crops while agricultural experts were perceived to be less influential on their decisions despite the fact that it is essential to follow progressive farmers the low importance of agricultural experts as an important source of swc information mainly implies the empathy of respondents with other people in their social system rogers 1962 or the fear of social exclusion from not conforming to what is deemed to be a good practice bamberg and moser 2007 rather than following scientific methods for swc the importance of social pressure on farmers intention has been confirmed in previous studies too borges et al 2014 senger et al 2017 adnan et al 2017 daxini et al 2019 burton 2004 found that because individuals do not behave independently from social influences there are referent groups to which they often refer in their behavior hence the practices used by these referent groups are trusted and followed by other farmers even if they have insufficient knowledge of swc practices jongeneel et al 2008 indicated that farmers trust in the government determines their decisions to diversify therefore if agricultural field experts want to play an influential role in the adoption and use of conservation practices by farmers they must first consider the farming practices of such referent people and groups and persuade them to adopt conservation methods then because their disseminated swc practices have a direct impact on farmers livelihoods they have to gain the trust of farmers in the use of conservation practices demonstrating educational films of eroded areas and areas that are engaged in agriculture using soil and water conservation practices can be effective previous studies have also revealed that sn has a positive impact on the formation of individuals attitudes bamberg and moser 2007 zhang et al 2016 then the favorable sn can result in positive attitudes towards swc because of the scientific nature of swc techniques the strong influence of extension field experts as an essential source of information on swc can result in positive attitudes and thereby positive intentions towards the implementation of swc practices as o keefe 2016 noted professional information sources such as approved farm advisors and extension field experts are often essential when practices are complex they are also crucial to develop farmers perceptions as generalist sources such as other farmers and family members daxini et al 2019 pbc consists of perceived control and perceived difficulty of a specific behavior fielding et al 2008 the result showed that respondents had moderate pbc mean 3 23 indicating the ease of use of some practices but low control over technical practices similar findings have been found in previous studies daxini et al 2019 the results of path analysis also revealed that pbc is the most essential determinant of behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices this construct also showed a powerful impact on actual adoption which indicates that farmers perceptions of the level of easiness and degree of control over using swc practices is important in determining the intention to adopt them zhang et al 2016 wilson et al 2018 the study extended the literature on socio psychological factors affecting the adoption of swc technologies that is the first time conducted in iran because the study focused on a specific region in iran and on soil and water conservation policy intervention should not be generalized to other regions and other farmers however the findings of this study revealed that the tpb framework using sem is appropriate to explain famers decision making process and conservation behavior and to present policy implications for sustainable resource use therefore future studies could use this framework to understand farmers conservation behavior in other contexts the main policy implications that emerged from the results are as follows before designing and implementing swc projects public awareness and farmers attitudes toward adoption and implementing programs should be studied considering the effect of the reference farmers in the conservation decision of farmers the social norms of the target areas should be studied and the reference farmers should be identified trained and accompanied by the plans conservation machinery and equipment should be available for implementing some conservation practices for example conventional tractors that are used are not appropriate for plowing perpendicular to the slope because of the different nature of conservation compared to conventional farming extension agencies must shift their strategies towards conservation farming resource poor farmers are often risk averse in addition to extension training programs they need financial incentives to adopt conservation practices finally like other cross sectional researches this study has some limitations that should be taken into account the study was conducted using a sample of farmers in a specific region and time hence it may be susceptible to sampling bias and changing farmers intentions over time more studies with other populations and over time can provide better insights for policy makers therefore future studies ought to embrace additional farmers cultivating in different areas in several regions the findings are based on self reporting responses where social desirability bias consistency and connection with natural behavior may be problems for these problems we conducted field visiting in the final stage of the study to realize how many swc practices were adopted an inherent limitation of all tpb studies is that what happens between the moment the intention is formed and the moment the behavior is performed is still unknown bagheri et al 2019 to solve this problem we examined the actual adoption of studied practices in a separate stage our result showed high consistency between intended and actual adopted practices 5 conclusion this study used the well known framework of tpb to model farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices the findings provided new insights into the efficacy of tpb to predict small scale farmers intentions and actual adoption of swc practices the basic assumption of tpb based on the effect of intentions on actual adoption was confirmed indicating that there were good consistencies between intended and actual adopted practices despite the moderately positive attitudes towards swc and positive impact on intentions some low cost and available practices were adopted and used the wrong attitudes towards retaining straw and residues as organic mulch that were related to the difficulty in using moldboard plow indicate that the associations among swc practices need to be considered because the implementation of an incorrect practice may lead to other incorrect practices the results of positive attitudes and moral norms imply that smallholders believe in conserving the resources on which their livelihood is dependent but it is sometimes beyond their abilities policy intervention and public investment in cost intensive conservation technologies are needed considering the high rate of soil erosion and subsidence of groundwater tables in iran it highlights the importance of these interventions and investments based on the result of subjective norms farmers are under the influence of other farmers and referent groups and follow the social norms at the same time approved sources of technical information have a low influence on farmers decisions pbc showed the most positive impact on behavioral intention while farmers were using accessible practices they had low control over technical practices these two results lead us to suggest that educational interventions such as radio tv public education on the importance of swc extension campaigns on training conservation agriculture and visiting fields where implemented conservation practices are essential this study has implications for agricultural policy makers and extension agencies to prevent soil and water resource degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9819,soil erosion is either caused by natural agents or induced by human activities human activities play a decisive role in soil erosion type and extent numerous studies have been conducted on the adoption of soil and water conservation swc but farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices are not well documented this study employed the theory of planned behavior to model farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices in heris county in east azarbayjan province iran except for the extended construct of moral norms all research hypotheses were validated confirming the importance of socio psychological factors in farmers decision making low cost practices that could be implemented using available facilities were adopted but technical and costly practices were not

implications for policymakers and extension agencies keywords intention adoption theory of planned behavior soil and water conservation practices 1 introduction soil and water erosion is one of the leading causes of land degradation which has emerged as a serious global threat iran is located in the arid and semiarid zone of the world zarghani et al 2013 and it suffers from severe soil erosion khajavi et al 2015 roozitalab 1990 soil erosion brings about both on site and off site detrimental impacts in the short and long run majoro et al 2020 sileshi et al 2019 boardman et al 2019 2006 erkossa et al 2018 boardman and poesen 2006 lal 2001 soil erosion is either caused by natural agents or induced by human activities issaka and ashraf 2017 human activities play a decisive role in soil erosion type and extent wang et al 2003 small scale farmers as residents and beneficiaries of the natural resources in developing countries play a crucial role in resource conservation bayat et al 2011 it is therefore necessary for policymakers stakeholders and officials of sustainable agriculture and natural resources management to identify their conservation behaviors depending on country or region there are a series of conservation technologies to mitigate soil and water erosion based on the literature minimum tillage contour plowing contour cropping alley cropping trash lines cover crops manure composting grass buffer strips retention ditches agronomic practices agroforestry water harvesting options such as tied ridges and pond construction mulching bench terraces conservation farming integrated nutrient management crop rotation intercropping fallowing floodwalls and dams dredging and weeding of irrigation canals leveling and terracing sloppy farmlands are of sound measures for soil and water conservation swc kagoya et al 2018 ashoori et al 2016 turinawe et al 2015 mugonola et al 2013 wauters et al 2010 many studies have been conducted to elicit factors affecting the adoption of swc technologies belachew et al 2020 iyilade et al 2020 mekuriaw et al 2018 asfaw and neka 2017 de graaff et al 2008 however the adoption rate remains low and undesirable there is no clear evidence why farmers choose to follow an agricultural technology ulrich schad et al 2017 in addition previous studies have failed to provide a comprehensive understanding of farmers decision making process zeweld et al 2017 feola et al 2015 this might be due to the lack of a sound theoretical basis for the inclusion of socio psychological issues in the analysis of the decision making daxini et al 2019 borges and oude lansink 2016 if agricultural policymakers are to develop policy initiatives based on research findings they should seek methodologies that are theoretically appropriate quantitative repeatable and applicable at a large scale beedell and rehman 2000 when considering these aspects the impact of socio economic variables tends to lose its explanatory power poppenborg and koellner 2013 therefore there is an increasing tendency towards incorporating socio psychological theoretical frameworks to better understand farmers decision making process and use these insights to develop better policy initiatives daxini et al 2019 adnan et al 2017 floress et al 2017 the theory of planned behavior tpb ajzen 1991 is a well known socio psychological framework that gained growing attention especially in human resources studies armitage and conner 2001 fielding et al 2005 and more recently to explain farmers environmental behavior govindharaj et al 2021 tama et al 2021 damalas 2021 bagheri et al 2021a 2021b 2019 daxini et al 2019 adnan et al 2017 understanding farmers intentions and behavior towards the adoption of swc practices has paramount importance in protecting soil erosion and conserving water resources thereby avoiding land degradation beedell and rehman 2000 fielding et al 2008 wauters et al 2010 however there is little knowledge about farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices few studies have already examined farmers intentions and actual adoption towards adopting swc practices wauters et al 2010 and no study in iran has ever explored it by the tpb theoretical framework the present study therefore aimed to investigate the intended and actual adoption of swc practices in heris county in east azarbayjan province iran several studies have applied farm management models to explain farmers decision making in adopting new farming technologies such models are applicable when the innovation is easy to adopt and there are clear economic advantages and no intervening considerations sinden and king 1990 although farmers are interested in profit maximizing cost benefit models cannot fully capture the complexity of their behavior bagheri et al 2016 flett et al 2004 lynne et al 1988 in the case of the adoption of swc practices due to the involvement of environmental and social considerations a cost benefit analysis can provide answers to adoption but it does not take all related costs and benefits into account it is the reason why farmers may not adopt a technology even though the economic evidence suggests they should and why they adopt an swc practice even when economic prospects are not clear wauters et al 2010 therefore to achieve the objective of this study the tpb was employed to model small scale farmers intended and actual behavior the results will be helpful to draw the attention of agricultural policymakers towards socio psychological factors behind farmers decisions to adopt swc practices which are beyond economic only objectives several theories were presented to explain people s intentions and behavior diffusion of innovation theory doi social cognitive theory sct theory of reasoned action tra theory of planned behavior tpb and technology acceptance model tam are of well known behavioral theories the doi rogers 1962 was developed to explain how an innovation diffuses through a social system the theory divides people into five adoption groups i e innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards and exerts that people s characteristics is important to the adoption of an innovation the sct bandura 1989 claims that learning occurs in a social context with a dynamic interaction of behavior environment and individual like doi the theory considers the importance of social context in which people exhibit the behavior and their previous experiences that influence them to perform the behavior the tam was developed to explain the adoption of information based technologies based on the tam two attitudinal components of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are key determinants of acceptance and use of an information based technology while a number of studies showed the ability of tam to explain the variance in usage intentions and actual adoption jokar et al 2017 conflicting reports were presented as to its impact on intentions davis 1985 1993 venkatesh and davis 2000 venkatesh et al 2003 the tra states that behavior is a function of attitudes subjective norms and behavioral intentions fishbein and ajzen 1975 and intention is in turn a function of subjective norms and attitudes ajzen 1991 later included the construct of the perceived behavioral control in the tra and modified it as tpb the tpb posits that people s decision to engage in a particular behavior at a specific place is driven by their intentions which are determined by three constructs i e attitude subjective norm and perceived behavioral control pbc ajzen 1991 attitude refers to a positive or negative assessment of a specific behavior which consists of behavioral beliefs and an assessment of the implications of the behavior wang et al 2018 the more positive the attitudes the stronger the intention to perform a particular behavior adnan et al 2017 according to ajzen 1991 subjective norms refer to the perceived social pressure on an individual to exhibit or not to exhibit a particular behavior bagheri et al 2019 it implies that individuals behave under the influence of trusted people who are important to them and wish them to behave in a specific manner wang et al 2018 it also positively affects people s intentions chen and tung 2014 pbc refers to the perceived ease or difficulty of displaying a behavior under the individual s voluntary control fielding et al 2008 it consists of perceived difficulty and perceived control in that the latter has a slight impact on the intention it also impacts behavior directly or indirectly through behavioral intention bagheri et al 2019 behavioral intention refers to the extent to which an individual tries to perform a particular behavior and implies the readiness of people to perform a behavior fishbein and ajzen 2011 it is connected to the determinants more strongly than actual adoption so it can be predicted more readily adnan et al 2017 the intention is an immediate determinant of behavior ajzen 1991 moral norms as an extended construct of the tpb refer to the sense of displaying a particular moral behavior that makes individuals findings dependent on their rules or responsibility ajzen 1991 arvola et al 2008 defined moral norms as rules of morality that people have to follow moral norms differ from subjective norms while subjective norms are related to external social pressure moral norms are differentiated by the internalized moral values adnan et al 2017 they are moral principles or values that are prompted by rewards or self guilty punishments and significantly increase the understanding of people s intentions bagheri et al 2019 kaiser and scheuthle 2003 based on the conceptual framework and fig 1 the hypotheses of the study are proposed as follows h1 attitudes influence behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices h2 moral norms influence behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices h3 subjective norms influence behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices h4 pbc influences behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices h5 pbc influences the actual adoption of swc practices h6 behavioral intentions influence the actual adoption of swc practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices was examined in heris county in eastern azarbayjan province iran fig 2 the county latitude 38 24n longitude 47 22 e has an area of 2377 6 km2 about 70 of which is plain and the remaining 30 is mountainous the lowest and highest points of the county are 1500 and 3143 m above sea level respectively heris county has a cold steppe climate in the hills and a mediterranean climate in the lowland area generally it has cold and frosty winters and mild summers with min and max temperatures of 25 c and 35 c in winter and summer respectively the average annual precipitation of the county is 351 mm of which 87 mm often falls in autumn 90 mm in winter 173 mm in spring and 1 mm in summer the county accounts for about 2 3 of the total area of the province since it is located in the foothills of the bozghush sabolaghdagh aghdagh and ghoshadagh mountains and has 70 of the plain area with fertile soils the county has a high potential for agricultural and animal production in addition to autumn rainfalls the melting of winter snows and a part of water flowing from natural springs the talkhehroud river which originates from the heights of sabalan qoshadagh aniakhli aghdagh bozghush and the northern slopes of sahand is the primary source of water supply in the region the other vital water resources in the region are the heris zarnaq ojanchay mesil minegh khalaj and nimroor rivers annually the region hosts 7000 nomadic families engaged in animal rearing in the foothills and rangelands the farming system of the region is subsistence semi traditional and semi mechanized the water and soil resources are mostly exploited for a combination of crop animal production most croplands of the county are devoted to wheat and barley fodder grasses legumes summer crops onions and potatoes are the next important crops respectively this county has two districts markazi and khajeh six rural districts dehestans and five urban areas namely heris bakhshayesh zarnagh kelvanegh and khajeh 2 2 sampling instrument and data collection all farmers in the talkhehroud basin of heris county n 7636 constituted the research statistical population the region consists of six rural districts dehestans including 92 villages and six towns mpo 2015 the sample size was determined to be 220 farmers using cochran s 1977 sampling formula at the 95 confidence level the multistage random sampling method with the proportional assignment was employed for data collection so three villages or towns were randomly selected from each rural district for the rural district of western bedustan four villages were selected because of its larger size compared to the other rural districts a total of 16 villages and three towns were selected and 10 12 farmers from each village or town were randomly interviewed for data collection the questionnaires were filled out through face to face interviews at farmers homes or on the farm before data collection farmers were briefly informed about the objectives of the study and only volunteer farmers were interviewed the standard questionnaire of tpb was used as the data collection instrument in which necessary modifications were made based on the research objectives in addition to socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents the instrument consisted of tpb constructs i e attitudes towards swc 11 items subjective norms on swc 6 items perceived behavioral control on swc 6 items behavioral intentions 10 items and actual behaviors 12 items towards the application of swc practices an extended construct namely moral norms on swc practices 6 items was added to the tpb model table 2 the statements of the tpb constructs were formed by a literature review and consultation with university staff experts of agricultural science and natural resource especially experts in soil and water conservation and field visits to see swc practices used by farmers tpb constructs were examined on a five point likert scale from completely disagree 1 to fully agree 5 and vice versa for reverse items for the construct of actual adoption the items were examined from never 1 to always 5 a group of experts including university staff and agricultural and natural resources experts confirmed the content validity of the instrument a pilot study was conducted with a sample of 30 farmers from the outside of the sample villages for two weeks in may 2019 to pretest the instrument cronbach s alpha formula 1 was calculated to determine the reliability of the questionnaire the alpha values above 0 70 indicate acceptable reliability nunnally 1978 the alpha values obtained for all constructs in the pilot study were above 0 7 reflecting the high reliability of the questionnaire the field survey with the final draft of the questionnaire was conducted during july october in 2019 data were collected in the first three months and the last month was devoted to field visits to see how many practices were applied over the studied cropping year and to compare the intended and actual adoption of the studied swc practices for this purpose the participants were listed and asked to participate in the field visit stage 1 cronbach s alpha α k c v k 1 c k the number of items c the average of all covariance between items v the average variance of each item 2 3 data analysis data were coded standardized and analyzed in three stages matlab software was used to normalize the data in the first stage then the spss v 22 package was used for initial analysis including frequencies percentages mean scores and standard deviations sd the nonparametric wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to measure how many respondents have put their intention into practice and adopted the intended swc practices in their farms pearson correlation analysis was used to examine correlation between constructs of the tpb model finally partial least squares for structural equation modeling smart pls sem a widely used software in human resource research bagheri et al 2021b wu 2010 was used to test the research hypotheses sem is used to test complex relationships between observed and latent variables as well as relationships between several latent variables constructs are the latent variables that are estimated by some observed variables dijkstra and henseler 2015 it applies principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression to examine the path model s partial regression relationships to maximize the variance explained and minimize the error terms of the endogenous constructs hair et al 2017 2019 cronbach s alpha and composite reliability cr index were employed to confirm the model s reliability cr is an index of internal consistency in scale items which is equal to the total extent of true score variance relative to the variance of total scale score brunner and süß 2005 since cronbach s alpha tends to underestimate reliability values and cr tends to overestimate internal consistency the real reliability lies in the two values hence they were assessed simultaneously and interpreted bagheri et al 2021b according to hair et al 2006 cr values between 0 6 and 0 7 are acceptable while the values above 0 7 are excellent as shown in table 1 all cr values of the model were above 0 7 convergent and divergent validity were used to determine discriminant validity the convergent validity of the model s constructs was assessed by the average variance extracted ave which shows how much of the variance of a construct is influenced by indicator variables fornell and larcker 1981 a minimum value of 0 50 is acceptable for ave mackenzie et al 2005 hair et al 2006 as shown in table 1 all ave values were above 0 5 finally the overall fit of the model was examined by using the goodness of fit gof index mackenzie et al 2005 henseler and sarstedt 2013 the values of 0 01 0 25 and 0 35 indicate weak moderate and good values of gof respectively wetzels et al 2009 the gof value calculated in this study was 0 692 3 results 3 1 demographic characteristics the results showed that the respondents were in middle age 49 8 11 4 and had 33 15 12 75 years of farming experience on average they had 12 5 ha of farmland that was dispersed in 16 25 8 84 parcels regarding education 26 6 were illiterate 33 6 had an elementary level of education and the remained had high school or university education 3 2 examining the tpb constructs of the study the mean and sd of six constructs of the study are presented in table 2 as was already described the items of the constructs were scored over 1 5 from very low never to very much always attitude towards swc the result showed that the respondents had relatively positive attitudes towards swc mean 3 59 0 62 the item conservation practices prevent the destruction of water and soil was placed in the top rank while the lowest rank was given to heavy rainfall affects the destruction of water and soil resources subjective norms towards swc the overall mean score of subjective norms 3 13 indicates that the respondents perceived the referent people as moderately influential amongst six statements the highest importance was given to other farmers 3 93 while the family was given the lowest importance 2 49 after agricultural experts 2 57 moral norms towards swc the relatively high overall mean 3 87 and high scores of all statements indicate that the majority of the respondents were morally committed to using swc practices perceived behavioral control the average score of this construct 3 23 showed that the respondents had moderately good control on their behavior in using swc practices the item i can prepare and use manure compost to maintain soil fertility 4 12 0 93 was perceived as highly controlled behavior whereas i can afford to buy and use swc machinery and equipment 2 50 1 04 which was scored the lowest indicated that financial limitation to buying necessary equipment was a barrier to using some swc practices behavioral intention towards the adoption of swc practices the average score of this construct 3 24 showed that the respondents were moderately intended to use swc practices the use of decomposed manure 4 14 0 98 and dredging irrigation canals 4 10 0 87 were ranked as highly intended swc practices while the use of windbreak 2 62 1 35 and building water and flood dyke 2 57 1 13 were ranked as the lowest intended practices respectively actual adoption of swc practices the average score of items of this construct 2 81 0 70 indicated that farmers moderately adopted the swc practices like intended practices using decomposed manure 3 79 1 12 and dredging irrigation canals 3 64 1 01 were highly adopted practices while using windbreak 2 05 1 15 and building water and flood dyke 1 93 0 1 were ranked as the lowest adopted practices respectively these results are presented in table 2 3 3 comparisons of intended and actual adopted swc practices regardless of the significance of the results changing intentions towards swc into practice was considered negative ranks a imply that the mean score of adoption was lower than the intended score in other words respondents did not achieve the practice as they intended while positive ranks b means that the respondents adopted the practice more than they intended and the ties c imply that they adopted the practice as equal as they intended as illustrated in table 3 the adoption rate of most swc practices ties plus positives negatives except for compost and water and flood dyke was much more than the negatives it should be noted that the negative cases do not mean non adoption of the practices it indicates that the adoption scores were lower than the intended scores nevertheless it may range from absolute non adoption to a bit lower than the intended scores the highest level of adoption of intended practice was related to conservation tillage and the lowest was related to mulch 3 4 correlation analyses and testing hypotheses of the model the results of pearson correlation analysis showed a significant and positive correlation between the constructs of the model table 4 the research hypotheses were tested using path analysis fig 3 the impacts of attitudes subjective norms moral norms and pbc on behavioral intention towards swc and actual adoption of swc practices were examined moreover the determination coefficients r2 were calculated to show the total variance of intention and actual adoption accounted for by the model s constructs table 5 as shown in table 5 attitude showed a significant and direct impact of 0 150 on behavioral intention and the first hypothesis h1 was confirmed according to this result the more positive the attitudes towards swc the more positive the intention towards the adoption of swc practices moral norms with a direct impact of 0 074 had no significant impact on intention therefore h2 was refuted the impact of subjective norms on intention was examined in h3 and confirmed by a significant and direct impact of 0 12 t 1 55 this result indicates that the positive influence of referent people might result in positive intentions towards adopting swc practices pbc showed a powerful and significant impact on the intention 0 649 and confirmed h4 this construct also showed a significant impact on the actual adoption of swc practices with a total impact of 1 55 therefore h5 was also confirmed based on these two results the more the perceptions towards control on one s behavior the more probable the positive intentions towards the actual adoption of swc practices finally the impact of intention on actual adoption was examined in h6 with a direct impact of 0 582 this result was significant and h6 was confirmed this means that positive intention towards swc practices results in actual adoption of the practices based on the r2 values attitudes moral norms subjective norms and pbc totally explained 83 6 of the variance in intention and pbc and intention captured 77 9 of the variance in actual adoption 4 discussion while several studies have been conducted to identify farmers soil and water conservation adoption few studies in the world and no study in iran have dealt with this issue using the socio psychological model of tpb moreover no studies have investigated how much farmers put into practice their intended swc practices therefore for the first time the present research employed tpb to model farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices in heris county in east azarbayjan province iran based on the results except for the extended construct of moral norms all hypotheses of the study were validated which confirms the importance of considering socio psychological drivers of farmers decision making processes edwards jones 2006 mills et al 2016 the results also showed that the respondents had fairly positive intentions towards adopting the swc practices while the adoption rate was slightly lower than the intended there were positive correlations between intended and actual adopted practices this result confirms the basic principle of tpb that claims intention affects actual adoption ajzen 1991 fishbein and ajzen 2011 the use of decomposed manure and dredging irrigation canals were the highly intended and adopted swc practices while the use of windbreak and building water and flood dyke were ranked as the lowest intended and adopted practices respectively despite the fairly positive attitude of farmers the result indicates that small scale farmers are willing to adopt low cost swc practices which can be implemented using available facilities indeed the positive attitudes can be effective in the presence of economic ability and probably the relatively weak positive impact of the attitudes on behavioral intentions can be interpreted in relation to financial barriers to implementing cost intensive swc practices smallholders do not have the financial ability to invest in expensive practices if policymakers and officials want to implement such conservation practices by farmers they should provide incentives financial facilities and funding for investment in costly swc techniques based on the results the respondents retained plant residues on their farms but did not use them as organic mulch because they owned small crop livestock systems they retained straw and plant residues for livestock grazing in the field after harvesting previous studies in iran bagheri 2010 have found that farmers usually consider crop residues a barrier to easy tillage practice many farmers set fire or remove crop residues from farms to facilitate tillage practices this result also holds for tillage practices most respondents were dependent on moldboard for tillage and they did not replace it with chisel while not using moldboard and not setting fire on plant residues are of the sustainable land management strategies of the agricultural sector in iran correlation between the adoptions of conservation practices should be considered by those involved in the water and soil conservation department of the ministry of agriculture due to low awareness and knowledge some misconceptions are common among farmers that should be modified through extension campaigns while respondents had moderately positive attitudes towards swc the reverse item of heavy rainfall affects the destruction of water and soil resources indicates that knowledge and the conditions around farmers form their attitude this result corroborates petty and cacioppo 1996 who argue that people s attitudes are influenced by other people and the environment around them the study area has a mountainous and cold climate where precipitation is mainly in the form of snow and there is deficient heavy rainfall whose runoff would destruct soil and water resources the main problem related to soil and water management can be attributed to land use systems the significant and positive impact of attitudes on behavioral intention with a t value of a bit less than 1 96 indicates that farmers who have a positive evaluation of swc practices are more likely to have a good intention to implement conservation practices this finding is in line with previous tpb studies which have found that attitude is an essential predictor of farmers behavioral intentions towards soil conservation and sustainable farming practices wauters et al 2010 zeweld et al 2017 however floress et al 2017 found that farmers conservation attitudes were not in themselves adequate to explain their behavioral intentions related to the behavior in question subjective norms trafimow and finlay 2001 and pbc zhang et al 2016 wilson et al 2018 are other important determinants of farmers behavior considering the impact of attitudes on intentions policy interventions aimed at emphasizing the benefits of swc practices to farmers could increase farmers intention to adopt swc practices incentives in the form of financial supports and information on best practices of land management through radio tv educational programs are some of the effective interventions extension field visits to demonstrate the farms where farmers have successfully adopted soil and water conserving technologies is another possible strategy that has been suggested by previous studies to increase farmers intention to adopt farming innovations martínez garcía et al 2013 senger et al 2017 the extended construct of moral norms showed that the majority of the respondents were morally committed to swc this construct had no significant influence on the intentions contradictory results were found in previous studies on the impact of this construct on intentions while some studies have found weak impacts adnan et al 2017 others have reported positive impacts bagheri et al 2019 kaiser and scheuthle 2003 regarding the adoption of swc practices because of the importance of personal moral commitment positive moral norms are essential in developing soil and water conservation and preventing soil erosion in iran as a region with a high degree of global soil erosion the positive and significant correlation of this construct with attitudes and intentions implies that positive moral norms can improve attitudes and intentions while moral norms refer to internal moral principles and values subjective norms sn are related to external social pressure adnan et al 2017 according to burton 2004 people may put aside their personal opinions and rational principles in favor of the views of referent groups sn indicates how much a person is under the influence of other trusted people who are important to him or her wang et al 2018 the mean score of the construct mean 3 13 showed that the respondents perceived to be moderately under the influence of other trusted and important people the greatest influence was attributed to other farmers 3 93 who use swc practices and produce more crops while agricultural experts were perceived to be less influential on their decisions despite the fact that it is essential to follow progressive farmers the low importance of agricultural experts as an important source of swc information mainly implies the empathy of respondents with other people in their social system rogers 1962 or the fear of social exclusion from not conforming to what is deemed to be a good practice bamberg and moser 2007 rather than following scientific methods for swc the importance of social pressure on farmers intention has been confirmed in previous studies too borges et al 2014 senger et al 2017 adnan et al 2017 daxini et al 2019 burton 2004 found that because individuals do not behave independently from social influences there are referent groups to which they often refer in their behavior hence the practices used by these referent groups are trusted and followed by other farmers even if they have insufficient knowledge of swc practices jongeneel et al 2008 indicated that farmers trust in the government determines their decisions to diversify therefore if agricultural field experts want to play an influential role in the adoption and use of conservation practices by farmers they must first consider the farming practices of such referent people and groups and persuade them to adopt conservation methods then because their disseminated swc practices have a direct impact on farmers livelihoods they have to gain the trust of farmers in the use of conservation practices demonstrating educational films of eroded areas and areas that are engaged in agriculture using soil and water conservation practices can be effective previous studies have also revealed that sn has a positive impact on the formation of individuals attitudes bamberg and moser 2007 zhang et al 2016 then the favorable sn can result in positive attitudes towards swc because of the scientific nature of swc techniques the strong influence of extension field experts as an essential source of information on swc can result in positive attitudes and thereby positive intentions towards the implementation of swc practices as o keefe 2016 noted professional information sources such as approved farm advisors and extension field experts are often essential when practices are complex they are also crucial to develop farmers perceptions as generalist sources such as other farmers and family members daxini et al 2019 pbc consists of perceived control and perceived difficulty of a specific behavior fielding et al 2008 the result showed that respondents had moderate pbc mean 3 23 indicating the ease of use of some practices but low control over technical practices similar findings have been found in previous studies daxini et al 2019 the results of path analysis also revealed that pbc is the most essential determinant of behavioral intentions towards the adoption of swc practices this construct also showed a powerful impact on actual adoption which indicates that farmers perceptions of the level of easiness and degree of control over using swc practices is important in determining the intention to adopt them zhang et al 2016 wilson et al 2018 the study extended the literature on socio psychological factors affecting the adoption of swc technologies that is the first time conducted in iran because the study focused on a specific region in iran and on soil and water conservation policy intervention should not be generalized to other regions and other farmers however the findings of this study revealed that the tpb framework using sem is appropriate to explain famers decision making process and conservation behavior and to present policy implications for sustainable resource use therefore future studies could use this framework to understand farmers conservation behavior in other contexts the main policy implications that emerged from the results are as follows before designing and implementing swc projects public awareness and farmers attitudes toward adoption and implementing programs should be studied considering the effect of the reference farmers in the conservation decision of farmers the social norms of the target areas should be studied and the reference farmers should be identified trained and accompanied by the plans conservation machinery and equipment should be available for implementing some conservation practices for example conventional tractors that are used are not appropriate for plowing perpendicular to the slope because of the different nature of conservation compared to conventional farming extension agencies must shift their strategies towards conservation farming resource poor farmers are often risk averse in addition to extension training programs they need financial incentives to adopt conservation practices finally like other cross sectional researches this study has some limitations that should be taken into account the study was conducted using a sample of farmers in a specific region and time hence it may be susceptible to sampling bias and changing farmers intentions over time more studies with other populations and over time can provide better insights for policy makers therefore future studies ought to embrace additional farmers cultivating in different areas in several regions the findings are based on self reporting responses where social desirability bias consistency and connection with natural behavior may be problems for these problems we conducted field visiting in the final stage of the study to realize how many swc practices were adopted an inherent limitation of all tpb studies is that what happens between the moment the intention is formed and the moment the behavior is performed is still unknown bagheri et al 2019 to solve this problem we examined the actual adoption of studied practices in a separate stage our result showed high consistency between intended and actual adopted practices 5 conclusion this study used the well known framework of tpb to model farmers intended and actual adoption of swc practices the findings provided new insights into the efficacy of tpb to predict small scale farmers intentions and actual adoption of swc practices the basic assumption of tpb based on the effect of intentions on actual adoption was confirmed indicating that there were good consistencies between intended and actual adopted practices despite the moderately positive attitudes towards swc and positive impact on intentions some low cost and available practices were adopted and used the wrong attitudes towards retaining straw and residues as organic mulch that were related to the difficulty in using moldboard plow indicate that the associations among swc practices need to be considered because the implementation of an incorrect practice may lead to other incorrect practices the results of positive attitudes and moral norms imply that smallholders believe in conserving the resources on which their livelihood is dependent but it is sometimes beyond their abilities policy intervention and public investment in cost intensive conservation technologies are needed considering the high rate of soil erosion and subsidence of groundwater tables in iran it highlights the importance of these interventions and investments based on the result of subjective norms farmers are under the influence of other farmers and referent groups and follow the social norms at the same time approved sources of technical information have a low influence on farmers decisions pbc showed the most positive impact on behavioral intention while farmers were using accessible practices they had low control over technical practices these two results lead us to suggest that educational interventions such as radio tv public education on the importance of swc extension campaigns on training conservation agriculture and visiting fields where implemented conservation practices are essential this study has implications for agricultural policy makers and extension agencies to prevent soil and water resource degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
