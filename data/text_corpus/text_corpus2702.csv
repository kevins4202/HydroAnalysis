augmenting fresh water supply in urban areas 1 2 when reclaimed water is used for purposes that may involve contact with the human body such as recreational use and firefighting advanced water treatment processes become essential to minimize human health risks that could arise due to the presence of pathogens they are also necessary to realize positive aesthetics by reducing the unpleasant odors and unnatural color of the reclaimed water advanced wastewater treatment usually involves sand filtration pre treatment ozonation and biological activated carbon filtration after conventional wastewater treatment these approaches have been successfully implemented worldwide 2 4 treatment using nanofiltration nf membranes is capable of providing similar or better water quality than typical systems that use ozone and activated carbon 5 6 however the application of such membranes for full scale recycling of municipal wastewater is rarely adopted this can be attributed to the requirement of rigorous pre treatment e g microfiltration or ultrafiltration for alleviating membrane fouling 7 one of the limitations of the nf membranes is the need for suspended solid removal prior to the nf membrane treatment generally the nf process requires a rigorous pre treatment process involving a sand filter microfiltration or ultrafiltration to minimize membrane fouling 8 this is because nf membranes are typically supplied in spiral wound elements that have very narrow feed entries and tight channels the pre treatment necessitates both capital and operating costs thus any decrease in the cost of these pre treatment processes can reduce the overall treatment cost 9 10 however direct treatment using nf membranes without pre treatment processes is challenging due to the presence of suspended solids and organics at high concentrations in wastewater these can cause the clogging or plugging of the feed channel in nf elements and induce fast membrane fouling that necessitates frequent chemical cleaning in water recycling the alleviation of membrane fouling is key to the success of direct nanofiltration for example direct treatment of domestic wastewater by a capillary nf membrane has been previously evaluated at a permeate flux of up to 30 l m2h 11 however the nf system required frequent physical cleaning hydraulic flushing every 15 min and chemical cleaning e g every 1 4 days for which high chemical consumption was needed common fouling mitigation techniques without high chemical consumptions include application of high cross flow velocity which continuously cleans the membrane surface owing to the application of a shear force 12 although this high cross flow velocity is typically applied to waters with high fouling propensity high energy consumption is one of the limitations of this technique another technique that has shown effectiveness in water recycling is the application of low permeate flux 13 15 although the low permeate flux requires a greater membrane surface area for the generation of a specific permeate flow rate the application of the low permeate flux can considerably alleviate membrane fouling 16 additionally the low permeate flux has the advantage of reducing trans membrane pressure i e reducing energy use 7 17 18 however the efficacy of this low permeate flux approach for membrane fouling mitigation during the direct nf treatment of wastewater has not yet been explored furthermore the orientation of nf membrane modules is another great concern in almost all previous studies related to direct nf 19 22 tubular or capillary membrane modules were applied to avoid clogging or plugging in the feed channel and to enhance physical or chemical cleaning efficiency with low packing density spiral wound nf membrane elements cannot be utilized without pre treatment given that the large particles in wastewater can cause clogging of the feed channels therefore for the first time a flat sheet submerged nf membrane module was applied for the direct nf treatment of wastewater in the submerged module orientation filtration is driven by a vacuum created inside the membrane elements and a trans membrane pressure tmp of up to 100 kpa can be utilized for filtration 23 the advantage of the flat sheet submerged nf membrane module is its simple module structure which allows for the maximum effectiveness of the physical cleaning process for example with sponge cleaning when wastewater with high fouling propensity is used our previous study 24 demonstrated a low membrane fouling propensity of a flat sheet submerged nf membrane when it was used for direct nf treatment of water which was obtained from relatively clean surface water sources at a drinking water treatment plant over a one month period however submerged flat sheet nf membrane modules have not been applied in any previous study for wastewater recycling thus their applicability for treating water with high fouling substances remains unclear therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low permeate flux operation and a novel flat sheet submerged nf membrane module in the realization of the sustainable and low energy direct nanofiltration of wastewater the membrane fouling level as well as the quality of the recycled water were assessed over the course of a 48 d direct nf process involving secondary wastewater effluent the results obtained following the low permeate flux were also compared with those corresponding to a typical permeate flux 2 methods 2 1 feed solution this study used secondary

h after the stabilization step ro treated water was replaced by the secondary wastewater effluent and direct nf treatment was conducted over 48 d a constant permeate flux of 3 l m2h and a constant feed temperature of 25 c were maintained throughout the treatment period neither aeration nor stirring which are often applied for mitigating membrane fouling were intentionally applied to the membrane reservoir throughout the test to minimize energy consumption during direct nf treatment the volume of feed water in the membrane reservoir was maintained at 1 3 l by automatically supplementing the feed solution from the feed reservoir using a pump integrated with a level sensor the temperature of the wastewater stored in the feed reservoir was maintained below 7 c to minimize bacterial growth the temperature of the feed in the membrane reservoir was maintained at 25 c during the filtration every 6 d the feed solution in the membrane reservoir was discharged and replaced with fresh secondary wastewater effluent to avoid continuous accumulation of the rejected constituents approximately two fold concentration after 6 d operation the tmp was recorded every 24 h and 1 h after each replacement of feed solution in the membrane reservoir feed and permeate samples for water quality analysis were collected every 2 or 3 d at the end of the 48 d operation the membrane module was removed from the membrane reservoir thereafter the membrane surface was thoroughly and gently cleaned using a high quality polyurethane sponge ams 363h as one osaka japan and was rinsed with pure water after reinstalling the membrane module in the membrane reservoir the direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent was resumed and continued for the next 5 d the high flux experiment was carried out using the pressurized nf membrane treatment system the pressurized cross flow nf experiment was operated at a constant permeate flux of 40 l m2h and a constant temperature of 30 c for 48 h cross flow rate and cross flow velocity were maintained at 30 ml min and approximately 5 cm s respectively which resulted in a recovery rate of 8 throughout the test the feed and permeate solutions were recirculated into the feed reservoir samples for water quality analysis were collected after 1 h operation 2 4 analysis prior to the analysis of e254 and color each sample was

fouling 3 1 1 submerged nf treatment membrane fouling of the submerged nf system during direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent was evaluated for 48 d typical membrane based wastewater treatment requires continuous purging of a certain percentage of the concentrate to avoid concentration of rejected constituents in the membrane reservoir however only a limited volume of wastewater was available in this bench scale test in the laboratory thus the direct nf treatment was conducted in the dead end batch mode as noted in section 2 3 the feed solution in the membrane reservoir was replaced every 6 d to avoid excessive accumulation of substances rejected by the nf membrane in the membrane reservoir therefore tmp increase of the submerged nf system during typical operation of wastewater treatment where the concentrate is continuously discharged can be less than that in this study after commencing the direct nf treatment the tmp progressively increased until the feed solution in the membrane reservoir was replaced at 6 d fig 2 after the replacement of the feed solution the tmp dropped to a level close to that of the initial tmp similar trends in the tmp change over a 6 d filtration cycle were observed until 48 d the results indicate that the increased tmp was not due to irreversible membrane fouling the increased tmp during the filtration can be caused by multiple factors such as an increase in the osmotic pressure concentration polarization and reversible fouling for example an increase in osmotic pressure of the feed solution likely occurred due to the increase in the concentration of salts which were rejected by the nf membrane this was halted when the feed solutions in the membrane reservoir was replaced every 6 d in addition concentration polarization by the rejected ionic constituents could have been enhanced due to the increase in the concentration of organic and inorganic matter on the membrane surface further some foulants deposited on the membrane surface may have been detached from the membrane surface during the feed replacement for full scale operation with availability of a large volume of secondary wastewater effluent continuous operation can be possible by purging a small portion of the feed to avoid the increase in tmp to assess membrane fouling without the impact of the feed concentration the tmps that were recorded 1 h after the feed replacement were separately evaluated fig s2 the results indicated a minor but linear increase in tmp from 39 to 42 kpa over the 48 d treatment period based on the obtained linear regression formula the calculated fouling rate was 0 072 kpa d this indicates that the tmp after six months of operation can be predicted to reach 52 kpa which is equivalent to a permeability reduction of 22 in other words direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent at a permeate flux of 3 l m2h can be maintained without chemical cleaning during a six month period despite the marginal membrane fouling that occurred over 48 d physical cleaning using a polyurethane sponge was manually performed at the end of 48 d to provide understanding of membrane fouling mechanisms and evaluate the reversibility of the foulants the removal of the foulants from the membrane surface can also be confirmed through the recovery of tmp after the physical cleaning fig 2 the visual observation of the membrane surface before and after the sponge cleaning also revealed the near complete removal of foulants fig s3 in general pore blocking first occurs during the initial stage of membrane filtration which is followed by cake layer formation on the membrane surface 26 27 cleaning with a polyurethane sponge can only remove the foulants on the membrane surface 28 the recovery of permeability after the sponge cleaning indicates that most foulants contributing to the hydraulic resistance were present on the membrane surface therefore these results suggest that the removal of the cake layer by applying membrane surface cleaning e g sponge cleaning can be sufficient to achieve nearly full recovery of membrane permeability 3 1 2 pressurized nf treatment although the stable operation of the submerged nf system at a permeate flux of 3 l m2h was successfully demonstrated as shown in fig 2 it can be attributed to the low fouling propensity of the secondary wastewater effluent to demonstrate that direct nf treatment of secondary wastewater effluent at a typical permeate flux can cause significant membrane fouling the membrane fouling caused by secondary wastewater effluent under a typical permeate flux of 40 l m2h was evaluated using the pressurized nf system the initial tmp at t 0 was 0 55 mpa and the tmp progressively increased to 2 1 mpa at 48 h fig s4 the results indicate that direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent under typical nf operating conditions can promote fast and significant membrane fouling it is noted that no spacers were used on the membrane surface for the pressurized nf system to solely evaluate the impact of permeate flux in general chemical cleaning using caustic or acidic cleaning agents is conducted after confirming a 10 20 increase in the tmp or a 10 20 drop in the membrane permeability and the frequency of chemical cleaning at full scale water reclamation plants is between once every few months and once a year 29 the direct nf treatment in this study reached an 18 permeability drop from 7 3 6 0 l m2hbar within the first 4 h this indicates that under typical operating conditions chemical cleaning is required a few times a day when directly treating the secondary wastewater effluent which incurs considerable consumption of chemical agents a comparison in different permeate flux values between 3 and 40 l m2h in terms of the cumulative treated volume of water rather than the treatment time shows that the rate of tmp increase i e hydraulic resistance increase at a permeate flux of 40 l m2h was considerably greater than that of 3 l m2h fig 3 at a given cumulative treated water volume the membranes under 3 and 40 l m2h underwent the filtration of same feed volume the tmp under the permeate flux of 40 l m2h increased considerably from 0 55 to 2 1 mpa before reaching the cumulative treated water volume of 7 0 l in contrast the tmp under 3 l m2h permeate flux increased by only 2 for the same cumulative treated water volume therefore the results indicate that the deposition of foulants on the membrane can be enhanced at a higher permeate flux causing a faster increase in the hydraulic resistance it is noted that the feed water temperatures differed during the tests with different permeate fluxes the temperatures of the feed waters during tests with permeate fluxes of 3 and 40 l m2h were 25 c and 30 c respectively higher temperatures can reduce the required tmp because the viscosity of water decreases with increasing water temperature a previous study 30 reported that a 5 c difference in feed water temperature during nf treatment can cause a negligible difference therefore despite the difference in their temperature the feed waters can be expected to show similar overall trends in membrane fouling propensity in the two tests with differing permeate flux values the results align with a previous study 31 that reported the role of foulant transport between the bulk feed and the membrane surface by filtration and back diffusion and suggested that the permeate flux higher than a certain threshold flux can enhance foulant transport from the bulk feed to the membrane surface typical foulants in treated wastewater e g polysaccharides proteins and humic acid like substances which have molecular weights of 500 g mol and are larger than the pore size of typical nf membranes 32 can cause irreversible fouling by getting deposited on the membrane surface as a fouling layer 15 at a high tmp i e high permeate flux the compaction of the foulant layer can occur which can induce high hydraulic resistance 33 in fact the high permeate flux of 40 l m2h in this study caused an accelerated increase in hydraulic resistance i e tmp in a constant permeate flux operation fig 3 overall the results in this study indicate the superior performance of the low permeate flux for suppressing membrane fouling during direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent it should be noted that the trend of low membrane fouling propensity at a low permeate flux can be membrane specific the root mean square roughness and contact angle of the hydrapro 402 nf membrane surface was 14 6 7 2 nm and 45 1 respectively fig s5 these are relatively low among commercial nf membranes their root mean square roughness and contact angle are usually 10 60 nm and 30 90 respectively 34 36 in particular surface roughness has been reported to directly impact nf membrane permeability decline in membrane permeability increases with increasing surface roughness 34 therefore it is important to note that the fouling membrane propensity at a low permeate flux can vary depending on the chosen nf membranes in addition to feed water quality 3 2 water quality water quality during direct nf treatment using the submerged nf system was assessed over 48 d throughout the experiment water quality of the feed solution varied due to the dead end filtration and the subsequent concentration in the feed reservoir however the permeate was of good and stable quality over 48 d the color e254 and toc were 0 7 3 8 pcu 0 019 0 024 abs and 0 7 4 0 mg l respectively fig s6 similar observations were made for turbidity fig s7 the direct nf treatment achieved high rejection of color e254 and toc at over 93 84 and 67 respectively fig 4 the rejection values were similar to that at a permeate flux of 40 l m2h fig s8 indicating that operation at the low permeate flux did not compensate these water quality parameters these rejection values were comparable to those reported in previous studies using nf membranes after pre treatment 37 38 the high rejection of these water quality parameters by the nf membrane can be fundamentally attributed to the membrane tightness which governs size exclusion mechanisms 18 the membrane tightness can be represented by a membrane property called the molecular weight cut off mwco it is the lowest molecular weight which could belong to a solute which can be 90 rejected by the membrane the mwco of hydrapro 402 nf membrane was determined to be 200 g mol fig s9 which was equivalent to that of other commercial nf membranes they usually range from 200 to 500 g mol 39 the rejection of negatively charged compounds can also be enhanced by electrostatic repulsion the zeta potential of hydrapro 402 nf membrane in a solution of ph 6 and 8 was determined to be 20 mv fig s10 which was comparable to that of other commercial nf membranes they usually from 30 to 10 mv at ph 6 8 40 41 in contrast to these major water quality parameters electrical conductivity in the feed and permeate remained high at approximately 2 0 2 5 ms cm fig s6 accordingly the rejection of ions represented in conductivity removal remained stable but low at 8 14 fig 4 it should be noted that nf membranes including hydrapro 402 are not designed for the removal of major ions in wastewater monovalent ions including sodium and chloride ions and these ions can readily penetrate through the membrane pores therefore the rejection of nacl by the hydrapro 402 nf membrane decreased considerably nacl rejection at the permeate fluxes of 40 and 3 l m2h were 65 and 18 respectively while mgso4 rejection at permeate fluxes of 40 and 3 l m2h were 98 and 93 respectively fig s11 the impact of permeate flux on nacl rejection corresponds with a previous study 42 where water flux across the membrane decreased with decreasing permeate flux but solute flux including nacl flux across the membrane showed negligible changes with decreasing permeate flux which resulted in a higher solute concentration with a lower permeate flux based on the mechanisms described above low rejection at a low permeate flux e g 3 l m2h is a trend that is expected when other commercial nf membranes are used during direct nf treatment which can be a disadvantage of applying the low permeate flux during nf treatment organics in the nf permeate were further characterized to provide understanding of the variety of organics going through the membrane the eem fluorescence spectra of the secondary wastewater effluent in the membrane reservoir showed four major peaks fig 5a which included fluvic acid like fluorophore denoted as peak a at ex em of 225 260 nm 400 500 nm humic acid like fluorophore denoted as peak c at ex em of 300 370 nm 400 500 nm aromatic proteins denoted as peak b at ex em of 275 280 nm 305 321 nm and protein like substances denoted as peak t at ex em of 225 237 nm 340 381 nm 43 45 direct nf treatment considerably reduced the intensity of all peaks a b c and t fig 5b whereas the intensity of peaks b and c was relatively higher than that of peaks a and t aromatic proteins peak b are mainly composed of small organics such as tyrosine molecular weight 181 da thus they are likely to permeate through the pores of an nf membrane mwco of 200 da in contrast the molecular weights of humic acid like substances peak c in secondary wastewater effluent are relatively high in the range of 500 3000 da 46 whereas their small fractions may permeate through the membrane it should be noted that these humic like substances including aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds 47 can be the source of trihalomethane thm precursors which react with chlorine and form thms because the recycled water may be used for some water reuse applications that have potential for human contact the substantial removal of humic acid like substances by direct nf treatment can be critical for public health protection 3 3 full scale implications results from this study demonstrate the potential of direct nf treatment at a low permeate flux of 3 l m2h without any mixing and air bubbling in the membrane reservoir low tmp approximately 50 kpa operation could be maintained for six months without membrane cleaning fig s2 in addition the treated water quality except for monovalent ions was not compromised by the low permeate flux this suggests that direct advanced wastewater treatment without pre treatment using a submerged nf system can be achieved with considerably low energy consumption a major challenge of applying the low permeate flux is the necessity of large membrane surface areas to produce a specific volume of water which can result in a high capital cost and large footprint however unlike membrane bioreactor mbr direct nf treatment does not require aeration and mixing thus the fundamental membrane structure can be weaker than the submerged membranes used in mbr this allows engineers to design flexible membrane structures to further decrease manufacturing costs the feasibility of direct nf treatment will be explored by comparing the overall capital and operation costs of each option including those with pre treatment processes in our future study 4 conclusions this study evaluated the potential of direct nf treatment using a novel flat sheet submerged nf membrane module for achieving stable wastewater treatment operations and producing high quality recycled water direct nf treatment of secondary wastewater effluent at a low permeate flux of 3 l m2h resulted in negligible membrane fouling with a tmp increase of 3 kpa over 48 d thus demonstrating the advantage of the low permeate flux for suppressing membrane fouling membrane fouling was reversible with sponge cleaning nearly full removal of foulants from the membrane surface and full recovery of permeability were observed direct nf treatment was capable of high rejection of color e254 and toc by 93 84 and 67

supplementing the feed solution from the feed reservoir using a pump integrated with a level sensor the temperature of the wastewater stored in the feed reservoir was maintained below 7 c to minimize bacterial growth the temperature of the feed in the membrane reservoir was maintained at 25 c during the filtration every 6 d the feed solution in the membrane reservoir was discharged and replaced with fresh secondary wastewater effluent to avoid continuous accumulation of the rejected constituents approximately two fold concentration after 6 d operation the tmp was recorded every 24 h and 1 h after each replacement of feed solution in the membrane reservoir feed and permeate samples for water quality analysis were collected every 2 or 3 d at the end of the 48 d operation the membrane module was removed from the membrane reservoir thereafter the membrane surface was thoroughly and gently cleaned using a high quality polyurethane sponge ams 363h as one osaka japan and was rinsed with pure water after reinstalling the membrane module in the membrane reservoir the direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent was resumed and continued for the next 5 d the high flux experiment was carried out using the pressurized nf membrane treatment system the pressurized cross flow nf experiment was operated at a constant permeate flux of 40 l m2h and a constant temperature of 30 c for 48 h cross flow rate and cross flow velocity were maintained at 30 ml min and approximately 5 cm s respectively which resulted in a recovery rate of 8 throughout the test the feed and permeate solutions were recirculated into the feed reservoir samples for water quality analysis were collected after 1 h operation 2 4 analysis prior to the analysis of e254 and color each sample was pre filtrated using a 0 45 μm filter whatman merck japan tokyo japan the e254 and color of each sample were analyzed using a spectrophotometer uv1280 shimadzu kyoto japan at wavelengths of 455 nm and 254 nm respectively in accordance with the usepa method 415 3 quartz sample cuvettes with lengths 10 and 50 mm were used for the analysis of e254 and color respectively the conductivity and ph of each sample was directly measured using a conductivity meter orion star a325 thermo fisher scientific ma usa and a ph meter mm 41dp dkk toa corporation tokyo japan respectively toc was analyzed without pre filtration using a toc vsh analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan and the non purgeable organic carbon method turbidity of each sample was determined using a turbidity meter 2100q hach loveland co usa in accordance with the usepa method 180 1 turbidity of the permeate was measured after leaving the sample to stand for 5 min to eliminate air bubbles dissolved organics in feed and permeate water were characterized on the day 46th by using the excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra by fluorescence spectroscopy rf 6000 shimadzu kyoto japan 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane fouling 3 1 1 submerged nf treatment membrane fouling of the submerged nf system during direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent was evaluated for 48 d typical membrane based wastewater treatment requires continuous purging of a certain percentage of the concentrate to avoid concentration of rejected constituents in the membrane reservoir however only a limited volume of wastewater was available in this bench scale test in the laboratory thus the direct nf treatment was conducted in the dead end batch mode as noted in section 2 3 the feed solution in the membrane reservoir was replaced every 6 d to avoid excessive accumulation of substances rejected by the nf membrane in the membrane reservoir therefore tmp increase of the submerged nf system during typical operation of wastewater treatment where the concentrate is continuously discharged can be less than that in this study after commencing the direct nf treatment the tmp progressively increased until the feed solution in the membrane reservoir was replaced at 6 d fig 2 after the replacement of the feed solution the tmp dropped to a level close to that of the initial tmp similar trends in the tmp change over a 6 d filtration cycle were observed until 48 d the results indicate that the increased tmp was not due to irreversible membrane fouling the increased tmp during the filtration can be caused by multiple factors such as an increase in the osmotic pressure concentration polarization and reversible fouling for example an increase in osmotic pressure of the feed solution likely occurred due to the increase in the concentration of salts which were rejected by the nf membrane this was halted when the feed solutions in the membrane reservoir was replaced every 6 d in addition concentration polarization by the rejected ionic constituents could have been enhanced due to the increase in the concentration of organic and inorganic matter on the membrane surface further some foulants deposited on the membrane surface may have been detached from the membrane surface during the feed replacement for full scale operation with availability of a large volume of secondary wastewater effluent continuous operation can be possible by purging a small portion of the feed to avoid the increase in tmp to assess membrane fouling without the impact of the feed concentration the tmps that were recorded 1 h after the feed replacement were separately evaluated fig s2 the results indicated a minor but linear increase in tmp from 39 to 42 kpa over the 48 d treatment period based on the obtained linear regression formula the calculated fouling rate was 0 072 kpa d this indicates that the tmp after six months of operation can be predicted to reach 52 kpa which is equivalent to a permeability reduction of 22 in other words direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent at a permeate flux of 3 l m2h can be maintained without chemical cleaning during a six month period despite the marginal membrane fouling that occurred over 48 d physical cleaning using a polyurethane sponge was manually performed at the end of 48 d to provide understanding of membrane fouling mechanisms and evaluate the reversibility of the foulants the removal of the foulants from the membrane surface can also be confirmed through the recovery of tmp after the physical cleaning fig 2 the visual observation of the membrane surface before and after the sponge cleaning also revealed the near complete removal of foulants fig s3 in general pore blocking first occurs during the initial stage of membrane filtration which is followed by cake layer formation on the membrane surface 26 27 cleaning with a polyurethane sponge can only remove the foulants on the membrane surface 28 the recovery of permeability after the sponge cleaning indicates that most foulants contributing to the hydraulic resistance were present on the membrane surface therefore these results suggest that the removal of the cake layer by applying membrane surface cleaning e g sponge cleaning can be sufficient to achieve nearly full recovery of membrane permeability 3 1 2 pressurized nf treatment although the stable operation of the submerged nf system at a permeate flux of 3 l m2h was successfully demonstrated as shown in fig 2 it can be attributed to the low fouling propensity of the secondary wastewater effluent to demonstrate that direct nf treatment of secondary wastewater effluent at a typical permeate flux can cause significant membrane fouling the membrane fouling caused by secondary wastewater effluent under a typical permeate flux of 40 l m2h was evaluated using the pressurized nf system the initial tmp at t 0 was 0 55 mpa and the tmp progressively increased to 2 1 mpa at 48 h fig s4 the results indicate that direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent under typical nf operating conditions can promote fast and significant membrane fouling it is noted that no spacers were used on the membrane surface for the pressurized nf system to solely evaluate the impact of permeate flux in general chemical cleaning using caustic or acidic cleaning agents is conducted after confirming a 10 20 increase in the tmp or a 10 20 drop in the membrane permeability and the frequency of chemical cleaning at full scale water reclamation plants is between once every few months and once a year 29 the direct nf treatment in this study reached an 18 permeability drop from 7 3 6 0 l m2hbar within the first 4 h this indicates that under typical operating conditions chemical cleaning is required a few times a day when directly treating the secondary wastewater effluent which incurs considerable consumption of chemical agents a comparison in different permeate flux values between 3 and 40 l m2h in terms of the cumulative treated volume of water rather than the treatment time shows that the rate of tmp increase i e hydraulic resistance increase at a permeate flux of 40 l m2h was considerably greater than that of 3 l m2h fig 3 at a given cumulative treated water volume the membranes under 3 and 40 l m2h underwent the filtration of same feed volume the tmp under the permeate flux of 40 l m2h increased considerably from 0 55 to 2 1 mpa before reaching the cumulative treated water volume of 7 0 l in contrast the tmp under 3 l m2h permeate flux increased by only 2 for the same cumulative treated water volume therefore the results indicate that the deposition of foulants on the membrane can be enhanced at a higher permeate flux causing a faster increase in the hydraulic resistance it is noted that the feed water temperatures differed during the tests with different permeate fluxes the temperatures of the feed waters during tests with permeate fluxes of 3 and 40 l m2h were 25 c and 30 c respectively higher temperatures can reduce the required tmp because the viscosity of water decreases with increasing water temperature a previous study 30 reported that a 5 c difference in feed water temperature during nf treatment can cause a negligible difference therefore despite the difference in their temperature the feed waters can be expected to show similar overall trends in membrane fouling propensity in the two tests with differing permeate flux values the results align with a previous study 31 that reported the role of foulant transport between the bulk feed and the membrane surface by filtration and back diffusion and suggested that the permeate flux higher than a certain threshold flux can enhance foulant transport from the bulk feed to the membrane surface typical foulants in treated wastewater e g polysaccharides proteins and humic acid like substances which have molecular weights of 500 g mol and are larger than the pore size of typical nf membranes 32 can cause irreversible fouling by getting deposited on the membrane surface as a fouling layer 15 at a high tmp i e high permeate flux the compaction of the foulant layer can occur which can induce high hydraulic resistance 33 in fact the high permeate flux of 40 l m2h in this study caused an accelerated increase in hydraulic resistance i e tmp in a constant permeate flux operation fig 3 overall the results in this study indicate the superior performance of the low permeate flux for suppressing membrane fouling during direct nf treatment of the secondary wastewater effluent it should be noted that the trend of low membrane fouling propensity at a low permeate flux can be membrane specific the root mean square roughness and contact angle of the hydrapro 402 nf membrane surface was 14 6 7 2 nm and 45 1 respectively fig s5 these are relatively low among commercial nf membranes their root mean square roughness and contact angle are usually 10 60 nm and 30 90 respectively 34 36 in particular surface roughness has been reported to directly impact nf membrane permeability decline in membrane permeability increases with increasing surface roughness 34 therefore it is important to note that the fouling membrane propensity at a low permeate flux can vary depending on the chosen nf membranes in addition to feed water quality 3 2 water quality water quality during direct nf treatment using the submerged nf system was assessed over 48 d throughout the experiment water quality of the feed solution varied due to the dead end filtration and the subsequent concentration in the feed reservoir however the permeate was of good and stable quality over 48 d the color e254 and toc were 0 7 3 8 pcu 0 019 0 024 abs and 0 7 4 0 mg l respectively fig s6 similar observations were made for turbidity fig s7 the direct nf treatment achieved high rejection of color e254 and toc at over 93 84 and 67 respectively fig 4 the rejection values were similar to that at a permeate flux of 40 l m2h fig s8 indicating that operation at the low permeate flux did not compensate these water quality parameters these rejection values were comparable to those reported in previous studies using nf membranes after pre treatment 37 38 the high rejection of these water quality parameters by the nf membrane can be fundamentally attributed to the membrane tightness which governs size exclusion mechanisms 18 the membrane tightness can be represented by a membrane property called the molecular weight cut off mwco it is the lowest molecular weight which could belong to a solute which can be 90 rejected by the membrane the mwco of hydrapro 402 nf membrane was determined to be 200 g mol fig s9 which was equivalent to that of other commercial nf membranes they usually range from 200 to 500 g mol 39 the rejection of negatively charged compounds can also be enhanced by electrostatic repulsion the zeta potential of hydrapro 402 nf membrane in a solution of ph 6 and 8 was determined to be 20 mv fig s10 which was comparable to that of other commercial nf membranes they usually from 30 to 10 mv at ph 6 8 40 41 in contrast to these major water quality parameters electrical conductivity in the feed and permeate remained high at approximately 2 0 2 5 ms cm fig s6 accordingly the rejection of ions represented in conductivity removal remained stable but low at 8 14 fig 4 it should be noted that nf membranes including hydrapro 402 are not designed for the removal of major ions in wastewater monovalent ions including sodium and chloride ions and these ions can readily penetrate through the membrane pores therefore the rejection of nacl by the hydrapro 402 nf membrane decreased considerably nacl rejection at the permeate fluxes of 40 and 3 l m2h were 65 and 18 respectively while mgso4 rejection at permeate fluxes of 40 and 3 l m2h were 98 and 93 respectively fig s11 the impact of permeate flux on nacl rejection corresponds with a previous study 42 where water flux across the membrane decreased with decreasing permeate flux but solute flux including nacl flux across the membrane showed negligible changes with decreasing permeate flux which resulted in a higher solute concentration with a lower permeate flux based on the mechanisms described above low rejection at a low permeate flux e g 3 l m2h is a trend that is expected when other commercial nf membranes are used during direct nf treatment which can be a disadvantage of applying the low permeate flux during nf treatment organics in the nf permeate were further characterized to provide understanding of the variety of organics going through the membrane the eem fluorescence spectra of the secondary wastewater effluent in the membrane reservoir showed four major peaks fig 5a which included fluvic acid like fluorophore denoted as peak a at ex em of 225 260 nm 400 500 nm humic acid like fluorophore denoted as peak c at ex em of 300 370 nm 400 500 nm aromatic proteins denoted as peak b at ex em of 275 280 nm 305 321 nm and protein like substances denoted as peak t at ex em of 225 237 nm 340 381 nm 43 45 direct nf treatment considerably reduced the intensity of all peaks a b c and t fig 5b whereas the intensity of peaks b and c was relatively higher than that of peaks a and t aromatic proteins peak b are mainly composed of small organics such as tyrosine molecular weight 181 da thus they are likely to permeate through the pores of an nf membrane mwco of 200 da in contrast the molecular weights of humic acid like substances peak c in secondary wastewater effluent are relatively high in the range of 500 3000 da 46 whereas their small fractions may permeate through the membrane it should be noted that these humic like substances including aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds 47 can be the source of trihalomethane thm precursors which react with chlorine and form thms because the recycled water may be used for some water reuse applications that have potential for human contact the substantial removal of humic acid like substances by direct nf treatment can be critical for public health protection 3 3 full scale implications results from this study demonstrate the potential of direct nf treatment at a low permeate flux of 3 l m2h without any mixing and air bubbling in the membrane reservoir low tmp approximately 50 kpa operation could be maintained for six months without membrane cleaning fig s2 in addition the treated water quality except for monovalent ions was not compromised by the low permeate flux this suggests that direct advanced wastewater treatment without pre treatment using a submerged nf system can be achieved with considerably low energy consumption a major challenge of applying the low permeate flux is the necessity of large membrane surface areas to produce a specific volume of water which can result in a high capital cost and large footprint however unlike membrane bioreactor mbr direct nf treatment does not require aeration and mixing thus the fundamental membrane structure can be weaker than the submerged membranes used in mbr this allows engineers to design flexible membrane structures to further decrease manufacturing costs the feasibility of direct nf treatment will be explored by comparing the overall capital and operation costs of each option including those with pre treatment processes in our future study 4 conclusions this study evaluated the potential of direct nf treatment using a novel flat sheet submerged nf membrane module for achieving stable wastewater treatment operations and producing high quality recycled water direct nf treatment of secondary wastewater effluent at a low permeate flux of 3 l m2h resulted in negligible membrane fouling with a tmp increase of 3 kpa over 48 d thus demonstrating the advantage of the low permeate flux for suppressing membrane fouling membrane fouling was reversible with sponge cleaning nearly full removal of foulants from the membrane surface and full recovery of permeability were observed direct nf treatment was capable of high rejection of color e254 and toc by 93 84 and 67

13511,fly ash fa is the by product of coal combustion which is known to be an environmental pollutant india produces about 221 million tons of coal fly ash annually a large area is required for the disposal of fly ash as it can cause secondary land and water pollution improper disposal of fly ash has become a common issue and caused a waste of a lot of resources however coal fly ash has proven its worth and today fly ash due to its cementitious properties is widely used in cement production and it is also a promising adsorbent for water treatment fly ash was studied effectively for the removal of various pollutants from wastewater the chemical and pozzolanic properties make fly ash very useful for water remediation phenols and substituted phenols dyes including methylene blue mb methyl orange mo etc heavy metal ions like hg cu cr as pb etc pesticides and many other organic and inorganic ions like fluoride and phosphate are present in wastewater these pollutants can be removed by adsorption process using fly ash in this paper different adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics used for the removal of various contaminants from wastewater are also discussed photocatalytic property and various ways of utilizing fly ash and modified fly ash for wastewater treatment are also discussed in this paper lastly future research and prospects for the utilization of fly ash for water remediation are also highlighted keywords adsorbent fly ash dyes adsorption isotherm heavy metal ions zeolites geopolymers 1 introduction coal fly ash cfa or pulverized fly ash is the powdered mineral residue generated as a by product of coal burning in the thermal power plants the temperature of the combustion process may be as high as 2000 c most of the inorganic material in the coal gets melted and fused at such high temperatures in india 73 of electricity is produced by thermal power plants out of which 90 are based on coal combustion about 221 million tons of cfa is produced annually from which only about 60 is utilized and the rest is dumped in the ash ponds finding of disposal site and unproductive use of land discourages the disposal of fly ash the utilization of cfa has increased from 6 64 million tons to 107 10 million tons in 2017 which is 63 28 of the total cfa produced cfa was considered as an industrial pollutant until the last decade due to its ability to pollute the environment 1 the chemical composition of fly ash depends upon the type of coal and combustion temperature alumina hematite silica oxides of calcium magnesium sodium potassium and titanium are the major constituents of cfa the presence of heavy metals such as mercury cadmium arsenic cobalt copper lead chromium etc results in the toxicity of fly ash indian coal is of poor quality due to its low calorific value and high ash content resulting in an excessive amount of cfa it is not very easy to utilize low grade coal because of some undesirable properties such as higher moisture content high ash content and the presence of a high amount of sulphur 2 lignite is the most abundant form of coal estimated to be more than 4 trillion tones around the globe 3 and both lignite and sub bituminous coals constitute about 45 of the total coal reserve 4 in the past years the industrial revolution has led to the development of industries which resulted in several environmental issues including damage to the plants and animal ecosystems with harmful effects on human health 5 7 textile leather paint and plastic industries release effluents and are the major cause of water pollution dyes and pigments are resistant to biological oxidation and responsible for high bod biological oxygen demand of water samples when released into the water streams they imposed serious environmental problems by blocking the amount of sunlight reaching the underwater ecosystem 8 leather paint steel and electroplating industries are the sources of heavy metal ions such as lead mercury arsenic copper nickel cobalt etc in wastewater 9 for instance in a study it was estimated that asia releases 69 of the total mercury in the environment just by coal combustion in the year 2010 10 when accumulated in humans through seafood these heavy metals result in low blood pressure brain damage edema and even cancer at high concentrations copper and cobalt are essential for growth and development of the body at a lower concentrations however at a higher concentrations can cause liver damage goiter anemia and insomnia petroleum refining industries produce a large amount of wastewater containing high amounts of non biodegradable pollutants like metal ions phenolic compounds sulphides ammonia and oils 11 12 in a recent research reported by bahri et al 13 the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater produced by abadan petrochemical refinery was reported to be extremely high 20 000 mg o2 l this wastewater is released into the persian gulf causing severe health problems to the nearby inhabitants and destroying the natural ecosystem if not treated properly with the development of science and technology cfa is emerging as a potential raw material for various industrial applications the potential applications of cfa include its utilization as a fertilizer in agriculture highway embankment construction of bricks cement mine filling production of ceramics and zeolites adsorbent for gases and pollutants from wastewater among various methods used for the removal of contaminants such as coagulation chemical oxidation electrolytic precipitation and microfiltration adsorption has remained an economical and simple method for wastewater treatment 14 materials with larger surface area and greater pore size may act as excellent adsorbents physical properties like greater surface area and high porosity make cfa an excellent low cost adsorbent for removing toxic heavy metals and dyes from wastewater recently the production of zeolites and geopolymers from cfa for wastewater treatment has gained much importance due to the high adsorption capacity and ion exchange property of cfa zeolites they are widely examined for wastewater treatment for example javadian et al 15 investigated zeolite based geopolymer synthesized from cfa via the hydrothermal method to remove cd ii ions from wastewater and examined various factors affecting the adsorption of cadmium ions the prepared geopolymer was effective in removing 96 of the cadmium after 7 h of contact time under optimum ph of 5 initial concentration of 10 mg l and catalyst dosage of 0 08 g in 25 ml of solution the adsorption kinetic study showed that the process followed a pseudo second order reaction and the data best fitted the langmuir isothermal model fig 1 shows the percentage of fly ash utilized in different sectors today about 10 20 of total fly ash is used for construction purposes as an additive for cement production 16 18 due to the presence of cao and good water retention properties class c fly ash is used for soil treatment and for maintaining the ph of the soil 19 20 low grade cfa is highly available and an excellent source of aluminosilicates and used as a raw material for the production of geopolymers zeolites and various fly ash based photocatalysts for wastewater treatment 21 it is also used for the adsorption of carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur from the air 22 23 the utilization of coal fly ash for wastewater treatment is an impressive way to cope up with this by product which otherwise is a major problem for several countries 24 there are various research articles published addressing the utilization of cfa as a low cost adsorbent for wastewater treatment but most of the papers just focused on the removal of heavy metals or organic dyes only a few papers highlighted the removal of other organic compounds like pesticides and pharmaceutical products this review tries to summarize the advantages of cfa and other adsorbents like zeolites and geopolymers derived from cfa as low cost adsorbents for the removal of a wide range of pollutants including dyes heavy metals pesticides and pharmaceutical compounds the use of cfa as a photocatalyst for the degradation of dyes is also highlighted in this paper this article aims to provide an environmentally friendly method to utilize fly ash for wastewater treatment it is worth mentioning that the term fly ash refers to the fly ash produced by the combustion of coal the perspectives for further research and some other ways of utilizing fly ash are also mentioned in this article 2 concerns of thermal power plant a air pollution coal combustion results in the production of several air pollutants like oxides of sulphur and nitrogen and carbon monoxide when mixed with water vapours these pollutants produce acid rain which leads to serious health problems in humans as well as in animal and plant kingdom b water pollution cooling tower produces a large amount of wastewater in thermal power plants the water may be reused post treatment or can be disposed into a water source when the water is discharged without treatment it can alter the chemical constituents of freshwater and thermal pollution affects the average water temperature in turn disturbing the aquatic life c ash handling and disposal disposal of cfa in the ash ponds is one of the major causes of air pollution water pollution and land pollution in a nearby area a large amount of valuable land area is wasted in the disposal of fly ash which otherwise can be used for agriculture or farming if ash ponds are left open uncovered fly ash become dry and rises in the air increasing the particulate matter in the air d problems related to fly ash cfa a potent air pollutant is a powdered substance which travels with air and if inhaled can cause severe lung problems if fly ash settles in farming land it can reduce the yield of the crop ash ponds require large landmass for ash disposal this reduces the land area available for other purposes conversion of fly ash into slurry for disposal also requires colossal water consumption various heavy metals and pollutants can percolate in the ground and freshwater from ash ponds and pollute it 3 collection of cfa after the combustion of coal the bottom 20 of ash is called bottom ash and the rest 80 is conveyed as pulverized fly ash bottom ash is disposed of in the slurry form for removing dust from flue gases by using mechanical or electrical methods fabric filters are used as mechanical collection devices and electrostatic precipitator is used as an electrical method to collect fly ash electrostatic precipitator esp is a tool for collecting fly ash with an efficiency of 99 esps have low operating costs and economically viable 4 characteristics of cfa fly ash is powdery material with a greyish colour and is alkaline in nature siliceous and aluminous inorganic compounds in fly ash are called pozzolans because when it comes in contact with water and quick lime it forms cement like products cfa is a mixture of both micro and macronutrients potassium phosphorus calcium magnesium zinc iron copper manganese boron and molybdenum are generally present in the fly ash the geotechnical properties of cfa are mostly used in the construction of roads and its pozzolan properties make it useful for manufacturing cement and other building material like bricks fly ash with high silicon content is excellent for making zeolites and alum 26 cfa is an excellent adsorbent for wastewater treatment because of its essential physiochemical properties such as bulk density greater surface area and small size of particles high porosity and water holding capacity from the viewpoint of thermal power plants cfa is a waste however other industries like cement production might use it as a binding agent studies are being carried out for developing new methods for the sustainable use of cfa in agriculture and engineering 27 28 preparation of zeolites from cfa is also an interesting topic for future research 29 cfa can also be utilized as a cheap adsorbent for different pollutants in treating wastewater different aspects of cfa to adsorb pollutants from wastewater are discussed in this paper 5 classes and composition of cfa cfa is broadly classified into two categories i e class f fly ash and class c fly ash according to astm c 618 the main difference in the two categories is the varying amount of calcium alumina silica and hematite present the quality anthracite bituminous sub bituminous and lignite and the geographical region from where the coal comes also influence the chemical properties of cfa the chemical composition of cfa changes according to the composition of coal broadly the chemical composition of cfa can be given as silica 60 65 alumina 25 30 and magnetite 6 15 1 a class f fly ash fly ash formed by burning of anthracite and bituminous coal where the amount of lime present is below 10 and the total content of sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 is higher than 70 wt is called class f fly ash the higher pozzolanic properties require cementing agents such as quick lime and water to give cementitious compounds geopolymers are produced by the addition of chemical activators na2sio3 to class f fly ash b class c fly ash fly ash produced by the combustion of low quality coal like lignite and sub bituminous where the amount of lime present is greater than 20 and the total content of sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 is in the range of 50 70 wt is known as class c fly ash the content of alkali and sulfates are generally higher and it is less pozzolanic than class f fly ash due to this there is no need for chemical activators the properties of a cfa sample are shown in table 1 6 properties of cfa it is essential to examine the different characteristics of cfa such as chemical composition mineralogy surface chemistry and reactivity for its potential applications 6 1 physical properties cfa is a powdery substance where particles are mostly spherical porous and generally amorphous in nature the particle size of bituminous cfa is less than 0 075 nm on the other hand cfa of sub bituminous coal is rough and larger than that of bituminous cfa the specific gravity of most of the cfa is in between 2 1 3 0 but the surface area may vary largely from 170 to 1000 m2 kg 31 34 the carbon content produces a blackish colour to the fly ash 6 2 chemical properties the methods of handling and storage and composition of coal largely influence the chemical properties of cfa coal is classified into anthracite bituminous sub bituminous and lignite each varying in calorific value chemical composition ash content and heating value silica alumina magnetite calcium and carbon are the main components of bituminous cfa lignite and sub bituminous cfa contain a higher amount of cao and mgo less concentration of silica and magnetite and lower unburned carbon content than that of bituminous cfa anthracite is the purest form of coal that is not burned in thermal power plants and therefore only a small amount of anthracite cfa is available the usual range of the chemical composition of different types of cfa is shown in table 2 the mineralogy of cfa is studied by the x ray diffraction method the principal mineral phases used are quartz kaolinite illite and siderite calcite pyrite and hematite are less predominant in coal the xrd pattern of cfa is shown in fig 2 the major peaks are due to the presence of quartz and smaller peaks indicate amorphous phases alumino silicates of spherical shape is of the size between 1 15 μm as shown in fig 3 36 7 biomass ash the utilization of biomass as a fuel produces more fly ash causing environmental pollution however in contrast to the coal fly ash toxic heavy metals are not present in the biomass ash the composition of biomass ash depends upon the class of biomass soil mineralogy and method of handling 37 generally the common elements present in biomass fuels which results in the generation of fly ash are calcium sodium potassium silicon and phosphorus among these calcium sodium phosphorus and potassium are nutrients for biomass 36 some biomass like rice husk is rich in silicon content while wood has a high alkali metal content the elemental composition of biomass ash depends on the combustion technique used for its production mostly clean biomass combustion generates fly ash containing high alkali and less alumina as compared to cfa 37 39 biomass ash shows a wide variation in composition and concentration of inorganic components than coal fly ash which depends on the origin and type of plant moreover even the same type of biomass shows a more substantial variation in composition depending upon weather season and storage methods 37 41 various types of biomass ash derived from rice husk wood wheat and cane straw showed same pozzolanic properties as compared to that of cfa 42 44 rice husk fly ash has a higher silica content and therefore is used in the cement manufacture as an insulator and substitute to silica 45 8 utilization of fly ash there are several advantages of utilizing fly ash some of these are i wastage of money in the disposal of fly ash can be saved ii minimal waste of land for disposal thus the land can be used in other ways and iii fly ash is a by product and reusing by product can save natural resources fly ash utilization includes an additive in cement manufacturing insulator utilization in construction of roads and construction material as a lightweight aggregate in mine filling and for treating wastewater and many more the utilization of fly ash for the treatment remediation of wastewater is discussed below 9 treatment of wastewater using cfa there are different ways for wastewater treatment however mostly they are expensive and not applicable for industrial applications utilization of fly ash as a low cost adsorbent for wastewater treatment has proven to be one of the most economic and successful method utilization of cfa for the removal of toxic metals colour dyes and organic compounds are discussed below 9 1 removal of toxic metals the utilization of cfa for the treatment of wastewater has gained much attention recently the presence of unburned carbon and physical properties such as porosity greater surface area and small particle size makes cfa an excellent low cost adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater the alkaline nature of cfa imparts neutralizing property while the oxides such as alumina silica calcium oxide and iron oxides present in fly ash adsorb toxic heavy metals from wastewater to increase the heavy metal adsorption efficiency the ph of the solution is increased by using lime and sodium hydroxide 46 47 summary of different toxic metals adsorbed on fly ash are given in table 3 nowadays heavy metals toxicity has become a serious problem for public health chemical paint and pesticide manufacturing industries are the major sources of heavy metals in water several chemical and physical methods like solvent extraction precipitation adsorption and reverse osmosis are carried out for removing toxic metals from water however these methods are typical and costly among these adsorption has emerged as an economical and effective method gangoli et al reported the use of cfa for adsorption of toxic metals in 1975 nickel chromium lead arsenic copper cadmium and mercury are most widely studied 48 other researchers also studied the removal of cr 6 and cr 3 using cfa from

that the adsorption efficiency can be increased by reducing the particle size of fly ash lime content also influences the adsorption of dye to some extent 127 130 a study revealed that the dye adsorption efficiency decreases in the presence of other organic components like methanol and acetone oppositely charged surfactants also affect the dye adsorption process low concentration of surfactant promotes sorption but a high concentration of surfactant helps dye molecules to remain in the solution other inorganic components in fa have less effect on adsorption 131 another study showed that bottom fly ash was capable of removing 87 5 of alizarin yellow and 97 of fast green 145 11 4 1 dye removal by surface modified fly ash the adsorptive dye removal efficiency of fa can be improved by its surface modifications fly ash was treated with quaternary ammonium cations for the removal of dyes from wastewater and aqueous solutions structure and size of the cation affects the adsorption capacity 146 adsorption of r6g and mg was investigated by chemically modified fly ash and rate order kinetics were reported 147 the study revealed adsorption of r6g and mg occurs through weak forces and dye structure and adsorbent surface also influenced the adsorption capacity the adsorption data indicates pseudo second order kinetic because the results show similarity to langmuir

zeolite synthesized from fly ash was investigated for the removal of ammonium and phosphate ions from dilute solutions 150 concentrated sulphuric acid destroyed the structure of the zeolite and decreased the ca2 changing efficiency treatment with 0 01 m h2so4 increases the phosphate removal tendency while treating the zeolite with h2so4 with a concentration higher than 0 9 m leads to limited phosphate mobilization property zfa with ca mg al fe and na as counter ions was examined for removing phosphate ions from water 151 al3 zfa showed maximum phosphate removal efficiency of 80 98

z alo2 n wh2o where z is the molar ratio of si al m is an alkali metal cation and w is the water content 157 fig 9 shows the steps for the production of geopolymer from fly ash 157 geopolymers were used for the removal of toxic metals and dyes from water the adsorption results show similarity with the langmuir adsorption model and indicated pseudo second order kinetics the adsorption process is spontaneous and controlled by entropy 158 159 geopolymer was examined for removing detergent from wastewater 160 geopolymer surface is cationic at ph 7 and anionic at ph 7 detergents are anionic and best adsorbed at a ph of 2 detergents are attracted to the geopolymer surface through electrostatic forces of attraction geopolymer could be used for the manufacturing of geopolymer pipes for water circulation as the heavy metals get adsorbed automatically 14 mechanism of adsorption and chemical kinetics for the adsorption of a liquid on a solid surface the transfer of solute depends on external mass transfer interparticle diffusion or both of them the mechanism of adsorption process involves three steps i movement of solute particles towards adsorbent surface present in the solution ii then the solute particles are diffused onto the pores of adsorbent and a small amount of solute gets adsorbed on the surface iii solute adsorption on the pores and capillaries of inner interfaces of the adsorbent the third step is assumed to be in equilibrium with surface adsorption and is neglected generally the pore diffusion of surface diffusion is considered as the slow and rate determining step lagergren pseudo first order kinetics external and interparticle diffusion model and pseudo second order kinetics are generally investigated for studying the adsorption kinetics the equations

order kinetics 112 138 147 15 adsorption isotherms the adsorption data of dyes and heavy metal ions on cfa indicates that the adsorption process is generally represented by the freundlich and langmuir isotherms the langmuir isotherms are applicable for the adsorption on homogenous surfaces and the interactions between the adsorbed molecules are ignored the langmuir equation for a single component system is given by 5 x m v m k c e 1 k c e the above equation can be linearized as 6 e x m 1 k v m c e v m where ce is the concentration of the solution at equilibrium x m is the amount of solute

ash was investigated as an effective photocatalyst for the degradation of acid red 1 in water 165 in a study wang et al 166 reported that cfa based photocatalysts are strong oxidizing agents because they produce hydroxyl radicals in water to degrade large organic molecules fly ash was modified with cuo to increase the adsorption of visible light by cfa based photocatalyst cuo shifted the bandgap energy from 1 2 ev to 2 09 ev it took 40 min for the cuo fly ash to degrade 99 1 of methyl orange 167 to improve the adsorption capacity of photocatalyst and to increase the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment fa can be blended with a conductive polymer the presence of nanocomposite increases the adsorption efficiency and as the photocatalyst gets saturated with adsorbate it gets coagulated 168 16 1 mechanism of photodegradation mechanism of photodegradation involves five main steps i photoexcitation ii ionization of water iii oxidation and reduction iv protonation of

ho2 and oh 170 17 future research and prospects for the utilization of fly ash fa has potential applications for the removal of various organic and inorganic pollutants from water researchers have paid more attention in this direction because of the excellent adsorption capacity of fly ash and its large scale availability without cost fly ash was used as an economic adsorbent in place of activated carbon for wastewater treatment adsorption capacity of fly ash can be increased by modifying fly ash with suitable materials and methods inorganic components in fly ash make it useful for the synthesis of zeolite and geopolymers which can further be used for water treatment fly ash has various nutrients such as magnesium potassium calcium boron iron sulphur copper phosphorus and zinc which are essential for plant growth thus fly ash can be an alternative to chemical fertilizers used in the agriculture industry previously it has been used in place of lime for maintaining the ph of the soil studies claim that fly ash also has the pesticidal removal properties due to the presence of silica which could kill insects 171 there is a lesser information available for the utilization of fly ash as a low cost fertilizer therefore more research should be conducted in this area most of the researchers studied the adsorption of phenol dye and pesticide concerning initial ph in a single pollutant system but no studies were reported for the adsorption of phenol dye and pesticide with varying ph during the reaction and in the presence of other contaminants like heavy metal ions and other organic compounds in a multi pollutant system the comparison of adsorption efficiency depend not only the parameters related to the experimental conditions and the effluent but also on the analytical method used for decontamination tests batch method column reactors etc thus a direct comparison of data obtained using various low cost adsorbents is difficult because of inconsistencies in the data presentation hence more efforts should be attempted in this direction the adsorption data were fitted with either the langmuir model or the freundlich model there are very few papers available about the adsorption of pollutants according to net bet isotherm it is also found that most of the adsorption experiments were performed only in the lab scale under batch mode of operation therefore more studies need to be carried out in the column flow adsorption system for its practical applications the adsorption data obtained from the literature must be used to develop new fly ash based low costs adsorbents which can be used at an industrial level more research should be conducted to test the developed fly ash based low cost adsorbents with real wastewater there are very fewer data available about the reproducibility of adsorption results the adsorbent must be physically and chemically stable reproducibility of adsorption data is important for an adsorbent material to be used at a pilot plant level however very less information is available in this direction therefore more research should be conducted in these areas the utilization of coal fly ash as a sole or supported photocatalyst for the degradation of dyes and other organic compounds from water phase is a comparatively new area of research coal fly ash can be developed as the backbone of photocatalysts to be used in the wastewater treatment however very few research works have been reported in the literature for the photocatalytic degradation removal of organic pollutants from water and wastewater therefore budding researchers all over the world should pay more attention interest in this novel area of research 18 conclusion coal is the crucial source of energy for generating electricity in a

mineral residue generated as a by product of coal burning in the thermal power plants the temperature of the combustion process may be as high as 2000 c most of the inorganic material in the coal gets melted and fused at such high temperatures in india 73 of electricity is produced by thermal power plants out of which 90 are based on coal combustion about 221 million tons of cfa is produced annually from which only about 60 is utilized and the rest is dumped in the ash ponds finding of disposal site and unproductive use of land discourages the disposal of fly ash the utilization of cfa

are the major constituents of cfa the presence of heavy metals such as mercury cadmium arsenic cobalt copper lead chromium etc results in the toxicity of fly ash indian coal is of poor quality due to its low calorific value and high ash content resulting in an excessive amount of cfa it is not very easy to utilize low grade coal because of some undesirable properties such as higher moisture content high ash content and the presence of a high amount of sulphur 2 lignite is the most abundant form of coal estimated to be more than 4 trillion tones around the globe 3 and both lignite and sub

problems by blocking the amount of sunlight reaching the underwater ecosystem 8 leather paint steel and electroplating industries are the sources of heavy metal ions such as lead mercury arsenic copper nickel cobalt etc in wastewater 9 for instance in a study it was estimated that asia releases 69 of the total mercury in the environment just by coal combustion in the year 2010 10 when accumulated in humans through seafood these heavy metals result in low blood pressure brain damage edema and even cancer at high concentrations copper and cobalt are essential for growth and development of the body at a lower concentrations however at a higher concentrations can cause liver damage goiter anemia and insomnia petroleum refining industries produce a large amount of wastewater containing high amounts of non biodegradable pollutants like metal ions phenolic compounds sulphides ammonia and oils 11 12 in a recent research reported by bahri et al 13 the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater produced by abadan petrochemical refinery was reported to be extremely high 20 000 mg o2 l this wastewater is released into the persian gulf causing severe health problems to the nearby inhabitants and destroying the natural ecosystem if not treated properly with the development of science and technology cfa is emerging as a potential raw material for various industrial applications the potential applications of cfa include its utilization as a fertilizer in agriculture highway embankment construction of bricks cement mine filling production of ceramics and zeolites adsorbent for gases and pollutants from wastewater among various methods used for the removal of contaminants such as coagulation chemical oxidation electrolytic precipitation and microfiltration adsorption has remained an economical and simple method for wastewater treatment 14 materials with larger surface area and greater pore size may act as excellent adsorbents physical properties like greater surface area and high porosity make cfa an excellent low cost adsorbent for removing toxic heavy metals and dyes from wastewater recently the production of zeolites and geopolymers from cfa for wastewater treatment has gained much importance due to the high adsorption capacity and ion exchange property of cfa zeolites they are widely examined for wastewater treatment for example javadian et al 15 investigated zeolite based geopolymer synthesized from cfa via the hydrothermal method to remove cd ii ions from wastewater and examined various factors affecting the adsorption of cadmium ions the prepared geopolymer was effective in removing 96 of the cadmium after 7 h of contact time under optimum ph of 5 initial concentration of 10 mg l and catalyst dosage of 0 08 g in 25 ml of solution the adsorption kinetic study showed that the process followed a pseudo second order reaction and the data best fitted the langmuir isothermal model fig 1 shows the percentage of fly ash utilized in different sectors today about 10 20 of total fly ash is used for construction purposes as an additive for cement production 16 18 due to the presence of cao and good water retention properties class c fly ash is used for soil treatment and for maintaining the ph of the soil 19 20 low grade cfa is highly available and an excellent source of aluminosilicates and used as a raw material for the production of geopolymers zeolites and various fly ash based photocatalysts for wastewater treatment 21 it is also used for the adsorption of carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur from the air 22 23 the utilization of coal fly ash for wastewater treatment is an impressive way to cope up with this by product which otherwise is a major problem for several countries 24 there are various research articles published addressing the utilization of cfa as a low cost adsorbent for wastewater treatment but most of the papers just focused on the removal of heavy metals or organic dyes only a few papers highlighted the removal of other organic compounds like pesticides and pharmaceutical products this review tries to summarize the advantages of cfa and other adsorbents like zeolites and geopolymers derived from cfa as low cost adsorbents for the removal of a wide range of pollutants including dyes heavy metals pesticides and pharmaceutical compounds the use of cfa as a photocatalyst for the degradation of dyes is also highlighted in this paper this article aims to provide an environmentally friendly method to utilize fly ash for wastewater treatment it is worth mentioning that the term fly ash refers to the fly ash produced by the combustion of coal the perspectives for further research and some other ways of utilizing fly ash are also mentioned in this article 2 concerns of thermal power plant a air pollution coal combustion results in the production of several air pollutants like oxides of sulphur and nitrogen and carbon monoxide when mixed with water vapours these pollutants produce acid rain which leads to serious health problems in humans as well as in animal and plant kingdom b water pollution cooling tower produces a large amount of wastewater in thermal power plants the water may be reused post treatment or can be disposed into a water source when the water is discharged without treatment it can alter the chemical constituents of freshwater and thermal pollution affects the average water temperature in turn disturbing the aquatic life c ash handling and disposal disposal of cfa in the ash ponds is one of the major causes of air pollution water pollution and land pollution in a nearby area a large amount of valuable land area is wasted in the disposal of fly ash which otherwise can be used for agriculture or farming if ash ponds are left open uncovered fly ash become dry and rises in the air increasing the particulate matter in the air d problems related to fly ash cfa a potent air pollutant is a powdered substance which travels with air and if inhaled can cause severe lung problems if fly ash settles in farming land it can reduce the yield of the crop ash ponds require large landmass for ash disposal this reduces the land area available for other purposes conversion of fly ash into slurry for disposal also requires colossal water consumption various heavy metals and pollutants can percolate in the ground and freshwater from ash ponds and pollute it 3 collection of cfa after the combustion of coal the bottom 20 of ash is called bottom ash and the rest 80 is conveyed as pulverized fly ash bottom ash is disposed of in the slurry form for removing dust from flue gases by using mechanical or electrical methods fabric filters are used as mechanical collection devices and electrostatic precipitator is used as an electrical method to collect fly ash electrostatic precipitator esp is a tool for collecting fly ash with an efficiency of 99 esps have low operating costs and economically viable 4 characteristics of cfa fly ash is powdery material with a greyish colour and is alkaline in nature siliceous and aluminous inorganic compounds in fly ash are called pozzolans because when it comes in contact with water and quick lime it forms cement like products cfa is a mixture of both micro and macronutrients potassium phosphorus calcium magnesium zinc iron copper manganese boron and molybdenum are generally present in the fly ash the geotechnical properties of cfa are mostly used in the construction of roads and its pozzolan properties make it useful for manufacturing cement and other building material like bricks fly ash with high silicon content is excellent for making zeolites and alum 26 cfa is an excellent adsorbent for wastewater treatment because of its essential physiochemical properties such as bulk density greater surface area and small size of particles high porosity and water holding capacity from the viewpoint of thermal power plants cfa is a waste however other industries like cement production might use it as a binding agent studies are being carried out for developing new methods for the sustainable use of cfa in agriculture and engineering 27 28 preparation of zeolites from cfa is also an interesting topic for future research 29 cfa can also be utilized as a cheap adsorbent for different pollutants in treating wastewater different aspects of cfa to adsorb pollutants from wastewater are discussed in this paper 5 classes and composition of cfa cfa is broadly classified into two categories i e class f fly ash and class c fly ash according to astm c 618 the main difference in the two categories is the varying amount of calcium alumina silica and hematite present the quality anthracite bituminous sub bituminous and lignite and the geographical region from where the coal comes also influence the chemical properties of cfa the chemical composition of cfa changes according to the composition of coal broadly the chemical composition of cfa can be given as silica 60 65 alumina 25 30 and magnetite 6 15 1 a class f fly ash fly ash formed by burning of anthracite and bituminous coal where the amount of lime present is below 10 and the total content of sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 is higher than 70 wt is called class f fly ash the higher pozzolanic properties require cementing agents such as quick lime and water to give cementitious compounds geopolymers are produced by the addition of chemical activators na2sio3 to class f fly ash b class c fly ash fly ash produced by the combustion of low quality coal like lignite and sub bituminous where the amount of lime present is greater than 20 and the total content of sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 is in the range of 50 70 wt is known as class c fly ash the content of alkali and sulfates are generally higher and it is less pozzolanic than class f fly ash due to this there is no need for chemical activators the properties of a cfa sample are shown in table 1 6 properties of cfa it is essential to examine the different characteristics of cfa such as chemical composition mineralogy surface chemistry and reactivity for its potential applications 6 1 physical properties cfa is a powdery substance where particles are mostly spherical porous and generally amorphous in nature the particle size of bituminous cfa is less than 0 075 nm on the other hand cfa of sub bituminous coal is rough and larger than that of bituminous cfa the specific gravity of most of the cfa is in between 2 1 3 0 but the surface area may vary largely from 170 to 1000 m2 kg 31 34 the carbon content produces a blackish colour to the fly ash 6 2 chemical properties the methods of handling and storage and composition of coal largely influence the chemical properties of cfa coal is classified into anthracite bituminous sub bituminous and lignite each varying in calorific value chemical composition ash content and heating value silica alumina magnetite calcium and carbon are the main components of bituminous cfa lignite and sub bituminous cfa contain a higher amount of cao and mgo less concentration of silica and magnetite and lower unburned carbon content than that of bituminous cfa anthracite is the purest form of coal that is not burned in thermal power plants and therefore only a small amount of anthracite cfa is available the usual range of the chemical composition of different types of cfa is shown in table 2 the mineralogy of cfa is studied by the x ray diffraction method the principal mineral phases used are quartz kaolinite illite and siderite calcite pyrite and hematite are less predominant in coal the xrd pattern of cfa is shown in fig 2 the major peaks are due to the presence of quartz and smaller peaks indicate amorphous phases alumino silicates of spherical shape is of the size between 1 15 μm as shown in fig 3 36 7 biomass ash the utilization of biomass as a fuel produces more fly ash causing environmental pollution however in contrast to the coal fly ash toxic heavy metals are not present in the biomass ash the composition of biomass ash depends upon the class of biomass soil mineralogy and method of handling 37 generally the common elements present in biomass fuels which results in the generation of fly ash are calcium sodium potassium silicon and phosphorus among these calcium sodium phosphorus and potassium are nutrients for biomass 36 some biomass like rice husk is rich in silicon content while wood has a high alkali metal content the elemental composition of biomass ash depends on the combustion technique used for its production mostly clean biomass combustion generates fly ash containing high alkali and less alumina as compared to cfa 37 39 biomass ash shows a wide variation in composition and concentration of inorganic components than coal fly ash which depends on the origin and type of plant moreover even the same type of biomass shows a more substantial variation in composition depending upon weather season and storage methods 37 41 various types of biomass ash derived from rice husk wood wheat and cane straw showed same pozzolanic properties as compared to that of cfa 42 44 rice husk fly ash has a higher silica content and therefore is used in the cement manufacture as an insulator and substitute to silica 45 8 utilization of fly ash there are several advantages of utilizing fly ash some of these are i wastage of money in the disposal of fly ash can be saved ii minimal waste of land for disposal thus the land can be used in other ways and iii fly ash is a by product and reusing by product can save natural resources fly ash utilization includes an additive in cement manufacturing insulator utilization in construction of roads and construction material as a lightweight aggregate in mine filling and for treating wastewater and many more the utilization of fly ash for the treatment remediation of wastewater is discussed below 9 treatment of wastewater using cfa there are different ways for wastewater treatment however mostly they are expensive and not applicable for industrial applications utilization of fly ash as a low cost adsorbent for wastewater treatment has proven to be one of the most economic and successful method utilization of cfa for the removal of toxic metals colour dyes and organic compounds are discussed below 9 1 removal of toxic metals the utilization of cfa for the treatment of wastewater has gained much attention recently the presence of unburned carbon and physical properties such as porosity greater surface area and small particle size makes cfa an excellent low cost adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater the alkaline nature of cfa imparts neutralizing property while the oxides such as alumina silica calcium oxide and iron oxides present in fly ash adsorb toxic heavy metals from wastewater to increase the heavy metal adsorption efficiency the ph of the solution is increased by using lime and sodium hydroxide 46 47 summary of different toxic metals adsorbed on fly ash are given in table 3 nowadays heavy metals toxicity has become a serious problem for public health chemical paint and pesticide

concentrations removal of phosphate using cfa was investigated and found that the calcium rich fly ash is very effective for the adsorption for orthophosphate 85 86 high calcium fly ash precipitate phosphate ions immediately at low or neutral ph in the solution 87 treatment of fly ash with acid increases the phosphate removal ability of fly ash acid modified fly ash forms insoluble salt when combined with phosphate ions resulting in the precipitation colloidal organic and inorganic pollutants and turbidity can also be removed by adding surface activating agents in crossflow microfiltration 88 89 9 2 2 fluoride removal fluoride in lower amount is essential for bones and teeth but excessive levels can be a serious issue higher levels of fluoride in groundwater is emerging as a global issue fluoride toxicity at low concentration can cause problems such as weight loss low calcium in the blood hypocalcemia excessive potassium in the blood hyperkalemia and dental problems at high concentrations fluoride consumption can cause cancer and other serious problems like osteoporosis the coal based power plant semiconductor manufacturing fertilizer manufacturing and ceramic

for mb can be increased by increasing base concentration and treatment time 129 the adsorption of toluidine blue tb from dilute solution was examined using fly ash modified with a cationic surfactant and an anionic surfactant 136 cationic surfactant decreases the adsorption efficiency because the surfactant due to its positive charge also competes for the adsorption along with the positively charged dye molecules as illustrated by two step adsorption isotherm wang et al 128 reported that the adsorption efficiency of fa is due to the presence of porous unburned carbon in it and not because of the size of fa particles adsorption capacity can be improved by increasing the unburned carbon content in the fa another study showed that the adsorption capacity of carbon present in fly ash is

follows pseudo second order kinetics 11 3 arylmethane dyes as the name suggests arylmethane dyes are those dyes in which one or more hydrogen of methane are substituted by an aromatic ring they are also called phenylmethane dyes researchers found that the adsorption of arylmethane dyes on fly ash is because of the interaction of the anionic dye with the cationic surface of fa particles 139 140 adsorption of malachite green orange g og and methyl violet mv were investigated using bagasse fly ash from aqueous solutions 140 141 adsorption of mv was favoured with high negative values of gibbs

that the adsorption efficiency can be increased by reducing the particle size of fly ash lime content also influences the adsorption of dye to some extent 127 130 a study revealed that the dye adsorption efficiency decreases in the presence of other organic components like methanol and acetone oppositely charged surfactants also affect the dye adsorption process low concentration of surfactant promotes sorption but a high concentration of surfactant helps dye molecules to remain in the solution other inorganic components in fa have less effect on adsorption 131 another study showed that bottom fly ash was capable of removing 87 5 of alizarin yellow and 97 of fast green 145 11 4 1 dye removal by surface modified fly ash the adsorptive dye removal efficiency of fa can be improved by its surface modifications fly ash was treated with quaternary ammonium cations for the removal of dyes from wastewater and aqueous solutions structure and size of the cation affects the adsorption capacity 146 adsorption of r6g and mg was investigated by chemically modified fly ash and rate order kinetics were reported 147 the study revealed adsorption of r6g and mg occurs through weak forces and dye structure and adsorbent surface also influenced the adsorption capacity the adsorption data indicates pseudo second order kinetic because the results show similarity to langmuir

commercial zeolite y 154 a study revealed that base modified zfa can adsorb cationic dye like methylene blue more easily than anionic dye such as alizarin yellow 155 the efficiency was increased 10 times after treatment with naoh as compared to that of normal zeolite 13 geopolymers for wastewater treatment the geopolymer technology provided an alternative sustainable method for the utilization of cfa the al2o3 and sio2 in cfa are activated by strong bases naoh or koh resulting in the formation a geopolymer fig 8 shows the reaction of geo polymerization of fly ash 156 production of

circulation as the heavy metals get adsorbed automatically 14 mechanism of adsorption and chemical kinetics for the adsorption of a liquid on a solid surface the transfer of solute depends on external mass transfer interparticle diffusion or both of them the mechanism of adsorption process involves three steps i movement of solute particles towards adsorbent surface present in the solution ii then the solute particles are diffused onto the pores of adsorbent and a small amount of solute gets adsorbed on the surface iii solute adsorption on the pores and capillaries of inner interfaces of the adsorbent the third step is assumed to be in equilibrium with surface adsorption and is neglected generally the pore diffusion of surface diffusion is considered as the slow and rate determining step lagergren pseudo first order kinetics external and interparticle diffusion model and pseudo second order kinetics are generally investigated for studying the adsorption kinetics the equations

qt is the amount of solute adsorbed per gram of the adsorbent on the surface at time t cs and ct are the concentration of solute on the surface and in solution respectively and s is the specific surface area of the adsorbent several researchers investigated the adsorption kinetics of dyes heavy metals and other compounds on cfa and reported that the adsorption generally followed pseudo second order kinetics 112 138 147 15 adsorption isotherms the adsorption data of dyes and heavy metal ions on cfa indicates that the adsorption process is generally represented by the freundlich and langmuir isotherms the langmuir isotherms are applicable for the adsorption on homogenous surfaces and the interactions between the adsorbed molecules are ignored the langmuir equation for a single component system is given by 5 x m v m k c e 1 k c e the above equation can be linearized as 6 e x m 1 k v m c e v m where ce is the concentration of the solution at equilibrium x m is the amount of solute

ⅇ q r t where q is the heat of adsorption most of the adsorption phenomenon of dyes on cfa can be described by the langmuir isotherms generally vm and k are proportional to the temperature which suggests that adsorption efficiency can be increased at higher temperatures the freundlich isotherm model is used to describe adsorption occurring in dilute solutions according to the following equation 8 x m k f c e 1 n the above equation can be linearized as 9 log x m log k f log c e 1 n where kf is the adsorption capacity and 1 n is the adsorption intensity a plot of log x m versus log ce

as a photocatalyst fly ash contains many photoactive oxides such as fe2o3 cao and tio2 in small quantities researchers showed various ways of modifying fly ash to be used as a photocatalyst for the photodegradation of pollutants in wastewater cfa can be used as a sole photocatalyst or with other photocatalytic materials depending upon the constituents of cfa fly ash impregnated with tio2 was investigated for the removal of phenol from water the result depicted that fly ash is a better supporting material for a photocatalyst about 94 4 of phenol was removed from water 161 fly ash modified with zno nano catalyst was studied for the decomposition of mo dye almost 100 of the dye was removed within 10 min of irradiation with uv light 162 to impart antibacterial properties and enhance adsorption efficiency of fly ash it is doped with ag and zno nanoparticles 163 zno fly ash was successfully used for the degradation of azo dyes such as reactive orange 4 trypan blue and rb 164 co fly ash was investigated as an effective photocatalyst for the degradation of acid red 1 in water 165 in a study wang et al 166 reported that cfa based photocatalysts are strong oxidizing agents because they produce hydroxyl radicals in water to degrade large organic molecules fly ash was modified with cuo to increase the adsorption of visible light by cfa based photocatalyst cuo shifted the bandgap energy from 1 2 ev to 2 09 ev it took 40 min for the cuo fly ash to degrade 99 1 of methyl orange 167 to improve the adsorption capacity of photocatalyst and to increase the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment fa can be blended with a conductive polymer the presence of nanocomposite increases the adsorption efficiency and as the photocatalyst gets saturated with adsorbate it gets coagulated 168 16 1 mechanism of photodegradation mechanism of photodegradation involves five main steps i photoexcitation ii ionization of water iii oxidation and reduction iv protonation of superoxide and v recombination of electron hole pairs 169 the reactions representing each step of photodegradation are given below tio2 hv h vb e cb h2o oh h o2 e cb o 2 h2o h vb oh h o 2 h hoo hoo e

in cb produce superoxide radical o 2 upon reaction with adsorbed oxygen these superoxide radicals initiate the degradation of adsorbed dyes by undergoing a series of the reaction producing h2o2 hoo ho2 and oh 170 17 future research and prospects for the utilization of fly ash fa has potential applications for the removal of various organic and inorganic pollutants from water researchers have paid more attention in this direction because of the excellent adsorption capacity of fly ash and its large scale availability without cost fly ash was used as an economic adsorbent in place of activated carbon for wastewater treatment adsorption capacity of fly ash can be increased by modifying fly ash with suitable materials and methods inorganic components in fly ash make it useful for the synthesis of zeolite and geopolymers which can further be used for water treatment fly ash has various nutrients such as magnesium potassium calcium boron iron sulphur copper phosphorus and zinc which are essential for plant growth thus fly ash can be an alternative to chemical fertilizers used in the agriculture industry previously it has been used in place of lime for maintaining the ph of the soil studies claim that fly ash also has the pesticidal removal properties due to the presence of silica which could kill insects 171 there is a lesser information available for the utilization of fly ash as a low cost fertilizer therefore more research should be conducted in this area most of the researchers studied the adsorption of phenol dye and pesticide concerning initial ph in a single pollutant system but no studies were reported for the adsorption of phenol dye and pesticide with varying ph during the reaction and in the presence of other contaminants like heavy metal ions and other organic compounds in a multi pollutant system the comparison of adsorption efficiency depend not only the parameters related to the experimental conditions and the effluent but also on the analytical method used for decontamination tests batch method column reactors etc thus a direct comparison of data obtained using various low cost adsorbents is difficult because of inconsistencies in the data presentation hence more efforts should be attempted in this direction the adsorption data were fitted with either the langmuir model or the freundlich model there are very few papers available about the adsorption of pollutants according to net bet isotherm it is also found that most of the adsorption experiments were performed only in the lab scale under batch mode of operation therefore more studies need to be carried out in the column flow adsorption system for its practical applications the adsorption data obtained from the literature must be used to develop new fly ash based low costs adsorbents which can be used at an industrial level more research should be conducted to test the developed fly ash based low cost adsorbents with real wastewater there are very fewer data available about the reproducibility of adsorption results the adsorbent must be physically and chemically stable reproducibility of adsorption data is important for an adsorbent material to be used at a pilot plant level however very less information is available in this direction therefore more research should be conducted in these areas the utilization of coal fly ash as a sole or supported photocatalyst for the degradation of dyes and other organic compounds from water phase is a comparatively new area of research coal fly ash can be developed as the backbone of photocatalysts to be used in the wastewater treatment however very few research works have been reported in the literature for the photocatalytic degradation removal of organic pollutants from water and wastewater therefore budding researchers all over the world should pay more attention interest in this novel area of research 18 conclusion coal is the crucial source of energy for generating electricity in a thermal power plant low grade indian coal generates a large amount of fly ash cfa is a greyish powdery material generated as a by product of coal combustion the properties of coal largely affect the composition and uses of cfa fly ash now has become a potential starting material for the cement producing industry and other construction applications coal fly ash has also been found to be a better adsorbent and substitute of activated carbon for the removal of various pollutants from water and wastewater the above investigation showed that coal fly ash could be effectively utilized for the adsorptive removal of phenols and substituted phenols dyes heavy metals pesticides and many other organic and inorganic pollutants from water and wastewater the adsorption capacity of fly ash depends upon the amount of unburned carbon silica and alumina content it also depends on the physical parameters such as the temperature of combustion ph of fly ash adsorbent dose and pollutant concentration cfa is an excellent adsorbent for the removal of pollutants in lower concentration from wastewater utilization of cfa in wastewater treatment has opened a wider scope of research and helped to reduce the resources of pollution cfa is modified for better adsorption efficiency unburned carbon present in cfa plays a crucial role in the removal of pollutants contaminants from water lastly it is also concluded that coal fly ash may be utilized as a sole photocatalyst or supported photocatalyst depending upon its constituents for the degradation of dyes and other organic compounds from water phase

13512,the impacts of influent cod n ratios on the floc properties and microbial communities of nitrifying sludge under high strength ammonia conditions were investigated excessive organic loads severely deteriorated the nitrification rate and biomass liquid separation moreover both deficient and ample organic substrates affected the bioflocculation changes in cod n ratios resulted in considerable variations in the functional groups and compositions of extracellular polymeric substances eps the eps contents almost unchanged as decreasing the cod n ratio from 2 to 0 however the polysaccharides ps contents significantly surpassed that of proteins when cod n ratio increased from 2 to 10 tryptophan proteins like substances were the prominent constituents in eps but the intensities tapered off with the increment of cod n ratio while more humic acid like substances generated under both extremely low and high cod n ratio situations structural changes of eps constituents were dominated by cod n ratio varying mass generation of hydrophilic functional groups related to polysaccharides significantly deteriorated flocculation furthermore the elevated level of cod n ratios favoured the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and polysaccharide secreting bacteria but inhibited nitrifying bacteria nevertheless the presence of certain amounts of organic substrates were beneficial to maintain microbial species diversity and proliferation of nitrospira keywords cod n ratio eps bioflocculation nitrifying sludge microbial community 1 introduction large amounts of high ammonia wastewater have been discharged through industrial and agricultural production it is necessary to remove ammonia from wastewater to prevent water bodies from eutrophication biological nitrogen removal process bnrp is a highly promising method of treating high strength ammonia wastewater for its multiple advantages which include high economic efficiency limited secondary pollution and simple operation 1 with a slow growth rate and a small proportion of microbial aggregates nitrifying bacteria was vulnerable to environmental conditions resulting in the nitrification process constantly to be the rate limiting step of bnrp 2 because of the variations in influents and process operations the bnrp is often operated under unsteady conditions the irregular changes in substrate composition and flow rate cause the fluctuation of organic loading rates olrs in nitrifying sludge ns systems 3 as a critical parameter for nitrification processes cod n ratio is decisive for the physiological properties of microorganisms and chemical compositions of biomass in activated sludge 4 the unstable cod n ratios operational conditions often cause severe deterioration in treatment performance and sludge water separation of sludge system 5 thus far vast attentions have been paid to the effect of cod n ratio on nitrogen removal and floc characteristics in conventional activated sludge cas processes treating municipal wastewater 1 6 however the study on the effect of cod n ratio shock on the floc physicochemical characteristics and microbial community of ns exposed to high concentrations of ammonia is definitely limited 4 6 under high strength ammonia conditions the nutrient removal bioflocculation and microflora would be damaged because the activities of functional microorganisms were restrained by free ammonia 7 8 therefore a comprehensive insight into the consequence of influent cod n ratio on floc physicochemical characteristics and microbial colonies of ns under high strength ammonia wastewater conditions is essential for maintaining highly efficient treatment of bnrp process recently a profound emphasis is given to cod n ratio in relation to extracellular polymeric substances eps eps are the key structural materials of microbial aggregates and the characteristics of eps greatly determine the floc structure surface properties flocculability settleability dewaterability and adsorption ability of bioaggregates 9 15 some investigators unfolded that restricted cod n ratios benefited the secretion of total eps 16 17 while others held a contrary opinion or independent viewpoint 13 18 to date the influence of cod n ratio on the eps production and floc physicochemical characteristics in cas is not yet unified even less in ns system it is difficult to generalize how does cod n ratio impact on eps characteristics of ns based on previous studies due to the variances of operating conditions activated sludge characteristics and evaluation methods in addition sludge property and microbial community have been proved to be interrelated which are also dependent on cod n ratio this is mainly owing to the different substrate affinity metabolic activity resistance and even eps secretion characteristics exhibited by various microorganisms 19 microbial colony not only determines the treatment performance but also the stability of ns it is widely considered that heterotrophs are disadvantageous to nitrifiers because heterotrophs are more competitive in the ammonia and oxygen than nitrifiers 1 however an opposite view has also been proposed that the existence of heterotrophic bacteria can ensure the stability of the autotrophic ecosystem and enhance the activity of the nitrifiers 20 22 besides the variations of cod n ratio significantly affect the microbial population and correspond to the eps production which is believed to contribute to sludge instability 20 hitherto the effect of cod n ratio on the eps production floc physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities on ns is still unclear considering the significance of eps and microbial communities in biological wastewater treatment processes further investigations are a requisite for elucidating the impact of influent cod n ratios on eps production and microbial community structure in ns under high ammonia environment the objective of this study is to unfold the impacts of influent cod n ratios on the variability of floc physicochemical characteristics of ns under high strength ammonia conditions including the nitrification performance biomass liquid separation eps production and microbial populations findings from this study would be valuable for the enhancement of the stability of ns treating high strength ammonia wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge systems the experiment was conducted in eight sequencing batch reactors sbrs each with a working volume of 5 l the reactors

air diffusers mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations were kept at 2500 mg l moreover do concentrations in each reactor were maintained above 4 mg l at the end of reaction the ph and

operated at the cod n ratio of 2 for 60 days to achieve the steady state of ns subsequently the cod n ratio was varied from 2 to 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 the organic loading rate was changed from 0 067

60 mg mgso4 7h2o 18 mg cacl2 and 0 38 ml trace metal solution the carbon content was adjusted by modifying the amount of sodium acetate in the influent to vary the cod n ratio 2 2 eps extraction and composition analysis a heat extraction method was used to extract eps from ns as reported previously 23 the sludge samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min to remove the bulk solution after discarding the supernatant the remaining sludge pellets were washed and resuspended to their original volume with saline water 0 05 nacl solution the mixed liquor of each sample was then subjected to a heat treatment at 60 for 30 min and centrifuged again at 12 000 rpm for 15 min the eps was finally obtained by filtering the centrifuged mixed liquor using 0 22 μm membranes toc was measured by a toc analyser shimadzu toc l japan the measurement of dna was in accordance with the diphenylamine colorimetric method and proteins pn and polysaccharides ps were determined by the lowry and the anthrone method respectively 24 the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra of eps were surveyed by fluorescence spectrometer fp 6500 jasco corporation japan and ftir spectrometer irprestige 21 shimadzu japan respectively 2 3 water quality and sludge physical property analysis levels of cod total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n mlss and sludge volume index svi were measured according to the standard methods 25 the specific nitrification rate snr was calculated on the basis of nh4 n conversion during one reaction period the sludge morphology was examined with scanning electron microscope jsm 6510lv japan and microscope nikon 90i japan filamentous organism content was quantified as filament index using the method described by jenkins et al 26 a laser particle size distribution analyser ls230 beckman coulter us was used to determine the floc size distribution the sludge flocculation and dewaterability were characterized by flocculating ability fa and specific resistance of the filtration srf following the method of jin et al 11 and li and yang 27 respectively all parameters described above were detected in triplicate 2 4 analysis of microbial community by high throughput 454 pyrosequencing the dna extracted from the samples collected from the sludge system was amplified by pcr using primers 341 f 5 barcode cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 barcode gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 pcr reactions were done in triplicate 30 μl mixtures containing 15 μl of 2 taq master

triplicate experiments the statistical analysis was conducted with spss 19 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cod n ratio on nutrient removal variation of cod n ratio in the ns process significantly influenced the performance of nutrient removal fig 1 in general effluent cod concentrations were positively related to cod n ratios the removal of cod increased with the cod n ratio elevating and remained stable at 80 when cod n ratio exceeded 4 in contrast concentrations of the effluent nh4 n and no2 n were negligible and tn existed mainly in the form of no3 n at low cod n ratios an obvious accumulation of no2 n was detected in the effluent at the cod n ratio of 8 and nh4 n remained with a further increase of cod n ratio to 10 high substrate concentration hampered do diffusion and then caused the partial limitation of do the enzymatic system involved in nitrification especially that of nob is sensitive to do concentration that is why much more no2 n than nh4 n accumulated under high cod n ratios 1 moreover the oxygen stress at high cod n ratios caused a reduction of activity in ammonia oxidation the snr decreased dramatically from 28 06 2 02 6 48 0 73 mg nh4 n g vss h when the cod n ratio was raised from 0 to 10 this agreed with the washout of nitrifying bacteria under high cod n ratios table 1 furthermore simultaneous denitrification occurred in all sludge systems whereby denitrification efficiency was dramatically enhanced with the enrichment of electron donors 3 2 effects of cod n ratio on sludge physical properties of ns changes in cod n ratios resulted in marked variations in sludge floc structures compact and smooth shaped flocs were observed in low cod n ratio systems while porous and rough shaped flocs dominated in high cod n ratio systems although most of the sludge had a low level 1 2 levels of filamentous microorganisms excessive proliferation of filamentous microorganism 3 4 levels was found in the sludge at cod n ratios of 8 and 10 overall the mean floc size remained stable when cod n ratio was less than 2 but gradually increased to 110 9 2 7 μm as the cod n ratio climbed to 10 table 2 this result further demonstrates that large mean floc sizes are associated with high cod n ratios 6 9 it is generally believed that filamentous microorganisms could act as a backbone for floc formation thereby increasing the floc size 4 the porous floc structure and abundant filamentous bacteria led to the increase of floc sizes in the ns however the impacts of cod n ratio on flocs size were inconsistent in reported literature 4 6 9 11 18 28 this divergence might be related to the different types of activated sludge operating conditions and range of cod n ratio the sludge flocculation and dewaterability characteristics were desirable at the phase of cod n 2 but worsened with further uplift in cod n ratio table 2 the flocculation and dewaterability of sludge were influenced slightly when the cod n ratio decreased from 2 to 0 on the other hand when the cod n ratio increased from 2 to 10 the fa decreased and srf increased significantly leading to severe deterioration in flocculation and dewaterability of the sludge this finding provides additional support that the sludge bioflocculation and dewaterability worsens after a high cod n ratio is imposed 5 moreover the settleability of sludge was excellent under the low cod n conditions but significant deterioration occurred when cod n ratio above 4 the svi increased dramatically to 238 4 14 2 ml g at a cod n ratio of 6 generally a low degree of settleability is related to weakly flocculated sludge flocs formed by tiny flocs or flocs with high levels of filamentous bacteria 29 in this study loose floc structure with high numbers of filamentous organisms was observed which might be directly related to the deterioration of sludge settleability at high cod n ratios the results above indicate that the shock of cod n ratio has an adverse impact on floc structure and biosolids water separation of ns the sludge presented a dense structure at low cod n ratios accompanied by an excellent nitrification rate but when the ns was cultivated without organics the growth of ns could be restrained causing unstable biomass due to the lack of electron donor besides when the ns was cultured under high cod n conditions the do diffusion was limited in flocs and easily formed irregular floc morphology the floc structure was closely related to the microbial community it was suggested that nitrifiers tended to exist in dense zoogloea of flocs while heterotrophic bacteria were likely to grow in irregular morphology 26 therefore it can be inferred that the variance of cod n ratio might bring about significant disturbance to the proliferation of nitrifiers under high ammonia conditions consequently leading to the deterioration of nitrification performance and biomass liquid separation 3 3 effect of cod n ratio on eps production and components 3 3 1 compositions of eps eps refer to the biopolymers formed by cells attached to the surface of flocs the contents of pn and ps in eps were measured under different cod n ratios the shift of cod n ratios resulted in considerable variations in the constituents of eps fig 2 a slight increase in total bound eps was detected after the cod n ratio change was imposed the rather consistent levels of total eps under different process conditions are in line with the other observations 5 27 28 as a predominant component in each reactor the contents of pn were nearly constant under low cod n ratios cod n 0 2 but gradually dropped below that of ps when cod n ratio increased from 2 to 10 moreover the contents of dna in eps did not change significantly stabilizing at about 3 5 mg g vss which indicated that bacterial cells were not destroyed during the eps extraction process hence a negative correlation was found between cod n and pn ps ratio which provided additional support to that sludge growing in wastewater with low cod n ratios tended to produce eps with a high pn ps ratio 13 27 29 the present study demonstrated that the proportion of pn and ps in eps was significantly affected by organic substrates and certified that under high cod n ratios bacteria tended to convert excess carbon substrates into extracellular storage compounds such as ps in eps in ns system conversely at low cod n ratios most organics were used in biomass synthesis instead of ps secretion and intracellular pn would be released due to increased lysis and endogenous respiration besides the decreased pn ps ratio under high cod n ratios was significantly correlated with the deterioration of sludge flocculation settleability and dewaterability anova p 0 05 the decisive role of pn ps in bioflocculation was consistent with previous findings 6 28 29 the cod n ratio considerably affected microbial metabolisms and hence on the eps production to date although several reports are published on the relationship between cod n and eps a predetermined favourable cod n ratio has not been determined in the literature this lack of predetermined cod n might be due to the specific types of sludge reported 4 6 eps in sludge would be stable if operating conditions were beneficial to the microbial community but its production changed significantly under adverse conditions supposedly bacteria in microbial aggregates were likely to generate more eps under unfavourable conditions 3 the stable operation of ns system under dynamic cod n ratio conditions is essential for the secretion of microbial eps moreover the constituents of eps played important roles in microbial adhesion and aggregation processes 11 18 27 29 but the specific influence of individual eps components on the flocculation of microbial aggregates was still unclear for further studies it may be essential to characterize the constituents of eps on a molecular basis that characterization would give more detailed insight into the mechanisms involved in the bioflocculation process 3 3 2 eem spectra of eps fig 3 shows the 3d eem spectra of eps extracted from ns under different cod n ratios it was observed that not only the major fluorescence substances but also the fluorescence intensities of eps samples varied with changes in cod n ratio three fluorescence peaks peak a b and c were readily identified from the eem spectra peak a observed at ex em wavelengths of 230 240 330 355 nm referred to aromatic pn like substances peak b 280 290 330 360 nm represented the tryptophan pn like substances and peak c 350 360 420 430 nm was associated with humic acid like substances 30 31 similar fluorescence patterns for aromatic peak a and b were observed under different cod n ratio conditions suggesting that the constituents of the pn like substances might be ubiquitous in ns 31 in terms of the fluorescence intensity peak b tryptophan pn like substances was found to be the prominent peak in the eem spectra of eps which corresponded well to the result that pn was the major component of eps a large number of exoenzymes present in the eps matrix might be the reason why pn was dominant in eps 27 moreover the fluorescence intensities of peak a and peak b gradually decreased as the cod n ratios increased which was corroborated that pn contents were decreased by the photometric analysis unlike pn like substances changes in cod n ratio had significant bearing on the production of humic acid like substances the fluorescence intensities of humic acid like substances peak c strengthened when the cod n ratio changed from 2 to other operation conditions the production of humic acid like substances in eps is generally related to the decomposition of dead cells and macromolecular organics 30 32 this finding suggested that the uncomfortable conditions that increased cell lysis under low cod n ratios and decreased microorganism activities under high cod n ratios which in turn produced more humic acid humic compounds have been considered as a key constituent in eps however their special functions in bioflocculation have not been exactly explained 24 it was reported that humic compounds could be used as electron donors or acceptors to exert redox activity in microbial aggregates 33 nonetheless some others suggested that the humic acid like materials were likely to deteriorate the sludge flocculation 9 24 30 which reasonably explains the deteriorated flocculability in this study 3 3 3 ftir spectra of eps the influence of cod n ratio on the potential dominant functional groups in eps was investigated by ftir analysis as shown in fig 4 the eps possessed various absorption bands in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the functional groups can be classified into four categories including hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids 23 a broad stretching band that appeared at 3200 3600 cm 1 was associated with the oh groups of carbohydrates the ftir within 1800 400 cm 1 region can be apart into six main regions 1700 1600 cm 1 amide i region 1600 1500 cm 1 amide ii region 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii region 1500 1300 cm 1 carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds 1200 900 cm 1 nucleic acids and polysaccharides and 900 400 cm 1 fingerprint region 23 32 in accordance with previous studies different kinds of bands presented in almost all regions of the ftir some delicate differences proved the changes in flocculability of ns to some extent though the ftir profiles for eps samples were similar the bands near 1630 and 1400 cm 1 associated with the stretching coo and co of carboxylic groups from pn and co stretching vibrations of peptide groups were observed to exist in all eps samples the intensities of these two bands decreased as the cod n ratio increased indicating the organic concentration was strongly related to the structure of pn the bands around 1630 cm 1 occurred obvious red shifts at high cod n ratios which suggested that cod n ratio increment contributed to the increase of α helix and the decrease of β sheets in pn 34 the slight peak movement from 1400 cm 1 to right was observed with cod n ratio arising representing the protonation of carboxyl groups protonated carboxyl groups furthermore were closely related to the accumulation of acidic substances humic acid fulvic acid etc and then increased hydrophilicity of zoogloea 35 by comparison the amide ii bands 1600 1500 cm 1 were weak for all the samples due to cn stretching and nh bending vibrations being consistent with the chemical analysis fig 2 protein associated functional groups were more abundant under low cod n ratios which might be responsible for the corresponding higher flocculating and settling properties moreover an obvious band near 1100 cm 1 correlated with the coc groups is indicative of the presence of ps the significant changes of intensity at 1100 and 3410 cm 1 further confirmed the higher amounts of ps could deteriorate the flocculation under high cod n ratios furthermore the bands at the fingerprint region are associated with phosphate groups which are considered as the functional groups of nucleic acid 36 concentrated humic compounds under high cod n ratios might intensify the ring vibrations of aromatic compounds near 570 cm 1 the high opo stretches in eps might stem from the releases of nucleic acids due to the insufficient availability of substrates for bacteria growth under low cod n ratios 3 4 effect of cod n ratio on microbial community structure and succession pyrosequencing of samples under different cod n ratios 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 yielded 31449 38293 28474 35868 44157 38414 41066 and 34959 effective sequences reads respectively for the sequences determined from the pyrosequencing 1303 1716 1347 1683 1648 1487 1423 and 1002 otus were identified with 97 98 similarity namely covering most of microorganisms the shannon indices an indicator of community diversity were 3 83 5 04 4 74 4 89 4 02 4 36 4 05 and 3 4 respectively a higher biodiversity represents a superior shock resistance performance of the system and relatively low cod n ratios cod n 0 5 2 are best for biodiversity however the system with concentrated organic matters e g cod n 10 still had a higher biodiversity than the system without external carbon source at the phylum level proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in all operating conditions accounting for about 70 26 95 32 of the total bacteria at the genus level the microbial compositions and the relative abundance of each genus were significantly influenced by cod n ratio fig 5 thauera 18 63 nitrosomona 12 34 chryseolinea 4 91 and ferruginibacter 4 21 were the dominant genera at the cod n ratio of 0 at the cod n ratios of 0 5 1 and 2 thauera 3 89 9 31 15 25 chryseolinea 8 76 9 11 9 89 brevundimonas 4 45 6 39 4 1 and portbacter 3 07 2 43 2 04 predominated the proportion of core genera was altered and shifted to a new set of dominant genera including thauera 22 42 dechloromonas 9 26 parcubacteria 8 04 and terrimonas 6 33 when the cod n ratio increased to 4 with the further elevation of cod n ratio to 6 8 and 10 the composition of the essential genera took corresponding changes whereby thauera 18 93 24 62 9 17 and azoarcus 11 57 4 14 8 58 were relatively abundant moreover meganema 16 67 became the most abundant genera at a cod n ratio of 10 which indicated that the sludge contained high levels of filamentous microorganisms in this condition as the cod n ratio increased the relative community abundance of most bacteria changed dramatically the abundance of denitrifying bacteria thauera increased notably as cod n ratio climbed from 0 5 to 8 leading to higher tn removal rates nonetheless it was noted that the denitrifying bacteria still predominated at the cod n ratio of 0 the reasons were microbial products excreted by nitrifiers could support the survival of heterotrophs in an oligotrophic sludge system and the existence of small amounts of heterotrophs could enhance the autotrophic ecosystem stability 20 besides the negligible discharge of excess sludge at low cod n ratios might also result in the high abundance of dead heterotrophic bacteria despite the fluctuation in abundance of nitrifying bacteria e g nitrosomonas nitrospira in addition an overall downward trend was exhibited with the increase of the cod n ratios table 1 an elevated level of cod n ratio could favour the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria but inhibited nitrifying bacteria aob amoa genes found in the ns varied between 1 61 105 and 1 59 108 copies mg mlss the relative abundance of aob was drastically reduced when the external carbon source existed which explained the scenario of nitrite accumulation the highest number of ammonia oxidizers was found at the cod n ratio of 0 corresponding to the highest nitrification rate furthermore the copy numbers of nitrospira like nob varied from 3 67 104 to 7 23 106 copies mg mlss the relative abundance of nitrospira significantly decreased under high cod n ratios however differed from aob the highest abundance of nitrospira was detected at a cod n ratio of 1 the effect of organic matter on the microbial community structure is complex several strains of nob had been verified to be capable of heterotrophic growth and their growth rates could be accelerated under mixotrophic condition 37 lücker et al 38 revealed that the adaptation of candidatus nitrospira defluvii to substrate limited conditions included an unusual periplasmic nitrite oxidoreductase based on nitrospira complete genome which was constitutively expressed and provided a pathway for the transport oxidation and assimilation of simple organic compounds that allowed a mixotrophic growth pattern the addition of appropriate amounts of organics was beneficial to nitrite oxidation nob had been hypothesized to utilize both cod and no2 n for growth 21 however nob was incompetent in metabolizing these two nutrients at high cod n ratios and was outgrown by heterotrophs investigations on the shifts in microbial communities are of vital importance to elucidate the physicochemical characteristics and eps production of ns under different nutritional conditions carbon starved conditions substantially enrich the nitrifiers these nitrifiers likely grow in dense microcolonies consist of very strong non detachable fraction and possess more hydrophobic and adhesive bacterial surfaces 36 moreover the structures of eps in the nitrifier flocs are also more hydrophobic less biodegradable and possess more abundant pn 23 29 according to its special characteristics eps can act as the backbone of floc structure hence enhancing the ns stability with the increase of cod n ratios the more organic carbon the more heterotrophic bacteria and filamentous microorganisms readily forming irregular floc morphology and causing significant disturbances to the growth and adhesion properties of nitrifying bacteria ps secreted under excessive influent organic conditions significantly aggrandized the surface hydrophilicity of flocs and finally brought about the deterioration of bioflocculation it was noted that concentrated organics stimulated the multiplication of polysaccharide secreting bacteria especially thauera chryseolinea and meganema which explained why polysaccharides abounded under high cod n ratios from a microbiological perspective the stable operation of ns systems under dynamic cod n ratio conditions will directly relate to the stability of microbial communities and consequently to microbial eps secretion nutrient removal and solid liquid separation 4 conclusions the shift of cod n ratios strongly influenced the stability of ns concerning nutrients removal biomass liquid separation eps production and microbial community the nitrification performance and biomass liquid separation were severely deteriorated by excessive organics a remarkable nitrite accumulation 6 6 17 75 mg no2 n l was observed when cod n ratio above 8 moreover insufficient and overload of organic substrates decreased the flocculation ability of 21 26 in ns system changes in cod n ratios resulted in a slight increase of total eps but considerable variations in eps compositions the pn contents slightly changed from 37 96 mg g vss to 42 8 mg g vss when decreasing the cod n ratio from 2 to 0 but gradually dropped below that of ps when the cod n ratio increased from 2 to 10 results of 3d eem and ftir spectra further implied that the variance of cod n ratio affected the functional groups and compositions of eps furthermore the elevated levels of cod n ratio favoured the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and polysaccharide secreting bacteria but inhibited nitrifying bacteria the presence of certain amounts of organic substrates was beneficial to maintaining microbial species diversity and proliferation of nitrospira the maximum shannon index 5 04 and the most copy number of nob 7 23 106 copies g mlss were obtained at the cod n ratio of 0 5 and 1 respectively the results from this study provide a better understanding of how cod n ratio would impact the stability of ns and may shed light on how to enhance the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment systems by

13512,the impacts of influent cod n ratios on the floc properties and microbial communities of nitrifying sludge under high strength ammonia conditions were investigated excessive organic loads severely deteriorated the nitrification rate and biomass liquid separation moreover both deficient and ample organic substrates affected the bioflocculation changes in cod n ratios resulted in considerable variations in the functional groups and compositions of extracellular polymeric substances eps the eps contents almost unchanged as decreasing the cod n ratio from 2 to 0 however the polysaccharides ps contents significantly surpassed that of proteins when cod n ratio increased from 2 to 10 tryptophan proteins like substances were the prominent constituents in eps but the intensities tapered off with the increment of cod n ratio while more humic acid like substances generated under both extremely low and high cod n ratio situations structural changes of eps constituents were dominated by cod n ratio varying mass generation of hydrophilic functional groups related to polysaccharides significantly deteriorated flocculation furthermore the elevated level of cod n ratios favoured the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and polysaccharide secreting bacteria but inhibited nitrifying bacteria nevertheless the presence of certain amounts of organic substrates were beneficial to maintain microbial species diversity and proliferation of nitrospira keywords cod n ratio eps bioflocculation nitrifying sludge microbial community 1 introduction large amounts of high ammonia wastewater have been discharged through industrial and agricultural production it is necessary to remove ammonia from wastewater to prevent water bodies from eutrophication biological nitrogen removal process bnrp is a highly promising method of treating high strength ammonia wastewater for its multiple advantages which include high economic efficiency limited secondary pollution and simple operation 1 with a slow growth rate and a small proportion of microbial aggregates nitrifying bacteria was vulnerable to environmental conditions resulting in the nitrification process constantly to be the rate limiting step of bnrp 2 because of the variations in influents and process operations the bnrp is often operated under unsteady conditions the irregular changes in substrate composition and flow rate cause the fluctuation of organic loading rates olrs in nitrifying sludge ns systems 3 as a critical parameter for nitrification processes cod n ratio is decisive for the physiological properties of microorganisms and chemical compositions of biomass in activated sludge 4 the unstable cod n ratios operational conditions often cause severe deterioration in treatment performance and sludge water separation of sludge system 5 thus far vast attentions have been paid to the effect of cod n ratio on nitrogen removal and floc characteristics in conventional activated sludge cas processes treating municipal wastewater 1 6 however the study on the effect of cod n ratio shock on the floc physicochemical characteristics and microbial community of ns exposed to high concentrations of ammonia is definitely limited 4 6 under high strength ammonia conditions the nutrient removal bioflocculation and microflora would be damaged because the activities of functional microorganisms were restrained by free ammonia 7 8 therefore a comprehensive insight into the consequence of influent cod n ratio on floc physicochemical characteristics and microbial colonies of ns under high strength ammonia wastewater conditions is essential for maintaining highly efficient treatment of bnrp process recently a profound emphasis is given to cod n ratio in relation to extracellular polymeric substances eps eps are the key structural materials of microbial aggregates and the characteristics of eps greatly determine the floc structure surface properties flocculability settleability dewaterability and adsorption ability of bioaggregates 9 15 some investigators unfolded that restricted cod n ratios benefited the secretion of total eps 16 17 while others held a contrary opinion or independent viewpoint 13 18 to date the influence of cod n ratio on the eps production and floc physicochemical characteristics in cas is not yet unified even less in ns system it is difficult to generalize how does cod n ratio impact on eps characteristics of ns based on previous studies due to the variances of operating conditions activated sludge characteristics and evaluation methods in addition sludge property and microbial community have been proved to be interrelated which are also dependent on cod n ratio this is mainly owing to the different substrate affinity metabolic activity resistance and even eps secretion characteristics exhibited by various microorganisms 19 microbial colony not only determines the treatment performance but also the stability of ns it is widely considered that heterotrophs are disadvantageous to nitrifiers because heterotrophs are more competitive in the ammonia and oxygen than nitrifiers 1 however an opposite view has also been proposed that the existence of heterotrophic bacteria can ensure the stability of the autotrophic ecosystem and enhance the activity of the nitrifiers 20 22 besides the variations of cod n ratio significantly affect the microbial population and correspond to the eps production which is believed to contribute to sludge instability 20 hitherto the effect of cod n ratio on the eps production floc physicochemical characteristics and microbial communities on ns is still unclear considering the significance of eps and microbial communities in biological wastewater treatment processes further investigations are a requisite for elucidating the impact of influent cod n ratios on eps production and microbial community structure in ns under high ammonia environment the objective of this study is to unfold the impacts of influent cod n ratios on the variability of floc physicochemical characteristics of ns under high strength ammonia conditions including the nitrification performance biomass liquid separation eps production and microbial populations findings from this study would be valuable for the enhancement of the stability of ns treating high strength ammonia wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge systems the experiment was conducted in eight sequencing batch reactors sbrs each with a working volume of 5 l the reactors were seeded with sludge obtained from the aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant in xi an china the sludge in each reactor was well suspended by continuous aeration from the bottom using stone air diffusers mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations were kept at 2500 mg l moreover do concentrations in each reactor were maintained above 4 mg l at the end of reaction the ph and temperature were controlled at 7 5 and 28 respectively the reactors r1 r8 were operated in a 24 hr cycle mode including 30 min feeding 780 min oxic conditions 120 min settling 30 min drawing and 480 min idling the reactors were each fed once a day with 2 5 l synthetic high strength ammonia wastewater the influent ammonia concentrations and ammonia loading rate were fixed at 200 mg l and 0 033 kg nh4 n kg mlss d respectively a certain amount of activated sludge was discharged daily to keep the srt of each reactor at the range of 15 25 d according to sludge loading initially the reactors were operated at the cod n ratio of 2 for 60 days to achieve the steady state of ns subsequently the cod n ratio was varied from 2 to 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 the organic loading rate was changed from 0 067 to 0 0 017 0 033 0 067 0 133 0 200 0 267 0 333 kg cod kg mlss d for another 60 days respectively constituents per litre of the synthetic wastewater are shown as follows 764 29 mg nh4cl 175 6 mg kh2po4 60 mg mgso4 7h2o 18 mg cacl2 and 0 38 ml trace metal solution the carbon content was adjusted by modifying the amount of sodium acetate in the influent to vary the cod n ratio 2 2 eps extraction and composition analysis a heat extraction method was used to extract eps from ns as reported previously 23 the sludge samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min to remove the bulk solution after discarding the supernatant the remaining sludge pellets were washed and resuspended to their original volume with saline water 0 05 nacl solution the mixed liquor of each sample was then subjected to a heat treatment at 60 for 30 min and centrifuged again at 12 000 rpm for 15 min the eps was finally obtained by filtering the centrifuged mixed liquor using 0 22 μm membranes toc was measured by a toc analyser shimadzu toc l japan the measurement of dna was in accordance with the diphenylamine colorimetric method and proteins pn and polysaccharides ps were determined by the lowry and the anthrone method respectively 24 the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra of eps were surveyed by fluorescence spectrometer fp 6500 jasco corporation japan and ftir spectrometer irprestige 21 shimadzu japan respectively 2 3 water quality and sludge physical property analysis levels of cod total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh4 n mlss and sludge volume index svi were measured according to the standard methods 25 the specific nitrification rate snr was calculated on the basis of nh4 n conversion during one reaction period the sludge morphology was examined with scanning electron microscope jsm 6510lv japan and microscope nikon 90i japan filamentous organism content was quantified as filament index using the method described by jenkins et al 26 a laser particle size distribution analyser ls230 beckman coulter us was used to determine the floc size distribution the sludge flocculation and dewaterability were characterized by flocculating ability fa and specific resistance of the filtration srf following the method of jin et al 11 and li and yang 27 respectively all parameters described above were detected in triplicate 2 4 analysis of microbial community by high throughput 454 pyrosequencing the dna extracted from the samples collected from the sludge system was amplified by pcr using primers 341 f 5 barcode cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 barcode gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 pcr reactions were done in triplicate 30 μl mixtures containing 15 μl of 2 taq master

triplicate experiments the statistical analysis was conducted with spss 19 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of cod n ratio on nutrient removal variation of cod n ratio in the ns process significantly influenced the performance of nutrient removal fig 1 in general effluent cod concentrations were positively related to cod n ratios the removal of cod increased with the cod n ratio elevating and remained stable at 80 when cod n ratio exceeded 4 in contrast concentrations of the effluent nh4 n and no2 n were negligible and tn existed mainly in the form of no3 n at low cod n ratios an obvious accumulation of no2 n was detected in the effluent at the cod n ratio of 8 and nh4 n remained with a further increase of cod n ratio to 10 high substrate concentration hampered do diffusion and then caused the partial limitation of do the enzymatic system involved in nitrification especially that of nob is sensitive to do concentration that is why much more no2 n than nh4 n accumulated under high cod n ratios 1 moreover the oxygen stress at high cod n ratios caused a reduction of activity in ammonia oxidation the snr decreased dramatically from 28 06 2 02 6 48 0 73 mg nh4 n g vss h when the cod n ratio was raised from 0 to 10 this agreed with the washout of nitrifying bacteria under high cod n ratios table 1 furthermore simultaneous denitrification occurred in all sludge systems whereby denitrification efficiency was dramatically enhanced with the enrichment of electron donors 3 2 effects of cod n ratio on sludge physical properties of ns changes in cod n ratios resulted in marked variations in sludge floc structures compact and smooth shaped flocs were observed in low cod n ratio systems while porous and rough shaped flocs dominated in high cod n ratio systems although most of the sludge had a low level 1 2 levels of filamentous microorganisms excessive proliferation of filamentous microorganism 3 4 levels was found in the sludge at cod n ratios of 8 and 10 overall the mean floc size remained stable when cod n ratio was less than 2 but gradually increased to 110 9 2 7 μm as the cod n ratio climbed to 10 table 2 this result further demonstrates that large mean floc sizes are associated with high cod n ratios 6 9 it is generally believed that filamentous microorganisms could act as a backbone for floc formation thereby increasing the floc size 4 the porous floc structure and abundant filamentous bacteria led to the increase of floc sizes in the ns however the impacts of cod n ratio on flocs size were inconsistent in reported literature 4 6 9 11 18 28 this divergence might be related to the different types of activated sludge operating conditions and range of cod n ratio the sludge flocculation and dewaterability characteristics were desirable at the phase of cod n 2 but worsened with further uplift in cod n ratio table 2 the flocculation and dewaterability of sludge were influenced slightly when the cod n ratio decreased from 2 to 0 on the other hand when the cod n ratio increased from 2 to 10 the fa decreased and srf increased significantly leading to severe deterioration in flocculation and dewaterability of the sludge this finding provides additional support that the sludge bioflocculation and dewaterability worsens after a high cod n ratio is imposed 5 moreover the settleability of sludge was excellent under the low cod n conditions but significant deterioration occurred when cod n ratio above 4 the svi increased dramatically to 238 4 14 2 ml g at a cod n ratio of 6 generally a low degree of settleability is related to weakly flocculated sludge flocs formed by tiny flocs or flocs with high levels of filamentous bacteria 29 in this study loose floc structure with high numbers of filamentous organisms was observed which might be directly related to the deterioration of sludge settleability at high cod n ratios the results above indicate that the shock of cod n ratio has an adverse impact on floc structure and biosolids water separation of ns the sludge presented a dense structure at low cod n ratios accompanied by an excellent nitrification rate but when the ns was cultivated without organics the growth of ns could be restrained causing unstable biomass due to the lack of electron donor besides when the ns was cultured under high cod n conditions the do diffusion was limited in flocs and easily formed irregular floc morphology the floc structure was closely related to the microbial community it was suggested that nitrifiers tended to exist in dense zoogloea of flocs while heterotrophic bacteria were likely to grow in irregular morphology 26 therefore it can be inferred that the variance of cod n ratio might bring about significant disturbance to the proliferation of nitrifiers under high ammonia conditions consequently leading to the deterioration of nitrification performance and biomass liquid separation 3 3 effect of cod n ratio on eps production and components 3 3 1 compositions of eps eps refer to the biopolymers formed by cells attached to the surface of flocs the contents of pn and ps in eps were measured under different cod n ratios the shift of cod n ratios resulted in considerable variations in the constituents of eps fig 2 a slight increase in total bound eps was detected after the cod n ratio change was imposed the rather consistent levels of total eps under different process conditions are in line with the other observations 5 27 28 as a predominant component in each reactor the contents of pn were nearly constant under low cod n ratios cod n 0 2 but gradually dropped below that of ps when cod n ratio increased from 2 to 10 moreover the contents of dna in eps did not change significantly stabilizing at about 3 5 mg g vss which indicated that bacterial cells were not destroyed during the eps extraction process hence a negative correlation was found between cod n and pn ps ratio which provided additional support to that sludge growing in wastewater with low cod n ratios tended to produce eps with a high pn ps ratio 13 27 29 the present study demonstrated that the proportion of pn and ps in eps was significantly affected by organic substrates and certified that under high cod n ratios bacteria tended to convert excess carbon substrates into extracellular storage compounds such as ps in eps in ns system conversely at low cod n ratios most organics were used in biomass synthesis instead of ps secretion and intracellular pn would be released due to increased lysis and endogenous respiration besides the decreased pn ps ratio under high cod n ratios was significantly correlated with the deterioration of sludge flocculation settleability and dewaterability anova p 0 05 the decisive role of pn ps in bioflocculation was consistent with previous findings 6 28 29 the cod n ratio considerably affected microbial metabolisms and hence on the eps production to date although several reports are published on the relationship between cod n and eps a predetermined favourable cod n ratio has not been determined in the literature this lack of predetermined cod n might be due to the specific types of sludge reported 4 6 eps in sludge would be stable if operating conditions were beneficial to the microbial community but its production changed significantly under adverse conditions supposedly bacteria in microbial aggregates were likely to generate more eps under unfavourable conditions 3 the stable operation of ns system under dynamic cod n ratio conditions is essential for the secretion of microbial eps moreover the constituents of eps played important roles in microbial adhesion and aggregation processes 11 18 27 29 but the specific influence of individual eps components on the flocculation of microbial aggregates was still unclear for further studies it may be essential to characterize the constituents of eps on a molecular basis that characterization would give more detailed insight into the mechanisms involved in the bioflocculation process 3 3 2 eem spectra of eps fig 3 shows the 3d eem spectra of eps extracted from ns under different cod n ratios it was observed that not only the major fluorescence substances but also the fluorescence intensities of eps samples varied with changes in cod n ratio three fluorescence peaks peak a b and c were readily identified from the eem spectra peak a observed at ex em wavelengths of 230 240 330 355 nm referred to aromatic pn like substances peak b 280 290 330 360 nm represented the tryptophan pn like substances and peak c 350 360 420 430 nm was associated with humic acid like substances 30 31 similar fluorescence patterns for aromatic peak a and b were observed under different cod n ratio conditions suggesting that the constituents of the pn like substances might be ubiquitous in ns 31 in terms of the fluorescence intensity peak b tryptophan pn like substances was found to be the prominent peak in the eem spectra of eps which corresponded well to the result that pn was the major component of eps a large number of exoenzymes present in the eps matrix might be the reason why pn was dominant in eps 27 moreover the fluorescence intensities of peak a and peak b gradually decreased as the cod n ratios increased which was corroborated that pn contents were decreased by the photometric analysis unlike pn like substances changes in cod n ratio had significant bearing on the production of humic acid like substances the fluorescence intensities of humic acid like substances peak c strengthened when the cod n ratio changed from 2 to other operation conditions the production of humic acid like substances in eps is generally related to the decomposition of dead cells and macromolecular organics 30 32 this finding suggested that the uncomfortable conditions that increased cell lysis under low cod n ratios and decreased microorganism activities under high cod n ratios which in turn produced more humic acid humic compounds have been considered as a key constituent in eps however their special functions in bioflocculation have not been exactly explained 24 it was reported that humic compounds could be used as electron donors or acceptors to exert redox activity in microbial aggregates 33 nonetheless some others suggested that the humic acid like materials were likely to deteriorate the sludge flocculation 9 24 30 which reasonably explains the deteriorated flocculability in this study 3 3 3 ftir spectra of eps the influence of cod n ratio on the potential dominant functional groups in eps was investigated by ftir analysis as shown in fig 4 the eps possessed various absorption bands in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 the functional groups can be classified into four categories including hydrocarbons proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids 23 a broad stretching band that appeared at 3200 3600 cm 1 was associated with the oh groups of carbohydrates the ftir within 1800 400 cm 1 region can be apart into six main regions 1700 1600 cm 1 amide i region 1600 1500 cm 1 amide ii region 1300 1200 cm 1 amide iii region 1500 1300 cm 1 carboxylic group containing and hydrocarbon like compounds 1200 900 cm 1 nucleic acids and polysaccharides and 900 400 cm 1 fingerprint region 23 32 in accordance with previous studies different kinds of bands presented in almost all regions of the ftir some delicate differences proved the changes in flocculability of ns to some extent though the ftir profiles for eps samples were similar the bands near 1630 and 1400 cm 1 associated with the stretching coo and co of carboxylic groups from pn and co stretching vibrations of peptide groups were observed to exist in all eps samples the intensities of these two bands decreased as the cod n ratio increased indicating the organic concentration was strongly related to the structure of pn the bands around 1630 cm 1 occurred obvious red shifts at high cod n ratios which suggested that cod n ratio increment contributed to the increase of α helix and the decrease of β sheets in pn 34 the slight peak movement from 1400 cm 1 to right was observed with cod n ratio arising representing the protonation of carboxyl groups protonated carboxyl groups furthermore were closely related to the accumulation of acidic substances humic acid fulvic acid etc and then increased hydrophilicity of zoogloea 35 by comparison the amide ii bands 1600 1500 cm 1 were weak for all the samples due to cn stretching and nh bending vibrations being consistent with the chemical analysis fig 2 protein associated functional groups were more abundant under low cod n ratios which might be responsible for the corresponding higher flocculating and settling properties moreover an obvious band near 1100 cm 1 correlated with the coc groups is indicative of the presence of ps the significant changes of intensity at 1100 and 3410 cm 1 further confirmed the higher amounts of ps could deteriorate the flocculation under high cod n ratios furthermore the bands at the fingerprint region are associated with phosphate groups which are considered as the functional groups of nucleic acid 36 concentrated humic compounds under high cod n ratios might intensify the ring vibrations of aromatic compounds near 570 cm 1 the high opo stretches in eps might stem from the releases of nucleic acids due to the insufficient availability of substrates for bacteria growth under low cod n ratios 3 4 effect of cod n ratio on microbial community structure and succession pyrosequencing of samples under different cod n ratios 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 and 10 yielded 31449 38293 28474 35868 44157 38414 41066 and 34959 effective sequences reads respectively for the sequences determined from the pyrosequencing 1303 1716 1347 1683 1648 1487 1423 and 1002 otus were identified with 97 98 similarity namely covering most of microorganisms the shannon indices an indicator of community diversity were 3 83 5 04 4 74 4 89 4 02 4 36 4 05 and 3 4 respectively a higher biodiversity represents a superior shock resistance performance of the system and relatively low cod n ratios cod n 0 5 2 are best for biodiversity however the system with concentrated organic matters e g cod n 10 still had a higher biodiversity than the system without external carbon source at the phylum level proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in all operating conditions accounting for about 70 26 95 32 of the total bacteria at the genus level the microbial compositions and the relative abundance of each genus were significantly influenced by cod n ratio fig 5 thauera 18 63 nitrosomona 12 34 chryseolinea 4 91 and ferruginibacter 4 21 were the dominant genera at the cod n ratio of 0 at the cod n ratios of 0 5 1 and 2 thauera 3 89 9 31 15 25 chryseolinea 8 76 9 11 9 89 brevundimonas 4 45 6 39 4 1 and portbacter 3 07 2 43 2 04 predominated the proportion of core genera was altered and shifted to a new set of dominant genera including thauera 22 42 dechloromonas 9 26 parcubacteria 8 04 and terrimonas 6 33 when the cod n ratio increased to 4 with the further elevation of cod n ratio to 6 8 and 10 the composition of the essential genera took corresponding changes whereby thauera 18 93 24 62 9 17 and azoarcus 11 57 4 14 8 58 were relatively abundant moreover meganema 16 67 became the most abundant genera at a cod n ratio of 10 which indicated that the sludge contained high levels of filamentous microorganisms in this condition as the cod n ratio increased the relative community abundance of most bacteria changed dramatically the abundance of denitrifying bacteria thauera increased notably as cod n ratio climbed from 0 5 to 8 leading to higher tn removal rates nonetheless it was noted that the denitrifying bacteria still predominated at the cod n ratio of 0 the reasons were microbial products excreted by nitrifiers could support the survival of heterotrophs in an oligotrophic sludge system and the existence of small amounts of heterotrophs could enhance the autotrophic ecosystem stability 20 besides the negligible discharge of excess sludge at low cod n ratios might also result in the high abundance of dead heterotrophic bacteria despite the fluctuation in abundance of nitrifying bacteria e g nitrosomonas nitrospira in addition an overall downward trend was exhibited with the increase of the cod n ratios table 1 an elevated level of cod n ratio could favour the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria but inhibited nitrifying bacteria aob amoa genes found in the ns varied between 1 61 105 and 1 59 108 copies mg mlss the relative abundance of aob was drastically reduced when the external carbon source existed which explained the scenario of nitrite accumulation the highest number of ammonia oxidizers was found at the cod n ratio of 0 corresponding to the highest nitrification rate furthermore the copy numbers of nitrospira like nob varied from 3 67 104 to 7 23 106 copies mg mlss the relative abundance of nitrospira significantly decreased under high cod n ratios however differed from aob the highest abundance of nitrospira was detected at a cod n ratio of 1 the effect of organic matter on the microbial community structure is complex several strains of nob had been verified to be capable of heterotrophic growth and their growth rates could be accelerated under mixotrophic condition 37 lücker et al 38 revealed that the adaptation of candidatus nitrospira defluvii to substrate limited conditions included an unusual periplasmic nitrite oxidoreductase based on nitrospira complete genome which was constitutively expressed and provided a pathway for the transport oxidation and assimilation of simple organic compounds that allowed a mixotrophic growth pattern the addition of appropriate amounts of organics was beneficial to nitrite oxidation nob had been hypothesized to utilize both cod and no2 n for growth 21 however nob was incompetent in metabolizing these two nutrients at high cod n ratios and was outgrown by heterotrophs investigations on the shifts in microbial communities are of vital importance to elucidate the physicochemical characteristics and eps production of ns under different nutritional conditions carbon starved conditions substantially enrich the nitrifiers these nitrifiers likely grow in dense microcolonies consist of very strong non detachable fraction and possess more hydrophobic and adhesive bacterial surfaces 36 moreover the structures of eps in the nitrifier flocs are also more hydrophobic less biodegradable and possess more abundant pn 23 29 according to its special characteristics eps can act as the backbone of floc structure hence enhancing the ns stability with the increase of cod n ratios the more organic carbon the more heterotrophic bacteria and filamentous microorganisms readily forming irregular floc morphology and causing significant disturbances to the growth and adhesion properties of nitrifying bacteria ps secreted under excessive influent organic conditions significantly aggrandized the surface hydrophilicity of flocs and finally brought about the deterioration of bioflocculation it was noted that concentrated organics stimulated the multiplication of polysaccharide secreting bacteria especially thauera chryseolinea and meganema which explained why polysaccharides abounded under high cod n ratios from a microbiological perspective the stable operation of ns systems under dynamic cod n ratio conditions will directly relate to the stability of microbial communities and consequently to microbial eps secretion nutrient removal and solid liquid separation 4 conclusions the shift of cod n ratios strongly influenced the stability of ns concerning nutrients removal biomass liquid separation eps production and microbial community the nitrification performance and biomass liquid separation were severely deteriorated by excessive organics a remarkable nitrite accumulation 6 6 17 75 mg no2 n l was observed when cod n ratio above 8 moreover insufficient and overload of organic substrates decreased the flocculation ability of 21 26 in ns system changes in cod n ratios resulted in a slight increase of total eps but considerable variations in eps compositions the pn contents slightly changed from 37 96 mg g vss to 42 8 mg g vss when decreasing the cod n ratio from 2 to 0 but gradually dropped below that of ps when the cod n ratio increased from 2 to 10 results of 3d eem and ftir spectra further implied that the variance of cod n ratio affected the functional groups and compositions of eps furthermore the elevated levels of cod n ratio favoured the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria and polysaccharide secreting bacteria but inhibited nitrifying bacteria the presence of certain amounts of organic substrates was beneficial to maintaining microbial species diversity and proliferation of nitrospira the maximum shannon index 5 04 and the most copy number of nob 7 23 106 copies g mlss were obtained at the cod n ratio of 0 5 and 1 respectively the results from this study provide a better understanding of how cod n ratio would impact the stability of ns and may shed light on how to enhance the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment systems by manipulating the influent composition of wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements this study is supported by the natural science

13513,this study examined 9066 publications on the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps published between 1998 and 2019 through a bibliometric approach based on the scie and ssci databases the overall research distribution of ppcps characteristics of pollutants water pollution types and up to date treatment technologies were revealed the results showed that the number of articles relating to the removal of ppcps increased significantly with china contributing the most followed by the united states and spain water research is the most productive journal and the h index is the highest 110 five clusters were identified from the keyword network namely polluted water types biological treatment adsorption advanced oxidation and membrane treatment technology through the elaboration of clustering and its relationship it was found that research and development of technologies were the main concerns and the application of adsorption technology was the most extensive the most commonly used adsorbent is carbon material while nanomaterial and biomaterial adsorbent are promising these findings help to identify the global trend of ppcps removal and provide valuable references for further research in this area keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products bibliometric cluster analysis treatment technology adsorption 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps refer to the pollutions caused by daily products used for personal health and beauty care including antibiotics anti inflammatory drugs painkillers birth control pills weight reducing drugs perfumes disinfectants developing agent as well as other medicines and daily necessities 1 2 researchers have detected various ppcps in different environmental settings such as groundwater surface water drinking water sewage treatment plants sludge and sediments 3 this included 19 ppcps in a wastewater recycling facility georgia usa 4 11 ppcps in barnacle samples saudi red sea 5 and 9 ppcps in a drinking water treatment plant and a pilot plant ontario canada 6 in water environment the concentration of ppcps is relatively low generally in the range of ng l μg l it is less likely to cause an acute contamination events in a relatively short period of time most of the ppcps are transported to wastewater treatment plants after being excreted in the form of urine and feces 7 without specifical removal process a certain amount of ppcps will enter the surface water or groundwater environment with the effluent from the sewage plant 8 irrigation by surface water may lead to the uptake and bioaccumulation of ppcps in the edible parts of crops 9 in addition ppcps in surface water will also flow into the ocean during the runoff even in the antarctic and arctic regions 10 11 ppcps can also be detected due to the continuous accumulation in environment ppcps will cause potential harm to the ecological environment and public health because of strong biological activity bioaccumulation and difficult degradation 12 this phenomenon can also lead to the development of a large number of resistant bacteria and the occurrence of resistance genes in the aquatic environment 13 14 many studies have shown that long exposure of low concentrations of ppcps in the environment may hurt lower organisms such as algae and fish 15 16 this damage caused by ppcps may come from the inhibition of related enzyme activities in the organism and the impact on gene expression 17 19 diclofenac a commonly consumed anti inflammatory drug can cause oxidative damage to freshwater fish rhamdia quelen s organs by reducing the activity of superoxide dismutase and phase i biotransformation enzyme in the testis and liver of fish it is also detrimental to fish health by reducing the concentration of some neurotransmitters such as 3 4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid dopac and dopamine 20 moreover some ppcps are known to accumulate in and may be biomagnified through biological food consumption 21 in australia platypus consume half of the average human daily dose of antidepressants by eating aquatic invertebrate prey 22 diclofenac was the main cause of the population of asian gyps vultures declines vultures die from kidney failure caused by the accumulation of diclofenac which comes from the carcasses of livestock 23 some metabolites of ppcps remain the toxicity or are more toxic than the original ppcps for example the toxicity of the diclofenac photo transformation products is 5 6 times higher than that of its parent in algal reproduction tests 24 2 2 chlorophenyl amino benzaldehyde cpab as one photo transformation product of the pharmaceutical diclofenac has been identified to be more toxic to green algae scenedesmus vacuolatus due to its stronger hydrophobicity 25 different kinds of ppcps may generate various toxic effects on aquatic organisms the synergistic and antagonistic effects caused by the mixing of multiple ppcps may affect the degree of interference with nerves antioxidant defense metabolic and other system of the organism and even produce more complex toxic effects 26 27 exposure to diclofenac significantly increased the induction of acetylcholinesterase ache activity in carassius carassius while the mixture of diclofenac and carbamazepine significantly reduced the ache activity in carassius carassius causing potential neurotoxicity 28 ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin were selected to conduct toxicity experiments for freshwater algae chlorella vulgaris the toxic mixture effects of all tested chemicals were higher than the individual effect of each mixture component due to the strong synergism 29 the mixture of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole also showed higher toxicity toward the model organisms 30 considering the complexity of ppcps the existence of multiple ppcps will bring greater potential risk to aquatic organisms and ecosystems 31 32 ppcps removal technologies are developing with the detections of new emerging pollutants and the advancement of science and technology 33 a few studies have recently reported the current knowledge on toxicity of ppcps and the research progress of several certain technologies on ppcps removal such as algae based technologies 34 biosorption techniques with different biowaste compounds 35 and photodegradation 36 godoy and kummrow provided the ecotoxicology of ppcps mixtures including 194 assessments of the toxicity 37 the researchers summarized the mechanisms of pollutants removal and the fate of ppcps in algae based treatment systems which have potentials in ppcps removal 34 bioadsorbents derived from the bio wastes has enabled ppcps removal process to be economical and to achieve the reuse of solid wastes 35 visible light driven tio2 based heterojunctions and carbonaceous tio2 composites for ppcps degradation are both competitive in tio2 based photocatalysis processes schottky and z scheme heterojunctions are found to be effective due to their efficient separation of charge carriers and the occurrence of redox reactions at a relatively higher redox potential 38 the combination of carbonaceous materials e g activated carbon carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets with tio2 can significantly improve the performance of ppcps removal from aqueous solution 36 in fact besides above the information regarding ppcps types and treatment technologies are enormous especially currently more efforts have been devoted to the pollution control of ppcps all over the world therefore it is of great significance to analyze the characteristics of ppcps and the development trend of related removal technologies by the literature metrology bibliometrics is a measurement science in the process of information transmission which can be used to analyze and evaluate the influence and development trend of research objects 39 40 as far as we know there is no relative research on ppcps removal based on the bibliometrics analysis in the present study bibliometrics analysis will be used to explore the research hotspots and the objectives are to 1 discover the patterns and trends of ppcps removal through a comprehensive analysis of publication types languages countries regions institutions journals subject categories h index and other parameters according to the selected publications over the past 22 years 2 comprehensively analyze the co occurrence keywords network from the clusters of water types main ppcps types and mainstream treatment technologies the findings will provide valuable references for the way forward in scientific research 2 methodology 2 1 data sources the database selected for this study is the science citation index extension scie and the social science citation index ssci both of which are derived from the web of science core collection scie is an extended version of sci that contains more than 9000 journals and is the most commonly used data source for scientific research 41 the keywords selected in this study were pharmaceutical and removal personal care product and removal which were used to retrieve the titles keywords abstracts journals selected and other information in these two databases from 1998 to 2019 2 2 data analysis bibliometrics uses statistical methods to quantitatively analyze the literature information retrieved in this study the summary statistics of basic information article type language country keywords journals etc are used in microsoft excel 2013 in social network analysis the reading of data is done by bibexcel and a co word matrix is generated on this basis gephi software 0 9 2 is used to complete the network diagram of collaboration or co occurrence between different objects the graph consists of lines between nodes each node represents an individual and the line represents the relationship between different nodes the two most widely used evaluation indicators in this study were h index and impact factor if h index was proposed by physicist george hirsch in 2005 and can be used to evaluate academic output and academic achievements of researchers countries institutions journals etc if is the data in the journal citation report jcr produced by thomson reuters and is an important indicator of the quality and display of journals this study obtained the if 2019 from the isi website to analyze the quality of the journal 3 results and discussion 3 1 general statistics to investigate the publication characteristics and research trends of ppcps a total of 9066 articles published between 1998 and 2019 were evaluated of the 9066 publications retrieved from the databases articles took the biggest share with 92 16 8355 therefore only articles were further analyzed in this research articles related to ppcps removal in the databases were written in 11 different languages vast majority of these articles were written in english with 8277 records accounting for 99 07 the other languages accounted for a very low percentage indicating english is the main language in this field of ppcps in any country the number of publications increased steadily over the past 22 years and the articles increased to nearly 84 times in 2019 compared to 1998 as shown in fig 1 a total citation showed an increasing trend from 1998 to 2009 and reached the peak in 2009 with a record of 19318 after 2009 the trend changed and the number declined year by year the reason for this phenomenon is the time required for the accumulated effects of new publications a total of 8355 articles were published in 956 journals of these periodicals 837 87 55 published less than 10 articles the top 20 most productive journals published more than half of the total number of articles 50 86 table s1 summarizes the relevant information of the top 20 most productive journals tp if h index the number of publications on water research was the largest 554 6 63 followed by science of the total environment 482 5 77 chemosphere 471 5 64 chemical engineering journal 401 4 80 the impact factor if and h index are used to quantitatively measure the performance of various journals generally journals with high impact factors also have relatively high h index for example water research which has the highest output has the highest impact factor 9 130 and h index also ranks first 110 however there are anomalies desalination water science and technology have the similar h index 37 and 35 but the impact factors are very different which are 7 098 and 1 638 respectively this may be caused by the specialization selectivity and novelty of the journal ppcps pollutants are mainly diffused through water discharges most of the studies on ppcps also focuses on the treatment in the water environment but are relatively less involved in sediments and soils as a top journal in the field water research paid attention to the related research of ppcps earlier and accordingly becoming the most productive journal fig 1b shows the time trend of the top 7 most productive periodicals from 1998 to 2019 as can be seen from the figure the number of articles published in the seven periodicals shows an overall growth trend among them the number of publications of water research and journal of hazardous materials fluctuated after 2010 but remained stable at a certain number with the number rising after 2014 the growth trend of chemical engineering journal chemosphere and science and the total environment are very obvious 3 2 analysis of countries regions and cooperation countries regions performance can be determined by analyzing the address and affiliation of the author provided by each article 42 among these 8355 articles only 2348 articles 28 10 included international cooperation from 1998 to 2019 a total of 118 countries published academic research articles in scie and ssci databases which showed that nearly 60 of the countries in the world published research articles in this field however the articles published by the top 20 countries accounted for 82 2 of the total table s2 lists the characteristic indicators of articles published in the top 20 countries regions the country with the largest number of published articles is china 1726 articles accounting for 20 66 of all reports followed by the united states 1295 articles spain 920 articles and germany 563 articles in terms of h index the top three places are the united states spain and china indicating that they have relatively high level of influence in this field fig 2 a shows the time trend of publishing articles in the top 10 countries regions from 1998 to 2019 as can be seen from the figure there is a general trend of growth in the total number of articles published each year in all countries studies on ppcps in european and american countries started earlier american scholars daughton and ternes first formally proposed the concept of ppcps in 1999 43 before 2013 the number of articles published in the united states basically ranked first with the economic development and population growth china has gradually become the world s largest producer and user of ppcps 44 various antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes have been widely detected in the environment their toxic effects have been verified and the treatment has also been deeply concerned by scholars in china more than 50 000 tons of 36 major pollutants entered the environment in 2013 45 in 2015 the state council of china issued the water pollution prevention and control action plan which further urged the importance for the protection of china s aquatic ecosystems 46 the plan required the evaluation of new pollutants including ppcps under the guidance of the national policy in combination with the actual situation of the continuous increase in the total amount of ppcps the number of relevant articles has increased steadily at a rate of more than 20 per year since 2014 this is also consistent with the changes in the number of publications in some journals shown in fig 1b after 2013 china surpassed the united states to become the most productive country nowadays the number of articles output in china has far exceeded other countries it may be attributed to that chinese government and citizens devote effort to the removal of ppcps and it also shows that chinese scholars have deepened and extensive research in this field in addition spain s article output also has outstanding realization after 2008 ranking third as shown in fig 2b the top 30 most productive countries regions are mainly divided into two parts the green area is the asia america cooperation network centering on china and the united states china has cooperation with the united states singapore australia britain and other countries especially with the united states the red area is the european cooperation network centering on spain and germany it can be seen that exchanges and cooperation between countries regions with near geographical locations are closer according to 8355 articles providing the author s address information a total of 5305 institutions contributed to the subject of ppcps more than 60 of these articles were created by authors from different institutions fig 2c depicts the time trend of the top 7 most productive research institutions as can be seen from the figure before 2006 7 research institutions had little research on ppcps removal since then the number of publications of 7 research institutions has gradually and steadily increased the increase in the number of publications of the chinese academy of sciences and tsinghua university is especially obvious especially after 2014 the number of publications far exceeds that of other institutions between 2007 and 2012 the number of articles published by estremadura university increased rapidly reaching its peak 12 articles in 2012 after that the number began to decline year by year this is the only institution with a declining trend in the number of publications through the social network diagram this paper analyzes the cooperation relationship between the top 30 most productive institutions in the field of ppcps removal from 1998 to 2019 as shown in fig 2d research institutions in the same country cooperate most closely such as those in singapore spain china and denmark among them the spanish csic gerona university and idaea csic have very strong cooperative relations which are represented by thicker lines the chinese academy of sciences is especially active in this field it not only has close cooperation with domestic universities but also maintains cooperative and exchange relations with institutions in singapore japan australia and canada it is the network center of blue region 3 3 analysis of keywords the keywords reflect the most important content in an article sorting out and analyzing the author keywords can effectively capture the hot spots of scientific research and help to understand and grasp the development trend in this field analyzing the changes of keywords in different periods is a common bibliometric method of the 8355 articles related to the removal of ppcps 1018 articles did not provide the author keywords so the 14 095 keywords provided by 7337 publications were finally analyzed among them a total of 10 660 75 63 keywords appeared only once 1500 10 64 keywords were used twice 583 4 14 keywords were used three times the high percentage of one time keywords showed the discontinuity and the universality of research focus in this field there were 461 3 27 keywords that appeared 10 times or more these high frequency keywords can better reflect the mainstream of research in the field of ppcps removal table 1 lists the changes of the top 30 keywords in the four phases 1998 2004 2004 2009 2010 2014 2015 2019 pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical and removal are the words used in this study to retrieve articles in the database so they can be ignored as can be seen from table 1 key words in the top 7 are adsorption 680 9 27 wastewater 459 6 26 wastewater treatment 332 4 53 biodegradation 299 4 08 antibiotics 267 3 64 photocatalysis 241 3 28 and ozonation 220 3 00 this indicated that adsorption biological treatment photocatalysis and advanced oxidation are the mainstream treatment technologies in the field of ppcps removal among them adsorption rose from 22nd in 1998 to 2nd in 2019 which shows that adsorption is deeply concerned as an effective treatment technology for drugs and personal care products in water the ranking of biodegradation rose from 15th in 2004 2009 to 5th in 2015 2019 indicating the economical and extensive application of biological treatment technologies however the ranking of ozonation showed a slow downward trend falling from the 5th in 2004 2009 to the 15th in 2015 2019 while photocatalysis an advanced oxidation rose from the 27th in 2004 2009 to the 6th in 2015 2019 which may be caused by the diversity of advanced oxidation technologies in addition there is also a significant decline in the ranking of processing technologies with nanofiltration falling from 4th in 2004 2009 to 30th in 2015 2019 although the membrane treatment technology has high efficiency the relatively low economic benefits make it limited in researches among the keywords antibiotics ranked 5th has been stable from 1998 to 2019 which shows that the universality of antibiotics have always been a hot research topic in the field of ppcps removal detailed to the specific drugs such as diclofenac carbamazepine and ibuprofen are ranked 8th 14th and 17th among the keywords respectively kinetics has also received more attention rising from 16th in 2004 2009 to 9th in 2015 2019 indicating that analyzing the removal mechanism of ppcps pollution is also one of the concerns with the progress of science and technology and the improvement of detection technology many low content substances that were previously undetectable in water began to be discovered slowly therefore the rankings of micropollutants and emerging contaminants increased significantly year by year from 20th and 35th in 2004 2009 to 11th and 10th in 2015 2019 respectively it is known that drug abuse and prolonged exposure to antibiotics can lead to endocrine disorders in human bodies in severe cases it can cause drug resistance lack of medication and even serious consequences of teratogenic carcinogenic and mutagenic effects 47 49 therefore there are more articles concerning toxicity and the ranking has also risen from 35th to 10th bibexcel software was used to generate a common word matrix and the top 100 high frequency author keywords were selected to carry out clustering analysis based on gephi 0 9 2 software the co occurrence keywords network revealed the focuses of the researches which can be found in detail in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 five words clusters were found from the co occurrence keywords network polluted water types advanced oxidation adsorption biological treatment and membrane treatment technology according to the classification the detailed discussion will follow two main parts of pollution types and analysis of treatment technologies 3 3 1 pollution types 3 3 1 1 polluted water types the keywords refer to a variety of water types associated with ppcps such as wastewater drinking water surface water municipal wastewater hospital wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater in a populated city pollutants from shampoo hair dye and oral cleaning products all used in daily life are collected into municipal wastewater which is an important source of pollutants for personal care products hospitals and pharmaceutical factories produce the most pollutants related to drugs in the process of using and producing drugs fig 4 shows the concentration of some typical ppcps in different polluted water types including hospital wastewater 50 municipal wastewater 51 industrial wastewater 52 surface water 53 and groundwater 54 studies have shown that the removal of some antibiotics by the existing sewage treatment process is not obvious 55 59 the treated wastewater still contains residual antibiotics and eventually flows into surface water which becomes a major threat to the recycling of water resources 52 60 wang et al 61 detected 28 ppcps from urban river water samples collected from beijing changzhou and shenzhen various ppcps contaminants were found in both dendritic and cyclical water networks 62 with the increased safety requirements for drinking water the trace pollutants detected should also be concerned 11 12 and 5 ppcps were detected in water samples from water sources water purification plants and residential pipe networks of a city in the lower reaches of dongjiang river 63 therefore the removal of ppcps in drinking water is a research field that cannot be ignored which is consistent with the 30th ranking of drinking water in the keyword 3 3 1 2 main pollutants types keywords related to pollutant types were retrieved from 8355 articles in this study analysis of the top 100 keywords diclofenac ibuprofen acetaminophen naproxen and paracetamol are all drugs with analgesic and antipyretic functions as seen in table 2 the characteristics of top 20 common ppcps pollutants in table 2 are all from http www ichemistry cn these drugs are frequently used in human daily life and can flow into the environment through excrement discharge effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants and other channels causing serious consequences to the ecological environment animals plants and human beings diclofenac has been reported to cause renal failure in flying birds antibacterial drugs are also frequently detected such as sulfamethoxazole tetracycline amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin since the discovery of antibiotics in the 20th century they have been widely used in human medical treatment however the abuse of antibiotics is very common more and more antibiotics have been detected prolonged exposure to antibiotics can lead to adverse consequences in human body cause drug resistance and induce consistent resistance genes and resistant bacteria in the environment in addition personal care substances are also reflected in the top 100 keywords such as triclosan a disinfectant substance widely used in high efficiency medicinal soap sanitary soap sanitary lotion disinfectant hand sanitizer disinfectant for medical devices sanitary facial cleanser cream air freshener refrigerator deodorant the residue of triclosan in water will affect the normal function of blood cells of aquatic organisms and the activity of various enzymes in digestive gland 3 3 2 analysis of treatment technologies many methods are involved in the removal of ppcps pollutants six most common treatment processes are selected for the comparative analysis fig 5 shows the annual trend of the number of publications related to the six treatment processes from 1998 to 2019 as can be seen from the figure the number of publications related to membrane filtration showed a slow growth trend from 2003 to 2013 but it has been declining since 2013 the rebound in the number of publications related to nanofiltration in 2018 may be related to researchers starting to pay attention to the study of joint processes although ozone oxidation technology ranks second in the total number of publications the annual trend has changed since 2012 changing from a growth state to a stable state at the same time the number of publications related to photocatalytic oxidation technology has started to increase obviously which shows that researchers have transferred to photocatalytic oxidation technology focusing on the development of new advanced oxidation technology in recent years both biodegradation technology and adsorption technology have shown a stable growth trend in 22 years however it can be seen that adsorption technology obviously surpasses the other five technologies in both the total number of publications and the annual growth trend of publications and has become the main treatment technology in the field of ppcps removal at present in order to evaluate the research trends of various treatment processes more comprehensively patent analysis was carried out in this study 393 related patents were analyzed by searching and screening for the top 10 ppcps fig 6 is a patent analysis of five treatment processes it can be seen from the figure that the application of the adsorption process has an absolute advantage in both the literature analysis and the patent analysis and its development trend is consistent the third ranked ozone oxidation process in the literature analysis has only 13 related patents on the contrary there are 140 photocatalytic processes ranking 2nd the reason for this extreme contrast may be that the focus of the photocatalytic process is on the research and development of catalysts this kind of material research is more conducive to patent applications similarly the proportion of patents in biological treatment processes has also decreased compared to literature analysis there are only 4 patents related to nanofiltration which is consistent the decline of article trend however it is worth noting that in the patent analysis the application of joint process patents frequently appears such as the combination of adsorption and advanced oxidation the combination of biological treatment and photocatalysis the combination of biological treatment and adsorption this indicates that different processes can complement each other combined use helps to remove pollutants for better results and may become a trend in future research the following is a more detailed analysis of the four types of processing technology 3 3 2 1 biological treatment after one hundred years of development biological treatment has become one of the most widely used technologies that integrates various advantages of simple operation effective treatment of different ppcps pollutants low cost and strong adaptability of microorganisms 64 biological treatment is the mainstream process in sewage treatment plant thus biodegradation is an important way to remove ppcps the main mechanisms of biological treatment of ppcps include metabolism and co metabolism in metabolism the microbes use ppcps as the source of carbon or energy co metabolism is the transformation of ppcps by microbes in the presence of a growth substrate 65 66 achromobacter denitrificans pr1 could degrade sulfamethoxazole smx as the sole source of carbon nitrogen and energy 67 and stenotrophomonas species have also been found to degrade paracetamol 68 denitrifying activated sludge can more effectively biodegrade sulfamethoxazole erythromycin and atenolol in the presence of non restrictive organic substrates through co metabolism mechanism 69 however the presence of substrate may also have a certain inhibitory effect on biodegradation 70 the conventional biological treatment system aimed at removing cod has limited removal efficiency of ppcps but the excess sludge has the function of adsorbing and biotransformation of ppcps 71 thus keywords activated sludge and sludge were frequently appeared in the articles studied some studies have shown that when the sludge retention time srt in the biological treatment system is relatively long it has significant removal effect on some drugs and their derivatives membrane bioreactor is characterized by high sludge concentration and the srt can reach more than 30 days which is beneficial to the removal of ppcps however due to the existence of membrane pollution operation cost is relatively high in recent years many efforts have been devoted to the removal of ppcps wastewater using constructed wetlands 72 73 constructed wetlands have complex microbial species and a long running cycle which provides favorable conditions for the removal of ppcps in addition phytoremediation is also a vital part due to the fact that wetland plants absorb and accumulate pollutants through transpiration and then transfer them to other tissue parts for transformation 74 3 3 2 2 advanced oxidation process the concept of advanced oxidation process aops was put forward and widely used in the 1980s it is a new water treatment technology that can effectively remove refractory pollutants 75 the mechanism of degradation ppcps through aops is mainly to use strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals to oxidize and mineralize the target pollutants into carbon dioxide water and other small molecule compounds 76 78 at present commonly used advanced oxidation processes include ozone oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and fenton oxidation in the ozonation process ppcps can be removed by reacting directly with ozone or with hydroxyl radicals oh produced by ozonolysis 79 however the operation cost is high and the refractory pollutants cannot be completely mineralized in a short time and this may relate to the rankings of ozonation and ozone with a downward trend between 2003 and 2019 photocatalytic oxidation has developed rapidly from 2003 to 2019 due to its strong oxidizing ability and mild reaction conditions by 2019 it had already ranked 6th in keywords simple photochemistry cannot effectively and completely remove organic matters and a large number of intermediate products will be produced in the reaction process so it is necessary to add catalysts to improve the treatment effect commonly used catalysts are n type semiconductor catalysts such as titanium dioxide tungsten oxide iron oxide cadmium sulfide etc titanium dioxide has obtained the greatest interest in wastewater treatment 80 83 previous studies have proved that photocatalytic oxidation process with titanium dioxide catalyst and ultraviolet light can effectively degrade pollutants and produce fewer intermediate compounds without secondary pollution 84 the essence of fenton process is that fe2 catalyzes h2o2 to produce strong oxidizing oh under acidic conditions it is generally used for pretreatment of sewage containing ppcps 85 in addition in order to increase the rate of oh formation and increase the removal rate of ppcps the fenton method was improved and photo fenton emerged the results reported by shermer et al showed that the oxidation efficiency of photo fenton is 20 higher than fenton for amoxicillin removal 86 however the problem of high energy consumption and high cost is still the limitation of its development 3 3 2 3 membrane filtration technology membrane filtration technology is one of the common technologies in the field of water treatment and advanced purification size exclusion is the main mechanism of membrane filtration technology to remove pollutant molecules of different concentrations in solution the common membrane parameters need to be considered such as pore size molecular weight cut off and zeta potential 87 88 for ppcps pollutants membrane treatment has great advantages currently commonly used membrane filtration technologies include nanofiltration reverse osmosis ultrafiltration in the research of membrane removal of ppcps nanofiltration is most widely used followed by reverse osmosis from 2003 to 2017 the ranking of these three membrane technologies in keywords showed a significant downward trend due to the strict limitations of membrane separation technology although nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have good removal effect on ppcps high operating pressure leads to high energy consumption and low economical efficiency therefore combined application of membrane treatment technology and other advanced technologies such as adsorption photocatalysis electrocoagulation etc should be concerned to improve their feasibility in practical engineering applications 3 3 2 4 adsorption adsorption is a simple efficient and convenient pollutant treatment technology which has been widely used in various water treatment processes in recent years typical mechanism of adsorption to remove ppcps is mainly composed of physical adsorption caused by intermolecular forces 89 chemical adsorption caused by interaction with adsorbents such as acid base reaction chelation π complexation π π interaction electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding 90 91 from 2004 to 2009 the ranking of adsorption in keywords rapidly rose to 5th and then to 1 st in 2015 2019 the frequency of occurrence far exceeded other treatment methods and became the leading treatment method in the field of ppcps removal adsorbent is an important factor to determine the effectiveness of the adsorption process strong environmental adaptability and excellent desorption and regeneration performance are the keys to enable adsorbent competitive in this study keywords related to adsorbents were selected and summarized in table 3 through classification the research hot spots and trends of adsorbent were further analyzed as shown in table 3 the presence of key words such as activated carbon powdered activated carbon nanoparticles carbon nanotubes graphene oxide fully reflects the main position of carbon materials in adsorbent application in particular activated carbon has become the most widely used adsorption material due to its large specific surface area developed pore structure and stable chemical properties 92 93 and the application of activated carbon is relatively flexible and can be added to various processing units for example maillerteam used powdered activated carbon pac to remove pollutants in the fluidized bed 94 altmann et al directly added pac to the deep bed filter 95 the emergence of stable trend may be related to relatively high economic costs in engineering applications therefore the development and application of low cost high efficiency adsorbents have become an economical and effective method to remove ppcps 96 compared with common materials nano materials have larger specific surface area and more surface atoms thus showing stronger adsorption characteristics in table 2 keywords such as nanoparticles carbon nanotubes mesoporous silica nanotubes and zero valent iron are all related to nano adsorbents keywords such as nanosheets and zero valent iron have only appeared in the last 5 years and are ranked low which also indicates that some nanomaterials have much research space as new adsorbent materials clay mineral adsorbent has the characteristics of abundant reserves and low price 97 thus are promising in water pollution control the keywords montmorillonite bentonite zeolite and kaolinite in table 2 are all clay mineral adsorbents observing the ranking changes of such adsorbents in 22 years it was found that the ranking trends of the four adsorbents are changeable although clay adsorbents have been studied for several years and is not ranked high modifying and preparing composite adsorbents still have the potential to improve the adsorption performance due to the easily availability of raw materials and the low cost 98 99 biomass resources are abundant in the world some of them have rich functional groups contributing to good adsorption effect on pollutants most biomass possess the advantages of low price non toxicity and easy degradation therefore the development and utilization of biological adsorbents has become a new direction for the application of adsorbents the biosorbent mainly focuses on agricultural waste and residue polysaccharides and industrial waste biomaterials 100 the sawdust and rice husk in table 2 belong to the category of agricultural wastes in addition as a polymer with a wide range of sources and non toxicity chitosan has also received much attention in water treatment applications from 2010 to 2019 its ranking in keywords increased significantly from 117 to 83 at present many countries are committed to the development of biomass resources for the reutilization of biowastes indicating a broad prospect of bioadsorbents in future development since existing studies have shown that the effluent from wastewater treatment plants is the main source for ppcps in surface water environment reducing the concentration of ppcps in the effluent is one of the feasible ways to reduce the pollution of ppcps in the environment 101 the biological removal in the traditional process cannot guarantee the removal effect of ppcps 102 and some ppcps and their intermediate products may be resistant to biodegradation 103 advanced treatment processes such as adsorption and advanced oxidation can be added after traditional processes to improve treatment efficiency of persistent ppcps 104 for example using ozone as an advanced treatment system can increase the treatment rate of carbamazepine and diclofenac 105 the mechanism of microorganisms degrading multiple ppcps also deserves attention future research on hybrid systems should focus on exploring operating parameters under different operating conditions to improve the removal rate of multiple mixed pollutants in actual projects degradation of ppcps in soil and sediment environment will also be one of the focuses for future research 4 conclusions based on the data provided by the sci and scci databases the characteristics of the literature related to the removal of ppcps from 1998 to 2019 were summarized by bibliometric methods in the past 22 years the number of publications related to the removal of ppcps has increased significantly and become more globalized articles occupied the largest share of 92 16 8355 records and the vast majority of these documents were written in english the most productive countries were china 1726 articles followed by the united states 1295 articles spain 920 articles and germany 563 articles and these countries also performed best in the h index the journal with the highest output is water research which has a higher impact factor 7 913 and h index also ranked the first 110 through the keywords clustering analysis five clusters were identified which are polluted water types advanced oxidation adsorption biological treatment and membrane treatment technology among them adsorption is the most widely studied technology and carbon materials are the most commonly used adsorbents meanwhile there is much room for developing nano materials and biological materials in the future researchers can focus on the joint application of various processing technologies to achieve the economical and effective removal of ppcps developing new adsorbent materials with strong environmental adaptability and excellent desorption and regeneration performance is also competitive in addition the scientific trends obtained by bibliometric methods

13513,this study examined 9066 publications on the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps published between 1998 and 2019 through a bibliometric approach based on the scie and ssci databases the overall research distribution of ppcps characteristics of pollutants water pollution types and up to date treatment technologies were revealed the results showed that the number of articles relating to the removal of ppcps increased significantly with china contributing the most followed by the united states and spain water research is the most productive journal and the h index is the highest 110 five clusters were identified from the keyword network namely polluted water types biological treatment adsorption advanced oxidation and membrane treatment technology through the elaboration of clustering and its relationship it was found that research and development of technologies were the main concerns and the application of adsorption technology was the most extensive the most commonly used adsorbent is carbon material while nanomaterial and biomaterial adsorbent are promising these findings help to identify the global trend of ppcps removal and provide valuable references for further research in this area keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products bibliometric cluster analysis treatment technology adsorption 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps refer to the pollutions caused by daily products used for personal health and beauty care including antibiotics anti inflammatory drugs painkillers birth control pills weight reducing drugs perfumes disinfectants developing agent as well as other medicines and daily necessities 1 2 researchers have detected various ppcps in different environmental settings such as groundwater surface water drinking water sewage treatment plants sludge and sediments 3 this included 19 ppcps in a wastewater recycling facility georgia usa 4 11 ppcps in barnacle samples saudi red sea 5 and 9 ppcps in a drinking water treatment plant and a pilot plant ontario canada 6 in water environment the concentration of ppcps is relatively low generally in the range of ng l μg l it is less likely to cause an acute contamination events in a relatively short period of time most of the ppcps are transported to wastewater treatment plants after being excreted in the form of urine and feces 7 without specifical removal process a certain amount of ppcps will enter the surface water or groundwater environment with the effluent from the sewage plant 8 irrigation by surface water may lead to the uptake and bioaccumulation of ppcps in the edible parts of crops 9 in addition ppcps in surface water will also flow into the ocean during the runoff even in the antarctic and arctic regions 10 11 ppcps can also be detected due to the continuous accumulation in environment ppcps will cause potential harm to the ecological environment and public health because of strong biological activity bioaccumulation and difficult degradation 12 this phenomenon can also lead to the development of a large number of resistant bacteria and the occurrence of resistance genes in the aquatic environment 13 14 many studies have shown that long exposure of low concentrations of ppcps in the environment may hurt lower organisms such as algae and fish 15 16 this damage caused by ppcps may come from the inhibition of related enzyme activities in the organism and the impact on gene expression 17 19 diclofenac a commonly consumed anti inflammatory drug can cause oxidative damage to freshwater fish rhamdia quelen s organs by reducing the activity of superoxide dismutase and phase i biotransformation enzyme in the testis and liver of fish it is also detrimental to fish health by reducing the concentration of some neurotransmitters such as 3 4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid dopac and dopamine 20 moreover some ppcps are known to accumulate in and may be biomagnified through biological food consumption 21 in australia platypus consume half of the average human daily dose of antidepressants by eating aquatic invertebrate prey 22 diclofenac was the main cause of the population of asian gyps vultures declines vultures die from kidney failure caused by the accumulation of diclofenac which comes from the carcasses of livestock 23 some metabolites of ppcps remain the toxicity or are more toxic than the original ppcps for example the toxicity of the diclofenac photo transformation products is 5 6 times higher than that of its parent in algal reproduction tests 24 2 2 chlorophenyl amino benzaldehyde cpab as one photo transformation product of the pharmaceutical diclofenac has been identified to be more toxic to green algae scenedesmus vacuolatus due to its stronger hydrophobicity 25 different kinds of ppcps may generate various toxic effects on aquatic organisms the synergistic and antagonistic effects caused by the mixing of multiple ppcps may affect the degree of interference with nerves antioxidant defense metabolic and other system of the organism and even produce more complex toxic effects 26 27 exposure to diclofenac significantly increased the induction of acetylcholinesterase ache activity in carassius carassius while the mixture of diclofenac and carbamazepine significantly reduced the ache activity in carassius carassius causing potential neurotoxicity 28 ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin were selected to conduct toxicity experiments for freshwater algae chlorella vulgaris the toxic mixture effects of all tested chemicals were higher than the individual effect of each mixture component due to the strong synergism 29 the mixture of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole also showed higher toxicity toward the model organisms 30 considering the complexity of ppcps the existence of multiple ppcps will bring greater potential risk to aquatic organisms and ecosystems 31 32 ppcps removal technologies are developing with the detections of new emerging pollutants and the advancement of science and technology 33 a few studies have recently reported the current knowledge on toxicity of ppcps and the research progress of several certain technologies on ppcps removal such as algae based technologies 34 biosorption techniques with different biowaste compounds 35 and photodegradation 36 godoy and kummrow provided the ecotoxicology of ppcps mixtures including 194 assessments of the toxicity 37 the researchers summarized the mechanisms of pollutants removal and the fate of ppcps in algae based treatment systems which have potentials in ppcps removal 34 bioadsorbents derived from the bio wastes has enabled ppcps removal process to be economical and to achieve the reuse of solid wastes 35 visible light driven tio2 based heterojunctions and carbonaceous tio2 composites for ppcps degradation are both competitive in tio2 based photocatalysis processes schottky and z scheme heterojunctions are found to be effective due to their efficient separation of charge carriers and the occurrence of redox reactions at a relatively higher redox potential 38 the combination of carbonaceous materials e g activated carbon carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets with tio2 can significantly improve the performance of ppcps removal from aqueous solution 36 in fact besides above the information regarding ppcps types and treatment technologies are enormous especially currently more efforts have been devoted to the pollution control of ppcps all over the world therefore it is of great significance to analyze the characteristics of ppcps and the development trend of related removal technologies by the literature metrology bibliometrics is a measurement science in the process of information transmission which can be used to analyze and evaluate the influence and development trend of research objects 39 40 as far as we know there is no relative research on ppcps removal based on the bibliometrics analysis in the present study bibliometrics analysis will be used to explore the research hotspots and the objectives are to 1 discover the patterns and trends of ppcps removal through a comprehensive analysis of publication types languages countries regions institutions journals subject categories h index and other parameters according to the selected publications over the past 22 years 2 comprehensively analyze the co occurrence keywords network from the clusters of water types main ppcps types and mainstream treatment technologies the findings will provide valuable references for the way forward in scientific research 2 methodology 2 1 data sources the database selected for this study is the science citation index extension scie and the social science citation index ssci both of which are derived from the web of science core collection scie is an extended version of sci that contains more than 9000 journals and is the most commonly used data source for scientific research 41 the keywords selected in this study were pharmaceutical and removal personal care product and removal which were used to retrieve the titles keywords abstracts journals selected and other information in these two databases from 1998 to 2019 2 2 data analysis bibliometrics uses statistical methods to quantitatively analyze the literature information retrieved in this study the summary statistics of basic information article type language country keywords journals etc are used in microsoft excel 2013 in social network analysis the reading of data is done by bibexcel and a co word matrix is generated on this basis gephi software 0 9 2 is used to complete the network diagram of collaboration or co occurrence between different objects the graph consists of lines between nodes each node represents an individual and the line represents the relationship between different nodes the two most widely used evaluation indicators in this study were h index and impact factor if h index was proposed by physicist george hirsch in 2005 and can be used to evaluate academic output and academic achievements of researchers countries institutions journals etc if is the data in the journal citation report jcr produced by thomson reuters and is an important indicator of the quality and display of journals this study obtained the if 2019 from the isi website to analyze the quality of the journal 3 results and discussion 3 1 general statistics to investigate the publication characteristics and research trends of ppcps a total of 9066 articles published between 1998 and 2019 were evaluated of the 9066 publications retrieved from the databases articles took the biggest share with 92 16 8355 therefore only articles were further analyzed in this research articles related to ppcps removal in the databases were written in 11 different languages vast majority of these articles were written in english with 8277 records accounting for 99 07 the other languages accounted for a very low percentage indicating english is the main language in this field of ppcps in any country the number of publications increased steadily over the past 22 years and the articles increased to nearly 84 times in 2019 compared to 1998 as shown in fig 1 a total citation showed an increasing trend from 1998 to 2009 and reached the peak in 2009 with a record of 19318 after 2009 the trend changed and the number declined year by year the reason for this phenomenon is the time required for the accumulated effects of new publications a total of 8355 articles were published in 956 journals of these periodicals 837 87 55 published less than 10 articles the top 20 most productive journals published more than half of the total number of articles 50 86 table s1 summarizes the relevant information of the top 20 most productive journals tp if h index the number of publications on water research was the largest 554 6 63 followed by science of the total environment 482 5 77 chemosphere 471 5 64 chemical engineering journal 401 4 80 the impact factor if and h index are used to quantitatively measure the performance of various journals generally journals with high impact factors also have relatively high h index for example water research which has the highest output has the highest impact factor 9 130 and h index also ranks first 110 however there are anomalies desalination water science and technology have the similar h index 37 and 35 but the impact factors are very different which are 7 098 and 1 638 respectively this may be caused by the specialization selectivity and novelty of the journal ppcps pollutants are mainly diffused through water discharges most of the studies on ppcps also focuses on the treatment in the water environment but are relatively less involved in sediments and soils as a top journal in the field water research paid attention to the related research of ppcps earlier and accordingly becoming the most productive journal fig 1b shows the time trend of the top 7 most productive periodicals from 1998 to 2019 as can be seen from the figure the number of articles published in the seven periodicals shows an overall growth trend among them the number of publications of water research and journal of hazardous materials fluctuated after 2010 but remained stable at a certain number with the number rising after 2014 the growth trend of chemical engineering journal chemosphere and science and the total environment are very obvious 3 2 analysis of countries regions and cooperation countries regions performance can be determined by analyzing the address and affiliation of the author provided by each article 42 among these 8355 articles only 2348 articles 28 10 included international cooperation from 1998 to 2019 a total of 118 countries published academic research articles in scie and ssci databases which showed that nearly 60 of the countries in the world published research articles in this field however the articles published by the top 20 countries accounted for 82 2 of the total table s2 lists the characteristic indicators of articles published in the top 20 countries regions the country with the largest number of published articles is china 1726 articles accounting for 20 66 of all reports followed by the united states 1295 articles spain 920 articles and germany 563 articles in terms of h index the top three places are the united states spain and china indicating that they have relatively high level of influence in this field fig 2 a shows the time trend of publishing articles in the top 10 countries regions from 1998 to 2019 as can be seen from the figure there is a general trend of growth in the total number of articles published each year in all countries studies on ppcps in european and american countries started earlier american scholars daughton and ternes first formally proposed the concept of ppcps in 1999 43 before 2013 the number of articles published in the united states basically ranked first with the economic development and population growth china has gradually become the world s largest producer and user of ppcps 44 various antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes have been widely detected in the environment their toxic effects have been verified and the treatment has also been deeply concerned by scholars in china more than 50 000 tons of 36 major pollutants entered the environment in 2013 45 in 2015 the state council of china issued the water pollution prevention and control action plan which further urged the importance for the protection of china s aquatic ecosystems 46 the plan required the evaluation of new pollutants including ppcps under the guidance of the national policy in combination with the actual situation of the continuous increase in the total amount of ppcps the number of relevant articles has increased steadily at a rate of more than 20 per year since 2014 this is also consistent with the changes in the number of publications in some journals shown in fig 1b after 2013 china surpassed the united states to become the most productive country nowadays the number of articles output in china has far exceeded other countries it may be attributed to that chinese government and citizens devote effort to the removal of ppcps and it also shows that chinese scholars have deepened and extensive research in this field in addition spain s article output also has outstanding realization after 2008 ranking third as shown in fig 2b the top 30 most productive countries regions are mainly divided into two parts the green area is the asia america cooperation network centering on china and the united states china has cooperation with the united states singapore australia britain and other countries especially with the united states the red area is the european cooperation network centering on spain and germany it can be seen that exchanges and cooperation between countries regions with near geographical locations are closer according to 8355 articles providing the author s address information a total of 5305 institutions contributed to the subject of ppcps more than 60 of these articles were created by authors from different institutions fig 2c depicts the time trend of the top 7 most productive research institutions as can be seen from the figure before 2006 7 research institutions had little research on ppcps removal since then the number of publications of 7 research institutions has gradually and steadily increased the increase in the number of publications of the chinese academy of sciences and tsinghua university is especially obvious especially after 2014 the number of publications far exceeds that of other institutions between 2007 and 2012 the number of articles published by estremadura university increased rapidly reaching its peak 12 articles in 2012 after that the number began to decline year by year this is the only institution with a declining trend in the number of publications through the social network diagram this paper analyzes the cooperation relationship between the top 30 most productive institutions in the field of ppcps removal from 1998 to 2019 as shown in fig 2d research institutions in the same country cooperate most closely such as those in singapore spain china and denmark among them the spanish csic gerona university and idaea csic have very strong cooperative relations which are represented by thicker lines the chinese academy of sciences is especially active in this field it not only has close cooperation with domestic universities but also maintains cooperative and exchange relations with institutions in singapore japan australia and canada it is the network center of blue region 3 3 analysis of keywords the keywords reflect the most important content in an article sorting out and analyzing the author keywords can effectively capture the hot spots of scientific research and help to understand and grasp the development trend in this field analyzing the changes of keywords in different periods is a common bibliometric method of the 8355 articles related to the removal of ppcps 1018 articles did not provide the author keywords so the 14 095 keywords provided by 7337 publications were finally analyzed among them a total of 10 660 75 63 keywords appeared only once 1500 10 64 keywords were used twice 583 4 14 keywords were used three times the high percentage of one time keywords showed the discontinuity and the universality of research focus in this field there were 461 3 27 keywords that appeared 10 times or more these high frequency keywords can better reflect the mainstream of research in the field of ppcps removal table 1 lists the changes of the top 30 keywords in the four phases 1998 2004 2004 2009 2010 2014 2015 2019 pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical and removal are the words used in this study to retrieve articles in the database so they can be ignored as can be seen from table 1 key words in the top 7 are adsorption 680 9 27 wastewater 459 6 26 wastewater treatment 332 4 53 biodegradation 299 4 08 antibiotics 267 3 64 photocatalysis 241 3 28 and ozonation 220 3 00 this indicated that adsorption biological treatment photocatalysis and advanced oxidation are the mainstream treatment technologies in the field of ppcps removal among them adsorption rose from 22nd in 1998 to 2nd in 2019 which shows that adsorption is deeply concerned as an effective treatment technology for drugs and personal care products in water the ranking of biodegradation rose from 15th in 2004 2009 to 5th in 2015 2019 indicating the economical and extensive application of biological treatment technologies however the ranking of ozonation showed a slow downward trend falling from the 5th in 2004 2009 to the 15th in 2015 2019 while photocatalysis an advanced oxidation rose from the 27th in 2004 2009 to the 6th in 2015 2019 which may be caused by the diversity of advanced oxidation technologies in addition there is also a significant decline in the ranking of processing technologies with nanofiltration falling from 4th in 2004 2009 to 30th in 2015 2019 although the membrane treatment technology has high efficiency the relatively low economic benefits make it limited in researches among the keywords antibiotics ranked 5th has been stable from 1998 to 2019 which shows that the universality of antibiotics have always been a hot research topic in the field of ppcps removal detailed to the specific drugs such as diclofenac carbamazepine and ibuprofen are ranked 8th 14th and 17th among the keywords respectively kinetics has also received more attention rising from 16th in 2004 2009 to 9th in 2015 2019 indicating that analyzing the removal mechanism of ppcps pollution is also one of the concerns with the progress of science and technology and the improvement of detection technology many low content substances that were previously undetectable in water began to be discovered slowly therefore the rankings of micropollutants and emerging contaminants increased significantly year by year from 20th and 35th in 2004 2009 to 11th and 10th in 2015 2019 respectively it is known that drug abuse and prolonged exposure to antibiotics can lead to endocrine disorders in human bodies in severe cases it can cause drug resistance lack of medication and even serious consequences of teratogenic carcinogenic and mutagenic effects 47 49 therefore there are more articles concerning toxicity and the ranking has also risen from 35th to 10th bibexcel software was used to generate a common word matrix and the top 100 high frequency author keywords were selected to carry out clustering analysis based on gephi 0 9 2 software the co occurrence keywords network revealed the focuses of the researches which can be found in detail in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 five words clusters were found from the co occurrence keywords network polluted water types advanced oxidation adsorption biological treatment and membrane treatment technology according to the classification the detailed discussion will follow two main parts of pollution types and analysis of treatment technologies 3 3 1 pollution types 3 3 1 1 polluted water types the keywords refer to a variety of water types associated with ppcps such as wastewater drinking water surface water municipal wastewater hospital wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater in a populated city pollutants from shampoo hair dye and oral cleaning products all used in daily life are collected into municipal wastewater which is an important source of pollutants for personal care products hospitals and pharmaceutical factories produce the most pollutants related to drugs in the process of using and producing drugs fig 4 shows the concentration of some typical ppcps in different polluted water types including hospital wastewater 50 municipal wastewater 51 industrial wastewater 52 surface water 53 and groundwater 54 studies have shown that the removal of some antibiotics by the existing sewage treatment process is not obvious 55 59 the treated wastewater still contains residual antibiotics and eventually flows into surface water which becomes a major threat to the recycling of water resources 52 60 wang et al 61 detected 28 ppcps from urban river water samples collected from beijing changzhou and shenzhen various ppcps contaminants were found in both dendritic and cyclical water networks 62 with the increased safety requirements for drinking water the trace pollutants detected should also be concerned 11 12 and 5 ppcps were detected in water samples from water sources water purification plants and residential pipe networks of a city in the lower reaches of dongjiang river 63 therefore the removal of ppcps in drinking water is a research field that cannot be ignored which is consistent with the 30th ranking of drinking water in the keyword 3 3 1 2 main pollutants types keywords related to pollutant types were retrieved from 8355 articles in this study analysis of the top 100 keywords diclofenac ibuprofen acetaminophen naproxen and paracetamol are all drugs with analgesic and antipyretic functions as seen in table 2 the characteristics of top 20 common ppcps pollutants in table 2 are all from http www ichemistry cn these drugs are frequently used in human daily life and can flow into the environment through excrement discharge effluent discharge from sewage treatment plants and other channels causing serious consequences to the ecological environment animals plants and human beings diclofenac has been reported to cause renal failure in flying birds antibacterial drugs are also frequently detected such as sulfamethoxazole tetracycline amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin since the discovery of antibiotics in the 20th century they have been widely used in human medical treatment however the abuse of antibiotics is very common more and more antibiotics have been detected prolonged exposure to antibiotics can lead to adverse consequences in human body cause drug resistance and induce consistent resistance genes and resistant bacteria in the environment in addition personal care substances are also reflected in the top 100 keywords such as triclosan a disinfectant substance widely used in high efficiency medicinal soap sanitary soap sanitary lotion disinfectant hand sanitizer disinfectant for medical devices sanitary facial cleanser cream air freshener refrigerator deodorant the residue of triclosan in water will affect the normal function of blood cells of aquatic organisms and the activity of various enzymes in digestive gland 3 3 2 analysis of treatment technologies many methods are involved in the removal of ppcps pollutants six most common treatment processes are selected for the comparative analysis fig 5 shows the annual trend of the number of publications related to the six treatment processes from 1998 to 2019 as can be seen from the figure the number of publications related to membrane filtration showed a slow growth trend from 2003 to 2013 but it has been declining since 2013 the rebound in the number of publications related to nanofiltration in 2018 may be related to researchers starting to pay attention to the study of joint processes although ozone oxidation technology ranks second in the total number of publications the annual trend has changed since 2012 changing from a growth state to a stable state at the same time the number of publications related to photocatalytic oxidation technology has started to increase obviously which shows that researchers have transferred to photocatalytic oxidation technology focusing on the development of new advanced oxidation technology in recent years both biodegradation technology and adsorption technology have shown a stable growth trend in 22 years however it can be seen that adsorption technology obviously surpasses the other five technologies in both the total number of publications and the annual growth trend of publications and has become the main treatment technology in the field of ppcps removal at present in order to evaluate the research trends of various treatment processes more comprehensively patent analysis was carried out in this study 393 related patents were analyzed by searching and screening for the top 10 ppcps fig 6 is a patent analysis of five treatment processes it can be seen from the figure that the application of the adsorption process has an absolute advantage in both the literature analysis and the patent analysis and its development trend is consistent the third ranked ozone oxidation process in the literature analysis has only 13 related patents on the contrary there are 140 photocatalytic processes ranking 2nd the reason for this extreme contrast may be that the focus of the photocatalytic process is on the research and development of catalysts this kind of material research is more conducive to patent applications similarly the proportion of patents in biological treatment processes has also decreased compared to literature analysis there are only 4 patents related to nanofiltration which is consistent the decline of article trend however it is worth noting that in the patent analysis the application of joint process patents frequently appears such as the combination of adsorption and advanced oxidation the combination of biological treatment and photocatalysis the combination of biological treatment and adsorption this indicates that different processes can complement each other combined use helps to remove pollutants for better results and may become a trend in future research the following is a more detailed analysis of the four types of processing technology 3 3 2 1 biological treatment after one hundred years of development biological treatment has become one of the most widely used technologies that integrates various advantages of simple operation effective treatment of different ppcps pollutants low cost and strong adaptability of microorganisms 64 biological treatment is the mainstream process in sewage treatment plant thus biodegradation is an important way to remove ppcps the main mechanisms of biological treatment of ppcps include metabolism and co metabolism in metabolism the microbes use ppcps as the source of carbon or energy co metabolism is the transformation of ppcps by microbes in the presence of a growth substrate 65 66 achromobacter denitrificans pr1 could degrade sulfamethoxazole smx as the sole source of carbon nitrogen and energy 67 and stenotrophomonas species have also been found to degrade paracetamol 68 denitrifying activated sludge can more effectively biodegrade sulfamethoxazole erythromycin and atenolol in the presence of non restrictive organic substrates through co metabolism mechanism 69 however the presence of substrate may also have a certain inhibitory effect on biodegradation 70 the conventional biological treatment system aimed at removing cod has limited removal efficiency of ppcps but the excess sludge has the function of adsorbing and biotransformation of ppcps 71 thus keywords activated sludge and sludge were frequently appeared in the articles studied some studies have shown that when the sludge retention time srt in the biological treatment system is relatively long it has significant removal effect on some drugs and their derivatives membrane bioreactor is characterized by high sludge concentration and the srt can reach more than 30 days which is beneficial to the removal of ppcps however due to the existence of membrane pollution operation cost is relatively high in recent years many efforts have been devoted to the removal of ppcps wastewater using constructed wetlands 72 73 constructed wetlands have complex microbial species and a long running cycle which provides favorable conditions for the removal of ppcps in addition phytoremediation is also a vital part due to the fact that wetland plants absorb and accumulate pollutants through transpiration and then transfer them to other tissue parts for transformation 74 3 3 2 2 advanced oxidation process the concept of advanced oxidation process aops was put forward and widely used in the 1980s it is a new water treatment technology that can effectively remove refractory pollutants 75 the mechanism of degradation ppcps through aops is mainly to use strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals to oxidize and mineralize the target pollutants into carbon dioxide water and other small molecule compounds 76 78 at present commonly used advanced oxidation processes include ozone oxidation photocatalytic oxidation and fenton oxidation in the ozonation process ppcps can be removed by reacting directly with ozone or with hydroxyl radicals oh produced by ozonolysis 79 however the operation cost is high and the refractory pollutants cannot be completely mineralized in a short time and this may relate to the rankings of ozonation and ozone with a downward trend between 2003 and 2019 photocatalytic oxidation has developed rapidly from 2003 to 2019 due to its strong oxidizing ability and mild reaction conditions by 2019 it had already ranked 6th in keywords simple photochemistry cannot effectively and completely remove organic matters and a large number of intermediate products will be produced in the reaction process so it is necessary to add catalysts to improve the treatment effect commonly used catalysts are n type semiconductor catalysts such as titanium dioxide tungsten oxide iron oxide cadmium sulfide etc titanium dioxide has obtained the greatest interest in wastewater treatment 80 83 previous studies have proved that photocatalytic oxidation process with titanium dioxide catalyst and ultraviolet light can effectively degrade pollutants and produce fewer intermediate compounds without secondary pollution 84 the essence of fenton process is that fe2 catalyzes h2o2 to produce strong oxidizing oh under acidic conditions it is generally used for pretreatment of sewage containing ppcps 85 in addition in order to increase the rate of oh formation and increase the removal rate of ppcps the fenton method was improved and photo fenton emerged the results reported by shermer et al showed that the oxidation efficiency of photo fenton is 20 higher than fenton for amoxicillin removal 86 however the problem of high energy consumption and high cost is still the limitation of its development 3 3 2 3 membrane filtration technology membrane filtration technology is one of the common technologies in the field of water treatment and advanced purification size exclusion is the main mechanism of membrane filtration technology to remove pollutant molecules of different concentrations in solution the common membrane parameters need to be considered such as pore size molecular weight cut off and zeta potential 87 88 for ppcps pollutants membrane treatment has great advantages currently commonly used membrane filtration technologies include nanofiltration reverse osmosis ultrafiltration in the research of membrane removal of ppcps nanofiltration is most widely used followed by reverse osmosis from 2003 to 2017 the ranking of these three membrane technologies in keywords showed a significant downward trend due to the strict limitations of membrane separation technology although nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have good removal effect on ppcps high operating pressure leads to high energy consumption and low economical efficiency therefore combined application of membrane treatment technology and other advanced technologies such as adsorption photocatalysis electrocoagulation etc should be concerned to improve their feasibility in practical engineering applications 3 3 2 4 adsorption adsorption is a simple efficient and convenient pollutant treatment technology which has been widely used in various water treatment processes in recent years typical mechanism of adsorption to remove ppcps is mainly composed of physical adsorption caused by intermolecular forces 89 chemical adsorption caused by interaction with adsorbents such as acid base reaction chelation π complexation π π interaction electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding 90 91 from 2004 to 2009 the ranking of adsorption in keywords rapidly rose to 5th and then to 1 st in 2015 2019 the frequency of occurrence far exceeded other treatment methods and became the leading treatment method in the field of ppcps removal adsorbent is an important factor to determine the effectiveness of the adsorption process strong environmental adaptability and excellent desorption and regeneration performance are the keys to enable adsorbent competitive in this study keywords related to adsorbents were selected and summarized in table 3 through classification the research hot spots and trends of adsorbent were further analyzed as shown in table 3 the presence of key words such as activated carbon powdered activated carbon nanoparticles carbon nanotubes graphene oxide fully reflects the main position of carbon materials in adsorbent application in particular activated carbon has become the most widely used adsorption material due to its large specific surface area developed pore structure and stable chemical properties 92 93 and the application of activated carbon is relatively flexible and can be added to various processing units for example maillerteam used powdered activated carbon pac to remove pollutants in the fluidized bed 94 altmann et al directly added pac to the deep bed filter 95 the emergence of stable trend may be related to relatively high economic costs in engineering applications therefore the development and application of low cost high efficiency adsorbents have become an economical and effective method to remove ppcps 96 compared with common materials nano materials have larger specific surface area and more surface atoms thus showing stronger adsorption characteristics in table 2 keywords such as nanoparticles carbon nanotubes mesoporous silica nanotubes and zero valent iron are all related to nano adsorbents keywords such as nanosheets and zero valent iron have only appeared in the last 5 years and are ranked low which also indicates that some nanomaterials have much research space as new adsorbent materials clay mineral adsorbent has the characteristics of abundant reserves and low price 97 thus are promising in water pollution control the keywords montmorillonite bentonite zeolite and kaolinite in table 2 are all clay mineral adsorbents observing the ranking changes of such adsorbents in 22 years it was found that the ranking trends of the four adsorbents are changeable although clay adsorbents have been studied for several years and is not ranked high modifying and preparing composite adsorbents still have the potential to improve the adsorption performance due to the easily availability of raw materials and the low cost 98 99 biomass resources are abundant in the world some of them have rich functional groups contributing to good adsorption effect on pollutants most biomass possess the advantages of low price non toxicity and easy degradation therefore the development and utilization of biological adsorbents has become a new direction for the application of adsorbents the biosorbent mainly focuses on agricultural waste and residue polysaccharides and industrial waste biomaterials 100 the sawdust and rice husk in table 2 belong to the category of agricultural wastes in addition as a polymer with a wide range of sources and non toxicity chitosan has also received much attention in water treatment applications from 2010 to 2019 its ranking in keywords increased significantly from 117 to 83 at present many countries are committed to the development of biomass resources for the reutilization of biowastes indicating a broad prospect of bioadsorbents in future development since existing studies have shown that the effluent from wastewater treatment plants is the main source for ppcps in surface water environment reducing the concentration of ppcps in the effluent is one of the feasible ways to reduce the pollution of ppcps in the environment 101 the biological removal in the traditional process cannot guarantee the removal effect of ppcps 102 and some ppcps and their intermediate products may be resistant to biodegradation 103 advanced treatment processes such as adsorption and advanced oxidation can be added after traditional processes to improve treatment efficiency of persistent ppcps 104 for example using ozone as an advanced treatment system can increase the treatment rate of carbamazepine and diclofenac 105 the mechanism of microorganisms degrading multiple ppcps also deserves attention future research on hybrid systems should focus on exploring operating parameters under different operating conditions to improve the removal rate of multiple mixed pollutants in actual projects degradation of ppcps in soil and sediment environment will also be one of the focuses for future research 4 conclusions based on the data provided by the sci and scci databases the characteristics of the literature related to the removal of ppcps from 1998 to 2019 were summarized by bibliometric methods in the past 22 years the number of publications related to the removal of ppcps has increased significantly and become more globalized articles occupied the largest share of 92 16 8355 records and the vast majority of these documents were written in english the most productive countries were china 1726 articles followed by the united states 1295 articles spain 920 articles and germany 563 articles and these countries also performed best in the h index the journal with the highest output is water research which has a higher impact factor 7 913 and h index also ranked the first 110 through the keywords clustering analysis five clusters were identified which are polluted water types advanced oxidation adsorption biological treatment and membrane treatment technology among them adsorption is the most widely studied technology and carbon materials are the most commonly used adsorbents meanwhile there is much room for developing nano materials and biological materials in the future researchers can focus on the joint application of various processing technologies to achieve the economical and effective removal of ppcps developing new adsorbent materials with strong environmental adaptability and excellent desorption and regeneration performance is also competitive in addition the scientific trends obtained by bibliometric methods

13514,the removal of different natural organic matter nom components from boreal lake water was studied at ambient temperature 0 4 18 5 c in a full scale drinking water treatment plant dwtp the specific aim was to compare the performance of granular activated carbon gac filters containing different commercial carbons liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd fluorescence excitation and emission matrices feem and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc analyses showed that surface water nom was dominated by humic substances hs had the highest fluorescence intensity at the region associated with fulvic acid like nom and contained on average 0 2 mg l of bdoc coagulation flocculation and flotation removed 61 82 of hs and biopolymers and on average 50 of the bdoc chlorine dioxide oxidation increased the proportion of hs with 18 22 and the concentration of bdoc with on average 0 05 mg l while it decreased the proportion of low molecular weight neutrals lmwn sand and gac filtration removed bdoc to a level below 0 15 mg l the two studied gacs showed a 25 difference in their cumulative total organic carbon toc removals the distributions of nom fractions were similar in the effluents of both filters with lmwn being the most efficiently removed fraction nom removal was due to adsorption rather than biodegradation in the filters in conclusion dwtps benefit from complementary analyses such as lc ocd feem and bdoc for understanding and optimising nom removal comparison of different gacs in full scale studies is also important due to differences in the toc removals of gacs with similar product specifications keywords granular activated carbon filtration nom characterisation adsorption biodegradation 1 introduction many drinking water treatment plants dwtps need to improve their treatment processes to provide high quality potable water from surface waters that are currently experiencing continuously increasing levels and variable quality of natural organic matter nom 1 the nom origin and its characteristics such as its molecular size distribution biodegradable fraction and fluorophore composition are catchment area specific and may vary seasonally 2 4 in addition further changes in both quantity and quality of nom are expected due to the impacts of climate change on local hydrology 1 if not sufficiently removed by the dwtps nom can contribute to an unpleasant colour taste and odour of drinking water as well as to the formation of carcinogenic disinfection by products and bacterial regrowth in the distribution networks 5 typically dwtps apply a combination of several unit processes such as coagulation flocculation clarification oxidation and filtration to achieve their nom removal targets coagulation flocculation followed by clarification removes mainly hydrophobic high molecular weight nom compounds 6 after floc removal in the clarification stage oxidation with ozone is commonly applied as a disinfectant and to alter the structure of organic compounds thereby improving the removal of nom in subsequent processes 7 thereafter granular activated carbon gac filtration is used to finalise the removal of partially oxidised nom by adsorption and or biodegradation 5 8 depending on the properties of gac the operational regimes and the quality of the influent water studies in dwtps with gac filtration and ozonation have shown that the adsorption of nom fractions increases with decreasing molecular size 9 and that both the low and intermediate molecular weight fractions of nom are efficiently adsorbed 10 some dwtps use clo2 rather than ozone for oxidation 11 13 for example tampere water finland has used clo2 oxidation followed by sand and gac filtration for over 20 years in a dwtp to produce drinking water from boreal lake water the reasons for selecting clo2 oxidation over ozonation include a less complex technology and lower maintenance requirements and investment costs as well as the low formation of bromate and bromoform 14 16 the downside of choosing clo2 is that ozone reportedly changes the molecular weight distribution of nom and increases its biodegradability more efficiently than is achieved with clo2 as shown in laboratory batch studies 17 18 previous studies have illustrated the formation and fate of disinfection by products and the removal of different molecular weight fractions of nom in dwtps that use clo2 oxidation 12 19 however to our knowledge the impacts of clo2 oxidation on nom characteristics have not been investigated in detail in full scale dwtps using advanced and multiple complementary nom characterisation tools such as liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd fluorescence excitation and emission matrices feem and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc analyses detailed nom characterisation both in terms of its physico chemical properties and biodegradability is required in order to understand the composition changes of nom in the treatment train and to improve the operation of dwtps the potential of gac filters to remove nom is affected by the characteristics of the specific gac used and by the characteristics of the nom in the influent 5 8 as well as by the process conditions such as the temperature 20 the various available gacs differ in their raw material makeup and in their physico chemical characteristics such as pore size distribution surface chemistry and surface area 21 22 these differences impact their sorption capacity measured as the iodine number as well as their ability to maintain the active microbial biomass measured as adenosine triphosphate atp required to biodegrade nom recent laboratory studies in carefully controlled conditions have provided important basic information on the mechanisms of adsorption and biodegradation in gac filters 22 23 but full scale studies are necessary to understand the removal of nom at dwtps where changes in temperature influent water quality and process variables such as backwashing influence the performance of gac filtration 10 thus the determination of the feasibility of different gacs for efficient nom removal would benefit from a systematic comparative full scale study using advanced complementary analyses of both gac and water quality under ambient conditions dwtps that use alternative oxidants such as clo2 are missing this type of information needed for the optimisation of nom removal the aim of the present study was to evaluate the removal of nom components at ambient temperatures 0 4 18 5 c in the sequential unit processes of a full scale dwtp that uses boreal humic lake water as a water source and applies clo2 for oxidation lc ocd feem and bdoc analyses were applied to characterise nom in terms of its molecular size fractions fluorophore composition and biodegradability respectively in particular the goal was to compare the nom removal and its mechanisms between two activated carbons used in gac filters 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water treatment plant the study was conducted at a dwtp tampere water finland which in 2018 produced about 70 annually ca 13 million m3 of the drinking water for the over 200 000 inhabitants in the city of tampere and surrounding communities raw water for the plant is taken from lake roine surface area 55 km2 at a depth of 4 5 m which is 2 m above the bottom of the lake the treatment train includes coagulation ferric sulphate and flocculation followed by flotation cff chlorine dioxide clo2 oxidation 0 2 g m3 sand filtration gac filtration post chlorination and ultraviolet uv disinfection fig 1 the gac filtration stage consists of several parallel down flow filters all activated carbons in the filter beds are either regenerated or replaced with virgin gac once a year to achieve the target concentration of total organic carbon toc 2 5 mg l in drinking water 2 2 setup and properties of the gac filters two down flow gac filters referred to henceforth as filters a and b were filled with different commercial activated carbons gac a or b the filters were followed for eight months from the startup of the filters august 2017 until april 2018 the properties of the gacs are given in table 1 the virgin carbons 1 5 m layer 45 m3 were added to the basins gac a 2nd august referred to as day 0 of the study and gac b 10th august after which the carbons were rinsed with water 120 m3 for 10 min every 2 h over 24 h a total of 12 rinse cycles and the rinse water was discharged into the sewage system after the initial rinse the flow rate in the filters was gradually increased from 60 m3 h to the normal operational flow rate within three days during operation the empty bed contact time ebct was approximately 14 min at a flow rate of 200 m3 h the actual flow rate was measured and used in the planning of backwashing the gac filters were regularly backwashed with chlorinated product water to release bound organic and inorganic substances and to avoid filter clogging 24 the backwashing was typically performed every 3 7 days based on the head loss the backwashing procedure included an upflow rinse with water 1 min 20 s an air scour 1 min 15 s a final upflow rinse with water 10 min and a downflow prefiltration 8 min during which the water was discharged into the sewage system 2 3 sampling the toc concentration at different stages of the treatment train raw water flotation clo2 oxidation and sand filtration was followed regularly as a part of the monitoring programme of the dwtp the raw water temperature was taken as the daily average of online measurements the performance of the studied gac filters was monitored through grab samples of influent and effluent from both filters taken every 1 4 weeks and analysed for turbidity ph toc and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 the nom characterisation lc ocd feem and bdoc of water from different stages of the treatment process raw water after flotation after clo2 oxidation after sand filtration effluent of gac filter a and effluent of gac filter b fig 1 was performed three times based on the observed change in toc removals 1 from 19 to 35 day 60 of operation of filter a 2 from 12 to 19 day 109 and 3 from 7 to 15 day 166 or day 235 in the case of bdoc analysis the samplings for nom characterisation were timed at 2 9 h after backwashing of the filters water samples for toc uv254 and nom characterisations were collected in glass bottles previously acid washed or heated at 450 c for 2 h except for new borosilicate glass bottles for lc ocd analysis which were soaked in ultrapure deionised water for three days and rinsed with ultrapure water the concentration of active bacterial biomass on the gac was determined three times at days 61 110 and 200 of the operation of filter a and the iodine number of gac samples was determined four times after the initial 24 h rinse and on days 61 110 and 166 of the operation of filter a the surface morphology of the carbons was analysed using scanning electron microscopy sem after the initial 24 h rinse and on day 166 the sampling times were chosen so that they represent different toc removal phases as explained above the gac samples were collected with a core sampler at 0 1 m below the surface of the filter beds 2 4 analytical methods and calculations water samples were analysed for turbidity and ph according to standard methods sfs en iso 7027 1 2016 sfs 3021 1979 uv254 representing aromatic nom and toc were measured as sum parameters of nom with shimadzu uv 1800 and shimadzu toc vcph instruments sfs en 1484 1997 respectively total toc removals g toc kg of added gac at the end of the study were calculated as follows 1 m g a c i 1 n v δ t i 0 5 c i n f i 1 c i n f i 0 5 c e f f i 1 c e f f i where m g a c the

triplicate by incubating sterile filtered water samples 200 ml with an indigenous bacterial inoculum 2 ml of raw water for four weeks at 20 c according to the method of servais et al 25 but with the following three modifications 1 all glassware used in the analysis was heated at 450 c for 2 h to remove trace organics 2 the 0 2 μm membrane filters used for the sterilisation of samples were first rinsed with 300 ml of 60 c ultrapure water and then with 300 ml of the water sample to avoid the release of organic matter 3 toc in the duplicate samples taken at the beginning and end of the 4 week incubation were analysed immediately after sampling with the shimadzu toc vcph statistically significant differences were determined using two tailed t tests p values less than 0 05 were considered significant liquid size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd was conducted to distinguish ﬁve molecular size fractions of dissolved organic carbon doc biopolymers bp 20 000 g

fluorescence excitation and emission matrices feem were recorded with fluorolog 3 horiba scientific inc using a 1 cm cuvette and the following wavelengths excitation 235 515 nm 10 nm increments and emission 230 nm 645 nm 5 nm increments prior to the measurements nonfiltered water samples and deionised water milliq were tempered at 20 c in an incubator measured deionised water feems and information from the instrument were used for corrections of sample specific feems humic acid like fulvo acid like and protein like fluorescence peak intensities as well as the humification index 27 and fluorescence index 28 were calculated using equations shown in the references except that the nearest wavelength was used in cases where the specified wavelength had not been measured further details of the feem measurements and calculations are given in text s1 atp concentrations in gac samples were analysed according to velten et al 29 to quantify the concentration of active bacterial biomass duplicate gac samples were pretreated by rinsing them in sterile phosphate buffer atp concentrations were measured in three subsamples of each pre treated gac iodine numbers which serve as relative indicators of the sorption capacity of gac were determined on carbon samples based on three point adsorption isotherms r2 0 959 0 999 according to a standard protocol sfs en 12902 2005 sem zeiss ultra plus was employed to study the surface morphology of gac samples the samples were dried at 105 c before the analysis and sputter coated with carbon 3 results and discussion 3 1 routine dwtp monitoring 3 1 1 raw water quality and toc and uv254 removal in the unit processes preceding gac filtration the toc concentration of raw water was 6 1 0 2 mg l during the eight month study table 2 while the water temperature varied considerably the raw water temperature decreased gradually from 18 3 c to below 1 c in 4 5 months and stayed below 1 5 c during the last 3 5 months fig 2 a the water temperature in the treatment process was close 1 c difference to that of raw water the raw water toc has increased by approximately 0 5 mg l over the last two decades as indicated by comparison of the present results with those of matilainen et al 30 this increase is in line with the generally increasing trend in surface water toc concentrations in nordic countries 1 the treatment stages prior to gac filtration removed on average 56 of toc and 74 of uv254 table 2 from the raw water during the eight month study the toc concentration decreased constantly from 6 1 0 2 mg l in the raw water to 2 6 0 1 mg l in the influent of gac filters table 2 despite the decrease in water temperature cff removed on average 53 of the raw water toc thus cff with ferric sulphate coagulant can remove toc consistently independent of the raw water temperature thereby confirming the suitability of ferric salt coagulants regardless of the temperature 31 clo2 oxidation had no impact on the toc concentration or on uv254 indicating that nom was not mineralised and the aromatic character of nom did not change sand filtration removed only 6 of the remaining toc but 56 of uv254 likely due to the removal of the strongly uv254 absorbing residual flocs 3 1 2 gac filter performance toc turbidity and uv254 removal the performance of the two gac filters a and b containing commercial activated carbons was monitored for the removal of toc and uv254 beginning from the filling of the filters and for the next eight months at that time the toc removal fig 2d had stabilised to approximately 7 filter a and 15 filter b during the study the ph filter a ph 7 6 8 7 and filter b ph 7 6 8 5 and the turbidity of the gac filter effluents followed mostly the gac influent ph ph 7 4 8 6 and turbidity fig 2b due to the preceding treatment stages the influent water turbidity was generally low on average 0 07 ntu fig 2b but the gac filters reduced turbidity during occasional events of elevated influent turbidity for example on days 166 and 179 fig 2b in both filters the removal of toc and uv254 followed a similar declining trend over time but consistently more toc and uv254 absorbing compounds were removed by filter b than by filter a fig 2c g both filters removed 80 of the toc and 88 97 of uv254 in the influent water during the first days after the startup fig 2d and f thereby lowering the toc concentration to about 0 5 mg l fig 2c the toc removal decreased during the first three months so toc removal was 15 in filter a and 22 in filter b after 102 days from day 109 onwards until the end of the study 256 days the toc removals were on average 9 range 0 15 in filter a and 15 range 9 22 in filter b while the uv254 removals were on average 19 range 15 24 and 26 range 18 31 respectively after 109 days the average effluent toc concentrations were 2 4 0 1 and 2 2 0 1 mg l in filters a and b in total filter a removed approximately 610 kg of toc whereas filter b removed 840 kg of toc during the 8 month operation fig 2g mass balances are a useful tool for estimating the toc removal over time as shown in a pilot scale study that compared the doc uptake of two gac adsorbers that differed in their particle size influent water quality and backwashing regime 9 however mass balances are rarely used in full scale dwtp studies or to compare carbons with similar physical properties in the present study the toc removal per kg of gac differed by 25 41 g toc kg of added gac in filter b vs 33 g of toc kg of added gac in filter a fig 2g despite the similar physical properties reported by the manufacturers table 1 the sem micrographs also highlighted the similarity of the carbons fig s1 both gacs had heterogeneous irregular surface typical of coal based gacs and the surface morphology of the carbons did not differ notably at the beginning of the study or on day 166 due to the same raw material and particle size physical properties are generally used for gac selection at dwtps the results of the present study suggest that dwtps benefit from full scale comparisons of toc removal per kg of gac as a basis for the selection of gac 3 2 removal of nom components 3 2 1 raw water characteristics and removal in the treatment stages preceding gac filtration nom in the raw water and after each treatment stage was characterised in terms of molecular size distribution functional group composition and biodegradability using lc ocd feem and bdoc characterisation was conducted in three different toc removal stages of the gac filters 1 19 35 removal day 60 of operation of filter a 2 12 19 removal day 109 and 3 7 15 removal day 166 or day 235 these dates also corresponded to the different raw water temperatures 11 8 3 4 and 0 4 or 0 6 c respectively the two first analytical methods are complementary the feem based approach was used to determine the removal of fluorescent fulvic acid like humic acid like and protein like components of both particulate and dissolved organic carbon fig 4 whereas lc ocd separated both fluorescent and non fluorescent doc into five major components bp hs bb lmwn and lmwa based on their molecular size fig 3 fluorescence and humification indices were used to evaluate the origin of nom terrestrial versus microbial and the degree of humification respectively bdoc describes the biodegradable part of dissolved organic carbon and it was determined as a way to evaluate the impact of different treatment stages on the bacterial growth promoting properties of water fig 3j in raw water hs was the most predominant fraction on average 64 of hydrophilic doc range 61 66 followed by bb average 18 range 17 18 lmwn average 12 range 10 13 and bp average 6 range 4 8 indicating that nom characteristics did not vary considerably in terms of hs bb and lmwn the proportion of bp in raw water was higher in autumn than in winter and bp was probably derived from algal biomass that has been previously detected in the lake 32 feem showed a higher fluorescence intensity at the region associated with fulvic acid like nom excitation emission 320 415 than at the regions associated with humic acid like excitation emission 270 460 and protein like excitation emission 280 330 components fig s2 the fluorescence index value 1 5 and humification index value 0 5 of raw water suggested that the nom was mostly derived from terrestrial sources 33 but its degree of humification was low in comparison to values previously reported approximately 0 9 in nordic dwtps 2 the low humification index value likely reflected the low molecular weight of hs 34 and the low aromaticity of nom the bdoc of raw water was on average 0 2 mg l composing 4 2 of doc fig 3j these analytical methods indicate that the biodegradability and degree of humification of raw water nom were low and that hs was the major fraction in cff the removal was more efficient for larger molecules hs and bp 61 82 removal than for lighter fractions 0 20 removal fig 3 these unit processes removed hydrophobic and high molecular weight compounds more efficiently than they removed hydrophilic low molecular weight compounds in addition an apparent reduction in fluorescence intensity was observed fig s2 for fulvic acid like and humic acid like feem components the signal reductions were 52 59 and 59 69 respectively while the signal reduction of the protein like component was highly variable fig 4 the protein like signal is taken from a feem region very close to where raman scattering affects it this may be part of the reason for the high variability the greater removal of humic acids compared with fulvic acids is in agreement with previous laboratory studies and could be due to the greater hydrophobicity of humic acids than fulvic acids and the different removal pathways of these fractions 35 cff significantly p 0 05 removed on average 50 of the bdoc from the raw water fig 3j this was possibly due to the efficient removal 61 76 of bp fig 3a b bp has been shown to be the most biodegradable fraction of nom in a drinking water biofilter 36 while lmwn formed the major part of the bdoc of lake water used as raw water for a dwtp in another study the other lc ocd fractions including bp also contributed substantially to the bdoc 4 the clo2 oxidation dosage 0 2 g m3 approximately 0 07 mg mg toc increased the proportion of hs with 18 22 fig 3d and reduced the proportion of lmwn with 5 12 fig 3h humic acid like feem representing both dissolved and particulate nom also increased by 11 25 after clo2 oxidation fig 4f laboratory batch studies with a considerably higher clo2 dose 1 2 mg clo2 mg doc showed that clo2 oxidation of nom fractions can cause a blue shift and an intensity increase in the fluorescence band attributed to humic acid possibly resulting from the breakup of molecules into smaller fragments 37 in the present study the detected increase in the concentration of hs and concurrent increase in doc 0 04 0 17 mg l could be due to the oxidation of particulate organic carbon into doc compounds this possibility was raised in a study where cl2 was applied as a preoxidant and lc ocd was used for nom characterisation 38 and in a study conducted at the same dwtp as the present study in which size exclusion chromatography with uv and fluorescence detectors were used for characterisation 19 these detectors unlike the lc ocd applied in the present study are unable to detect all organic carbon compounds another explanation for the increased hs could be that the low doses of oxidants polymerise or aggregate some low molecular weight compounds 39 the mechanism of clo2 oxidation differs from that of ozonation when ozone reacts with dissolved organic matter it can oxidise hs thereby increasing the concentration of lower molecular size fractions bb lmwa and reducing the intensities of both humic and protein like feem components 40 the clo2 oxidation resulted in a slight but significant increase average increase of 0 05 mg l p 0 05 in the concentration of bdoc fig 3j at the same time the formation of low concentrations 0 02 mg l fig 3i of lmwa was observed the bdoc formation in the reaction of nom with high doses 0 5 2 mg mg organic carbon of clo2 has been previously associated with the decay of high molecular weight structures in the range of 3500 500 da and the formation of new low molecular weight by products with molecular weight 300 da such as carboxylic acids 18 it is possible that part of the lmwa formed with the moderate clo2 dose 0 07 mg mg organic carbon applied in the present study was easily biodegradable carboxylic acids that contributed to the increase of bdoc sand filtration resulted in a slight removal of the protein like feem component fig 4c d and variable removal of bdoc bp and lmwn fig 3j a b g h likely due to the physical filtration of residual flocs that remained in the water after flotation as discussed in section 3 1 1 and possibly due to biodegradation of nom by the microbial communities in the filters microbial activity in the sand filters cannot be overruled since the influent water coming from cff did not contain disinfectants as the very moderate dose of clo2 was consumed in the oxidation basin however the low water temperatures 0 4 3 4 c on days 109 235 would have likely slowed down biological activity 3 2 2 removal in gac filters after cff clo2 oxidation and sand filtration the influent of the gac filters had an almost equal proportion of hs 39 and bb 35 followed by lmwn 21 and bp 4 the removal of all major remaining size fractions hs bb and lmwn and feem components fulvic acid like humic acid like and protein like declined over time in both gac filters and the removal of these fractions and components was consistently higher in filter b than in filter a figs 3 and 4 the gac filters preferentially removed lmwn this removal was reduced from 32 to 6 in filter a and from 52 to 16 in filter b from day 60 to day 166 small molecular weight fractions of nom such as lmwn measured in present study are known to undergo preferential adsorption onto gac since they have access to the greatest volume of pores and they have higher diffusion coefficients than the larger molecules 41 42 bb and hs were removed by 5 15 and 4 16 respectively in filter a and by 12 34 and 8 26 respectively in filter b the removal of bp was low in both filters and the effluent concentrations of bp on day 166 exceeded the influent concentration which appears as the negative removal efficiencies in fig 3b the increased concentration of bp in the gac effluent water fig 3b possibly reflected biological activity in the filters since the filters harboured active bacterial biomass albeit at low concentrations as discussed later in section 3 3 effluents of biologically active gac filters can contain soluble microbial products from dead cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps consisting mainly of polysaccharides and proteins that are detected in the bp fraction by lc ocd 8 26 fulvic acid like and humic acid like feem components were removed more efficiently 32 69 signal reduction fig 4b and f than the protein like component 17 46 signal reduction in gac filters a and b fig 4d the effect of temperature on the removal of individual feem components can differ depending on the principal sorption mechanism i e chemisorption or physisorption 43 however in the present study the decrease in temperature occurred concomitantly with the decrease in sorption capacity thus the effects of these two phenomena on the sorption of feem components are difficult to distinguish from each other comparison of nom characteristics showed that the distributions of nom fractions were similar after filtration regardless of the gac used although the concentration of most nom components was lower in the effluent of filter b than of filter a figs 3 and 4 overall the effluent of the gac filters consisted of hs 41 and bb 35 followed by lmwn 17 and bp 5 confirming that gac filtration mainly reduced the proportion of lmwn in the sand filtered water removal of lmwn in gac filtration is important since these compounds were poorly removed in cff and they can be significant precursors of disinfection by products especially dihaloacetic acids 44 the reduction of bdoc was negligible in gac filter a on all sampling days and was noticeable only on day 60 in filter b 0 1 mg l of bdoc removed fig 3j although both filters efficiently removed lmwn 27 52 removal fig 3g h and all feem components 31 69 signal reduction fig 4 on days 60 and 109 the filters clearly improved the water quality by removing several fractions of nom that could react with the final disinfectant and form undesirable disinfection by products nevertheless the filters did not seem to remove bdoc specifically the poor removal of bp fig 3a b may have contributed to the low removal of bdoc by the gac filters removal of bdoc by gac filters is often associated with biodegradation by the microbial communities colonising the gac 8 lack of bdoc removal was reported in gac filters at low raw water temperatures on average 5 c in winter 45 in the dwtp of seoul 4 although the nom characteristics of the on river reservoir differed from those of the raw water in present study in the current study the bdoc removal by the filters was analysed on three occasions when the raw water temperatures were 11 1 3 4 and 0 6 c in particular the temperatures below 4 c on the last two occasions may have reduced the microbial activity 46 however despite the generally low bdoc removal in gac filters the combined operation of sand and gac filtration together removed the increased bdoc caused by clo2 oxidation and the concentrations of bdoc in the effluents of both gac filters were below 0 15 mg l at all sampling times suggesting that the produced water had a low regrowth potential 47 toc removal is a suitable parameter for constant monitoring of gac filter performance however the characterisation of nom is important because the toc measurement does not reveal any information about the biodegradability of nom or its potential to form disinfection by products the present study indicates that the removal of bp was linked to bdoc removal thus bdoc determination or a method that can quantify biodegradable organic compounds should be used at dwtps to ensure that the operation of the gac filters is optimal for controlling the bacterial regrowth potential in the distribution network feem and lc ocd are complementary methods as feem analysis of unfiltered water describes both the dissolved and particulate carbon while lc ocd is able to estimate the molecular size distribution of the dissolved nom information about the different nom size fractions is important as their presence can be linked for example to the formation of disinfection by products 48 the constant characterisation of nom in gac effluents is not feasible due to the additional labour required and the instrumentation needed to conduct these analyses nevertheless it should be conducted whenever the raw water quality or treatment processes change in those situations the nom characteristics should be studied in all stages of the treatment train nom concentrations are known to be increasing in boreal conditions 1 therefore detailed characterisation at planned intervals e g every ten years would be recommended in order to optimise the treatment processes to handle possible changes in nom characteristics 3 3 nom removal mechanisms in gac filters when the adsorption sites of gac filters become saturated the filters can evolve into biologically activated carbon bac filters where microbes colonise the surface of the gac the nom removal in gac bac filtration has been described as a four stage process 1 physical adsorption 2 concurrent adsorption and biological degradation 3 biological degradation and 4 diminishing biodegradation 8 the nom removal mechanisms involved sorption and or biodegradation were determined by measuring the sorption capacity as iodine number and the concentration of active bacterial biomass as atp from gac samples from both filters at different toc removal phases day 0 iodine number only 61 110 and 166 or 200 of the operation of filter a fig 5 in the present study the sorption capacity estimated by iodine number declined rapidly during the first 100 days fig 5b resulting in a sharp decline in the removal of toc and uv254 by the filters fig 2c f the concentration of active bacterial biomass was consistently less than 200 ng atp g gac in both filters fig 5a or comparable to the concentrations 170 ng g gac measured in full scale filters operated at 4 10 c at another finnish dwtp 49 but low in comparison with those observed elsewhere in a full scale gac filter 609 ng g gac 29 and a pilot scale filter 800 1830 ng g gac at 7 c 50 the low concentration of active bacterial biomass in both filters suggests that the observed difference in toc and uv254 removal of the two filters fig 2 was more likely due to the differences in adsorption than to differences in biodegradation of nom this conclusion was also supported by the low removal of bdoc in both filters as discussed earlier in section 3 2 2 water temperature 11 1 3 5 and 0 5 c on the sampling days did not have any clear impact on the concentration of active bacterial biomass fig 5a in current study used gacs were replaced with virgin ones at the end of the summer consequently a period of initial high physical adsorption detected as a decrease in the iodine number coincided with the period of the highest water temperature figs 2a and 5 b when the toc removals had dropped to 15 and 22 after 102 days of filter operation the water temperature had dropped to 5 c and it further decreased to 1 c within a month thereby disfavouring biodegradation 51 dwtps operating in cold conditions could potentially enhance the conditions for biodegradation by considering the yearly raw water temperature variation as one factor when scheduling the replacement of exhausted carbon with virgin or regenerated carbon the measured difference in iodine numbers fig 5b of the studied gacs could explain at least in part their different toc removal capacities fig 2g although the properties of the two gacs as provided by the manufacturers indicated that the two were similar table 1 one advisable check might be to determine the sorption properties of each gac batch to judge how fast the toc removal capacity will be depleted in dwtps the cost of the gac also affects the final decision when selecting certain gac types for use the cost and environmental impact of gac can be reduced by the regeneration of the exhausted carbon for reuse 52 while the present study discusses the differences of virgin carbons further research is needed to study the whole life cycle of carbons and the ability of different carbons to recover their adsorption capacity after regeneration 4 conclusions the present study evaluated the removal of different nom components from humic lake water at ambient temperatures 0 4 18 5 c in a full scale dwtp that uses chlorine dioxide for oxidation and two different carbons in gac filters cff removed on average 53 of the toc and it was also the most effective process stage for the removal of bdoc high molecular weight fractions hs bp and humic and fulvic acid like feem components clo2 oxidation increased the concentration of bdoc and hs apparently by oxidising particulate organic matter whereas the concentration of lmwn decreased possibly due to their polymerisation or aggregation the toc removals of gacs measured as g toc kg added gac differed by 25 during the eight month study due to differences in their sorption capacity despite the similar physical properties of the carbons both gacs preferentially removed lmwn and gave similar distributions of nom fractions in their effluents although the quantities removed differed the low concentration of active bacterial biomass and the poor removal of bdoc in both gacs suggested that adsorption rather than biodegradation was the main nom removal mechanism dwtps can improve the removal of nom by selection of gac with the highest cumulative toc removal capacity g toc kg gac based on full scale comparisons of gacs in the conditions of the dwtp as nom concentrations are expected to increase in boreal surface waters due to climate change the detailed characterisation of nom components in all the stages of the treatment train should be a regular requirement to adjust the operational parameters of dwtps to changing conditions declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13514,the removal of different natural organic matter nom components from boreal lake water was studied at ambient temperature 0 4 18 5 c in a full scale drinking water treatment plant dwtp the specific aim was to compare the performance of granular activated carbon gac filters containing different commercial carbons liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd fluorescence excitation and emission matrices feem and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc analyses showed that surface water nom was dominated by humic substances hs had the highest fluorescence intensity at the region associated with fulvic acid like nom and contained on average 0 2 mg l of bdoc coagulation flocculation and flotation removed 61 82 of hs and biopolymers and on average 50 of the bdoc chlorine dioxide oxidation increased the proportion of hs with 18 22 and the concentration of bdoc with on average 0 05 mg l while it decreased the proportion of low molecular weight neutrals lmwn sand and gac filtration removed bdoc to a level below 0 15 mg l the two studied gacs showed a 25 difference in their cumulative total organic carbon toc removals the distributions of nom fractions were similar in the effluents of both filters with lmwn being the most efficiently removed fraction nom removal was due to adsorption rather than biodegradation in the filters in conclusion dwtps benefit from complementary analyses such as lc ocd feem and bdoc for understanding and optimising nom removal comparison of different gacs in full scale studies is also important due to differences in the toc removals of gacs with similar product specifications keywords granular activated carbon filtration nom characterisation adsorption biodegradation 1 introduction many drinking water treatment plants dwtps need to improve their treatment processes to provide high quality potable water from surface waters that are currently experiencing continuously increasing levels and variable quality of natural organic matter nom 1 the nom origin and its characteristics such as its molecular size distribution biodegradable fraction and fluorophore composition are catchment area specific and may vary seasonally 2 4 in addition further changes in both quantity and quality of nom are expected due to the impacts of climate change on local hydrology 1 if not sufficiently removed by the dwtps nom can contribute to an unpleasant colour taste and odour of drinking water as well as to the formation of carcinogenic disinfection by products and bacterial regrowth in the distribution networks 5 typically dwtps apply a combination of several unit processes such as coagulation flocculation clarification oxidation and filtration to achieve their nom removal targets coagulation flocculation followed by clarification removes mainly hydrophobic high molecular weight nom compounds 6 after floc removal in the clarification stage oxidation with ozone is commonly applied as a disinfectant and to alter the structure of organic compounds thereby improving the removal of nom in subsequent processes 7 thereafter granular activated carbon gac filtration is used to finalise the removal of partially oxidised nom by adsorption and or biodegradation 5 8 depending on the properties of gac the operational regimes and the quality of the influent water studies in dwtps with gac filtration and ozonation have shown that the adsorption of nom fractions increases with decreasing molecular size 9 and that both the low and intermediate molecular weight fractions of nom are efficiently adsorbed 10 some dwtps use clo2 rather than ozone for oxidation 11 13 for example tampere water finland has used clo2 oxidation followed by sand and gac filtration for over 20 years in a dwtp to produce drinking water from boreal lake water the reasons for selecting clo2 oxidation over ozonation include a less complex technology and lower maintenance requirements and investment costs as well as the low formation of bromate and bromoform 14 16 the downside of choosing clo2 is that ozone reportedly changes the molecular weight distribution of nom and increases its biodegradability more efficiently than is achieved with clo2 as shown in laboratory batch studies 17 18 previous studies have illustrated the formation and fate of disinfection by products and the removal of different molecular weight fractions of nom in dwtps that use clo2 oxidation 12 19 however to our knowledge the impacts of clo2 oxidation on nom characteristics have not been investigated in detail in full scale dwtps using advanced and multiple complementary nom characterisation tools such as liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd fluorescence excitation and emission matrices feem and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc analyses detailed nom characterisation both in terms of its physico chemical properties and biodegradability is required in order to understand the composition changes of nom in the treatment train and to improve the operation of dwtps the potential of gac filters to remove nom is affected by the characteristics of the specific gac used and by the characteristics of the nom in the influent 5 8 as well as by the process conditions such as the temperature 20 the various available gacs differ in their raw material makeup and in their physico chemical characteristics such as pore size distribution surface chemistry and surface area 21 22 these differences impact their sorption capacity measured as the iodine number as well as their ability to maintain the active microbial biomass measured as adenosine triphosphate atp required to biodegrade nom recent laboratory studies in carefully controlled conditions have provided important basic information on the mechanisms of adsorption and biodegradation in gac filters 22 23 but full scale studies are necessary to understand the removal of nom at dwtps where changes in temperature influent water quality and process variables such as backwashing influence the performance of gac filtration 10 thus the determination of the feasibility of different gacs for efficient nom removal would benefit from a systematic comparative full scale study using advanced complementary analyses of both gac and water quality under ambient conditions dwtps that use alternative oxidants such as clo2 are missing this type of information needed for the optimisation of nom removal the aim of the present study was to evaluate the removal of nom components at ambient temperatures 0 4 18 5 c in the sequential unit processes of a full scale dwtp that uses boreal humic lake water as a water source and applies clo2 for oxidation lc ocd feem and bdoc analyses were applied to characterise nom in terms of its molecular size fractions fluorophore composition and biodegradability respectively in particular the goal was to compare the nom removal and its mechanisms between two activated carbons used in gac filters 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water treatment plant the study was conducted at a dwtp tampere water finland which in 2018 produced about 70 annually ca 13 million m3 of the drinking water for the over 200 000 inhabitants in the city of tampere and surrounding communities raw water for the plant is taken from lake roine surface area 55 km2 at a depth of 4 5 m which is 2 m above the bottom of the lake the treatment train includes coagulation ferric sulphate and flocculation followed by flotation cff chlorine dioxide clo2 oxidation 0 2 g m3 sand filtration gac filtration post chlorination and ultraviolet uv disinfection fig 1 the gac filtration stage consists of several parallel down flow filters all activated carbons in the filter beds are either regenerated or replaced with virgin gac once a year to achieve the target concentration of total organic carbon toc 2 5 mg l in drinking water 2 2 setup and properties of the gac filters two down flow gac filters referred to henceforth as filters a and b were filled with different commercial activated carbons gac a or b the filters were followed for eight months from the startup of the filters august 2017 until april 2018 the properties of the gacs are given in table 1 the virgin carbons 1 5 m layer 45 m3 were added to the basins gac a 2nd august referred to as day 0 of the study and gac b 10th august after which the carbons were rinsed with water 120 m3 for 10 min every 2 h over 24 h a total of 12 rinse cycles and the rinse water was discharged into the sewage system after the initial rinse the flow rate in the filters was gradually increased from 60 m3 h to the normal operational flow rate within three days during operation the empty bed contact time ebct was approximately 14 min at a flow rate of 200 m3 h the actual flow rate was measured and used in the planning of backwashing the gac filters were regularly backwashed with chlorinated product water to release bound organic and inorganic substances and to avoid filter clogging 24 the backwashing was typically performed every 3 7 days based on the head loss the backwashing procedure included an upflow rinse with water 1 min 20 s an air scour 1 min 15 s a final upflow rinse with water 10 min and a downflow prefiltration 8 min during which the water was discharged into the sewage system 2 3 sampling the toc concentration at different stages of the treatment train raw water flotation clo2 oxidation and sand filtration was followed regularly as a part of the monitoring programme of the dwtp the raw water temperature was taken as the daily average of online measurements the performance of the studied gac filters was monitored through grab samples of influent and effluent from both filters taken every 1 4 weeks and analysed for turbidity ph toc and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 the nom characterisation lc ocd feem and bdoc of water from different stages of the treatment process raw water after flotation after clo2 oxidation after sand filtration effluent of gac filter a and effluent of gac filter b fig 1 was performed three times based on the observed change in toc removals 1 from 19 to 35 day 60 of operation of filter a 2 from 12 to 19 day 109 and 3 from 7 to 15 day 166 or day 235 in the case of bdoc analysis the samplings for nom characterisation were timed at 2 9 h after backwashing of the filters water samples for toc uv254 and nom characterisations were collected in glass bottles previously acid washed or heated at 450 c for 2 h except for new borosilicate glass bottles for lc ocd analysis which were soaked in ultrapure deionised water for three days and rinsed with ultrapure water the concentration of active bacterial biomass on the gac was determined three times at days 61 110 and 200 of the operation of filter a and the iodine number of gac samples was determined four times after the initial 24 h rinse and on days 61 110 and 166 of the operation of filter a the surface morphology of the carbons was analysed using scanning electron microscopy sem after the initial 24 h rinse and on day 166 the sampling times were chosen so that they represent different toc removal phases as explained above the gac samples were collected with a core sampler at 0 1 m below the surface of the filter beds 2 4 analytical methods and calculations water samples were analysed for turbidity and ph according to standard methods sfs en iso 7027 1 2016 sfs 3021 1979 uv254 representing aromatic nom and toc were measured as sum parameters of nom with shimadzu uv 1800 and shimadzu toc vcph instruments sfs en 1484 1997 respectively total toc removals g toc kg of added gac at the end of the study were calculated as follows 1 m g a c i 1 n v δ t i 0 5 c i n f i 1 c i n f i 0 5 c e f f i 1 c e f f i where m g a c the

triplicate by incubating sterile filtered water samples 200 ml with an indigenous bacterial inoculum 2 ml of raw water for four weeks at 20 c according to the method of servais et al 25 but with the following three modifications 1 all glassware used in the analysis was heated at 450 c for 2 h to remove trace organics 2 the 0 2 μm membrane filters used for the sterilisation of samples were first rinsed with 300 ml of 60 c ultrapure water and then with 300 ml of the water sample to avoid the release of organic matter 3 toc in the duplicate samples taken at the beginning and end of the 4 week incubation were analysed immediately after sampling with the shimadzu toc vcph statistically significant differences were determined using two tailed t tests p values less than 0 05 were considered

fluorescence excitation and emission matrices feem were recorded with fluorolog 3 horiba scientific inc using a 1 cm cuvette and the following wavelengths excitation 235 515 nm 10 nm increments and emission 230 nm 645 nm 5 nm increments prior to the measurements nonfiltered water samples and deionised water milliq were tempered at 20 c in an incubator measured deionised water feems and information from the instrument were used for corrections of sample specific feems humic acid like fulvo acid like and protein like fluorescence peak intensities as well as the humification index 27 and fluorescence index 28 were calculated using equations shown in the references except that the nearest wavelength was used in cases where the specified wavelength had not been measured further details of the feem measurements and calculations are given in text s1 atp concentrations in gac samples were analysed according to velten et al 29 to quantify the concentration of active bacterial biomass duplicate gac samples were pretreated by rinsing them in sterile phosphate buffer atp concentrations were measured in three subsamples of each pre treated gac iodine numbers which serve as relative indicators of the sorption capacity of gac were determined on carbon samples based on three point adsorption isotherms r2 0 959 0 999 according to a standard protocol sfs en 12902 2005 sem zeiss ultra plus was employed to study the surface morphology of gac samples the samples were dried at 105 c before the analysis and sputter coated with carbon 3 results and discussion 3 1 routine dwtp monitoring 3 1 1 raw water quality and toc and uv254 removal in the unit processes preceding gac filtration the toc concentration of raw water was 6 1 0 2 mg l during the eight month study table 2 while the water temperature varied considerably the raw water temperature decreased gradually from 18 3 c to below 1 c in 4 5 months and stayed below 1 5 c during the last 3 5 months fig 2 a the water temperature in the treatment process was close 1 c difference to that of raw water the raw water toc has increased by approximately 0 5 mg l over the last two decades as indicated by comparison of the present results with those of matilainen et al 30 this increase is in line with the generally increasing trend in surface water toc concentrations in nordic countries 1 the treatment stages prior to gac filtration removed on average 56 of toc and 74 of uv254 table 2 from the raw water during the eight month study the toc concentration decreased constantly from 6 1 0 2 mg l in the raw water to 2 6 0 1 mg l in the influent of gac filters table 2 despite the decrease in water temperature cff removed on average 53 of the raw water toc thus cff with ferric sulphate coagulant can remove toc consistently independent of the raw water temperature thereby confirming the suitability of ferric salt coagulants regardless of the temperature 31 clo2 oxidation had no impact on the toc concentration or on uv254 indicating that nom was not mineralised and the aromatic character of nom did not change sand filtration removed only 6 of the remaining toc but 56 of uv254 likely due to the removal of the strongly uv254 absorbing residual flocs 3 1 2 gac filter performance toc turbidity and uv254 removal the performance of the two gac filters a and b containing commercial activated carbons was monitored for the removal of toc and uv254 beginning from the filling of the filters and for the next eight months at that time the toc removal fig 2d had stabilised to approximately 7 filter a and 15 filter b during the study the ph filter a ph 7 6 8 7 and filter b ph 7 6 8 5 and the turbidity of the gac filter effluents followed mostly the gac influent ph ph 7 4 8 6 and turbidity fig 2b due to the preceding treatment stages the influent water turbidity was generally low on average 0 07 ntu fig 2b but the gac filters reduced turbidity during occasional events of elevated influent turbidity for example on days 166 and 179 fig 2b in both filters the removal of toc and uv254 followed a similar declining trend over time but consistently more toc and uv254 absorbing compounds were removed by filter b than by filter a fig 2c g both filters removed 80 of the toc and 88 97 of uv254 in the influent water during the first days after the startup fig 2d and f thereby lowering the toc concentration to about 0 5 mg l fig 2c the toc removal decreased during the first three months so toc removal was 15 in filter a and 22 in filter b after 102 days from day 109 onwards until the end of the study 256 days the toc removals were on average 9 range 0 15 in filter a and 15 range 9 22 in filter b while the uv254 removals were on average 19 range 15 24 and 26 range 18 31 respectively after 109 days the average effluent toc concentrations were 2 4 0 1 and 2 2 0 1 mg l in filters a and b in total filter a removed approximately 610 kg of toc whereas filter b removed 840 kg of toc during the 8 month operation fig 2g mass balances are a useful tool for estimating the toc removal over time as shown in a pilot scale study that compared the doc uptake of two gac adsorbers that differed in their particle size influent water quality and backwashing regime 9 however mass balances are rarely used in full scale dwtp studies or to compare carbons with similar physical properties in the present study the toc removal per kg of gac differed by 25 41 g toc kg of added gac in filter b vs 33 g of toc kg of added gac in filter a fig 2g despite the similar physical properties reported by the manufacturers table 1 the sem micrographs also highlighted the similarity of the carbons fig s1 both gacs had heterogeneous irregular surface typical of coal based gacs and the surface morphology of the carbons did not differ notably at the beginning of the study or on day 166 due to the same raw material and particle size physical properties are generally used for gac selection at dwtps the results of the present study suggest that dwtps benefit from full scale comparisons of toc removal per kg of gac as a basis for the selection of gac 3 2 removal of nom components 3 2 1 raw water characteristics and removal in the treatment stages preceding gac filtration nom in the raw water and after each treatment stage was characterised in terms of molecular size distribution functional group composition and biodegradability using lc ocd feem and bdoc characterisation was conducted in three different toc removal stages of the gac filters 1 19 35 removal day 60 of operation of filter a 2 12 19 removal day 109 and 3 7 15 removal day 166 or day 235 these dates also corresponded to the different raw water temperatures 11 8 3 4 and 0 4 or 0 6 c respectively the two first analytical methods are complementary the feem based approach was used to determine the removal of fluorescent fulvic acid like humic acid like and protein like components of both particulate and dissolved organic carbon fig 4 whereas lc ocd separated both fluorescent and non fluorescent doc into five major components bp hs bb lmwn and lmwa based on their molecular size fig 3 fluorescence and humification indices were used to evaluate the origin of nom terrestrial versus microbial and the degree of humification respectively bdoc describes the biodegradable part of dissolved organic carbon and it was determined as a way to evaluate the impact of different treatment stages on the bacterial growth promoting properties of water fig 3j in raw water hs was the most predominant fraction on average 64 of hydrophilic doc range 61 66 followed by bb average 18 range 17 18 lmwn average 12 range 10 13 and bp average 6 range 4 8 indicating that nom characteristics did not vary considerably in terms of hs bb and lmwn the proportion of bp in raw water was higher in autumn than in winter and bp was probably derived from algal biomass that has been previously detected in the lake 32 feem showed a higher fluorescence intensity at the region associated with fulvic acid like nom excitation emission 320 415 than at the regions associated with humic acid like excitation emission 270 460 and protein like excitation emission 280 330 components fig s2 the fluorescence index value 1 5 and humification index value 0 5 of raw water suggested that the nom was mostly derived from terrestrial sources 33 but its degree of humification was low in comparison to values previously reported approximately 0 9 in nordic dwtps 2 the low humification index value likely reflected the low molecular weight of hs 34 and the low aromaticity of nom the bdoc of raw water was on average 0 2 mg l composing 4 2 of doc fig 3j these analytical methods indicate that the biodegradability and degree of humification of raw water nom were low and that hs was the major fraction in cff the removal was more efficient for larger molecules hs and bp 61 82 removal than for lighter fractions 0 20 removal fig 3 these unit processes removed hydrophobic and high molecular weight compounds more efficiently than they removed hydrophilic low molecular weight compounds in addition an apparent reduction in fluorescence intensity was observed fig s2 for fulvic acid like and humic acid like feem components the signal reductions were 52 59 and 59 69 respectively while the signal reduction of the protein like component was highly variable fig 4 the protein like signal is taken from a feem region very close to where raman scattering affects it this may be part of the reason for the high variability the greater removal of humic acids compared with fulvic acids is in agreement with previous laboratory studies and could be due to the greater hydrophobicity of humic acids than fulvic acids and the different removal pathways of these fractions 35 cff significantly p 0 05 removed on average 50 of the bdoc from the raw water fig 3j this was possibly due to the efficient removal 61 76 of bp fig 3a b bp has been shown to be the most biodegradable fraction of nom in a drinking water biofilter 36 while lmwn formed the major part of the bdoc of lake water used as raw water for a dwtp in another study the other lc ocd fractions including bp also contributed substantially to the bdoc 4 the clo2 oxidation dosage 0 2 g m3 approximately 0 07 mg mg toc increased the proportion of hs with 18 22 fig 3d and reduced the proportion of lmwn with 5 12 fig 3h humic acid like feem representing both dissolved and particulate nom also increased by 11 25 after clo2 oxidation fig 4f laboratory batch studies with a considerably higher clo2 dose 1 2 mg clo2 mg doc showed that clo2 oxidation of nom fractions can cause a blue shift and an intensity increase in the fluorescence band attributed to humic acid possibly resulting from the breakup of molecules into smaller fragments 37 in the present study the detected increase in the concentration of hs and concurrent increase in doc 0 04 0 17 mg l could be due to the oxidation of particulate organic carbon into doc compounds this possibility was raised in a study where cl2 was applied as a preoxidant and lc ocd was used for nom characterisation 38 and in a study conducted at the same dwtp as the present study in which size exclusion chromatography with uv and fluorescence detectors were used for characterisation 19 these detectors unlike the lc ocd applied in the present study are unable to detect all organic carbon compounds another explanation for the increased hs could be that the low doses of oxidants polymerise or aggregate some low molecular weight compounds 39 the mechanism of clo2 oxidation differs from that of ozonation when ozone reacts with dissolved organic matter it can oxidise hs thereby increasing the concentration of lower molecular size fractions bb lmwa and reducing the intensities of both humic and protein like feem components 40 the clo2 oxidation resulted in a slight but significant increase average increase of 0 05 mg l p 0 05 in the concentration of bdoc fig 3j at the same time the formation of low concentrations 0 02 mg l fig 3i of lmwa was observed the bdoc formation in the reaction of nom with high doses 0 5 2 mg mg organic carbon of clo2 has been previously associated with the decay of high molecular weight structures in the range of 3500 500 da and the formation of new low molecular weight by products with molecular weight 300 da such as carboxylic acids 18 it is possible that part of the lmwa formed with the moderate clo2 dose 0 07 mg mg organic carbon applied in the present study was easily biodegradable carboxylic acids that contributed to the increase of bdoc sand filtration resulted in a slight removal of the protein like feem component fig 4c d and variable removal of bdoc bp and lmwn fig 3j a b g h likely due to the physical filtration of residual flocs that remained in the water after flotation as discussed in section 3 1 1 and possibly due to biodegradation of nom by the microbial communities in the filters microbial activity in the sand filters cannot be overruled since the influent water coming from cff did not contain disinfectants as the very moderate dose of clo2 was consumed in the oxidation basin however the low water temperatures 0 4 3 4 c on days 109 235 would have likely slowed down biological activity 3 2 2 removal in gac filters after cff clo2 oxidation and sand filtration the influent of the gac filters had an almost equal proportion of hs 39 and bb 35 followed by lmwn 21 and bp 4 the removal of all major remaining size fractions hs bb and lmwn and feem components fulvic acid like humic acid like and protein like declined over time in both gac filters and the removal of these fractions and components was consistently higher in filter b than in filter a figs 3 and 4 the gac filters preferentially removed lmwn this removal was reduced from 32 to 6 in filter a and from 52 to 16 in filter b from day 60 to day 166 small molecular weight fractions of nom such as lmwn measured in present study are known to undergo preferential adsorption onto gac since they have access to the greatest volume of pores and they have higher diffusion coefficients than the larger molecules 41 42 bb and hs were removed by 5 15 and 4 16 respectively in filter a and by 12 34 and 8 26 respectively in filter b the removal of bp was low in both filters and the effluent concentrations of bp on day 166 exceeded the influent concentration which appears as the negative removal efficiencies in fig 3b the increased concentration of bp in the gac effluent water fig 3b possibly reflected biological activity in the filters since the filters harboured active bacterial biomass albeit at low concentrations as discussed later in section 3 3 effluents of biologically active gac filters can contain soluble microbial products from dead cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps consisting mainly of polysaccharides and proteins that are detected in the bp fraction by lc ocd 8 26 fulvic acid like and humic acid like feem components were removed more efficiently 32 69 signal reduction fig 4b and f than the protein like component 17 46 signal reduction in gac filters a and b fig 4d the effect of temperature on the removal of individual feem components can differ depending on the principal sorption mechanism i e chemisorption or physisorption 43 however in the present study the decrease in temperature occurred concomitantly with the decrease in sorption capacity thus the effects of these two phenomena on the sorption of feem components are difficult to distinguish from each other comparison of nom characteristics showed that the distributions of nom fractions were similar after filtration regardless of the gac used although the concentration of most nom components was lower in the effluent of filter b than of filter a figs 3 and 4 overall the effluent of the gac filters consisted of hs 41 and bb 35 followed by lmwn 17 and bp 5 confirming that gac filtration mainly reduced the proportion of lmwn in the sand filtered water removal of lmwn in gac filtration is important since these compounds were poorly removed in cff and they can be significant precursors of disinfection by products especially dihaloacetic acids 44 the reduction of bdoc was negligible in gac filter a on all sampling days and was noticeable only on day 60 in filter b 0 1 mg l of bdoc removed fig 3j although both filters efficiently removed lmwn 27 52 removal fig 3g h and all feem components 31 69 signal reduction fig 4 on days 60 and 109 the filters clearly improved the water quality by removing several fractions of nom that could react with the final disinfectant and form undesirable disinfection by products nevertheless the filters did not seem to remove bdoc specifically the poor removal of bp fig 3a b may have contributed to the low removal of bdoc by the gac filters removal of bdoc by gac filters is often associated with biodegradation by the microbial communities colonising the gac 8 lack of bdoc removal was reported in gac filters at low raw water temperatures on average 5 c in winter 45 in the dwtp of seoul 4 although the nom characteristics of the on river reservoir differed from those of the raw water in present study in the current study the bdoc removal by the filters was analysed on three occasions when the raw water temperatures were 11 1 3 4 and 0 6 c in particular the temperatures below 4 c on the last two occasions may have reduced the microbial activity 46 however despite the generally low bdoc removal in gac filters the combined operation of sand and gac filtration together removed the increased bdoc caused by clo2 oxidation and the concentrations of bdoc in the effluents of both gac filters were below 0 15 mg l at all sampling times suggesting that the produced water had a low regrowth potential 47 toc removal is a suitable parameter for constant monitoring of gac filter performance however the characterisation of nom is important because the toc measurement does not reveal any information about the biodegradability of nom or its potential to form disinfection by products the present study indicates that the removal of bp was linked to bdoc removal thus bdoc determination or a method that can quantify biodegradable organic compounds should be used at dwtps to ensure that the operation of the gac filters is optimal for controlling the bacterial regrowth potential in the distribution network feem and lc ocd are complementary methods as feem analysis of unfiltered water describes both the dissolved and particulate carbon while lc ocd is able to estimate the molecular size distribution of the dissolved nom information about the different nom size fractions is important as their presence can be linked for example to the formation of disinfection by products 48 the constant characterisation of nom in gac effluents is not feasible due to the additional labour required and the instrumentation needed to conduct these analyses nevertheless it should be conducted whenever the raw water quality or treatment processes change in those situations the nom characteristics should be studied in all stages of the treatment train nom concentrations are known to be increasing in boreal conditions 1 therefore detailed characterisation at planned intervals e g every ten years would be recommended in order to optimise the treatment processes to handle possible changes in nom characteristics 3 3 nom removal mechanisms in gac filters when the adsorption sites of gac filters become saturated the filters can evolve into biologically activated carbon bac filters where microbes colonise the surface of the gac the nom removal in gac bac filtration has been described as a four stage process 1 physical adsorption 2 concurrent adsorption and biological degradation 3 biological degradation and 4 diminishing biodegradation 8 the nom removal mechanisms involved sorption and or biodegradation were determined by measuring the sorption capacity as iodine number and the concentration of active bacterial biomass as atp from gac samples from both filters at different toc removal phases day 0 iodine number only 61 110 and 166 or 200 of the operation of filter a fig 5 in the present study the sorption capacity estimated by iodine number declined rapidly during the first 100 days fig 5b resulting in a sharp decline in the removal of toc and uv254 by the filters fig 2c f the concentration of active bacterial biomass was consistently less than 200 ng atp g gac in both filters fig 5a or comparable to the concentrations 170 ng g gac measured in full scale filters operated at 4 10 c at another finnish dwtp 49 but low in comparison with those observed elsewhere in a full scale gac filter 609 ng g gac 29 and a pilot scale filter 800 1830 ng g gac at 7 c 50 the low concentration of active bacterial biomass in both filters suggests that the observed difference in toc and uv254 removal of the two filters fig 2 was more likely due to the differences in adsorption than to differences in biodegradation of nom this conclusion was also supported by the low removal of bdoc in both filters as discussed earlier in section 3 2 2 water temperature 11 1 3 5 and 0 5 c on the sampling days did not have any clear impact on the concentration of active bacterial biomass fig 5a in current study used gacs were replaced with virgin ones at the end of the summer consequently a period of initial high physical adsorption detected as a decrease in the iodine number coincided with the period of the highest water temperature figs 2a and 5 b when the toc removals had dropped to 15 and 22 after 102 days of filter operation the water temperature had dropped to 5 c and it further decreased to 1 c within a month thereby disfavouring biodegradation 51 dwtps operating in cold conditions could potentially enhance the conditions for biodegradation by considering the yearly raw water temperature variation as one factor when scheduling the replacement of exhausted carbon with virgin or regenerated carbon the measured difference in iodine numbers fig 5b of the studied gacs could explain at least in part their different toc removal capacities fig 2g although the properties of the two gacs as provided by the manufacturers indicated that the two were similar table 1 one advisable check might be to determine the sorption properties of each gac batch to judge how fast the toc removal capacity will be depleted in dwtps the cost of the gac also affects the final decision when selecting certain gac types for use the cost and environmental impact of gac can be reduced by the regeneration of the exhausted carbon for reuse 52 while the present study discusses the differences of virgin carbons further research is needed to study the whole life cycle of carbons and the ability of different carbons to recover their adsorption capacity after regeneration 4 conclusions the present study evaluated the removal of different nom components from humic lake water at ambient temperatures 0 4 18 5 c in a full scale dwtp that uses chlorine dioxide for oxidation and two different carbons in gac filters cff removed on average 53 of the toc and it was also the most effective process stage for the removal of bdoc high molecular weight fractions hs bp and humic and fulvic acid like feem components clo2 oxidation increased the concentration of bdoc and hs apparently by oxidising particulate organic matter whereas the concentration of lmwn decreased possibly due to their polymerisation or aggregation the toc removals of gacs measured as g toc kg added gac differed by 25 during the eight month study due to differences in their sorption capacity despite the similar physical properties of the carbons both gacs preferentially removed lmwn and gave similar distributions of nom fractions in their effluents although the quantities removed differed the low concentration of active bacterial biomass and the poor removal of bdoc in both gacs suggested that adsorption rather than biodegradation was the main nom removal mechanism dwtps can improve the removal of nom by selection of gac with the highest cumulative toc removal capacity g toc kg gac based on full scale comparisons of gacs in the conditions of the dwtp as nom concentrations are expected to increase in boreal surface waters due to climate change the detailed characterisation of nom components in all the stages of the treatment train should be a regular requirement to adjust the operational parameters of dwtps to changing conditions declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of
