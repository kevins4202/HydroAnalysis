16940,for more than 50 years aluminum al salts have been used with varying degrees of success to inactivate excess mobile phosphorus p in lake sediments and restore lake water quality here we analyzed the factors influencing effectiveness and longevity of al treatments performed in six swedish lakes over the past 25 years trends in post treatment measurements of total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chl a secchi disk depth sd and internal p loading rates li were analyzed and compared to pre treatment conditions all measured water quality parameters improved significantly during at least the first 4 years post treatment and determination of direct effects of al treatment on sediment p release li was possible for three lakes improvements in tp 29 to 80 chl a 50 to 78 sd 7 to 121 and li 68 to 94 were observed treatment longevity determined via decreases in surface water tp after treatment varied from 7 to 47 years lake type al dose and relative watershed area were related to longevity in addition greater binding efficiency between al and p was positively related to treatment longevity which has not previously been shown our findings also demonstrate that adequate long term monitoring programs including proper determination of external loads are crucial to document the effect of al treatment on sediment p release and lake water quality keywords lake restoration aluminum treatment phosphorus internal loading sediment legacy phosphorus 1 introduction excess internal loading of phosphorus p in lakes a result of historical sediment p accumulation from external sources is often the most important driver of in lake p cycling and thus eutrophication e g pilgrim et al 2007 sondergaard et al 2003 external p sources e g leaching from agricultural soils and municipal industrial wastewater are the primary source of excess nutrients in lakes conley et al 2009 even when external nutrient sources are controlled recovery can be delayed by decades or longer due to the release of legacy or mobile p from lake sediments sas 1990 for more than 50 years aluminum al salts have been used to permanently inactivate excess mobile p in lake sediments and restore lake water quality huser et al 2016b welch and cooke 1999 the longevity of al treatment however has been highly variable with beneficial effects lasting from just a few months to more than 40 years egemose et al 2011 garrison and knauer 1984 huser et al 2011 huser et al 2016b james et al 1991 reported binding effectiveness measured as al al p or al pal ratios has varied by an order of magnitude i e between 2 1 and 21 1 agstam norlin et al 2020 huser et al 2011 huser 2012 jensen et al 2015 lewandowski et al 2003 reitzel et al 2005 rydin et al 2000 rydin and welch 1999 schütz et al 2017 treatment longevity and effectiveness are influenced by multiple factors including external loading lake morphology mixing regime bioturbation al dose and application method when external p loading remains elevated after al treatment ongoing p inputs can overwhelm al binding capacity resulting in new mobile sediment p accumulation over the treated layer and elevated internal p loading huser et al 2016c the ratio of lake to watershed areas wa la is an important predictor of treatment longevity as nutrient levels in lakes with large watersheds relative to lake area are more controlled by external sources than lakes with relatively small watersheds huser et al 2016b sas 1990 the rate of water renewal i e residence time can strongly affect treatment longevity as a long residence time can result in p being retained in the lake and sediment instead of moving to downstream water bodies sas 1990 morphology can decrease overall binding efficiency in lakes with steep bed slopes through translocation and focusing of the added al mineral al oh 3 in deep areas this is because freshly formed amorphous al minerals have a similar density to the surrounding organic rich sediment and a large fraction can rapidly within 6 months move down slope to deeper areas huser 2017 this can result in excess accumulation of al egemose et al 2012 huser 2012 and in the absence of available p the al mineral starts to crystalize resulting in a lower surface area and a loss of p binding sites berkowitz et al 2006 devicente et al 2008 huser 2012 huser 2017 the al dose used is another critical factor influencing longevity and effectiveness in the past al doses were often inadequate to bind all potentially releasable sediment p this was usually a result of old dosing calculation methods where dose was based on lake water alkalinity or hypolimnetic p instead of targeting the total pool of available mobile p in lake sediment cooke et al 2005 greater al doses tend to bind more p in the sediment which can increase longevity huser et al 2016b sas 1990 however adding too much al or using excessive amounts of al in one application will generally decrease binding efficiency due to crystallization of the al mineral before p binding occurs devicente et al 2008 with potentially negative effects on longevity agstam norlin et al 2020 huser 2012 mixing regime is also important shallow polymictic lakes tend to have shorter treatment longevity huser et al 2016b welch and cooke 1999 but the underlying mechanisms behind this are not entirely understood shallow lakes generally have lower water volume per area of sediment and thus alkalinity needed to support higher doses is often lower and as a consequence lower al doses have generally been added which per se decreases longevity huser et al 2016b dense populations of macrophytes often found in shallow polymictic lakes may increase internal loading by translocation of sediment p to the water column through plant decomposition or by stabilizing the water column and limiting oxygenation thus increasing the potential for internal loading welch and kelly 1990 in addition benthic feeding fish often have much greater negative impacts on nutrients and water quality in small shallow lakes relative to deeper stratified systems bajer and sorensen 2014 bioturbation caused by benthic feeding fish e g carp cyprinus carpio can deepen the active sediment layer and mass of p available for release to the water column huser et al 2016a especially in shallow polymictic lakes parkos et al 2003 weber and brown 2009 on the other hand enhanced sediment mixing by benthic feeding fish may result in higher al pal binding efficiency by increasing the chance of al to encounter p before crystallization of the mineral occurs huser et al 2016a different al application procedures have been used historically with the most commonly used method being application of al in solution to the water column and allowing the newly formed mineral to settle to the sediment surface welch and cooke 1999 however there is a newly developed technique where al is injected into surficial sediment 10 15 cm deep schütz et al 2017 the injection method minimizes al transport and focusing because the al floc is trapped in the vertical sediment profile which can lead to improved binding efficiency agstam norlin et al 2020 solid forms of al pellets have also been used historically cooke et al 2005 but a shift to liquid application occurred after the 1970s however binding effectiveness using pellets may be greater relative to liquid application in some cases agstam norlin et al 2020 treatment using al pellets has been tested recently in countries lacking equipment needed for liquid application kuster et al 2020 here we determined the longevity of al treatment and assessed the factors influencing effectiveness and longevity of al treatment using available monitoring data for six swedish lakes of varying size morphology al dose applied and application technique table 1 nutrient related water quality variables including historical trends for surface water chemistry quality were analyzed internal p release rates were calculated pre and post treatment when adequate data were available 2 methods 2 1 study sites additional information about all study sites including locations is presented in agstam norlin et al 2020 2 1 1 dimictic lakes six lakes situated within a 30 km radius of stockholm city were included in the study flaten is a 63 ha lake with a 403 ha catchment mostly covered by forest and recreational areas 70 al application was performed in 2000 with combined sediment injection and hypolimnetic water application using a total of 24 tons of al as pre hydrolyzed aluminum chloride pac pax xl100 areas of the lake where water column depth was between 6 and 9 m were treated with 30 g m2 al injected into the sediment and additionally 10 g m2 dispersed in the water near the sediment water interface deeper areas 9 10 m were dosed with 40 g m2 via sediment injection and 14 g m2 to the water at the deepest point of the lake 10 14 m 53 g m2 was injected and 17 g m2 added to the water table 1 partial water application was conducted to precipitate p already released from sediment trekanten is 13 5 ha lake with a catchment of 60 ha dominated by urban park areas al treatment was performed in 2011 using sediment injection of pac pax xl 100 60 g al m2 was applied to all lake areas where water depth was 4 m with a total al dose of 5 tons table 1 lejondalsjön has a surface area of 272 ha with a catchment of 1660 ha that is dominated by forest 58 agriculture crop and pasture fields 16 and urban areas 2 al treatment was performed during three consecutive years where a total of 28 6 tons of al as pac pax xl 60 was applied to the hypolimnetic lake water in 1991 a relatively low al dose 10 g m2 total of 5 tons was applied to the northern half of the lake where water depth was 10 m in 1992 three small test areas of the northern part of the lake total 12 ha were treated with a total al dose of 0 6 tons but with different areal doses 25 50 and 75 g m2 the final pac application in 1993 treated areas with water column depths exceeding 10 m 25 g m2 table 1 bagarsjön is an urban 6 ha lake with a catchment area of 135 ha that includes mainly residential 80 and small park forest areas al as pac pax xl 60 was applied in the hypolimnetic water at a total of 2 tons at a rate of 50 g m2 to areas with water depths greater than 2 m table 1 2 1 2 polymictic lakes långsjön is a 29 ha urban lake the 243 ha catchment is mainly residential with some recreational areas al pac pax xl100 was applied by direct sediment injection with different doses for different depth zones of the lake a dose of 25 g m2 was applied at water column depths between 1 5 and 2 m 50 g m2 at water column depths between 2 and 2 5 m and 75 g m2 from a water depth of 2 5 m to the maximum depth 3 3 m table 1 malmsjön is an 89 ha lake in an 1175 ha catchment dominated by forest 57 farmland 23 and urban areas 11 in total 53 ton of al pac pax xl100 was applied using sediment al injection the area specific al dose was 60 g m2 at all lake locations with a water column depth exceeding 1 m table 1 2 2 data handling average annual growing season may aug tp chlorophyll a chl a and secchi disk depth sd were used to describe differences in surface water quality between pre and post treatment periods in stratified lakes the increase in hypolimnetic tp during the growing season and corresponding hypolimnetic water volumes were used to calculate internal p loading rates li mg m2 day nürnberg 2009 a 4 year pre treatment period of annual means for sd chl a surface tp and li were compared with following post treatment 4 year periods to compare whether the parameters had changed due to al treatment four year periods were used in order to limit the effect of natural interannual variation longevity was estimated using three different methods for lakes where longevity had been reached i e no improvement was detected compared to pre treatment after a period of time longevity was defined as the year when annual mean or single august data point when seasonal data was lacking tp concentration exceeded one standard error of mean sem below mean pre treatment tp 4 year period for lakes where water quality improvements were still ongoing throughout the monitoring period e g malmsjön långsjön and bagarsjön but tp showed a linear increase post al treatment we estimated longevity using linear regression and extrapolation longevity was estimated as the time point where the linear regression exceeded one sem below pre al treatment mean tp 4 year period finally the longevity predicting equation lpeq of huser et al 2016b was used to estimate treatment longevity in cases where there was no deterioration of post treatment water quality through the end of the dataset eq 1 three variables described 82 of the variation in al treatment longevity in eq 1 including al dose watershed area to lake area ratio wa la and osgood index osgood 1988 it should be noted that this method for calculating longevity is almost certainly an underestimate as the regression developed weighted lakes highest where no external nutrient reduction occured in addition longevity predicted using lpeq has an arbitrary endpoint i e longevity is considered to end when surface tp is 50 of the pre treatment value and thus is not a true representation of longevity of positive treatment effects 1 log l o

variables improved after al treatment in all lakes table 2 flaten långsjön lejondalssjön bagarsjön and malmsjön had changes in all measured water quality variables during the first 4 years after al treatment whereas trekanten showed no initial increases in sd but tp declined substantially table 2 flaten långsjön malmsjön and trekanten had changes in all measured water quality variables at the end of each available data series 16 12 12 and 12 years post treatment respectively lejondalssjön had improved tp until 7 years post treatment and showed deeper sd throughout the monitoring period table 2 3 1 dimictic lakes 3 1 1 lejondalssjön tp decreased by 29 from 35 3 to 25 0 µg l mean values during the first 4 year post treatment during the second post treatment 4 year period the annual tp mean exceeded the pre treatment breaking point one sem below annual tp mean and longevity of the tp decline was 7 years table 2 fig 1 li decreased as well from a mean of 5 0 to 1 6 mg m2 day 68 over the first 4 year period post al treatment but during subsequent 4 year periods the li rate started to return to pre treatment conditions 2 9 mg m2 day table 2 fig 2 a sd increase of 40 was sustained throughout the available data series from an average of 2 9 m before treatment to an average of 4 1 m at the end of the data series 12 years post treatment 3 1 2 flaten surface tp averaged 33 5 µg l before treatment and decreased to 9 2 8 9 9 5 and 11 0 µg l during subsequent consecutive 4 year periods 4 8 12 and 16 years post treatment meaning the longevity of treatment with respect to surface water tp exceeded the end of this study there was a decrease chl a with concentrations declining from a pre treatment mean of 12 7 µg l to 2 8 3 2 5 4 and 4 7 µg l respectively for 4 8 12 and 16 years post treatment sd significantly improved as well increasing from a pre treatment mean of 2 9 m to 6 3 6 4 4 8 and 5 5 m during 4 8 12 and 16 years post treatment due to continued improvement of all nutrient related water quality variables fig 3 throughout the duration of monitoring treatment longevity could not be calculated but was instead estimated using lpeq to 37 years huser et al 2016b li decreased 90 for all available post treatment data with a pre treatment mean of 3 4 mg m2 day and post treatment averages were all below 0 3 mg m2 day table 2 fig 3 and 4 3 1 3 trekanten pre treatment tp averaged 53 1 µg l and decreased to a mean of 24 3 µg l during the first 4 years post treatment period and decreased further to 23 4 µg l through the end of the data set 5 8 years post treatment table 2 fig 5 chl a decreased from a 14 4 µg l pre treatment mean to 7 2 µg l and 5 9 µg l 4 and 8 years post treatment respectively sd however did not improve until the three last years of the study record table 2 and fig 5 li decreased by over 90 throughout the available data series initially at 3 3 mg m2 day before treatment and decreasing to 0 2 and 0 1 mg m2 day at 4 and 8 years post al treatment respectively fig 6 table 2 longevity was estimated to 47 years using lpeq 3 1 4 bagarsjön during the first two 4 year post treatment periods e g eight years tp was substantially lower compared to pre treatment decreasing from a mean of 60 3 µg l to 24 8 and increasing to 37 3 µg l respectively during the following 4 year period 9 12 years post treatment an increasing trend of tp was observed mean 43 0 µg l table 2 fig 6 however due to other management efforts such as freshwater dilution and hypolimnetic aeration during the 16 and 20 years post treatment periods tp decreased again and was lower than pre treatment conditions sd did increased with 59 and 41 at the first and second 4 year period post al treatment respectively at years 9 12 post treatment sd had decreased to 14 improvement table 2 fig 7 li was not analyzed due to lack of available data treatment longevity was determined to 14 years fig 7 3 2 polymictic lakes 3 2 1 långsjön all variables tp sd and chl a improved by over 50 through the end of the study data series 12 years post al treatment sd increased from a mean of 0 9 m to 1 7 m during the final post treatment period chl a decreased from a pre treatment mean of 53 6 µg l to 16 4 µg l and tp decreased from a mean 97 5 µg l to 46 5 µg l 4 8 and 12 years post treatment table 2 fig 8 longevity using the post treatment linear increase in surface water tp was estimated to be 21 years fig 8 3 2 2 malmsjön surface water tp concentrations decreased by over 50 in the three post al treatment periods 4 8 and 12 years post treatment the entire dataset pre treatment tp averaged 96 5 µg l and was 43 8 µg l at 12 years post treatment table 2 fig 9 longevity using the linear increase in surface tp after treatment was estimated to be 20 years no other water quality data were available for malmsjön 3 3 factors influencing longevity of al treatment principal components analysis pca including factors in table 1 was used to determine factors driving longevity and explained 79 of the variation in the data set with two components longevity was positively correlated to osgood index suggesting that deeper lakes dimictic have higher longevity than small polymictic lakes the analysis also showed that larger al doses were correlated with greater longevity al pal was negatively correlated to longevity meaning that poor binding efficiency i e high al pal results in lower longevity finally wa la also had a negative correlation to longevity suggesting that lakes with greater watershed area relative to lake area have shorter longevities fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 water quality response to al treatment 4 1 1 dimictic lakes three dimictic lakes lejondalssjön trekanten and flaten were historically monitored at a level required determining the effect of al treatment on surface water quality the data series from these lakes included monthly may september measurements of chl a sd and tp for both surface water and depth intervals covering the vertical water profile except for lejondalssjön which lacked pre treatment chl a data this provided the possibility to include within year may to august variation when studying historical trends in surface water quality vertical profiles with samples taken from different water depths enabled calculation of historical internal loading rates which are generally a better indicator of the effects of al treatment however this direct quantification of internal loading is only applicable to dimictic lakes where the lake remains stratified and hypolimnion remains stable throughout the growing season 4 1 1 1 lejondalssjön internal loading rates decreased 68 during the first 4 year period post al treatment during the following 4 year post treatment periods however internal loading gradually returned to levels not different to pre treatment conditions table 2 fig 1 2 this is likely due to a combination of factors the high amount of legacy mobile sediment p remaining after al treatment agstam norlin et al 2020 table 1 likely overwhelmed the al treatment as was the case for numerous historical treatments where al doses were added that were inadequate to bind the entire excess mobile p pool huser et al 2016b welch and cooke 1999 even though li improved substantially after treatment at least initially surface water tp only decreased by 29 during the first 4 year period this can likely be explained by ongoing excess external p inputs limited treatment longevity has been seen elsewhere when external loading was not reduced adequately or inadequate al doses were used egemose et al 2011 garrison and knauer 1984 huser et al 2011 huser et al 2016b james et al 1991 mehner et al 2008 thus the limited treatment longevity in lejondalssjön is likely explained by a combination of continued excess external loading and the low al dose 25 g m2 added dose calculation methods based on other variables besides sediment p were common before 2000 for lejondalssjön al dose was calculated based on the internal p loading rate kennedy et al 1987 one problem with this approach is that it only accounts for sediment p release during one year even though the sediment often contains enough mobile p to support many years of internal loading without looking at sediment p content it is impossible to determine how much mobile p exists in the sediment and thus underdosing of al is a likely result kuster et al 2020 4 1 1 2 flaten when this lake was treated in 2000 the understanding of al dosing had improved substantially and was based on the available pool of mobile p labile organic p p bound to fe and loosely sorbed porewater p in the lake sediment rydin 2000 the mean dose of al across the lake was 61 g m2 schütz et al 2017 however dose was adjusted higher or lower depending on the amount of mobile sediment p in different locations the application technique employed was also different compared to most al treatments a combination of sediment injection and hypolimnetic water application was used where approximately a fourth of the al dose was applied to the water and the rest injected into the sediment surface water tp concentrations decreased by over 60 due to al treatment and this decrease was sustained through the end of the data series table 2 fig 3 4 chl a had a similar response and remain reduced throughout the study period sd increased more than two fold which also was sustained through the end of the data series 4 1 1 3 trekanten the most recent treatment presented in this study was performed in 2011 in trekanten where a similar dose to that used in flaten was applied 60 g m2 however the application technique differed slightly and only sediment injection was used i e no water application as with flaten the al dose was determined from the amount of mobile p in the sediment the water quality data covered only two 4 year periods post treatment i e 8 years and showed a twofold decrease of tp and chl a throughout the measurement period table 2 fig 5 because internal loading rates decreased by nearly 100 but the lake water still has a tp concentration of nearly 25 µg l it seems likely that external sources of p are still elevated this may to some extent be due to sewage water pipes that had been incorrectly connected to storm water runoff pipes between 2006 and 2013 unfortunately contributing excess external p load during these years the excess external loading does not seem to have had an effect on internal loading fig 6 but if not controlled it is likely internal loading will return huser et al 2011 while sd did not initially improve post treatment there was an increasing trend from 7 during the first 4 year period to 20 increase at the end of the data set 5 8 years similar delayed effects have been seen after al treatment in a number of us lakes huser et al 2011 the lack of immediate response in sd does not seem to be controlled by algal presence because chl a decreased by 50 this suggests a number of alternatives e g sediment resuspension due to winds or benthic feeding fish causing sediment mixing bioturbation turbid storm water inflows or increasing water color total dissolved organic carbon that has been shown to be occurring in boreal regions across sweden and elsewhere de wit et al 2016 huser et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 unfortunately the lack of data did not allow us to explore any of these possible effects 4 1 1 4 bagarsjön whereas the previously described dimictic lakes were monitored in enough detail to calculate historical trends for li data for bagarsjön only included surface water tp and sd at one occasion per year august thus it was not possible to calculate li and within year variation seasonal mean could not be included in the analysis however the effect of al treatment on surface water tp was clear for the initial 4 year period fig 7 surface water tp began to increase after treatment but decreased again during the last two 4 year periods post treatment from 2009 this decrease is likely a result of another separate management action starting in 2009 when an aeration pump was installed in order to keep hypolimnetic water oxygenated there was no clear change in sd after 6 years post al treatment including after aeration started 4 1 2 polymictic lakes because polymictic lakes are generally shallow and well or partially mixed the lack of a well defined hypolimnion makes it is difficult to calculate internal loading rates dynamic modeling would be needed in such cases but monitoring of inflows and outflows was not conducted or data available were too sparse to use dynamic or even simple mass balance models surface water quality trends however could be analyzed and used to estimate treatment effect as has been done in previous studies huser et al 2016b welch and cooke 1999 4 1 2 1 långsjön historical water chemical data for tp sd and chl a together with water profile measurements of tp were available because the lake is polymictic often no accumulation of tp occurs in the bottom water which limits the possibility to estimate li however there was a positive effect for all measured parameters for all 12 years of post treatment data with all variables improving by 50 table 2 fig 8 it should be noted that other management actions including freshwater dilution were performed simultaneously to al treatment these actions will of course improve water quality due to dilution of nutrients in the lake external loading remains elevated however table 2 and will likely overwhelm the effects of al treatment in the future see longevity section below 4 1 2 2 malmsjön available water chemical data included surface water tp concentrations from single samples taken in august each year the lack of water column profile measurements of tp precluded calculation of internal loading making quantification of the direct effect of al treatment impossible despite the limited data available the effect of al treatment on surface water tp was clear for the complete data record surface water tp started to increase after treatment table 2 fig 9 and tp was estimated to return to pre treatment levels after 20 years 4 2 al treatment longevity in polymictic and dimictic lakes if external p sources are reduced sufficiently and al is added at a dose necessary to inactivate the entire legacy sediment p pool treatment longevity would theoretically be infinite once p is bound to al it is considered permanently inactivated welch and cooke 1999 and the sediment layer with elevated aluminum bound p will over time be buried by new sediment for most lakes discussed herein however external loading remains elevated in some cases substantially i e malmsjön and långsjön table 2 in these cases estimates of longevity are mainly a factor of how much external loading has been reduced with al dosing and treatment methods that affect how much al was added relative to legacy sediment p kuster et al 2020 and binding efficiency between al and p agstam norlin et al 2020 huser 2012 having a smaller effect 4 2 1 dimictic lakes nutrient cycling in flaten is mainly controlled by in lake processes rather than external sources due to the low wa la ratio 6 4 and low intensity of land use in the watershed further the al dose was relatively high mean 61 g m2 and mostly applied directly into the sediment rather than to the water column which likely increased binding efficiency mean 9 0 table 1 agstam norlin et al 2020 given that no increase has been detected for li or surface water tp after al treatment longevity in this case may be infinite the lpeq estimated treatment longevity in flaten was 37 years i e surface water tp increases to 50 of pre treatment which is above the mean treatment longevity 21 years for dimictic lakes huser et al 2016b however treatment longevity will likely be substantially longer than predicted using lpeq given no significant increase in li or surface water tp has been detected to date the treatment of trekanten was in many ways similar to the situation in flaten with an even lower wa la 4 3 similar sediment binding efficiency mean al pal 10 7 agstam norlin et al 2020 and a relatively high al dose mean 60 g m2 injected exclusively into the sediment because water quality was still improved with no decline throughout the measurement period a determination of total longevity was not possible with an lpeq estimated treatment longevity of 47 years it is possible that total longevity e g the time it takes for surface water tp to reach pre treatment levels may be a century or longer the treatment of bagarsjön differed from the previous two cases al was applied exclusively to the water column resulting in a lower binding efficiency mean al pal 16 0 agstam norlin et al 2020 additionally nutrient cycling and availability is likely controlled mostly by external sources because the lake has a relatively small area compared to the watershed wa la 22 5 these two factors likely decreased longevity 14 years which is lower than what would be predicted for an average dimictic lake huser et al 2016b similarly lejondalssjön also had a shorter than expected longevity 7 years which can be explained by other factors namely a low dose 25 g al m2 calculated using outdated methods applied to the water column together with moderately high binding efficiency mean al pal 11 4 4 2 2 polymictic lakes the longevity of the långsjön treatment was estimated to be 20 years using linear increase and extrapolation fig 8 of tp this is above the previously reported al treatment longevity of polymictic lakes mean 5 7 years according to huser et al 2016b the much longer predicted longevity can partly be explained by the relatively low wa la 8 4 meaning that in lake processes are likely more important than external sources for nutrient cycling långsjön was treated with a relatively high al dose mean 60 g m2 directly applied to the sediment which led to a moderately high binding efficiency mean al pal 12 9 further another restoration effort was simultaneously performed using freshwater dilution 30 l s since 2002 likely increasing longevity treatment longevity for malmsjön which was estimated at 20 years using the linear increase in surface water tp after treatment fig 9 was well over the typical range for polymictic lakes huser et al 2016b similar to långsjön direct sediment al application was done with a relatively high dose 60 g m2 binding efficiency mean al pal 14 6 and the wa la 13 2 were moderate in comparison to the other study lakes the generally shorter longevity in shallow polymictic lakes is not solely due to lake characteristics but because historically these types of lakes usually received lower al doses which per se results in short longevity because långsjön and malmsjön received relatively high al doses calculated using the mobile sediment p pool applied directly into the sediment increasing binding efficiency longevity exceeded expectations compared to earlier treatments agstam norlin et al 2020 huser et al 2016b 4 2 2 factors influencing al treatment longevity in this study we showed that observed factors generally controlling longevity for the most part follow current understanding in the literature al dose wa la and osgood index i e polymictic versus dimictic lakes drove longevity for the study lake similar to previous conclusions from huser et al al 2016b where 114 lakes were analyzed for factors controlling longevity and 82 of the variation in longevity was explained by wa la al dose and osgood index this is also supported by pca analysis of the study lakes fig 10 where a higher osgood index i e a greater chance for stratification was positively related to longevity and wa la ratios were negatively correlated al dose had a weak positive correlation to longevity possibly explained by the similarity of dose across the study lakes table 1 a new factor al pal ratios was also shown to control longevity with greater ratios i e lower binding efficiency being negatively correlated to longevity of treatment this is plausible as a lower binding efficiency means that less sediment p will be bound per unit al added 4 3 recommendations for assessing li with water quality monitoring the duration and intensity of lake water quality monitoring before and after al treatment constrains the evaluation of effectiveness and longevity in many situations it may not be sufficient to only measure changes in surface water nutrient related parameters such as sd chl a and tp in the lake this is because other restoration efforts may be used simultaneously and or external loading may remain high potentially masking the effect of al or other treatments designed to reduce internal phosphorus loading three dimictic lakes in this study were monitored in a sufficient manner to determine changes to li associated with al treatment lejondalssjön flaten and trekanten monthly water profile measurements of tp with multiple samples collected through the vertical water profile and temperature every meter made it possible to calculate the volume of the hypolimnion and the mass of tp in hypolimnetic water and follow the increase throughout the growing season when lake was stratified nürnberg 2009 higher resolution monitoring is likely needed in polymictic systems as in huser et al 2011 where biweekly observations were used to assess li this is due to the fact that internal loading events are likely shorter i e periodic stratification and or high ph events the polymictic långsjön was monitored monthly with vertical water chemical profiles and temperature at least every meter however assessing li using the same methods as for dimictic lakes was not possible due to the lack of stabile stratification during the growing season thus in polymictic shallow lakes monitoring of flow and nutrient concentrations is needed in the inlets as well so that external and internal loading can be differentiated further to assess li accurately it will generally be necessary to use dynamic modeling approaches including spatially representative information on sediment p forms and potential flux with data series covering pre and post periods of al treatment 5 conclusions an al dose adequate to bind legacy sediment p and appropriate treatment methods depending on lake morphological characteristics are crucial for sustainable restoration of surface water quality using al treatment al dose needs to be large enough to inactivate the entire pool of excess mobile p in the lake sediment which drives the long term potential for internal loading external load reduction is also important as continued excess p loading will eventually overwhelm any measure designed to reduce sediment p release as we showed in this study based on available data the positive effects from al treatment in two lakes flaten and trekanten are likely to last a century or longer on the other hand lakes with high levels of excess external loading had or will have shorter treatment longevity ranging from 7 to 21 years in addition elevated external loading will limit the positive effects of reduced internal loading in lejondalssjön internal loading was reduced substantially after al treatment before the treatment was overwhelmed by new p but surface water tp decreased by a much smaller amount due to continued elevated external loading assuming adequate reduction of external loads al dose becomes the most important factor for restoration success newer methods based on sediment p have been developed and have led to substantially greater treatment longevities primarily due to greater al doses being added however care should be taken with al doses added during one treatment as high single treatment doses decrease the overall efficiency of al treatment as was seen in malmsjön and can limit the amount of sediment p that is inactivated per unit al added doses should be split into smaller sub treatments to improve binding efficiency and increase the amount of p inactivated per unit al added finally al treatment success was based in most cases on surface water quality improvement in this study however the main goal of al treatment is to reduce p release from sediment we attempted to evaluate reduction in internal loading for all lakes but too often adequate data to do this were lacking in cases where variables such as tp chl a and sd have unexpected responses it is important to be able to evaluate whether these responses are due to internal external or both types of loading proper monitoring both before and after treatment is a necessary requirement to be able to evaluate and optimize methods to reduce p loading and eutrophication in

16940,for more than 50 years aluminum al salts have been used with varying degrees of success to inactivate excess mobile phosphorus p in lake sediments and restore lake water quality here we analyzed the factors influencing effectiveness and longevity of al treatments performed in six swedish lakes over the past 25 years trends in post treatment measurements of total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chl a secchi disk depth sd and internal p loading rates li were analyzed and compared to pre treatment conditions all measured water quality parameters improved significantly during at least the first 4 years post treatment and determination of direct effects of al treatment on sediment p release li was possible for three lakes improvements in tp 29 to 80 chl a 50 to 78 sd 7 to 121 and li 68 to 94 were observed treatment longevity determined via decreases in surface water tp after treatment varied from 7 to 47 years lake type al dose and relative watershed area were related to longevity in addition greater binding efficiency between al and p was positively related to treatment longevity which has not previously been shown our findings also demonstrate that adequate long term monitoring programs including proper determination of external loads are crucial to document the effect of al treatment on sediment p release and lake water quality keywords lake restoration aluminum treatment

wastewater are the primary source of excess nutrients in lakes conley et al 2009 even when external nutrient sources are controlled recovery can be delayed by decades or longer due to the release of

et al 2016b welch and cooke 1999 the longevity of al treatment however has been highly variable with beneficial effects lasting from just a few months to more than 40 years egemose et al 2011 garrison and knauer 1984 huser et al 2011 huser et al 2016b james et al 1991 reported binding effectiveness measured as al al p or al pal ratios has varied by an order of magnitude i e between 2 1 and 21 1 agstam norlin et al 2020 huser et al 2011 huser 2012 jensen et al 2015 lewandowski et al 2003 reitzel et al 2005 rydin et al 2000 rydin and welch 1999 schütz et al 2017 treatment longevity and effectiveness are influenced by multiple factors including external loading lake morphology mixing regime bioturbation al dose and application method when external p loading remains elevated after al treatment ongoing p inputs can overwhelm al binding capacity resulting in new mobile sediment p accumulation over the treated layer and elevated internal p loading huser et al 2016c the ratio of lake to watershed areas wa la is an important predictor of treatment longevity as nutrient levels in lakes with large watersheds relative to lake area are more controlled by external sources than lakes with relatively small watersheds huser et al 2016b sas 1990 the rate of water renewal i e residence time can strongly affect treatment longevity as a long residence time can result in p being retained in the lake and sediment instead of moving to downstream water bodies sas 1990 morphology can decrease overall binding efficiency in lakes with steep bed slopes through translocation and focusing of the added al mineral al oh 3 in deep areas this is because freshly formed amorphous al minerals have a similar density to the surrounding organic rich sediment and a large fraction can rapidly within 6 months move down slope to deeper areas huser 2017 this can result in excess accumulation of al egemose et al 2012 huser 2012 and in the absence of available p the al mineral starts to crystalize resulting in a lower surface area and a loss of p binding sites berkowitz et al 2006 devicente et al 2008 huser 2012 huser 2017 the al dose used is another critical factor influencing longevity and effectiveness in the past al doses were often inadequate to bind all potentially releasable sediment p this was usually a result of old dosing calculation methods where dose was based on lake water alkalinity or hypolimnetic p instead of targeting the total pool of available mobile p in lake sediment cooke et al 2005 greater al doses tend to bind more p in the sediment which can increase longevity huser et al 2016b sas 1990 however adding too much al or using excessive amounts of al in one application will generally decrease binding efficiency due to crystallization of the al mineral before p binding occurs devicente et al 2008 with potentially negative effects on longevity agstam norlin et al 2020 huser 2012 mixing regime is also important shallow polymictic lakes tend to have shorter treatment longevity huser et al 2016b welch and cooke 1999 but the underlying mechanisms behind this are not entirely understood shallow lakes generally have lower water volume per area of sediment and thus alkalinity needed to support higher doses is often lower and as a consequence lower al doses have generally been added which per se decreases longevity huser et al 2016b dense populations of macrophytes often found in shallow polymictic lakes may increase internal loading by translocation of sediment p to the water column through plant decomposition or by stabilizing the water column and limiting oxygenation thus increasing the potential for internal loading welch and kelly 1990 in addition benthic feeding fish often have much greater negative impacts on nutrients and water quality in small shallow lakes relative to deeper stratified systems bajer and sorensen 2014 bioturbation caused by benthic feeding fish e g carp cyprinus carpio can deepen the active sediment layer and mass of p available for release to the water column huser et al 2016a especially in shallow polymictic lakes parkos et al 2003 weber and brown 2009 on the other hand enhanced sediment mixing by benthic feeding fish may result in higher al pal binding efficiency by increasing the chance of al to encounter p before crystallization of the mineral occurs huser et al 2016a different al application procedures have been used historically with the most commonly used method being application of al in solution to the water column and allowing the newly formed mineral to settle to the sediment surface welch and cooke 1999 however there is a newly developed technique where al is injected into surficial sediment 10 15 cm deep schütz et al 2017 the injection method minimizes al transport and focusing because the al floc is trapped in the vertical sediment profile which can lead to improved binding efficiency agstam norlin et al 2020 solid forms of al pellets have also been used historically cooke et al 2005 but a shift to liquid application occurred after the 1970s however binding effectiveness using pellets may be greater relative to liquid application in some cases agstam norlin et al 2020 treatment using al pellets has been tested recently in countries lacking equipment needed for liquid application kuster et al 2020 here we determined the longevity of al treatment and assessed the factors influencing effectiveness and longevity of al treatment using available monitoring data for six swedish lakes of varying size morphology al dose applied and application technique table 1 nutrient related water quality variables including historical trends for surface water chemistry quality were analyzed internal p release rates were calculated pre and post treatment when adequate data were available 2 methods 2 1 study sites additional information about all study sites including locations is presented in agstam norlin et al 2020 2 1 1 dimictic lakes six lakes situated within a 30 km radius of stockholm city were included in the study flaten is a 63 ha lake with a 403 ha catchment mostly covered by forest and recreational areas 70 al

describe differences in surface water quality between pre and post treatment periods in stratified lakes the increase in hypolimnetic tp during the growing season and corresponding hypolimnetic water

treatment 4 year periods to compare whether the parameters had changed due to al treatment four year periods were used in order to limit the effect of natural interannual variation longevity was estimated using three different methods for lakes where longevity had been reached i e no improvement was detected compared to pre treatment after a period of time longevity was defined as the year when annual mean or single august data point when seasonal data was lacking tp concentration exceeded one standard error of mean sem below mean pre treatment tp 4 year period for lakes where water quality improvements were still ongoing throughout the monitoring period e g malmsjön långsjön and bagarsjön but tp showed a linear increase post al treatment we estimated longevity using linear regression and extrapolation longevity was estimated as the time point where the linear regression exceeded one sem below pre al treatment mean tp 4 year period finally the longevity predicting equation lpeq of huser et al 2016b was used to estimate treatment longevity in cases where there was no deterioration of post treatment water quality through the end of the dataset eq 1 three variables described 82 of the variation in al treatment longevity in eq 1 including al dose watershed area to lake area ratio wa la and osgood index osgood 1988 it should be noted that this method for calculating longevity is almost certainly an underestimate as the regression developed weighted lakes highest where no external nutrient reduction occured in addition longevity predicted using lpeq has an arbitrary endpoint i e longevity is considered to end when surface tp is 50 of the pre treatment value and thus is not a true representation of longevity of positive treatment effects 1 log l o

mean exceeded the pre treatment breaking point one sem below annual tp mean and longevity of the tp decline was 7 years table 2 fig 1 li decreased as well from a mean of 5 0 to 1 6 mg m2 day 68 over the first 4 year period post al treatment but during subsequent 4 year periods the li rate started to return to pre treatment conditions 2 9 mg m2 day table 2 fig 2 a sd increase of 40 was sustained throughout the available data series from an average of 2 9 m before treatment to an average of 4 1 m at the end of the data series 12 years post treatment 3 1 2 flaten surface tp averaged 33 5 µg l before treatment and decreased to 9 2 8 9 9 5 and 11 0 µg l during subsequent consecutive 4 year periods 4 8 12 and 16 years post treatment meaning the longevity of treatment with respect to surface water tp exceeded the end of this study there was a decrease chl a with concentrations declining from a pre treatment mean of 12 7 µg l to 2 8 3 2 5 4 and 4 7 µg l respectively for 4 8 12 and 16 years post treatment sd significantly improved as well increasing from a pre treatment mean of 2 9 m to 6 3 6 4 4 8 and 5 5 m during 4 8 12 and 16 years post treatment due to continued improvement of all nutrient related water quality variables fig 3 throughout the duration of monitoring treatment longevity could not be calculated but was instead estimated using lpeq to 37 years huser et al 2016b li

was observed mean 43 0 µg l table 2 fig 6 however due to other management efforts such as freshwater dilution and hypolimnetic aeration during the 16 and 20 years post treatment periods tp decreased again and was lower than pre treatment conditions sd did increased with 59 and 41 at the first and second 4 year period post al treatment respectively at years 9 12 post treatment sd had decreased to

treatment mean of 53 6 µg l to 16 4 µg l and tp decreased from a mean 97 5 µg l to 46 5 µg l 4 8 and 12 years post treatment table 2 fig 8 longevity using the post treatment linear increase in surface water tp was estimated to be 21 years fig 8 3 2 2 malmsjön surface water tp concentrations decreased by over 50 in the three post al treatment periods 4 8 and 12 years post treatment the entire dataset pre treatment tp averaged 96 5 µg l and was 43 8 µg l at 12 years post treatment table 2 fig 9 longevity using the linear increase in surface tp after treatment was estimated to be 20 years no other water quality data were available for malmsjön 3 3 factors influencing longevity of al treatment principal components analysis pca including factors in table 1 was used to determine factors driving longevity and explained 79 of the variation in the data set with two components longevity was positively correlated to osgood index suggesting that deeper lakes dimictic have higher longevity than small polymictic lakes the analysis also showed that larger al doses were correlated with greater longevity al pal was negatively correlated to longevity meaning that poor binding efficiency i e high al pal results in lower longevity finally wa la also had a negative correlation to longevity suggesting that lakes with greater watershed area relative to lake area have shorter longevities fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 water quality response to al treatment 4 1 1 dimictic lakes three dimictic lakes lejondalssjön trekanten and flaten were historically monitored at a level required determining the effect of al treatment on surface water quality the data series from these lakes included monthly may september measurements of chl a sd and tp for both surface water and depth intervals covering the vertical water profile except for lejondalssjön which lacked pre treatment chl a data this provided the possibility to include within year may to august variation when studying historical trends in surface water quality vertical profiles with samples taken from different water depths enabled calculation of historical internal loading rates which are generally a better indicator of the effects of al treatment however this direct quantification of internal loading is only applicable to dimictic lakes where the lake remains stratified and hypolimnion remains stable throughout the growing season 4 1 1 1 lejondalssjön internal loading rates decreased 68 during the first 4 year period post al treatment during the following 4 year post treatment periods however internal loading gradually returned to levels not different to pre treatment conditions table 2 fig 1 2 this is likely due to a combination of factors the high amount of legacy mobile sediment p remaining after al treatment agstam norlin et al 2020 table 1 likely overwhelmed the al treatment as was the case for numerous historical treatments where al doses were added that were inadequate to bind the entire excess mobile p pool huser et al 2016b welch and cooke 1999 even though li improved substantially after treatment at least initially surface water tp only decreased by 29 during the first 4 year period this can likely be explained by ongoing excess external p inputs limited treatment longevity has been seen elsewhere when external loading was not reduced adequately or inadequate al doses were used egemose et al 2011 garrison and knauer 1984 huser et al 2011 huser et al 2016b james et al 1991 mehner et al 2008 thus the limited treatment longevity in lejondalssjön is likely explained by a combination of continued excess external loading and the low al dose 25 g m2 added dose calculation methods based on other variables besides sediment p were common before 2000 for lejondalssjön al dose was calculated based on the internal p loading rate kennedy et al 1987 one problem with this approach is that it only accounts for sediment p release during one year even though the sediment often contains enough mobile p to support many years of internal loading without looking at sediment p content it is impossible to determine how much mobile p exists in the sediment and thus underdosing of al is a likely result kuster et al 2020 4 1 1 2 flaten when this lake was treated in 2000 the understanding of al dosing had improved substantially and was based on the available pool of mobile p labile organic p p bound to fe and loosely sorbed porewater p in the lake sediment rydin 2000 the mean dose of al across the lake was 61 g m2 schütz et al 2017 however dose was adjusted higher or lower depending on the amount of mobile sediment p in different locations the application technique employed was also different compared to most al treatments a combination of sediment injection and hypolimnetic water application was used where approximately a fourth of the al dose was applied to the water and the rest injected into the sediment surface water tp concentrations decreased by over 60 due to al treatment and this decrease was sustained through the end of the data series table 2 fig 3 4 chl a had a similar response and remain reduced throughout the study period sd increased more than two fold which also was sustained through the end of the data series 4 1 1 3 trekanten the most recent treatment presented in this study was performed in 2011 in trekanten where a similar dose to that used in flaten was applied 60 g m2 however the application technique differed slightly and only sediment injection was used i e no water application as with flaten the al dose was determined from the amount of mobile p in the sediment the water quality data covered only two 4 year periods post treatment i e 8 years and showed a twofold decrease of tp and chl a throughout the measurement period table 2 fig 5 because internal loading rates decreased by nearly 100 but the lake water still has a tp concentration of nearly 25 µg l it seems likely that external sources of p are still elevated this may to some extent be due to sewage water pipes that had been incorrectly connected to storm water runoff pipes between 2006 and 2013 unfortunately contributing excess external p load during these years the excess external loading does not seem to have had an effect on internal loading fig 6 but if not controlled it is likely internal loading will return huser et al 2011 while sd did not initially improve post treatment there was an increasing trend from 7 during the first 4 year period to 20 increase at the end of the data set 5 8 years similar delayed effects have been seen after al treatment in a number of us lakes huser et al 2011 the lack of immediate response in sd does not seem to be controlled by algal presence because chl a decreased by 50 this suggests a number of alternatives e g sediment resuspension due to winds or benthic feeding fish causing sediment mixing bioturbation turbid storm water inflows or increasing water color total dissolved organic carbon that has been shown to be occurring in boreal regions across sweden and elsewhere de wit et al 2016 huser et al 2012 monteith et al 2007 unfortunately the lack of data did not allow us to explore any of these possible effects 4 1 1 4 bagarsjön whereas the previously described dimictic lakes were monitored in enough detail to calculate historical trends for li data for bagarsjön only included surface water tp and sd at one occasion per year august thus it was not possible to calculate li and within year variation seasonal mean could not be included in the analysis however the effect of al treatment on surface water tp was clear for the initial 4 year period fig 7 surface water tp began to increase after treatment but decreased again during the last two 4 year periods post treatment from 2009 this decrease is likely a result of another separate management action starting in 2009 when an aeration pump was installed in order to keep hypolimnetic water oxygenated there was no clear change in sd after 6 years post al treatment including after aeration started 4 1 2 polymictic lakes because polymictic lakes are generally shallow and well or partially mixed the lack of a well defined hypolimnion makes it is difficult to calculate internal loading rates dynamic modeling would be needed in such cases but monitoring of inflows and outflows was not conducted or data available were too sparse to use dynamic or even simple mass balance models surface water quality trends however could be analyzed and used to estimate treatment effect as has been done in previous studies huser et al 2016b welch and cooke 1999 4 1 2 1 långsjön historical water chemical data for tp sd and chl a together with water profile measurements of tp were available because the lake is polymictic often no accumulation of tp occurs in the bottom water which limits the possibility to estimate li however there was a positive effect for all measured parameters for all 12 years of post treatment data with all variables improving by 50 table 2 fig 8 it should be noted that other management actions including freshwater dilution were performed simultaneously to al treatment these actions will of course improve water quality due to dilution of nutrients in the lake external loading remains elevated however table 2 and will likely overwhelm the effects of al treatment in the future see longevity section below 4 1 2 2 malmsjön available water chemical data included surface water tp concentrations from single samples taken in august each year the lack of water column profile measurements of tp precluded calculation of internal loading making quantification of the direct effect of al treatment impossible despite the limited data available the effect of al treatment on surface water tp was clear for the complete data record surface water tp started to increase after treatment table 2 fig 9 and tp was estimated to return to pre treatment levels after 20 years 4 2 al treatment longevity in polymictic and dimictic lakes if external p sources are reduced sufficiently and al is added at a dose necessary to inactivate the entire legacy sediment p pool treatment longevity would theoretically be infinite once p is bound to al it is considered permanently inactivated welch and cooke 1999 and the sediment layer with elevated aluminum bound p will over time be buried by new sediment for most lakes discussed herein however external loading remains elevated in some cases substantially i e malmsjön and långsjön table 2 in these cases estimates of longevity are mainly a factor of how much external loading has been reduced with al dosing and treatment methods that affect how much al was added relative to legacy sediment p kuster et al 2020 and binding efficiency between al and p agstam norlin et al 2020 huser 2012 having a smaller effect 4 2 1 dimictic lakes nutrient cycling in flaten is mainly controlled by in lake processes rather than external sources due to the low wa la ratio 6 4 and low intensity of land use in the watershed further the al dose was relatively high mean 61 g m2 and mostly applied directly into the sediment rather than to the water column which likely increased binding efficiency mean 9 0 table 1 agstam norlin et al 2020 given that no increase has been detected for li or surface water tp after al treatment longevity in this case may be infinite the lpeq estimated treatment longevity in flaten was 37 years i e surface water tp increases to 50 of pre treatment which is above the mean treatment longevity 21 years for dimictic lakes huser et al 2016b however treatment longevity will likely be substantially longer than predicted using lpeq given no significant increase in li or surface water tp has been detected to date the treatment of trekanten was in many ways similar to the situation in flaten with an even lower wa la 4 3 similar sediment binding efficiency mean al pal 10 7 agstam norlin et al 2020 and a relatively high al dose mean 60 g m2 injected exclusively into the sediment because water quality was still improved with no decline throughout the measurement period a determination of total longevity was not possible with an lpeq estimated treatment longevity of 47 years it is possible that total longevity e g the time it takes for surface water tp to reach pre treatment levels may be a century or longer the treatment of bagarsjön differed from the previous two cases al was applied exclusively to the water column resulting in a lower binding efficiency mean al pal 16 0 agstam norlin et al 2020 additionally nutrient cycling and availability is likely controlled mostly by external sources because the lake has a relatively small area compared to the watershed wa la 22 5 these two factors likely decreased longevity 14 years which is lower than what would be predicted for an average dimictic lake huser et al 2016b similarly lejondalssjön also had a shorter than expected longevity 7 years which can be explained by other factors namely a low dose 25 g al m2 calculated using outdated methods applied to the water column together with moderately high binding efficiency mean al pal 11 4 4 2 2 polymictic lakes the longevity of the långsjön treatment was estimated to be 20 years using linear increase and extrapolation fig 8 of tp this is above the previously reported al treatment longevity of polymictic lakes mean 5 7 years according to huser et al 2016b the much longer predicted longevity can partly be explained by the relatively low wa la 8 4 meaning that in lake processes are likely more important than external sources for nutrient cycling långsjön was treated with a relatively high al dose mean 60 g m2 directly applied to the sediment which led to a moderately high binding efficiency mean al pal 12 9 further another restoration effort was simultaneously performed using freshwater dilution 30 l s since 2002 likely increasing longevity treatment longevity for malmsjön which was estimated at 20 years using the linear increase in surface water tp after treatment fig 9 was well over the typical range for polymictic lakes huser et al 2016b similar to långsjön direct sediment al application was done with a relatively high dose 60 g m2 binding efficiency mean al pal 14 6 and the wa la 13 2 were moderate in comparison to the other study lakes the generally shorter longevity in shallow polymictic lakes is not solely due to lake characteristics but because historically these types of lakes usually received lower al doses which per se results in short longevity because långsjön and malmsjön received relatively high al doses calculated using the mobile sediment p pool applied directly into the sediment increasing binding efficiency longevity exceeded expectations compared to earlier treatments agstam norlin et al 2020 huser et al 2016b 4 2 2 factors influencing al treatment longevity in this study we showed that observed factors generally controlling longevity for the most part follow current understanding in the literature al dose wa la and osgood index i e polymictic versus dimictic lakes drove longevity for the study lake similar to previous conclusions from huser et al al 2016b where 114 lakes were analyzed for factors controlling longevity and 82 of the variation in longevity was explained by wa la al dose and osgood index this is also supported by pca analysis of the study lakes fig 10 where a higher osgood index i e a greater chance for stratification was positively related to longevity and wa la ratios were negatively correlated al dose had a weak positive correlation to longevity possibly explained by the similarity of dose across the study lakes table 1 a new factor al pal ratios was also shown to control longevity with greater ratios i e lower binding efficiency being negatively correlated to longevity of treatment this is plausible as a lower binding efficiency means that less sediment p will be bound per unit al added 4 3 recommendations for assessing li with water quality monitoring the duration and intensity of lake water quality monitoring before and after al treatment constrains the evaluation of effectiveness and longevity in many situations it may not be sufficient to only measure changes in surface water nutrient related parameters such as sd chl a and tp in the lake this is because other restoration efforts may be used simultaneously and or external loading may remain high potentially masking the effect of al or other treatments designed to reduce internal phosphorus loading three dimictic lakes in this study were monitored in a sufficient manner to determine changes to li associated with al treatment lejondalssjön flaten and trekanten monthly water profile measurements of tp with multiple samples collected through the vertical water profile and temperature every meter made it possible to calculate the volume of the hypolimnion and the mass of tp in hypolimnetic water and follow the increase throughout the growing season when lake was stratified nürnberg 2009 higher resolution monitoring is likely needed in polymictic systems as in huser et al 2011 where biweekly observations were used to assess li this is due to the fact that internal loading events are likely shorter i e periodic stratification and or high ph events the polymictic långsjön was monitored monthly with vertical water chemical profiles and temperature at least every meter however assessing li using the same methods as for dimictic lakes was not possible due to the lack of stabile stratification during the growing season thus in polymictic shallow lakes monitoring of flow and nutrient concentrations is needed in the inlets as well so that external and internal loading can be differentiated further to assess li accurately it will generally be necessary to use dynamic modeling approaches including spatially representative information on sediment p forms and potential flux with data series covering pre and post periods of al treatment 5 conclusions an al dose adequate to bind legacy sediment p and appropriate treatment methods depending on lake morphological characteristics are crucial for sustainable restoration of surface water quality using al treatment al dose needs to be large enough to inactivate the entire pool of excess mobile p in the lake sediment which drives the long term potential for internal loading external load reduction is also important as continued excess p loading will eventually overwhelm any measure designed to reduce sediment p release as we showed in this study based on available data the positive effects from al treatment in two lakes flaten and trekanten are likely to last a century or longer on the other hand lakes with high levels of excess external loading had or will have shorter treatment longevity ranging from 7 to 21 years in addition elevated external loading will limit the positive effects of reduced internal loading in lejondalssjön internal loading was reduced substantially after al treatment before the treatment was overwhelmed by new p but surface water tp decreased by a much smaller amount due to continued elevated external loading assuming adequate reduction of external loads al dose becomes the most important factor for restoration success newer methods based on sediment p have been developed and have led to substantially greater treatment longevities primarily due to greater al doses being added however care should be taken with al doses added during one treatment as high single treatment doses decrease the overall efficiency of al treatment as was seen in malmsjön and can limit the amount of sediment p that is inactivated per unit al added doses should be split into smaller sub treatments to improve binding efficiency and increase the amount of p inactivated per unit al added finally al treatment success was based in most cases on surface water quality improvement in this study however the main goal of al treatment is to reduce p release from sediment we attempted to evaluate reduction in internal loading for all lakes but too often adequate data to do this were lacking in cases where variables such as tp chl a and sd have unexpected responses it is important to be able to evaluate whether these responses are due to internal external or both types of loading proper monitoring both before and after treatment is a necessary requirement to be able to evaluate and optimize methods to reduce p loading and eutrophication in

16941,the recent advancement in low temperature anaerobic processes shows a great promise for realizing low energy cost sustainable mainstream wastewater treatment however the considerable loss of the dissolved methane from anaerobically treated low strength wastewater significantly compromises the energy potential of the anaerobic processes and poses an environmental risk in this review the promises and challenges of existing and emerging technologies for dissolved methane management are examined its removal recovery and on site reuse it begins by describing the working principles of gas stripping and biological oxidation for methane removal membrane contactors and vacuum degassers for methane recovery and on site biological conversion of dissolved methane into electricity or value added biochemicals as direct energy sources or energy compensating substances a comparative assessment of these technologies in the three categories is presented based on methane treating efficiency energy production potential applicability and scalability finally current research needs and future perspectives are highlighted to advance the future development of an economically and technically sustainable methane management technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic treatment dissolved methane low strength wastewater recovery valorization 1 introduction the remarkable advances in wastewater treatment technologies in the past century have made vast contributions to the improvement of public health in particular the activated sludge is the most widely used biological process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide as it effectively removes not only biodegradable organic matter up to 95 but also nutrients in further engineered systems despite the indispensability to the modern life wastewater treatment is an energy intensive process its annual energy consumption is estimated to be approximately 4 of the total electrical energy demand in the u s usepa 2010 and up to 2 5 1010 kwh and 1 1011 kwh of electric energy are annually consumed in europe and china respectively ganora et al 2019 smith et al 2016 usepa 2010 yan et al 2017 the ever more stringent discharge standard and treatment regulations on biosolids only further increase the energy cost in wastewater treatment rothausen and conway 2011 smith and liu 2017 usepa 2010 also the large fossil fuel dependency of energy input for wwtps directly impacts on the greenhouse gas emission hao et al 2015 hence searching for effective strategies to improve the energy balance of wwtps is of paramount importance biodegradable organics in domestic wastewater possess high energy potential to offset the energy consumption for treating wastewater if recovered or reused maktabifard et al 2018 mccarty et al 2011 in conventional activated sludge processes almost half of the energy input is expensed for aeration to treat biodegradable organics mccarty et al 2011 which otherwise can be potential sources for energy production alternatively mainstream anaerobic treatment of low strength domestic wastewater has been receiving growing attentions as the anaerobic treatment does not require aeration allows for producing methane as an energy source and reduces sludge production mccarty et al 2011 however conventional anaerobic treatment processes typically require a mesophilic 30 38 c or thermophilic 45 60 c condition to maintain the activity of microbes for anaerobic biodegradation and hence anaerobic dilute wastewater treatment is not stable in temperate areas resulting in a relatively poor effluent quality as such the application of anaerobic treatment is mostly limited to the side stream treatment process the technological advancement during the last two decades has led to the successful implementation of full scale anaerobic systems such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors in sub tropical regions at ambient temperatures 20 30 c lier et al 2010 furthermore the implementation of anaerobic treatment processes in even lower temperatures 20 c has been proven applicable in lab scale and pilot scale studies martinez sosa et al 2011 mckeown et al 2012 petropoulos et al 2017 smith et al 2013 smith et al 2015 demonstrating the great potential of mainstream anaerobic treatment processes as an energy neutral or even energy producing process in temperate regions lier et al 2010 yet such a promise can be realized only if methane is efficiently produced and harvested for energy production crone et al 2016 mccarty et al 2011 wan et al 2016 methane has a non negligible solubility in water at ambient temperature e g 18 6 g m3 30 c though it is commonly treated as a poorly soluble gas the release of dissolved methane to the ambient is not only a loss of energy potential but also an eminent emission source of the potent greenhouse gas in many anaerobic bioreactors their effluents anaerobic effluent hereafter are typically supersaturated with methane crone et al 2016 pauss et al 1990 smith et al 2015 yeo et al 2015 the saturation index the ratio of the actual dissolved methane concentration to the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration typically ranges from 1 0 to 2 5 in uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr but it can reach up to 4 at a very low temperature 3 c henares et al 2018 smith et al 2015 a significantly large fraction of produced methane exists as the dissolved form when low strength wastewater is treated bandara et al 2011 luo et al 2014 theoretically 45 of total produced methane from low strength wastewater ends up as dissolved methane in anaerobic effluents at 30 c liu et al 2014 in many experimental studies supersaturated dissolved methane in effluents accounts for more than 40 of total produced methane at 25 c and the fraction becomes even higher at a lower treatment temperature due to the increased methane solubility bandara et al 2011 lim et al 2019 pauss et al 1990 fig 1 summarizes the mass fractions of dissolved methane to the total produced methane from anaerobic bioreactors in the literature it can be observed that the dissolved methane fraction in general increases with a lower strength of treated wastewater and at a lower operating temperature clearly the dissolved methane accounts for a large fraction of the total methane over a wide range of temperature in particular when the cod concentration is 600 mg l therefore dissolved methane in anaerobic effluents is a critical concern for the implementation of mainstream anaerobic treatment processes for low strength wastewaters crone et al 2016 liu et al 2014 mccarty et al 2011 to manage the dissolved methane a number of technological approaches have been practiced and developed ranging from the conventional gas stripping to the relatively recent processes including anaerobic methane oxidation anmo process and membrane contactors mcs details of these specific processes can be referred to the existing excellent reviews centeno mora and chernicharo 2020 crone et al 2016 heile et al 2017 strong et al 2015 wang et al 2017 due to the differences in working mechanism each process reserves unique strengths and weaknesses as well as suitable working conditions for achieving an efficient removal recovery or reuse of dissolved methane while the existing reviews mainly focus on specific technologies up to our knowledge a critical assessment of the efficacy or energetics relative to other technologies of managing dissolved methane is currently lacking in the literature in particular under the framework of mainstream anaerobic wastewater treatment at relatively low temperatures which is the central focus of dissolved methane management the suitability of each process to specific environments and cost effectiveness relative to other technologies still remain ambiguous the present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing and emerging technologies of managing the dissolved methane and comparative assessment of their efficacy and suitability this review categorizes these technologies into three approaches of the dissolved methane management removal recovery and on site reuse we refer to methane removal as the removal of dissolved methane without utilizing it for other applications methane recovery as collecting dissolved methane in the form of gaseous methane methane reuse as the direct conversion of dissolved methane to other forms of energy source the review begins with delineating the methane separation mechanisms of the technologies process suitability and challenges are then discussed after which comparative assessment of the technological performances is presented finally current research needs as well as future perspectives for the technological implementation are highlighted 2 technologies for removing dissolved methane 2 1 gas stripping gas stripping is commonly practiced for the removal of toxic volatile organic compounds from various water sources such as trihalomethane from drinking water dave 2019 as well as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide h2s from wastewater heile et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 gas stripping processes are conducted in either a gas in liquid or liquid in gas mode in the gas in liquid mode e g tray aerator diffused aeration and bubble column discrete gas bubbles are distributed in a continuous aqueous phase while in the liquid in gas system e g packed tower and spray towers water droplets are exposed to a continuous gas phase heile et al 2017 these processes intend to generate large gas liquid interfacial areas to promote the transfer of the dissolved gasses from the liquid to gas phase despite the effectiveness and ease of operation gas stripping has rarely been used for recovering or removing the dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents glória et al 2016 hartley and lant 2006 the highly diluted methane containing gas e g 6 v v methane in the waste gas glória et al 2016 does not allow for cost effective upgrade of the gas nor for flaring a direct discharge of waste gas not only increases the greenhouse gas emission but a large air flow to ensure the methane concentration below the lower explosion limit 5 v v methane also makes the process energy intensive additionally operational issues such as foaming and flooding may occur during the aeration even with these drawbacks the process simplicity makes the gas stripping suitable when removal of methane is necessary but the low concentration of dissolved methane does not economically justify the recovery or reuse and no stringent regulation for methane emission is imposed shen et al 2015 2 2 biological oxidation one of the simplest ways to remove dissolved methane is oxidizing methane into carbon dioxide microbiologically methanotrophic bacteria utilize methane as the primary electron donor for metabolism which allows for dissolved methane removal by engineering bioreactors hanson and hanson 1996 for instance activated sludge processes effectively oxidized dissolved methane with 80 biological conversion and the rest was stripped to the atmosphere daelman et al 2012 biofiltration and biofilm reactors were also developed to oxidize dissolved methane and thus avoid its release to the atmosphere gupta and goel 2019 hatamoto et al 2010 hatamoto et al reported methane removal as high as 95 with a methane oxidation rate of 0 2 kg ch4 m3 d only at hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 h with a down flow hanging sponge bioreactor hatamoto et al 2010 aerobic methane oxidation is a suitable approach for dissolved methane control although the methanotrophic oxidation of dissolved methane requires aeration the process exerts a significantly lower energy consumption than gas stripping in comparison with gas stripping biological oxidation is also more suitable to treat the wastewater containing foaming induced substances such as surfactants because these substances can be degraded in the aerobic processes palmer and hatley 2018 3 technologies for recovering dissolved methane due to the modularity compactness and reliability membrane based separation processes have been widely implemented for water and wastewater treatment yusuf et al 2020 among them membrane contactors mcs have recently been explored for dissolved methane recovery from wastewater streams in mc either porous or nonporous a hydrophobic membrane is placed between two different phase streams the feed containing target compounds and the permeate stream harvesting the target compounds polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polypropylene pp and polydimethylsiloxane pdms are among the most common materials used for the hydrophobic membrane fabrication enabled by the non wetting property the membrane prevents any mixing or dispersion of the feed and permeate streams and the chemical potential difference of target compounds such as methane generated by the difference of temperature concentration pressure and or solubility across the membrane enables the transport of the compounds through the membrane as the feed is of a liquid phase e g anaerobic effluent the permeate stream can either be liquid liquid liquid mc or gas liquid gas mc for a high rate of target compound extraction a large membrane area is essential in mcs hollow fiber membrane hfm modules which provide a large membrane area per volume up to thousands of m2 m3 are most widely used for mcs fig 2 a these compact modules also grant a substantially higher contact area for methane transfer in comparison with conventional bubble columns or packed towers and alleviate operating issues such as foaming crone et al 2016 heile et al 2017 3 1 liquid gas membrane contactors for dissolved methane recovery two types of liquid gas mcs have been mainly investigated in the past decade fig 2b c a gas flow sweep gas mc or sgmc is continuously introduced or vacuum is applied vacuum mc or vmc as a permeate stream to maintain the low methane concentration in that stream thereby creating the driving force for feed to permeate methane flow across the membrane which can be either porous fig 2e or nonporous fig 2f table 1 summarizes the recent studies which used liquid gas mcs sgmc vmc or combination of both for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents both operation modes can achieve a high methane recovery efficiency defined as the ratio of the mass of recovered dissolved methane to that of total dissolved methane in the former the sweep gas pressure is much lower than that required for the conventional degassing units e g bubble column or tray aerator and thus its energy consumption is also comparatively lower nevertheless like the gas stripping process the use of sweep gas produces a highly diluted biogas typically lower than 1 v v methane table 1 such a low grade biogas does not meet the minimum limit 30 v v for combined heat and power chp systems and requires a downstream process to increase the methane content kaparaju and rintala 2013 sgmc exhibits the trade off between the methane recovery efficiency and the methane fraction in the recovered biogas a higher methane recovery efficiency can be achieved by reducing the feed flow rate as the increased residence time of feed in the membrane module enables methane transfer for a longer time period cookney et al 2012 jiménez robles et al 2020 however a reduced feed flow rate leads to a lower mass transfer coefficient of methane in the feed and consequently results in a lower methane flux mass per area and time this trade off relation was demonstrated in recent studies jiménez robles et al 2020 mcleod et al 2016 where the methane fraction in biogas declined quickly with the increase of methane recovery efficiency and vice versa for instance biogas containing 30 v v methane required for chp was recovered at the expense of a methane recovery efficiency of 80 mcleod et al 2016 as such when near complete methane recovery is aimed multi stage sgmc operation may be necessary in vmc while the methane is not diluted by any carrier gas a high vacuum applied in the permeate can induce a considerable water vapor flow across the membrane abdallah et al 2014 cao et al 2020 water vapor is orders of magnitude more permeable than methane in some commonly used polymer membranes crone et al 2016 metz et al 2005 the transmembrane water vapor flow is rarely discussed in the literature of dissolved methane recovery but a recent study that applied vmc towards effluent from uasb reactors reported a substantial water loss rate i e 50 ml day out of the feed volume rate of 700 ml day luo et al 2014 while the process was aimed for co2 removal from the uasb effluent water vapor accounted for 95 v v of the total desorbed gas in addition because of the extracted water vapor or other gas impurities a similar trade off relation between methane recovery efficiency and methane fraction in biogas was also observed sanchis perucho et al 2020 3 2 liquid liquid membrane contactors the significant dilution of methane by the presence of sweep gas or water vapor reduces the recovered biogas quality and demands high cost for its purification before the biogas utilization to minimize the dilution li et al proposed the solvent based membrane contactor smc as a kind of liquid liquid mc in which a non volatile nonpolar organic solvent that has a high methane solubility is employed as the permeate stream fig 2d li et al 2019b across an omniphobic porous membrane wetting resistant to both water and organic liquids fig 2g that is placed between the feed anaerobic effluent and permeate organic solvent dissolved methane in the feed is extracted into the permeate driven by the solubility difference methane recovery efficiencies of 90 at a wide range of temperature 15 c 35 c were demonstrated in addition the use of nonpolar organic solvent as the permeate effectively precludes water vapor flows which can significantly reduce the downstream purification cost such as dehydration for the acquired biogas in their follow up study using anaerobically treated food leachate as feed li et al 2020 a negligible membrane fouling was observed attributed to the absence of the transmembrane water vapor flow while retaining a virtually identical methane recovery efficiency 92 to that from methane rich deionized water as feed nevertheless compared to liquid gas mcs an extra downstream degassing process is required to release the recovered methane from the methane rich permeate stream and regenerate the permeate stream for further circulation while in principle the desorbed biogas would be free from water or the organic solvent producing methane rich biogas has yet to be demonstrated additionally membrane modules of large area omniphobic membranes are not commercially available and long term wetting resistance of the membranes against organic solvents would need to be guaranteed 3 3 limiting parameters on dissolved methane recovery by mcs impact of operating conditions the methane fluxes and recovery efficiencies are directly dependent on various operating conditions including flow mode feed flow velocity membrane types and membrane fouling cookney et al 2016 henares et al 2017 henares et al 2016 generally feed i e anaerobic effluent flowing through the lumen side of the hfm module leads to a higher mass transfer coefficient and therefore a higher methane flux but this flow mode may cause a clogging of lumen channel when the treated effluent contains suspended solids of high concentrations e g egsb or uasb effluent henares et al 2016 conversely a feed flow in the shell side alleviates the fiber clogging but the lower mass transfer coefficient generally results in a lower methane flux the type of membranes either porous or nonporous strongly affects the tendency of membrane wetting a porous membrane poses a negligible resistance for methane transfer across the membrane in comparison with that through the nonporous membrane however if a pore wetting occurs the percolated feed liquid in the membrane pores becomes stagnant and exerts a high transfer resistance for methane henares et al 2016 mavroudi et al 2006 wang et al 2005 likewise membranes with a higher wetting resistance exhibited higher methane fluxes as an increased hydrophobicity prevents pore wetting and minimizes the methane transfer resistance across the membrane wongchitphimon et al 2017 for nonporous membranes used in mcs fig 2c f polymeric materials that are dense but highly gas permeable such as pdms or polyurethane pu are commonly used bandara et al 2011 cookney et al 2012 the nonporous nature does not incur a penetration of liquid and only allows gas species into the membrane however the methane transfer resistance across a nonporous membrane can be several orders of magnitude higher than that of porous membranes crone et al 2016 membranes in mc processes are prone to fouling by commonly found organic foulants including humic like substances proteins and polysaccharides in anaerobic effluents primarily via hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions membrane fouling would not only reduce the methane flux but it can also cause membrane wetting choudhury et al 2019 a recent study further found that the membrane fouling in mcs is aggravated by water vapor flows across the membrane li et al 2020 it was suggested that the convective water flow toward the membrane surface facilitates foulants accumulation on the membrane surface these observations illustrate that deterring water flow would be necessary for an effective fouling control impact of impurities on recovered biogas in addition to dissolved methane anaerobic effluents contain various compounds that readily transfer into the biogas the composition of biogas recovered by mcs can be significantly different from that found in the headspace of anaerobic bioreactors 30 40 v v co2 water vapor 3 7 v v 1 v v h2s trace amounts of nh3 and siloxane deng and hägg 2010 poloncarzova et al 2011 particularly in mcs co2 and water vapor can be major diluents of methane in the acquired biogas which may also compromise the energy production efficacy e g chp also h2s even at a low concentration in biogas adversely impacts the quality of combustion emissions because h2s is oxidized to acidic sulfur dioxide during the combustion which can result in a corrosion of combustion engine components more frequent oil changes and increased maintenance cost the maximum h2s concentration in biogas for internal combustion engines is typically limited to 200 500 ppm fortuny et al 2011 dissolved co2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid bicarbonate and carbonate ions and fractions of these species are strongly influenced by ph snoeyink and jenkins 1980 fig 3 a shows equilibrium concentrations of dissolved co2 in anaerobically treated low strength wastewaters at 25 c at ph 6 5 8 5 of typical anaerobic effluents the inorganic carbon predominantly exists as bicarbonate hco 3 leaving dissolved co2 as a minor species nevertheless at ph 7 8 and total inorganic carbon of 70 mm as an exemplary condition of typical anaerobic effluent li et al 2020 yu et al 2018 the dissolved co2 concentration is nearly the same as the dissolved methane 2 3 mm assuming a methane saturation index of 1 7 such comparable concentrations can cause a significant dilution of methane by co2 in the biogas recovered by mcs henares et al 2016 luo et al 2014 sethunga et al 2018 for instance in liquid gas mc experiments to remove the dissolved co2 and methane from anaerobic effluent henares et al 2016 even if other gas species are neglected the methane content in the desorbed biogas would be estimated to range from 20 to 50 v v well below that of typical biogas likewise theoretically calculated dissolved h2s concentrations are shown in fig 3b from total sulfide concentrations commonly observed in anaerobically treated low strength wastewaters delgado vela et al 2015 pretel et al 2013 at ph 7 the total sulfide of 3 mm would lead to the dissolved h2s of 1 67 mm comparable to the dissolved methane concentration as h2s is highly soluble in water its concentration in the typical biogas is quite low however biogas desorbed from such an effluent by liquid gas mcs may contain a high concentration of h2s although water vapor is not a major constituent in typical biogas it can significantly dilute the biogas acquired by mcs in particular vmc water fluxes in a vmc employing a porous membrane have been rarely reported but it can be estimated from the data in the literature of vacuum membrane distillation which uses the same principle of vacuum induced evaporation for desalination abu zeid et al 2015 the reported water vapor fluxes at operating temperature of 25 35 c 10 500 mol m 2 h 1 are more than two orders of magnitude higher than the methane flux produced in vmc table 1 abdallah et al 2014 baghel et al 2020 bandini et al 1997 as such when vmc is aimed to produce usable methane not merely removing methane a low energy cost dehydration process needs to be sought li et al 2019b moreover the evaporation of water involves a large latent heat of vaporization which would induce a temperature decrease of the feed solution that makes the methane more soluble 3 4 vacuum degasser vacuum degasser has long been used to remove entrained gasses such as h2s and corrosive oxygen from drilling fluids rehm 2005 applying the vacuum degasser for dissolved methane recovery from anaerobically treated wastewater was investigated recently lee et al 2020 a nozzle fitted three stage vacuum degasser was employed to demonstrate a maximum recovery of approximately 94 the anaerobically treated wastewater was sprayed into vacuum chambers with without packing media to enhance the transfer of the dissolved methane into the gas phase their energy analysis showed that the vacuum degasser could achieve a net energy production of 0 05 0 07 kwh per m3 of effluent while it is promising this value was obtained by assuming a relatively low water vaporization similar to vmc the energy producing potential of vacuum degasser can be drastically compromised by significant water vapor flows which deserves a thorough investigation in future studies a temperature drop due to latent heat loss by water evaporation will also increase the gas solubility and slow down the mass transfer additionally although the mass transfer can be enhanced by generating droplets and or installing packing media additional pumping cost for head elevation is required and the vacuum degasser may require multiple stages and a large footprint to sufficiently increase methane transfer rate 4 technologies for reusing dissolved methane on site 4 1 methane fueled mfc as opposed to the methane recovery that requires extraction purification and storage for its later use directly converting the dissolved methane to other forms of energy or chemicals on site can be a simpler alterative for utilizing dissolved methane as a resource or an energy source microbial fuel cells mfcs are bioelectrochemical systems in which the exoelectrogenic microorganisms capable of transferring electrons extracellularly oxidize the organics and deposit electrons onto the anode for electricity production generally methane is not an ideal substrate for the exoelectrogenic microorganisms to respire at the anode however mfcs using uncultured anaerobic methane oxidizing consortia isolated from oceanic sediment produced electricity from methane as the organic substrate albeit a very low power density 0 65 mw m2 ding et al 2017 the anode was enriched with geobacter a common exoelectrogen found in mfcs and also with anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme that can perform anaerobic oxidation of methane aom via reverse methanogenesis suggesting that these microbial communities simultaneously enable the electron deposition onto the anode yet anme typically form syntrophic consortia with sulfate reducing bacteria in nature isolating them for the application of methane fueled mfcs is challenging however it was recently shown that anme residing in deep sea sediments can be catabolically or anabolically decoupled from sulfate reducing bacteria using soluble artificial electron acceptor scheller et al 2016 provided with artificial electron acceptors 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate the isolated anme efficiently oxidized methane based on the proposed pathway for methane to electricity conversion mcanulty et al demonstrated a substantial electricity production from methane in a two chamber mfc using a genetically engineered archaeal strain fig 4 a mcanulty et al 2017 the methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr enzymes produced by the archaeal efficiently converted methane into acetate which is a more favorable organic substrate than methane for g sulfurreducens and other exoelectrogens on the anode a sludge was added to the anodic chamber as electron shuttles i e substances that can be reversibly reduced and oxidized to promote the extracellular electron transfer the electrons migrated to the cathode are consumed through converting ferricyanide to ferrocyanide in the other chamber to complete the circuit and generate electricity fig 4a the mfc produced a maximum power of 168 9 mw m2 comparable to mfcs fueled by other organics logan et al 2015 and with a high coulombic efficiency 90 10 almost all the electrons extracted from methane generated a current subsequently yamasaki et al determined that the electron shuttle was the rate limiting factor in the methane fueled mfc yamasaki et al 2018 with humic acids added as an electron shuttle the power density was increased 10 fold to a remarkably high level 4700 800 mw m2 30 c while maintaining a high coulombic efficiency 82 3 this experiment proved the critical impact of electron shuttle on boosting the power generation in methane fueled mfcs applications of mfcs for on site reuse of dissolved methane while the conventional two chamber mfc is generally operated in the batch mode or the fed batch mode a single chamber air cathode mfcs operated in a continuous mode 20 c was recently investigated for reusing dissolved methane on site to produce electricity chen and smith 2018 fig 4b the aerobic methanotrophs and geobacter enriched in the anode biofilm along with an enhanced oxygen availability by increasing hrt enabled the consumption of up to 85 dissolved methane and the power density production of 62 0 mw m2 however a rather low coulombic efficiency 17 7 was obtained such a low coulombic efficiency was likely due to the loss of electrons during conversion of methane to intermediate metabolites e g formate and scavenging of the metabolites by competing heterotrophic bacteria developing mfcs working at relatively low temperatures is highly desirable for their integration with the psychrophilic anaerobic processes chen and smith in their follow up study investigated the impact of operation temperature 5 25 c on methane driven single chamber mfcs chen and smith 2019 the removal efficiency of dissolved methane remained relatively stable 53 0 63 6 over the operation temperatures however at 10 c and below the power density drastically dropped to 12 mw m2 10 c from 60 6 mw m2 25 c and the coulombic efficiency was decreased by more than half 3 at 10 c the results verify the critical dependency of power output of mfcs on the temperature through its influence on the activation energy electrolyte conductivity diffusivity electrode potential charge transfer rate and others larrosa guerrero et al 2010 li et al 2013 oliveira et al 2013 in addition the sensitive nature of the microbes makes the mfc performance highly susceptible to fluctuations in these variables limitations of mfcs for the reuse of dissolved methane a high power output from methane fueled mfcs relies on genetically engineered archaeal strains effective electron shuttles and well controlled operation conditions additionally when incorporated with psychrophilic anaerobic treatment processes for mainstream wastewater the compromised power generation at low temperatures must be addressed dai et al 2020 while several novel configurations have been proposed to incorporate mfcs into actual wastewater treatment processes mfcs are currently limited to laboratory scale demonstrations and far from the commercialization stage do et al 2018 the highest power density reported for methane fueled mfcs to date thousands of mw m2 is about four to five orders of magnitude lower than chemical fcs 104 105 w m2 the fluctuations of generated voltage and current as well as the insufficient long term stability also remain major challenges in addition the biofouling and its associated high internal resistance restrain the power generation in mfcs logan et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 thus utilizing mfcs as an alternative to chemical fcs is so far still impractical 4 2 coupling oxidation of dissolved methane to denitrification as the anaerobic treatment removes organic carbon but not nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus a post treatment process is usually required to enhance the nutrient removal and meet the stringent discharge criteria lee et al 2018 coagulant dose can readily control effluent phosphorous but nitrogen removal is very challenging due to the insufficient carbon and electrons in the anaerobically treated effluent hence exogenous carbon sources such as methanol should be added to achieve a target removal of nutrient if this dissolved methane could be used as the carbon and electron source for denitrification the entire treatment process can be performed in a much more cost effective manner than the conventional biological nitrogen removal process e g nitrification and denitrification using exogenous electron donor nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo microbes enable a simultaneous denitrification and the removal of dissolved methane in which the dissolved methane can be oxidized anaerobically using nitrate nitrite as electron acceptors alvarino et al 2019 raghoebarsing et al 2006 nc10 bacteria and anme archaea are two major types of microorganisms that play dominant roles in the anmo process raghoebarsing et al 2006 where nitrate is reduced to nitrite by anme with methane as the electron donor and the nitrite is converted to nitrogen gas by nc10 bacteria using electrons derived from methane oxidation n damo microbes can be integrated with anammox bacteria for side stream wastewater or ammonia rich industrial wastewater treatment fan et al 2020 hu et al 2015 liu et al 2020b luesken et al 2011 shi et al 2013 in this coupled process anammox bacteria compete with n damo bacteria for nitrite reduction to dinitrogen while electron donors are different while aeration costs for the full nitrification can be significantly reduced by coupling n damo with anammox its implementation in the mainstream wastewater treatment process faces several challenges first temperature sensitivities of anammox and n damo microorganisms are not well studied and the metabolism of the microorganisms tends to be suppressed at low temperatures e g 15 c although a recent work reported temperature tolerant annamox and n damo microorganisms at 10 c in a lab scale experiment liu et al 2020a tests in larger settings are required to ensure consistent denitrification performance at temperatures of domestic wastewater often 15 c second anammox and n damo microorganisms are not fast growers like heterotrophic denitrifiers and hence their performance in large scale bioreactors is still questionable last associated with limited information a stable partial nitritation is not easily achieved for low strength wastewater instead coupling aerobic methane oxidation to denitrification has often been found in dilute wastewater studies involving methylomonas methylocystis or methylocystis cao et al 2019 lee et al 2019 lee et al demonstrated that methane oxidation was coupled to denitrification under hypoxic conditions even in an air tight membrane biofilm reactor lee et al 2019 a number of studies also showed that aerobic methanotrophs could couple methane oxidation to nitrate nitrite reduction in syntrophy with diverse denitrifiers under hypoxic conditions alrashed et al 2018 alvarino et al 2019 kits et al 2015 orata et al 2018 tang et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 which are close to the operating conditions of anoxic bioreactors widely used in wwtps 4 3 biological conversion of dissolved methane to value added products dissolved methane can be converted by methanotrophs to cellular compounds or organic substrates that have higher commercial prices than methane including proteins biopolymers methanol and organic acids alsayed et al 2018 lebrero and chandran 2017 strong et al 2015 however harvesting these value added products requires a series of downstream processes to separate and purify the final products from the aqueous medium cuellar and straathof 2020 strong et al 2015 particularly when the yield is low and the final product is very diluted this protocol may not be economically viable given the presence of various complex compounds in wastewaters straathof 2011 instead a cost effective reuse of dissolved methane may be achieved if the conversion products are directly usable on site without requiring downstream separation processes knowles 2005 under this scope the biological conversion of dissolved methane to methanol is more attractive than other biological conversion pathways because methanol is considered as the most ideal carbon source added to wastewater in wwtps for the biological nitrogen or phosphate removal gautam et al 2020 lebrero and chandran 2017 thus biomethanol produced from dissolved methane by methanotrophs can be directly utilized for denitrification su et al 2019 which potentially reduces the external carbon demand and the operational cost of wwtps additionally biomethanol is an ideal organic substrate for mfcs myung et al 2018 conversion of methane to methanol can be carried out by methanotrophs using the enzyme methane monooxygenase mmo to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol duan et al 2011 patel et al 2020 pen et al 2014 however as one kind of intermediates in the methane conversion pathway methanol is readily converted to downstream intermediates or co2 kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 adding enzyme inhibitors such as nh4cl phosphate salt of high concentration is one common approach to prevent the further oxidation of methanol and therefore accumulate the methanol bjorck et al 2018 han et al 2013 lebrero and chandran 2017 tabata and okura 2008 still most studies have reported 70 conversion efficiencies of methane to methanol even after an optimization of inhibitor concentration and hours of cultivation at a mesophilic condition 25 35 c lebrero and chandran 2017 a well controlled inhibition without affecting the long term catalytic activity of methanotrophs is still challenging xin et al 2004 moreover the added inhibitors will increase the downstream treatment cost for their removal e g phosphate discounting the benefit of biomethanol production alternatively ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob also enable the methane to methanol conversion through the catalysis by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo su et al 2019 taher and chandran 2013 unlike mob aob oxidize methane to methanol but does not further oxidize methanol to co2 jones and morita 1983 however aob require an external source of reducing power to ensure continuous methane oxidization using nh2oh as the reducing power source taher and chandran showed that up to 59 9 mg cod l of methanol was produced by aob in a fed batch sequential bioreactor with a mixed nitrifying enrichment culture taher and chandran 2013 despite the enhanced methanol yield the requirement of external reducing power sources makes it difficult to justify this approach for producing profits or reducing operating cost in wastewater treatment instead ammonia that is readily available in anaerobic effluent will be a more practical reducing power source for methanol production but the efficiency is much lower than nh2oh su et al 2019 the methane to methanol conversion process working at low temperatures is crucial to integrating the conversion process with psychrophilic anaerobic treatment processes however the optimum temperature for most strains of both mob and aob ranges from 22 c to 30 c bjorck et al 2018 taher and chandran 2013 and in some cases above 30 c gupta and goel 2019 su et al 2017 in addition the slow growth of mob and aob screening of appropriate strains and optimizing cultivation conditions need to be addressed as such a fundamental understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms involved in the oxidation with mmo is required alsayed et al 2018 last the biomethanol production from real anaerobically treated wastewater needs to be demonstrated to assess the viability of integration of the process with the existing wastewater treatment process 5 perspectives and research needs 5 1 comparison of different dissolved methane management technologies a qualitative comparison of dissolved methane management technologies based on several evaluation metrics is summarized in table 2 currently most of technologies can achieve 90 methane treating efficiency mass fraction of removed recovered reused methane to total dissolved methane at ambient or lower temperatures and even when methane is supersaturated on the other hand coupling oxidation of dissolved methane to denitrification may show a compromised treating efficiency when temperature is lower than 15 c owing to the decreased activity of microorganisms mfcs exhibit somewhat lower treating efficiencies 50 85 at ambient temperature the treating efficiencies of biological conversion processes are lower than 90 even when operated at relatively high temperature 25 c as such methane oxidation denitrification coupling mfcs and biological conversion are rated fair two stars while the other technologies are rated good three stars in the treating efficiency of dissolved methane the dissolved methane concentration in liquid phase corresponding to the lower explosive limit of methane in gas phase 5 v v is 1 4 mg l with the safety factor of 10 it is often practiced in industry to maintain the dissolved methane concentration below 0 14 mg l 15 c before discharge to prevent creating a potentially explosive environment cookney et al 2016 this requirement corresponds to the treating efficiency of 99 when treating a saturated or supersaturated effluent to achieve such a high treating efficiency multiple treating units or a longer hrt might be necessary as gas stripping and biological oxidation do not produce energy and the former process even consumes energy in a large amount for aeration their net energy production potential is rated zero among methane recovery and reuse technologies smc and methane oxidation denitrification coupling have high net energy potential due to the much lower requirement of energy intensive post treatment processes than other technologies and to the high treating efficiency of dissolved methane in comparison mfc and biological conversion have lower treating efficiencies lowering net energy production potential two stars liquid gas mcs also exhibit relatively low net energy production potential owing to the large energy requirement for upgrading the harvested biogas or removing the extracted water vapor two stars in addition to the potential requirement of multiple stages and a large physical footprint compared to membrane systems for achieving high treating recovery efficiencies vacuum degassers likely have the similar issue of a high content of water vapor in the acquired biogas due to the uncertainty of energy consumption estimation and the very limited extent of investigation for dissolved methane recovery it is slightly less rated than liquid gas mcs one and half stars provided with a properly selected and adapted microbial culture biological processes in general are relatively robust to other dissolved compounds however some dissolved compounds such as h2s in the effluent can be very detrimental to a number of microbial organisms that have been utilized for dissolved methane management as for mfc another major concern is the biofouling of cathodes and proton exchange membranes therefore in terms of the process robustness to other dissolved compounds biological oxidation methane oxidation denitrification coupling and biological conversion are rated fair two stars and mfc is rated poor one star fouling is also a persistent problem for liquid gas mcs two stars while the absence of water vapor flow effectively mitigates fouling in smc three stars the application of gas stripping is also limited in some cases if the effluent contains a certain amount of foaming induced substances such as surfactants two stars in contrast dissolved compounds in the wastewater have relatively minor impact on the operation of vacuum degasser three stars for scalability gas stripping biological oxidation liquid gas mcs and vacuum degasser are mature technologies and therefore their implementation in a large scale is straightforward three stars although decent treating efficiencies have been demonstrated by smc and methane oxidation denitrification coupling in bench scale hollow fiber modules with highly wetting resistant omniphobic membranes are still not commercially available one star and the long incubation time of some specific microbes is still a notable hindrance for the large scale application of methane oxidation denitrification coupling two stars mfc and biological conversion still suffer from a number of technical hurdles and their pilot scale demonstrations have yet to be done one star 5 2 improving long term process stability generally speaking biological processes for dissolved methane management exhibit relatively stable performances once the microbes adapt to operating conditions conversely membrane based processes for methane recovery are susceptible to membrane wetting and fouling detrimental to the long term process stability robust wetting resistance of the membrane is essential as fatty acids and surfactants present in anaerobic effluents can accelerate the membrane pore wetting during the methane recovery process chew et al 2017 lee et al 2016 membrane wetting resistance can be increased by grafting or coating low surface energy materials e g fluorosilanes or fluoropolymers onto the membrane surface and or attaining surface textures that feature re entrant structure kota et al 2014 lee et al 2016 tuteja et al 2007 these approaches allow for operation of mcs in contact with low surface tension feed sethunga et al 2018 however the long term effectiveness of those membranes for real wastewater is questionable boo et al 2016 using a nonporous membrane circumvents the pore wetting issue but at the potential expense of compromised methane fluxes henares et al 2018 a promising alternative is to fabricate a composite membrane that comprises a thin nonporous layer for wetting prevention and a porous support layer for low transport resistance and mechanical support sethunga et al 2019a membrane fouling can drastically reduce the methane flux common pretreatment processes such as ultrafiltration or nanofiltration effectively remove the organic foulants however biogas bubbles that form on the membrane surface or filtered particles via heterogeneous nucleation would cause a sizable loss of dissolved methane scardina and edwards 2001 fabricating composite membranes consisting of a hydrophilic layer fouling resistant and the hydrophobic omniphobic porous substrate is an alternative approach and showed great promise in fouling prevention and delay in membrane distillation for desalination huang et al 2017 li et al 2019a xu et al 2019 yang et al 2016 these composite membranes have been rarely tested in mcs for dissolved methane recovery very recently however sethunga et al fabricated a composite membrane by coating a pdms based amphiphilic copolymer onto a membrane consisting a dense pdms layer and a pvdf porous substrate which demonstrated a reduced methane flux decline than the uncoated membrane sethunga et al 2020 further experimental studies to substantiate the effectiveness of the composite membranes as well as relatively simple fabrication processes are warrantied finally the role of water vapor flow in aggravated membrane fouling had long been overlooked in mcs until it was recently investigated li et al 2019b as discussed in section 3 3 the recently proposed smc process that employs non water soluble solvent as permeate stream precluded water vapor flow and showed significantly less fouling li et al 2020 likewise identifying the operation conditions or process configurations that deter the transmembrane water vapor flow while enabling the methane flow would minimize the fouling effectively biofouling of proton exchange membranes pem remains a major hurdle for long term stable operation of mfcs noori et al 2019 a biofilm formed on the pem surface can significantly affect the proton conductivity of the membrane the coulombic efficiency and the maximum power density which results in a compromised energy production xu et al 2012 in a study on dual chamber mfc for instance the power density was reduced by 55 from 1 w m2 at two months of operation to 0 45 w m2 at six months due to the biofouling of the pem miskan et al 2016 moreover biofilms also form on the surface of cathode and further deteriorate the power generation performances of mfcs yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 5 3 minimizing the impurity transfer into the biogas while purification processes including chemical absorption pressure swing adsorption dehydration and membrane based gas separation are available for post treatment of biogas angelidaki et al 2018 biogas of high methane contents obtained by mcs is desired to reduce the post treatment cost the methane content in the biogas can be increased by tuning operation conditions of mcs henares et al 2016 in sgmc for instance it has been shown that poorly soluble gasses i e methane experience a much smaller mass transfer resistance in gas phase sweep gas or much higher resistance in liquid phase feed compared to soluble gasses e g co2 rongwong et al 2017 therefore reduced fluxes of soluble impurity gasses relative to the methane flux are anticipated when operating the mcs at a low sweep gas flow rate or a higher feed flow rate this operation is particularly beneficial to reducing h2s flux as h2s is far more soluble than methane given that even a low concentration of h2s would become a severe issue on the utilization of the harvested biogas several relevant studies also demonstrated that lowering the gas flow rate in sgmc could drastically slow down the transfer of dissolved h2s while its effect on the methane flux was negligible boucif et al 2008 cookney et al 2012 cookney et al 2016 similarly a recent modeling study for smc process suggests that biogas of a significantly higher methane content compared to the typical biogas is attainable by controlling feed to draw flow rate ratios dutta et al 2021 in addition the methane content can be further increased in smc process by employing a permeate solvent that has a high solubility contrast between methane and other gas impurities which has yet to be demonstrated 5 4 assessment of methane removal recovery and reuse in realistic settings most of methane recovery or reuse techniques are still in the phase of lab scale demonstration making it challenging to assess their energy consumption membrane processes and feasibility particularly for biological processes in realistic settings for biological processes of dissolved methane management one of the main challenges is the stability to low temperature as a potential approach psychrotolerant microorganisms can be enriched to given bioprocesses e g mfcs coupling methane oxidation to denitrification and bio conversion bale et al 2019 reino et al 2018 for example some anammox bacteria enriched from wastewater treatment plant sludge were shown to survive at 11 c and maintain their activity during temperature disturbances reino et al 2018 establishing an overcapacity of microorganisms through optimizing reactor structure and operational strategies potentially mitigates the activity loss of microorganisms at low temperatures liu et al 2020a and bioaugmentation using biofilms or bio carriers would be realistic to overcome this challenge such as moving bed biofilm reactors young et al 2017 a pilot scale gas sparged anmbr treating low strength wastewater at seasonally varying temperatures with the capacity of dissolved methane and nutrient recovery was recently commissioned and operated in the u s evans et al 2018 lim et al 2019 the average recovery efficiency of dissolved methane was 79 2 and the maximum h2s removal was 39 with insignificant fractional changes in dissolved co2 however even for mcs that are the closest to large scale implementation most energetics analyses are purely theoretical on the basis of an ideal or incomplete methane recovery process for example in either vmc or smc operation vacuum pumping to extract the dissolved methane from the aqueous feed or organic solvent accounts for a substantial fraction of energy consumption when estimating the power input of vacuum pumping the analyses often consider the methane flow rate only instead of total gas flow rate jiménez robles et al 2020 rongwong et al 2017 as aforementioned there are strong evidences that vmc involves non negligible fluxes of water vapor and co2 ignoring these fluxes would considerably underestimate the energy consumption for smc likewise demonstrating the downstream treatment of organic solvent i e degassing and regeneration with a continuous methane recovery process is a critical element for assessing the technical and economic viabilities however commercial modules of large area omniphobic membrane are still not available in addition the recovered biogas containing impurities may need to be purified prior to energy production but such purification cost is rarely included in most analyses li et al 2019b rongwong et al 2018 6 conclusion this paper presented an overview of existing and emerging technologies for removal recovery or reuse of dissolved methane in anaerobically treated low strength wastewater and comparative assessment of their efficacies suitabilities and challenges although effective methane removal processes essentially have no net energy production potential membrane based recovery processes effectively extract the dissolved methane at a wide temperature range and are probably the most scalable however their net energy production potential would be restricted by the energy consumption to remove gas impurities from the acquired biogas the processes are highly susceptible to fouling and wetting a complete energetics analysis that accounts for recovery to biogas purification and energy production is not available on site reuse biotechnologies directly convert dissolved methane to other forms of energy which can obviate the energy input for methane recovery and its downstream processing and thus show net energy production potential however the drastically reduced conversion efficiency at psychrophilic conditions as well as the limited scalability remains a significant challenge on their applications for mainstream wastewater treatment future research endeavors should be directed to complete large scale demonstration in realistic settings to accurately assess the energy potential of the dissolved methane management technologies critical to realizing an energy neutral or even energy positive mainstream wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest none

16941,the recent advancement in low temperature anaerobic processes shows a great promise for realizing low energy cost sustainable mainstream wastewater treatment however the considerable loss of the dissolved methane from anaerobically treated low strength wastewater significantly compromises the energy potential of the anaerobic processes and poses an environmental risk in this review the promises and challenges of existing and emerging technologies for dissolved methane management are examined its removal recovery and on site reuse it begins by describing the working principles of gas stripping and biological oxidation for methane removal membrane contactors and vacuum degassers for methane recovery and on site biological conversion of dissolved methane into electricity or value added biochemicals as direct energy sources or energy compensating substances a comparative assessment of these technologies in the three categories is presented based on methane treating efficiency energy production potential applicability and scalability finally current research needs and future perspectives are highlighted to advance the future development of an economically and technically sustainable methane management technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic treatment dissolved methane low strength wastewater recovery valorization 1 introduction the remarkable advances in wastewater treatment technologies in the past century have made vast contributions to the improvement of public health in particular the activated sludge is the most widely used biological process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps worldwide as it effectively removes not only biodegradable organic matter up to 95 but also nutrients in further engineered systems despite the indispensability to the modern life wastewater treatment is an energy intensive process its annual energy consumption is estimated to be approximately 4 of the total electrical energy demand in the u s usepa 2010 and up to 2 5 1010 kwh and 1 1011 kwh of electric energy are annually consumed in europe and china respectively ganora et al 2019 smith et al 2016 usepa 2010 yan et al 2017 the ever more stringent discharge standard and treatment regulations on biosolids only further increase the energy cost in wastewater treatment rothausen and conway 2011 smith and liu 2017 usepa 2010 also the large fossil fuel dependency of energy input for wwtps directly impacts on the greenhouse gas emission hao et al 2015 hence searching for effective strategies to improve the energy balance of wwtps is of paramount importance biodegradable organics in domestic wastewater possess high energy potential to offset the energy consumption for treating wastewater if recovered or reused maktabifard et al 2018 mccarty et al 2011 in conventional activated sludge processes almost half of the energy input is expensed for aeration to treat biodegradable organics mccarty et al 2011 which otherwise can be potential sources for energy production alternatively mainstream anaerobic treatment of low strength domestic wastewater has been receiving growing attentions as the anaerobic treatment does not require aeration allows for producing methane as an energy source and reduces sludge production mccarty et al 2011 however conventional anaerobic treatment processes typically require a mesophilic 30 38 c or thermophilic 45 60 c condition to maintain the activity of microbes for anaerobic biodegradation and hence anaerobic dilute wastewater treatment is not stable in temperate areas resulting in a relatively poor effluent quality as such the application of anaerobic treatment is mostly limited to the side stream treatment process the technological advancement during the last two decades has led to the successful implementation of full scale anaerobic systems such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors in sub tropical regions at ambient temperatures 20 30 c lier et al 2010 furthermore the implementation of anaerobic treatment processes in even lower temperatures 20 c has been proven applicable in lab scale and pilot scale studies martinez sosa et al 2011 mckeown et al 2012 petropoulos et al 2017 smith et al 2013 smith et al 2015 demonstrating the great potential of mainstream anaerobic treatment processes as an energy neutral or even energy producing process in temperate regions lier et al 2010 yet such a promise can be realized only if methane is efficiently produced and harvested for energy production crone et al 2016 mccarty et al 2011 wan et al 2016 methane has a non negligible solubility in water at ambient temperature e g 18 6 g m3 30 c though it is commonly treated as a poorly soluble gas the release of dissolved methane to the ambient is not only a loss of energy potential but also an eminent emission source of the potent greenhouse gas in many anaerobic bioreactors their effluents anaerobic effluent hereafter are typically supersaturated with methane crone et al 2016 pauss et al 1990 smith et al 2015 yeo et al 2015 the saturation index the ratio of the actual dissolved methane concentration to the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration typically ranges from 1 0 to 2 5 in uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr but it can reach up to 4 at a very low temperature 3 c henares et al 2018 smith et al 2015 a significantly large fraction of produced methane exists as the dissolved form when low strength wastewater is treated bandara et al 2011 luo et al 2014 theoretically 45 of total produced methane from low strength wastewater ends up as dissolved methane in anaerobic effluents at 30 c liu et al 2014 in many experimental studies supersaturated dissolved methane in effluents accounts for more than 40 of total produced methane at 25 c and the fraction becomes even higher at a lower treatment temperature due to the increased methane solubility bandara et al 2011 lim et al 2019 pauss et al 1990 fig 1 summarizes the mass fractions of dissolved methane to the total produced methane from anaerobic bioreactors in the literature it can be observed that the dissolved methane fraction in general increases with a lower strength of treated wastewater and at a lower operating temperature clearly the dissolved methane accounts for a large fraction of the total methane over a wide range of temperature in particular when the cod concentration is 600 mg l therefore dissolved methane in anaerobic effluents is a critical concern for the implementation of mainstream anaerobic treatment processes for low strength wastewaters crone et al 2016 liu et al 2014 mccarty et al 2011 to manage the dissolved methane a number of technological approaches have been practiced and developed ranging from the conventional gas stripping to the relatively recent processes including anaerobic methane oxidation anmo process and membrane contactors mcs details of these specific processes can be referred to the existing excellent reviews centeno mora and chernicharo 2020 crone et al 2016 heile et al 2017 strong et al 2015 wang et al 2017 due to the differences in working mechanism each process reserves unique strengths and weaknesses as well as suitable working conditions for achieving an efficient removal recovery or reuse of dissolved methane while the existing reviews mainly focus on specific technologies up to our knowledge a critical assessment of the efficacy or energetics relative to other technologies of managing dissolved methane is currently lacking in the literature in particular under the framework of mainstream anaerobic wastewater treatment at relatively low temperatures which is the central focus of dissolved methane management the suitability of each process to specific environments and cost effectiveness relative to other technologies still remain ambiguous the present review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing and emerging technologies of managing the dissolved methane and comparative assessment of their efficacy and suitability this review categorizes these technologies into three approaches of the dissolved methane management removal recovery and on site reuse we refer to methane removal as the removal of dissolved methane without utilizing it for other applications methane recovery as collecting dissolved methane in the form of gaseous methane methane reuse as the direct conversion of dissolved methane to other forms of energy source the review begins with delineating the methane separation mechanisms of the technologies process suitability and challenges are then discussed after which comparative assessment of the technological performances is presented finally current research needs as well as future perspectives for the technological implementation are highlighted 2 technologies for removing dissolved methane 2 1 gas stripping gas stripping is commonly practiced for the removal of toxic volatile organic compounds from various water sources such as trihalomethane from drinking water dave 2019 as well as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide h2s from wastewater heile et al 2017 kinidi et al 2018 gas stripping processes are conducted in either a gas in liquid or liquid in gas mode in the gas in liquid mode e g tray aerator diffused aeration and bubble column discrete gas bubbles are distributed in a continuous aqueous phase while in the liquid in gas system e g packed tower and spray towers water droplets are exposed to a continuous gas phase heile et al 2017 these processes intend to generate large gas liquid interfacial areas to promote the transfer of the dissolved gasses from the liquid to gas phase despite the effectiveness and ease of operation gas stripping has rarely been used for recovering or removing the dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents glória et al 2016 hartley and lant 2006 the highly diluted methane containing gas e g 6 v v methane in the waste gas glória et al 2016 does not allow for cost effective upgrade of the gas nor for flaring a direct discharge of waste gas not only increases the greenhouse gas emission but a large air flow to ensure the methane concentration below the lower explosion limit 5 v v methane also makes the process energy intensive additionally operational issues such as foaming and flooding may occur during the aeration even with these drawbacks the process simplicity makes the gas stripping suitable when removal of methane is necessary but the low concentration of dissolved methane does not economically justify the recovery or reuse and no stringent regulation for methane emission is imposed shen et al 2015 2 2 biological oxidation one of the simplest ways to remove dissolved methane is oxidizing methane into carbon dioxide microbiologically methanotrophic bacteria utilize methane as the primary electron donor for metabolism which allows for dissolved methane removal by engineering bioreactors hanson and hanson 1996 for instance activated sludge processes effectively oxidized dissolved methane with 80 biological conversion and the rest was stripped to the atmosphere daelman et al 2012 biofiltration and biofilm reactors were also developed to oxidize dissolved methane and thus avoid its release to the atmosphere gupta and goel 2019 hatamoto et al 2010 hatamoto et al reported methane removal as high as 95 with a methane oxidation rate of 0 2 kg ch4 m3 d only at hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 h with a down flow hanging sponge bioreactor hatamoto et al 2010 aerobic methane oxidation is a suitable approach for dissolved methane control although the methanotrophic oxidation of dissolved methane requires aeration the process exerts a significantly lower energy consumption than gas stripping in comparison with gas stripping biological oxidation is also more suitable to treat the wastewater containing foaming induced substances such as surfactants because these substances can be degraded in the aerobic processes palmer and hatley 2018 3 technologies for recovering dissolved methane due to the modularity compactness and reliability membrane based separation processes have been widely implemented for water and wastewater treatment yusuf et al 2020 among them membrane contactors mcs have recently been explored for dissolved methane recovery from wastewater streams in mc either porous or nonporous a hydrophobic membrane is placed between two different phase streams the feed containing target compounds and the permeate stream harvesting the target compounds polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polypropylene pp and polydimethylsiloxane pdms are among the most common materials used for the hydrophobic membrane fabrication enabled by the non wetting property the membrane prevents any mixing or dispersion of the feed and permeate streams and the chemical potential difference of target compounds such as methane generated by the difference of temperature concentration pressure and or solubility across the membrane enables the transport of the compounds through the membrane as the feed is of a liquid phase e g anaerobic effluent the permeate stream can either be liquid liquid liquid mc or gas liquid gas mc for a high rate of target compound extraction a large membrane area is essential in mcs hollow fiber membrane hfm modules which provide a large membrane area per volume up to thousands of m2 m3 are most widely used for mcs fig 2 a these compact modules also grant a substantially higher contact area for methane transfer in comparison with conventional bubble columns or packed towers and alleviate operating issues such as foaming crone et al 2016 heile et al 2017 3 1 liquid gas membrane contactors for dissolved methane recovery two types of liquid gas mcs have been mainly investigated in the past decade fig 2b c a gas flow sweep gas mc or sgmc is continuously introduced or vacuum is applied vacuum mc or vmc as a permeate stream to maintain the low methane concentration in that stream thereby creating the driving force for feed to permeate methane flow across the membrane which can be either porous fig 2e or nonporous fig 2f table 1 summarizes the recent studies which used liquid gas mcs sgmc vmc or combination of both for the recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluents both operation modes can achieve a high methane recovery efficiency defined as the ratio of the mass of recovered dissolved methane to that of total dissolved methane in the former the sweep gas pressure is much lower than that required for the conventional degassing units e g bubble column or tray aerator and thus its energy consumption is also comparatively lower nevertheless like the gas stripping process the use of sweep gas produces a highly diluted biogas typically lower than 1 v v methane table 1 such a low grade biogas does not meet the minimum limit 30 v v for combined heat and power chp systems and requires a downstream process to increase the methane content kaparaju and rintala 2013 sgmc exhibits the trade off between the methane recovery efficiency and the methane fraction in the recovered biogas a higher methane recovery efficiency can be achieved by reducing the feed flow rate as the increased residence time of feed in the membrane module enables methane transfer for a longer time period cookney et al 2012 jiménez robles et al 2020 however a reduced feed flow rate leads to a lower mass transfer coefficient of methane in the feed and consequently results in a lower methane flux mass per area and time this trade off relation was demonstrated in recent studies jiménez robles et al 2020 mcleod et al 2016 where the methane fraction in biogas declined quickly with the increase of methane recovery efficiency and vice versa for instance biogas containing 30 v v methane required for chp was recovered at the expense of a methane recovery efficiency of 80 mcleod et al 2016 as such when near complete methane recovery is aimed multi stage sgmc operation may be necessary in vmc while the methane is not diluted by any carrier gas a high vacuum applied in the permeate can induce a considerable water vapor flow across the membrane abdallah et al 2014 cao et al 2020 water vapor is orders of magnitude more permeable than methane in some commonly used polymer membranes crone et al 2016 metz et al 2005 the transmembrane water vapor flow is rarely discussed in the literature of dissolved methane recovery but a recent study that applied vmc towards effluent from uasb reactors reported a substantial water loss rate i e 50 ml day out of the feed volume rate of 700 ml day luo et al 2014 while the process was aimed for co2 removal from the uasb effluent water vapor accounted for 95 v v of the total desorbed gas in addition because of the extracted water vapor or other gas impurities a similar trade off relation between methane recovery efficiency and methane fraction in biogas was also observed sanchis perucho et al 2020 3 2 liquid liquid membrane contactors the significant dilution of methane by the presence of sweep gas or water vapor reduces the recovered biogas quality and demands high cost for its purification before the biogas utilization to minimize the dilution li et al proposed the solvent based membrane contactor smc as a kind of liquid liquid mc in which a non volatile nonpolar organic solvent that has a high methane solubility is employed as the permeate stream fig 2d li et al 2019b across an omniphobic porous membrane wetting resistant to both water and organic liquids fig 2g that is placed between the feed anaerobic effluent and permeate organic solvent dissolved methane in the feed is extracted into the permeate driven by the solubility difference methane recovery efficiencies of 90 at a wide range of temperature 15 c 35 c were demonstrated in addition the use of nonpolar organic solvent as the permeate effectively precludes water vapor flows which can significantly reduce the downstream purification cost such as dehydration for the acquired biogas in their follow up study using anaerobically treated food leachate as feed li et al 2020 a negligible membrane fouling was observed attributed to the absence of the transmembrane water vapor flow while retaining a virtually identical methane recovery efficiency 92 to that from methane rich deionized water as feed nevertheless compared to liquid gas mcs an extra downstream degassing process is required to release the recovered methane from the methane rich permeate stream and regenerate the permeate stream for further circulation while in principle the desorbed biogas would be free from water or the organic solvent producing methane rich biogas has yet to be demonstrated additionally membrane modules of large area omniphobic membranes are not commercially available and long term wetting resistance of the membranes against organic solvents would need to be guaranteed 3 3 limiting parameters on dissolved methane recovery by mcs impact of operating conditions the methane fluxes and recovery efficiencies are directly dependent on various operating conditions including flow mode feed flow velocity membrane types and membrane fouling cookney et al 2016 henares et al 2017 henares et al 2016 generally feed i e anaerobic effluent flowing through the lumen side of the hfm module leads to a higher mass transfer coefficient and therefore a higher methane flux but this flow mode may cause a clogging of lumen channel when the treated effluent contains suspended solids of high concentrations e g egsb or uasb effluent henares et al 2016 conversely a feed flow in the shell side alleviates the fiber clogging but the lower mass transfer coefficient generally results in a lower methane flux the type of membranes either porous or nonporous strongly affects the tendency of membrane wetting a porous membrane poses a negligible resistance for methane transfer across the membrane in comparison with that through the nonporous membrane however if a pore wetting occurs the percolated feed liquid in the membrane pores becomes stagnant and exerts a high transfer resistance for methane henares et al 2016 mavroudi et al 2006 wang et al 2005 likewise membranes with a higher wetting resistance exhibited higher methane fluxes as an increased hydrophobicity prevents pore wetting and minimizes the methane transfer resistance across the membrane wongchitphimon et al 2017 for nonporous membranes used in mcs fig 2c f polymeric materials that are dense but highly gas permeable such as pdms or polyurethane pu are commonly used bandara et al 2011 cookney et al 2012 the nonporous nature does not incur a penetration of liquid and only allows gas species into the membrane however the methane transfer resistance across a nonporous membrane can be several orders of magnitude higher than that of porous membranes crone et al 2016 membranes in mc processes are prone to fouling by commonly found organic foulants including humic like substances proteins and polysaccharides in anaerobic effluents primarily via hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions membrane fouling would not only reduce the methane flux but it can also cause membrane wetting choudhury et al 2019 a recent study further found that the membrane fouling in mcs is aggravated by water vapor flows across the membrane li et al 2020 it was suggested that the convective water flow toward the membrane surface facilitates foulants accumulation on the membrane surface these observations illustrate that deterring water flow would be necessary for an effective fouling control impact of impurities on recovered biogas in addition to dissolved methane anaerobic effluents contain various compounds that readily transfer into the biogas the composition of biogas recovered by mcs can be significantly different from that found in the headspace of anaerobic bioreactors 30 40 v v co2 water vapor 3 7 v v 1 v v h2s trace amounts of nh3 and siloxane deng and hägg 2010 poloncarzova et al 2011 particularly in mcs co2 and water vapor can be major diluents of methane in the acquired biogas which may also compromise the energy production efficacy e g chp also h2s even at a low concentration in biogas adversely impacts the quality of combustion emissions because h2s is oxidized to acidic sulfur dioxide during the combustion which can result in a corrosion of combustion engine components more frequent oil changes and increased maintenance cost the maximum h2s concentration in biogas for internal combustion engines is typically limited to 200 500 ppm fortuny et al 2011 dissolved co2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid bicarbonate and carbonate ions and fractions of these species are strongly influenced by ph snoeyink and jenkins 1980 fig 3 a shows equilibrium concentrations of dissolved co2 in anaerobically treated low strength wastewaters at 25 c at ph 6 5 8 5 of typical anaerobic effluents the inorganic carbon predominantly exists as bicarbonate hco 3 leaving dissolved co2 as a minor species nevertheless at ph 7 8 and total inorganic carbon of 70 mm as an exemplary condition of typical anaerobic effluent li et al 2020 yu et al 2018 the dissolved co2 concentration is nearly the same as the dissolved methane 2 3 mm assuming a methane saturation index of 1 7 such comparable concentrations can cause a significant dilution of methane by co2 in the biogas recovered by mcs henares et al 2016 luo et al 2014 sethunga et al 2018 for instance in liquid gas mc experiments to remove the dissolved co2 and methane from anaerobic effluent henares et al 2016 even if other gas species are neglected the methane content in the desorbed biogas would be estimated to range from 20 to 50 v v well below that of typical biogas likewise theoretically calculated dissolved h2s concentrations are shown in fig 3b from total sulfide concentrations commonly observed in anaerobically treated low strength wastewaters delgado vela et al 2015 pretel et al 2013 at ph 7 the total sulfide of 3 mm would lead to the dissolved h2s of 1 67 mm comparable to the dissolved methane concentration as h2s is highly soluble in water its concentration in the typical biogas is quite low however biogas desorbed from such an effluent by liquid gas mcs may contain a high concentration of h2s although water vapor is not a major constituent in typical biogas it can significantly dilute the biogas acquired by mcs in particular vmc water fluxes in a vmc employing a porous membrane have been rarely reported but it can be estimated from the data in the literature of vacuum membrane distillation which uses the same principle of vacuum induced evaporation for desalination abu zeid et al 2015 the reported water vapor fluxes at operating temperature of 25 35 c 10 500 mol m 2 h 1 are more than two orders of magnitude higher than the methane flux produced in vmc table 1 abdallah et al 2014 baghel et al 2020 bandini et al 1997 as such when vmc is aimed to produce usable methane not merely removing methane a low energy cost dehydration process needs to be sought li et al 2019b moreover the evaporation of water involves a large latent heat of vaporization which would induce a temperature decrease of the feed solution that makes the methane more soluble 3 4 vacuum degasser vacuum degasser has long been used to remove entrained gasses such as h2s and corrosive oxygen from drilling fluids rehm 2005 applying the vacuum degasser for dissolved methane recovery from anaerobically treated wastewater was investigated recently lee et al 2020 a nozzle fitted three stage vacuum degasser was employed to demonstrate a maximum recovery of approximately 94 the anaerobically treated wastewater was sprayed into vacuum chambers with without packing media to enhance the transfer of the dissolved methane into the gas phase their energy analysis showed that the vacuum degasser could achieve a net energy production of 0 05 0 07 kwh per m3 of effluent while it is promising this value was obtained by assuming a relatively low water vaporization similar to vmc the energy producing potential of vacuum degasser can be drastically compromised by significant water vapor flows which deserves a thorough investigation in future studies a temperature drop due to latent heat loss by water evaporation will also increase the gas solubility and slow down the mass transfer additionally although the mass transfer can be enhanced by generating droplets and or installing packing media additional pumping cost for head elevation is required and the vacuum degasser may require multiple stages and a large footprint to sufficiently increase methane transfer rate 4 technologies for reusing dissolved methane on site 4 1 methane fueled mfc as opposed to the methane recovery that requires extraction purification and storage for its later use directly converting the dissolved methane to other forms of energy or chemicals on site can be a simpler alterative for utilizing dissolved methane as a resource or an energy source microbial fuel cells mfcs are bioelectrochemical systems in which the exoelectrogenic microorganisms capable of transferring electrons extracellularly oxidize the organics and deposit electrons onto the anode for electricity production generally methane is not an ideal substrate for the exoelectrogenic microorganisms to respire at the anode however mfcs using uncultured anaerobic methane oxidizing consortia isolated from oceanic sediment produced electricity from methane as the organic substrate albeit a very low power density 0 65 mw m2 ding et al 2017 the anode was enriched with geobacter a common exoelectrogen found in mfcs and also with anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme that can perform anaerobic oxidation of methane aom via reverse methanogenesis suggesting that these microbial communities simultaneously enable the electron deposition onto the anode yet anme typically form syntrophic consortia with sulfate reducing bacteria in nature isolating them for the application of methane fueled mfcs is challenging however it was recently shown that anme residing in deep sea sediments can be catabolically or anabolically decoupled from sulfate reducing bacteria using soluble artificial electron acceptor scheller et al 2016 provided with artificial electron acceptors 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate the isolated anme efficiently oxidized methane based on the proposed pathway for methane to electricity conversion mcanulty et al demonstrated a substantial electricity production from methane in a two chamber mfc using a genetically engineered archaeal strain fig 4 a mcanulty et al 2017 the methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr enzymes produced by the archaeal efficiently converted methane into acetate which is a more favorable organic substrate than methane for g sulfurreducens and other exoelectrogens on the anode a sludge was added to the anodic chamber as electron shuttles i e substances that can be reversibly reduced and oxidized to promote the extracellular electron transfer the electrons migrated to the cathode are consumed through converting ferricyanide to ferrocyanide in the other chamber to complete the circuit and generate electricity fig 4a the mfc produced a maximum power of 168 9 mw m2 comparable to mfcs fueled by other organics logan et al 2015 and with a high coulombic efficiency 90 10 almost all the electrons extracted from methane generated a current subsequently yamasaki et al determined that the electron shuttle was the rate limiting factor in the methane fueled mfc yamasaki et al 2018 with humic acids added as an electron shuttle the power density was increased 10 fold to a remarkably high level 4700 800 mw m2 30 c while maintaining a high coulombic efficiency 82 3 this experiment proved the critical impact of electron shuttle on boosting the power generation in methane fueled mfcs applications of mfcs for on site reuse of dissolved methane while the conventional two chamber mfc is generally operated in the batch mode or the fed batch mode a single chamber air cathode mfcs operated in a continuous mode 20 c was recently investigated for reusing dissolved methane on site to produce electricity chen and smith 2018 fig 4b the aerobic methanotrophs and geobacter enriched in the anode biofilm along with an enhanced oxygen availability by increasing hrt enabled the consumption of up to 85 dissolved methane and the power density production of 62 0 mw m2 however a rather low coulombic efficiency 17 7 was obtained such a low coulombic efficiency was likely due to the loss of electrons during conversion of methane to intermediate metabolites e g formate and scavenging of the metabolites by competing heterotrophic bacteria developing mfcs working at relatively low temperatures is highly desirable for their integration with the psychrophilic anaerobic processes chen and smith in their follow up study investigated the impact of operation temperature 5 25 c on methane driven single chamber mfcs chen and smith 2019 the removal efficiency of dissolved methane remained relatively stable 53 0 63 6 over the operation temperatures however at 10 c and below the power density drastically dropped to 12 mw m2 10 c from 60 6 mw m2 25 c and the coulombic efficiency was decreased by more than half 3 at 10 c the results verify the critical dependency of power output of mfcs on the temperature through its influence on the activation energy electrolyte conductivity diffusivity electrode potential charge transfer rate and others larrosa guerrero et al 2010 li et al 2013 oliveira et al 2013 in addition the sensitive nature of the microbes makes the mfc performance highly susceptible to fluctuations in these variables limitations of mfcs for the reuse of dissolved methane a high power output from methane fueled mfcs relies on genetically engineered archaeal strains effective electron shuttles and well controlled operation conditions additionally when incorporated with psychrophilic anaerobic treatment processes for mainstream wastewater the compromised power generation at low temperatures must be addressed dai et al 2020 while several novel configurations have been proposed to incorporate mfcs into actual wastewater treatment processes mfcs are currently limited to laboratory scale demonstrations and far from the commercialization stage do et al 2018 the highest power density reported for methane fueled mfcs to date thousands of mw m2 is about four to five orders of magnitude lower than chemical fcs 104 105 w m2 the fluctuations of generated voltage and current as well as the insufficient long term stability also remain major challenges in addition the biofouling and its associated high internal resistance restrain the power generation in mfcs logan et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 thus utilizing mfcs as an alternative to chemical fcs is so far still impractical 4 2 coupling oxidation of dissolved methane to denitrification as the anaerobic treatment removes organic carbon but not nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus a post treatment process is usually required to enhance the nutrient removal and meet the stringent discharge criteria lee et al 2018 coagulant dose can readily control effluent phosphorous but nitrogen removal is very challenging due to the insufficient carbon and electrons in the anaerobically treated effluent hence exogenous carbon sources such as methanol should be added to achieve a target removal of nutrient if this dissolved methane could be used as the carbon and electron source for denitrification the entire treatment process can be performed in a much more cost effective manner than the conventional biological nitrogen removal process e g nitrification and denitrification using exogenous electron donor nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo microbes enable a simultaneous denitrification and the removal of dissolved methane in which the dissolved methane can be oxidized anaerobically using nitrate nitrite as electron acceptors alvarino et al 2019 raghoebarsing et al 2006 nc10 bacteria and anme archaea are two major types of microorganisms that play dominant roles in the anmo process raghoebarsing et al 2006 where nitrate is reduced to nitrite by anme with methane as the electron donor and the nitrite is converted to nitrogen gas by nc10 bacteria using electrons derived from methane oxidation n damo microbes can be integrated with anammox bacteria for side stream wastewater or ammonia rich industrial wastewater treatment fan et al 2020 hu et al 2015 liu et al 2020b luesken et al 2011 shi et al 2013 in this coupled process anammox bacteria compete with n damo bacteria for nitrite reduction to dinitrogen while electron donors are different while aeration costs for the full nitrification can be significantly reduced by coupling n damo with anammox its implementation in the mainstream wastewater treatment process faces several challenges first temperature sensitivities of anammox and n damo microorganisms are not well studied and the metabolism of the microorganisms tends to be suppressed at low temperatures e g 15 c although a recent work reported temperature tolerant annamox and n damo microorganisms at 10 c in a lab scale experiment liu et al 2020a tests in larger settings are required to ensure consistent denitrification performance at temperatures of domestic wastewater often 15 c second anammox and n damo microorganisms are not fast growers like heterotrophic denitrifiers and hence their performance in large scale bioreactors is still questionable last associated with limited information a stable partial nitritation is not easily achieved for low strength wastewater instead coupling aerobic methane oxidation to denitrification has often been found in dilute wastewater studies involving methylomonas methylocystis or methylocystis cao et al 2019 lee et al 2019 lee et al demonstrated that methane oxidation was coupled to denitrification under hypoxic conditions even in an air tight membrane biofilm reactor lee et al 2019 a number of studies also showed that aerobic methanotrophs could couple methane oxidation to nitrate nitrite reduction in syntrophy with diverse denitrifiers under hypoxic conditions alrashed et al 2018 alvarino et al 2019 kits et al 2015 orata et al 2018 tang et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 which are close to the operating conditions of anoxic bioreactors widely used in wwtps 4 3 biological conversion of dissolved methane to value added products dissolved methane can be converted by methanotrophs to cellular compounds or organic substrates that have higher commercial prices than methane including proteins biopolymers methanol and organic acids alsayed et al 2018 lebrero and chandran 2017 strong et al 2015 however harvesting these value added products requires a series of downstream processes to separate and purify the final products from the aqueous medium cuellar and straathof 2020 strong et al 2015 particularly when the yield is low and the final product is very diluted this protocol may not be economically viable given the presence of various complex compounds in wastewaters straathof 2011 instead a cost effective reuse of dissolved methane may be achieved if the conversion products are directly usable on site without requiring downstream separation processes knowles 2005 under this scope the biological conversion of dissolved methane to methanol is more attractive than other biological conversion pathways because methanol is considered as the most ideal carbon source added to wastewater in wwtps for the biological nitrogen or phosphate removal gautam et al 2020 lebrero and chandran 2017 thus biomethanol produced from dissolved methane by methanotrophs can be directly utilized for denitrification su et al 2019 which potentially reduces the external carbon demand and the operational cost of wwtps additionally biomethanol is an ideal organic substrate for mfcs myung et al 2018 conversion of methane to methanol can be carried out by methanotrophs using the enzyme methane monooxygenase mmo to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of methane to methanol duan et al 2011 patel et al 2020 pen et al 2014 however as one kind of intermediates in the methane conversion pathway methanol is readily converted to downstream intermediates or co2 kalyuzhnaya et al 2015 adding enzyme inhibitors such as nh4cl phosphate salt of high concentration is one common approach to prevent the further oxidation of methanol and therefore accumulate the methanol bjorck et al 2018 han et al 2013 lebrero and chandran 2017 tabata and okura 2008 still most studies have reported 70 conversion efficiencies of methane to methanol even after an optimization of inhibitor concentration and hours of cultivation at a mesophilic condition 25 35 c lebrero and chandran 2017 a well controlled inhibition without affecting the long term catalytic activity of methanotrophs is still challenging xin et al 2004 moreover the added inhibitors will increase the downstream treatment cost for their removal e g phosphate discounting the benefit of biomethanol production alternatively ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob also enable the methane to methanol conversion through the catalysis by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo su et al 2019 taher and chandran 2013 unlike mob aob oxidize methane to methanol but does not further oxidize methanol to co2 jones and morita 1983 however aob require an external source of reducing power to ensure continuous methane oxidization using nh2oh as the reducing power source taher and chandran showed that up to 59 9 mg cod l of methanol was produced by aob in a fed batch sequential bioreactor with a mixed nitrifying enrichment culture taher and chandran 2013 despite the enhanced methanol yield the requirement of external reducing power sources makes it difficult to justify this approach for producing profits or reducing operating cost in wastewater treatment instead ammonia that is readily available in anaerobic effluent will be a more practical reducing power source for methanol production but the efficiency is much lower than nh2oh su et al 2019 the methane to methanol conversion process working at low temperatures is crucial to integrating the conversion process with psychrophilic anaerobic treatment processes however the optimum temperature for most strains of both mob and aob ranges from 22 c to 30 c bjorck et al 2018 taher and chandran 2013 and in some cases above 30 c gupta and goel 2019 su et al 2017 in addition the slow growth of mob and aob screening of appropriate strains and optimizing cultivation conditions need to be addressed as such a fundamental understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms involved in the oxidation with mmo is required alsayed et al 2018 last the biomethanol production from real anaerobically treated wastewater needs to be demonstrated to assess the viability of integration of the process with the existing wastewater treatment process 5 perspectives and research needs 5 1 comparison of different dissolved methane management technologies a qualitative comparison of dissolved methane management technologies based on several evaluation metrics is summarized in table 2 currently most of technologies can achieve 90 methane treating efficiency mass fraction of removed recovered reused methane to total dissolved methane at ambient or lower temperatures and even when methane is supersaturated on the other hand coupling oxidation of dissolved methane to denitrification may show a compromised treating efficiency when temperature is lower than 15 c owing to the decreased activity of microorganisms mfcs exhibit somewhat lower treating efficiencies 50 85 at ambient temperature the treating efficiencies of biological conversion processes are lower than 90 even when operated at relatively high temperature 25 c as such methane oxidation denitrification coupling mfcs and biological conversion are rated fair two stars while the other technologies are rated good three stars in the treating efficiency of dissolved methane the dissolved methane concentration in liquid phase corresponding to the lower explosive limit of methane in gas phase 5 v v is 1 4 mg l with the safety factor of 10 it is often practiced in industry to maintain the dissolved methane concentration below 0 14 mg l 15 c before discharge to prevent creating a potentially explosive environment cookney et al 2016 this requirement corresponds to the treating efficiency of 99 when treating a saturated or supersaturated effluent to achieve such a high treating efficiency multiple treating units or a longer hrt might be necessary as gas stripping and biological oxidation do not produce energy and the former process even consumes energy in a large amount for aeration their net energy production potential is rated zero among methane recovery and reuse technologies smc and methane oxidation denitrification coupling have high net energy potential due to the much lower requirement of energy intensive post treatment processes than other technologies and to the high treating efficiency of dissolved methane in comparison mfc and biological conversion have lower treating efficiencies lowering net energy production potential two stars liquid gas mcs also exhibit relatively low net energy production potential owing to the large energy requirement for upgrading the harvested biogas or removing the extracted water vapor two stars in addition to the potential requirement of multiple stages and a large physical footprint compared to membrane systems for achieving high treating recovery efficiencies vacuum degassers likely have the similar issue of a high content of water vapor in the acquired biogas due to the uncertainty of energy consumption estimation and the very limited extent of investigation for dissolved methane recovery it is slightly less rated than liquid gas mcs one and half stars provided with a properly selected and adapted microbial culture biological processes in general are relatively robust to other dissolved compounds however some dissolved compounds such as h2s in the effluent can be very detrimental to a number of microbial organisms that have been utilized for dissolved methane management as for mfc another major concern is the biofouling of cathodes and proton exchange membranes therefore in terms of the process robustness to other dissolved compounds biological oxidation methane oxidation denitrification coupling and biological conversion are rated fair two stars and mfc is rated poor one star fouling is also a persistent problem for liquid gas mcs two stars while the absence of water vapor flow effectively mitigates fouling in smc three stars the application of gas stripping is also limited in some cases if the effluent contains a certain amount of foaming induced substances such as surfactants two stars in contrast dissolved compounds in the wastewater have relatively minor impact on the operation of vacuum degasser three stars for scalability gas stripping biological oxidation liquid gas mcs and vacuum degasser are mature technologies and therefore their implementation in a large scale is straightforward three stars although decent treating efficiencies have been demonstrated by smc and methane oxidation denitrification coupling in bench scale hollow fiber modules with highly wetting resistant omniphobic membranes are still not commercially available one star and the long incubation time of some specific microbes is still a notable hindrance for the large scale application of methane oxidation denitrification coupling two stars mfc and biological conversion still suffer from a number of technical hurdles and their pilot scale demonstrations have yet to be done one star 5 2 improving long term process stability generally speaking biological processes for dissolved methane management exhibit relatively stable performances once the microbes adapt to operating conditions conversely membrane based processes for methane recovery are susceptible to membrane wetting and fouling detrimental to the long term process stability robust wetting resistance of the membrane is essential as fatty acids and surfactants present in anaerobic effluents can accelerate the membrane pore wetting during the methane recovery process chew et al 2017 lee et al 2016 membrane wetting resistance can be increased by grafting or coating low surface energy materials e g fluorosilanes or fluoropolymers onto the membrane surface and or attaining surface textures that feature re entrant structure kota et al 2014 lee et al 2016 tuteja et al 2007 these approaches allow for operation of mcs in contact with low surface tension feed sethunga et al 2018 however the long term effectiveness of those membranes for real wastewater is questionable boo et al 2016 using a nonporous membrane circumvents the pore wetting issue but at the potential expense of compromised methane fluxes henares et al 2018 a promising alternative is to fabricate a composite membrane that comprises a thin nonporous layer for wetting prevention and a porous support layer for low transport resistance and mechanical support sethunga et al 2019a membrane fouling can drastically reduce the methane flux common pretreatment processes such as ultrafiltration or nanofiltration effectively remove the organic foulants however biogas bubbles that form on the membrane surface or filtered particles via heterogeneous nucleation would cause a sizable loss of dissolved methane scardina and edwards 2001 fabricating composite membranes consisting of a hydrophilic layer fouling resistant and the hydrophobic omniphobic porous substrate is an alternative approach and showed great promise in fouling prevention and delay in membrane distillation for desalination huang et al 2017 li et al 2019a xu et al 2019 yang et al 2016 these composite membranes have been rarely tested in mcs for dissolved methane recovery very recently however sethunga et al fabricated a composite membrane by coating a pdms based amphiphilic copolymer onto a membrane consisting a dense pdms layer and a pvdf porous substrate which demonstrated a reduced methane flux decline than the uncoated membrane sethunga et al 2020 further experimental studies to substantiate the effectiveness of the composite membranes as well as relatively simple fabrication processes are warrantied finally the role of water vapor flow in aggravated membrane fouling had long been overlooked in mcs until it was recently investigated li et al 2019b as discussed in section 3 3 the recently proposed smc process that employs non water soluble solvent as permeate stream precluded water vapor flow and showed significantly less fouling li et al 2020 likewise identifying the operation conditions or process configurations that deter the transmembrane water vapor flow while enabling the methane flow would minimize the fouling effectively biofouling of proton exchange membranes pem remains a major hurdle for long term stable operation of mfcs noori et al 2019 a biofilm formed on the pem surface can significantly affect the proton conductivity of the membrane the coulombic efficiency and the maximum power density which results in a compromised energy production xu et al 2012 in a study on dual chamber mfc for instance the power density was reduced by 55 from 1 w m2 at two months of operation to 0 45 w m2 at six months due to the biofouling of the pem miskan et al 2016 moreover biofilms also form on the surface of cathode and further deteriorate the power generation performances of mfcs yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 5 3 minimizing the impurity transfer into the biogas while purification processes including chemical absorption pressure swing adsorption dehydration and membrane based gas separation are available for post treatment of biogas angelidaki et al 2018 biogas of high methane contents obtained by mcs is desired to reduce the post treatment cost the methane content in the biogas can be increased by tuning operation conditions of mcs henares et al 2016 in sgmc for instance it has been shown that poorly soluble gasses i e methane experience a much smaller mass transfer resistance in gas phase sweep gas or much higher resistance in liquid phase feed compared to soluble gasses e g co2 rongwong et al 2017 therefore reduced fluxes of soluble impurity gasses relative to the methane flux are anticipated when operating the mcs at a low sweep gas flow rate or a higher feed flow rate this operation is particularly beneficial to reducing h2s flux as h2s is far more soluble than methane given that even a low concentration of h2s would become a severe issue on the utilization of the harvested biogas several relevant studies also demonstrated that lowering the gas flow rate in sgmc could drastically slow down the transfer of dissolved h2s while its effect on the methane flux was negligible boucif et al 2008 cookney et al 2012 cookney et al 2016 similarly a recent modeling study for smc process suggests that biogas of a significantly higher methane content compared to the typical biogas is attainable by controlling feed to draw flow rate ratios dutta et al 2021 in addition the methane content can be further increased in smc process by employing a permeate solvent that has a high solubility contrast between methane and other gas impurities which has yet to be demonstrated 5 4 assessment of methane removal recovery and reuse in realistic settings most of methane recovery or reuse techniques are still in the phase of lab scale demonstration making it challenging to assess their energy consumption membrane processes and feasibility particularly for biological processes in realistic settings for biological processes of dissolved methane management one of the main challenges is the stability to low temperature as a potential approach psychrotolerant microorganisms can be enriched to given bioprocesses e g mfcs coupling methane oxidation to denitrification and bio conversion bale et al 2019 reino et al 2018 for example some anammox bacteria enriched from wastewater treatment plant sludge were shown to survive at 11 c and maintain their activity during temperature disturbances reino et al 2018 establishing an overcapacity of microorganisms through optimizing reactor structure and operational strategies potentially mitigates the activity loss of microorganisms at low temperatures liu et al 2020a and bioaugmentation using biofilms or bio carriers would be realistic to overcome this challenge such as moving bed biofilm reactors young et al 2017 a pilot scale gas sparged anmbr treating low strength wastewater at seasonally varying temperatures with the capacity of dissolved methane and nutrient recovery was recently commissioned and operated in the u s evans et al 2018 lim et al 2019 the average recovery efficiency of dissolved methane was 79 2 and the maximum h2s removal was 39 with insignificant fractional changes in dissolved co2 however even for mcs that are the closest to large scale implementation most energetics analyses are purely theoretical on the basis of an ideal or incomplete methane recovery process for example in either vmc or smc operation vacuum pumping to extract the dissolved methane from the aqueous feed or organic solvent accounts for a substantial fraction of energy consumption when estimating the power input of vacuum pumping the analyses often consider the methane flow rate only instead of total gas flow rate jiménez robles et al 2020 rongwong et al 2017 as aforementioned there are strong evidences that vmc involves non negligible fluxes of water vapor and co2 ignoring these fluxes would considerably underestimate the energy consumption for smc likewise demonstrating the downstream treatment of organic solvent i e degassing and regeneration with a continuous methane recovery process is a critical element for assessing the technical and economic viabilities however commercial modules of large area omniphobic membrane are still not available in addition the recovered biogas containing impurities may need to be purified prior to energy production but such purification cost is rarely included in most analyses li et al 2019b rongwong et al 2018 6 conclusion this paper presented an overview of existing and emerging technologies for removal recovery or reuse of dissolved methane in anaerobically treated low strength wastewater and comparative assessment of their efficacies suitabilities and challenges although effective methane removal processes essentially have no net energy production potential membrane based recovery processes effectively extract the dissolved methane at a wide temperature range and are probably the most scalable however their net energy production potential would be restricted by the energy consumption to remove gas impurities from the acquired biogas the processes are highly susceptible to fouling and wetting a complete energetics analysis that accounts for recovery to biogas purification and energy production is not available on site reuse biotechnologies directly convert dissolved methane to other forms of energy which can obviate the energy input for methane recovery and its downstream processing and thus show net energy production potential however the drastically reduced conversion efficiency at psychrophilic conditions as well as the limited scalability remains a significant challenge on their applications for mainstream wastewater treatment future research endeavors should be directed to complete large scale demonstration in realistic settings to accurately assess the energy potential of the dissolved methane management technologies critical to realizing an energy neutral or even energy positive mainstream wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest none

sample contains bacteria from a large number of individuals here the value of sewage monitoring in early warning of cpe was assessed at the sahlgrenska university hospital in gothenburg sweden a setting with low prevalence of cpe twenty composite hospital sewage samples were collected during a two year period carbapenemase genes in the complex samples were analyzed by quantitative pcr and the cpe loads were assessed through cultures on cpe selective agar followed by species determination as well as phenotypic and genotypic tests targeting carbapenemases of presumed cpe the findings were related to cpe detected in hospitalized patients a subset of cpe isolates from sewage and patients were subjected to whole genome sequencing for three of the investigated carbapenemase genes bla ndm bla oxa 48 like and bla kpc there was concordance between gene levels and abundance of corresponding cpe in sewage for the other two analyzed genes bla vim and bla imp there was no such concordance most likely due to the presence of those genes in non enterobacterales populating the sewage samples in line with the detection of oxa 48 like and ndm producing cpe in sewage these were also the most commonly detected cpe in patients ndm producing cpe were detected on a single occasion in sewage and isolated strains were shown to match strains detected in a patient a marked peak in cpe producing oxa 48 like enzymes was observed in sewage during a few months when levels started to increase there were no known cases of such cpe at the hospital but soon after a few cases were detected in samples from patients the oxa 48 like producing cpe from sewage and patients represented different strains but they carried similar bla oxa 48 like harbouring mobile genetic elements in conclusion sewage analyses show both promise and limitations as a complement to traditional clinical resistance surveillance for early warning of rare forms of resistance further evaluation and careful interpretation are needed to fully assess the value of such a sewage monitoring system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater epidemiology cpe carbapenemase antibiotic resistance hospital sewage 1 introduction a significant contributing factor to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance is the continuous emergence of novel resistance factors in pathogens via horizontal gene transfer one such example is carbapenemase producing enterobacterales cpe which have spread globally during the 21st century logan and weinstein 2017 pitout et al 2019 while cpe are commonly detected in clinical samples in many countries they are still rare in other parts of the world including the nordic countries ecdc 2019 up to date local surveillance is a cornerstone for the management of antibiotic resistance in particular for informing empirical treatment before the resistance profile of an infectious agent is determined resistance surveillance can also guide other management actions for example by serving as an early warning system for emerging and still rare forms of resistance including detection of asymptomatic carriage to be informative surveillance data therefore needs to be based on samples from a large number of individuals which not only include clinical cultures but also screening cultures to detect carriers as this is highly resource demanding and in the case of fecal screening can be questioned also from an ethical perspective nijsingh et al 2020 sewage analyses have emerged as a possible attractive complement to traditional clinical surveillance since a single sewage sample can contain bacteria from thousands of individuals aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 huijbers et al 2019 recently resistance rates in sewage and clinical escherichia coli isolates have been shown to correlate huijbers et al 2020 hutinel et al 2019 in these studies the isolation of sewage e coli was conducted using non selective agar i e no addition of antibiotics this gives the possibility to assess resistance rates for a wide panel of antibiotics including various co resistance patterns in an un biased way the approach is however not suitable for studying rare forms of resistance for these purposes methodologies more efficient in screening large numbers of bacteria in the sewage samples could be applied such as cultivation on selective plates or sensitive pcr analyses of total dna extracted from the samples in support of a pcr based approach a recent pcr array based study showed that antibiotic resistance gene abundance in sewage could reflect differences in clinical resistance patterns across europe parnanen et al 2019 to assess the value of sewage analyses in early warning of rare resistance threats we here aimed to analyze carbapenemase genes and cpe in hospital sewage and relate those observations to cpe in samples from the corresponding hospitalized population we also aimed to investigate if pcr based sewage analyses could provide similar information as the more resource demanding culture based approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study setting and cpe isolates from patients confirmed cpe cases are still rare in sweden cpe are notifiable according to swedish law and during 2015 2017 the total number of detected cases nationwide was 413 and 85 were either bla oxa 48 like or bla ndm harboring bacteria mostly imported cases detected through targeted fecal screening swedres svarm 2019 the study was conducted at the sahlgrenska university hospital in gothenburg which is the largest hospital in sweden 1950 beds with approximately 450 000 patient days year during the study period anonymized information regarding all confirmed cases with cpe at the hospital during the study period was provided by the infection control unit cpe were detected either in screening samples or in samples taken due to clinical signs of infection the clinical microbiology laboratory analyzed approximately 14 000 urine samples and 11 000 blood cultures from patients at the main site of the hospital on a yearly basis approximately 2000 fecal rectal screening samples were analyzed each year for the presence of multidrug resistant bacteria including cpe fecal rectal screening of patients is part of the hospital infection control program stating that all patients hospitalized abroad within the preceding year and patients carrying certain risk factors e g diarrhea or urinary catheter in combination with a refugee status should be screened for cpe at or just prior to admission screened once in addition patients at certain units e g hematology and transplantation are also screened on admission patient samples received at the clinical microbiology laboratory for diagnostic purposes of possible clinical infections were analyzed according to routine clinical microbiology practice including the use of maldi tof for species identification for antibiotic susceptibility testing the disk diffusion method and breakpoints according to eucast s recommendations at the time were used gram negative isolates were subjected to meropenem susceptibility testing either directly or following detection of cephalosporin or amoxicillin clavulanic acid resistance isolates non susceptible to meropenem using the eucast screening breakpoint for cpe detection were screened for bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla kpc bla imp and bla vim and bla ges by pcr monteiro et al 2012 samples obtained through patient screening stool or rectal swabs were plated on drigalski agar a selective media for gram negative bacteria in the presence of an ertapenem disk placed in the primary streak the plates were incubated at 37 up to 42 h read daily no prior enrichment culture was used all colonies with differing morphologies in a sample with decreased susceptibility to ertapenem zone diameter 28 mm were tested further for the detection of cpe as outlined above 2 2 sewage samples a total of twenty composite sewage samples were collected from april 2015 to august 2017 at a sampling point 57 40 52 1 n 11 57 31 4 e where raw sewage from the great majority of the main hospital site is collected each sample was collected over 24 h in a time proportional manner i e a subsample was collected every ninth minute samples were refrigerated during the sampling procedure and after being collected the composite samples were processed within three hours from being collected 2 3 relative quantification of carbapenemase genes in sewage samples by quantitative pcr total dna was isolated from each composite sewage samples by passing 40 ml through 0 45 µm pore size filters applying a vacuum manifold before using a powerwater dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna concentrations were measured with a qubit fluorometer invitrogen carlsbad ca using quantitative pcr qpcr the carbapenemase genes bla ndm bla oxa 48 like including e g bla oxa 48 bla oxa 181 and bla oxa 244 bla kpc bla imp and bla vim as well as the esbl gene bla ctx m group 1 including e g bla ctx m 15 were quantified using 16s as a reference gene all pcr reactions were run in 96 well plates by mixing 2 µl sewage dna with 10 µl 2 power sybr green pcr master mix applied biosystems carlsbad ca and 0 5 um of pcr primers eurofins genomics ebersberg germany table s1 in a total volume of 20 µl standard amplification conditions described for the 7500 real time pcr system were used and all reactions were run in duplicates dna from k pneumoniae ccug60138 bla ndm k pneumoniae ccug60138 bla ndm k pneumoniae h080820413 bla oxa 48 k pneumoniae ccug56233 bla kpc p aeruginosa ccug59626 or k44 24 bla imp k pneumoniae ccug58547 bla vim and e coli 10 36051a bla ctx m 15 prepared with the dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen hilden germany was used as positive controls the pcr efficiency for each primer pair was in the range of 1 9 2 0 when using standard curves prepared by dna from positive controls alone and for bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla kpc and bla vim also when the standard curves were prepared by diluting the positive control dna in complex dna from a sewage sample negative for the carbapenemase genes the latter test could not be performed for the other genes since they were ubiquitous in the sewage samples to further ensure limited interference by pcr inhibitors hospital sewage dna was analyzed at three different quantities resulting in 10 5 and 2 5 ng dna in the final reactions for the analysis of the 16s gene the dna was 64 fold more diluted than for the analyses of carbapenemase genes due to the very high 16s abundance the differences in the dilution of dna were adjusted for before the formula 2ct 16s ct target was used to calculate the abundance of the different target genes following detection in sewage samples pcr amplicons from at least one selected sample per gene were purified by using the qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen hilden germany and confirmed to correspond to the target genes by sanger sequencing eurofins genomics 2 4 bacterial cultures sewage samples were serially diluted in 0 85 nacl solution before 100 µl aliquots of the 10 1 10 2 and 10 3 dilutions were used to inoculate chromagar ecc plates chromagar paris france in triplicates cpe selective plates ecc supplemented with meropenem 0 25 µg ml and chromid oxa 48 biomerieux marcy l étoile france were inoculated with 100 µl and 500 µl of the undiluted samples in triplicates samples from 2015 were not cultured on ecc meropenem plates all agar plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h before colonies were counted blue and pink colonies on ecc plates non selective were counted to assess the total number of e coli and other coliforms respectively blue and pink colonies on ecc meropenem and chromid oxa 48 were regarded as presumptive cpe out of these the blue colonies on ecc meropenem and the pink colonies on chromid oxa 48 plates were presumed to be e coli whereas the remaining were presumed to be other coliforms 2 5 species determination of collected sewage isolates from cpe selective plates up to twenty colonies of both presumed e coli and presumed other coliforms per plate type and sample were randomly collected and subjected to species determination by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry maldi tof ms using the vitek ms system biomerieux in an earlier study 99 7 of the blue colonies on ecc plates inoculated with the type of sewage samples used here were confirmed to be e coli by maldi tof ms hutinel et al 2019 to assess the number of colonies corresponding to other species on cpe selective plates the total count of the non e coli coliform population was multiplied with the relative abundance of the species within that subpopulation according to maldi tof ms analyses 2 6 detection of carbapenemase activity in collected sewage isolates by carba np test for each sample if available five to ten isolates of both e coli and other coliforms confirmed by maldi tof ms from both chromid oxa 48 and ecc meropenem plates were subjected to carba np test according to dortet et al dortet et al 2014 k pneumoniae ccug60138 or ccug68728 both bla ndm and k pneumoniae ccug64452 bla oxa 48 were used as positive controls whereas k pneumoniae ccug59346 bla ampc overexpression and k pneumoniae ccug59359 bla tem 52 served as negative controls 2 7 detection of carbapenemase genes in collected sewage isolates by pcr the isolates subjected to carba np test were also screened for carbapenemase genes by pcr total dna was isolated from the strains using the dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen and eluted in 100 µl provided ae buffer the pcr reactions consisted of 0 625 u amplitaq polymerase 2 5 µl pcr buffer 3 mm mgcl 0 2 mm dntps all from applied biosystems 0 4 µm pcr primers eurofins genomics table s1 and 2 µl dna in a total volume of 25 µl dna targets were amplified via an initial activation step at 94 c for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 55 c 60 c for blakpc for 30 s and 72 c for 40 s before a final elongation step at 72 c for 7 min using a geneamp pcr system 9700 applied biosystems the same carbapenemase harboring strains that served as positive controls for the real time pcr assays were used as controls also here 2 8 whole genome sequencing based on species and carbapenemase gene content whole genome sequencing was conducted for sewage and patient isolates with similar profiles the sequenced isolates 33 from eight sewage samples and nine from six patients were each given an id that starts with an s sewage or p patient followed by the collection date yymmdd and ends with a running number total dna was prepared from the isolates using the dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen and sent for sequencing at science for life laboratories stockholm sweden truseq dna libraries were prepared and sequenced on illumina miseq flowcells producing 2 250 bp paired end reads sewage and patient isolates that were most similar to each other based on sequence type st and or tentative carbapenemase harboring plasmid content information retrieved from illumina sequencing were additionally subjected to long read sequencing in order to allow more complete assembly of the genomes this was after isolation of total dna with qiagen genomic tips 500 g conducted via either single molecule real time sequencing technology smrt on the pacbio platform pacific biosciences menlo park ca or oxford nanopore technolgy on a minion using the rapid barcoding kit sqk rbk004 and a flo min106 flowcell the raw sequencing data was submitted to the sequence read archive and connected to bioproject prjna701733 2 9 sequence analyses the short reads from illumina sequencing were used in the genome assembly of all isolates first the quality of the reads was assessed using fastqc andrews 2010 then paired end reads with low quality bases were trimmed to reach a score of 20 and single reads with less than 20 bases in length were filtered using trim galore krueger 2012 the remaining paired end and single reads were assembled into longer contigs using spades with following parameters careful k 21 33 55 77 99 127 bankevich et al 2012 in order to assist the selection of isolates for long read sequencing the contigs were mapped to known sequenced plasmids from ncbi genome database downloaded 13 july 2018 using mummer 3 0 delcher et al 2003 the long reads generated subsequently for a subset of the isolates were combined with short reads to produce longer and more accurate contigs using a hybrid assembly approach long reads produced by minion were basecalled using guppy v3 4 5 in high accuracy mode guppy was also used to demultiplex and trim the barcodes from the reads nanoplot v1 29 1 was used to assess their quality de coster et al 2018 the short and long reads produced either on the pacbio or minion platorm were combined into hybrid assemblies using unicycler v0 4 8 in conservative mode wick et al 2017 the st of the isolates were identified as follows first the data related to species of interest i e e coli achtman scheme and k pneumoniae pasteur scheme were downloaded from the databases of allelic profiles and sequences on pubmlst https pubmlst org data accessed 1 december 2020 then contigs were searched against them using the blastn algorithm in the blast package camacho et al 2009 the presence of an exact and complete set of genes was assessed for each isolate and the corresponding st was reported open reading frames orfs on contigs were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 before diamond v0 9 24 buchfink et al 2015 was used to search orfs against resfinder database downloaded 1 december 2020 zankari et al 2012 in order to identify mobile antibiotic resistance genes insertion sequences were identified with isfinder siguier et al 2006 to identify plasmid replicons contigs were searched against plasmidfinder database downloaded 13 july 2020 carattoli et al 2014 using the blastn algorithm replicon sequences with greater than 95 identity and 60 coverage were reported the relatedness of isolates plasmids was also estimated by calculating the two way average nucleotide identity ani goris et al 2007 with ani calculator http enve omics ce gatech edu ani blastn was used for the alignment of the nucleotide sequences altschul et al 1990 2 10 statistical analysis pearson s coefficient was used to evaluate correlation between growth on chromid oxa 48 plates and levels of bla oxa 48 like in sewage significance of the correlation coefficient was assessed by t test using the graphpad prism software graphpad software inc san diego ca 3 results 3 1 cpe isolated from patients during the more than two year long study period cpe were only isolated from seven patients hospitalized in wards contributing to the sewage at the sampling point a patient from which cpe was isolated at a nearby hospital within two weeks after the patient was cared but not screened at the studied hospital was also included in the study in total e coli and or k pneumoniae isolates positive for bla oxa 48 bla ndm and bla vim were detected in specimens from four four and one patient s respectively as shown in table 1 3 2 carbapenemase genes in sewage samples the bla oxa 48 like gene was detected in 19 of 20 analyzed sewage samples using qpcr after being detected at low levels in the first samples from 2015 a clear peak was seen in the end of that year and the beginning of 2016 fig 1 levels of bla oxa 48 like varied more than 1000 fold this should be compared to the relatively stable levels observed for bla ctx m varied 15 fold which was included as comparison in contrast to bla oxa 48 like the bla ndm gene was only detected in the sewage sample from april 2017 fig 1 among the other investigated carbapenemase genes bla kpc was not detected in any of the samples whereas bla vim and bla imp were detected in 18 and 19 samples respectively bla imp was not analyzed in one of the samples fig 1 the levels of bla vim varied more than 1000 fold bla imp was consistently detected at relatively high levels and varied less 20 fold 3 3 cpe in sewage samples cultivation on two different selective plates revealed presence of presumptive cpe in all but two of the analyzed sewage samples fig 2 subsequent genotypic and phenotypic analyses of collected isolates detected oxa 48 like and ndm producing cpe but no cpe producing kpc vim or imp tables 2 and 3 3 3 1 chromid oxa 48 plates when cultured on chromid oxa 48 plates presumptive e coli and non e coli coliforms were detected in all but three and two sewage samples respectively fig 2a and b all presumed e coli analyzed by maldi tof ms were verified to be e coli n 92 tables 2 and s2 out of 45 e coli isolates that were further analyzed 44 were pcr positive for bla oxa 48 like and 39 were positive in the carba np test tables 3 and s3 the great majority of the presumed non e coli coliforms were identified as k pneumoniae 122 149 the remaining were identified as either raoultella spp or serratia spp which were detected in two sewage samples each tables 2 and s2 all 64 further tested k penumoniae and raoultella isolates harbored oxa 48 like genes and 59 of them were also positive in the carba np test all ten further tested serratia marcescens isolates were negative for the five investigated carbapenemase genes tested by pcr as well as in the carbanp test tables 3 and s3 in accordance with the qpcr analyses a peak in growth on the chromid oxa 48 plates for both e coli and other coliform was observed in the beginning of 2016 with much higher levels than observed in the previous samples fig 2a and b also in line with the qpcr data was the non detection of oxa 48 like producing cpe in the sewage sample from february 2017 consequently a significant correlation was observed between bla oxa 48 like abundance and the total growth of e coli k pneumoniae and raoultella spp on chromid oxa 48 plates fig 3 3 3 2 ecc meropenem plates cultivation of sewage samples on ecc meropenem plates showed the presence of presumptive cpe in all but one of the analyzed samples samples from 2015 were not analyzed on this media fig 2c and d again it was the sample from february 2017 that was negative also in parallel with what was seen on chromid oxa 48 plates the highest counts for presumptive e coli was seen in the beginning of 2016 and all tested isolates were verified to be e coli by maldi tof ms n 130 tables 2 and s2 of the 72 e coli isolates subjected to further analyses 60 were positive in the carbanp test and 63 were positive for any of the screened carbapenemase genes 57 bla oxa 48 positive and six bla ndm positive tables 3 and s3 all bla ndm carrying e coli were isolated from the april 2017 sample the sample in which bla ndm was detected by qpcr all tested presumed non e coli coliforms from the ecc meropenem plates were confirmed by maldi tof ms tables 2 and s2 hence only enterobacterales spp were identified among the isolates collected from both types of cpe selective agar plates k pneumoniae were like on chromid oxa 48 plates commonly detected on ecc meropenem media not least in the beginning of 2016 as well as after cultivation of the sample from april 2017 however in contrast to what was observed on chromid oxa 48 plates the non e coli coliform population on ecc meropenem plates was dominated by other species than k pneumoniae and included enterobacter spp raoultella spp and klebsiella oxytoca among the 61 isolates from the ecc meropenem plates subjected to further analyses a carbapenemase gene could be detected by pcr in almost all 13 14 of the k pneumoniae and the single k oxytoca isolate tables 3 and s3 again bla oxa 48 like was the most commonly detected gene the bla ndm gene was detected in k pneumoniae isolates from the sample that also harbored ndm producing e coli april 2017 twelve of the klebsiella isolates were carbanp positive in sharp contrast almost all of the tested enterobacter 38 39 and raoultella 6 7 isolates were negative both in the carbanp test and the pcr based carbapenemase screening indicating the carriage of other non targeted resistance mechanisms which allowed them to grow on ecc meropenem plates tables 3 and s3 although presumptive non e coli cpe were detected in all but one of the samples analyzed on ecc meropenem plates pcr and carba np tests could not identify any cpe in five of the samples may june september and december 2016 as well as may 2017 only one of the five isolates analyzed from the august 2017 sample was confirmed to be cpe for these six samples none of the collected isolates were k pneumoniae whereas k pneumoniae was always detected among collected isolates from the other samples in summary the detection of carbapenemase gene carrying k pneumoniae on ecc meropenem plates followed the same pattern as observed for e coli highest levels in the beginning of 2016 due to bla oxa 48 like positive strains and in the sample from april 2017 due to bla ndm positive strains on the other sampling occasions with the exception of march 2017 the non e coli coliform population on ecc meropenem plates was dominated by strains that could not be confirmed to be cpe 3 4 comparisons of findings in sewage and patients carbapenemase genes detected in sewage cpe were restricted to bla oxa 48 like and bla ndm which also were the most common carbapenemase genes in cpe from patients when the levels of bla oxa 48 like and corresponding cpe in sewage increased dramatically in the end of 2015 no patients with cpe were detected however during or soon after the observed peak in sewage three patients number 3 4 and 5 in table 1 with the same type of cpe regarding species and carbapenemase gene were identified february may 2016 one additional case was detected in july 2017 in close connection to the detection of bla ndm positive cpe in sewage samples this type of cpe was detected in a patient sample april 2017 cpe carrying bla ndm were also detected in three additional patients none of these samples were taken within two weeks of a sewage sampling 3 4 1 whole genome sequencing of blaoxa 48 like positive cpe all sequenced bla oxa 48 like positive sewage isolates carried the bla oxa 48 gene and all but one collected on seven sampling occasions were e coli st2450 n 12 or k pneumoniae st147 n 12 table s4 one bla oxa 48 carrying sewage e coli isolate s 160622 2 was st38 none of the sequenced bla oxa 48 like positive isolates from patients of which three were shown to carry bla oxa 48 two to carry bla oxa 181 and one to carry bla oxa 244 belonged to any of these sts table s4 however the isolates from patient 4 as well as all the e coli st2450 and k pneumoniae st147 sewage isolates seemed to carry related plasmids since contigs from their short read assemblies covered the majority of pe71t genbank kc335143 a 64 kilo base pair bla oxa 48 harboring incl plasmid power et al 2014 and other poxa 48a like plasmids pitout et al 2019 poirel et al 2012 long read sequencing confirmed that the patient and sewage isolates contained bla oxa 48 plasmids closely related to poxa 48a like plasmids including pe71t 99 95 99 98 ani the three isolates from patient 4 carried very similar incl plasmids harboring the blaoxa 48 gene in a tn1999 2 composite transposon table s4 pitout et al 2019 power et al 2014 the two k pneumoniae isolates p 160217 1 and p 160405 2 collected on different dates from that patient were the same strain 100 ani and carried the exact same blaoxa 48 plasmid the e coli isolated from the same patient p 160405 1 carried a bla oxa 48 plasmid with 99 98 nucleotide identity to the one of the k pneumoniae isolates although overall very closely related to plasmids from patient 4 99 96 99 98 ani the blaoxa 48 carrying plasmids of sewage isolates subjected to long read sequencing had slightly different structures the blaoxa 48 plasmids of two sewage isolates s 160113 4 and s 160121 1 contained a 135 base pair segment in an already interrupted gene coding for a dna primase which was not present in the plasmids from patient 4 additionally the orientation of tn1999 2 was inverted in s 160113 4 and in s 160121 1 the blaoxa 48 was in a tn1999 composite transposon which lacks the is1r element present in tn1999 2 pitout et al 2019 poirel et al 2012 long read sequencing also revealed another mobile genetic element mge containing bla oxa 48 like for which close resemblance between clinical and sewage isolates was evident in s 160622 2 the only sewage e coli isolate of a divergent st st38 table s4 the bla oxa 48 gene was chromosomally located in a truncated tn1999 2 which is embedded in the composite transposon tn6237 100 identity with genbank kt444705 pitout et al 2019 turton et al 2016 an almost identical chromosomally located composite transposon was detected in the clinical e coli isolate p 160213 1 the transposon in the clinical isolate only differed by one nucleotide which changed the bla oxa 48 gene to bla oxa 244 3 4 2 whole genome sequencing of blandm positive cpe all six sequenced bla ndm positive sewage e coli isolates belonged to st694 whereas the two sequenced bla ndm positive sewage k pneumoniae isolates belonged to different sts 307 and unknown among the four sequenced bla ndm positive isolates from patients two were of the same sts as the sewage isolates table s4 these strains were isolated from the same patient in close connection to the collection of the bla ndm positive sewage isolates and were e coli st694 p 170419 1 and k pneumoniae st307 p 170419 2 all five bla ndm positive isolates subjected to long read sequencing carried the carbapenemase gene on very similar 83 kilo base pair incm2 plasmids table s4 the sewage e coli s 170425 2 and s 170425 6 were the same strain as the patient isolate p 170419 1 100 ani and carried identical bla ndm1 harboring plasmids the sewage k pneumoniae s 170425 8 was the same strain as the patient isolate p 170419 2 100 ani and carried a bla ndm1 harboring plasmid differing from the one of the e coli isolates by only six nucleotides including four nucleotides changing bla ctx m 28 found on the e coli plasmid into bla ctx m 3 in k pneumoniae table s4 4 discussion this study investigates if detection of carbapenemase genes and cpe in hospital sewage samples can provide information on the presence of such bacteria among admitted patients the majority of the characterized sewage cpe or the carbapenemase harboring mges they carried showed apparent relation to cpe detected in patient samples for three of the five investigated carbapenemase genes qpcr analyses provided similar information regarding abundance of corresponding sewage cpe as culture based analyses we will below scrutinize the results and discuss the evidence for using sewage analyses as an early warning and surveillance system for cpe over the study period there was detection of bla oxa 48 like positive cpe in most sewage samples of bla ndm positive cpe on a single occasion and no detection of bla kpc positive cpe this qualitatively reflected what was observed in patient samples from the studied hospital i e detection of cpe producing oxa 48 like and or ndm but none producing kpc the findings of cpe in sewage were also clearly matched by the carbapenemase gene specific qpcr analyses of the complex sewage samples hence there was a good accordance between abundance of genes and corresponding types of cpe in the sewage samples for the three carbapenemase genes most frequently detected in isolates from patients in all of sweden swedres svarm 2019 the two additional carbapenemase genes included in this study bla vim and bla imp were detected in the majority of sewage samples but not in any of the collected cpe isolates although high qpcr signals were detected for both genes in contrast to the other three these two genes are often carried in the form of integron gene cassettes and are as such widespread in several non enterobacterales species logan and weinstein 2017 hence the qpcr detection of these genes in the present study is likely due to the presence of bla vim bla imp harboring strains of non enterobacterales species in the sewage and would thus be less informative regarding the presence and early warning of cpe however it should be acknowledged that non enterobacterales hosts have been described also for bla ndm walsh et al 2011 bla kpc villegas et al 2007 and bla oxa 48 like genes meunier et al 2016 tacão et al 2018 in addition to having the potential to provide qualitative information about cpe in the contributing population the sewage analyses also provide quantitative measurements that might inform about cpe prevalence in order to serve as an appropriate surveillance and early warning system an increased sewage signal should indicate increased prevalence in the contributing population this was clearly seen for bla ndm positive cpe when the single sewage detection coincided with detection of such cpe in a patient sample in addition three of the four patients known to carry be infected with bla oxa 48 like positive cpe were detected during the beginning of 2016 when there was a dramatic peak of such cpe in the sewage other studies have also shown similar repertoires of cpe in sewage and patient samples a screening of samples from twenty wastewater treatment plants in the east of england could detect cpe that based on species and carbapenemase genes largely mirrored what was found in samples from patients ludden et al 2017 in addition an analysis of sewage sampled across israel could observe that the most commonly detected cpe types matched those in the clinic meir gruber et al 2016 in neither of these two studies a comparison between wastewater and patient isolates beyond species and carbapenemase genes was conducted in the present study whole genome sequencing showed that bla ndm positive strains isolated from sewage were almost identical to cpe strains from a patient emphasizing that what we observe in the sewer can inform about the situation in the clinical setting several earlier studies have also shown identically typed cpe in patients and sewage sewage contaminated water khan et al 2018 lepuschitz et al 2019 mahon et al 2017 however the sequenced bla oxa 48 like positive sewage strains in the current study differed from those identified in patients although they carried closely related bla oxa 48 like harboring mobile genetic elements all of the bla oxa 48 like harboring elements detected in sewage were related to such found in cpe from patients a likely at least partial explanation for finding some cpe strains in sewage but not in patients could be that although a screening program is in place cpe carriers might remain undetected only a minor fraction of the patients are screened for cpe and generally only once i e at or just prior to admission none of the visitors and staff are screened if carriers do not develop subsequent infection with cpe which based on studies of patients carrying esbl producing enterobacterales at the hospital can be presumed to be very rare lindblom et al 2018 it would further prevent detection of cpe in the clinical setting thus the bla oxa 48 like carrying strains in the sewage might represent a silent outbreak at the hospital the marked increase during a few consecutive months fits this hypothesis the dramatic increase in bla oxa 48 like positive cpe and bla oxa 48 like genes in the sewage during the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016 also matches the evident increase in number of such cpe cases in patients on a national level in sweden during those years swedres svarm 2019 repeated shedding into the sewage from another source such as environmental biofilms containing cpe could possibly also contribute to the observed peak in sewage bla oxa 48 like positive cpe in a recent investigation of biofilms in the main sewer at a french hospital carbapenemase producing bacteria were detected but no cpe ory et al 2019 in contrast weingarten and co workers isolated cpe from hospital wastewater pipe sludge and multiple studies have shown that hospital sinks can harbor cpe clarivet et al 2016 decraene et al 2018 kizny gordon et al 2017 regev yochay et al 2018 weingarten et al 2018 however even if the commonly detected oxa 48 producing sewage cpe in the present study represent strains thriving in the draining sewer systems it is likely that they or at least their plasmids have been introduced by the hospital population at an earlier time point it is striking that all but one of the sequenced oxa 48 producing sewage cpe isolates were either k pneumoniae st147 or e coli st2450 a finding that could support either of the abovementioned suggested explanations silent outbreak or repeated shedding from a source in the wastewater network similar explanations were recently suggested i e residency in the wastewater system and or circulation in the contributing community when two esbl positive e coli clones were repeatedly isolated from a wastewater pump station in a norwegian suburb paulshus et al 2019 on occasions when there is a non complete match between patient and sewage isolates but still detection of closely related mges carrying the relevant antibiotic resistance gene it could be a result of horizontal gene transfer between strains detected in patient and sewage samples the sharing of genetic material could in addition to within the patient s microbiome occur in the sewers or in the hospital environment connected to the sewage system such an event has earlier been postulated to have occurred in a sink drain at the hospital studied by weingarten et al weingarten et al 2018 in the present study closely related bla oxa 48 like carrying mges were detected in patient and sewage isolates however since those mges represent groups of closely related mges acting as main drivers behind the global spread of bla oxa 48 like genes pitout et al 2019 it is quite plausible that individuals other than the patients detected in this study were sources of the mges observed in sewage importantly the initial detection in sewage isolates occurred when there were still no known cpe cases at the hospital and thus preceded the detection in isolates from patient samples this suggests a value of sewage monitoring as an early warning system the evident increase in bla oxa 48 like positive cpe in the sewage during a few consecutive months also warrants some reflection with regard to the magnitude of that peak measured levels of bla oxa 48 like positive e coli were as high as a few percent of total e coli in the sewage samples and both qpcr signals and relative colony forming unit counts were up to 1000 fold higher than observations at other time points even though both constant changes in the hospitalized population and the risk for transmission of cpe between individuals are factors that could contribute to fluctuating levels of cpe prevalence it seems unlikely that the number of carriers infected at the hospital should vary that much a possible explanation could be that the low levels observed are due to bacteria released from biofilms in the sewers creating a background signal and that it is only the higher levels that correspond to direct detection of carriers at the hospital since we saw a perfect match between ndm producing strains in the sewage and strains from the single carrier detected in the clinic in april 2017 it is tempting to speculate that the ndm signals e g 0 3 of total e coli in the sewage on that occasion were due to the contribution of a single or a small group of individuals if so the magnitude of those ndm measurements could give a hint about which signals could be directly impacted by carriers infected at the hospital and which are due to background that indeed could be a result of indirect delayed impact by carriers infected individual as discussed above the highest observed levels of bla oxa 48 like positive e coli were on par to what one can expect to find for ctx m group1 producing e coli in the sewage samples a previous analysis of the same sewage samples from 2016 showed 5 5 of the e coli in the sewage to be esbl producers hutinel et al 2019 and a preceding study showed that 75 of the esbl producing e coli from urine samples in the local region were positive for bla ctx m group1 helldal et al 2013 our findings of similar levels of oxa 48 like and ctx m producers in the sewage is also supported by the relatively similar levels of bla oxa 48 like and bla ctx m genes as measured by qpcr in the current study the carrier rate for esbl producing e coli is around 5 in sweden ny et al 2017 but bla oxa 48 like positive cpe are reported to be much less common swedres svarm 2019 the sewage levels of bla oxa 48 like positive cpe during the peak could thus represent rather significant undetected transmission of cpe at the hospital alternatively and as discussed above it cannot be excluded that repeated shedding from an environmental biofilm is responsible for the observed peak there might also be other explanations behind the high cpe levels in the sewage samples a sampling bias and or presence of a selective pressure could possibly skew the bacterial populations in the sewage samples kraupner et al 2021 since the distance between the sewage sampling point and the source is relatively short there is limited time for the fecal material to be properly suspended and thus a risk for collecting lumps containing many bacteria from the same individual this would lead to overrepresentation of certain strains in the composite sample although this most likely happens from time to time when hospital sewage is collected like in the present study hutinel et al 2019 there is no obvious reason why it should happen on several consecutive occasions involving the same or closely related bacterial strains a selection pressure promoting antibiotic resistance and thus the detected cpe could also have explained the high levels during the peak however in a previous study where resistance to a broad panel of antibiotics was determined for e coli isolates from the very same sewage samples included in the present study none of the samples from the beginning of 2016 displayed exceptionally high resistance rates hutinel et al 2019 in fact one of the samples with high cpe abundance march 22 was actually one of two samples where the overall lowest resistance rates were observed for collected e coli isolates including low resistance to beta lactam antibiotics several earlier studies at hospitals have also identified sewage cpe strains not detected in patients a study at a us hospital included whole genome comparisons between cpe isolates as well as other carbapenemase producing bacteria from patient and environmental including sewage samples weingarten et al 2018 although closely related cpe 99 9 ani were detected in patient and sewage samples the great majority of detected sewage cpe strains were not detected in samples from patients similar observations that majority of hospital sewage cpe are not matched by strains from patients have also been done by white et al and koh et al koh et al 2015 white et al 2016 in these studies the sewage cpe collections have been dominated by species not representing the most commonly detected cpe species in patients where e coli and k pneumoniae usually dominate by focusing on the most clinically important cpe species the sewage monitoring might be more relevant from a clinical perspective such more species restricted comparisons have shown clear resemblance between esbl producing strains which have a similar epidemiology as corresponding cpe from sewage and patients drieux et al 2016 jørgensen et al 2017 zarfel et al 2013 on the other hand narrowing the scope might imply a risk of neglecting something that could be a threat albeit an unusual one apart from when sewage cpe are not detected in samples from patients the present and previous studies koh et al 2015 weingarten et al 2018 also include reversed observations cpe strains detected in the clinic but not observed in the sewage samples the major reason for this is probably shortcomings in the frequency of sewage sampling with regard to collection of both composite samples and subsamples although the present study included sewage sampling during more than two years none of the samplings apart from when ndm producing cpe matching patient isolates were detected april 2017 occurred in close connection to less than two weeks after any of the cpe detections in the clinic other reasons could be 1 that the colonized patient does not defecate during hospitalization or 2 that the nature of infection does not lead to release of cpe to sewage given that cpe infections often originate from the gut flora and most patients can be expected to defecate during hospitalization it should be possible to capture a large proportion of the cpe strains in admitted patients by applying frequent sewage sampling continuous collection of composite sewage samples 5 conclusions this study shows connections between both carbapenemase genes and cpe detected in hospital sewage and cpe identified in patients by combining culture and gene based analyses we conclude that bla oxa 48 like bla ndm and bla kpc could be indicative of corresponding cpe in sewage whereas the link between bla imp and bla vim detection and presence of cpe is much more uncertain detection of the two latter genes can still indicate presence of carbapenemases in other relevant pathogens though since also the former three genes can be found in non enterobacterales bacteria pcr detections needs to be confirmed by cultivation data or another methodology that can assign the detected gene to its host especially if assays are applied to samples from a new site overall the results of the present study at a single site shows promise for using sewage monitoring which has the capacity to screen bacteria from considerably more individuals compared to classical clinical surveillance as an early warning and surveillance system for rare forms of resistance yet additional validation is needed ideally through studies including culture and gene based approaches as well as extensive whole genome sequencing at hospitals where different abundance of carriers infected individuals is to be expected and where continuous and frequent sampling of sewage as well as patients can be conducted during the study period after such successful validation the resource efficient sewage based surveillance approach could have a significant value not only in the large parts of the world where continuous surveillance of antibiotic resistance is lacking but also in settings with relatively extended surveillance including fecal screening programmes of selected patient groups declaration of competing interest the

16942,carbapenemase producing enterobacterales cpe constitute a significant threat to healthcare systems continuous surveillance is important for the management and early warning of these bacteria sewage monitoring has been suggested as a possible resource efficient complement to traditional clinical surveillance it should not least be suitable for rare forms of resistance since a single sewage sample contains bacteria from a large number of individuals here the value of sewage monitoring in early warning of cpe was assessed at the sahlgrenska university hospital in gothenburg sweden a setting with low prevalence of cpe twenty composite hospital sewage samples were collected during a two year period carbapenemase genes in the complex samples were analyzed by quantitative pcr and the cpe loads were assessed through cultures on cpe selective agar followed by species determination as well as phenotypic and genotypic tests targeting carbapenemases of presumed cpe the findings were related to cpe detected in hospitalized patients a subset of cpe isolates from sewage and patients were subjected to whole genome sequencing for three of the investigated carbapenemase genes bla ndm bla oxa 48 like and bla kpc there was concordance between gene levels and abundance of corresponding cpe in sewage for the other two analyzed genes bla vim and bla imp there was no such concordance most likely due to the presence of those genes in non enterobacterales populating the sewage samples in line with the detection of oxa 48 like and ndm producing cpe in sewage these were also the most commonly detected cpe in patients ndm producing cpe were detected on a single occasion in sewage and isolated strains were shown to match strains detected in a patient a marked peak in cpe producing oxa 48 like enzymes was observed in sewage during a few months when levels started to increase there were no known cases of such cpe at the hospital but soon after a few cases were detected in samples from patients the oxa 48 like producing cpe from sewage and patients represented different strains but they carried similar bla oxa 48 like harbouring mobile genetic elements in conclusion sewage analyses show both promise and limitations as a complement to traditional clinical resistance surveillance for early warning of rare forms of resistance further evaluation and careful interpretation are needed to fully assess the value of such a sewage monitoring system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater epidemiology cpe carbapenemase antibiotic resistance hospital sewage 1 introduction a significant contributing factor to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance is the continuous emergence of novel resistance factors in pathogens via horizontal gene transfer one such example is carbapenemase producing enterobacterales cpe which have spread globally during the 21st century logan and weinstein 2017 pitout et al 2019 while cpe are commonly detected in clinical samples in many countries they are still rare in other parts of the world including the nordic countries ecdc 2019 up to date local surveillance is a cornerstone for the management of antibiotic resistance in particular for informing empirical treatment before the resistance profile of an infectious agent is determined resistance surveillance can also guide other management actions for example by serving as an early warning system for emerging and still rare forms of resistance including detection of asymptomatic carriage to be informative surveillance data therefore needs to be based on samples from a large number of individuals which not only include clinical cultures but also screening cultures to detect carriers as this is highly resource demanding and in the case of fecal screening can be questioned also from an ethical perspective nijsingh et al 2020 sewage analyses have emerged as a possible attractive complement to traditional clinical surveillance since a single sewage sample can contain bacteria from thousands of individuals aarestrup and woolhouse 2020 huijbers et al 2019 recently resistance rates in sewage and clinical escherichia coli isolates have been shown to correlate huijbers et al 2020 hutinel et al 2019 in these studies the isolation of sewage e coli was conducted using non selective agar i e no addition of antibiotics this gives the possibility to assess resistance rates for a wide panel of antibiotics including various co resistance patterns in an un biased way the approach is however not suitable for studying rare forms of resistance for these purposes methodologies more efficient in screening large numbers of bacteria in the sewage samples could be applied such as cultivation on selective plates or sensitive pcr analyses of total dna extracted from the samples in support of a pcr based approach a recent pcr array based study showed that antibiotic resistance gene abundance in sewage could reflect differences in clinical resistance patterns across europe parnanen et al 2019 to assess the value of sewage analyses in early warning of rare resistance threats we here aimed to analyze carbapenemase genes and cpe in hospital sewage and relate those observations to cpe in samples from the corresponding hospitalized population we also aimed to investigate if pcr based sewage analyses could provide similar information as the more resource demanding culture based approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study setting and cpe isolates from patients confirmed cpe cases are still rare in sweden cpe are notifiable according to swedish law and during 2015 2017 the total number of detected cases nationwide was 413 and 85 were either bla oxa 48 like or bla ndm harboring bacteria mostly imported cases detected through targeted fecal screening swedres svarm 2019 the study was conducted at the sahlgrenska university hospital in gothenburg which is the largest hospital in sweden 1950 beds with approximately 450 000 patient days year during the study period anonymized information regarding all confirmed cases with cpe at the hospital during the study period was provided by the infection control unit cpe were detected either in screening samples or in samples taken due to clinical signs of infection the clinical microbiology laboratory analyzed approximately 14 000 urine samples and 11 000 blood cultures from patients at the main site of the hospital on a yearly basis approximately 2000 fecal rectal screening samples were analyzed each year for the presence of multidrug resistant bacteria including cpe fecal rectal screening of patients is part of the hospital infection control program stating that all patients hospitalized abroad within the preceding year and patients carrying certain risk factors e g diarrhea or urinary catheter in combination with a refugee status should be screened for cpe at or just prior to admission screened once in addition patients at certain units e g hematology and transplantation are also screened on admission patient samples received at the clinical microbiology laboratory for diagnostic purposes of possible clinical infections were analyzed according to routine clinical microbiology practice including the use of maldi tof for species identification for antibiotic susceptibility testing the disk diffusion method and breakpoints according to eucast s recommendations at the time were used gram negative isolates were subjected to meropenem susceptibility testing either directly or following detection of cephalosporin or amoxicillin clavulanic acid resistance isolates non susceptible to meropenem using the eucast screening breakpoint for cpe detection were screened for bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla kpc bla imp and bla vim and bla ges by pcr monteiro et al 2012 samples obtained through patient screening stool or rectal swabs were plated on drigalski agar a selective media for gram negative bacteria in the presence of an ertapenem disk placed in the primary streak the plates were incubated at 37 up to 42 h read daily no prior enrichment culture was used all colonies with differing morphologies in a sample with decreased susceptibility to ertapenem zone diameter 28 mm were tested further for the detection of cpe as outlined above 2 2 sewage samples a total of twenty composite sewage samples were collected from april 2015 to august 2017 at a sampling point 57 40 52 1 n 11 57 31 4 e where raw sewage from the great majority of the main hospital site is collected each sample was collected over 24 h in a time proportional manner i e a subsample was collected every ninth minute samples were refrigerated during the sampling procedure and after being collected the composite samples were processed within three hours from being collected 2 3 relative quantification of carbapenemase genes in sewage samples by quantitative pcr total dna was isolated from each composite sewage samples by passing 40 ml through 0 45 µm pore size filters applying a vacuum manifold before using a powerwater dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna concentrations were measured with a qubit fluorometer invitrogen carlsbad ca using quantitative pcr qpcr the carbapenemase genes bla ndm bla oxa 48 like including e g bla oxa 48 bla oxa 181 and bla oxa 244 bla kpc bla imp and bla vim as well as the esbl gene bla ctx m group 1 including e g bla ctx m 15 were quantified using 16s as a reference gene all pcr reactions were run in 96 well plates by mixing 2 µl sewage dna with 10 µl 2 power sybr green pcr master mix applied biosystems carlsbad ca and 0 5 um of pcr primers eurofins genomics ebersberg germany table s1 in a total volume of 20 µl standard amplification conditions described for the 7500 real time pcr system were used and all reactions were run in duplicates dna from k pneumoniae ccug60138 bla ndm k pneumoniae ccug60138 bla ndm k pneumoniae h080820413 bla oxa 48 k pneumoniae ccug56233 bla kpc p aeruginosa ccug59626 or k44 24 bla imp k pneumoniae ccug58547 bla vim and e coli 10 36051a bla ctx m 15 prepared with the dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen hilden germany was used as positive controls the pcr efficiency for each primer pair was in the range of 1 9 2 0 when using standard curves prepared by dna from positive controls alone and for bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla kpc and bla vim also when the standard curves were prepared by diluting the positive control dna in complex dna from a sewage sample negative for the carbapenemase genes the latter test could not be performed for the other genes since they were ubiquitous in the sewage samples to further ensure limited interference by pcr inhibitors hospital sewage dna was analyzed at three different quantities resulting in 10 5 and 2 5 ng dna in the final reactions for the analysis of the 16s gene the dna was 64 fold more diluted than for the analyses of carbapenemase genes due to the very high 16s abundance the differences in the dilution of dna were adjusted for before the formula 2ct 16s ct target was used to calculate the abundance of the different target genes following detection in sewage samples pcr amplicons from at least one selected sample per gene were purified by using the qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen hilden germany and confirmed to correspond to the target genes by sanger sequencing eurofins genomics 2 4 bacterial cultures sewage samples were serially diluted in 0 85 nacl solution before 100 µl aliquots of the 10 1 10 2 and 10 3 dilutions were used to inoculate chromagar ecc plates chromagar paris france in triplicates cpe selective plates ecc supplemented with meropenem 0 25 µg ml and chromid oxa 48 biomerieux marcy l étoile france were inoculated with 100 µl and 500 µl of the undiluted samples in triplicates samples from 2015 were not cultured on ecc meropenem plates all agar plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h before colonies were counted blue and pink colonies on ecc plates non selective were counted to assess the total number of e coli and other coliforms respectively blue and pink colonies on ecc meropenem and chromid oxa 48 were regarded as presumptive cpe out of these the blue colonies on ecc meropenem and the pink colonies on chromid oxa 48 plates were presumed to be e coli whereas the remaining were presumed to be other coliforms 2 5 species determination of collected sewage isolates from cpe selective plates up to twenty colonies of both presumed e coli and presumed other coliforms per plate type and sample were randomly collected and subjected to species determination by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry maldi tof ms using the vitek ms system biomerieux in an earlier study 99 7 of the blue colonies on ecc plates inoculated with the type of sewage samples used here were confirmed to be e coli by maldi tof ms hutinel et al 2019 to assess the number of colonies corresponding to other species on cpe selective plates the total count of the non e coli coliform population was multiplied with the relative abundance of the species within that subpopulation according to maldi tof ms analyses 2 6 detection of carbapenemase activity in collected sewage isolates by carba np test for each sample if available five to ten isolates of both e coli and other coliforms confirmed by maldi tof ms from both chromid oxa 48 and ecc meropenem plates were subjected to carba np test according to dortet et al dortet et al 2014 k pneumoniae ccug60138 or ccug68728 both bla ndm and k pneumoniae ccug64452 bla oxa 48 were used as positive controls whereas k pneumoniae ccug59346 bla ampc overexpression and k pneumoniae ccug59359 bla tem 52 served as negative controls 2 7 detection of carbapenemase genes in collected sewage isolates by pcr the isolates subjected to carba np test were also screened for carbapenemase genes by pcr total dna was isolated from the strains using the dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen and eluted in 100 µl provided ae buffer the pcr reactions consisted of 0 625 u amplitaq polymerase 2 5

activation step at 94 c for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 55 c 60 c for blakpc for 30 s and 72 c for 40 s before a final elongation step at 72 c for 7 min using a geneamp pcr system 9700 applied biosystems the same carbapenemase harboring strains that served as positive controls for the real time pcr assays were used as controls also here 2 8 whole genome sequencing based on species and carbapenemase gene content whole genome sequencing was conducted for sewage and patient isolates with similar profiles the sequenced isolates 33 from eight sewage samples and nine from six patients were each given an id that starts with an s sewage or p patient followed by the collection date yymmdd and ends with a running number total dna was prepared from the isolates using the dneasy

paired end reads sewage and patient isolates that were most similar to each other based on sequence type st and or tentative carbapenemase harboring plasmid content information retrieved from illumina sequencing were additionally subjected to long read sequencing in order to allow more complete assembly of the genomes this was after isolation of total dna with qiagen genomic tips 500 g conducted via either single molecule real time sequencing technology smrt on the pacbio platform pacific biosciences menlo park ca or oxford nanopore technolgy on a minion using the rapid barcoding kit sqk rbk004 and a flo min106 flowcell the raw sequencing data was submitted to the sequence read archive and connected to bioproject prjna701733 2 9 sequence analyses the short reads from illumina sequencing were used in the genome assembly of all isolates first the quality of the reads was assessed using fastqc andrews 2010 then paired end reads with low quality bases were trimmed to reach a score of 20 and single reads with less than 20 bases in length were filtered using trim galore krueger 2012 the remaining paired end and single reads were assembled into longer contigs using spades with following parameters careful k 21 33 55 77 99 127 bankevich et al 2012 in order to assist the selection of isolates for long read sequencing the contigs were mapped to known sequenced plasmids from ncbi genome database downloaded 13 july 2018 using mummer 3 0 delcher et al 2003 the long reads generated subsequently for a subset of the isolates were combined with short reads to produce longer and more accurate contigs using a hybrid assembly approach long reads produced by minion were basecalled using guppy v3 4 5 in high accuracy mode guppy was also used to demultiplex and trim the barcodes from the reads nanoplot v1 29 1 was used to assess their quality de coster et al 2018 the short and long reads produced either on the pacbio or minion platorm were combined into hybrid assemblies using unicycler v0 4 8 in conservative mode wick et al 2017 the st of the isolates were identified as follows first the data related to species of interest i e e coli achtman scheme and k pneumoniae pasteur scheme were downloaded from the databases of allelic profiles and sequences on pubmlst https pubmlst org data accessed 1 december 2020 then contigs were searched against them using the blastn algorithm in the blast package camacho et al 2009 the presence of an exact and complete set of genes was assessed for each isolate and the corresponding st was reported open reading frames orfs on contigs were predicted using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 before diamond v0 9 24 buchfink et al 2015 was used to search orfs against resfinder database downloaded 1 december 2020 zankari

isolates plasmids was also estimated by calculating the two way average nucleotide identity ani goris et al 2007 with ani calculator http enve omics ce gatech edu ani blastn was used for the alignment of the nucleotide sequences altschul et al 1990 2 10 statistical analysis pearson s coefficient was used to evaluate correlation between growth on chromid oxa 48 plates and levels of bla oxa 48 like in sewage significance of the correlation coefficient was assessed by t test using the graphpad prism software graphpad software inc san diego ca 3 results 3 1 cpe isolated from patients during the more than two year long study period cpe were only isolated from seven patients hospitalized in wards contributing to the sewage at the sampling point a patient from which cpe was isolated at a nearby hospital within two weeks after the patient was cared but not screened at the studied hospital was also included in the study in total e coli and or k pneumoniae isolates positive for bla oxa 48 bla ndm and bla vim were detected in specimens from four four and one patient s respectively as shown in table 1 3 2 carbapenemase genes in sewage samples the bla oxa 48 like gene was detected in 19 of 20 analyzed sewage samples using qpcr after being detected at low levels in the first samples from 2015 a clear peak was seen in the end of that year and the beginning of 2016 fig 1 levels of bla oxa 48 like varied more than 1000 fold this should be compared to the relatively stable levels observed for bla ctx m varied 15 fold which was included as comparison in contrast to bla oxa 48 like the bla ndm gene was only detected in the sewage sample from april 2017 fig 1 among the other investigated carbapenemase genes bla kpc was not detected in any of the samples whereas bla vim and bla imp were detected in 18 and 19 samples respectively bla imp was not analyzed in one of the samples fig 1 the levels of bla vim varied more than 1000 fold bla imp was consistently detected at relatively high levels and varied less 20 fold 3 3 cpe in sewage samples cultivation on two different selective plates revealed presence of presumptive cpe in all but two of the analyzed sewage samples fig 2 subsequent genotypic and phenotypic analyses of collected isolates detected oxa 48 like and ndm producing cpe but no cpe producing kpc vim or imp tables 2 and 3 3 3 1 chromid oxa 48 plates when cultured on chromid oxa 48 plates presumptive e coli and non e coli coliforms were detected in all but three and two sewage samples respectively fig 2a and b all presumed e coli analyzed by maldi tof ms were verified to be e coli n 92 tables 2 and s2 out of 45 e coli isolates that were further analyzed 44 were pcr positive for bla oxa 48 like and 39 were positive in the carba np test tables 3 and s3 the great majority of the presumed non e coli coliforms were identified as k pneumoniae 122 149 the remaining were identified as either raoultella spp or serratia spp which were detected in two sewage samples each tables 2 and s2 all 64 further tested k penumoniae and raoultella isolates harbored oxa 48 like genes and 59 of them were also positive in the carba np test all ten further tested serratia marcescens isolates were negative for the five investigated carbapenemase genes tested by pcr as well as in the carbanp test tables 3 and s3 in accordance with the qpcr analyses a peak in growth on the chromid oxa 48 plates for both e coli and other coliform was observed in the beginning of 2016 with much higher levels than observed in the previous samples fig 2a and b also in line with the qpcr data was the non detection of oxa 48 like producing cpe in the sewage sample from february 2017 consequently a significant correlation was observed between bla oxa 48 like abundance and the total growth of e coli k pneumoniae and raoultella spp on chromid oxa 48 plates fig 3 3 3 2 ecc meropenem plates cultivation of sewage samples on ecc meropenem plates showed the presence of presumptive cpe in all but one of the analyzed samples samples from 2015 were not analyzed on this media fig 2c and d again it was the sample from february 2017 that was negative also in parallel with what was seen on chromid oxa 48 plates the highest counts for presumptive e coli was seen in the beginning of 2016 and all tested isolates were verified to be e coli by maldi tof ms n 130 tables 2 and s2 of the 72 e coli isolates subjected to further analyses 60 were positive in the carbanp test and 63 were positive for any of the screened carbapenemase genes 57 bla oxa 48 positive and six bla ndm positive tables 3 and s3 all bla ndm carrying e coli were isolated from the april 2017 sample the sample in which bla ndm was detected by qpcr all tested presumed non e coli coliforms from the ecc meropenem plates were confirmed by maldi tof ms tables 2 and s2 hence only enterobacterales spp were identified among the isolates collected from both types of cpe selective agar plates k pneumoniae were like on chromid oxa 48 plates commonly detected on ecc meropenem media not least in the beginning of 2016 as well as after cultivation of the sample from april 2017 however in contrast to what was observed on chromid oxa 48 plates the non e coli coliform population on ecc meropenem plates was dominated by other species than k pneumoniae and included enterobacter spp raoultella spp and klebsiella oxytoca among the 61 isolates from the ecc meropenem plates subjected to further analyses a carbapenemase gene could be detected by pcr in almost all 13 14 of the k pneumoniae and the single k oxytoca isolate tables 3 and s3 again bla oxa 48 like was the most commonly detected gene the bla ndm gene was detected in k pneumoniae isolates from the sample that also harbored ndm producing e coli april 2017 twelve of the klebsiella isolates were carbanp positive in sharp contrast almost all of the tested enterobacter 38 39 and raoultella 6 7 isolates were negative both in the carbanp test and the pcr based carbapenemase screening indicating the carriage of other non targeted resistance mechanisms which allowed them to grow on ecc meropenem plates tables 3 and s3 although presumptive non e coli cpe were detected in all but one of the samples analyzed on ecc meropenem plates pcr and carba np tests could not identify any cpe in five of the samples may june september and december 2016 as well as may 2017 only one of the five isolates analyzed from the august 2017 sample was confirmed to be cpe for these six samples none of the collected isolates were k pneumoniae whereas k pneumoniae was always detected among collected isolates from the other samples in summary the detection of carbapenemase gene carrying k pneumoniae on ecc meropenem plates followed the same pattern as observed for e coli highest levels in the beginning of 2016 due to bla oxa 48 like positive strains and in the sample from april 2017 due to bla ndm positive strains on the other sampling occasions with the exception of march 2017 the non e coli coliform population on ecc meropenem plates was dominated by strains that could not be confirmed to be cpe 3 4 comparisons of findings in sewage and patients carbapenemase genes detected in sewage cpe were restricted to bla oxa 48 like and bla ndm which also were the most common carbapenemase genes in cpe from patients when the levels of bla oxa 48 like and corresponding cpe in sewage increased dramatically in the end of 2015 no patients with cpe were detected however during or soon after the observed peak in sewage three patients number 3 4 and 5 in table 1 with the same type of cpe regarding species and carbapenemase gene were identified february may 2016 one additional case was detected in july 2017 in close connection to the detection of bla ndm positive cpe in sewage samples this type of cpe was detected in a patient sample april 2017 cpe carrying bla ndm were also detected in three additional patients none of these samples were taken within two weeks of a sewage sampling 3 4 1 whole genome sequencing of blaoxa 48 like positive cpe all sequenced bla oxa 48 like positive sewage isolates carried the bla oxa 48 gene and all but one collected on seven sampling occasions were e coli st2450 n 12 or k pneumoniae st147 n 12 table s4 one bla oxa 48 carrying sewage e coli isolate s 160622 2 was st38 none of the sequenced bla oxa 48 like positive isolates from patients of which three were shown to carry bla oxa 48 two to carry bla oxa 181 and one to carry bla oxa 244 belonged to any of these sts table s4 however the isolates from patient 4 as well as all the e coli st2450 and k pneumoniae st147 sewage isolates seemed to carry related plasmids since contigs from their short read assemblies covered the majority of pe71t genbank kc335143 a 64 kilo base pair bla oxa 48 harboring incl plasmid power et al 2014 and other poxa 48a like plasmids pitout et al 2019 poirel et al 2012 long read sequencing confirmed that the patient and sewage isolates contained bla oxa 48 plasmids closely related to poxa 48a like plasmids including pe71t 99 95 99 98 ani the three isolates from patient 4 carried very similar incl plasmids harboring the blaoxa 48 gene in a tn1999 2 composite transposon table s4 pitout et al 2019 power et al 2014 the two k pneumoniae isolates p 160217 1 and p 160405 2 collected on different dates from that patient were the same strain 100 ani and carried the exact same blaoxa 48 plasmid the e coli isolated from the same patient p 160405 1 carried a bla oxa 48 plasmid with 99 98 nucleotide identity to the one of the k pneumoniae isolates although overall very closely related to plasmids from patient 4 99 96 99 98 ani the blaoxa 48 carrying plasmids of sewage isolates subjected to long read sequencing had slightly different structures the blaoxa 48 plasmids of two sewage isolates s 160113 4 and s 160121 1 contained a 135 base pair segment in an already interrupted gene coding for a dna primase which was not present in the plasmids from patient 4 additionally the orientation of tn1999 2 was inverted in s 160113 4 and in s 160121 1 the blaoxa 48 was in a tn1999 composite transposon which lacks the is1r element present in tn1999 2 pitout et al 2019 poirel et al 2012 long read sequencing also revealed another mobile genetic element mge containing bla oxa 48 like for which close resemblance between clinical and sewage isolates was evident in s 160622 2 the only sewage e coli isolate of a divergent st st38 table s4 the bla oxa 48 gene was chromosomally located in a truncated tn1999 2 which is embedded in the composite transposon tn6237 100 identity with genbank kt444705 pitout et al 2019 turton et al 2016 an almost identical chromosomally located composite transposon was detected in the clinical e coli isolate p 160213 1 the transposon in the clinical isolate only differed by one nucleotide which changed the bla oxa 48 gene to bla oxa 244 3 4 2 whole genome sequencing of blandm positive cpe all six sequenced bla ndm positive sewage e coli isolates belonged to st694 whereas the two sequenced bla ndm positive sewage k pneumoniae isolates belonged to different sts 307 and unknown among the four sequenced bla ndm positive isolates from patients two were of the same sts as the sewage isolates table s4 these strains were isolated from the same patient in close connection to the collection of the bla ndm positive sewage isolates and were e coli st694 p 170419 1 and k pneumoniae st307 p 170419 2 all five bla ndm positive isolates subjected to long read sequencing carried the carbapenemase gene on very similar 83 kilo base pair incm2 plasmids table s4 the sewage e coli s 170425 2 and s 170425 6 were the same strain as the patient isolate p 170419 1 100 ani and carried identical bla ndm1 harboring plasmids the sewage k pneumoniae s 170425 8 was the same strain as the patient isolate p 170419 2 100 ani and carried a bla ndm1 harboring plasmid differing from the one of the e coli isolates by only six nucleotides including four nucleotides changing bla ctx m 28 found on the e coli plasmid into bla ctx m 3 in k pneumoniae table s4 4 discussion this study investigates if detection of carbapenemase genes and cpe in hospital sewage samples can provide information on the presence of such bacteria among admitted patients the majority of the characterized sewage cpe or the carbapenemase harboring mges they carried showed apparent relation to cpe detected in patient samples for three of the five investigated carbapenemase genes qpcr analyses provided similar information regarding abundance of corresponding sewage cpe as culture based analyses we will below scrutinize the results and discuss the evidence for using sewage analyses as an early warning and surveillance system for cpe over the study period there was detection of bla oxa 48 like positive cpe in most sewage samples of bla ndm positive cpe on a single occasion and no detection of bla kpc positive cpe this qualitatively reflected what was observed in patient samples from the studied hospital i e detection of cpe producing oxa 48 like and or ndm but none producing kpc the findings of cpe in sewage were also clearly matched by the carbapenemase gene specific qpcr analyses of the complex sewage samples hence there was a good accordance between abundance of genes and corresponding types of cpe in the sewage samples for the three carbapenemase genes most frequently detected in isolates from patients in all of sweden swedres svarm 2019 the two additional carbapenemase genes included in this study bla vim and bla imp were detected in the majority of sewage samples but not in any of the collected cpe isolates although high qpcr signals were detected for both genes in contrast to the other three these two genes are often carried in the form of integron gene cassettes and are as such widespread in several non enterobacterales species logan and weinstein 2017 hence the qpcr detection of these genes in the present study is likely due to the presence of bla vim bla imp harboring strains of non enterobacterales species in the sewage and would thus be less informative regarding the presence and early warning of cpe however it should be acknowledged that non enterobacterales hosts have been described also for bla ndm walsh et al 2011 bla kpc villegas et al 2007 and bla oxa 48 like genes meunier et al 2016 tacão et al 2018 in addition to having the potential to provide qualitative information about cpe in the contributing population the sewage analyses also provide quantitative measurements that might inform about cpe prevalence in order to serve as an appropriate surveillance and early warning system an increased sewage signal should indicate increased prevalence in the contributing population this was clearly seen for bla ndm positive cpe when the single sewage detection coincided with detection of such cpe in a patient sample in addition three of the four patients known to carry be infected with bla oxa 48 like positive cpe were detected during the beginning of 2016 when there was a dramatic peak of such cpe in the sewage other studies have also shown similar repertoires of cpe in sewage and patient samples a screening of samples from twenty wastewater treatment plants in the east of england could detect cpe that based on species and carbapenemase genes largely mirrored what was found in samples from patients ludden et al 2017 in addition an analysis of sewage sampled across israel could observe that the most commonly detected cpe types matched those in the clinic meir gruber et al 2016 in neither of these two studies a comparison between wastewater and patient isolates beyond species and carbapenemase genes was conducted in the present study whole genome sequencing showed that bla ndm positive strains isolated from sewage were almost identical to cpe strains from a patient emphasizing that what we observe in the sewer can inform about the situation in the clinical setting several earlier studies have also shown identically typed cpe in patients and sewage sewage contaminated water khan et al 2018 lepuschitz et al 2019 mahon et al 2017 however the sequenced bla oxa 48 like positive sewage strains in the current study differed from those identified in patients although they carried closely related bla oxa 48 like harboring mobile genetic elements all of the bla oxa 48 like harboring elements detected in sewage were related to such found in cpe from patients a likely at least partial explanation for finding some cpe strains in sewage but not in patients could be that although a screening program is in place cpe carriers might remain undetected only a minor fraction of the patients are screened for cpe and generally only once i e at or just prior to admission none of the visitors and staff are screened if carriers do not develop subsequent infection with cpe which based on studies of patients carrying esbl producing enterobacterales at the hospital can be presumed to be very rare lindblom et al 2018 it would further prevent detection of cpe in the clinical setting thus the bla oxa 48 like carrying strains in the sewage might represent a silent outbreak at the hospital the marked increase during a few consecutive months fits this hypothesis the dramatic increase in bla oxa 48 like positive cpe and bla oxa 48 like genes in the sewage during the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016 also matches the evident increase in number of such cpe cases in patients on a national level in sweden during those years swedres svarm 2019 repeated shedding into the sewage from another source such as environmental biofilms containing cpe could possibly also contribute to the observed peak in sewage bla oxa 48 like positive cpe in a recent investigation of biofilms in the main sewer at a french hospital carbapenemase producing bacteria were detected but no cpe ory et al 2019 in contrast weingarten and co workers isolated cpe from hospital wastewater pipe sludge and multiple studies have shown that hospital sinks can harbor cpe clarivet et al 2016 decraene et al 2018 kizny gordon et al 2017 regev yochay et al 2018 weingarten et al 2018 however even if the commonly detected oxa 48 producing sewage cpe in the present study represent strains thriving in the draining sewer systems it is likely that they or at least their plasmids have been introduced by the hospital population at an earlier time point it is striking that all but one of the sequenced oxa 48 producing sewage cpe isolates were either k pneumoniae st147 or e coli st2450 a finding that could support either of the abovementioned suggested explanations silent outbreak or repeated shedding from a source in the wastewater network similar explanations were recently suggested i e residency in the wastewater system and or circulation in the contributing community when two esbl positive e coli clones were repeatedly isolated from a wastewater pump station in a norwegian suburb paulshus et al 2019 on occasions when there is a non complete match between patient and sewage isolates but still detection of closely related mges carrying the relevant antibiotic resistance gene it could be a result of horizontal gene transfer between strains detected in patient and sewage samples the sharing of genetic material could in addition to within the patient s microbiome occur in the sewers or in the hospital environment connected to the sewage system such an event has earlier been postulated to have occurred in a sink drain at the hospital studied by weingarten et al weingarten et al 2018 in the present study closely related bla oxa 48 like carrying mges were detected in patient and sewage isolates however since those mges represent groups of closely related mges acting as main drivers behind the global spread of bla oxa 48 like genes pitout et al 2019 it is quite plausible that individuals other than the patients detected in this study were sources of the mges observed in sewage importantly the initial detection in sewage isolates occurred when there were still no known cpe cases at the hospital and thus preceded the detection in isolates from patient samples this suggests a value of sewage monitoring as an early warning system the evident increase in bla oxa 48 like positive cpe in the sewage during a few consecutive months also warrants some reflection with regard to the magnitude of that peak measured levels of bla oxa 48 like positive e coli were as high as a few percent of total e coli in the sewage samples and both qpcr signals and relative colony forming unit counts were up to 1000 fold higher than observations at other time points even though both constant changes in the hospitalized population and the risk for transmission of cpe between individuals are factors that could contribute to fluctuating levels of cpe prevalence it seems unlikely that the number of carriers infected at the hospital should vary that much a possible explanation could be that the low levels observed are due to bacteria released from biofilms in the sewers creating a background signal and that it is only the higher levels that correspond to direct detection of carriers at the hospital since we saw a perfect match between ndm producing strains in the sewage and strains from the single carrier detected in the clinic in april 2017 it is tempting to speculate that the ndm signals e g 0 3 of total e coli in the sewage on that occasion were due to the contribution of a single or a small group of individuals if so the magnitude of those ndm measurements could give a hint about which signals could be directly impacted by carriers infected at the hospital and which are due to background that indeed could be a result of indirect delayed impact by carriers infected individual as discussed above the highest observed levels of bla oxa 48 like positive e coli were on par to what one can expect to find for ctx m group1 producing e coli in the sewage samples a previous analysis of the same sewage samples from 2016 showed 5 5 of the e coli in the sewage to be esbl producers hutinel et al 2019 and a preceding study showed that 75 of the esbl producing e coli from urine samples in the local region were positive for bla ctx m group1 helldal et al 2013 our findings of similar levels of oxa 48 like and ctx m producers in the sewage is also supported by the relatively similar levels of bla oxa 48 like and bla ctx m genes as measured by qpcr in the current study the carrier rate for esbl producing e coli is around 5 in sweden ny et al 2017 but bla oxa 48 like positive cpe are reported to be much less common swedres svarm 2019 the sewage levels of bla oxa 48 like positive cpe during the peak could thus represent rather significant undetected transmission of cpe at the hospital alternatively and as discussed above it cannot be excluded that repeated shedding from an environmental biofilm is responsible for the observed peak there might also be other explanations behind the high cpe levels in the sewage samples a sampling bias and or presence of a selective pressure could possibly skew the bacterial populations in the sewage samples kraupner et al 2021 since the distance between the sewage sampling point and the source is relatively short there is limited time for the fecal material to be properly suspended and thus a risk for collecting lumps containing many bacteria from the same individual this would lead to overrepresentation of certain strains in the composite sample although this most likely happens from time to time when hospital sewage is collected like in the present study hutinel et al 2019 there is no obvious reason why it should happen on several consecutive occasions involving the same or closely related bacterial strains a selection pressure promoting antibiotic resistance and thus the detected cpe could also have explained the high levels during the peak however in a previous study where resistance to a broad panel of antibiotics was determined for e coli isolates from the very same sewage samples included in the present study none of the samples from the beginning of 2016 displayed exceptionally high resistance rates hutinel et al 2019 in fact one of the samples with high cpe abundance march 22 was actually one of two samples where the overall lowest resistance rates were observed for collected e coli isolates including low resistance to beta lactam antibiotics several earlier studies at hospitals have also identified sewage cpe strains not detected in patients a study at a us hospital included whole genome comparisons between cpe isolates as well as other carbapenemase producing bacteria from patient and environmental including sewage samples weingarten et al 2018 although closely related cpe 99 9 ani were detected in patient and sewage samples the great majority of detected sewage cpe strains were not detected in samples from patients similar observations that majority of hospital sewage cpe are not matched by strains from patients have also been done by white et al and koh et al koh et al 2015 white et al 2016 in these studies the sewage cpe collections have been dominated by species not representing the most commonly detected cpe species in patients where e coli and k pneumoniae usually dominate by focusing on the most clinically important cpe species the sewage monitoring might be more relevant from a clinical perspective such more species restricted comparisons have shown clear resemblance between esbl producing strains which have a similar epidemiology as corresponding cpe from sewage and patients drieux et al 2016 jørgensen et al 2017 zarfel et al 2013 on the other hand narrowing the scope might imply a risk of neglecting something that could be a threat albeit an unusual one apart from when sewage cpe are not detected in samples from patients the present and previous studies koh et al 2015 weingarten et al 2018 also include reversed observations cpe strains detected in the clinic but not observed in the sewage samples the major reason for this is probably shortcomings in the frequency of sewage sampling with regard to collection of both composite samples and subsamples although the present study included sewage sampling during more than two years none of the samplings apart from when ndm producing cpe matching patient isolates were detected april 2017 occurred in close connection to less than two weeks after any of the cpe detections in the clinic other reasons could be 1 that the colonized patient does not defecate during hospitalization or 2 that the nature of infection does not lead to release of cpe to sewage given that cpe infections often originate from the gut flora and most patients can be expected to defecate during hospitalization it should be possible to capture a large proportion of the cpe strains in admitted patients by applying frequent sewage sampling continuous collection of composite sewage samples 5 conclusions this study shows connections between both carbapenemase genes and cpe detected in hospital sewage and cpe identified in patients by combining culture and gene based analyses we conclude that bla oxa 48 like bla ndm and bla kpc could be indicative of corresponding cpe in sewage whereas the link between bla imp and bla vim detection and presence of cpe is much more uncertain detection of the two latter genes can still indicate presence of carbapenemases in other relevant pathogens though since also the former three genes can be found in non enterobacterales bacteria pcr detections needs to be confirmed by cultivation data or another methodology that can assign the detected gene to its host especially if assays are applied to samples from a new site overall the results of the present study at a single site shows promise for using sewage monitoring which has the capacity to screen bacteria from considerably more individuals compared to classical clinical surveillance as an early warning and surveillance system for rare forms of resistance yet additional validation is needed ideally through studies including culture and gene based approaches as well as extensive whole genome sequencing at hospitals where different abundance of carriers infected individuals is to be expected and where continuous and frequent sampling of sewage as well as patients can be conducted during the study period after such successful validation the resource efficient sewage based surveillance approach could have a significant value not only in the large parts of the world where continuous surveillance of antibiotic resistance is lacking but also in settings with relatively extended surveillance including fecal screening programmes of selected patient groups declaration of competing interest the

16943,thermal treatment is routinely used to reactivate the spent granular activated carbon gac from water purification facilities it is also an integral part of sewage sludge treatment and municipal solid waste management this study presents a detailed investigation of the fate of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and one pfas alternative genx in thermal processes focusing on the effect of gac we demonstrate that the thermolysis of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and genx can occur at temperatures of 150 200 c three temperature zones were discovered for pfoa including a stable and nonvolatile zone 90 c a phase transfer and thermal decomposition zone 90 400 c and a fast decomposition zone 400 c the thermal decomposition began with the homolysis of a c c bond next to the carboxyl group of pfcas which formed unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals dual decomposition pathways seem to exist the addition of a highly porous adsorbent such as gac or a copolymer resin compressed the intermediate sublimation zone of pfcas changed their thermal decomposition pathways and increased the decomposition rate constant by up to 150 fold at 250 c the results indicate that the observed thermal decomposition acceleration was linked to the adsorption of gas phase pfca molecules on gac the presence of non activated charcoals biochars with a low affinity for pfoa did not accelerate its thermal decomposition suggesting that the π electron rich polyaromatic surface of charcoal gac played an insignificant role compared to the adsorbent s porosity overall the results indicate that 1 substantial decomposition of pfcas and genx during conventional thermal gac sludge waste treatment is very likely and 2 the presence or addition of gac or

decomposition can perfluoroalkyl substances be thermally degraded at 200 c without the presence of gac if so how fast is this process does gac facilitate the thermal degradation of these compounds if yes what is the relative importance of the polyaromatic surface and the porosity of gac answering these questions has important implications for understanding the fate of pfas in thermal water wastewater sludge waste treatment processes two important structural features of porous pyrogenic carbonaceous materials pcms including gac are the porosity and polyaromatic units kah et al 2017 an

commonly known as biochar that has been modified such as to enhance its performance as an adsorbent in water and wastewater treatment the polyaromatic surface of both gac and biochar has been suggested to act as an electron shuttle accelerating the redox conversion of organic compounds kappler et al 2014 millerick et al 2013 tang et al 2011 another question arises whether charcoals biochars can alter the thermal degradation of pfas which has critical implications not only for fate transport studies of pfas under natural thermal conditions e g wildfires but for designing effective carbonaceous adsorbents for pfas this study was conducted to address the above questions and to better understand the thermal decomposition kinetics products and pathways of pfas focusing on

strynar et al 2015 xiao 2017 to confirm decomposition products reference standards of perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea and pfhpa were also prepared 2 2 thermal treatments t 1 the thermal decomposition of the studied pfas was performed in a closed borosilicate glass container xiao et al 2020 see the supplementary document in three conditions t 1 t 2 t 3 as shown in fig 1 before the thermal treatment in t 1 thermolysis a known quantity 1 2 10 5 mol or 0 005 g pfoa of pfas chemical powders or solution in the case of pfba and hfpo da was added into a pre cleaned container and air dried at 25 c the measurement of the weight or volume of pfas chemicals became less accurate below 1 2 10 5 mol of pfas the container with pfas was then capped with a ground glass stopper next we set a muffle furnace neytech vulcan 3 550 usa to a predetermined temperature 150 c 200 c 250 c 300 c or 400 c and then put the container with pfas inside the furnace for an isothermal treatment for up to 180 min after heat treatment and cooldown the container was added with distilled water dw or methanol amended with 100 mmol l ammonium acetate xiao et al 2020 and sonicated for 30 min concentrations of fluoride ions f in dw and residual pfas in methanol were determined see the supplementary document xiao et al 2020 and their masses m f and m pfas t mol were calculated in the manner described previously xiao et al 2020 our extraction method methanol with ammonium acetate achieved recoveries ranging from 80 4 to 111 8 for most of the pfas compounds involved in this study xiao et al 2020 concentrations of f were determined by the standard spadns method rice et al 2012 the analysis of pfas was carried out on a waters acquity ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography uplc system coupled with a waters high

treatment these porous adsorbents included gac filtrasorb 200 calgon carbon corporation pa raw charcoals n 4 and thermally air oxidized charcoals n 4 two charcoal samples were made from a cellulose rich feedstock maple wood at a heat treatment temperature of 350 c referred as m350 or 600 c m600 following a previously published procedure xiao and pignatello 2015a b another two charcoal samples were produced from a lignin rich feedstock pecan shells at a heat treatment temperature of 350 c p350 or 700 c p700 we also prepared porosity enhanced charcoals by oxidizing raw charcoals in air at 400 c for 30 min cao et al 2019 xiao and pignatello 2016 the surface areas sas of these pcms were measured with n2 at 77 k autosorb iq quantachrome boynton beach fl xiao et al 2019 and calculated by the 11 point brunauer emmett teller bet method in addition to these carbonaceous materials we also included a crosslinked polystyrene copolymer resin amberlite xad 2 sigma aldrich st louis mo as an adsorbent in a t 2 experiment finally to examine the possible effect of borosilicate glass a sample of pfoa was thermally treated along with five 2 ml borosilicate vials available sa 0 0027 m2 per vial to increase the available sa of the borosilicate glass container 0 025 m2 by 50 2 4 thermal treatments t 3 to prepare the thermal treatment in t 3 a pfas chemical was pre adsorbed to a porous adsorbent in water we could not conduct gas phase adsorption experiments because the thermal decomposition of pfca vapor is inevitable with increasing temperature to or above 150 c the test solution was prepared with distilled water containing 1 0 10 3 mol l nahco3 as a buffer and 1 0 10 3 mol l nacl the adsorption experiment was performed in 50 ml thermo scientific nunc sterile polypropylene vials rotated end over end at 10 rpm for four days at 22 c an apparent adsorption equilibrium was reached within four days after adsorption pfas laden adsorbent particles were split into two portions the first portion was freeze dried weighed and extracted using methanol v extr ml amended with 100 mmol l ammonium acetate nh4ac xiao et al 2020 to determine the mass before thermal treatment m pfas i the one point water adsorbent distribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the adsorbed concentration c s to the dissolved concentration at equilibrium c w k d w s c s c w the second portion of the pfas laden adsorbent particles was placed in a closed container and heated in an air environment within a muffle furnace neytech vulcan 3 550 usa at a predetermined temperature after heat treatment and cooldown the sample was processed in the same way as described above for the t 1 experiment 2 5 other thermal treatments we also performed thermal decomposition in the atmosphere of n2 in this experiment the sample to be heated was first placed into a container and purged with n2 for 15 min to remove air the container was then capped with a ground glass stopper and heated in the muffle furnace at a pre determined temperature in addition to isothermal treatment we also examined the decomposition of pfas in a dynamic thermal environment briefly a known quantity of pfoa pfos chemical powders was placed in a closed container and heated dynamically in the muffle furnace at a 10 c min heating rate this heating rate was used previously in the thermogravimetric analysis tga xiao et al 2020 after heat treatment and cooldown the samples were treated in the same manner as the t 1 experiment finally the thermal decomposition of pfoa xiao et al 2020 and pfos at low and moderate temperatures 500 c was investigated by means of a thermal desorption pyrolysis system cds analytical connected to a gas chromatograph with an ms detector td pyr gc ms agilent gc 7890 and 5975c ms santa clara ca see the supplementary data for more details 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal decomposition of pfas in three conditions we found that the thermal decomposition of pfas mostly followed first order kinetics at temperatures of 150 250 c in which the residual pfas mass m pfas t decreased in an exponential manner over heating time fig 1 at a higher temperature 300 c the decomposition of these chemicals can also be described by second order kinetics in which a plot of 1 m pfas t versus heating time is approximately linear for comparison purposes we used the first order decomposition rate constant k 1st min 1 in the following discussion the value of k 1st was below 0 005 min 1 for pfcas at 150 250 c in t 1 fig 2 pfeca hfpo da appears to be more easily degraded than the pfca with the same number of perfluorinated carbons i e pfba figs 1 and 2 this is consistent with our previous observation xiao et al 2020 that the perfluorinated chain becomes less thermally stable with the inclusion of a foreign group i e the ether group in hfpo da 3 2 effect of gac as illustrated in fig 2 gac accelerated the thermal decomposition of hfpo da at temperatures as low as 150 c in t 2 and t 3 conditions the gac induced acceleration was evident for pfcas at 200 c and up to a 60 fold increase in k 1st was observed t 2 and t 3 fig 2 this acceleration became even more significant at 250 c which led to a 150 fold increase in k 1st for pfunda fig 2 as displayed in fig 2 the acceleration effect was less pronounced for the short chain pfas pfba because the adsorption of pfba on gac was much weaker than that of its long chain homologues see fig s15 for adsorption isotherms of pfba hfpo da and pfoa on gac in the supplementary document the effect of gac became less marked at higher temperatures of 300 c and 400 c at which the significant thermolysis t 1 of pfcas was seen figs 1 and 2 a thermal treatment at 300 c in t 2 led to near complete decomposition 99 99 of pfoa within 60 min no attempt was made to maximize the thermal decomposition of pfcas a similar effect of gac was observed when the samples were heated anaerobically fig s16 of the supplementary data the k 1st of pfoa obtained in air was not significantly different from that obtained in n2 fig s16 because pfcea and pfca molecules were not pre adsorbed on gac in t 2 treatments we hypothesize that the accelerated decomposition was caused by the adsorption of gas phase pfcea pfca on gac that is much more thermally conductive 0 4 1 36 w m k than air 0 032 w m k at 100 c jin et al 2013 khaliji oskouei and tamainot telto 2019 the heat transfer is more efficient on gac than in air on the other hand the thermal conductivity of air increases with temperature at 400 c the effect of gac amendment on the thermal decomposition rate of pfas appears to be much less important 3 3 effect of other pcms and porous resin to test this hypothesis we conducted t 2 experiments with various pcms and one non carbonaceous material xad 2 resin the results are plotted as a function of the k d w s of pfoa fig 3 charcoals have a higher thermal conductivity 0 08 0 18 w m k behazin et al 2016 than air however raw charcoals are primarily microporous 20 å xiao and pignatello 2016 steric hindrance can result from narrow pore throats internal obstructions or pore blockage by occluded non covalently bound matter such as pyrolysis tars xiao and pignatello 2015a zhu et al 2005 the length of pfoa molecules is approximately 10 å xiao et al 2011 the steric bulk of pfoa molecules may limit their access to the interior micropore sa of raw charcoal that is available to n2 molecules therefore a low adsorption of pfoa on raw charcoals was observed fig 3 and the thermal decomposition of pfoa was not accelerated with the addition of a raw charcoal sample m350 m600 p350 or p700 the thermal air oxidation of raw charcoals caused pore wall etching and or unclogging of pores bearing tarry deposits generated during the carbonization step xiao et al 2017 xiao and pignatello 2016 this in turn widened pores of charcoal and created new sa which helped relieve steric hindrance for adsorption of pfoa molecules fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3 the thermal decomposition of pfoa increased significantly with the addition of a thermally air oxidized charcoal commercial porous materials gac or activated charcoal and xad 2 resin adsorbed pfoa strongly fig 3 reducing the thermal decomposition half life of pfoa from 400 min to less than 25 min at 200 c fig 3 the n2 b e t sa of the xad 2 resin 330 370 m2 g is lower than that of the thermally air oxidized m600 however the xad 2 resin is characterized by a broad pore size distribution and a mean pore size of 90 å mesopores 20 500 å have shown to be important for molecules to access deeper and smaller pores of adsorbents xiao and pignatello 2015a finally the borosilicate glass appeared to have no significant effect on the thermal decomposition of pfoa fig 3 3 4 thermal decomposition pathways pfcas yielded several transient intermediates at temperatures as low as 150 c figs 4 and s2 for a parent pfca with n perfluorinated carbons the highest yielding intermediate product is usually the shorter chained pfca with n 1 perfluorinated carbons figs 4 and s2 for example pfda yielded shorter chain pfcas in the following order pfna pfoa pfhpa pfpea pfba similarly the highest yielding byproduct of pfoa was pfhpa whereas pfba was a trace intermediate product this formation pattern seems to agree with the stepwise defluorination mechanism pathway ii in fig 5 that has been developed for photocatalysis wang et al 2008 reduction by hydrated electrons bentel et al 2019 and plasma singh et al 2019 treatments of pfas compounds however a closer look at the results reveals that it is not the predominant mechanism of the thermolysis of pfas first the yield of intermediate pfcas is low 5 mol during the t 1 treatment fig 4 second a clear stepwise pattern was not observed because all the short chain intermediates appeared nearly simultaneously figs 4 and s2 we propose a different thermal decomposition mechanism pathway i in fig 5 we believe thermal decomposition of pfas involves multistep radical chain reactions including initiation chain propagation recombination and termination xiao et al 2021 because of the strong c f bond we believe that the thermal decomposition of pfoa was initiated with the homolytic cleavage of the relatively weak c c bond located next to the carboxyl group of pfoa or the c s bond next to the sulfonate group of pfos the c c or c s bond splits forming a nonfluorinated moiety and a perfluoroalkyl biradical such as c7f14 m z 350 0 from pfoa or c8f16 m z 399 9 from pfos figs 6 and s4 the perfluoroalkyl radical further undergoes a series of defluorination or radical chain propagation reactions generating shorter chained perfluoroalkyl radicals fig 5 these perfluoroalkyl radicals may recombine with carboxyl group radical successively yielding pfca intermediates eventually these chain propagation reactions are terminated by producing the dead or very short fluorinated units in pathway i transient pfca intermediates are the minor product a number of intermediate perfluoroalkyl radicals species were identified fig s17 including cf3 m z 69 0 c3f3 m z 93 0 c2f4 m z 100 0 c2f5 m z 119 0 c3f5 m z 131 0 c3f7 m z 169 0 c4f7 m z 181 0 c5f9 m z 231 0 c6f11 m z 281 0 c7f13 m z 331 0 and c7f14 m z 350 0 many of these perfluoroalkyl radicals have also been observed in previous studies on the thermal treatment of pfos wang et al 2013 and perfluorocarbons kagramanov et al 1990 note that these species were detected by td pyr gc ms in an inert atmosphere helium at present our td pyr gc ms system is not able to operate in an air atmosphere however the general decomposition mechanism initiation chain propagation termination illustrated in fig 5 may also apply to the thermal treatment of pfas under active atmospheres it is evident that the presence of gac altered the decomposition pathway of pfcas significantly increasing yields of shorter chained pfca intermediates at 150 c figs 4 and s3 at 200 c the yield of pfna from pfda was maximized after a 30 min treatment in t 2 and then disappeared on the same time scale as the parent compound i e pfda figs 4 and s3 at a higher temperature 300 c the yield of pfna from pfda dropped to 10 mol after 5 min figs 4 and s3 and was negligibly low with a longer heating time as pfna quickly decomposed fig 1 previously no measurable shorter chained pfcas were detected after a 30 min thermal treatment of pfoa on gac at 400 c xiao et al 2020 3 5 effect of gac on the yield of f from pfoa the yield of f from pfoa during low temperature t 1 thermolysis 400 c remained less than 2 mol fig 6 the addition of gac t 2 significantly enhanced the yield of f fig 6a we observed a critical mass ratio of pfoa to gac 620 μmol pfoa ggac above which the effect of gac is insignificant in t 2 as the gac may become saturated with gas phase pfoa molecules fig 6b this ratio reflects a dynamic balance between the adsorption and thermal decomposition of gas state pfoa on the surface of gac it is more than one order of magnitude greater than the saturated adsorption amount 40 μmol pfoa ggac or the maximum adsorption capacity of the gac for pfoa in the liquid phase fig s15 3 6 three temperature zones according to dynamic decomposition results fig 7 three temperature zones can be recognized pfoa is stable and essentially nonvolatile at temperatures below 90 c zone a a rise in temperature above 90 c zone b triggers the phase transfer e g melting boiling sublimation of pfoa molecules xiao et al 2021 because of the rising vapor pressure kaiser et al 2005 pfoa molecules started to degrade in zone b when the temperature increased to 400 c or above zone c pfoa molecules were quickly degraded figs 2d and 7 the addition of gac compressed zone b and facilitated the thermal decomposition of pfoa pfos on the other hand is highly nonvolatile until 400 c xiao et al 2020 the thermal decomposition of pfos was not significantly affected with the presence of gac fig s18 4 conclusions the fate of pfas in thermal processes is poorly understood pfcas used as surface active agents in non stick cookware and fire fighting foams are generally assumed to be thermally stable at low temperatures 300 c contradictory to this prevailing view this study shows that the thermolysis of pfcas occurs at low temperatures of 150 200 c figs 2 and 4 albeit slowly we further demonstrated that the low temperature 150 300 c thermal decomposition of pfcas was accelerated by highly porous adsorbents the effect of gac is much less significant at 400 c at which the thermolysis of pfoa was markedly faster the results also indicate that 1 the n2 b e t sa of adsorbents is a poor predictor of the adsorption of pfoa molecules

16943,thermal treatment is routinely used to reactivate the spent granular activated carbon gac from water purification facilities it is also an integral part of sewage sludge treatment and municipal solid waste management this study presents a detailed investigation of the fate of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and one pfas alternative genx in thermal processes focusing on the effect of gac we demonstrate that the thermolysis of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and genx can occur at temperatures of 150 200 c three temperature zones were discovered for pfoa including a stable and nonvolatile zone 90 c a phase transfer and thermal decomposition zone 90 400 c and a fast decomposition zone 400 c the thermal decomposition began with the homolysis of a c c bond next to the carboxyl group of pfcas which formed unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals dual decomposition pathways seem to exist the addition of a highly porous adsorbent such as gac or a copolymer resin compressed the intermediate sublimation zone of pfcas changed their thermal decomposition pathways and increased the decomposition rate constant by up to 150 fold at 250 c the results indicate that the observed thermal decomposition acceleration was linked to the adsorption of gas phase pfca molecules on gac the presence of non activated charcoals biochars with a low affinity for pfoa did not accelerate its thermal decomposition suggesting that the π electron rich polyaromatic surface of charcoal gac played an insignificant role compared to the adsorbent s porosity overall the results indicate that 1 substantial decomposition of pfcas and genx during conventional thermal gac sludge waste treatment is very likely and 2 the presence or addition of gac or other highly porous materials can accelerate thermal pfas decomposition and alter decomposition pathways keywords gac regeneration thermal degradation long chain pfas short chain pfas hfpo da high

nonfluorinated counterparts perfluoroalkyl substances are chemically and biologically recalcitrant schröder and meesters 2005 sinclair and kannan 2006 xiao et al 2012 whereas polyfluoroalkyl substances including cationic or zwitterionic pfas are subject to degradation houtz et al 2016 jin et al 2020 lee et al 2010 nabb et al 2007 xiao et al 2018 once released to the natural environment

zwitterionic polyfluoroalkyl compounds during water disinfection by chlorine or ozone xiao et al 2018 the u s epa recently set a drinking water advisory on the combined level of pfoa and pfos at 0 070

25 900 c xiao et al 2020 the authors also developed a method for pfas extraction from gac xiao et al 2020 the term thermal stable has been frequently used to describe pfas in the literature however xiao et al observed 94 95 99 99 decomposition of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas on gac after a 30 min thermal treatment at low temperatures 200 300 c xiao et al 2020 the authors also found that the degradation of pfas in gac varied insignificantly between different atmospheric environments n2 co2 o2 xiao et al 2020 this discovery raises the question on the nature of pfas thermal decomposition can perfluoroalkyl substances be thermally degraded at 200 c without the presence of gac if so how fast is this process does gac facilitate the thermal degradation of these compounds if yes what is the relative importance of the polyaromatic surface and the porosity of gac answering these questions has important implications for understanding the fate of pfas in thermal water wastewater sludge waste treatment processes two important structural features of porous pyrogenic carbonaceous materials pcms including gac are the porosity and polyaromatic units kah et al 2017 an analogy can be drawn between polyaromatic units of porous pcms and the hexagonal sp 2 carbon graphene sheets that make up the surface of graphite graphene materials and carbon nanotubes the polyaromatic units jumble disorderedly to create nanopore networks during the activation step of gac production oxidative gases enter these networks remove obstructions such as tarry materials and open more pore networks the pcm family also includes natural charcoals generated during the incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass glover et al 2018 lehmann and joseph 2009 schmidt and noack 2000 skjemstad et al 2002 unlike gac charcoal particles have underdeveloped pore structures and show porosity mainly in the ultramicropore region 3 5 7 å xiao and pignatello 2016 natural charcoals are widespread in soils as a result of historical wildfires iii 2020 land clearing and crop residual burning lehmann and joseph 2009 schmidt and noack 2000 skjemstad et al 2002 contributing to 30 50 of soil organic carbon in certain areas such as midwest prairie soils glaser et al 2001 mao et al 2012 natural charcoals are similar in many respects to an engineered pcm form commonly known as biochar that has been modified such as to enhance its performance as an adsorbent in water and wastewater treatment the polyaromatic surface of both gac and biochar has been suggested to act as an electron shuttle accelerating the redox conversion of organic compounds kappler et al 2014 millerick et al 2013 tang et al 2011 another question arises whether charcoals biochars can alter the thermal degradation of pfas which has critical implications not only for fate transport studies of pfas under natural thermal conditions e g wildfires but for designing effective carbonaceous adsorbents for pfas this study was conducted to address the above questions and to better understand the thermal decomposition kinetics products and pathways of pfas focusing on the effect of gac and charcoals biochars 2 materials and methods 2 1 pfas chemicals the test chemical set for thermal treatments included pfos and five pfcas perfluorobutyric acid pfba pfoa

strynar et al 2015 xiao 2017 to confirm decomposition products reference standards of perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea and pfhpa were also prepared 2 2 thermal treatments t 1 the thermal decomposition of the studied pfas was performed in a closed borosilicate glass container xiao et al 2020 see the supplementary document in three conditions t 1 t 2 t 3 as shown in fig 1 before the thermal treatment in t 1 thermolysis a known quantity 1 2 10 5 mol or 0 005 g pfoa of pfas chemical powders or solution in the case of pfba and hfpo da was added into a pre cleaned container and air dried at 25 c the measurement of the weight or volume of pfas chemicals became less accurate below 1 2 10 5 mol of pfas the container with pfas was then capped with a ground glass stopper next we set a muffle furnace

vial to increase the available sa of the borosilicate glass container 0 025 m2 by 50 2 4 thermal treatments t 3 to prepare the thermal treatment in t 3 a pfas chemical was pre adsorbed to a porous adsorbent in water we could not conduct gas phase adsorption experiments because the thermal decomposition of pfca vapor is inevitable with increasing temperature to or above 150 c the test solution was prepared with distilled water containing 1 0 10 3 mol l nahco3 as a buffer and 1 0 10 3 mol l nacl the adsorption experiment was performed in 50 ml thermo scientific nunc sterile polypropylene vials rotated end over end at 10 rpm for four days at 22 c an apparent adsorption equilibrium was reached within four days after adsorption pfas laden adsorbent particles were split into two portions the first portion was freeze dried weighed and extracted using methanol v extr ml amended with 100 mmol l ammonium acetate nh4ac xiao et al 2020 to determine the mass before thermal treatment m pfas i the one point water adsorbent distribution coefficient is defined as the ratio of the adsorbed concentration c s to the dissolved concentration at equilibrium c w k d w s c s c w the second portion of the pfas laden adsorbent particles was placed in a closed container and heated in an air environment within a muffle furnace neytech vulcan 3 550 usa at a predetermined temperature after heat treatment and cooldown the sample was processed in the same way as described above for the t 1 experiment 2 5 other thermal treatments we also performed thermal decomposition in the atmosphere of n2 in this experiment the sample to be heated was first placed into a container and purged with n2 for 15 min to remove air the container was then capped with a ground glass stopper and heated in the muffle furnace at a pre determined temperature in addition to isothermal treatment we also examined the decomposition of pfas in a dynamic thermal environment briefly a known quantity of pfoa pfos chemical powders was placed in a closed container and heated dynamically in the muffle furnace at a 10 c min heating rate this heating rate was used previously in the thermogravimetric analysis tga xiao et al 2020 after heat treatment and cooldown the samples were treated in the same manner as the t 1 experiment finally the thermal decomposition of pfoa xiao et al 2020 and pfos at low and moderate temperatures 500 c was investigated by means of a thermal desorption pyrolysis system cds analytical connected to a gas chromatograph with an ms detector td pyr gc ms agilent gc 7890 and 5975c ms santa clara ca see the supplementary data for more details 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermal decomposition of pfas in three conditions we found that the thermal decomposition of pfas mostly followed first order kinetics at temperatures of 150 250 c in which the residual pfas mass m pfas t decreased in an exponential manner over heating time fig 1 at a higher temperature 300 c the decomposition of these chemicals can also be described by second order kinetics in which a plot of 1 m pfas t versus heating time is approximately linear for comparison purposes we used the first order decomposition rate constant k 1st min 1 in the following discussion the value of k 1st was below 0 005 min 1 for pfcas at 150 250 c in t 1 fig 2 pfeca hfpo da appears to be more easily degraded than the pfca with the same number of perfluorinated carbons i e pfba figs 1 and 2 this is consistent with our previous observation xiao et al 2020 that the perfluorinated chain becomes less thermally stable with the inclusion of a foreign group i e the ether group in hfpo da 3 2 effect of gac as illustrated in fig 2 gac accelerated the thermal decomposition of hfpo da at temperatures as low as 150 c in t 2 and t 3 conditions the gac induced acceleration was evident for pfcas at 200 c and up to a 60 fold increase in k 1st was observed t 2 and t 3 fig 2 this acceleration became even more significant at 250 c which led to a 150 fold increase in k 1st for pfunda fig 2 as displayed in fig 2 the acceleration effect was less pronounced for the short chain pfas pfba because the adsorption of pfba on gac was much weaker than that of its long chain homologues see fig s15 for adsorption isotherms of pfba hfpo da and pfoa on gac in the supplementary document the effect of gac became less marked at higher temperatures of 300 c and 400 c at which the significant thermolysis t 1 of pfcas was seen figs 1 and 2 a thermal treatment at 300 c in t 2 led to near complete decomposition 99 99 of pfoa within 60 min no attempt was made to maximize the thermal decomposition of pfcas a similar effect of gac was observed when the samples were heated anaerobically fig s16 of the supplementary data the k 1st of pfoa obtained in air was not significantly different from that obtained in n2 fig s16 because pfcea and pfca molecules were not pre adsorbed on gac in t 2 treatments we hypothesize that the accelerated decomposition was caused by the adsorption of gas phase pfcea pfca on gac that is much more thermally conductive 0 4 1 36 w m k than air 0 032 w m k at 100 c jin et al 2013 khaliji oskouei and tamainot telto 2019 the heat transfer is more efficient on gac than in air on the other hand the thermal conductivity of air increases with temperature at 400 c the effect of gac amendment on the thermal decomposition rate of pfas appears to be much less important 3 3 effect of other pcms and porous resin to test this hypothesis we conducted t 2 experiments with various pcms and one non carbonaceous material xad 2 resin the results are plotted as a function of the k d w s of pfoa fig 3 charcoals have a higher thermal conductivity 0 08 0 18 w m k behazin et al 2016 than air however raw charcoals are primarily microporous 20 å xiao and pignatello 2016 steric hindrance can result from narrow pore throats internal obstructions or pore blockage by occluded non covalently bound matter such as pyrolysis tars xiao and pignatello 2015a zhu et al 2005 the length of pfoa molecules is approximately 10 å xiao et al 2011 the steric bulk of pfoa molecules may limit their access to the interior micropore sa of raw charcoal that is available to n2 molecules therefore a low adsorption of pfoa on raw charcoals was observed fig 3 and the thermal decomposition of pfoa was not accelerated with the addition of a raw charcoal sample m350 m600 p350 or p700 the thermal air oxidation of raw charcoals caused pore wall etching and or unclogging of pores bearing tarry deposits generated during the carbonization step xiao et al 2017 xiao and pignatello 2016 this in turn widened pores of charcoal and created new sa which helped relieve steric hindrance for adsorption of pfoa molecules fig 3 as illustrated in fig 3 the thermal decomposition of pfoa increased significantly with the addition of a thermally air oxidized charcoal commercial porous materials gac or activated charcoal and xad 2 resin adsorbed pfoa strongly fig 3 reducing the thermal decomposition half life of pfoa from 400 min to less than 25 min at 200 c fig 3 the n2 b e t sa of the xad 2 resin 330 370 m2 g is lower than that of the thermally air oxidized m600 however the xad 2 resin is characterized by a broad pore size distribution and a mean pore size of 90 å mesopores 20 500 å have shown to be important for molecules to access deeper and smaller pores of adsorbents xiao and pignatello 2015a finally the borosilicate glass appeared to have no significant effect on the thermal decomposition of pfoa fig 3 3 4 thermal decomposition pathways pfcas yielded several transient intermediates at temperatures as low as 150 c figs 4 and s2 for a parent pfca with n perfluorinated carbons the highest yielding intermediate product is usually the shorter chained pfca with n 1 perfluorinated carbons figs 4 and s2 for example pfda yielded shorter chain pfcas in the following order pfna pfoa pfhpa pfpea pfba similarly the highest yielding byproduct of pfoa was pfhpa whereas pfba was a trace intermediate product this formation pattern seems to agree with the stepwise defluorination mechanism pathway ii in fig 5 that has been developed for photocatalysis wang et al 2008 reduction by hydrated electrons bentel et al 2019 and plasma singh et al 2019 treatments of pfas compounds however a closer look at the results reveals that it is not the predominant mechanism of the thermolysis of pfas first the yield of intermediate pfcas is low 5 mol during the t 1 treatment fig 4 second a clear stepwise pattern was not observed because all the short chain intermediates appeared nearly simultaneously figs 4 and s2 we propose a different thermal decomposition mechanism pathway i in fig 5 we believe thermal decomposition of pfas involves multistep radical chain reactions including initiation chain propagation recombination and termination xiao et al 2021 because of the strong c f bond we believe that the thermal decomposition of pfoa was initiated with the homolytic cleavage of the relatively weak c c bond located next to the carboxyl group of pfoa or the c s bond next to the sulfonate group of pfos the c c or c s bond splits forming a nonfluorinated moiety and a perfluoroalkyl biradical such as c7f14 m z 350 0 from pfoa or c8f16 m z 399 9 from pfos figs 6 and s4 the perfluoroalkyl radical further undergoes a series of defluorination or radical chain propagation reactions generating shorter chained perfluoroalkyl radicals fig 5 these perfluoroalkyl radicals may recombine with carboxyl group radical successively yielding pfca intermediates eventually these chain propagation reactions are terminated by producing the dead or very short fluorinated units in pathway i transient pfca intermediates are the minor product a number of intermediate perfluoroalkyl radicals species were identified fig s17 including cf3 m z 69 0 c3f3 m z 93 0 c2f4 m z 100 0 c2f5 m z 119 0 c3f5 m z 131 0 c3f7 m z 169 0 c4f7 m z 181 0 c5f9 m z 231 0 c6f11 m z 281 0 c7f13 m z 331 0 and c7f14 m z 350 0 many of these perfluoroalkyl radicals have also been observed in previous studies on the thermal treatment of pfos wang et al 2013 and perfluorocarbons kagramanov et al 1990 note that these species were detected by td pyr gc ms in an inert atmosphere helium at present our td pyr gc ms system is not able to operate in an air atmosphere however the general decomposition mechanism initiation chain propagation termination illustrated in fig 5 may also apply to the thermal treatment of pfas under active atmospheres it is evident that the presence of gac altered the decomposition pathway of pfcas significantly increasing yields of shorter chained pfca intermediates at 150 c figs 4 and s3 at 200 c the yield of pfna from pfda was maximized after a 30 min treatment in t 2 and then disappeared on the same time scale as the parent compound i e pfda figs 4 and s3 at a higher temperature 300 c the yield of pfna from pfda dropped to 10 mol after 5 min figs 4 and s3 and was negligibly low with a longer heating time as pfna quickly decomposed fig 1 previously no measurable shorter chained pfcas were detected after a 30 min thermal treatment of pfoa on gac at 400 c xiao et al 2020 3 5 effect of gac on the yield of f from pfoa the yield of f from pfoa during low temperature t 1 thermolysis 400 c remained less than 2 mol fig 6 the addition of gac t 2 significantly enhanced the yield of f fig 6a we observed a critical mass ratio of pfoa to gac 620 μmol pfoa ggac above which the effect of gac is insignificant in t 2 as the gac may become saturated with gas phase pfoa molecules fig 6b this ratio reflects a dynamic balance between the adsorption and thermal decomposition of gas state pfoa on the surface of gac it is more than one order of magnitude greater than the saturated adsorption amount 40 μmol pfoa ggac or the maximum adsorption capacity of the gac for pfoa in the liquid phase fig s15 3 6 three temperature zones according to dynamic decomposition results fig 7 three temperature zones can be recognized pfoa is stable and essentially nonvolatile at temperatures below 90 c zone a a rise in temperature above 90 c zone b triggers the phase transfer e g melting boiling sublimation of pfoa molecules xiao et al 2021 because of the rising vapor pressure kaiser et al 2005 pfoa molecules started to degrade in zone b when the temperature increased to 400 c or above zone c pfoa molecules were quickly degraded figs 2d and 7 the addition of gac compressed zone b and facilitated the thermal decomposition of pfoa pfos on the other hand is highly nonvolatile until 400 c xiao et al 2020 the thermal decomposition of pfos was not significantly affected with the presence of gac fig s18 4 conclusions the fate of pfas in thermal processes is poorly understood pfcas used as surface active agents in non stick cookware and fire fighting foams are generally assumed to be thermally stable at low temperatures 300 c contradictory to this prevailing view this study shows that the thermolysis of pfcas occurs at low temperatures of 150 200 c figs 2 and 4 albeit slowly we further demonstrated that the low temperature 150 300 c thermal decomposition of pfcas was accelerated by highly porous adsorbents the effect of gac is much less significant at 400 c at which the thermolysis of pfoa was markedly faster the results also indicate that 1 the n2 b e t sa of adsorbents is a poor predictor of the adsorption of pfoa molecules and 2 the polyaromatic units of pcms appear to be unimportant supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found online including uplc qtof ms ms methods td pyr gc ms

16944,methanogenic bioelectrochemical systems bess can convert carbon dioxide co2 to methane ch4 and may be used for anaerobic digester biogas upgrading however the effect of hydrogen sulfide h2s a common biogas component on bes performance is unknown thus the objective of this study was to assess the effect of h2s addition to the cathode headspace on bes performance at a range of initial gas phase h2s concentrations 0 6 v v as well as its effect on the anode and cathode microbial communities as the initial cathode headspace h2s increased from 0 to 2 v v biocathodic ch4 production increased by two fold to 3 56 0 36 mmol l d due to dissolved h2s transport from the cathode to the anode where h2s was oxidized elemental sulfur and sulfate were h2s oxidation products detected in the anode above 3 initial cathode headspace h2s biocathodic ch4 production declined due to inhibition a phylotype most closely related to methanobrevibacter arboriphilus dominated the cathode archaeal communities in the sulfide amended bes a phylotype similar to the exoelectrogen ochrobactrum anthropi was enriched in both the anode and cathode whereas phylotypes related to sulfate reducing and sulfur oxidizing bacteria were detected in the bioanode thus sulfide transport and oxidation in the anode play an important role in methanogenic bess treating sulfide bearing biogas keywords bioanode biocathode carbon dioxide methane methanobrevibacter sulfur oxidation 1 introduction anaerobic digestion produces a biogas that contains dioxide co2 methane ch4 and trace gasses including hydrogen sulfide h2s although present in small quantities h2s is an important component because it is a toxic highly corrosive gas that is converted to environmentally hazardous sulfur dioxide upon biogas combustion singhal et al 2017 the concentration of h2s in biogas depends on the sulfur content of the anaerobic digester feedstock with the production of about 0 6 to 1 9 h2s v v in biogas from the anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge peu et al 2012 moreover anaerobic digestion of alternative feedstocks e g food waste agricultural residue algae seaweed etc is gaining interest because of the potential for renewable energy production and recovery via combined heat and power ge et al 2016 however these alternative feedstocks often have a higher sulfur content than typical municipal sludge and thus the biogas h2s concentration may be much higher i e up to 17 h2s peu et al 2012 because of its corrosivity and undesirable combustion products h2s must be removed from biogas prior to its use downstream common methods of biogas h2s removal include chemical absorption bio oxidation to elemental sulfur s0 and precipitation of metal sulfur complexes in aqueous solutions dry sorbents such as iron oxide sponges are also used for small scale sulfide removal but require non regenerable and relatively short lived adsorbents abatzoglou and boivin 2009 following biogas desulfurization co2 may be removed to increase the biogas energy i e ch4 content in a process termed biogas upgrading anaerobic digester biogas typically contains 60 70 ch4 and 30 40 co2 which often limits energy recovery by combined heat and power chp units petersson and wellinger 2009 biogas upgrading to high quality biomethane 95 ch4 v v would allow biogas to be used in a far wider range of applications in addition to chp e g as transportation fuel or to be injected into natural gas pipelines to offset fossil fuel use unlike physical chemical methods of biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical systems bess are capable of upgrading biogas without requiring expensive consumables or high energy consumption geppert et al 2016 with a low applied cathode potential 1 v vs she easily obtained from renewable energy sources e g wind and solar energy bes biocathodes can convert co2 to ch4 while organic waste is oxidized at the bioanode however h2s which is present in most biogas is known to inhibit methanogenesis chen et al 2008 while the exact mechanism s of sulfide inhibition in anaerobic digestion and methanogenesis is are not clear studies suggest that the un ionized form of dissolved h2s may cross the membrane of microbial cells inducing toxicity thus a higher ph which shifts sulfide species equilibrium towards hs and s2 can mitigate and minimize sulfide inhibition chen et al 2008 hilton and oleszkiewicz 1988 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 microbial fuel cells mfcs have been shown to oxidize dissolved sulfide to s0 and can be used to polish digester effluent by removing sulfide and acetate fatemi et al 2017 rabaey et al 2006 indeed sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob can convert h2s to s0 and donate electrons to an anode ter heijne et al 2018 however the effect of h2s on methanogenic biocathodes and bess has not yet been determined therefore the objective of this study was to i compare bes performance under a range of initial biocathode h2s concentrations and ii compare the anode and cathode microbial communities before h2s exposure and after long term h2s exposure 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioelectrochemical system setup and operation two abiotic tests were conducted to evaluate h2s transport in the reactor text s1 s2 and two identical bess were developed bes1 and bes2 to evaluate the biological response to h2s in the cathode table s1 each bes was a dual chamber h type with two 350 ml 250 ml liquid volume modified square glass bottles separated by a proton exchange membrane pem nafion 117 6 16 cm2 dupont wilmington de as previously described dykstra and pavlostathis 2017a b both the anode and cathode electrodes consisted of carbon felt strips approximately 86 cm2 15 cm3 connected to stainless steel ss electron collectors a gamry 1000 interface potentiostat warminster pa was used to apply a fixed potential of 0 80 v vs she at the cathode using an adjacent ag agcl reference electrode the anode potential was allowed to fluctuate each bes compartment was filled with 250 ml phosphate

pavlostathis 2017b each chamber was then sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and initially flushed with nitrogen n2 anode or co2 cathode after each 7 d batch cycle the anolyte and catholyte was replaced and the anode and cathode were flushed with n2 and co2 respectively the bioanodes and biocathodes were inoculated with biofilm carrying carbon felt pieces removed from the bioanode or biocathode of a stock h2s free bes which was developed as previously described dykstra and pavlostathis 2017a b the anolyte and catholyte were completely replaced with fresh solutions each week sodium acetate served as the carbon and electron donor in the bioanode at an initial concentration of 1 5 g cod l the biocathode headspace was flushed with co2 and then pressurized to an absolute pressure of 1 65 atm this pressure was selected because co2 is highly soluble and upon equilibrium with the liquid phase the pressure in the cathode headspace was close to atmospheric pressure 1 atm the two bess were batch fed and maintained at 22 c under continuous magnetic mixing of both anolyte and catholyte after stable operation was achieved for 6 consecutive weeks h2s gas fisher scientific waltham ma was added to the bes2 cathode headspace at various initial concentrations 1 6 v v using a locking gas tight syringe current was continuously recorded with a gamry 1000 interface potentiostat warminster pa voltage current anolyte and catholyte ph and acetate concentrations and anode and cathode headspace pressure and gas composition were measured periodically throughout each batch cycle the h style configuration resulted in a relatively small membrane surface area compared to the surface area available at the porous anode electrode thus current density was calculated by normalizing current to the pem surface area anolyte sulfate concentrations were measured at the end of a feeding cycle elemental sulfur s0 deposition to the anode carbon felt was measured following 11 months of operation with h2s amendments to the bes2 cathode headspace s0 in the anode carbon felt was measured using a modified colorimetric method bartlett and skoog 1954 as explained below in abiotic systems

sulfate concentrations were measured using a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatography unit dionex corporation sunnyvale ca equipped with a suppressed conductivity detector a dionex ionpac ag14a 4 50 mm precolumn and a dionex ionpac as14a 4 250 mm analytical column sulfide transport from the anode to the cathode was demonstrated by electrochemically measuring dissolved sulfide in an abiotic system using a cathode platinum pt catalyst as described in text s2 figure s2 s0 in the bes2 anode carbon felt was measured by removing carbon felt pieces and tumbling overnight in toluene to extract s0 sulfides disulfides and mercaptans were precipitated out using mercuric chloride and s0 was measured colorimetrically bartlett and skoog 1954 using a hach 3900 spectrophotometer hach loveland co and a

protein was extracted from anode and cathode electrode carbon felt pieces by vortexing in 1 n naoh and glass beads for 20 min anode and cathode suspended biomass protein was extracted by centrifuging

scientific rockford il and a biotek synergy ht 96 well microplate spectrophotometer winooski vt 3 results and discussion 3 1 abiotic sulfide dissolution and transport the dissolution of sulfide from gas to liquid phase in the cathode and transport from cathode to anode was demonstrated by the electrochemical measurement of dissolved sulfide over time text s1 s2 the dissolution of sulfide from the cathode headspace into the catholyte occurred rapidly and approached equilibrium within 10 min fig 1 a furthermore as sulfide dissolved into the catholyte it was also transported across the pem into the anode compartment fig 1b figure s2 a similar membrane nafion 112 is reported to be permeable to dissolved sulfide sethuraman et al 2009 moreover the membrane used in the present study nafion 117 is permeable to several other dissolved gasses e g co2 h2 ch4 and n2 dykstra and pavlostathis 2017a following the addition of 3 h2s v v to the cathode headspace the anolyte sulfide concentration increased over time and reached a near equilibrium concentration of 0 12 mm within 60 min fig 1b figure s2 at equilibrium mass balance calculations estimate that the anolyte and catholyte will each contain 43 of the total sulfide added to the system and that the anode and cathode headspaces will each contain 7 of the total added sulfide figure s3 thus in theory equilibration following sulfide dissolution and transport from cathode to anode could remove 93 of the h2s initially added to the cathode headspace in the abiotic system 60 min after h2s addition to the cathode headspace the anolyte contained 48 of the total sulfur initially added to the cathode headspace as h2s which is in good agreement with the theoretical estimate of 43 because of the demonstrated transport of sulfide through the pem addition of h2s to the methanogenic bes cathode headspace is likely to affect both cathode and anode processes as well as their respective microbial communities 3 2 effect of low h2s on bes performance following the development of anode and cathode biofilm in the two identical bes1 and bes2 systems over 6 weeks both systems reached stable operation demonstrated by consistent bioanode acetate removal 69 72 biocathode ch4 production and current production over the course of three consecutive 7 d feeding cycles the performance of bes1 and bes2 was similar in the feeding cycle prior to the addition of h2s to the bes2 biocathode headspace table 1 in both systems the ph of the anolyte gradually declined over the course of a feeding cycle while the ph of the catholyte increased slightly table 1 before the first addition of h2s to the bes2 cathode headspace bes1 and bes2 were fed and monitored for 1 day although the current density was slightly lower in bes2 than in bes1 for the first day fig 2 a the biocathode ch4 production in each was similar fig 2b then on day 1 h2s was added to the bes2 cathode headspace at an initial gas phase concentration of 1 h2s v v the current density in bes2 almost immediately increased fig 2a and remained above that of bes1 for the remainder of the feeding cycle despite an initial lower current density prior to h2s addition thus the addition of h2s to the bes2 cathode headspace had a rapid but moderate effect on the system current which was sustained throughout the 7 d cycle while h2s may reduce the oxidation reduction potential orp of the medium the scavenging of trace oxygen o2 from the anode was not expected to be a significant cause for improvement in biocathode performance i e by removing inhibitory o2 prior work with an identical bes indicated that the o2 evolution reaction occurred at an anode potential of 1 4 v vs ag agcl dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 in the current study the anode potential did not exceed 1 25 v vs ag agcl indicating that the generation of o2 was not likely moreover methanobrevibacter sp has been shown to be capable of simultaneous ch4 production and o2 consumption with low o2 fluxes i e 10 of the ch4 production rate having no influence on methanogenesis tholen et al 2007 thus trace amounts of o2 would not be expected to affect the performance of the methanobrevibacter sp within the cathode biofilm moreover due to the mixed cultures in the anode and cathode in which many species are facultative and can use o2 it is expected that trace o2 would be consumed prior to penetrating the cathode biofilm on day 7 the bes1 and bes2 anolyte and catholyte were replaced sodium acetate was added to both anodes at an initial concentration of 1500 mg cod l the cathode headspaces flushed with co2 and pressurized to 1 65 atm then h2s was added to the bes2 cathode headspace at an initial gas phase concentration of 1 v v upon feeding the peak current density in bes2 was nearly twice as high as that in bes1 a pattern that was repeated at the next feeding on day 15 fig 2a the initial 7 d delay prior to the onset of substantial increase in both current and ch4 production in bes2 could be due in part to a lag phase in the growth of favorable bacterial species in the anode as discussed below it is also possible that some microbial interaction with h2s e g changes to metabolic pathways or enzyme production might have resulted in a lag in methanogenic activity following each feeding the current density declined over time due to the decline of the anode acetate concentration which resulted in a lower anode potential and thus a lower current density similar trends in current density have been noted in other studies of batch fed bess with a fixed cathode potential dykstra and pavlostathis 2017a b fu et al 2015 villano et al 2010 xu et al 2014 during the first 3 days of the second feeding cycle a constant ch4 production rate was observed indicating that co2 was not limiting bes1 and bes2 produced ch4 at a mean rate of 1 08 0 01 and 3 09 0 23 mmol l d respectively normalized to the catholyte volume 438 1 and 1254 94 mmol m2 d respectively normalized to the pem surface area to compare with previously reported values the bes1 and bes2 3 day ch4 production rate was converted to 26 4 0 1 and 75 6 4 6 l ch4 m3 d 25 c 1 atm respectively in our previous study co2 fed biocathodes inoculated with a mixed methanogenic culture and a culture enriched for hydrogenotrophic methanogens produced 8 1 0 6 and 36 7 1 9 l ch4 m3 d respectively dykstra and pavlostathis 2017b a co2 fed biocathode in another recent study produced 52 8 l ch4 m3 d when using a carbon felt cathode maintained at 20 c yang et al 2018 the difference in biocathode ch4 production rate among all studies is likely due to differences in pem surface area biomass concentration and microbial community composition regardless the addition of 1 h2s to the bes2 cathode headspace in the present study significantly increased biocathode ch4 production at the end of the second feeding cycle the total bes2 cathode ch4 production was 2 9 fold higher than in the sulfide free bes1 similarly during the third feeding cycle the total bes2 cathode ch4 production was 2 3 fold higher than in the bes1 in all cases the cathode headspace h2 concentration remained low 1 v v 3 3 biocathode ch4 production at various initial h2s concentrations to test the effect of various initial cathode headspace h2s concentrations a series of 3 day feeding cycles were conducted in which the initial h2s concentration was incrementally increased from 1 to 6 table 1 the cell potential ecell i e the potential difference between anode and cathode represents the driving force for electron transfer from anode to cathode because current is determined by the cell voltage e cell as described by e cell e cathode e anode the current may theoretically be affected by the anode voltage which in turn may be affected by anode conditions dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 the highest cathode to anode voltage gradients occurred during the 2 and 3 h2s cycles table 1 at moderate initial h2s concentrations the anode acetate utilization increased although anode exoelectrogens utilize acetate sulfate reducing bacteria srb may have also utilized acetate in the anode of the h2s amended bes as discussed in the following sections another effect of increasing initial cathode h2s concentration was a decrease in the cathode capture efficiency cce a measure of how efficiently cathodic microorganisms utilize electron equivalents to reduce co2 to ch4 eq 1 table 1 1 c c e t n c h 4 t n h 2 t n c i r c u i t t at time t c c e is the cathode capture efficiency fraction n c h 4 and n h 2 are the number of electron equivalents produced in the cathode as ch4 and h2 respectively and n c i r c u i t is the cumulative number of electron equivalents transferred through the circuit as measured by amperometry the decrease in cce with increasing h2s suggests that although h2s had an inhibitory effect on cathodic methanogenesis the effect may be outweighed by the positive effect of h2s on system current at relatively low initial h2s concentrations 3 h2s in contrast the addition of h2s increased the coulombic efficiency ce a measure of how efficiently anodic microorganisms utilize acetate electron equivalents to produce current eq 2 table 1 2 c e t n a c e t a t e t n c i r c u i t t at time t c e is the coulombic efficiency fraction n a c e t a t e is the number of electron equivalents released from oxidation of acetate in the anode it is important to note that the ce calculation in eq 2 assumes that i all of the acetate removed is used for exoelectrogenesis which may not be the case if sulfate is available for srb and ii acetate is the sole donor of electron equivalents to the anode without considering sulfide as an additional electron donor therefore while the ce appears to increase at higher cathode headspace initial h2s concentrations part or all of the effect may be due to sulfide donating electrons to the anode thus the actual anode biofilm ce could not be accurately determined at the end of the feeding cycles a significant fraction 11 24 of the initial sulfur added to the cathode headspace as h2s was recovered as so4 2 in the anolyte table 1 in contrast so4 2 was not detected in the bes1 anolyte or in the anolyte in an abiotic system in which a pt coated carbon cloth anode was used as a catalyst limited transport of negatively charged ions such as so4 2 is expected to occur across the selective pem thus it is unlikely that so4 2 produced in the anode would be able to re cross the membrane into the cathode compartment to interfere with methanogenesis furthermore following 11 months of operation with h2s amendments to the bes2 cathode headspace 3 v v the anode carbon felt contained traces of s0 2 4 11 7 µg s cm3 indicating h2s oxidation to s0 the deposition of s0 on the anode was spatially heterogeneous more s0 was deposited on carbon felt closest to the ss electron collector an abiotic i e uninoculated system was unable to oxidize sulfide to so4 2 indicating that the transformation of sulfide to so4 2 in the bioanode was biologically mediated indeed a previous study reported that a sulfide fed anode of a microbial fuel cell mfc generated current and produced sulfur oxidation products at three valence states ii 0 and vi with detected intermediates including s0 sx 2 s4o6 2 s2o3 2 and so4 2 sun et al 2009 the initial 3 day mean rate of ch4 production was assessed over multiple feeding cycles fig 3 the highest ch4 production rate normalized to the catholyte volume was achieved at 2 and 3 initial h2s 3 56 0 36 and 3 55 0 17 mmol l d respectively 1445 146 and 1443 71 mmol m2 d respectively which represented a two fold increase over the mean rate prior to h2s amendment 1 25 0 08 mmol l d 507 32 mmol m2 d table 1 in addition a t test of the data indicated a p value 0 00001 indicating the results were statistically significant in our previous study the ch4 production by a h2s free co2 fed methanogenic biocathode was 0 97 0 03 mmol l d 393 12 mmol m2 d which was increased to 2 16 0 08 mmol l d 877 31 mmol m2 d by the addition of 1 g l zero valent iron zvi as an additional source of cathode reducing power dykstra and pavlostathis 2017c the bell shaped profile of the ch4 production rate versus initial h2s concentration fig 3 indicates that h2s exerted at least two opposing effects on the bes performance enhanced vs inhibited ch4 production abiotic tests showed that h2s dissolves rapidly and is transported to the anode where it may contribute to current by donating electrons to the anode electrode a previous study reported that h2s oxidation to so4 2 s0 and other oxidized sulfur products was coupled to current production in a mfc sun et al 2009 thus in the present study it is likely that sulfide improved cathodic ch4 production by donating electrons to the anode increasing system current and thereby increasing the rate of biocathode co2 reduction at the anode acetate is oxidized to co2 by exoelectrogens but may also be utilized as an electron donor by srb if oxidized sulfur electron acceptors e g so4 2 are available in addition certain srb species are known to disproportionate s0 to hs and so4 2 lovley and phillips 1994 produced hs could have been oxidized back to so4 2 at the anode thus contributing to a dynamic sulfur system in the anode text s3 figure s4 as mentioned above srb may also utilize acetate and so4 2 producing h2s and co2 although srb may recycle so4 2 back to h2s or hs electron equivalents will be used for srb biomass production or so4 2 production in the case of s0 disproportionation instead of exoelectrogenesis exoelectrogens have a low biomass yield wilson and kim 2016 and thus the process of exoelectrogenesis is approximately 97 efficient in terms of electron transfer srb have a higher biomass yield and when using acetate and sulfate as an electron donor and acceptor respectively are approximately 89 efficient in terms of electron transfer liamleam and annachhatre 2007 similarly sulfide oxidation can be as low as 80 efficient in terms of electron transfer guerra santos et al 1986 schook and berk 1978 therefore when sulfide is present current may be increased but a larger portion of electron equivalents may be diverted to biomass production as further discussed in text s3 protein measurements of the suspended and biofilm biomass in each system after operation for 70 days 10 feeding cycles indicated that the addition of h2s to the bes2 cathode headspace significantly increased biomass in both the cathode and anode particularly as biofilm figure s4 a higher biofilm coverage was indeed visible on the bes2 cathode compared to bes1 figure s5 the anolyte and catholyte medium sulfur concentration 6 4 mg s l which was replenished prior to each feeding is within the recommended range of 1 to 25 mg s l for anaerobic systems chen et al 2008 thus the observed increase in bes2 biomass levels was not due to the relief of a sulfur deficiency but rather to the enrichment and promotion of bacteria involved in sulfur processing as discussed below at relatively low cathode headspace h2s concentrations 3 h2s v v the biocathode ch4 production increased because sulfide donated electrons to the anode resulting in higher current however as h2s concentrations increased above 3 h2s v v inhibition of methanogens resulted in decreased cce and ch4 production table 1 at 5 and 6 initial h2s the rate of ch4 production was 43 and 24 lower respectively than the mean rate prior to h2s amendment table 1 the total sulfide concentrations in the present study ranged from 4 1 to 24 3 mg s l table s2 methanogenesis may be inhibited by un ionized dissolved h2s but reported inhibitory concentrations vary widely based on various factors e g culture ph microbial community available substrates biomass concentration etc with values ranging from 50 to 220 mg s l chen et al 2014 2008 isa et al 1986a 1986b karhadkar et al 1987 koster et al 1986 maillacheruvu and parkin 1996 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 parkin et al 1983 yamaguchi et al 1999 one study reported a 50 inhibition of methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion when the produced gas contained 5 h2s v v karhadkar et al 1987 which is in agreement with the results of the present study at relatively low h2s concentrations biocathode biofilm can protect against sulfide inhibition by creating microenvironments with a lower dissolved sulfide concentration hall stoodley et al 2004 where methanogenic activity can occur furthermore the local ph near the biofilm cathode electrode surface is expected to be higher than the bulk ph of the well mixed catholyte because protons are used at the cathode surface to reduce either co2 to ch4 or h to h2 therefore the sulfide species near the cathode surface will shift towards hs and s2 away from h2s which is considered inhibitory to methanogens chen et al 2008 hilton and oleszkiewicz 1988 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 however at higher h2s concentrations the concentration of dissolved sulfide within the methanogenic biofilm may be high enough to inhibit methanogenesis lower biocathode methanogenic activity may result in a lower localized ph at the cathode surface due to a lower demand for h and shift the sulfide species near the cathode surface towards h2s which is inhibitory to methanogens chen et al 2008 hilton and oleszkiewicz 1988 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 3 4 phylogeny and microbial community diversity the bacterial and archaeal communities of the bes anodes and cathodes were analyzed after 6 months of operation in the final month bes2 was operated with 3 initial h2s v v cathode headspace gas at each feeding each otu above 1 relative abundance was queried against the genbank database and the closest genbank relative with a complete 16s rrna gene sequence and the highest quality match value was identified table s3 bacterial and archaeal otu counts for each sample are given in table s4 the bes1 anode biofilm and bes2 anode suspended biomass samples had very low archaeal counts relatively low archaeal counts were also obtained in bes1 anode suspended biomass and bes2 anode biofilm samples a higher number of archaeal otus were detected in the cathodes than in the anodes which was expected due to observed high cathodic methanogenic activity the presence of archaeal otus in the bes1 cathode suspended biomass suggests that mediated methanogenesis occurred in the bulk catholyte at a distance from the cathode electrode surface a single phylotype most closely related to methanobrevibacter arboriphilus dominated the archaeal community in the bes1 and bes2 cathode biofilm and suspended biomass table s5 enrichment of m arboriphilus as the dominant or sole archaeal phylotype on biocathodes has also been noted in other studies jiang et al 2014 siegert et al 2015 zeppilli et al 2015 the present study shows that the cathode suspended biomass archaeal community was similar in composition to that of the biofilm archaeal community the bes2 anode biofilm and suspended bacterial community had a substantially higher relative abundance of actinobacteria than the bes1 anode communities fig 4 a the bes2 anode biofilm also contained bacteroidetes firmicutes and other unclassified bacteria at a greater relative abundance than the bes1 anode biofilm indicating a higher diversity in the bes2 anode bacterial community indeed the shannon diversity indices table s4 show that the bes2 anode biofilm had a significantly greater bacterial diversity 2 76 shannon index than the bes1 anode biofilm 1 35 shannon index thus the presence of sulfide and or other sulfur species in the anode contributed to the increased diversity in the bes2 anode indeed the largest effect of h2s on community diversity was on the bes2 anode biofilm bacteria fig 4b table s4 all bacterial otus detected at 1 relative abundance were assessed for their relative abundance in the anode and cathode of bes1 and bes2 table s6 in the bes1 cathode a phylotype most closely related to proteiniphilum acetatigenes represented 43 of the biofilm bacterial otus and 11 of the suspended biomass bacterial otus in contrast this phylotype represented 17 and 24 of the bes2 biofilm and suspended biomass respectively two strains of proteiniphilum spp have been isolated from the granular sludge of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating brewery wastewater chen and dong 2005 proteiniphilum spp ferments amino acids chen and dong 2005 and anaerobically degrades polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs larsen et al 2009 proteiniphilum spp was also previously noted to be enriched under biocathode conditions dykstra and pavlostathis 2017b another phylotype which was most closely related to ochrobactrum anthropi was found across all cathode samples 3 of the bacterial otus were represented by this phylotype in the bes1 biofilm however this phylotype represented 43 of bacterial otus in the bes2 biofilm indicating substantial enrichment in the presence of h2s a slight enrichment also occurred in the suspended biomass the ochrobactrum sp phylotype represented 29 and 34 of the bacterial otus in the suspended biomass of bes1 and bes2 respectively ochrobactrum anthropi is a known exoelectrogen detected in mfcs jayashree et al 2014 kumru et al 2012 zuo et al 2008 although typically found under anodic conditions enrichment of exoelectrogens in biocathodes may facilitate the recycling of lysed cells and cellular products into electron equivalents that may be donated back to electrotrophic microorganisms such as methanogens some evidence suggests that exoelectrogens are beneficial to biocathodic ch4 production due to fermentation and recycling of cellular components dykstra and pavlostathis 2017b achromobacter sp was also detected in the anode biofilm anode suspended growth and cathode suspended growth in both bes1 and bes2 although achromobacter sp was not detected in the bes1 cathode biofilm it was detected in the bes2 cathode biofilm with a 10 relative abundance achromobacter sp is thought to be an exoelectrogen and has been reported to be present in anode biofilm in several studies subha et al 2019 you et al 2020 yousaf et al 2017 yu et al 2009 achromobacter sp has also been reported to grow on succinate with thiosulfate as an electron donor hutt et al 2021 and can be involved in the biodesulfurization of fossil fuels bordoloi et al 2014 thus the presence of sulfur in the bes2 cathode may have promoted the growth of achromobacter sp in the cathode biofilm a phylotype related to geobacter sulfurreducens one of the more well described exoelectrogens was only detected in the bes2 anode biofilm g sulfurreducens is a bacterium capable of utilizing acetate as an electron donor and an anode surface or elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor caccavo et al 1994 logan 2009 however g sulfurreducens is not able to use sulfate sulfite or thiosulfate as electron acceptors with acetate as an electron donor caccavo et al 1994 thus the growth of g sulfurreducens on the bes2 anode biofilm may have been stimulated by the transport of h2s from the cathode to anode and its subsequent oxidation to sulfate sun et al 2009 thus providing an alternate electron acceptor for g sulfurreducens besides the anode surface additionally g sulfurreducens may be involved in the anaerobic oxidation of ch4 at the anode which has been previously described in an anode biofilm dominated by methanobacterium 67 of archaea and geobacter 38 of bacteria gao et al 2017 indeed the anode biofilm in bes2 was enriched in both methanobacterium and geobacter methanobacterium represented 23 of total archaea in the bes2 anode biofilm but only represented 5 in the bes1 anode biofilm thus as ch4 is transported across the membrane from the cathode to the anode some ch4 oxidation may occur at the anode thereby contributing to current generation in these ways exoelectrogenic geobacter species may have contributed to the increased current observed in bes2 relative to the control most known srb belong to the δ proteobacteria class in the present study only the bes2 anode biofilm contained δ proteobacteria figure s5 in which srb related phylotypes represented 32 total and made up 1 of total bacteria in the biofilm figure s5 srb phylotypes i e syntrophus and geobacter were capable of sulfur reduction similarly srb such as desulfobulbus propionicus desulfovibrio sp and syntrophobacterales spp have been found in sulfide supplemented anodes and d propionicus is known to oxidize h2s to s0 followed by sulfur disproportionation to so4 2 and hs fuseler and cypionka 1995 lovley and phillips 1994 notably srb were not detected in the anode suspended biomass suggesting that anode sulfur cycling was not significant or occurred at the anode electrode surface and or within the biofilm microbes present in both bes1 and bes2 anode biofilms could have also altered their metabolism to take part in system sulfur cycling a phylotype closely related to pseudomonas aeruginosa represented 31 and 22 of the bacteria in the bes1 and bes2 anode biofilms respectively p aeruginosa is an exoelectrogen that can generate metabolites such as pyocyanin which can facilitate extracellular electron transfer between bacteria and electrodes qiao et al 2015 sun et al 2010 furthermore p aeruginosa can oxidize h2s and s0 to so4 2 schook and berk 1978 a previous study also found pseudomonas sp to be abundant in an anode where sulfur oxidation coupled to current production took place sun et al 2009 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that h2s transport to the anode and its subsequent oxidation can significantly enhance biocathode co2 reduction and ch4 production in a process that simultaneously upgrades biogas and removes h2s bes technology capable of removing and utilizing biogas h2s at concentrations up to 3 v v is promising for the future development of new biogas upgrading and cleaning systems as well as the utilization of alternative feedstocks for anaerobic digestion and energy recovery further study is needed to better understand the sulfur dynamics in a methanogenic bes in order to limit declines in cce optimize ch4 output and scale the system up declaration of competing interest the authors

16944,methanogenic bioelectrochemical systems bess can convert carbon dioxide co2 to methane ch4 and may be used for anaerobic digester biogas upgrading however the effect of hydrogen sulfide h2s a common biogas component on bes performance is unknown thus the objective of this study was to assess the effect of h2s addition to the cathode headspace on bes performance at a range of initial gas phase h2s concentrations 0 6 v v as well as its effect on the anode and cathode microbial communities as the initial cathode headspace h2s increased from 0 to 2 v v biocathodic ch4 production increased by two fold to 3 56 0 36 mmol l d due to dissolved h2s transport from the cathode to the anode where h2s was oxidized elemental sulfur and sulfate were h2s oxidation products detected in the anode above 3 initial cathode headspace h2s biocathodic ch4 production declined due to inhibition a phylotype most closely related to methanobrevibacter arboriphilus dominated the cathode archaeal communities in the sulfide amended bes a phylotype similar to the exoelectrogen ochrobactrum anthropi was enriched in both the anode and cathode whereas phylotypes related to sulfate reducing and sulfur oxidizing bacteria were detected in the bioanode thus sulfide transport and oxidation in the anode play an important role in methanogenic bess treating sulfide bearing biogas keywords bioanode biocathode carbon dioxide methane methanobrevibacter sulfur oxidation 1 introduction anaerobic digestion produces a biogas that contains dioxide co2 methane ch4 and trace gasses including hydrogen sulfide h2s although present in small quantities h2s is an important component because it is a toxic highly corrosive gas that is converted to environmentally hazardous sulfur dioxide upon biogas combustion singhal et al 2017 the concentration of h2s in biogas depends on the sulfur content of the anaerobic digester feedstock with the production of about 0 6 to 1 9 h2s v v in biogas from the anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge peu et al 2012 moreover anaerobic digestion of alternative feedstocks e g food waste agricultural residue algae seaweed etc is gaining interest because of the potential for renewable energy production and recovery via combined heat and power ge et al 2016 however these alternative feedstocks often have a higher sulfur content than typical municipal sludge and thus the biogas h2s concentration may be much higher i e up to 17 h2s peu et al 2012 because of its corrosivity and undesirable combustion products h2s must be removed from biogas prior to its use downstream common methods of biogas h2s removal include chemical absorption bio oxidation to elemental sulfur s0 and precipitation of metal sulfur complexes in aqueous solutions dry sorbents such as iron oxide sponges are also used for small scale sulfide removal but require non regenerable and relatively short lived adsorbents abatzoglou and boivin 2009 following biogas desulfurization co2 may be removed to increase the biogas energy i e ch4 content in a process termed biogas upgrading anaerobic digester biogas typically contains 60 70 ch4 and 30 40 co2 which often limits energy recovery by combined heat and power chp units petersson and wellinger 2009 biogas upgrading to high quality biomethane 95 ch4 v v would allow biogas to be used in a far wider range of applications in addition to chp e g as transportation fuel or to be injected into natural gas pipelines to offset fossil fuel use unlike physical chemical methods of biogas upgrading bioelectrochemical systems bess are capable of upgrading biogas without requiring expensive consumables or high energy consumption geppert et al 2016 with a low applied cathode potential 1 v vs she easily obtained from renewable energy sources e g wind and solar energy bes biocathodes can convert co2 to ch4 while organic waste is oxidized at the bioanode however h2s which is present in most biogas is known to inhibit methanogenesis chen et al 2008 while the exact mechanism s of sulfide inhibition in anaerobic digestion and methanogenesis is are not clear studies suggest that the un ionized form of dissolved h2s may cross the membrane of microbial cells inducing toxicity thus a higher ph which shifts sulfide species equilibrium towards hs and s2 can mitigate and minimize sulfide inhibition chen et al 2008 hilton and oleszkiewicz 1988 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 microbial fuel cells mfcs have been shown to oxidize dissolved sulfide to s0 and can be used to polish digester effluent by removing sulfide and acetate fatemi et al 2017 rabaey et al 2006 indeed sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob can convert h2s to s0 and donate electrons to an anode ter heijne et al 2018 however the effect of h2s on methanogenic biocathodes and bess has not yet been determined therefore the objective of this study was to i compare bes performance under a range of initial biocathode h2s concentrations and ii compare the anode and cathode microbial communities before h2s exposure and after long term h2s exposure 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioelectrochemical system setup and operation two abiotic tests were conducted to evaluate h2s transport in the reactor text s1 s2 and two identical bess were developed bes1 and bes2 to evaluate the biological response to h2s in the cathode table s1 each bes was a dual chamber h type with two 350 ml 250 ml liquid volume modified square glass bottles separated by a proton exchange membrane pem nafion 117 6 16 cm2 dupont wilmington de as previously described dykstra and pavlostathis 2017a b both the anode

apply a fixed potential of 0 80 v vs she at the cathode using an adjacent ag agcl reference electrode the anode potential was allowed to fluctuate each bes compartment was filled with 250 ml phosphate

pavlostathis 2017b each chamber was then sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and initially flushed with nitrogen n2 anode or co2 cathode after each 7 d batch cycle the anolyte and catholyte was replaced and the anode and cathode were flushed with n2 and co2 respectively the bioanodes and biocathodes were inoculated with biofilm carrying carbon felt pieces removed from the bioanode or biocathode of a stock h2s free bes which was developed as previously described dykstra and pavlostathis 2017a b the anolyte and catholyte were completely replaced with fresh solutions each week sodium acetate served as the carbon and electron donor in the bioanode at an initial concentration of 1 5 g cod l the biocathode headspace was flushed with co2 and then pressurized to an absolute pressure of 1 65 atm this pressure was selected because co2 is highly soluble and upon equilibrium with the liquid phase the pressure in the cathode headspace was close to atmospheric pressure 1 atm the two bess were batch fed and maintained at 22 c under continuous magnetic mixing of both anolyte and catholyte after stable operation was achieved for 6 consecutive weeks h2s gas fisher scientific waltham ma was added to the bes2 cathode headspace at various initial concentrations 1 6 v v using a locking gas tight syringe current was continuously recorded with a gamry 1000 interface potentiostat warminster pa voltage current anolyte and catholyte ph and acetate concentrations and anode and cathode headspace pressure and gas composition were measured periodically throughout each batch cycle the h style configuration resulted in a relatively small membrane surface area compared to the surface area available at the porous anode electrode thus current density was calculated by normalizing current to the pem surface area anolyte sulfate concentrations were measured at the end of a feeding cycle elemental sulfur s0 deposition to the anode carbon felt was measured following 11 months of operation with h2s amendments to the bes2 cathode headspace s0 in the anode carbon felt was measured using a modified colorimetric method bartlett and skoog 1954 as explained below in abiotic systems

precolumn and a dionex ionpac as14a 4 250 mm analytical column sulfide transport from the anode to the cathode was demonstrated by electrochemically measuring dissolved sulfide in an abiotic system using a cathode platinum pt catalyst as described in text s2 figure s2 s0 in the bes2 anode carbon felt was measured by removing carbon felt pieces and tumbling overnight in toluene to extract s0 sulfides disulfides and mercaptans were precipitated out using mercuric chloride and s0 was measured colorimetrically bartlett and skoog 1954 using a hach 3900 spectrophotometer hach loveland co and a

protein was extracted from anode and cathode electrode carbon felt pieces by vortexing in 1 n naoh and glass beads for 20 min anode and cathode suspended biomass protein was extracted by centrifuging

scientific rockford il and a biotek synergy ht 96 well microplate spectrophotometer winooski vt 3 results and discussion 3 1 abiotic sulfide dissolution and transport the dissolution of sulfide from gas to liquid phase in the cathode and transport from cathode to anode was demonstrated by the electrochemical measurement of dissolved sulfide over time text s1 s2 the dissolution of sulfide from the cathode headspace into the catholyte occurred rapidly and approached equilibrium within 10 min fig 1 a furthermore as sulfide dissolved into the catholyte it was also transported across the pem into the anode compartment fig 1b figure s2 a similar membrane nafion 112 is reported to be permeable to dissolved sulfide sethuraman et al 2009 moreover the membrane used in the present study nafion 117 is permeable to several other dissolved gasses e g co2 h2 ch4 and n2 dykstra and pavlostathis 2017a following the addition of 3 h2s v v to the cathode headspace the anolyte sulfide concentration increased over time and reached a near equilibrium concentration of 0 12 mm within 60 min fig 1b figure s2 at equilibrium mass balance calculations estimate that the anolyte and catholyte will each contain 43 of the total sulfide added to the system and that the anode and cathode headspaces will each contain 7 of the total added sulfide figure s3 thus in theory equilibration following sulfide dissolution and transport from cathode to anode could remove 93 of the h2s initially added to the cathode headspace in the abiotic system 60 min after h2s addition to the cathode headspace the anolyte contained 48 of the total sulfur initially added to the cathode headspace as h2s which is in good agreement with the theoretical estimate of 43 because of the demonstrated transport of sulfide through the pem addition of h2s to the methanogenic bes cathode headspace is likely to affect both cathode and anode processes as well as their respective microbial communities 3 2 effect of low h2s on bes performance following the development of anode and cathode biofilm in the two identical bes1 and bes2 systems over 6 weeks both systems reached stable operation demonstrated by consistent bioanode acetate removal 69 72 biocathode ch4 production and current production over the course of three consecutive 7 d feeding cycles the performance of bes1 and bes2 was similar in the feeding cycle prior to the addition of h2s to the bes2 biocathode headspace table 1 in both systems the ph of the anolyte gradually declined over the course of a feeding cycle while the ph of the catholyte increased slightly table 1 before the first addition of h2s to the bes2 cathode headspace bes1 and bes2 were fed and monitored for 1 day although the current density was slightly lower in bes2 than in bes1 for the first day fig 2 a the biocathode ch4 production in each was similar fig 2b then on day 1 h2s was added to the bes2 cathode headspace at an initial gas phase concentration of 1 h2s v v the current density in bes2 almost immediately increased fig 2a and remained above that of bes1 for the remainder of the feeding cycle despite an initial lower current density prior to h2s addition thus the addition of h2s to the bes2 cathode headspace had a rapid but moderate effect on the system current which was sustained throughout the 7 d cycle while h2s may reduce the oxidation reduction potential orp of the medium the scavenging of trace oxygen o2 from the anode was not expected to be a significant cause for improvement in biocathode performance i e by removing inhibitory o2 prior work with an identical bes indicated that the o2 evolution reaction occurred at an anode potential of 1 4 v vs ag agcl dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 in the current study the anode potential did not exceed 1 25 v vs ag agcl indicating that the generation of o2 was not likely moreover methanobrevibacter sp has been shown to be capable of simultaneous ch4 production and o2 consumption with low o2 fluxes i e 10 of the ch4 production rate having no influence on methanogenesis tholen et al 2007 thus trace amounts of o2 would not be expected to affect the performance of the methanobrevibacter sp within the cathode biofilm moreover due to the mixed cultures in the anode and cathode in which many species are facultative and can use o2 it is expected that trace o2 would be consumed prior to penetrating the cathode biofilm on day 7 the bes1 and bes2 anolyte and catholyte were replaced sodium acetate was added to both anodes at an initial concentration of 1500 mg cod l the cathode headspaces flushed with co2 and pressurized to 1 65 atm then h2s was added to the bes2 cathode headspace at an initial gas phase concentration of 1 v v upon feeding the peak current density in bes2 was nearly twice as high as that in bes1 a pattern that was repeated at the next feeding on day 15 fig 2a the initial 7 d delay prior to the onset of substantial increase in both current and ch4 production in bes2 could be due in part to a lag phase in the growth of favorable bacterial species in the anode as discussed below it is also possible that some microbial interaction with h2s e g changes to metabolic pathways or enzyme production might have resulted in a lag in methanogenic activity following each feeding the current density declined over time due to the decline of the anode acetate concentration which resulted in a lower anode potential and thus a lower current density similar trends in current density have been noted in other studies of batch fed bess with a fixed cathode potential dykstra and pavlostathis 2017a b fu et al 2015 villano et al 2010 xu et al 2014 during the first 3 days of the second feeding cycle a constant ch4 production rate was observed indicating that co2 was not limiting bes1 and bes2 produced ch4 at a mean rate of 1 08 0 01 and 3 09 0 23 mmol l d respectively normalized to the catholyte volume 438 1 and 1254 94 mmol m2 d respectively normalized to the pem surface area to compare with previously reported values the bes1 and bes2 3 day ch4 production rate was converted to 26 4 0 1 and 75 6 4 6 l ch4 m3 d 25 c 1 atm respectively in our previous study co2 fed biocathodes inoculated with a mixed methanogenic culture and a culture enriched for hydrogenotrophic methanogens produced 8 1 0 6 and 36 7 1 9 l ch4 m3 d respectively dykstra and pavlostathis 2017b a co2 fed biocathode in another recent study produced 52 8 l ch4 m3 d when using a carbon felt cathode maintained at 20 c yang et al 2018 the difference in biocathode ch4 production rate among all studies is likely due to differences in pem surface area biomass concentration and microbial community composition regardless the addition of 1 h2s to the bes2 cathode headspace in the present study significantly increased biocathode ch4 production at the end of the second feeding cycle the total bes2 cathode ch4 production was 2 9 fold higher than in the sulfide free bes1 similarly during the third feeding cycle the total bes2 cathode ch4 production was 2 3 fold higher than in the bes1 in all cases the cathode headspace h2 concentration remained low 1 v v 3 3 biocathode ch4 production at various initial h2s concentrations to test the effect of various initial cathode headspace h2s concentrations a series of 3 day feeding cycles were conducted in which the initial h2s concentration was incrementally increased from 1 to 6 table 1 the cell potential ecell i e the potential difference between anode and cathode represents the driving force for electron transfer from anode to cathode because current is determined by the cell voltage e cell as described by e cell e cathode e anode the current may theoretically be affected by the anode voltage which in turn may be affected by anode conditions dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 the highest cathode to anode voltage gradients occurred during the 2 and 3 h2s cycles table 1 at moderate initial h2s concentrations the anode acetate utilization increased although anode exoelectrogens utilize acetate sulfate reducing bacteria srb may have also utilized acetate in the anode of the h2s amended bes as discussed in the following sections another effect of increasing initial cathode h2s concentration was a decrease in the cathode capture efficiency cce a measure of how efficiently cathodic microorganisms utilize electron equivalents to reduce co2 to ch4 eq 1 table 1 1 c c e t n c h 4 t n h 2 t n c i r c u i t t at time t c c e is the cathode capture efficiency fraction n c h 4 and n h 2 are the number of electron equivalents produced in the cathode as ch4 and h2 respectively and n c i r c u i t is the cumulative number of electron equivalents transferred through the circuit as measured by amperometry the decrease in cce with increasing h2s suggests that although h2s had an inhibitory effect on cathodic methanogenesis the effect may be outweighed by the positive effect of h2s on system current at relatively low initial h2s concentrations 3 h2s in contrast the addition of h2s increased the coulombic efficiency ce a measure of how efficiently anodic microorganisms utilize acetate electron equivalents to produce current eq 2 table 1 2 c e t n a c e t a t e t n c i r c u i t t at time t c e is the coulombic efficiency fraction n a c e t a t e is the number of electron equivalents released from oxidation of acetate in the anode it is important to note that the ce calculation in eq 2 assumes that i all of the acetate removed is used for exoelectrogenesis which may not be the case if sulfate is available for srb and ii acetate is the sole donor of electron equivalents to the anode without considering sulfide as an additional electron donor therefore while the ce appears to increase at higher cathode headspace initial h2s concentrations part or all of the effect may be due to sulfide donating electrons to the anode thus the actual anode biofilm ce could not be accurately determined at the end of the feeding cycles a significant fraction 11 24 of the initial sulfur added to the cathode headspace as h2s was recovered as so4 2 in the anolyte table 1 in contrast so4 2 was not detected in the bes1 anolyte or in the anolyte in an abiotic system in which a pt coated carbon cloth anode was used as a catalyst limited transport of negatively charged ions such as so4 2 is expected to occur across the selective pem thus it is unlikely that so4 2 produced in the anode would be able to re cross the membrane into the cathode compartment to interfere with methanogenesis furthermore following 11 months of operation with h2s amendments to the bes2 cathode headspace 3 v v the anode carbon felt contained traces of s0 2 4 11 7 µg s cm3 indicating h2s oxidation to s0 the deposition of s0 on the anode was spatially heterogeneous more s0 was deposited on carbon felt closest to the ss electron collector an abiotic i e uninoculated system was unable to oxidize sulfide to so4 2 indicating that the transformation of sulfide to so4 2 in the bioanode was biologically mediated indeed a previous study reported that a sulfide fed anode of a microbial fuel cell mfc generated current and produced sulfur oxidation products at three valence states ii 0 and vi with detected intermediates including s0 sx 2 s4o6 2 s2o3 2 and so4 2 sun et al 2009 the initial 3 day mean rate of ch4 production was assessed over multiple feeding cycles fig 3 the highest ch4 production rate normalized to the catholyte volume was achieved at 2 and 3 initial h2s 3 56 0 36 and 3 55 0 17 mmol l d respectively 1445 146 and 1443 71 mmol m2 d respectively which represented a two fold increase over the mean rate prior to h2s amendment 1 25 0 08 mmol l d 507 32 mmol m2 d table 1 in addition a t test of the data indicated a p value 0 00001 indicating the results were statistically significant in our previous study the ch4 production by a h2s free co2 fed methanogenic biocathode was 0 97 0 03 mmol l d 393 12 mmol m2 d which was increased to 2 16 0 08 mmol l d 877 31 mmol m2 d by the addition of 1 g l zero valent iron zvi as an additional source of cathode reducing power dykstra and pavlostathis 2017c the bell shaped profile of the ch4 production rate versus initial h2s concentration fig 3 indicates that h2s exerted at least two opposing effects on the bes performance enhanced vs inhibited ch4 production abiotic tests showed that h2s dissolves rapidly and is transported to the anode where it may contribute to current by donating electrons to the anode electrode a previous study reported that h2s oxidation to so4 2 s0 and other oxidized sulfur products was coupled to current production in a mfc sun et al 2009 thus in the present study it is likely that sulfide improved cathodic ch4 production by donating electrons to the anode increasing system current and thereby increasing the rate of biocathode co2 reduction at the anode acetate is oxidized to co2 by exoelectrogens but may also be utilized as an electron donor by srb if oxidized sulfur electron acceptors e g so4 2 are available in addition certain srb species are known to disproportionate s0 to hs and so4 2 lovley and phillips 1994 produced hs could have been oxidized back to so4 2 at the anode thus contributing to a dynamic sulfur system in the anode text s3 figure s4 as mentioned above srb may also utilize acetate and so4 2 producing h2s and co2 although srb may recycle so4 2 back to h2s or hs electron equivalents will be used for srb biomass production or so4 2 production in the case of s0 disproportionation instead of exoelectrogenesis exoelectrogens have a low biomass yield wilson and kim 2016 and thus the process of exoelectrogenesis is approximately 97 efficient in terms of electron transfer srb have a higher biomass yield and when using acetate and sulfate as an electron donor and acceptor respectively are approximately 89 efficient in terms of electron transfer liamleam and annachhatre 2007 similarly sulfide oxidation can be as low as 80 efficient in terms of electron transfer guerra santos et al 1986 schook and berk 1978 therefore when sulfide is present current may be increased but a larger portion of electron equivalents may be diverted to biomass production as further discussed in text s3 protein measurements of the suspended and biofilm biomass in each system after operation for 70 days 10 feeding cycles indicated that the addition of h2s to the bes2 cathode headspace significantly increased biomass in both the cathode and anode particularly as biofilm figure s4 a higher biofilm coverage was indeed visible on the bes2 cathode compared to bes1 figure s5 the anolyte and catholyte medium sulfur concentration 6 4 mg s l which was replenished prior to each feeding is within the recommended range of 1 to 25 mg s l for anaerobic systems chen et al 2008 thus the observed increase in bes2 biomass levels was not due to the relief of a sulfur deficiency but rather to the enrichment and promotion of bacteria involved in sulfur processing as discussed below at relatively low cathode headspace h2s concentrations 3 h2s v v the biocathode ch4 production increased because sulfide donated electrons to the anode resulting in higher current however as h2s concentrations increased above 3 h2s v v inhibition of methanogens resulted in decreased cce and ch4 production table 1 at 5 and 6 initial h2s the rate of ch4 production was 43 and 24 lower respectively than the mean rate prior to h2s amendment table 1 the total sulfide concentrations in the present study ranged from 4 1 to 24 3 mg s l table s2 methanogenesis may be inhibited by un ionized dissolved h2s but reported inhibitory concentrations vary widely based on various factors e g culture ph microbial community available substrates biomass concentration etc with values ranging from 50 to 220 mg s l chen et al 2014 2008 isa et al 1986a 1986b karhadkar et al 1987 koster et al 1986 maillacheruvu and parkin 1996 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 parkin et al 1983 yamaguchi et al 1999 one study reported a 50 inhibition of methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion when the produced gas contained 5 h2s v v karhadkar et al 1987 which is in agreement with the results of the present study at relatively low h2s concentrations biocathode biofilm can protect against sulfide inhibition by creating microenvironments with a lower dissolved sulfide concentration hall stoodley et al 2004 where methanogenic activity can occur furthermore the local ph near the biofilm cathode electrode surface is expected to be higher than the bulk ph of the well mixed catholyte because protons are used at the cathode surface to reduce either co2 to ch4 or h to h2 therefore the sulfide species near the cathode surface will shift towards hs and s2 away from h2s which is considered inhibitory to methanogens chen et al 2008 hilton and oleszkiewicz 1988 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 however at higher h2s concentrations the concentration of dissolved sulfide within the methanogenic biofilm may be high enough to inhibit methanogenesis lower biocathode methanogenic activity may result in a lower localized ph at the cathode surface due to a lower demand for h and shift the sulfide species near the cathode surface towards h2s which is inhibitory to methanogens chen et al 2008 hilton and oleszkiewicz 1988 mccartney and oleszkiewicz 1991 3 4 phylogeny and microbial community diversity the bacterial and archaeal communities of the bes anodes and cathodes were analyzed after 6 months of operation in the final month bes2 was operated with 3 initial h2s v v cathode headspace gas at each feeding each otu above 1 relative abundance was queried against the genbank database and the closest genbank relative with a complete 16s rrna gene sequence and the highest quality match value was identified table s3 bacterial and archaeal otu counts for each sample are given in table s4 the bes1 anode biofilm and bes2 anode suspended biomass samples had very low archaeal counts relatively low archaeal counts were also obtained in bes1 anode suspended biomass and bes2 anode biofilm samples a higher number of archaeal otus were detected in the cathodes than in the anodes which was expected due to observed high cathodic methanogenic activity the presence of archaeal otus in the bes1 cathode suspended biomass suggests that mediated methanogenesis occurred in the bulk catholyte at a distance from the cathode electrode surface a single phylotype most closely related to methanobrevibacter arboriphilus dominated the archaeal community in the bes1 and bes2 cathode biofilm and suspended biomass table s5 enrichment of m arboriphilus as the dominant or sole archaeal phylotype on biocathodes has also been noted in other studies jiang et al 2014 siegert et al 2015 zeppilli et al 2015 the present study shows that the cathode suspended biomass archaeal community was similar in composition to that of the biofilm archaeal community the bes2 anode biofilm and suspended bacterial community had a substantially higher relative abundance of actinobacteria than the bes1 anode communities fig 4 a the bes2 anode biofilm also contained bacteroidetes firmicutes and other unclassified bacteria at a greater relative abundance than the bes1 anode biofilm indicating a higher diversity in the bes2 anode bacterial community indeed the shannon diversity indices table s4 show that the bes2 anode biofilm had a significantly greater bacterial diversity 2 76 shannon index than the bes1 anode biofilm 1 35 shannon index thus the presence of sulfide and or other sulfur species in the anode contributed to the increased diversity in the bes2 anode indeed the largest effect of h2s on community diversity was on the bes2 anode biofilm bacteria fig 4b table s4 all bacterial otus detected at 1 relative abundance were assessed for their relative abundance in the anode and cathode of bes1 and bes2 table s6 in the bes1 cathode a phylotype most closely related to proteiniphilum acetatigenes represented 43 of the biofilm bacterial otus and 11 of the suspended biomass bacterial otus in contrast this phylotype represented 17 and 24 of the bes2 biofilm and suspended biomass respectively two strains of proteiniphilum spp have been isolated from the granular sludge of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor treating brewery wastewater chen and dong 2005 proteiniphilum spp ferments amino acids chen and dong 2005 and anaerobically degrades polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs larsen et al 2009 proteiniphilum spp was also previously noted to be enriched under biocathode conditions dykstra and pavlostathis 2017b another phylotype which was most closely related to ochrobactrum anthropi was found across all cathode samples 3 of the bacterial otus were represented by this phylotype in the bes1 biofilm however this phylotype represented 43 of bacterial otus in the bes2 biofilm indicating substantial enrichment in the presence of h2s a slight enrichment also occurred in the suspended biomass the ochrobactrum sp phylotype represented 29 and 34 of the bacterial otus in the suspended biomass of bes1 and bes2 respectively ochrobactrum anthropi is a known exoelectrogen detected in mfcs jayashree et al 2014 kumru et al 2012 zuo et al 2008 although typically found under anodic conditions enrichment of exoelectrogens in biocathodes may facilitate the recycling of lysed cells and cellular products into electron equivalents that may be donated back to electrotrophic microorganisms such as methanogens some evidence suggests that exoelectrogens are beneficial to biocathodic ch4 production due to fermentation and recycling of cellular components dykstra and pavlostathis 2017b achromobacter sp was also detected in the anode biofilm anode suspended growth and cathode suspended growth in both bes1 and bes2 although achromobacter sp was not detected in the bes1 cathode biofilm it was detected in the bes2 cathode biofilm with a 10 relative abundance achromobacter sp is thought to be an exoelectrogen and has been reported to be present in anode biofilm in several studies subha et al 2019 you et al 2020 yousaf et al 2017 yu et al 2009 achromobacter sp has also been reported to grow on succinate with thiosulfate as an electron donor hutt et al 2021 and can be involved in the biodesulfurization of fossil fuels bordoloi et al 2014 thus the presence of sulfur in the bes2 cathode may have promoted the growth of achromobacter sp in the cathode biofilm a phylotype related to geobacter sulfurreducens one of the more well described exoelectrogens was only detected in the bes2 anode biofilm g sulfurreducens is a bacterium capable of utilizing acetate as an electron donor and an anode surface or elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor caccavo et al 1994 logan 2009 however g sulfurreducens is not able to use sulfate sulfite or thiosulfate as electron acceptors with acetate as an electron donor caccavo et al 1994 thus the growth of g sulfurreducens on the bes2 anode biofilm may have been stimulated by the transport of h2s from the cathode to anode and its subsequent oxidation to sulfate sun et al 2009 thus providing an alternate electron acceptor for g sulfurreducens besides the anode surface additionally g sulfurreducens may be involved in the anaerobic oxidation of ch4 at the anode which has been previously described in an anode biofilm dominated by methanobacterium 67 of archaea and geobacter 38 of bacteria gao et al 2017 indeed the anode biofilm in bes2 was enriched in both methanobacterium and geobacter methanobacterium represented 23 of total archaea in the bes2 anode biofilm but only represented 5 in the bes1 anode biofilm thus as ch4 is transported across the membrane from the cathode to the anode some ch4 oxidation may occur at the anode thereby contributing to current generation in these ways exoelectrogenic geobacter species may have contributed to the increased current observed in bes2 relative to the control most known srb belong to the δ proteobacteria class in the present study only the bes2 anode biofilm contained δ proteobacteria figure s5 in which srb related phylotypes represented 32 total and made up 1 of total bacteria in the biofilm figure s5 srb phylotypes i e syntrophus and geobacter were capable of sulfur reduction similarly srb such as desulfobulbus propionicus desulfovibrio sp and syntrophobacterales spp have been found in sulfide supplemented anodes and d propionicus is known to oxidize h2s to s0 followed by sulfur disproportionation to so4 2 and hs fuseler and cypionka 1995 lovley and phillips 1994 notably srb were not detected in the anode suspended biomass suggesting that anode sulfur cycling was not significant or occurred at the anode electrode surface and or within the biofilm microbes present in both bes1 and bes2 anode biofilms could have also altered their metabolism to take part in system sulfur cycling a phylotype closely related to pseudomonas aeruginosa represented 31 and 22 of the bacteria in the bes1 and bes2 anode biofilms respectively p aeruginosa is an exoelectrogen that can generate metabolites such as pyocyanin which can facilitate extracellular electron transfer between bacteria and electrodes qiao et al 2015 sun et al 2010 furthermore p aeruginosa can oxidize h2s and s0 to so4 2 schook and berk 1978 a previous study also found pseudomonas sp to be abundant in an anode where sulfur oxidation coupled to current production took place sun et al 2009 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that h2s transport to the anode and its subsequent oxidation can significantly enhance biocathode co2 reduction and ch4 production in a process that simultaneously upgrades biogas and removes h2s bes technology capable of removing and utilizing biogas h2s at concentrations up to 3 v v is promising for the future development of new biogas upgrading and cleaning systems as well as the utilization of alternative feedstocks for anaerobic digestion and energy recovery further study is needed to better understand the sulfur dynamics in a methanogenic bes in order to limit declines in cce optimize ch4 output and scale the system up declaration of competing interest the authors
