production and the fed batch cycle time t required to meet the discharge standards under varying influent concentrations of organics and nutrients field data from the algal system fed with primary effluent at feed to culture volume ratio vf vc of 400 300 were used to calibrate the model additional data from runs with vf vc 400 300 and with vf vc 500 200 were used to validate the model predicted

vf vc 400 300 somewhat lower quality of predictions noted in the runs with vf vc 500 200 is attributed to the disproportional substrate removals resulting from the mismatch of stoichiometric c n p ratio between the algal species and the feed sensitivity analysis indicated the kinetic coefficient for phosphate phosphorus reduction as the most sensitive parameter quality of the predictions in

nitrogen nh4 n and phosphate phosphorus po4 p in primary effluent to be removed in a single step 1 3 by eliminating the need for mechanical aeration this algal system conserves significant energy currently used for wastewater treatment and lowers the associated greenhouse gas ghg emissions 4 5 additionally by eliminating loss of organic carbon as carbon dioxide and nh4 n as gaseous n2 the a wwt system affords higher recovery of energy and nutrients embedded in the wastewater 4 6 as such the a wwt system has the potential to lower the carbon and ecological footprint of wastewater treatment and serve as a greener alternative to the current practice 1 2 performance of the a wwt system the a wwt system utilizes an extremophilic alga galdieria sulphuraria which has been demonstrated for the first time in our laboratory studies to be capable of growing mixotrophically in primary effluent 7 a pilot scale configuration of this a wwt system installed at the local wastewater treatment plant wwtp has been operational for over three years treating primary effluent of varying pollutant loads previous reports on fed batch operation of the a wwt system have documented its ability to reduce bod nh4 n and po4 p levels to discharge standards within 2 3 days 1 3 extreme culture conditions in the a wwt system ph 2 4 temperature 27 c 46 c dissolved oxygen 6 8 mg l have been shown to achieve superior inactivation of pathogenic bacteria and viruses antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs and antibiotic resistant genes args relative to the parallel activated sludge based system at the local wwtp 8 13 it has also been documented that downstream processes in the a wwt system can recover 54 kwh of gross energy as well as 2 5 kg of struvite and 1 7 kg of ammonium sulfate per 100 m3 of wastewater for use as crop fertilizers 4 6 physical chemical and microbiological water quality measures of the final effluent from the a wwt system after ph adjustment have been shown to meet the guidelines for all types of restricted non potable reuse applications 5 the above features of the a wwt system motivated the current study to develop a process model to enable scaling up of the system for larger scale applications we envisage that the a wwt system is most suited for small to medium size 10 mgd applications configured for fed batch operation with parallel treatment trains design and operation of such systems require prior knowledge of the fed batch cycle time required to meet all the discharge standards our previous modeling attempts towards this end have predicted the removal of organic carbon and nutrients cycle by cycle considering initial concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p in each cycle immediately after mixing of the feed with the culture at a fix feed culture blending ratio of 400 300 14 that study aimed to validate the removal kinetics of bod nh4 n and po4 p and to predict the cycle time the current model builds upon the previous one refining it to describe continuous operation of a series of fed batch cycles under random variations of the concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p in the primary effluent as well as varying feed culture blending ratios a new feature included in the current model is its ability to predict biomass growth the primary goal of the current effort was to predict the fed batch cycle time t to meet the discharge standards under varying influent concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p in the primary effluent pe a related goal was to predict biomass production end of each cycle under fed batch mode which has not been done previously field data were used to evaluate the quality of model predictions under two pe culture blending ratios of 400 300 and 500 200 vol vol 2 methodology 2 1 model development 2 1 1 modeling of effluent bod nh4 n and po4 p concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p in the feed were taken as the input variables for this model based on mass conservation and the assumption of complete mixing of feed and algal culture remaining in the a wwt system from the previous cycle initial concentrations in each fed batch cycle immediately after mixing are found from eq 1 1 c j 0 c j f v f c j v c v f v c c j f v f v c c j v f v c 1 where cj 0 is the initial concentration of pollutant j j bod nh4 n or po4 p cj f is the concentration of j in the feed wastewater cj is the residual concentration of j from the previous cycle vf is the volume of feed and vc is the volume of algal culture remaining in the reactor from the previous cycle following our previous studies 1 3 14 removals of bod nh4 n and po4 p were considered to be according to first order kinetics thus temporal variation of concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p in each fed batch cycle could be described by eq 2 2 c j t c j 0 e x p k j t c j f v f v c c j v f v c 1 e x p k j t where cj t denotes the concentration of j as a function of time t during a particular batch and kj is the first order rate constant for j j bod nh4 n or po4 p time required to reach the respective discharge standard tj was determined from eqs 2 and 3 3 t j 1 k j l n c j s t d c j 0 and the overall fed batch processing time t was determined from eq 4 4 t m a x t b o d t n h 4 n t p o 4 p where cj std denotes the discharge standard for j bod 30 mg l nh4 n 10 mg l po4 p 1 mg l first order rate constants reported in a previous study based on field data from the a wwt system kbod 0 311 d 1 knh4 n 0 505 d 1 and kpo4 p 0 663 d 1 were used in the current model to assess their adequacy in predicting process outcomes under different blending ratios 14 2 1 2 prediction of effluent biomass density based on the stoichiometric formula of algal biomass c83h166o34n14s2p1 and the c n p composition of the feed carbon is identified as the limiting factor for the majority of the treatment cycles 15 therefore algal biomass growth was assumed to be proportional to the bod reduction accordingly temporal biomass growth was estimated from eqs 5 and 6 5 y b i o 1 n i 0 n δ x δ b o d 6 x t x 0 y b i o δ b o d t where δx is the increment in the dry density of biomass in a particular cycle and δbod is the corresponding bod reduction in that cycle n is the number of fed batch cycles ybio is the biomass yield xt is the dry density of biomass in the a wwt system at any time t x0 is the initial dry density of biomass immediately after mixing and δ bodt is the reduction in the bod concentration at any time t dry density data collected from 10 fed batch cycles operated with vf vc 400 300 was used to estimate the biomass yield ybio under field conditions then additional data collected with vf vc 400 300 and vf vc 500 200 were used to validate the model and the presumption of linear proportionality of biomass growth to bod reduction eq 7 which was derived previously based on laboratory scale experiments was used to convert optical density measurements at 750 nm wavelength od750 into dry density of biomass

quality parameters and biomass density was assessed based on root mean square error rmse and theil s inequality coefficient tic given by eqs 8 and 9 respectively 16 18 lower rmse values rmse 0

processing time corresponding to the change of p from its base value and t p is the overall batch processing time corresponding to the base value of p 2 2 operation of the a wwt system and data collection an overview of the pilot scale configuration of the a wwt system is included in the supplementary information si section details of the operation of the system are well documented elsewhere 1 3 briefly fed batch operation of the system consisting of 2 700 l reactors was as follows each fed batch cycle was initiated by adding the feed volume of vf to the reactor containing algal cultures of volume vc remaining from the previous cycle to make up a total working volume of 700 l and depth of 20 cm once the reactor concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p reached the discharge standards a volume of 700 vc of the reactor contents was discharged and a new cycle was initiated with a fresh charge of the feed of volume vf following our early testing of the a wwt system in batch mode with vf vc of 400 300 1 the system was switched to fed batch mode with the same vf vc of 400 300 3 in the current study performance of the system under a higher blending ratio vf vc of 500 200 was tested and compared with that recorded at vf vc of 400 300 typical water quality characteristics of the primary effluent are detailed in the si section 2 3 water quality monitoring samples were collected daily from the a wwt system to analyze water quality nh4 n and po4 p were measured daily using a hach dr 6000 spectrophotometer following salicylate method 8155 and phosver3 method 8048 respectively bod was measured once in two days following standard method 5210 b optical density at 750 nm wavelength od750 was used as a surrogate parameter to evaluate algal biomass growth during the fed batch treatment od750 was measured with a hach dr 6000 spectrophotometer 1 cm cuvette 3 results discussions 3 1 prediction of bod nh4 n and po4 p data collected during fed batch operation of the a wwt system fed with primary effluent at vf vc 400 300 2 reactors 20 cycles each and at vf vc 500 200 2 reactors 13 cycles each were used to validate the model developed here since the a wwt system was able to attain the discharge standards for bod within 2 days of fed batch operation bod concentrations were measured only on the second day as shown in fig 1 predicted bod values correlated well with the measured values with r2 0 97 n 40 at vf vc of 400 300 the lower rmse value of 3 74 mg l 12 of the discharge standard and the tic of 0 09 0 3 for the predicted bod concentration on day 2 indicate reasonable validity of the model model simulations indicated that the a wwt system can attain discharge standards for bod 30 mg l within an average processing time of 0 76 0 43 days fig 2 a summarizes measured and predicted day to day concentrations of nh4 n for three days over the 40 cycles run with vf vc of 400 300 predicted daily concentrations of nh4 n showed reasonable correlation with the measured values with an overall r2 0 90 n 120 overall rmse value of 2 77 mg l was comparable with our previous study accounting cycle by cycle prediction of daily nh4 n concentrations 14 tic value of 0 19 0 3 for daily predicted nh4 n concentrations for the 40 cycles suggests reasonable validity of the model 17 average fed batch processing time required to reach discharge standards for nh4 n was 0 77 0 27 days fig 2b summarizes measured and predicted day to day concentrations of po4 p over the 40 cycles run with vf vc of 400 300 correlation between the predicted and measured values was strong with an overall r2 0 95 n 120 overall rmse and the tic values for daily predicted po4 p concentrations were 0 29 mg l and 0 14 0 3 respectively for the 40 cycles average fed batch processing time required to reach discharge standards for po4 was 1 37 0 46 days overall daily predictions of bod nh4 n and po4 p in the current model are better than those of our previous model for the a wwt system bod r2 0 70 n 30 nh4 n r2 0 82 n 90 po4 p r2 0 87 n 90 based on data obtained with vf vc 400 300 14 the current version of the model is a refined one in that it accounts for continuous operation of sequence of fed batch cycles whereas the previous one predicted the performance cycle by cycle 14 in addition inputs to the model in the previous version were the initial concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p immediately after mixing of the feed and the cultures the current model uses the concentrations in the feed i e pe as the inputs predictive ability of the model was further evaluated using the data collected with vf vc of 500 200 here the model was applied using the same first order kinetic coefficients derived from the runs with vf vc 400 300 fig 3 depicts the correlation between the predicted concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p and the corresponding values measured at the end of each fed batch cycle even though no adjustments were made to the kinetic coefficients predictions of bod and po4 p concentrations can be seen to be acceptable with tic values of 0 25 0 3 and 0 29 0 3 respectively but was poor in the case of nh4 n with tic value of 0 39 0 3 overall rmse values of daily predicted bod nh4 n and po4 p were 11 29 mg l 6 39 mg l and 1 4 mg l respectively as expected these runs with vf vc 500 200 necessitated longer fed batch processing times to attain discharge standards for bod 0 66 0 54 days nh4 n 0 70 0 37 days and po4 p 2 36 0 64 days substrate uptake removal and biomass productivity are reported to be influenced by characteristics of the cultivation medium e g carbon and nutrient loading temperature solar irradiance etc 19 22 imbalance in the stoichiometric c n p composition of algal biomass and that in the feed water can result in disproportionality in substrate removal 2 22 unlike in the fed batch operations with vf vc 400 300 the stoichiometric c n 5 1 and c p 32 1 ratios in galdieria sulphuraria matched poorly with those in the feed water with vf vc 500 200 c n 2 1 and c p 6 1 this mismatch of carbon and nutrients might have resulted in poor removal of n and p relative to c and thereby contributed to moderate prediction of po4 p and poor prediction of nh4 n for vf vc 500 200 in the current model which utilizes kinetic coefficients derived from runs with vf vc 400 300 in addition to differences in algal growth characteristics smaller sample size considered 26 vs 40 fed batch cycles might have contributed to slightly higher rmse values for fed batch operation with vf vc of 500 200 compared to those with 400 300 23 3 2 prediction of cycle time t for efficient operation of fed batch systems it is essential to know in advance the cycle time to meet the discharge standards under varying influent concentrations according to the model predictions in most of the cycles the time required to reach standards was highest for po4 p and lowest for bod irrespective of the variations in the feed composition this disparity can be explained by the different substrate uptake rates of the algal biomass rates at which carbon and nutrients are utilized by algal biomass depend on the stoichiometric carbon and nutrient requirements metabolic characteristics of the species and environmental conditions e g temperature ph medium etc 24 based on the stochiometric formula for galdieria sulphuraria biomass yield y with respect to c n and p are estimated as 2 0 g biomass g bod 10 2 g biomass g nh4 n and 64 4 g biomass g po4 p respectively these yield values translated to uptake rates of bod nh4 n and po4 p for production of the same amount of biomass as 0 017 g bod d 0 003 g nh4 n d and 0 0005 g po4 p d respectively details included in the appendix lower uptake rate of po4 p relative to bod resulted in longer processing time to attain discharge standards for po4 p therefore po4 p concentration was the controlling factor in determining t a strong correlation was found between predicted and observed cycle times with r2 0 93 0 94 at both vf vc ratios fig 4 the wide spread observed in the cycles with vf vc 500 200 is attributed to proportionally higher n and p concentrations in the feed causing an imbalance in the c n p ratio in the feed vs algal biomass as expected average t in the runs with vf vc 500 200 was higher than that with vf vc 400 300 2 64 days vs 1 41 days sensitivity of the predicted t to the first order kinetic constants kbod knh4 n kpo4 p was evaluated by varying each kinetic constant by 10 one at a time fig 5 illustrates the results of this evaluation from fig 5a and b kbod and knh4 n can be seen to be least sensitive towards t at both vf vc 400 300 and vf vc 500 200 this was further affirmed through sensitivity coefficients δ at vf vc 400 300 sensitivity coefficients for kbod and knh4 n were 0 0038 and 0 0005 respectively at vf vc 500 200 both kbod and knh4 n had zero sensitivity towards t the most sensitive parameter was found to be kpo4 p with δ 0 0109 at vf vc 400 300 and with δ 0 0101 at v f v c 500 200 3 3 prediction of biomass density average biomass yield ybio in the a wwt system calculated from 10 of the fed batch cycles at vf vc of 400 300 was 3 27 g algal biomass per g bod removed this value of ybio was used to predict the effluent biomass density under the two vf vc ratios tested here eqs 5 and 6 in both cases a strong correlation was found between the predicted and measured biomass densities at the end of each cycle fig 6 in the case of vf vc 400 300 predicted biomass densities on day 3 agreed well with the measured values with r2 0 998 rmse 0 04 g l and tic 0 03 0 3 this validated the presumption of linear proportionality between biomass growth and bod removal in the case of vf vc 500 200 predictions were good with r2 0 961 rmse 0 14 g l and tic 0 13 0 3 3 4 utility value of the model ability to predict the fed batch cycle time in advance depending on the influent conditions is a prerequisite for fed batch systems so that the parallel treatment trains could be scheduled accordingly 25 another operational parameter in fed batch systems is the feed culture volume ratio vf vc that could be readily adjusted within certain limits the model developed in this study can aid plant operators in selecting the operating conditions depending on the day to day influent concentrations considering the water quality measures of the influent in this study phosphate concentration was seen as the controlling one in determining the cycle time as such model simulations were integrated to develop a decision support tool as shown in fig 7 while illustrating the limits and sensitivity of the system it can aid in deciding on the feed culture volume ratio vf vc for a desired cycle time or vice versa depending on the influent phosphate concentration 3 5 previous modeling studies on algal wastewater treatment related studies reported in the literature for predicting nutrient removal uptake and biomass growth under varying feed conditions and with different algal strains are summarized in table a3 in the si section removal or uptake of major wastewater contaminants including nitrogen nh4 n no3 n tn phosphorus po4 p tp and carbon bod cod hco3 has been modeled using modified gompertz model 26 27 luedeking piret like equation 28 michaelis menten model 29 caperon mayer model 30 droop model 30 modified stover kincannon model 31 and quiroga sales kinetic model 32 most reported models typically utilize 3 5 model parameters and have been applied to lab scale systems in comparison the current study demonstrated simulation of bod nh4 n and po4 p under field conditions r2 0 97 for bod r2 0 90 for nh4 n r2 0 95 for po4 p using a simple first order kinetic model utilizing three model parameters first order kinetic model has also been applied by liu et al 2017 and silva et al 2015 to predict temporal variations of nh4 n and po4 p with r2 0 9 but in laboratory scale studies 27 33 growth kinetics of microalgae cultivated in various wastewater sources have been studied previously via verlhust logistic kinetic model 28 32 34 first order growth kinetic model 27 33 monod model 30 35 logistic model 36 37 gompertz model and richards model 36 these models utilized 3 12 model parameters and were calibrated and validated under laboratory conditions quality of fit of these models has been assessed in terms of correlation coefficient r2 theil s inequality coefficient tic variance s2 root mean square error rmse or by comparing the kinetic coefficients with literature values the current study simulated temporal variation of biomass density under field conditions with reasonable accuracy r2 0 96 to 0 998 utilizing 3 model parameters and considering linear proportionality of carbon removal to biomass production 3 6 performance of a wwt system based on kinetic modeling the emergent mixotrophic a wwt system differs from other classical algal based wastewater treatment systems in many ways e g algal strain metabolism culture conditions operation scale feed etc 38 therefore it is acknowledged that a direct comparison of outcomes of the current study with previous studies is not feasible yet selected overall measures are used here to compare the a wwt system with related work reported in the literature to identify opportunities and limitations based on modeling results the a wwt system could attain discharge standards for nh4 n and po4 p within an average fed batch processing time of 18 5 h and 32 8 h respectively for 400 300 operation of primary treated wastewater process time for po4 p increased to 63 4 h in 500 200 operation in contrast a study by arbib et al reported much longer times to reach standards for total nitrogen tn and phosphorus p table 1 32 average biomass growth determined in the current study was lower than the values reported for laboratory scale batch experiments utilizing chlorella vulgaris chlorella kessleri scencedesmus obliquus natural bloom chlorella stigmatophora and chlorella stigmatophora 28 32 34 and greater than those reported by lam et al for varying ph conditions 36 4 conclusions the modeling approach presented here based on first order removal kinetics is capable of predicting effluent concentrations of bod nh4 n po4 p and biomass as well as the fed batch cycle time reasonably well under two feed to culture volume ratios predictive ability of the model developed here is comparable to or better than that of the models reported in the literature but with fewer model parameters model simulations enabled development of a decision support tool for use by

reduction in that cycle n is the number of fed batch cycles ybio is the biomass yield xt is the dry density of biomass in the a wwt system at any time t x0 is the initial dry density of biomass immediately after mixing and δ bodt is the reduction in the bod concentration at any time t dry density data collected from 10 fed batch cycles operated with vf vc 400 300 was used to estimate the biomass yield ybio under field conditions then additional data collected with vf vc 400 300 and vf vc 500 200 were used to validate the model and the presumption of linear proportionality of biomass growth to bod reduction eq 7 which was derived previously based on laboratory scale experiments was used to convert optical density measurements at 750 nm wavelength od750 into dry density of biomass

collection an overview of the pilot scale configuration of the a wwt system is included in the supplementary information si section details of the operation of the system are well documented elsewhere 1 3 briefly fed batch operation of the system consisting of 2 700 l reactors was as follows each fed batch cycle was initiated by adding the feed volume of vf to the reactor containing algal cultures of volume vc remaining from the previous cycle to make up a total working volume of 700 l and depth of 20 cm once the reactor concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p reached the discharge standards a volume of 700 vc of the reactor contents was discharged and a new cycle was initiated with a fresh charge of the feed of volume vf following our early testing of the a wwt system in batch mode with vf vc of 400 300 1 the system was switched to fed batch mode with the same vf vc of 400 300 3 in the current study performance of the system under a higher blending ratio vf vc of 500 200 was tested and compared with that recorded at vf vc of 400 300 typical water quality characteristics of the primary effluent are detailed in the si section 2 3 water quality monitoring samples were collected daily from the a wwt system to analyze water quality nh4 n and po4 p were measured daily using a hach dr 6000 spectrophotometer following salicylate method 8155 and phosver3 method 8048 respectively bod was measured once in two days following standard method 5210 b optical density at 750 nm wavelength od750 was used as a surrogate parameter to evaluate algal biomass growth during the fed batch treatment od750 was measured with a hach dr 6000 spectrophotometer 1 cm cuvette 3 results discussions 3 1 prediction of bod nh4 n and po4 p data collected during fed batch operation of the a wwt system fed with primary effluent at vf vc 400 300 2 reactors 20 cycles each and at vf vc 500 200 2 reactors 13 cycles each were used to validate the model developed here since the a wwt system was able to attain the discharge standards for bod within 2 days of fed batch operation bod concentrations were measured only on the second day as shown in fig 1 predicted bod values correlated well with the measured values with r2 0 97 n 40 at vf vc of 400 300 the lower rmse value of 3 74 mg l 12 of the discharge standard and the tic of 0 09 0 3 for the predicted bod concentration on day 2 indicate reasonable validity of the model model simulations indicated that the a wwt system can attain discharge standards for bod 30 mg l within an average processing time of 0 76 0 43 days fig 2 a summarizes measured and predicted day to day concentrations of nh4 n for three days over the 40 cycles run with vf vc of 400 300 predicted daily concentrations of nh4 n showed reasonable correlation with the measured values with an overall r2 0 90 n 120 overall rmse value of 2 77 mg l was comparable with our previous study accounting cycle by cycle prediction of daily nh4 n concentrations 14 tic value of 0 19 0 3 for daily predicted nh4 n concentrations for the 40 cycles suggests reasonable validity of the model 17 average fed batch processing time required to reach discharge standards for nh4 n was 0 77 0 27 days fig 2b summarizes measured and predicted day to day concentrations of po4 p over the 40 cycles run with vf vc of 400 300 correlation between the predicted and measured values was strong with an overall r2 0 95 n 120 overall rmse and the tic values for daily predicted po4 p concentrations were 0 29 mg l and 0 14 0 3 respectively for the 40 cycles average fed batch processing time required to reach discharge standards for po4 was 1 37 0 46 days overall daily predictions of bod nh4 n and po4 p in the current model are better than those of our previous model for the a wwt system bod r2 0 70 n 30 nh4 n r2 0 82 n 90 po4 p r2 0 87 n 90 based on data obtained with vf vc 400 300 14 the current version of the model is a refined one in that it accounts for continuous operation of sequence of fed batch cycles whereas the previous one predicted the performance cycle by cycle 14 in addition inputs to the model in the previous version were the initial concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p immediately after mixing of the feed and the cultures the current model uses the concentrations in the feed i e pe as the inputs predictive ability of the model was further evaluated using the data collected with vf vc of 500 200 here the model was applied using the same first order kinetic coefficients derived from the runs with vf vc 400 300 fig 3 depicts the correlation between the predicted concentrations of bod nh4 n and po4 p and the corresponding values measured at the end of each fed batch cycle even though no adjustments were made to the kinetic coefficients predictions of bod and po4 p concentrations can be seen to be acceptable with tic values of 0 25 0 3 and 0 29 0 3 respectively but was poor in the case of nh4 n with tic value of 0 39 0 3 overall rmse values of daily predicted bod nh4 n and po4 p were 11 29 mg l 6 39 mg l and 1 4 mg l respectively as expected these runs with vf vc 500 200 necessitated longer fed batch processing times to attain discharge standards for bod 0 66 0 54 days nh4 n 0 70 0 37 days and po4 p 2 36 0 64 days substrate uptake removal and biomass productivity are reported to be influenced by characteristics of the cultivation medium e g carbon and nutrient loading temperature solar irradiance etc 19 22 imbalance in the stoichiometric c n p composition of algal biomass and that in the feed water can result in disproportionality in substrate removal 2 22 unlike in the fed batch operations with vf vc 400 300 the stoichiometric c n 5 1 and c p 32 1 ratios in galdieria sulphuraria matched poorly with those in the feed water with vf vc 500 200 c n 2 1 and c p 6 1 this mismatch of carbon and nutrients might have resulted in poor removal of n and p relative to c and thereby contributed to moderate prediction of po4 p and poor prediction of nh4 n for vf vc 500 200 in the current model which utilizes kinetic coefficients derived from runs with vf vc 400 300 in addition to differences in algal growth characteristics smaller sample size considered 26 vs 40 fed batch cycles might have contributed to slightly higher rmse values for fed batch operation with vf vc of 500 200 compared to those with 400 300 23 3 2 prediction of cycle time t for efficient operation of fed batch systems it is essential to know in advance the cycle time to meet the discharge standards under varying influent concentrations according to the model predictions in most of the cycles the time required to reach standards was highest for po4 p and lowest for bod irrespective of the variations in the feed composition this disparity can be explained by the different substrate uptake rates of the algal biomass rates at which carbon and nutrients are utilized by algal biomass depend on the stoichiometric carbon and nutrient requirements metabolic characteristics of the species and environmental conditions e g temperature ph medium etc 24 based on the stochiometric formula for galdieria sulphuraria biomass yield y with respect to c n and p are estimated as 2 0 g biomass g bod 10 2 g biomass g nh4 n and 64 4 g biomass g po4 p respectively these yield values translated to uptake rates of bod nh4 n and po4 p for production of the same amount of biomass as 0 017 g bod d 0 003 g nh4 n d and 0 0005 g po4 p d respectively details included in the appendix lower uptake rate of po4 p relative to bod resulted in longer processing time to attain discharge standards for po4 p therefore po4 p concentration was the controlling factor in determining t a strong correlation was found between predicted and observed cycle times with r2 0 93 0 94 at both vf vc ratios fig 4 the wide spread observed in the cycles with vf vc 500 200 is attributed to proportionally higher n and p concentrations in the feed causing an imbalance in the c n p ratio in the feed vs algal biomass as expected average t in the runs with vf vc 500 200 was higher than that with vf vc 400 300 2 64 days vs 1 41 days sensitivity of the predicted t to the first order kinetic constants kbod knh4 n kpo4 p was evaluated by varying each kinetic constant by 10 one at a time fig 5 illustrates the results of this evaluation from fig 5a and b kbod and knh4 n can be seen to be least sensitive towards t at both vf vc 400 300 and vf vc 500 200 this was further affirmed through sensitivity coefficients δ at vf vc 400 300 sensitivity coefficients for kbod and knh4 n were 0 0038 and 0 0005 respectively at vf vc 500 200 both kbod and knh4 n had zero sensitivity towards t the most sensitive parameter was found to be kpo4 p with δ 0 0109 at vf vc 400 300 and with δ 0 0101 at v f v c 500 200 3 3 prediction of biomass density average biomass yield ybio in the a wwt system calculated from 10 of the fed batch cycles at vf vc of 400 300 was 3 27 g algal biomass per g bod removed this value of ybio was used to predict the effluent biomass density under the two vf vc ratios tested here eqs 5 and 6 in both cases a strong correlation was found between the predicted and measured biomass densities at the end of each cycle fig 6 in the case of vf vc 400 300 predicted biomass densities on day 3 agreed well with the measured values with r2 0 998 rmse 0 04 g l and tic 0 03 0 3 this validated the presumption of linear proportionality between biomass growth and bod removal in the case of vf vc 500 200 predictions were good with r2 0 961 rmse 0 14 g l and tic 0 13 0 3 3 4 utility value of the model ability to predict the fed batch cycle time in advance depending on the influent conditions is a prerequisite for fed batch systems so that the parallel treatment trains could be scheduled accordingly 25 another operational parameter in fed batch systems is the feed culture volume ratio vf vc that could be readily adjusted within certain limits the model developed in this study can aid plant operators in selecting the operating conditions depending on the day to day influent concentrations considering the water quality measures of the influent in this study phosphate concentration was seen as the controlling one in determining the cycle time as such model simulations were integrated to develop a decision support tool as shown in fig 7 while illustrating the limits and sensitivity of the system it can aid in deciding on the feed culture volume ratio vf vc for a desired cycle time or vice versa depending on the influent phosphate concentration 3 5 previous modeling studies on algal wastewater treatment related studies reported in the literature for predicting nutrient removal uptake and biomass growth under varying feed conditions and with different algal strains are summarized in table a3 in the si section removal or uptake of major wastewater contaminants including nitrogen nh4 n no3 n tn phosphorus po4 p tp and carbon bod cod hco3 has been modeled using modified gompertz model 26 27 luedeking piret like equation 28 michaelis menten model 29 caperon mayer model 30 droop model 30 modified stover kincannon model 31 and quiroga sales kinetic model 32 most reported models typically utilize 3 5 model parameters and have been applied to lab scale systems in comparison the current study demonstrated simulation of bod nh4 n and po4 p under field conditions r2 0 97 for bod r2 0 90 for nh4 n r2 0 95 for po4 p using a simple first order kinetic model utilizing three model parameters first order kinetic model has also been applied by liu et al 2017 and silva et al 2015 to predict temporal variations of nh4 n and po4 p with r2 0 9 but in laboratory scale studies 27 33 growth kinetics of microalgae cultivated in various wastewater sources have been studied previously via verlhust logistic kinetic model 28 32 34 first order growth kinetic model 27 33 monod model 30 35 logistic model 36 37 gompertz model and richards model 36 these models utilized 3 12 model parameters and were calibrated and validated under laboratory conditions quality of fit of these models has been assessed in terms of correlation coefficient r2 theil s inequality coefficient tic variance s2 root mean square error rmse or by comparing the kinetic coefficients with literature values the current study simulated temporal variation of biomass density under field conditions with reasonable accuracy r2 0 96 to 0 998 utilizing 3 model parameters and considering linear proportionality of carbon removal to biomass production 3 6 performance of a wwt system based on kinetic modeling the emergent mixotrophic a wwt system differs from other classical algal based wastewater treatment systems in many ways e g algal strain metabolism culture conditions operation scale feed etc 38 therefore it is acknowledged that a direct comparison of outcomes of the current study with previous studies is not feasible yet selected overall measures are used here to compare the a wwt system with related work reported in the literature to identify opportunities and limitations based on modeling results the a wwt system could attain discharge standards for nh4 n and po4 p within an average fed batch processing time of 18 5 h and 32 8 h respectively for 400 300 operation of primary treated wastewater process time for po4 p increased to 63 4 h in 500 200 operation in contrast a study by arbib et al reported much longer times to reach standards for total nitrogen tn and phosphorus p table 1 32 average biomass growth determined in the current study was lower than the values reported for laboratory scale batch experiments utilizing chlorella vulgaris chlorella kessleri scencedesmus obliquus natural bloom chlorella stigmatophora and chlorella stigmatophora 28 32 34 and greater than those reported by lam et al for varying ph conditions 36 4 conclusions the modeling approach presented here based on first order removal kinetics is capable of predicting effluent concentrations of bod nh4 n po4 p and biomass as well as the fed batch cycle time reasonably well under two feed to culture volume ratios predictive ability of the model developed here is comparable to or better than that of the models reported in the literature but with fewer model parameters model simulations enabled development of a decision support tool for use by

13816,in this study the internal circulation iron carbon micro electrolysis ice method was combined with activated sludge as to form micro electrolysis biological fluidized bed mbfb process for the treatment of coking wastewater with a low carbon to nitrogen c n ratio the mbfb process has chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen removal rates of 92 and 95 respectively which is much higher than those of the ice process and single as process the results of three dimensional fluorescence spectra showed that the mbfb process can not only remove protein like substances but can also degrade fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances fe2 fe3 and active hydrogen atoms promoted the electron transfer inside and outside the microbial cells thereby enhancing the metabolism of the microorganisms such as acidovorax which is beneficial to the degradation of organics and nutriments therefore the mbfb process has synergistic degradation properties and is promising for treating industrial wastewaters with low c n ratios keywords internal circulation iron carbon micro electrolysis ice biological process coking wastewater microbial community structure micro electrolysis biological fluidized bed mbfb 1 introduction with the development of petroleum chemical and steel industries the demand for coke is increasing during coke production a large amount of coking wastewater is produced 1 coking wastewater contains mineral oil cyanide phenol and benzene compounds and high amounts of nitrogen 2 4 which affect the soil environment and aquatic ecosystems therefore coking wastewater should be effectively treated before being discharged the treatments for coking wastewater mainly include physical chemical and biochemical processes physical and chemical processes can be easily operated but are expensive biochemical processes are widely used in treating urban and industrial wastewaters owing to low operating costs 5 biochemical processes such as the anoxic oxic ao process and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process 5 usually require denitrification properties to effectively remove total nitrogen tn from coking wastewater nitrate can be reduced only from 135 to 85 3 mg l using the ao process 6 probably because of the low carbon to nitrogen c n ratio of the wastewater 7 a low c n ratio can often lead to the formation of nitrous oxide during the biological denitrification process 8 usually when the c n ratio of wastewater is high heterotrophic denitrification is the main method used for nitrate removal 9 heterotrophic denitrification processes often require large amounts of organic matter as the electron donor for microbial growth however coking wastewater has a low c n ratio usually below 2 0 8 but in fact it has a better removal effect on nitrogen when c n ratio is above 5 0 10 and contains relatively fewer electrons therefore additional organics such as methanol or glucose need to be added for treating coking wastewater 10 this increases the operating costs in the presence of inorganic electron donors in wastewater such as hydrogen iron and sulfur compounds 11 12 autotrophic denitrification which has a high nitrate removal efficiency 10 is an effective method for nitrate removal particularly for wastewater with a low c n ratio 13 some researchers have considered zero valent iron as an electron donor for denitrification to enhance the removal rate of nitrogen 14 15 for industrial wastewater treatment activated carbon is used to form a primary battery with iron thereby effectively accelerating the electron donating ability of iron and enhancing the reduction of oxidized substances this process is called iron carbon micro electrolysis ie 16 it can degrade the pollutants by the action of redox flocculation and adsorption 17 the ie process is widely used to treat refractory industrial wastewater owing to the formation of high active substances such as fe2 active hydrogen and oh radicals elemental iron is corroded to produce fe2 and active reduced hydrogen reaction 1 and reaction 3 under aeration conditions fe2 is easily oxidized to form fe3 eventually forming a hydroxide colloid reaction 2 that exhibits excellent flocculation performance 1 fe 2 e fe 2 2 4fe 2 8 oh o 2 2h 2 o 4fe oh 3 3 2 h 2 e 2 h h 2 the active hydrogen and fe2 produced in the ie process can be used as an electron donor to promote the growth of autotrophic denitrification microorganisms which is beneficial to the removal of nitrogen from industrial wastewater with a low c n ratio 10 12 therefore the ie process is used to reduce nitrate by combining with biological denitrification 13 in the studies the iron and carbon were usually fixed in the reactor this caused hardening blocking and passivation of the iron carbon mixture to overcome these problems an internal circulation micro electrolysis ice reactor was developed 18 the operating principle of the reactor is to gather dispersed air into draft tube the iron carbon and water are carried by the gas flow which leads to a pressure difference between the riser and down comer it can clean the iron carbon granules of surface passivation because of the interphase force which can overcome the disadvantages of the ie process therefore the reactor is often used in industrial wastewater treatment and exhibited an excellent performance 18 20 computational fluid dynamics and experimental results showed that the ice reactor has both oxidation and reduction functions 19 20 the activity on the surface of iron in the ice reactor can be maintained at all times under the influence of grinding thus enhancing the generation of fe2 and active hydrogen which are beneficial for the autotrophic denitrification of nitrate in coking wastewater 21 therefore the ice process can improve the biodegradability of refractory wastewater 22 while enriching functional anaerobic microorganisms 23 in this study a novel integrated process comprising ice and a biological treatment was developed namely the micro electrolysis biological fluidized bed mbfb technology the iron carbon mixture and activated sludge were combined into the ice reactor for removing tn from the coking wastewater the performance of the mbfb process was studied in comparison with those of activated sludge as and ice process the degradation of tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod present in coking wastewater was investigated the microbial community and organic compounds were studied to determine the synergistic mechanism between ice reaction and biological degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw coking wastewater which was stripped with ammonia was obtained from a coal coking plant located in inner mongolia china the characteristics of the raw coking wastewater were as follows 3000 4000 mg l of cod 600 1000 mg l of biological oxygen demand bod5 300 500 mg l of tn 200 300 mg l of nh4 n and 7 5 8 5 of ph prior to the experiment the raw wastewater was diluted with tap water to the required concentration and was added to the trace elements for microbial growth 2 the activated sludge for inoculation was collected from the aerobic pool of a coking wastewater plant the iron scraps used in the experiment were taken from the metalworking facilities of our institution they were sieved through a 20 mesh sieve the sieved iron craps were dipped in a 10 naoh solution for 2 h soaked with a 5 hcl solution for 30 min and then washed with tap water until the ph was close to neutral 19 the activated carbon ac 1 2 mm were purchased from hebei pengcheng activated carbon co ltd the ac was first rinsed with tap water and then soaked in the coking wastewater until the adsorption of the ac reached saturation 2 2 reactor and operation procedure several identical reactors the structure of which is described in detail in our research 18 were used in the experiment the reactor with an inner circulation tube fig 1 is made of glass and its volume is 1000 ml the volume of iron and carbon with a ratio of 1 1 v v was 50 ml for ice and mbfb processes the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss of the activated sludge was 3000 mg l for mbfb and as processes the reactions were carried out in a sequencing batch reactor model the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h at room temperature for all the reactors the sludge retention time srt of the as and mbfb processes is 20 d for the mbfb process if iron and carbon are taken out during the process of sludge removal the taken out iron and carbon will be separated and re introduced into the reactor 2 3 analytical methods cod closed reﬂux titrimetric method bod5 inoculation dilution method nh4 n nessler s reagent spectrophotometry and mlss weight method were measured by using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 24 no2 and no3 were determined by ion chromatography ic dionex america tn was obtained using a tn analyzer the three dimensional 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrices eem spectra of the coking wastewater were determined using a 3d ﬂuorescence spectrometer horiba fl max 4 p the eem spectra was obtained by scanning over excitation ex wavelengths ranging from 250 to 550 nm at 1 nm increments and emission em wavelengths ranging from 250 to 450 nm at 10 nm increments 25 2 4 microbial community analysis the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community structure of the biomass sampled in all the reactors after conducting the experiment the dna of the three samples extracted using a dna extraction kit e z n a soil dna kit was pcr amplified using 16s rrna gene v3 v4 region with 314 f and 805r the miseq illumina was used to sequence the above pcr products obtained from beijing aoke dingsheng biological technology co ltd beijing china the obtained sequences with 97 similarity were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the uparse software program uparse v7 0 1001 http drive 5 com uparse the classification of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed using the rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu115 16s rrna database based on a 70 confidence threshold 13 the shannon and simpson indices were used to quantify the diversity of the microbial community and the chao and ace indices were used to evaluate the richness 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the mbfb process to determine the performance of the mbfb process the degradation of coking wastewater was carried out using as ice and mbfb processes for over 110 days fig 2 shows the variations in the cod nh4 n tn and no3 n concentrations over time with ice mbfb and as processes under different influent concentrations fig 2 a shows that as the influent cod concentration increases from 400 to 1000 mg l the effluent cod concentration with the mbfb process increases gradually but remains below 110 mg l the effluent cod concentration of ice and as processes shows a gradual upward trend when the influent cod concentration exceeds 1000 mg l the effluent cod with the as process increases sharply even exceeding 600 mg l in addition the cod removal rate of the mbfb process increases from about 84 at an influent cod concentration of 400 mg l to about 92 at an influent cod concentration of 1000 mg l however the removal rate of cod in the as process decreases from about 75 at an influent cod concentration of 400 mg l to about 40 at an influent cod concentration of 1000 mg l this may be because as the cod concentration increases that the concentration of microbial toxic substances in coking wastewater will also increase thereby inhibiting the growth and reproduction of microorganisms therefore the as process is not suitable for treating the coking wastewater with a high cod concentration the mbfb process has a higher impact load resistance than the single as process for cod which is beneficial for the long term stable operation of the wastewater treatment plant as shown in fig 2 b although the influent nh4 n concentration increases from 38 to 100 mg l the effluent nh4 n concentration in mbfb and as processes is maintained below 5 mg l the effluent nh4 n concentration in the ice process gradually increases with the increase in the nh4 n concentration of the influent and the removal rate decreases gradually from 50 to 38 this shows that the biological treatment process can effectively remove nh4 n as shown in fig 2 c the tn concentration of the effluent treated using the mbfb process increases slightly with the increase in the influent tn but remains below 20 mg l the tn concentration of the effluent treated using as and ice processes increases significantly with the increase in the influent tn concentration this shows that the mbfb process can help synergistically degrade tn the no3 n concentration in the effluent was also examined fig 2 d shows the results the effluent no3 n concentration treated using ice and mbfb processes is maintained below 10 mg l this may be because the ice process can reduce the nitrate nitrogen produced in the process to n2 41 interestingly the no3 n concentration of the effluent treated using the as process is significantly higher than that of the influent this indicates that the as process cannot remove no3 n but can convert other nitrogen into no3 n based on the above results of nh4 n tn and no3 n it can be concluded that the mbfb process has a strong denitrification capacity therefore the mbfb process exhibits an excellent performance in removing not only organic matters but also nitrogen containing substances 3 2 influence of aeration rate aeration in the mbfb process can not only improve the degradation of pollutants and solve its hardening problem of iron carbon mixture but also facilitate microbial degradation 2 however excess aeration is not conducive to the formation of the micro battery between iron and carbon 18 and the microorganisms age easily in a biological treatment process 26 therefore it is necessary to investigate the effect of aeration on the degradation of cod nh4 n tn and no3 n considering as the cod of the influent wastewater exceeds 800 mg l the removal rate of cod by the as process is significantly reduced in order to be comparable a cod concentration of about 800 mg l was selected as the influent concentration for the degradation of coking wastewater using the ice mbfb and as processes fig 3 shows the effect of aeration rate on the degradation of cod nh4 n tn and no3 n using the three processes fig 3 a shows that the cod concentration of the effluent treated using the three processes first decreases with the increase in the aeration rate and then increases the cod of the effluent treated using as and ice processes is lowest at an aeration rate of 0 5 m3 h and reduced to 220 mg l and 237 mg l respectively whereas the cod of the effluent treated by the mbfb process is the lowest at an aeration rate of 0 6 m3 h and its value is reduced below 90 mg l which is much lower than the lowest cod of the effluent treated by as and ice processes this indicates that the mbfb process has higher organic removal efficiency for the treatment of coking wastewater this is mainly because the increase in aeration can not only enhance the redox reaction of ie 27 but can also accelerate microbial activity in addition aeration can provide a circulating driving power for the iron carbon filler and activated sludge in the reactor thereby enhancing the mass transfer and synergistic effect of micro electrolysis and biodegradation 2 however excess aeration not only make the contact iron and carbon easy to separate which is not conducive to the formation of the micro battery reaction between iron and ac 18 but also tends to cause aging of the microorganisms this is not conducive to the degradation of organic matter resulting in an increase in the cod concentration of the effluent the aeration rate has the same effect on nh4 n tn and cod removal the removal effect of nh4 n by the mbfb process is similar to that by the as process fig 3 b whereas the mbfb and ice processes have similar removal effects on no3 n at all aeration rates fig 3 d however only the mbfb process has a high removal effect on tn at all aeration rates fig 3 c when the aeration rate is 0 5 m3 h the mbfb process has a tn removal rate of 95 which is much higher than those of the ice process 46 and the as process 55 this confirms that the mbfb process can help synergistically degrade tn at all aeration rates 3 3 organic matter analyses with 3d ﬂuorescence spectra the organic matter before and after treating the coking wastewater using ice mbfb and as processes for 12 h was characterized by 3d fluorescence spectroscopy as shown in fig 4 according to chen et al the eem spectrum can be divided into regions i ii ii iv and v which are regarded as aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humic acid like respectively 28 except for rayleigh and raman scattering the raw sewage shows some peaks in these five regions particularly when ex em is in the ranges of 200 230 270 340 nm 260 280 280 320 nm and 200 220 550 600 nm as shown in fig 4 a this indicates the presence of a large number of pollutants with complex composition in the raw coking wastewater as shown in fig 4 b although the fluorescence intensity of the organic matter in the coking wastewater treated using the ice process is significantly reduced owing to the effects of redox reaction and flocculation the organic substances in the five regions do not completely disappear the same is true for the as process as shown in fig 4 c therefore both ice and as processes have limited degradation effects on the coking wastewater however the mbfb process largely eliminates the organic matter in all the regions except for region i aromatic protein i and the fluorescence intensity of the organic matter in region i is remarkably lowered from 2951 to 312 au at an ex em of 200 290 nm as shown in fig 4 d many studies have shown that humic acid like and fulvic acid like substances cannot be degraded by microorganisms 29 30 but can easily be removed by flocculation 31 32 therefore the ice process plays a key role in the degradation of coking wastewater using the mbfb process 3 4 microorganism community analysis to investigate the effects of ice technology on microorganisms the characteristics of the microbial community structure in mbfb and as processes were studied by high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing rarefaction curves of the microorganism community obtained from the as and mbfb processes almost close to flat as shown in fig 5 indicating that the sequencing results obtained reliably presented almost the otus 33 the ace chao and shannon indexes table 1 of the microorganism community in the as process were higher than those of the microorganism community in the mbfb process while the simpson index of the microorganism community in the as process was lower than that of the microorganism community in the mbfb process these indicate that mbfb process reduced the richness and diversity of the micorbial community however it can be seen from fig 6 that the mbfb process effectively improved the growth of acidification and denitrification microorganisms for the coking wastewater fig 6 shows the taxonomic classification of the microbial communities at the phylum and genus levels in mbfb and as processes the relative abundance of the microbial species in the different samples reflects the structural composition of the community the dominant species of microorganisms observed in as and mbfb processes is proteobacteria which has a relative abundance of 85 9 and 89 2 respectively as shown in fig 6 a proteobacteria is considered an important species for the degradation of refractory organic compounds in industrial wastewater 2 bacteroidetes is the second dominant microorganism in the as process the relative abundance of which is 5 04 its abundance is only 1 71 in the mbfb process indicating that the mbfb technology inhibits the growth of bacteroidetes microorganisms the abundance of actinobacteria microorganisms increased from 1 1 in the as process to 3 2 in the mbfb process indicating that the mbfb technology is beneficial to the growth of actinobacteria microorganisms actinobacteria microorganisms are considered a dominant strain for denitrification 34 the relative abundance of chloroflexi increased from 0 8 in the as process to 1 4 in the mbfb process chloroflexi plays an important role in the removal of nutrients e g nh4 n from wastewater 35 the above results show that the mbfb process can effectively reduce no3 n in coking wastewater to nitrogen resulting in an increase in chloroflexi abundance in the mbfb process this is consistent with the removal results of tn obtained under various conditions as previously mentioned fig 6 b shows that acinetobacter and acidovorax are the major genera in as and mbfb processes acinetobacter is effective for the degradation of alkane based organic pollutants which are widely found in various refinery wastewater treatment systems 36 the relative abundance of acinetobacter reduced from 48 0 in the as process to 44 9 in the mbfb process this could be because the mbfb technology effectively reduces the amount of alkanes in coking wastewater the relative abundance of acidovorax increased from 9 1 in the as process to 16 4 in the mbfb process acidovorax is an anaerobic iron oxidizing bacterium aib 37 38 which is beneficial for the degradation of no3 n 13 this indicates that the mbfb process has an anaerobic environment which is consistent with our previous findings 19 the above results show that the mbfb process can effectively reduce no3 n in coking wastewater to nh4 n resulting in an increase in acidovorax abundance in the mbfb process notably the abundance of delftia increased from 0 4 in the as process to 10 5 in the mbfb process delftia can secrete a highly active amide hydrolase that effectively degrades amide contaminants 39 this is beneficial for the degradation of contaminants in the coking wastewater the abundance of brevundimonas which is an effective bacterium for degrading quinoline in coking wastewater 40 significantly improved in the mbfb process from 0 019 in the as process to 1 54 in the mbfb process the mbfb technology can effectively promote extracellular electron transfer 2 thereby degrading the refractory organic compounds in the mbfb process chryseobacterium which is a typical microorganism used in anaerobic fluidized reactors was found in the microbes in the mbfb process oxidation and reduction processes occur simultaneously in the mbfb technology 19 resulting in both anaerobic and aerobic zones in the mbfb process therefore the mbfb process has outstanding denitrification efficiency 3 5 hypothetic degradation mechanism of the mbfb process based on the reactor performance and the above results the hypothetic degradation mechanisms of coking wastewater using the mbfb process were proposed in this study as shown in fig 7 our previous studies have shown that the ice reactor has dual functions of oxidation and reduction 19 41 the oxidation reaction mainly occurs in the riser region of the ice reactor and the reduction reaction mainly occurs in the down comer region in the mbfb process in which microorganisms are present the oxidation and reduction regions described above correspond to the aerobic and anaerobic zones respectively thus they are suitable for treating high nitrogen content industrial wastewater such as coking wastewater in the anaerobic zone the zero valent iron and active hydrogen reaction 3 in the ice process can effectively reduce the nitrate produced by oxidation or one that exists in raw coking wastewater to nitrogen directly 41 at the same time the ferrous ions produced by the ice reaction 1 can effectively promote the growth of microorganisms with nitrate reduction coupled with ferrous iron oxidizing ability 42 such as acidovorax the periplasmic nitrate reductase napa and membrane bound nitrate reductase narg in this microorganism can convert nitrate into nitrogen and simultaneously degrade organic matter 13 in addition the active hydrogen produced by the ice can effectively convert refractory organic matter into biodegradable organic matter thereby providing favorable conditions for the biological treatment of industrial wastewater in the aerobic zone aeration increases the dissolved oxygen in the wastewater and the oxidation potential of the system which are beneficial for the mineralization of organic pollutants at the same time the fresh fe oh n flocs reaction 2 help remove macromolecular insoluble organic matter by flocculation the iron ions produced by the ice are essential for the growth of microorganism and are one of the active components of biological enzymes during the aerobic respiration of microorganisms a variety of anabolic reactions require the reduced coenzyme ii nadph as a reducing agent whereas nadph can be oxidized to coenzyme ii nadp by the removal of electrons nadp can be further reduced by the active h reaction 3 produced by the ice to nadph in this process nadph transfers electrons to flavin adenine dinucleotide fad which consumes hydrogen to form reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide fadh2 nadph and fadh2 are two essential substances in the aerobic oxidation of microorganisms the microbial cells transfer electron through a reversible reaction between fe2 and fe3 in the cytochrome cyt therefore the fe2 fe3 ions generated in the ice technology provides an electron transfer medium for the synthesis of cyt thus promoting the growth and metabolism of microorganisms which are beneficial for the degradation of organic matter therefore the mbfb process has a synergistic effect for the degradation of organic matter and nitrogen present in coking wastewater 3 6 operating cost the operating cost is usually an economic factor that needs to be considered in the actual application of a technical project the operating costs in the mbfb process are mainly electricity cost of iron carbon and other costs the electricity consumption process is mainly the operation of the air pump and the electricity consumption is approximately is about 0 88 kw h per ton of wastewater the electricity charge is 0 75 rmb per kw h so the electricity charge is 0 66 rmb per ton of wastewater the cost of iron carbon is about o 1 rmb per ton of wastewater the other costs mainly include labor cost management cost maintenance cost and it is about 0 2 rmb per ton of wastewater therefore the total operating cost is about 0 96 rmb per ton of wastewater 4 conclusion a novel integrated mbfb process with ice and as processes was feasible to treat the coking wastewater which exhibited cod and tn removal rates of 92 and 95 respectively the mbfb process could not only degrade protein like organics but also remove fulvic and humic like organics the oxidation and reduction functions in the mbfb process provide favorable conditions for aerobic and anaerobic degradation of microorganisms achieving a high tn removal rate and the fe2 and active hydrogen produced in the mbfb process could enrich acidovorax thereby promoting the reduction of nitrate therefore the mbfb process exhibited a strong synergistic effect and can be practically applied to the treatment of industrial wastewater with low c n ratios declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science

13816,in this study the internal circulation iron carbon micro electrolysis ice method was combined with activated sludge as to form micro electrolysis biological fluidized bed mbfb process for the treatment of coking wastewater with a low carbon to nitrogen c n ratio the mbfb process has chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen removal rates of 92 and 95 respectively which is much higher than those of the ice process and single as process the results of three dimensional fluorescence spectra showed that the mbfb process can not only remove protein like substances but can also degrade fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances fe2 fe3 and active hydrogen atoms promoted the electron transfer inside and outside the microbial cells thereby enhancing the metabolism of the microorganisms such as acidovorax which is beneficial to the degradation of organics and nutriments therefore the mbfb process has synergistic degradation properties and is promising for treating industrial wastewaters with low c n ratios keywords internal circulation iron carbon micro electrolysis ice biological process coking wastewater microbial community structure micro electrolysis biological fluidized bed mbfb 1 introduction with the development of petroleum chemical and steel industries the demand for coke is increasing during coke production a large amount of coking wastewater is produced 1 coking wastewater contains mineral oil cyanide phenol and benzene compounds and high amounts of nitrogen 2 4 which affect the soil environment and aquatic ecosystems therefore coking wastewater should be effectively treated before being discharged the treatments for coking wastewater mainly include physical chemical and biochemical processes physical and chemical processes can be easily operated but are expensive biochemical processes are widely used in treating urban and industrial wastewaters owing to low operating costs 5 biochemical processes such as the anoxic oxic ao process and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o process 5 usually require denitrification properties to effectively remove total nitrogen tn from coking wastewater nitrate can be reduced only from 135 to 85 3 mg l using the ao process 6 probably because of the low carbon to nitrogen c n ratio of the wastewater 7 a low c n ratio can often lead to the formation of nitrous oxide during the biological denitrification process 8 usually when the c n ratio of wastewater is high heterotrophic denitrification is the main method used for nitrate removal 9 heterotrophic denitrification processes often require large amounts of organic matter as the electron donor for microbial growth however coking wastewater has a low c n ratio usually below 2 0 8 but in fact it has a better removal effect on nitrogen when c n ratio is above 5 0 10 and contains relatively fewer electrons therefore additional organics such as methanol or glucose need to be added for treating coking wastewater 10 this increases the operating costs in the presence of inorganic electron donors in wastewater such as hydrogen iron and sulfur compounds 11 12 autotrophic denitrification which has a high nitrate removal efficiency 10 is an effective method for nitrate removal particularly for wastewater with a low c n ratio 13 some researchers have considered zero valent iron as an electron donor for denitrification to enhance the removal rate of nitrogen 14 15 for industrial wastewater treatment activated carbon is used to form a primary battery with iron thereby effectively accelerating the electron donating ability of iron and enhancing the reduction of oxidized substances this process is called iron carbon micro electrolysis ie 16 it can degrade the pollutants by the action of redox flocculation and adsorption 17 the ie process is widely used to treat refractory industrial wastewater owing to the formation of high active substances such as fe2 active hydrogen and oh radicals elemental iron is corroded to produce fe2 and active reduced hydrogen reaction 1 and reaction 3 under aeration conditions fe2 is easily oxidized to form fe3 eventually forming a hydroxide colloid reaction 2 that exhibits excellent flocculation performance 1 fe 2 e fe 2 2 4fe 2 8 oh o 2 2h 2 o 4fe oh 3 3 2 h 2 e 2 h h 2 the active hydrogen and fe2 produced in the ie process can be used as an electron donor to promote the growth of autotrophic denitrification microorganisms which is beneficial to the removal of nitrogen from industrial wastewater with a low c n ratio 10 12 therefore the ie process is used to reduce nitrate by combining with biological denitrification 13 in the studies the iron and carbon were usually fixed in the reactor this caused hardening blocking and passivation of the iron carbon mixture to overcome these problems an internal circulation micro electrolysis ice reactor was developed 18 the operating principle of the reactor is to gather dispersed air into draft tube the iron carbon and water are carried by the gas flow which leads to a pressure difference between the riser and down comer it can clean the iron carbon granules of surface passivation because of the interphase force which can overcome the disadvantages of the ie process therefore the reactor is often used in industrial wastewater treatment and exhibited an excellent performance 18 20 computational fluid dynamics and experimental results showed that the ice reactor has both oxidation and reduction functions 19 20 the activity on the surface of iron in the ice reactor can be maintained at all times under the influence of grinding thus enhancing the generation of fe2 and active hydrogen which are beneficial for the autotrophic denitrification of nitrate in coking wastewater 21 therefore the ice process can improve the biodegradability of refractory wastewater 22 while enriching functional anaerobic microorganisms 23 in this study a novel integrated process comprising ice and a biological treatment was developed namely the micro electrolysis biological fluidized bed mbfb technology the iron carbon mixture and activated sludge were combined into the ice reactor for removing tn from the coking wastewater the performance of the mbfb process was studied in comparison with those of activated sludge as and ice process the degradation of tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod present in coking wastewater was investigated the microbial community and organic compounds were studied to determine the synergistic mechanism between ice reaction and biological degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the raw coking wastewater which was stripped with ammonia was obtained from a coal coking plant located in inner mongolia china the characteristics of the raw coking wastewater were as follows 3000 4000 mg l of cod 600 1000 mg l of biological oxygen demand bod5 300 500 mg l of tn 200 300 mg l of nh4 n and 7 5 8 5 of ph prior to the experiment the raw wastewater was diluted with tap water to the required concentration and was added to the trace elements for microbial growth 2 the activated sludge for inoculation was collected from the aerobic pool of a coking wastewater plant the iron scraps used in the experiment were taken from the metalworking facilities of our institution they were sieved through a 20 mesh sieve the sieved iron craps were dipped in a 10 naoh solution for 2 h soaked with a 5 hcl solution for 30 min and then washed with tap water until the ph was close to neutral 19 the activated carbon ac 1 2 mm were purchased from hebei pengcheng activated carbon co ltd the ac was first rinsed with tap water and then soaked in the coking wastewater until the adsorption of the ac reached saturation 2 2 reactor and operation procedure several identical reactors the structure of which is described in detail in our research 18 were used in the experiment the reactor with an inner circulation tube fig 1 is made of glass and its volume is 1000 ml the volume of iron and carbon with a ratio of 1 1 v v was 50 ml for ice and mbfb processes the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss of the activated sludge was 3000 mg l for mbfb and as processes the reactions were carried out in a sequencing batch reactor model the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h at room temperature for all the reactors the sludge retention time srt of the as and mbfb processes is 20 d for the mbfb process if iron and carbon are taken out during the process of sludge removal the taken out iron and carbon will be separated and re introduced into the reactor 2 3 analytical methods cod closed reﬂux titrimetric method bod5 inoculation dilution method nh4 n nessler s reagent spectrophotometry and mlss weight method were measured by using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 24 no2 and no3 were determined by ion chromatography ic dionex america tn was obtained using a tn analyzer the three dimensional 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrices eem spectra of the coking wastewater were determined using a 3d ﬂuorescence spectrometer horiba fl max 4 p the eem spectra was obtained by scanning over excitation ex wavelengths ranging from 250 to 550 nm at 1 nm increments and emission em wavelengths ranging from 250 to 450 nm at 10 nm increments 25 2 4 microbial community analysis the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing was used to analyze the microbial community structure of the biomass sampled in all the reactors after conducting the experiment the dna of the three samples extracted using a dna extraction kit e z n a soil dna kit was pcr amplified using 16s rrna gene v3 v4 region with 314 f and 805r the miseq illumina was used to sequence the above pcr products obtained from beijing aoke dingsheng biological technology co ltd beijing china the obtained sequences with 97 similarity were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the uparse software program uparse v7 0 1001 http drive 5 com uparse the classification of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed using the rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu115 16s rrna database based on a 70 confidence threshold 13 the shannon and simpson indices were used to quantify the diversity of the microbial community and the chao and ace indices were used to evaluate the richness 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the mbfb process to determine the performance of the mbfb process the degradation of coking wastewater was carried out using as ice and mbfb processes for over 110 days fig 2 shows the variations in the cod nh4 n tn and no3 n concentrations over time with ice mbfb and as processes under different influent concentrations fig 2 a shows that as the influent cod concentration increases from 400 to 1000 mg l the effluent cod concentration with the mbfb process increases gradually but remains below 110 mg l the effluent cod concentration of ice and as processes shows a gradual upward trend when the influent cod concentration exceeds 1000 mg l the effluent cod with the as process increases sharply even exceeding 600 mg l in addition the cod removal rate of the mbfb process increases from about 84 at an influent cod concentration of 400 mg l to about 92 at an influent cod concentration of 1000 mg l however the removal rate of cod in the as process decreases from about 75 at an influent cod concentration of 400 mg l to about 40 at an influent cod concentration of 1000 mg l this may be because as the cod concentration increases that the concentration of microbial toxic substances in coking wastewater will also increase thereby inhibiting the growth and reproduction of microorganisms therefore the as process is not suitable for treating the coking wastewater with a high cod concentration the mbfb process has a higher impact load resistance than the single as process for cod which is beneficial for the long term stable operation of the wastewater treatment plant as shown in fig 2 b although the influent nh4 n concentration increases from 38 to 100 mg l the effluent nh4 n concentration in mbfb and as processes is maintained below 5 mg l the effluent nh4 n concentration in the ice process gradually increases with the increase in the nh4 n concentration of the influent and the removal rate decreases gradually from 50 to 38 this shows that the biological treatment process can effectively remove nh4 n as shown in fig 2 c the tn concentration of the effluent treated using the mbfb process increases slightly with the increase in the influent tn but remains below 20 mg l the tn concentration of the effluent treated using as and ice processes increases significantly with the increase in the influent tn concentration this shows that the mbfb process can help synergistically degrade tn the no3 n concentration in the effluent was also examined fig 2 d shows the results the effluent no3 n concentration treated using ice and mbfb processes is maintained below 10 mg l this may be because the ice process can reduce the nitrate nitrogen produced in the process to n2 41 interestingly the no3 n concentration of the effluent treated using the as process is significantly higher than that of the influent this indicates that the as process cannot remove no3 n but can convert other nitrogen into no3 n based on the above results of nh4 n tn and no3 n it can be concluded that the mbfb process has a strong denitrification capacity therefore the mbfb process exhibits an excellent performance in removing not only organic matters but also nitrogen containing substances 3 2 influence of aeration rate aeration in the mbfb process can not only improve the degradation of pollutants and solve its hardening problem of iron carbon mixture but also facilitate microbial degradation 2 however excess aeration is not conducive to the formation of the micro battery between iron and carbon 18 and the microorganisms age easily in a biological treatment process 26 therefore it is necessary to investigate the effect of aeration on the degradation of cod nh4 n tn and no3 n considering as the cod of the influent wastewater exceeds 800 mg l the removal rate of cod by the as process is significantly reduced in order to be comparable a cod concentration of about 800 mg l was selected as the influent concentration for the degradation of coking wastewater using the ice mbfb and as processes fig 3 shows the effect of aeration rate on the degradation of cod nh4 n tn and no3 n using the three processes fig 3 a shows that the cod concentration of the effluent treated using the three processes first decreases with the increase in the aeration rate and then increases the cod of the effluent treated using as and ice processes is lowest at an aeration rate of 0 5 m3 h and reduced to 220 mg l and 237 mg l respectively whereas the cod of the effluent treated by the mbfb process is the lowest at an aeration rate of 0 6 m3 h and its value is reduced below 90 mg l which is much lower than the lowest cod of the effluent treated by as and ice processes this indicates that the mbfb process has higher organic removal efficiency for the treatment of coking wastewater this is mainly because the increase in aeration can not only enhance the redox reaction of ie 27 but can also accelerate microbial activity in addition aeration can provide a circulating driving power for the iron carbon filler and activated sludge in the reactor thereby enhancing the mass transfer and synergistic effect of micro electrolysis and biodegradation 2 however excess aeration not only make the contact iron and carbon easy to separate which is not conducive to the formation of the micro battery reaction between iron and ac 18 but also tends to cause aging of the microorganisms this is not conducive to the degradation of organic matter resulting in an increase in the cod concentration of the effluent the aeration rate has the same effect on nh4 n tn and cod removal the removal effect of nh4 n by the mbfb process is similar to that by the as process fig 3 b whereas the mbfb and ice processes have similar removal effects on no3 n at all aeration rates fig 3 d however only the mbfb process has a high removal effect on tn at all aeration rates fig 3 c when the aeration rate is 0 5 m3 h the mbfb process has a tn removal rate of 95 which is much higher than those of the ice process 46 and the as process 55 this confirms that the mbfb process can help synergistically degrade tn at all aeration rates 3 3 organic matter analyses with 3d ﬂuorescence spectra the organic matter before and after treating the coking wastewater using ice mbfb and as processes for 12 h was characterized by 3d fluorescence spectroscopy as shown in fig 4 according to chen et al the eem spectrum can be divided into regions i ii ii iv and v which are regarded as aromatic protein i aromatic protein ii fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humic acid like respectively 28 except for rayleigh and raman scattering the raw sewage shows some peaks in these five regions particularly when

raw coking wastewater as shown in fig 4 b although the fluorescence intensity of the organic matter in the coking wastewater treated using the ice process is significantly reduced owing to the effects

which exhibited cod and tn removal rates of 92 and 95 respectively the mbfb process could not only degrade protein like organics but also remove fulvic and humic like organics the oxidation and reduction functions in the mbfb process provide favorable conditions for aerobic and anaerobic degradation of microorganisms achieving a high tn removal rate and the fe2 and active hydrogen produced in the mbfb process could enrich acidovorax thereby promoting the reduction of nitrate therefore the mbfb process exhibited a strong synergistic effect and can be practically applied to the treatment of industrial wastewater with low c n ratios declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science

13817,in this study partial nitrification anammox process was established in two stage sequencing batch constructed wetlands sbcws to achieve autotrophic nitrogen removal for low strength ammonium wastewater treatment the operational parameters of the partial nitrification process were investigated and optimized for the subsequent anammox process the results indicated idle time and reaction time had significant influences to partial nitrification sbcw wpn in the wpn with optimal condition idle time 7 5 h reaction time 16 h the effluent nitrite to ammonium ratio no2 n nh4 n remained stable at 1 24 0 09 which favored the anammox process the anammox sbcw wamx was established rapidly within 61 d the two stage sbcws showed high efficient nitrogen removal capacity with effluent total nitrogen tn concentration of 3 89 0 62 mg l and tn removal rate of 81 11 2 92 moreover high throughput sequencing revealed that nitrosomonas 37 5 was dominant under optimal condition in wpn and responsible for partial nitrification process candidatus brocadia 26 5 was enriched in wamx undertaking anammox process with synergism of flanking bacteria this study provides a sustainable alternative for low strength wastewater treatment keywords sequencing batch constructed wetland low strength ammonium wastewater partial nitrification anammox microbial community 1 introduction excessive nitrogen input was the main reason of eutrophication in water environment in china the number of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps increased greatly with the urbanization acceleration 1 since nitrogen cannot be completely removed in wwtps the effluent total nitrogen tn is much higher than the background concentration in receiving water bodies excessive nitrogen would become a pollution source and cause eutrophication therefore there is an urgent need for high efficient nitrogen removal in some areas municipal wastewater had low carbon to nitrogen ratio and so the wwtps has insufficient carbon source for efficient nitrogen removal 2 traditional heterotrophic denitrification process consumed a great quantity of carbon source which is not a feasible method due to the high treatment cost and the management complexity compared with conventional nitrification and denitrification processes the partial nitrification and anammox process pn anammox has significant advantages such as higher nitrogen removal efficiency less oxygen demand lower sludge yield less n2o emission and no requirement of additional carbon source 3 4 therefore the pn anammox process could become a promising alternative for efficient autotrophic nitrogen removal at present the pn anammox process was mainly used for high strength ammonia wastewater such as aged landfill leachate 5 sludge digestion supernatant 6 industrial wastewater 7 and aquaculture wastewater 8 however it is hard to achieve pn anammox process for low strength ammonium wastewater such as municipal wastewater 30 60 mg l nh4 n achieving stable partial nitrification is the key constraint to realize pn anammox process in previous researches dissolved oxygen do was controlled to selectively inhibit the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob while maintaining the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 9 however a stable pn process is difficult to established for low strength ammonium wastewater treatment due to its low substrate concentration low oxygen demand and arduous do control 10 constructed wetlands cws is widely employed in the ecological treatment for low strength wastewater and advanced nutrients removal for secondary effluent 11 oxygen was provided through natural reoxygenation in cws thus the oxygen supply capacity is slighter than the artificial aeration making pn possible in cws in previous researches pn process was established in cws under tidal flow operation for medium strength ammonium wastewater with 50 mg l nh4 n 9 and 100 mg l nh4 n 12 respectively sequencing batch constructed wetlands sbcws has unique reoxygenation characteristics which make it a promising technique for pn process with low strength ammonium wastewater 13 as reoxygenation mainly occurs during the idle period in sbcws do can be controlled by manipulating the idle time and other parameters to facilitate pn process however the operating parameters to establish pn process in sbcws for low strength ammonium wastewater was still uncertain and little have been known about the stable nitrogen removal mechanism therefore research gap remains to be paid attention in previous studies anammox process could be established by inoculating anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob in airlift reactor and uasb reactor for wastewater of 30 mg l nh4 n 14 and 44 3 mg l nh4 n 15 respectively however it is not conducive to practical application since inoculating anaob was required which is difficult to enrich and to obtain in previous studies anammox activity was observed in a free surface cw and anaob was detected 16 and anammox process was achieved in biofilter for advanced wastewater treatment of low strength wastewater 17 although anammox process could be established for medium strength ammonium wastewater and the process can be achieved in cws there were few reports on the anammox process for low strength ammonium concentration 20 mg l wastewater treatment in cws to realize high efficient autotrophic nitrogen removal for low strength ammonium wastewater pn anammox process was established in two stage sbcws the objectives of this study were 1 to explored the optimal operational parameters of pn process in sbcw for the subsequent anammox process 2 to investigate the nitrogen removal performance of the coupling two stage sbcws 3 to analyze the microbial community by high throughput sequencing 4 and to verify the nitrogen removal pathways this study provides alternative of efficient autotrophic nitrogen removal 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental reactors five vertical subsurface flow sbcws were applied in this study hereinto four sbcws used to establish with partial nitrification process wpn throughout the entire experiment period and only one were established with anammox process wamx each sbcw was made from polyvinyl chlorid pvc column with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 130 cm the sbcws for partial nitrification wpn were planted with cattail typha latifolia and filled with gravel of different thickness and particle size table 1 in contrast the sbcw for anammox wamx was unplanted and filled with quartz sand with the particle size of 3 0 mm besides the wamx was covered with a plate to maintain in anaerobic environment the sbcws were placed in an air conditioned room and the temperature was 22 3 2 2 wastewater two kinds of synthetic wastewater wastewater ⅰ and wastewater ⅱ were prepared in this study for wpn and wamx respectively wpn was fed with wastewater ⅰ which mainly contained 20 mg l nh4 n and the components were 112 94 mg l nh4hco3 12 50 mg l cacl2 6 25 mg l kh2po4 6 25 mg l edta 12 50 mg l mgso4 and 6 25 mg l feso4 wamx was fed with wastewater ⅱ which mainly contained 8 50 mg l of nh4 n and 11 20 mg l of no2 n it was prepared by approximately 48 00 mg l nh4hco3 and 68 08 mg l kno2 the ph values in wastewater ⅰ and wastewater ⅱ were both maintained at 7 3 0 1 by adding 0 2 m hcl or naoh 2 3 experimental procedure the wpn and wamx were previously established and operated individually afterwards an optimal wpn and the only wamx were operated in series which became a two stage sbcws as shown in fig 1 2 3 1 wpn establishment each wpn was inoculated with dewatered activated sludge from a municipal wwtp in chongqing china the influence of four parameters of wpn were analyzed to investigated the optimal operational condition to establish partial nitrification process including filler particle size filler thickness idle time and reaction time therefore the experiments of wpn establishment were divided into four phases as illustrated in table 1 three sbcws wpn were operated in parallel during phase 1 and phase 2 while four sbcws wpn were operated in parallel during phase 3 and phase 4 the wpn were run in batch mode and the cycling time consisted of filling 0 25 h reaction variable draining 0 25 h and idle variable 2 3 2 wamx establishment the wamx was established synchronously with wpn dewatered activated sludge was also used as inoculum the wamx was packed with quartz sand the average particle size was 3 mm and the thickness was 80 cm the operation strategy was filling 0 25 h reaction 23 5 h draining 0 25 h idle 0 h 2 3 3 coupling of the two stage sbcws after wpn and wamx were established separately the optimal wpn and the only wamx were integrated into a coupling system to explore the nitrogen removal performance in two stage sbcws the optimal wpn was selected based on the performance during establishment see section 3 1 4 which had the filler thickness of 80 cm and average particle size of 2 5 mm while the optimal strategy was filling 0 25 h reaction 16 h draining 0 25 h idle 7 5 h therefore the wpn and the following wamx were coupled in series fig 1 wastewater i was pumped into wpn firstly for partial nitrification then the effluent of wpn flew into wamx for further anammox process 2 4 sampling and chemical analytical methods influent and effluent samples were collected from the sbcws every two days parameters such as nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn were analyzed by the standard methods 18 do concentration orp and ph values were monitored by a multi parameter detector hach hq30d usa the data were analyzed in origin software and the one way analysis of variance anova was applied with the significance level of 0 05 2 5 calculations the ammonium removal rate

filler 40 39 and 38 when particle size was 2 5 mm 7 5 mm and 12 5 mm s was the wetland area m2 t was the time d 2 6 microbial examination after 6 week operation of the two stage sbcws the biofilm samples were collected from wpn and wamx respectively noted as s1 and s2 the inoculum sludge was collected in the beginning of the experiment and cryopreserved at 20 c termed as s0 the procedures of genomic dna extracted and amplification were implemented as our previous study 11 briefly the genomic dna was extracted through three freeze thaw cycles and quantified spectrophotometrically the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the primers 338 f 5 act cct acg gga ggc agc ag 3 and 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 dna amplification was performed at 94 c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 c for 45 s 60 c for 45 s and 72 c for 90 s the amplification was verified in quantifluortm st system promega usa and sequenced by illumina platform the sequences were retrieved based on similarity and clustered into taxonomies by mothur program using silva databases https www arb silva de 3 results and discussion 3 1 partial nitrification performance in wpn 3 1 1 effect of filler particle size on partial nitrification in wpn the daily nitrogen removal performances of three wpn with different filler partial size were detailed in fig s1 the effluent nitrogen concentrations fluctuated during the start up period and gradually became stable no2 n accumulation appeared from the first day in the wpn with filler particle size of 2 5 mm while it appeared after 8th day in the other two wpn the filler particle size had a significant impact on the start up time of wpn the result indicated that the wpn with smaller filler particle size had a shorter start up period the effluent nitrogen concentrations of wpn in stable period were averaged and illustrated in fig 2 a with the filler particle size increased the effluent nh4 n concentrations of the wpn increased from 3 87 0 83 mg l to 13 46 0 68 mg l and the corresponding arlr decreased from 0 22 g n m2 h to 0 08 g n m2 h the results showed that the filler particle size had a significant effect on the partial nitrification in wpn p 0 001 since the filler porosity increased with the filler particle size decreased the filler particle size affected the hydrodynamic behavior in wpn which facilitated the oxygen mass flux and promoted the reoxygenation in idle time 19 in addition oxygen could be stored in the biofilm and adsorbed on the gravel surface of wpn 20 the smaller filler particle size resulted in a larger filler specific surface area the larger filler specific surface area provided more space for biofilm development which might increase the biomass amount of biofilm in wpn 21 22 thus smaller filler particle size increased the biomass in wpn and promoted the oxygen transfer which significantly enhanced the ammonia oxidation process however the filler particle size had no significant influence on the nar of wpn p 0 358 the nar of the three wpn ranged from 85 52 5 16 81 61 7 10 besides the naar of all three wpn was less than 20 suggesting that ammonia was mainly oxidized to nitrite instead of nitrate the results revealed that operational parameters of wpn could favor aob growth while nob might be inhibited in the wpn in previous study partial nitrification could be achieved by appropriate regulation many parameters to inhibit nob such as temperature ph free ammonia fa free nitrous acid fna do and chemical inhibitors 9 in this study do was considered as the principal factor to inhibit nob as the oxygen saturation constant of aob 0 2 1 5 mg l was lower than that of nob 1 2 1 5 mg l aob had the higher oxygen affinity compared with nob 23 the lower do concentration in wpn could inhibit nob the larger filler specific surface area could facilitate bacterial attachment and biofilm development which was beneficial to the enrichment of functional bacteria and promoted the establishment of the partial nitrification process 21 22 3 1 2 effect of filler thickness on partial nitrification in wpn with the filler thickness increased the effluent nh4 n concentrations of the wpn increased from 1 97 0 51 mg l to 5 73 0 47 mg l and the corresponding arlr also increased from 0 12 g n m2 h to and 0 29 g n m2 h fig 2b and fig s2 the results showed that filler thickness had a significant effect on the partial nitrification in wpn p 0 05 the filler thickness would influence the do concentration and redox status to impact the pollutants removal efficiency in cws 24 thus the arr increased significantly as filler thickness decreased similarly previous study found that wetland with thickness of 0 27 m had higher orp and arr compared with wetland with thickness of 0 5 m 19 however the filler thickness could not be excessively reduced if the thickness became smaller the actual treatment capacity would reduce and the arlr would also decrease the filler thickness had no obvious effect on the nar p 0 05 in this phase the filler particle size used in this experiment was 2 5 mm the no2 n accumulation appeared at the beginning of start up period in all wpn and then the nar rose to a stable level the effluent no3 n concentration was relative low which suggested that stable inhibition of nob was achieved the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratios of the three wpn in this phase were 8 54 2 40 3 94 1 34 2 20 0 20 respectively which could hardly meet the theoretical no2 n nh4 n ratio needed for anammox 1 32 similarly the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratios in phase 1 was not suitable as the influent for anammox process either it is necessary to adjust the operational strategy for the partial nitrification in wpn until its effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio is close to the theoretical value 1 32 3 1 3 effect of idle time tid on partial nitrification in wpn the nitrogen removal performances in wpn with different idle time tid during the start up period were detailed in fig s3 the effect of tid on partial nitrification performance in wpn was illustrated in fig 2c when the tid increased from 0 h to 3 5 h the arr increased from 27 37 2 76 48 76 2 75 the result demonstrated that the idle time could enhance the ammonia oxidation process in wpn the reason was that during the idle time the atmosphere entered into the filler bed which increased the oxygen transfer and maintained aerobic condition in wpn besides the alternating reaction and idle were beneficial to control the growth of the biofilm attached on the filler medium 25 when the tid further increased to 7 5 h the arr increased to 58 47 3 88 the idle time had a significant influence on the arr p 0 001 and the nar p 0 001 there were two reasons for the results above firstly with the extension of the tid the do concentration increased in wpn natural reoxygenation was enhanced which was beneficial for aob to oxidize nh4 n adsorbed on the gravel filler and more adsorption capacity of the filler was regenerated at the beginning of next cycle secondly part of the nh4 n adsorbed on the filler was oxidized to no2 n during idle and no2 n dissolved into liquid phase in the next cycle thus more ammonium was removed and the nitrite accumulation in wpn were promoted the average effluent no3 n concentration was low 1 mg l in wpn with tid of 0 h 7 5 h suggesting nob was inhibited nevertheless as tid further increased to 11 5 h the nar dropped sharply to 61 42 3 86 and the effluent no3 n concentration rose to 4 01 0 16 mg l fig 2c the results indicated that overlong tid would lead to excess reoxygenation capacity of wpn and accelerate the growth of nob thus the tid in wpn should be set appropriately idle time had a significant effect on effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio p 0 001 when tid was 7 5 h the maximum ratio was 1 24 0 09 indicating that the tid of 7 5 h was suitable for subsequent anammox process 3 1 4 effect of reaction time tre on partial nitrification in wpn the reaction time had significant effects on arr p 0 001 nar p 0 001 and effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio p 0 001 in fig 2d and fig s4 there was no obvious no3 n accumulation in wpn with various tre suggesting nob was inhibited in the wpn with t re of 16 h the arr and nar were the highest therefore the tid of 7 5 h and tre of 16 h were the optimal operational strategy for pn process in wpn the optimal wpn had the effluent nh4 n concentration of 8 31 0 78 mg l fig 2d and the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio was 1 24 0 09 to explore the stable partial nitrification performance under tre was 16 h the nitrogen variations along the 16 h reaction time were analyzed the ammonium oxidizing rate was 3 25 mg l h and 0 27 mg l h during 0 2 h and 2 16 h respectively fig 2e the results showed that the nitrification capacity was high within the first 2 h of the reaction time especially in the first 5 min of the reaction the arlr and ammonium oxidizing rate were 15 08 g m2 h and 54 72 mg l h respectively fig 2f however the do concentration decreased only from 7 8 0 38 mg l to 6 9 0 20 mg l fig 2f the result can be explained that the physicochemical adsorption rate of nh4 n was much higher than the biochemical oxidation rate at the beginning of the reaction to further confirm the adsorption capacity of gravel for nh4 n the adsorption test was conducted see supplementary data the result indicated that gravel had adsorption for nh4 n fig s5 which was consistent with previous research 26 therefore nh4 n was not only oxidized by aob but also adsorbed by the gravel in the reaction period which made nh4 n concentration decreased sharply with little no2 n generated therefore the arr and the nar were both higher in the initial 5 min of the reaction period while the concentration of do had no remarkably decrease fig 2f after 5 min the nh4 n removal rate slew down which might be due to the gradual saturation of adsorption at this time the do concentration was 6 9 0 20 mg l and the system was in the aerobic condition within 2 h of the reaction phase the do gradually decreased to about 1 mg l fig 2f and nitrite accumulation increased steadily the nh4 n removal was mainly due to microbial nitrification at the end of the reaction period the do was 0 19 mg l 0 42 mg l it was reported that low do concentration 1 mg l was able to ensure the enrichment of aob 27 in addition the system was in aerobic condition in the front stage and anoxic condition in the latter stage during the reaction time this aerobic anoxic alternating operation was beneficial to wash out nob since aob was more adaptable with the transient anoxic disturbance 28 29 moreover the overlong anoxic time 1 5 12 h not only slowed down the metabolism of nob but also initiated decay of nob 28 overall the results clearly demonstrated that idle and reaction time played significant roles in wpn by adjusting the idle time and reaction time a stable pn process could be realized in wpn 3 2 establishment of anammox process in wamx the establishment of wamx could be divided into three stages fig 3 a and fig 3b during the first 9 days the effluent tn concentration was higher than that in influent since nh4 n released from the inoculation sludge from day 10th to day 35th the effluent nh4 n concentration of wamx decreased from 15 53 mg l to 4 47 mg l with the gradual enrichment of anaob the effluent no2 n and no3 n concentration were low thus the removal rate of tn increased gradually to 77 32 on day 35th from day 36th to day 103th the nitrogen removal became stable the average effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 1 63 0 31 mg l 0 50 0 30 mg l and 1 49 0 34 mg l respectively and the average removal rate of tn was 82 12 2 70 during the stable stage the average ratio of no2 n removal to nh4 n removal no2 n nh4 n was 1 53 which was close to the theoretical value of 1 32 for anammox 30 suggesting obvious characteristics of anammox in the wamx however the no2 n nh4 n of 1 53 was higher than the theoretical value 1 32 while the no3 n nh4 n ratio of 0 13 was lower than the theoretical value 0 26 30 which might be a small amount of denitrifying bacteria in the wamx in wamx macromolecular organic compounds such as apoptotic bacteria and metabolites were degraded into small molecular degradable organic compounds which was supplied to denitrification 31 therefore a part of no3 n produced by anammox and a part of no2 n in the influent were denitrified after the establishment of anammox process in wamx the variation of nitrogen during an operational cycle was analyzed fig 3c during 0 h 14 h the average tn removal load per unit area was 0 35 g m2 h however the average removal load of tn was only 0 04 g m2 h during 14 h 24 h which was due to the low substrate concentration restricting the anaob activity in the latter period of the cycle the extremely slow growth rate of anaob and its doubling time was about 10 12 d 6 in general the establishing time of anammox process for low concentration nh4 n wastewater exceeds 100 days as reported in the literature 32 in this study the anammox process was successfully achieved in wamx within 61 days during the establishment the suitable ratio of no2 n nh4 n in influent was an important factor for the enrichment of anaob 33 besides the anaerobic condition in wamx the large specific surface area of quartz sand and the flanking bacteria with symbiotic interaction see section 3 4 were also beneficial to the enrichment and growth of anaob 3 3 coupling of wpn and wamx in two stage sbcws after the successful establishment the optimal wpn and the only wamx were operated in series as the two stage sbcws for low strength ammonium wastewater a part of the influent nh4 n was converted into no2 n through partial nitrification process in wpn then the wamx was responsible for anammox and autotrophic tn removal was achieved in fig 4 the concentration of tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the effluent of the two stage sbcws were 3 89 0 62 mg l 1 53 0 27 mg l 0 31 0 36 mg l and 2 04 0 39 mg l respectively the two stage sbcws achieved efficient and stable tn removal rate of 81 11 2 92 the results showed that the effluent of the optimal wpn with the appropriate operational parameters was beneficial to anammox in this study the effluent no2 n nh4 n of the optimal wpn could be stable at 1 24 0 09 which was the key factor to achieve anammox process in the wamx therefore the two stage sbcws can be well coupled showing high nitrogen removal capacity this study illustrated that the two stage sbcws with partial nitrification and anammox process could be established successfully and had efficient autotrophic nitrogen removal for low strength ammonium wastewater 3 4 microbial community 3 4 1 community diversity and richness in order to get a further insight into microorganisms in the two stage sbcws biomass samples obtained from the seed sludge s0 wpn s1 and wamx s2 were analyzed by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing as illustrated in table 2 operational taxonomic unit otu numbers among the samples of seed sludge wpn and wamx were 711 405 405 respectively based on 97 similarity the chao 1 and ace indices of s0 were higher than those of s1 and s2 the result indicated the community richness of seed sludge was the highest moreover the shannon and simpson indices illustrated that the community diversity of seed sludge was the highest the results showed that under the operating condition of two stage sbcws the microorganisms in the sbcws was domesticated directionally and the functional group were enriched leading to the community richness and population diversity decreased 3 4 2 microbial community structure in wpn phylum proteobacteria 66 3 bacteroidetes 20 4 chloroflexi 4 9 actinobacteria 1 8 and chlorobi 1 7 were dominant fig 5 a proteobacteria was a common dominant phylum in partial nitrification system some members of which identified as aob 34 35 its relative abundance increased significantly from 35 1 seed sludge to 66 3 wpn showing that the aob was enriched in wpn the phylum nitrospirae acting as nob 36 decreased from 2 4 seed sludge to 0 1 wpn the functional bacteria for nitrogen removal in wpn were analyzed in fig 5b the most predominant bacteria in the wpn was nitrosomonas 37 5 nitrosomonas was one of the dominant genera of aob which could oxidize ammonia to nitrite in wastewater treatment 37 comparing with the seed sludge the relative abundance of nitrosomonas increased from 0 2 37 5 it showed that the operating conditions in wpn were suitable for nitrosomonas which was the functional microbes to nitritation in the system while the relative abundance of nitrospira declined from 2 4 seed sludge to less than 0 1 wpn indicating the nob was inhibited in the wamx chloroflexi 33 6 planctomycetes 27 5 and proteobacteria 15 2 were the most abundant phyla fig 5a anammox bacteria was reported as a distinct phylogenetically deep branching group within the planctomycetes 38 the phylum chloroflexi was also found in a anammox system which could degrade the metabolites of anammox bacteria and the compounds of the dead biomass 37 therefore chloroflexi could provide a suitable environment for anaob previous study found that in an anammox reactor for synthetic wastewater without organic matter uncultured chloroflexi could give priority to the degradation of decaying anammox bacterial cells 39 in this study the abundance of chloroflexi and planctomycetes in wamx system increased significantly from 10 4 and 0 9 s0 to 33 6 and 27 5 s2 respectively which confirmed that chloroflexi was beneficial to the growth of anaob the dominant genera in wamx were norank anaerolineaceae 30 5 candidatus brocadia 26 5 norank fimbriimonadales 12 3 norank phds he36 4 5 and denitratisoma 4 3 respectively fig 5b the candidatus brocadia was one of the most dominant genera of anaob 40 and the most prevalent anammox functional bacteria in cws and soils 41 candidatus brocadia had higher tolerance to oxygen and relative higher growth rate than other anaob 42 which made it easier to enrich in wetlands in this study candidatus brocadia was detected as the dominant anaob in wamx contrasted with seed sludge s0 the abundance of candidatus brocadia in wamx s2 increased sharply from 0 1 26 5 fig 5b the results revealed that the functional anaob was enriched and efficient anammox process could be achieved in wamx after inoculated with dewatered activated sludge from municipal wwtp moreover norank anaerolineaceae which belonged to chloroflexi phylum increased from 2 2 s0 to 30 5 s2 fig 5b anaerolineaceae was found to be anaerobic bacteria which could decompose carbohydrates of anammox bacteria and other cellular tissues via fermentation 43 44 in this study anaerolineaceae depended on apoptosis and metabolite of bacteria and it played an important role to feedback the growth and metabolism of anaob thus anaerolineaceae formed symbiotic interaction with candidatus brocadia in addition denitratisoma belonging to proteobacteria phylum increased from 1 2 s0 to 4 3 s2 fig 5b which was common heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 45 previous research also found denitratisoma existed in an anammox uasb reactor for synthetic wastewater without external carbon source and accounted for high relative abundance 22 1 23 6 46 it was speculated that the carbon source required for denitrification process was the internal carbon source produced by bacterial lysis and decay as mentioned above phylum chloroflexi could decompose soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymers eps and degrade complex compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins into small molecular carbon sources for denitratisoma bacteria then denitratisoma was able to consume dissolved carbon sources and establish a suitable microenvironment for the anammox system 47 furthermore in this study the accumulation of nitrate in wamx was 0 13 which was less than the theoretical value 0 26 of anammox process 30 confirming that denitrification existed in wamx 3 5 feasibility and implication in this study the two stage sbcws based on pn anammox process was developed for low strength ammonium wastewater the process is an autotrophic nitrogen removal technology which has potential application for the treatment of low carbon source municipal wastewater and non point source pollution of rainfall runoff efficient nitrogen removal was able to achieve without extra carbon source addition therefore external carbon source was retrenched and additional energy consumption was avoided the technology could improve wastewater treatment capacity and further ameliorate the water pollution 4 conclusion in this study high efficient pn anammox process was achieved in a two stage sbcws tn removal rate was 81 11 2 92 the tid and tre were crucial parameters to achieve pn process in wpn when wpn was under optimal condition tid 7 5 h tre 16 h the effluent no2 n nh4 n was 1 24 0 09 the stable operation of wpn could guarantee the subsequent anammox process in wamx the dominant aob was nitrosomonas 37 5 in wpn and the dominant anaob was candidatus brocadia 26 5 in wamx respectively denitrifying bacteria denitratisoma enhanced the nitrogen removal in wamx the two stage sbcws provides an efficient and sustainable autotrophic

time had significant influences to partial nitrification sbcw wpn in the wpn with optimal condition idle time 7 5 h reaction time 16 h the effluent nitrite to ammonium ratio no2 n nh4 n remained stable at 1 24 0 09 which favored the anammox process the anammox sbcw wamx was established rapidly within 61 d the two stage sbcws showed high efficient nitrogen removal capacity with effluent total nitrogen tn concentration of 3 89 0 62 mg l and tn removal rate of 81 11 2 92 moreover high throughput sequencing revealed that nitrosomonas 37 5 was dominant under optimal condition in wpn and responsible for partial nitrification process candidatus brocadia 26 5 was enriched in wamx undertaking anammox process with synergism of flanking bacteria this study provides a sustainable alternative for low strength wastewater treatment keywords sequencing batch constructed wetland low strength ammonium wastewater partial nitrification anammox microbial community 1 introduction excessive nitrogen input was the main reason of eutrophication in water environment in china the number of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps increased greatly with the urbanization acceleration 1 since nitrogen cannot be completely removed in wwtps the effluent total nitrogen tn is much higher than the background concentration in receiving water bodies excessive nitrogen would become a pollution source and cause eutrophication therefore there is an urgent need for high efficient nitrogen removal in some areas municipal wastewater had low carbon to nitrogen ratio and so the wwtps has insufficient carbon source for efficient nitrogen removal 2 traditional heterotrophic denitrification process consumed a great quantity of carbon source which is not a feasible method due to the high treatment cost and the management complexity compared with conventional nitrification and denitrification processes the partial nitrification and anammox process pn anammox has significant advantages such as higher nitrogen removal efficiency less oxygen demand lower sludge yield less n2o emission and no requirement of additional carbon source 3 4 therefore the pn anammox process could become a promising alternative for efficient autotrophic nitrogen removal at present the pn anammox process was mainly used for high strength ammonia wastewater such as aged landfill leachate 5 sludge digestion supernatant 6 industrial wastewater 7 and aquaculture wastewater 8 however it is hard to achieve pn anammox process for low strength ammonium wastewater such as municipal wastewater 30 60 mg l nh4 n achieving stable partial nitrification is the key constraint to realize pn anammox process in previous researches dissolved oxygen do was controlled to selectively inhibit the activity of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob while maintaining the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 9 however a stable pn process is difficult to established for low strength ammonium wastewater treatment due to its low substrate concentration low oxygen demand and arduous do control 10 constructed wetlands cws is widely employed in the ecological treatment for low strength wastewater and advanced nutrients removal for secondary effluent 11 oxygen was provided through natural reoxygenation in cws thus the oxygen supply capacity is slighter than the artificial aeration making pn possible in cws in previous researches pn process was established in cws under tidal flow operation for medium strength ammonium wastewater with 50 mg l nh4 n 9 and 100 mg l nh4 n 12 respectively sequencing batch constructed wetlands sbcws has unique reoxygenation characteristics which make it a promising technique for pn process with low strength ammonium wastewater 13 as reoxygenation mainly occurs during the idle period in sbcws do can be controlled by manipulating the idle time and other parameters to facilitate pn process however the operating parameters to establish pn process in sbcws for low strength ammonium wastewater was still uncertain and little have been known about the stable nitrogen removal mechanism therefore research gap remains to be paid attention in previous studies anammox process could be established by inoculating anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob in airlift reactor and uasb reactor for wastewater of 30 mg l nh4 n 14 and 44 3 mg l nh4 n 15 respectively however it is not conducive to practical application since inoculating anaob was required which is difficult to enrich and to obtain in previous studies anammox activity was observed in a free surface cw and anaob was detected 16 and anammox process was achieved in biofilter for advanced wastewater treatment of low strength wastewater 17 although anammox process could be established for medium strength ammonium wastewater and the process can be achieved in cws there were few reports on the anammox process for low strength ammonium concentration 20 mg l wastewater treatment in cws to realize high efficient autotrophic nitrogen removal for low strength ammonium wastewater pn anammox process was established in two stage sbcws the objectives of this study were 1 to explored the optimal operational parameters of pn process in sbcw for the subsequent anammox process 2 to investigate the nitrogen removal performance of the coupling two stage sbcws 3 to analyze the microbial community by high throughput sequencing 4 and to verify the nitrogen removal pathways this study provides alternative of efficient autotrophic nitrogen removal 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental reactors five vertical subsurface flow sbcws were applied in this study hereinto four sbcws used to establish with partial nitrification process wpn throughout the entire experiment period and only one were established with anammox process wamx each sbcw was made from polyvinyl chlorid pvc column with a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 130 cm the sbcws for partial nitrification wpn were planted with cattail typha latifolia and filled with gravel of different thickness and particle size table 1 in contrast the sbcw for anammox wamx was unplanted and filled with quartz sand with the particle size of 3 0 mm besides the wamx was covered with a plate to maintain in anaerobic environment the sbcws were placed in an air conditioned room and the temperature was 22 3 2 2 wastewater two kinds of synthetic wastewater wastewater ⅰ and wastewater ⅱ were prepared in this study for wpn and wamx respectively wpn was fed with wastewater ⅰ which mainly contained 20 mg l nh4 n and the components were 112 94 mg l nh4hco3 12 50 mg l cacl2 6 25 mg l kh2po4 6 25 mg l edta 12 50 mg l mgso4 and 6 25 mg l feso4 wamx was fed with wastewater ⅱ which mainly contained 8 50 mg l of nh4 n and 11 20 mg l of no2 n it was prepared by approximately 48 00 mg l nh4hco3 and 68 08 mg l kno2 the ph values in wastewater ⅰ and wastewater ⅱ were both maintained at 7 3 0 1 by adding 0 2 m hcl or naoh 2 3 experimental procedure the wpn and wamx were previously established and operated individually afterwards an optimal wpn and the only wamx were operated in series which became a two stage sbcws as shown in fig 1 2 3 1 wpn establishment each wpn was inoculated with dewatered activated sludge from a municipal wwtp in chongqing china the influence of four parameters of wpn were analyzed to investigated the optimal operational condition to establish partial nitrification process including filler particle size filler thickness idle time and reaction time therefore the experiments of wpn establishment were divided into four phases as illustrated in table 1 three sbcws wpn were operated in parallel during phase 1 and phase 2 while four sbcws wpn were operated in parallel during phase 3 and phase 4 the wpn were run in batch mode and the cycling time consisted of filling 0 25 h reaction variable draining 0 25 h and idle variable 2 3 2 wamx establishment the wamx was established synchronously with wpn dewatered activated sludge was also used as inoculum the wamx was packed with quartz sand the average particle size was 3 mm and the thickness was 80 cm the operation strategy was filling 0 25 h reaction 23 5 h draining 0 25 h idle 0 h 2 3 3 coupling of the two stage sbcws after wpn and wamx were established separately the optimal wpn and the only wamx were integrated into a coupling system to explore the nitrogen removal performance in two stage sbcws the optimal wpn was selected based on the performance during establishment see section 3 1 4 which had the filler thickness of 80 cm and average particle size of 2 5 mm while the optimal strategy was filling 0 25 h reaction 16 h draining 0 25 h idle 7 5 h therefore the wpn and the following wamx were coupled in series fig 1 wastewater i was pumped into wpn firstly for partial nitrification then the effluent of wpn flew into wamx for further anammox process 2 4 sampling and chemical analytical methods influent and effluent samples were collected from the sbcws every two days parameters such as nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn were analyzed by the standard methods 18 do concentration orp and ph values were monitored by a multi parameter detector hach hq30d usa the data were analyzed in origin software and the one way analysis of variance anova was applied with the significance level of 0 05 2 5 calculations the ammonium removal rate arr nitrite accumulating rate nar nitrate accumulating rate naar and ammonium removal loading rate per unit wetland area arlr were calculated using the equations as follow 1 arr n h 4 n i n f n h 4 n

ninf nh4 neff no2 neff and no3 neff represented the influent and effluent nitrogen concentration mg l nh4 n was the nh4 n removal amount mg l v was the wetland volume m3 p was the porosity of the filler 40 39 and 38 when particle size was 2 5 mm 7 5 mm and 12 5 mm s was the wetland area m2 t was the time d 2 6 microbial examination after 6 week operation of the two stage sbcws the biofilm samples were collected from wpn and wamx respectively noted as s1 and s2 the inoculum sludge was collected in the beginning of the experiment and cryopreserved at 20 c termed as s0 the procedures of genomic dna extracted and amplification were implemented as our previous study 11 briefly the genomic dna was extracted through three freeze thaw cycles and quantified spectrophotometrically the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the primers 338 f 5 act cct acg gga ggc agc ag 3 and 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 dna amplification was performed at 94 c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 c for 45 s 60 c for 45 s and 72 c for 90 s the amplification was verified in quantifluortm st system promega usa and sequenced by illumina platform the sequences were retrieved based on similarity and clustered into taxonomies by mothur program using silva databases https www arb silva de 3 results and discussion 3 1 partial nitrification performance in wpn 3 1 1 effect of filler particle size on partial nitrification in wpn the daily nitrogen removal performances of three wpn with different filler partial size were detailed in fig s1 the effluent nitrogen concentrations fluctuated during the start up period and gradually became stable no2 n accumulation appeared from the first day in the wpn with filler particle size of 2 5 mm while it appeared after 8th day in the other two wpn the filler particle size had a significant impact on the start up time of wpn the result indicated that the wpn with smaller filler particle size had a shorter start up period the effluent nitrogen concentrations of wpn in stable period were averaged and illustrated in fig 2 a with the filler particle size increased the effluent nh4 n concentrations of the wpn increased from 3 87 0 83 mg l to 13 46 0 68 mg l and the corresponding arlr decreased from 0 22 g n m2 h to 0 08 g n m2 h the results showed that the filler particle size had a significant effect on the partial nitrification in wpn p 0 001 since the filler porosity increased with the filler particle size decreased the filler particle size affected the hydrodynamic behavior in wpn which facilitated the oxygen mass flux and promoted the reoxygenation in idle time 19 in addition oxygen could be stored in the biofilm and adsorbed on the gravel surface of wpn 20 the smaller filler particle size resulted in a larger filler specific surface area the larger filler specific surface area provided more space for biofilm development which might increase the biomass amount of biofilm in wpn 21 22 thus smaller filler particle size increased the biomass in wpn and promoted the oxygen transfer which significantly enhanced the ammonia oxidation process however the filler particle size had no significant influence on the nar of wpn p 0 358 the nar of the three wpn ranged from 85 52 5 16 81 61 7 10 besides the naar of all three wpn was less than 20 suggesting that ammonia was mainly oxidized to nitrite instead of nitrate the results revealed that operational parameters of wpn could favor aob growth while nob might be inhibited in the wpn in previous study partial nitrification could be achieved by appropriate regulation many parameters to inhibit nob such as temperature ph free ammonia fa free nitrous acid fna do and chemical inhibitors 9 in this study do was considered as the principal factor to inhibit nob as the oxygen saturation constant of aob 0 2 1 5 mg l was lower than that of nob 1 2 1 5 mg l aob had the higher oxygen affinity compared with nob 23 the lower do concentration in wpn could inhibit nob the larger filler specific surface area could facilitate bacterial attachment and biofilm development which was beneficial to the enrichment of functional bacteria and promoted the establishment of the partial nitrification process 21 22 3 1 2 effect of filler thickness on partial nitrification in wpn with the filler thickness increased the effluent nh4 n concentrations of the wpn increased from 1 97 0 51 mg l to 5 73 0 47 mg l and the corresponding arlr also increased from 0 12 g n m2 h to and 0 29 g n m2 h fig 2b and fig s2 the results showed that filler thickness had a significant effect on the partial nitrification in wpn p 0 05 the filler thickness would influence the do concentration and redox status to impact the pollutants removal efficiency in cws 24 thus the arr increased significantly as filler thickness decreased similarly previous study found that wetland with thickness of 0 27 m had higher orp and arr compared with wetland with thickness of 0 5 m 19 however the filler thickness could not be excessively reduced if the thickness became smaller the actual treatment capacity would reduce and the arlr would also decrease the filler thickness had no obvious effect on the nar p 0 05 in this phase the filler particle size used in this experiment was 2 5 mm the no2 n accumulation appeared at the beginning of start up period in all wpn and then the nar rose to a stable level the effluent no3 n concentration was relative low which suggested that stable inhibition of nob was achieved the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratios of the three wpn in this phase were 8 54 2 40 3 94 1 34 2 20 0 20 respectively which could hardly meet the theoretical no2 n nh4 n ratio needed for anammox 1 32 similarly the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratios in phase 1 was not suitable as the influent for anammox process either it is necessary to adjust the operational strategy for the partial nitrification in wpn until its effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio is close to the theoretical value 1 32 3 1 3 effect of idle time tid on partial nitrification in wpn the nitrogen removal performances in wpn with different idle time tid during the start up period were detailed in fig s3 the effect of tid on partial nitrification performance in wpn was illustrated in fig 2c when the tid increased from 0 h to 3 5 h the arr increased from 27 37 2 76 48 76 2 75 the result demonstrated that the idle time could enhance the ammonia oxidation process in wpn the reason was that during the idle time the atmosphere entered into the filler bed which increased the oxygen transfer and maintained aerobic condition in wpn besides the alternating reaction and idle were beneficial to control the growth of the biofilm attached on the filler medium 25 when the tid further increased to 7 5 h the arr increased to 58 47 3 88 the idle time had a significant influence on the arr p 0 001 and the nar p 0 001 there were two reasons for the results above firstly with the extension of the tid the do concentration increased in wpn natural reoxygenation was enhanced which was beneficial for aob to oxidize nh4 n adsorbed on the gravel filler and more adsorption capacity of the filler was regenerated at the beginning of next cycle secondly part of the nh4 n adsorbed on the filler was oxidized to no2 n during idle and no2 n dissolved into liquid phase in the next cycle thus more ammonium was removed and the nitrite accumulation in wpn were promoted the average effluent no3 n concentration was low 1 mg l in wpn with tid of 0 h 7 5 h suggesting nob was inhibited nevertheless as tid further increased to 11 5 h the nar dropped sharply to 61 42 3 86 and the effluent no3 n concentration rose to 4 01 0 16 mg l fig 2c the results indicated that overlong tid would lead to excess reoxygenation capacity of wpn and accelerate the growth of nob thus the tid in wpn should be set appropriately idle time had a significant effect on effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio p 0 001 when tid was 7 5 h the maximum ratio was 1 24 0 09 indicating that the tid of 7 5 h was suitable for subsequent anammox process 3 1 4 effect of reaction time tre on partial nitrification in wpn the reaction time had significant effects on arr p 0 001 nar p 0 001 and effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio p 0 001 in fig 2d and fig s4 there was no obvious no3 n accumulation in wpn with various tre suggesting nob was inhibited in the wpn with t re of 16 h the arr and nar were the highest therefore the tid of 7 5 h and tre of 16 h were the optimal operational strategy for pn process in wpn the optimal wpn had the effluent nh4 n concentration of 8 31 0 78 mg l fig 2d and the effluent no2 n nh4 n ratio was 1 24 0 09 to explore the stable partial nitrification performance under tre was 16 h the nitrogen variations along the 16 h reaction time were analyzed the ammonium oxidizing rate was 3 25 mg l h and 0 27 mg l h during 0 2 h and 2 16 h respectively fig 2e the results showed that the nitrification capacity was high within the first 2 h of the reaction time especially in the first 5 min of the reaction the arlr and ammonium oxidizing rate were 15 08 g m2 h and 54 72 mg l h respectively fig 2f however the do concentration decreased only from 7 8 0 38 mg l to 6 9 0 20 mg l fig 2f the result can be explained that the physicochemical adsorption rate of nh4 n was much higher than the biochemical oxidation rate at the beginning of the reaction to further confirm the adsorption capacity of gravel for nh4 n the adsorption test was conducted see supplementary data the result indicated that gravel had adsorption for nh4 n fig s5 which was consistent with previous research 26 therefore nh4 n was not only oxidized by aob but also adsorbed by the gravel in the reaction period which made nh4 n concentration decreased sharply with little no2 n generated therefore the arr and the nar were both higher in the initial 5 min of the reaction period while the concentration of do had no remarkably decrease fig 2f after 5 min the nh4 n removal rate slew down which might be due to the gradual saturation of adsorption at this time the do concentration was 6 9 0 20 mg l and the system was in the aerobic condition within 2 h of the reaction phase the do gradually decreased to about 1 mg l fig 2f and nitrite accumulation increased steadily the nh4 n removal was mainly due to microbial nitrification at the end of the reaction period the do was 0 19 mg l 0 42 mg l it was reported that low do concentration 1 mg l was able to ensure the enrichment of aob 27 in addition the system was in aerobic condition in the front stage and anoxic condition in the latter stage during the reaction time this aerobic anoxic alternating operation was beneficial to wash out nob since aob was more adaptable with the transient anoxic disturbance 28 29 moreover the overlong anoxic time 1 5 12 h not only slowed down the metabolism of nob but also initiated decay of nob 28 overall the results clearly demonstrated that idle and reaction time played significant roles in wpn by adjusting the idle time and reaction time a stable pn process could be realized in wpn 3 2 establishment of anammox process in wamx the establishment of wamx could be divided into three stages fig 3 a and fig 3b during the first 9 days the effluent tn concentration was higher than that in influent since nh4 n released from the inoculation sludge from day 10th to day 35th the effluent nh4 n concentration of wamx decreased from 15 53 mg l to 4 47 mg l with the gradual enrichment of anaob the effluent no2 n and no3 n concentration were low thus the removal rate of tn increased gradually to 77 32 on day 35th from day 36th to day 103th the nitrogen removal became stable the average effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were 1 63 0 31 mg l 0 50 0 30 mg l and 1 49 0 34 mg l respectively and the average removal rate of tn was 82 12 2 70 during the stable stage the average ratio of no2 n removal to nh4 n removal no2 n nh4 n was 1 53 which was close to the theoretical value of 1 32 for anammox 30 suggesting obvious characteristics of anammox in the wamx however the no2 n nh4 n of 1 53 was higher than the theoretical value 1 32 while the no3 n nh4 n ratio of 0 13 was lower than the theoretical value 0 26 30 which might be a small amount of denitrifying bacteria in the wamx in wamx macromolecular organic compounds such as apoptotic bacteria and metabolites were degraded into small molecular degradable organic compounds which was supplied to denitrification 31 therefore a part of no3 n produced by anammox and a part of no2 n in the influent were denitrified after the establishment of anammox process in wamx the variation of nitrogen during an operational cycle was analyzed fig 3c during 0 h 14 h the average tn removal load per unit area was 0 35 g m2 h however the average removal load of tn was only 0 04 g m2 h during 14 h 24 h which was due to the low substrate concentration restricting the anaob activity in the latter period of the cycle the extremely slow growth rate of anaob and its doubling time was about 10 12 d 6 in general the establishing time of anammox process for low concentration nh4 n wastewater exceeds 100 days as reported in the literature 32 in this study the anammox process was successfully achieved in wamx within 61 days during the establishment the suitable ratio of no2 n nh4 n in influent was an important factor for the enrichment of anaob 33 besides the anaerobic condition in wamx the large specific surface area of quartz sand and the flanking bacteria with symbiotic interaction see section 3 4 were also beneficial to the enrichment and growth of anaob 3 3 coupling of wpn and wamx in two stage sbcws after the successful establishment the optimal wpn and the only wamx were operated in series as the two stage sbcws for low strength ammonium wastewater a part of the influent nh4 n was converted into no2 n through partial nitrification process in wpn then the wamx was responsible for anammox and autotrophic tn removal was achieved in fig 4 the concentration of tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the effluent of the two stage sbcws were 3 89 0 62 mg l 1 53 0 27 mg l 0 31 0 36 mg l and 2 04 0 39 mg l respectively the two stage sbcws achieved efficient and stable tn removal rate of 81 11 2 92 the results showed that the effluent of the optimal wpn with the appropriate operational parameters was beneficial to anammox in this study the effluent no2 n nh4 n of the optimal wpn could be stable at 1 24 0 09 which was the key factor to achieve anammox process in the wamx therefore the two stage sbcws can be well coupled showing high nitrogen removal capacity this study illustrated that the two stage sbcws with partial nitrification and anammox process could be established successfully and had efficient autotrophic nitrogen removal for low strength ammonium wastewater 3 4 microbial community 3 4 1 community diversity and richness in order to get a further insight into microorganisms in the two stage sbcws biomass samples obtained from the seed sludge s0 wpn s1 and wamx s2 were analyzed by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing as illustrated in table 2 operational taxonomic unit otu numbers among the samples of seed sludge wpn and wamx were 711 405 405 respectively based on 97 similarity the chao 1 and ace indices of s0 were higher than those of s1 and s2 the result indicated the community richness of seed sludge was the highest moreover the shannon and simpson indices illustrated that the community diversity of seed sludge was the highest the results showed that under the operating condition of two stage sbcws the microorganisms in the sbcws was domesticated directionally and the functional group were enriched leading to the community richness and population diversity decreased 3 4 2 microbial community structure in wpn phylum proteobacteria 66 3 bacteroidetes 20 4 chloroflexi 4 9 actinobacteria 1 8 and chlorobi 1 7 were dominant fig 5 a proteobacteria was a common dominant phylum in partial nitrification system some members of which identified as aob 34 35 its relative abundance increased significantly from 35 1 seed sludge to 66 3 wpn showing that the aob was enriched in wpn the phylum nitrospirae acting as nob 36 decreased from 2 4 seed sludge to 0 1 wpn the functional bacteria for nitrogen removal in wpn were analyzed in fig 5b the most predominant bacteria in the wpn was nitrosomonas 37 5 nitrosomonas was one of the dominant genera of aob which could oxidize ammonia to nitrite in wastewater treatment 37 comparing with the seed sludge the relative abundance of nitrosomonas increased from 0 2 37 5 it showed that the operating conditions in wpn were suitable for nitrosomonas which was the functional microbes to nitritation in the system while the relative abundance of nitrospira declined from 2 4 seed sludge to less than 0 1 wpn indicating the nob was inhibited in the wamx chloroflexi 33 6 planctomycetes 27 5 and proteobacteria 15 2 were the most abundant phyla fig 5a anammox bacteria was reported as a distinct phylogenetically deep branching group within the planctomycetes 38 the phylum chloroflexi was also found in a anammox system which could degrade the metabolites of anammox bacteria and the compounds of the dead biomass 37 therefore chloroflexi could provide a suitable environment for anaob previous study found that in an anammox reactor for synthetic wastewater without organic matter uncultured chloroflexi could give priority to the degradation of decaying anammox bacterial cells 39 in this study the abundance of chloroflexi and planctomycetes in wamx system increased significantly from 10 4 and 0 9 s0 to 33 6 and 27 5 s2 respectively which confirmed that chloroflexi was beneficial to the growth of anaob the dominant genera in wamx were norank anaerolineaceae 30 5 candidatus brocadia 26 5 norank fimbriimonadales 12 3 norank phds he36 4 5 and denitratisoma 4 3 respectively fig 5b the candidatus brocadia was one of the most dominant genera of anaob 40 and the most prevalent anammox functional bacteria in cws and soils 41 candidatus brocadia had higher tolerance to oxygen and relative higher growth rate than other anaob 42 which made it easier to enrich in wetlands in this study candidatus brocadia was detected as the dominant anaob in wamx contrasted with seed sludge s0 the abundance of candidatus brocadia in wamx s2 increased sharply from 0 1 26 5 fig 5b the results revealed that the functional anaob was enriched and efficient anammox process could be achieved in wamx after inoculated with dewatered activated sludge from municipal wwtp moreover norank anaerolineaceae which belonged to chloroflexi phylum increased from 2 2 s0 to 30 5 s2 fig 5b anaerolineaceae was found to be anaerobic bacteria which could decompose carbohydrates of anammox bacteria and other cellular tissues via fermentation 43 44 in this study anaerolineaceae depended on apoptosis and metabolite of bacteria and it played an important role to feedback the growth and metabolism of anaob thus anaerolineaceae formed symbiotic interaction with candidatus brocadia in addition denitratisoma belonging to proteobacteria phylum increased from 1 2 s0 to 4 3 s2 fig 5b which was common heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 45 previous research also found denitratisoma existed in an anammox uasb reactor for synthetic wastewater without external carbon source and accounted for high relative abundance 22 1 23 6 46 it was speculated that the carbon source required for denitrification process was the internal carbon source produced by bacterial lysis and decay as mentioned above phylum chloroflexi could decompose soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymers eps and degrade complex compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins into small molecular carbon sources for denitratisoma bacteria then denitratisoma was able to consume dissolved carbon sources and establish a suitable microenvironment for the anammox system 47 furthermore in this study the accumulation of nitrate in wamx was 0 13 which was less than the theoretical value 0 26 of anammox process 30 confirming that denitrification existed in wamx 3 5 feasibility and implication in this study the two stage sbcws based on pn anammox process was developed for low strength ammonium wastewater the process is an autotrophic nitrogen removal technology which has potential application for the treatment of low carbon source municipal wastewater and non point source pollution of rainfall runoff efficient nitrogen removal was able to achieve without extra carbon source addition therefore external carbon source was retrenched and additional energy consumption was avoided the technology could improve wastewater treatment capacity and further ameliorate the water pollution 4 conclusion in this study high efficient pn anammox process was achieved in a two stage sbcws tn removal rate was 81 11 2 92 the tid and tre were crucial parameters to achieve pn process in wpn when wpn was under optimal condition tid 7 5 h tre 16 h the effluent no2 n nh4 n was 1 24 0 09 the stable operation of wpn could guarantee the subsequent anammox process in wamx the dominant aob was nitrosomonas 37 5 in wpn and the dominant anaob was candidatus brocadia 26 5 in wamx respectively denitrifying bacteria denitratisoma enhanced the nitrogen removal in wamx the two stage sbcws provides an efficient and sustainable autotrophic

13818,3 4 dimethyl aniline is a stubborn organic matter and widely appears in many industrial wastewaters a novel method hybrid photo electrocatalytic oxidation hpeco combining photocatalytic oxidation pco with electrocatalytic oxidation eco was established to treat it the removal efficiencies were compared among hpeco pco and eco systems and the result suggested hpeco was 2 45 and 1 14 times higher than the sum of other two systems for 3 4 dma and toc removals separately furthermore a three stage mechanism was proposed in hpeco process by cyclic voltammetry esr and quantitative determination of hclo and a whole degradation pathway was deduced by gc ms in the first stages hclo attacked the side chains of 3 4 dma and oxidized it into 3 4 dimethylphenol 2 amino 6 methylbenzoic acid and 1 2 4 benzoic acid in the last two stages these intermediates were further degraded until mineralization under the co oxidation of chlorine radical species crs and oh in addition synergistic effect was studied with generating reason and controlling factors uv irradiation and applied voltage could increase the yields of oh and crs electrochemical process could also accelerate the production of oh through o2 evolution reaction the existence of oh could facilitate the transform of 3 4 dma into the intermediates containing cooh groups which provided the bridge substances for crs and hclo to achieve the rapid selective oxidation the further investigation found that synergistic effect was positively correlated with current density and negative correlated with ph and uv power finally pharmaceutical wastewater was treated with this novel method and it can be successfully removed to meet the chinese national sewage discharge standard after 30 h degradation keywords hybrid photo electrocatalytic oxidation hpeco 3 4 dimethyaniline oxidation mechanism synergistic mechanism synergistic contribution 1 introduction 3 4 dimethyl aniline 3 4 dma is an important fine chemical intermediate to synthesize riboflavin vitamin b2 and it can be widely used in pesticides antioxidants pharmaceuticals and personal care products 1 2 it has the ability to cause cancer and damage dna in biological cells 3 4 3 4 dma wastewater is always accompanied with a detrimental concentration of cl especially in industrial production 5 in a hand aniline compounds are environmentally persistent and hard to be oxidized by traditional biodegradation processes due to their biotoxicity 6 7 in the other hand cl reduces biodegradability and increases the treatment difficulties for organic wastewater 8 so it is urgent to discover a new method to solve these problems the focus of the current study is on the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic processes 9 12 photocatalytic oxidation pco is dependent on the direct degradation by oh oh could oxidize most of objective organic substances and intermediates during degradation due to its strong oxidizing property the complete and environment friendly degradation would be therefore achieved in the treatment of organic wastewater however the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes reduces the production of oh and it becomes a major barrier to efficient degradation for pco 13 14 in order to reduce recombination and improve degradation efficiency more and more newly composite catalysts were researched and developed such as v2o5 tio2 rgo tio2 wo3 tio2 and c n co doped tio2 for its better removal performance at high conductivity electrocatalytic oxidation eco becomes a popular method for the wastewater with high salinity 15 recently many coated electrodes were under investigation for a higher efficiency such as ti iro2 ti pbo2 ti sno2 ti ruo2 and bdd ti iro2 is considered as an active anode material in which could produce free chlorines including cl2 hclo and clo in the presence of cl 16 however many toxic intermediates would remain in the effluent and even enter into environment to bring secondary pollution through electrochemical process 17 the combination of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis would solve these problems efficiently compared to individual eco and pco so the combined process hybrid photo electrocatalytic oxidation was established in combined system ti iro2 anode would oxidize cl into free chlorine in the solution and then free chlorine could be decomposed into oh and cl under uv irradiation this reaction was coincident to the photo assisted electrocatalytic oxidation peo as previous studies 18 20 unlike the previous study of peo the dispersed tio2 was added into hpeco system this would allow o2 to be the bridge substance for co operation degradation in a hand o2 would be produced greatly through the oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalytic subsystem 21 in another hand it could also be the recipient for photo generated electrons to improve the production of photo generated oh in photocatalytic subsystem 22 23 furthermore the applied voltage could accelerate the separation of photo generated carriers for dispersed tio2 which would increase the yield of photo generated oh under the co operation of these species a synergistic effect may be occurred and more efficient degradation would be obtained in hpeco as far as the authors are aware there are many studies about individual electrocatalytic and photocatalytic treatments of aniline organics and there are fewer studies about the combined degradation between them in this study combined process hpeco was investigated with the comparison of other two treatments and the combined degradation pathway and mechanism were further studied interestingly this paper proved the existence of the synergistic effect between pco and eco this paper was mainly intended to figure out the causes and controlling factors for synergistic effect in order to enhance this effect and improve degradation efficiency however the recycle and reuse of tio2 catalyst may hinder the widespread use of hpeco in the industrial production this problem should be explored for next investigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents 3 4 dma sodium sulfate sodium chloride tertiary butanol nitrobenzene hydrochloric sodium hydroxide dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide and dmso dimethylsulfoxide were purchased in sinopharm group chemical reagent co ltd these chemicals were of analytic grade without further purification titanium dioxide p25 degussa were purchased in heqian group guangzhou co ltd 2 2 experiment devices the reaction was performed in a cuboid electrochemical box fig 1 made of organic glass with the size of 16 0 12 0 12 0 cm and the effective volume of 1 0 l the reactor was covered with silver paper in order to avoid the sunshine a thermostatic magnetic heating stirrer was at the bottom of reactor and 300 r min stirring was set in all experiments the anode was iridium dioxide on titanium and the cathode was graphite a laboratory direct current power supply 30 0 v 5 00 a zhaoxin group in shenzhen co ltd china was used to provide a current density of 70 ma cm2 for electrochemical experiments ultraviolet light power of 12 w and wavelength at 253 7 nm set in a quarz tube was submerged in the reactor for the photodegradation studies 2 3 3 4 dma solution 400 mg l 3 4 dma and 24 000 mg l nacl was prepared and reserves were stored in a refrigerator at 4 0 experimental solutions were prepared through the addition of 250 ml volume of stock solution and a certain content of other reagents such as nb tba in inhibition experiments and dmso in capture experiments into a 1 0 l brown volumetric flask 2 4 experiment method a 1 0 l dilution solution was poured to the reactor with the addition of 300 mg tio2 detailed character of the solution is shown in the table 1 the intermixture was maintained in the dark for 5 min and then it was applied by a current density of 70 ma cm2 in eco and hpeco and a uv irradiation of 12 w in pco and hpeco systems 10 0 ml effluent was filtrated by 0 22 μm polyether alum membrane at regular intervals subsequently the content of 3 4 dma hydroxyl radicals and free chlorine were analyzed by the detection of filtered solution ph was stabled by the injection of hcl in every 40 min all experiments were maintained at a ph of 3 0 a temperature of 25 0 and stirring at 300 r min 2 5 analytical method free chlorine was determined through portable residual chlorine analyzer l8115 hach and the result is accurate to 0 01 mg l toc and tn were measured by a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena dmso was added into the solution which could react with oh to form formaldehyde rapidly the content of oh was calculated by the measurement of formaldehyde abou et al 2017 the content of 3 4 dma was obtained via photometric measurement metoxyphenol using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu the intermediates were determined by the way of gc ms detection entech 7100 cds 5150 agilent 6890n 5975 the samples should be pre treated with the injection of proper amount of sodium thiosulfate and then they should be concentrated by extraction and rotary evaporation free radicals were captured by esr detection ex nano bruker the cyclic voltammetry spectra were recorded using an electrochemical workstation chi630e chenhua with a three electrode cell consisting of a pt sheet as a counter electrode an sce as a reference electrode and ti iro2 as a working electrode the potential was scanned at from 0 5 v to 2 5 v at 25 mv s 3 result and discussion 3 1 comparison of the three processes the removals of 3 4 dma toc and tn in pco eco and hpeco were investigated as shown in fig 2 for eco 18 29 of 3 4 dma was degraded after 2 min 29 87 of toc and 56 31 of tn were removed after 30 h under the same conditions 3 4 dma toc and tn removals were 1 40 52 and 27 39 for pco and they were 47 42 80 28 and 76 43 for hpeco the removal efficiencies of 3 4 dma and toc by hpeco could reach 2 45 and 1 14 times than the sum of efficiencies by other two systems separately therefore hpeco performed strong synergetic effect for 3 4 dma and toc degradation poor synergy was presented in tn removal which may be due to intensive selective degradation by chloride active species including cl2 and hclo eqs 1 2 produced in electrocatalytic process 24 it was noting that physical and chemical indexes all meet the chinese integrated wastewater discharge standard gb8978 1996 after 30 h treatment of hpeco such as cod 20 mg l toc 20 mg l tn 3 mg l and 3 4 dma 0 1 mg l 1 2 c l 2 e c l 2 2 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o h c l these three processes all exhibited different degradation trends in the removals of 3 4 dma tn and toc electrochemical process contributed to efficient degradation of 3 4 dma and tn but it had a negligible effect on toc removal though 3 4 dma and tn removals were not as efficient as eco photodegradation efficiency was much higher in toc removal in addition removal percentages and trends for 3 4 dma toc and tn were similar which was attributed to the unselective oxidation by oh during pco process a more effective oxidation was observed for hpeco compared to other two processes it was interesting that similar selective characteristic was also found in hpeco with more efficient removal in 3 4 dma and tn this was probably derived from the selective oxidation of active species produced in electrochemical degradation 25 3 2 change of main active species during synergistic degradation in combined systems ti iro2 anode would oxidize cl into hclo at a ph of 3 0 in electrochemical subsystem oh and crs could be produced through the decomposition of hclo under uv irradiation eqs 3 5 in addition oh could be also produced in photocatalytic subsystem eqs 6 11 3 h c l o h v o h c l 4 o h c l c l o h 5 c l c l c l 2 6 o 2 e o 2 7 h o 2 h o 2 8 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 e o h o h 10 h 2 o h v o h h 11 o h h v o h different experiments were carried on to figure out the oxidation mechanism during synergistic degradation as shown in fig sm 1 according to the test of cyclic voltammetry at initial 1 min of reaction the electrocatalytic subsystem could not produce an oxidation peak at the oxidation stage but a reduction peak appeared at the reduction stage with a peak value of about 0 989 v this result indicated that the degradation relied on the indirect oxidation rather than the direct oxidation in the presence of cl which was consistent with the result of feng 13 especially at a ph of 3 hclo was produced through the indirect oxidation and it would participate to the degradation of 3 4 dma in addition the scavenging experiments were conducted with the addition of various inhibitors in hpeco process as known tba could react with oh and cl nb could only react with oh 26 and edta could quench the photo induced holes 27 in the presence of cl 3 4 dma could be removed completely after 10 min without any additions when edta was added the degradation trend of 3 4 dma was not significantly changed however the addition of nb or tba inhibited the degradation greatly in the presence of so4 2 the degradation efficiency was extremely low with less than 10 removal after 10 min in a conclusion hclo exerted a significant in the degradation of 3 4 dma oh and cl could also play the important role which might be produced through the decomposition of hclo under uv irradiation epr tests were investigated at different reaction periods to obtain the further oxidation mechanism as for hpeco some characteristic peaks with very low strength were detected after 2 min this result indicated the main mechanism was not the oxidation by free radicals when degradation extended to 30 min 7 distinct characteristic peaks were detected which were similar to the characteristic peaks of dmpo x 9 10 and different from those detected at 2 min this may be due to the oxidation of free radicals such as oh and chlorine radical species crs at 60 min the peaks were consistent with those at 30 min but the strength increased significantly hence the initial of reaction mainly depended on the oxidation by hclo which achieved a rapid oxidation of nh2 groups of 3 4 dma molecules due to the selective oxidation it would lead to rapid degradation of 3 4 dma and tn the later reaction was mainly dependent on the oxidation of intermediates by oh and crs these radicals possess higher oxidizing ability and they could oxidize intermediates rapidly to achieve the efficient removal of toc this result could be responsible for an asynchronous removals for 3 4 dma tn and toc 3 3 three degradation periods corresponding to active species in order to find out the change of main active species and investigate the degradation mechanism during combined degradation hclo accumulative model was established according to the research of the comninellis and it was further optimized as eq 12 16 d h c l o d t k 0 k 1 o r g k 2 o h k 3 c l h c l o i 2 f v 12 d h c l o d t k 0 1 o r g k 1 k 2 o h o r g k 3 c l o r g o r g h c l o i 2 f v where hclo org oh and cl presented the concentrations of hypochlorous acid organic pollutants hydroxyl radicals and chlorine radicals f i and v presented faraday constant current intensity and the volume of the reaction region k0 presented the photolysis rate of hypochlorous acid k1 k2 and k3 presented the kinetic constants between hypochlorous acid and organic pollutants hypochlorous acid and hydroxyl radicals hypochlorous acid and chlorine radicals respectively the quantitative determination of hclo by three systems was shown in fig 3 a no free chlorines was detected in pco which indicated cl could not be oxidized into cl by photo induced holes thus unable to produce the free chloride such as cl2 as for eco and hpeco the accumulation concentration of hclo could be roughly divided into three periods slow accumulation period linear accumulation period and plateau period and the degradation characteristics of different periods by hpeco were shown as follows 1 slow accumulation period at initial 10 min hclo was generated on the ti iro2 anode and most was consumed by a large amount of organic substances in the solution this would lead to the low accumulation concentration of hclo and low yields of oh and cl hence the main oxidation mechanism was by hclo and the model could be further simplified as eq 13 13 d h c l o d t k 1 o r g h c l o i 2 f v 2 linear accumulation period 10 40 min the concentration of organic substances decreased during the prior period and hclo would therefore began to accumulate rapidly during this period the enhancement of hclo accumulation would result in more oh and crs 26 these species would participate in the oxidation simultaneously to achieve efficient degradation furthermore the accumulation rates of hclo were fitted in fig 3 a by both systems the result indicated that the rate in hpeco system was 28 umol min during linear accumulation period which was far below than that in eco system of 59 umol min and it was speculated that the decrease was caused by photolysis of hclo in order to investigate this conjecture uv irradiation was joined into eco system to analyze the change of hclo concentration as fig 3 b the content of free chlorine immediately dropped after uv irradiation it proved that hclo accumulated in the solution could be decomposed into oh and cl instantly in case of uv in addition oh could also be generated by photo induced holes in photocatalytic subsystem 28 it could be inferred that the yield of oh and cl was far more than 31 umol min which was much larger than the yield of hclo as a result the degradation mechanism was the main role of oh and crs to play this result was different from the first period 3 plateau period 40 min until finishing mineralization the decomposition and escape of free chlorine would lead to the stability of hclo accumulation concentration as fig 3 b the area surrounded by the cumulative plot of hclo in hpeco system and axis area presented the amount of hclo involved in the degradation reaction and the the area surrounded by the cumulative plot of hclo in hpeco and eco presented the amount of oh and crs involved in the degradation reaction according to the comparison of both areas the contribution of free radicals would be far greater than the contribution of the hclo with the extending of degradation time hence oh and crs were regarded as the dominant active reagents 3 4 degradation pathways and mechanism intermediates at different reation periods duting hpeco process were analyzed using gc ms fig sm 2 and all intermediates were presented in table sm 1 besides of 3 4 dma a very small amount of organic substances such as methylbenzene chlorobenzene and styrene were found before reaction at the reaction time of 7 min 3 4 dma benzaldehyde and the derivatives of benzoic acid were detected at 30 min benzene derivatives and a variety of small molecules such as 1 1 dimethyl 3 chloropropanol and 2 3 chloro 2 methylbutane were detected which indicated the opening of the benzene rings at 120 min and 240 min chlorobenzene methyl benzene p methyl benzene and alkanes were further determined as a result a complete degradation pathways fig 4 and mechansim were discovered as follows during hclo slow accumulation period the ti iro2 anode oxidized cl in the solution to hclo subsequently hclo attacked the side chains of 3 4 dma and oxidized it into 3 4 dimethylphenol 2 amino 6 methylbenzoic acid and 1 2 4 benzoic acid through the carboxylation and hydroxylation by hclo meanwhile a large amount of nh2 groups were removed by the selective oxidation of hclo during the linear accumulation periods hclo produced in electrochemical process began to rapid accumulate and most was decomposed into cl and oh under the uv irradiation these radicals could react with cl to form crs in addition oh could be produced by the photosis of tio2 under the co operation of crs and oh benzene rings of intermediates were oxidized by two ways the first was the direct oxidizing through the chlorination by crs and hydroxylation by oh the second was the indirect way which ch3 side chains were removed by decarboxylation to produce methylbenzene benzaldehyde and other substances and then the rings of them were opened through hydroxylation and chlorylation to form small molecules during the plateau period crs and oh could oxidize small molecules until mineralization however some small alkanes were possible to be recombined into some large molecules which slowed down the mineralization rate to some extent at this stage the concentration of tn was all but unchanged and part of chlorine dissociated from the system 3 5 synergistic mechanism in electrochemical degradation process it was proved that the addition of uv could achieve the photolysis of hclo to form more oh and cl with high oxidizing ability this would improve the degradation efficiency in photodegradation process metal plates were placed outside the reactor and different voltages were applied the change of oh was investigated by dimethysulfonate dmso under different voltages 29 as fig 5 a shown it was found that 4 84 μmol min oh was captured by dmso with no applied voltage when voltages were applied the capturing rate of oh increase to 5 86 μmol min until 1 5 v cm and then it decreased in case of 2 0 v cm the same condition with that by hpeco the rate was 5 05 μmol min with the increase of 4 5 hence both photo irradiation and electric applied field in hpeco could facilitate the production of active species compared to the individual process fig 5 b presented the change of do concentration at the same initial do concentrations 10 35 0 30 mg l in three systems in pco do concentration decreased continuously with the increase of reaction time and it reached 7 77 mg l at 140 min this result indicated the consuming of oxygen for generating oh in eco and hpeco the trend of do concentration was upward totally which was the attribution of oxygen evolution reaction oer by ti iro2 anode in particular the slope of do in hpeco was lower than that in eco all results proved that do produced by oer in electrocatalytic subsystem provided the acceptors for photo electrons in photocatalytic subsystem the yield of free radicals trapped by dmso was investigated when do 7 0 mg l and 11 0 mg l respectively the results were shown in fig 5 c when do 11 0 mg l the yield could reach 6 21 μmol min which was higher than the rate of 5 58 μmol min at do 11 0 mg l this indicated that increasing do concentration in the photocatalytic system could effectively improve the yield of oh in conclusion electrocatalytic system provided more dissolved oxygen for the photocatalytic system to achieve more oh which increased the degradation efficiency for synergistic degradation as many researched hocl and cl possess high selective oxidative ability in attacking electron rich groups such as nh2 cooh groups oh could also attack other groups efficiently such as ch3 groups and unsaturated carbon bonds 25 in order to investigate the synergy of different active species toc removal and the change of hclo concentration were studied comparatively under six conditions as fig 6 the toc removal was compared between s1 and s4 in s1 low removal efficiency was performed during degradation due to the function of only one kind of active substance hclo and 8 57 toc was removed after 6 h in s4 the trend of toc removal stabled at initial 2 h and then increased rapidly in the company of rapid accumulation and stability for hclo before and after 2 h reaction respectively these results indicated oh and crs facilitate the degradation of intermediates by hclo in similar the analysis of s2 and s5 indicated the existence of hclo and crs accelerated toc removal by oh furthermore alternating degradation by eco and pco was carried on in s6 the step up trend for toc removal proved the intense synergistic effect existed among oh crs and hclo gc ms detection during three different processes was shown in fig sm 3 and main intermediates were listed in table sm 2 in searching only a phenol derivative with oh groups and 3 4 dma existed in eco system this result suggested hclo performed selective attack on nh2 and worse oxidizing ability for ch3 of 3 4 dma it may defer the further degradation and toc removal however all side chains of 3 4 dma could be oxidized in pco and hpeco systems in the presence of oh 30 in particular many carboxylic acid derivatives with electron enriched groups were found in hepco such as dimethylbenzoic acid 4 amino 2 methylbenzoic acid and 1 2 4 benzenetricarboxylic acid as a result the reason for synergy among active substances was put forward as following two points 1 the existence of oh would facilitate the oxidation of side chains of 3 4 dma by hclo in the first 10 min slow accumulation period hclo produced in electrocatalytic subsystem could not oxidize ch3 side chains due to selective oxidation but with the assistance of few oh produced in pco subsystem all side chains could be oxidized into electron enriched groups of cooh which accelerated the opening of benzene rings 2 with the co operation among oh crs and hclo a large amount of intermediates with electron enriched groups were formed which was favor of the further rapid degradation by hclo and crs at 7 min benzoic acid and its derivatives were produced and they were further oxidized into small molecules such as 1 1 dimethyl 3 chlorine propanol these electron enriched matters could be regarded as bridge substances benefiting rapid and selective degradation in conclusion the reason for synergistic was following three points 1 applied electric field could accelerate the separation of photo generated holes and electrons to increase the yield of oh and uv light could decompose hclo into oh and crs for higher oxidizing ability in the solution 2 oxygen evolution reaction could provide electron acceptors o2 to increase the yield of oh 3 oh could further oxidize the side chains and intermediates into substances containing cooh groups which provided the bridge substances for crs and hclo to achieve the rapid selective oxidation 3 6 influence of controlling factors on synergistic degree to further investigate the synergy the contribution of it was defined as eqs 14 16 14 f 1 θ 1 θ 2 15 θ 1 k 1 k 100 16 θ 2 k 2 k 100 where f presented the contribution of synergy k k1 k2 presented the evaluation indicators toc removal rate or apparent rate constants by hpeco pco and eco separately and θ 1 presented the contribution of oh produced by pco θ 2 presented the contribution of hclo produced by eco 3 4 dma degradation efficiency varied dramatically for eco pco and hpeco processes to accurate investigate the influence of different controlling factors on synergy toc removals after 6 h were compared under different systems and the contributions of synergy were shown in fig 7 the trend of synergy decreased totally with the increase of reaction time for all conditions this was caused by the slow toc removal in eco and pco system at the initial of reaction it could be clearly found that the removal rate of toc and synergy degree increased continuously with the increase of current density by hpeco indicating that removal efficiency and synergistic degree could be improved by raising current density with the increase of current density more hclo was accumulated rapidly and decomposed into oh and crs furthermore the higher current density was supplied by higher the voltage which promoted the separation of photo generated holes and electrons and thus produced more oh synergistic effect was therefore improved with the co operation of hclo oh and crs as for uv power the enhancement of uv facilitated toc removal efficiency which was attributed to the improvement of the yields of oh and crs however uv power decreased the contribution of synergy with the increase of uv power the competition effect between hclo and tio2 was enhanced for uv irradiation and more hclo was decomposed this would lead to the disharmony of the concentration of active species and further decrease for synergistic effect during hpeco with the increase of ph toc removal efficiency and synergy contribution decreased in particular synergistic contribution decreased to negative values after 4 h reaction at a ph of 11 0 it indicated that the excellent performance under acid and neutral conditions and worse performance under alkaline conditions at ph ranging from 3 to 7 3 4 dma could achieve protonation it would be beneficial to the degradation of 3 4 dma itself hclo was produced and decomposed into oh and cl under uv irradiation which increased the oxidizing ability in the solution in addition the agglomeration of tio2 was reduced under acidic conditions leading to the increase of specific surface area these results would enhance the synergistic effects greatly while at ph 7 agglomeration was performed for tio2 and the content of hclo reduced significantly clo with lower oxidizing ability was dominant and it could be further decomposed into o and cl consequently with relatively poor oxidation capacity these results would lead to the weaker synergistic effects 3 7 treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater riboflavin is synthesized in a pharmaceutical factory in hubei province and large quantities of waste water is produced in synthesis process after some pre treatments including microelectrolysis and anaerobic bio reactor the quality of effluent of the secondary sedimentation tank is still not up to chinese national sewage standard and the detailed data is shown in table 2 in order to meet the emission standards the experiment was conducted by hpeco with 1 0 l effluent from secondary sedimentation tank under optimal degradation conditions of ph at 3 0 uv power at 12 w current density at 70 ma cm2 tio2 powder at 300 mg l 86 67 cod and 83 34 tn were removed and effluent would meet all requires in standard after 30 h degradation this result is consistent with the result for solution prepared in laboratory in a conclude hpeco showed high efficiency for wastewater containing 3 4 dma 4 conclusion this work established a novel method hpeco to treat 3 4 dma industrial wastewater and investigated its synergistic degradation mechanism hpeco possessed higher removal efficiency and the removal percentages of 3 4 dma and toc could reach 2 45 and 1 14 times than the sum of that by eco and pco respectively a three stage degradation was proposed according to various dominating active species during degradation hclo slow accumulation period linear accumulation period and plateau period in the first stage hclo attacked the side chains of 3 4 dma and oxidized it into derivatives of benzene acid and phenol in the second stage crs and oh could open the benzene rings of intermediates finally the small molecules were further mineralized under the co oxidation of crs and oh the reason for synergistic was following three points 1 increase of crs and oh by applied electric field and uv irradiation 2 increase of oh by oxygen evolution reaction 3 co operation among oh crs and hclo the contribution of synergy was positively correlated with current density and negative correlated with ph value and uv power during integrated degradation hepco performed high efficiency for pharmaceutical wastewater and 100 3 4 dma 86 67 cod and 83 34 tn were removed after 30 h degradation declaration

13818,3 4 dimethyl aniline is a stubborn organic matter and widely appears in many industrial wastewaters a novel method hybrid photo electrocatalytic oxidation hpeco combining photocatalytic oxidation pco with electrocatalytic oxidation eco was established to treat it the removal efficiencies were compared among hpeco pco and eco systems and the result suggested hpeco was 2 45 and 1 14 times higher than the sum of other two systems for 3 4 dma and toc removals separately furthermore a three stage mechanism was proposed in hpeco process by cyclic voltammetry esr and quantitative determination of hclo and a whole degradation pathway was deduced by gc ms in the first stages hclo attacked the side chains of 3 4 dma and oxidized it into 3 4 dimethylphenol 2 amino 6 methylbenzoic acid and 1 2 4 benzoic acid in the last two stages these intermediates were further degraded until mineralization under the co oxidation of chlorine radical species crs and oh in addition synergistic effect was studied with generating reason and controlling factors uv irradiation and applied voltage could increase the yields of oh and crs electrochemical process could also accelerate the production of oh through o2 evolution reaction the existence of oh could facilitate the transform of 3 4 dma into the intermediates containing cooh groups which provided the bridge substances for crs and hclo to achieve the rapid selective oxidation the further investigation found that synergistic effect was positively correlated with current density and negative correlated with ph and uv power finally pharmaceutical wastewater was treated with this novel method and it can be successfully removed to meet the chinese national sewage discharge standard after 30 h degradation keywords hybrid photo electrocatalytic oxidation hpeco 3 4 dimethyaniline oxidation mechanism synergistic mechanism synergistic contribution 1 introduction 3 4 dimethyl aniline 3 4 dma is an important fine chemical intermediate to synthesize riboflavin vitamin b2 and it can be widely used in pesticides antioxidants pharmaceuticals and personal care products 1 2 it has the ability to cause cancer and damage dna in biological cells 3 4 3 4 dma wastewater is always accompanied with a detrimental concentration of cl especially in industrial production 5 in a hand aniline compounds are environmentally persistent and hard to be oxidized by traditional biodegradation processes due to their biotoxicity 6 7 in the other hand cl reduces biodegradability and increases the treatment difficulties for organic wastewater 8 so it is urgent to discover a new method to solve these problems the focus of the current study is on the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic processes 9 12 photocatalytic oxidation pco is dependent on the direct degradation by oh oh could oxidize most of objective organic substances and intermediates during degradation due to its strong oxidizing property the complete and environment friendly degradation would be therefore achieved in the treatment of organic wastewater however the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes reduces the production of oh and it becomes a major barrier to efficient degradation for pco 13 14 in order to reduce recombination and improve degradation efficiency more and more newly composite catalysts were researched and developed such as v2o5 tio2 rgo tio2 wo3 tio2 and c n co doped tio2 for its better removal performance at high conductivity electrocatalytic oxidation eco becomes a popular method for the wastewater with high salinity 15 recently many coated electrodes were under investigation for a higher efficiency such as ti iro2 ti pbo2 ti sno2 ti ruo2 and bdd ti iro2 is considered as an active anode material in which could produce free chlorines including cl2 hclo and clo in the presence of cl 16 however many toxic intermediates would remain in the effluent and even enter into environment to bring secondary pollution through electrochemical process 17 the combination of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis would solve these problems efficiently compared to individual eco and pco so the combined process hybrid photo electrocatalytic oxidation was established in combined system ti iro2 anode would oxidize cl into free chlorine in the solution and then free chlorine could be decomposed into oh and cl under uv irradiation this reaction was coincident to the photo assisted electrocatalytic oxidation peo as previous studies 18 20 unlike the previous study of peo the dispersed tio2 was added into hpeco system this would allow o2 to be the bridge substance for co operation degradation in a hand o2 would be produced greatly through the oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalytic subsystem 21 in another hand it could also be the recipient for photo generated electrons to improve the production of photo generated oh in photocatalytic subsystem 22 23 furthermore the applied voltage could accelerate the separation of photo generated carriers for dispersed tio2 which would increase the yield of photo generated oh under the co operation of these species a synergistic effect may be occurred and more efficient degradation would be obtained in hpeco as far as the authors are aware there are many studies about individual electrocatalytic and photocatalytic treatments of aniline organics and there are fewer studies about the combined degradation between them in this study combined process hpeco was investigated with the comparison of other two treatments and the combined degradation pathway and mechanism were further studied interestingly this paper proved the existence of the synergistic effect between pco and eco this paper was mainly intended to figure out the causes and controlling factors for synergistic effect in order to enhance this effect and improve degradation efficiency however the recycle and reuse of tio2 catalyst may hinder the widespread use of hpeco in the industrial production this problem should be explored for next investigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents 3 4 dma sodium sulfate sodium chloride tertiary butanol nitrobenzene

was submerged in the reactor for the photodegradation studies 2 3 3 4 dma solution 400 mg l 3 4 dma and 24 000 mg l nacl was prepared and reserves were stored in a refrigerator at 4 0 experimental solutions were prepared through the addition of 250 ml volume of stock solution and a certain content of other reagents such as nb tba in inhibition experiments and dmso in capture experiments into a 1 0 l brown volumetric flask 2 4 experiment method a 1 0 l dilution solution was poured to the reactor with the addition of 300 mg tio2 detailed character of the solution is shown in the table 1 the intermixture was maintained in the dark for 5 min and then it was applied by a current density of 70 ma cm2 in eco and hpeco and a uv irradiation of 12 w in pco and hpeco systems 10 0 ml effluent was filtrated by 0 22 μm polyether alum membrane at regular intervals subsequently the content of 3 4 dma hydroxyl radicals and free chlorine were analyzed by the detection of filtered solution ph was stabled by the injection of hcl in every 40 min all experiments were maintained at a ph of 3 0 a temperature of 25 0 and stirring at 300 r min 2 5 analytical method free chlorine was determined through portable residual chlorine analyzer l8115 hach and the result is accurate to 0 01 mg l toc and tn were measured by a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena dmso was added into the solution which could react with oh to form formaldehyde rapidly the content of oh was calculated by the measurement of formaldehyde abou et al 2017 the content of 3 4 dma was obtained via photometric measurement metoxyphenol using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu the intermediates were determined by the way of gc ms detection entech 7100 cds 5150 agilent 6890n 5975 the samples should be pre treated with the injection of proper amount of sodium thiosulfate and then they should be concentrated by extraction and rotary evaporation free radicals were captured by esr detection ex nano bruker the cyclic voltammetry spectra were recorded using an electrochemical workstation chi630e chenhua with a three electrode cell consisting of a pt sheet as a counter electrode an sce as a reference electrode and ti iro2 as a working electrode the potential was scanned at from 0 5 v to 2 5 v at 25 mv s 3 result and discussion 3 1 comparison of the three processes the removals of 3 4 dma toc and tn in pco eco and hpeco were investigated as shown in fig 2 for eco 18 29 of 3 4 dma was degraded after 2 min 29 87 of toc and 56 31 of tn were removed after 30 h under the same conditions 3 4 dma toc and tn removals were 1 40 52 and 27 39 for pco and they were 47 42 80 28 and 76 43 for hpeco the removal efficiencies of 3 4 dma and toc by hpeco could reach 2 45 and 1 14 times than the sum of efficiencies by other two systems separately therefore hpeco performed strong synergetic effect for 3 4 dma and toc degradation poor synergy was presented in tn removal which may be due to intensive selective degradation by chloride active species including cl2 and hclo eqs 1 2 produced in electrocatalytic process 24 it was noting that physical and chemical indexes all meet the chinese integrated wastewater discharge standard gb8978 1996 after 30 h treatment of hpeco such as cod 20 mg l toc 20 mg l tn 3 mg l and 3 4 dma 0 1 mg l 1 2 c l 2 e c l 2 2 c l 2 h 2 o h c l o h c l these three processes all exhibited different degradation trends in the removals of 3 4 dma tn and toc electrochemical process contributed to efficient degradation of 3 4 dma and tn but it had a negligible effect on toc removal though 3 4 dma and tn removals were not as efficient as eco photodegradation efficiency was much higher in toc removal in addition removal percentages and trends for 3 4 dma toc and tn were similar which was attributed to the unselective oxidation by oh during pco process a more effective oxidation was observed for hpeco compared to other two processes it was interesting that similar selective characteristic was also found in hpeco with more efficient removal in 3 4 dma and tn this was probably derived from the selective oxidation of active species produced in electrochemical degradation 25 3 2 change of main active species during synergistic degradation in combined systems ti iro2 anode would oxidize cl into hclo at a ph of 3 0 in electrochemical subsystem oh and crs could be produced through the decomposition of hclo under uv irradiation eqs 3 5 in addition oh could be also produced in photocatalytic subsystem eqs 6 11 3 h c l o h v o h c l 4 o h c l c l o h 5 c l c l c l 2 6 o 2 e o 2 7 h o 2 h o 2 8 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 9 h 2 o 2 e o h o h 10 h 2 o h v o h h 11 o h h v o h different experiments were carried on to figure out the oxidation mechanism during synergistic degradation as shown in fig sm 1 according to the test of cyclic voltammetry at initial 1 min of reaction the electrocatalytic subsystem could not produce an oxidation peak at the oxidation stage but a reduction peak appeared at the reduction stage with a peak value of about 0 989 v this result indicated that the degradation relied on the indirect oxidation rather than the direct oxidation in the presence of cl which was consistent with the result of feng 13 especially at a ph of 3 hclo was produced through the indirect oxidation and it would participate to the degradation of 3 4 dma in addition the scavenging experiments were conducted with the addition of various inhibitors in hpeco process as known tba could react with oh and cl nb could only react with oh 26 and edta could quench the photo induced holes 27 in the presence of cl 3 4 dma could be removed completely after 10 min without any additions when edta was added the degradation trend of 3 4 dma was not significantly changed however the addition of nb or tba inhibited the degradation greatly in the presence of so4 2 the degradation efficiency was extremely low with less than 10 removal after 10 min in a conclusion hclo exerted a significant in the degradation of 3 4 dma oh and cl could also play the important role which might be produced through the decomposition of hclo under uv irradiation epr tests were investigated at different reaction periods to obtain the further oxidation mechanism as for hpeco some characteristic peaks with very low strength were detected after 2 min this result indicated the main mechanism was not the oxidation by free radicals when degradation extended to 30 min 7 distinct characteristic peaks were detected which were similar to the characteristic peaks of dmpo x 9 10 and different from those detected at 2 min this may be due to the oxidation of free radicals such as oh and chlorine radical species crs at 60 min the peaks were consistent with those at 30 min but the strength increased significantly hence the initial of reaction mainly depended on the oxidation by hclo which achieved a rapid oxidation of nh2 groups of 3 4 dma molecules due to the selective oxidation it would lead to rapid degradation of 3 4 dma and tn the later reaction was mainly dependent on the oxidation of intermediates by oh and crs these radicals possess higher oxidizing ability and they could oxidize intermediates rapidly to achieve the efficient removal of toc this result could be responsible for an asynchronous removals for 3 4 dma tn and toc 3 3 three degradation periods corresponding to active species in order to find out the change of main active species and investigate the degradation mechanism during combined degradation hclo accumulative model was established according to the research of the comninellis and it was further optimized as eq 12 16 d h c l o d t k 0 k 1 o r g k 2 o h k 3 c l h c l o i 2 f v 12 d h c l o d t k 0 1 o r g k 1 k 2 o h o r g k 3 c l o r g o r g h c l o i 2 f v where hclo org oh and cl presented the concentrations of hypochlorous acid organic pollutants hydroxyl radicals and chlorine radicals f i and v presented faraday constant current intensity and the volume of the reaction region k0 presented the photolysis rate of hypochlorous acid k1 k2 and k3 presented the kinetic constants between hypochlorous acid and organic pollutants hypochlorous acid and hydroxyl radicals hypochlorous acid and chlorine radicals respectively the quantitative determination of hclo by three systems was shown in fig 3 a no free chlorines was detected in pco which indicated cl could not be oxidized into cl by photo induced holes thus unable to produce the free chloride such as cl2 as for eco and hpeco the accumulation concentration of hclo could be roughly divided into three periods slow accumulation period linear accumulation period and plateau period and the degradation characteristics of different periods by hpeco were shown as follows 1 slow accumulation period at initial 10 min hclo was generated on the ti iro2 anode and most was consumed by a large amount of organic substances in the solution this would lead to the low accumulation concentration of hclo and low yields of oh and cl hence the main oxidation mechanism was by hclo and the model could be further simplified as eq 13 13 d h c l o d t k 1 o r g h c l o i 2 f v 2 linear accumulation period 10 40 min the concentration of organic substances decreased during the prior period and hclo would therefore began to accumulate rapidly during this period the enhancement of hclo accumulation would result in more oh and crs 26 these species would participate in the oxidation simultaneously to achieve efficient degradation furthermore the accumulation rates of hclo were fitted in fig 3 a by both systems the result indicated that the rate in hpeco system was 28 umol min during linear accumulation period which was far below than that in eco system of 59 umol min and it was speculated that the decrease was caused by photolysis of hclo in order to investigate this conjecture uv irradiation was joined into eco system to analyze the change of hclo concentration as fig 3 b the content of free chlorine immediately dropped after uv irradiation it proved that hclo accumulated in the solution could be decomposed into oh and cl instantly in case of uv in addition oh could also be generated by photo induced holes in photocatalytic subsystem 28 it could be inferred that the yield of oh and cl was far more than 31 umol min which was much larger than the yield of hclo as a result the degradation mechanism was the main role of oh and crs to play this result was different from the first period 3 plateau period 40 min until finishing mineralization the decomposition and escape of free chlorine would lead to the stability of hclo accumulation concentration as fig 3 b the area surrounded by the cumulative plot of hclo in hpeco system and axis area presented the amount of hclo involved in the degradation reaction and the the area surrounded by the cumulative plot of hclo in hpeco and eco presented the amount of oh and crs involved in the degradation reaction according to the comparison of both areas the contribution of free radicals would be far greater than the contribution of the hclo with the extending of degradation time hence oh and crs were regarded as the dominant active reagents 3 4 degradation pathways and mechanism intermediates at different reation periods duting hpeco process were analyzed using gc ms fig sm 2 and all intermediates were presented in table sm 1 besides of 3 4 dma a very small amount of organic substances such as methylbenzene chlorobenzene and styrene were found before reaction at the reaction time of 7 min 3 4 dma benzaldehyde and the derivatives of benzoic acid were detected at 30 min benzene derivatives and a variety of small molecules such as 1 1 dimethyl 3 chloropropanol and 2 3 chloro 2 methylbutane were detected which indicated the opening of the benzene rings at 120 min and 240 min chlorobenzene methyl benzene p methyl benzene and alkanes were further determined as a result a complete degradation pathways fig 4 and mechansim were discovered as follows during hclo slow accumulation period the ti iro2 anode oxidized cl in the solution to hclo subsequently hclo attacked the side chains of 3 4 dma and oxidized it into 3 4 dimethylphenol 2 amino 6 methylbenzoic acid and 1 2 4 benzoic acid through the carboxylation and hydroxylation by hclo meanwhile a large amount of nh2 groups were removed by the selective oxidation of hclo during the linear accumulation periods hclo produced in electrochemical process began to rapid accumulate and most was decomposed into cl and oh under the uv irradiation these radicals could react with cl to form crs in addition oh could be produced by the photosis of tio2 under the co operation of crs and oh benzene rings of intermediates were oxidized by two ways the first was the direct oxidizing through the chlorination by crs and hydroxylation by oh the second was the indirect way which ch3 side chains were removed by decarboxylation to produce methylbenzene benzaldehyde and other substances and then the rings of them were opened through hydroxylation and chlorylation to form small molecules during the plateau period crs and oh could oxidize small molecules until mineralization however some small alkanes were possible to be recombined into some large molecules which slowed down the mineralization rate to some extent at this stage the concentration of tn was all but unchanged and part of chlorine dissociated from the system 3 5 synergistic mechanism in electrochemical degradation process it was proved that the addition of uv could achieve the photolysis of hclo to form more oh and cl with high oxidizing ability this would improve the degradation efficiency in photodegradation process metal plates were placed outside the reactor and different voltages were applied the change of oh was investigated by dimethysulfonate dmso under different voltages 29 as fig 5 a shown it was found that 4 84 μmol min oh was captured by dmso with no applied voltage when voltages were applied the capturing rate of oh increase to 5 86 μmol min until 1 5 v cm and then it decreased in case of 2 0 v cm the same condition with that by hpeco the rate was 5 05 μmol min with the increase of 4 5 hence both photo irradiation and electric applied field in hpeco could facilitate the production of active species compared to the individual process fig 5 b presented the change of do concentration at the same initial do concentrations 10 35 0 30 mg l in three systems in pco do concentration decreased continuously with the increase of reaction time and it reached 7 77 mg l at 140 min this result indicated the consuming of oxygen for generating oh in eco and hpeco the trend of do concentration was upward totally which was the attribution of oxygen evolution reaction oer by ti iro2 anode in particular the slope of do in hpeco was lower than that in eco all results proved that do produced by oer in electrocatalytic subsystem provided the acceptors for photo electrons in photocatalytic subsystem the yield of free radicals trapped by dmso was investigated when do 7 0 mg l and 11 0 mg l respectively the results were shown in fig 5 c when do 11 0 mg l the yield could reach 6 21 μmol min which was higher than the rate of 5 58 μmol min at do 11 0 mg l this indicated that increasing do concentration in the photocatalytic system could effectively improve the yield of oh in conclusion electrocatalytic system provided more dissolved oxygen for the photocatalytic system to achieve more oh which increased the degradation efficiency for synergistic degradation as many researched hocl and cl possess high selective oxidative ability in attacking electron rich groups such as nh2 cooh groups oh could also attack other groups efficiently such as ch3 groups and unsaturated carbon bonds 25 in order to investigate the synergy of different active species toc removal and the change of hclo concentration were studied comparatively under six conditions as fig 6 the toc removal was compared between s1 and s4 in s1 low removal efficiency was performed during degradation due to the function of only one kind of active substance hclo and 8 57 toc was removed after 6 h in s4 the trend of toc removal stabled at initial 2 h and then increased rapidly in the company of rapid accumulation and stability for hclo before and after 2 h reaction respectively these results indicated oh and crs facilitate the degradation of intermediates by hclo in similar the analysis of s2 and s5 indicated the existence of hclo and crs accelerated toc removal by oh furthermore alternating degradation by eco and pco was carried on in s6 the step up trend for toc removal proved the intense synergistic effect existed among oh crs and hclo gc ms detection during three different processes was shown in fig sm 3 and main intermediates were listed in table sm 2 in searching only a phenol derivative with oh groups and 3 4 dma existed in eco system this result suggested hclo performed selective attack on nh2 and worse oxidizing ability for ch3 of 3 4 dma it may defer the further degradation and toc removal however all side chains of 3 4 dma could be oxidized in pco and hpeco systems in the presence of oh 30 in particular many carboxylic acid derivatives with electron enriched groups were found in hepco such as dimethylbenzoic acid 4 amino 2 methylbenzoic acid and 1 2 4 benzenetricarboxylic acid as a result the reason for synergy among active substances was put forward as following two points 1 the existence of oh would facilitate the oxidation of side chains of 3 4 dma by hclo in the first 10 min slow accumulation period hclo produced in electrocatalytic subsystem could not oxidize ch3 side chains due to selective oxidation but with the assistance of few oh produced in pco subsystem all side chains could be oxidized into electron enriched groups of cooh which accelerated the opening of benzene rings 2 with the co operation among oh crs and hclo a large amount of intermediates with electron enriched groups were formed which was favor of the further rapid degradation by hclo and crs at 7 min benzoic acid and its derivatives were produced and they were further oxidized into small molecules such as 1 1 dimethyl 3 chlorine propanol these electron enriched matters could be regarded as bridge substances benefiting rapid and selective degradation in conclusion the reason for synergistic was following three points 1 applied electric field could accelerate the separation of photo generated holes and electrons to increase the yield of oh and uv light could decompose hclo into oh and crs for higher oxidizing ability in the solution 2 oxygen evolution reaction could provide electron acceptors o2 to increase the yield of oh 3 oh could further oxidize the side chains and intermediates into substances containing cooh groups which provided the bridge substances for crs and hclo to achieve the rapid selective oxidation 3 6 influence of controlling factors on synergistic degree to further investigate the synergy the contribution of it was defined as eqs 14 16 14 f 1 θ 1 θ 2 15 θ 1 k 1 k 100 16 θ 2 k 2 k 100 where f presented the contribution of synergy k k1 k2 presented the evaluation indicators toc removal rate or apparent rate constants by hpeco pco and eco separately and θ 1 presented the contribution of oh produced by pco θ 2 presented the contribution of hclo produced by eco 3 4 dma degradation efficiency varied dramatically for eco pco and hpeco processes to accurate investigate the influence of different controlling factors on synergy toc removals after 6 h were compared under different systems and the contributions of synergy were shown in fig 7 the trend of synergy decreased totally with the increase of reaction time for all conditions this was caused by the slow toc removal in eco and pco system at the initial of reaction it could be clearly found that the removal rate of toc and synergy degree increased continuously with the increase of current density by hpeco indicating that removal efficiency and synergistic degree could be improved by raising current density with the increase of current density more hclo was accumulated rapidly and decomposed into oh and crs furthermore the higher current density was supplied by higher the voltage which promoted the separation of photo generated holes and electrons and thus produced more oh synergistic effect was therefore improved with the co operation of hclo oh and crs as for uv power the enhancement of uv facilitated toc removal efficiency which was attributed to the improvement of the yields of oh and crs however uv power decreased the contribution of synergy with the increase of uv power the competition effect between hclo and tio2 was enhanced for uv irradiation and more hclo was decomposed this would lead to the disharmony of the concentration of active species and further decrease for synergistic effect during hpeco with the increase of ph toc removal efficiency and synergy contribution decreased in particular synergistic contribution decreased to negative values after 4 h reaction at a ph of 11 0 it indicated that the excellent performance under acid and neutral conditions and worse performance under alkaline conditions at ph ranging from 3 to 7 3 4 dma could achieve protonation it would be beneficial to the degradation of 3 4 dma itself hclo was produced and decomposed into oh and cl under uv irradiation which increased the oxidizing ability in the solution in addition the agglomeration of tio2 was reduced under acidic conditions leading to the increase of specific surface area these results would enhance the synergistic effects greatly while at ph 7 agglomeration was performed for tio2 and the content of hclo reduced significantly clo with lower oxidizing ability was dominant and it could be further decomposed into o and cl consequently with relatively poor oxidation capacity these results would lead to the weaker synergistic effects 3 7 treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater riboflavin is synthesized in a pharmaceutical factory in hubei province and large quantities of waste water is produced in synthesis process after some pre treatments including microelectrolysis and anaerobic bio reactor the quality of effluent of the secondary sedimentation tank is still not up to chinese national sewage standard and the detailed data is shown in table 2 in order to meet the emission standards the experiment was conducted by hpeco with 1 0 l effluent from secondary sedimentation tank under optimal degradation conditions of ph at 3 0 uv power at 12 w current density at 70 ma cm2 tio2 powder at 300 mg l 86 67 cod and 83 34 tn were removed and effluent would meet all requires in standard after 30 h degradation this result is consistent with the result for solution prepared in laboratory in a conclude hpeco showed high efficiency for wastewater containing 3 4 dma 4 conclusion this work established a novel method hpeco to treat 3 4 dma industrial wastewater and investigated its synergistic degradation mechanism hpeco possessed higher removal efficiency and the removal percentages of 3 4 dma and toc could reach 2 45 and 1 14 times than the sum of that by eco and pco respectively a three stage degradation was proposed according to various dominating active species during degradation hclo slow accumulation period linear accumulation period and plateau period in the first stage hclo attacked the side chains of 3 4 dma and oxidized it into derivatives of benzene acid and phenol in the second stage crs and oh could open the benzene rings of intermediates finally the small molecules were further mineralized under the co oxidation of crs and oh the reason for synergistic was following three points 1 increase of crs and oh by applied electric field and uv irradiation 2 increase of oh by oxygen evolution reaction 3 co operation among oh crs and hclo the contribution of synergy was positively correlated with current density and negative correlated with ph value and uv power during integrated degradation hepco performed high efficiency for pharmaceutical wastewater and 100 3 4 dma 86 67 cod and 83 34 tn were removed after 30 h degradation declaration

13819,txp 10 is a commercial member of alkylphenol polyethoxylate surfactant family that is widely adopted as emulsifier detergent and dispersing agent in agriculture and industry however it has adverse effects on environmental and public health due to the risk of eutrophication oestrogenic activities and anti precipitation properties here we evaluated critical parameters and addressed the mechanism of aeration assisted photodegradation of txp 10 by using tio2 particulates as model photocatalysts it was found that o2 aeration could significantly enhance photocatalytic degradation efficiencies with a high synergetic index of 3 30 at an optimum rutile composition of 90 wt trapping experiments and superoxide radical quantification suggest two parallel mechanism pathways o2 sensitive and insensitive dependent on phase composition of photocatalyst and irradiation intensity furthermore the anti precipitation property of txp 10 solution during photocatalysis was evaluated and correlated to transformation of hydrophobic groups to hydrophilic derivatives this work would gain important enlightenment into the mechanism of synergistic effect of aeration assisted photocatalysis and its essential role in the environmental remediation keywords mechanism aeration assisted photocatalysis reactive oxygen species anti precipitation propertyalkylphenol 1 introduction alkylphenol compounds are widely used as surface active agents around the world with increasing quantities 1 particularly txp 10 polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether phosphate an ionic commercial surfactant scheme 1 has been heavily adapted in industrial agricultural and household products owing to their low costs as well as excellent emulsification capability 2 as a consequence the high levels txp 10 discharge into water bodies and their environmental risks are subject of much debate for example txp 10 contains phosphorus that causes eutrophication that adversely affects aquatic ecosystems and water quality nonylphenol which is generated during the biodegradation of txp 10 has been shown to have higher toxicity persistence estrogenic activity at ppb level and tendency towards bioaccumulation than the parent substrate 3 6 moreover txp 10 is detrimental for wastewater purification processes since it can act as an anti scalant with significant anti precipitation effect which hinders precipitation and flocculation 7 this posts a high risk on public health by reducing removal efficiencies of heavy metal hence in 2003 the european union has started to restrict the use of nonylphenol under directive no 2003 53 ec while the u s environmental protection agency epa also recommended to phase out such compounds however many developing nations such as china still heavily rely on the use of such chemicals photocatalysis sometimes combined with other techniques 2 8 14 is a sustainable environmentally friendly and potentially inexpensive approach to convert recalcitrant organic pollutants into harmless small molecules such as co2 and h2o through oxidative degradation 15 tio2 is a promising photocatalyst for pollutant degradation because of its high stability low toxicity and availability 16 owing to the excellent oxidation capacity of photogenerated holes h in the tio2 valence band 2 9 v vs nhe upon uv irradiation tio2 nanomaterials are able to cleave most carbon related bonds in organic materials 17 on the other hand superoxide o2 can be readily produced by the tio2 conduction band electrons e 0 3 v vs nhe via single electron transfer mechanism 18 those reactive oxidation species ros along with hydroxyl radicals oh are expected to play important roles in mineralization of organic contaminants recently intensive research efforts have been dedicated to the removal of alkylphenol compounds in aqueous systems jaafarzadeh et al 13 investigated photocatalytic removal of nonylphenol by using carbon doped tio2 with various anatase rutile compositions and found that photogenerated h and o2 were main ros in the system hu et al 7 reported that ozonation could reduce the anti precipitation property of organophosphorus surfactant which was crucial for reverse osmosis ro system our previous work found that rutile rich tio2 preferably facilitates o2 mediated photocatalytic processes 19 20 to the best of our knowledge little attention has been paid to the synergetic effect between catalyst surface arrangement and aeration process 21 22 nawawi et al 21 found that the photocatalytic activity performance of immobilized tio2 peg for methylene blue degradation was the highest at 75 ml min 1 aeration rate furthermore the quantitative correlation between photodegradation of txp 10 and their anti precipitation properties remain elusive therefore it is appealing to investigate the synergistic effect and mechanisms of aeration assisted photodegradation in this work we chose commercial txp 10 surfactant as a representative alkylphenol pholyethoxylate contaminant and well defined tio2 as a model photocatalyst the objectives of the present study are to examine the advantage of combining photocatalysis and o2 aeration and investigate the critical parameters and mechanism pathways of txp 10 photodegradation in context of light intensity ros generation and phase compositions of photocatalysts 2 experimental method 2 1

purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china and used as received without further purification txp 10 was purchased from jiangsu haian petrochemical company all other chemicals used in this work were analytical reagent grade and di water was used throughout this study 2 2 preparation of tio2 samples the tio2 materials with well defined phase compositions were prepared by a simple thermal treatment method similar to our previous work 19 in a typical experimental procedure the p25 tio2 powder was heated in a tube furnace using ceramic reactor to various temperatures 500 600 650 700 and 800 c with a ramp rate of 15 c min 1 and maintaining the temperature for 5 h in air the resulting samples are noted as 500 5 600 5 650 5 700 5 and 800 5 respectively as a result tio2 samples with various anatase rutile compositions were obtained 2 3 characterization morphologies of tio2 particles were examined by a tecnai g2f20 stwin fei us transmission electron microscope tem crystallinity

horiba jobin yvon france raman spectrophotometer with a laser wavelength of 532 nm and a uv 3600 shimadzu japan uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs was utilized to analyze the light absorption properties the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas of the samples were gained via nitrogen n2 adsorption desorption using a v sorb2800 p analyzer gold app china apparatus and surface area was calculated with a multi point method the infrared transmission spectra were recorded on a nicolet 380 diffuse reflection fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer thermofisher scientific us using 1500 g l 1 txp 10 aqueous solution as starting materials 2 4 photocatalytic test the photocatalytic removal of txp 10 was performed under uv vis light illumination typically 10 mg photocatalyst was dispersed into 65 ml of 100 mg l 1 txp 10 aqueous solution in a quartz reaction vessel before illumination the mixed suspension was sonicated for 10 min and vigorously stirred for 30 min under dark conditions to attain an adsorption desorption equilibrium of the photocatalyst and txp 10 solution and then irradiated by a 500 w high pressure hg lamp 7 104 or 1 5 104 lux the o2 aeration flow rate was controlled by lzb 3wb flow meter at every 5 min a small portion of the solution sample was centrifuged at 10 000 rmp to determine the concentration of the txp 10 in supernatant fraction using uv vis spectrometer according to reported methods 6 23 where the concentrations of pollutants were assumed to be proportional to uv vis absorbance the degradation efficiency was calculated by c0 ct c0 100 where c0 was the initial concentration of txp 10 after equilibrium to discount the adsorption in the dark and ct was the concentration at time t a pseudo first order relationship was employed to fit the photocatalytic reaction and its kinetics was expressed as ln ct c0 kt based on langmuir hinshelwood model 24 where k is the apparent rate constant the synergistic effect of aeration assisted photocatalysis process was quantified by synergistic index si ka l ka kl where ka l ka and kl are apparent rate constants for aeration assisted photocatalysis o2 aeration and photocatalysis processes respectively the ph value was monitored in situ by a smartchem ph meter thermo scientific calcium carbonate precipitation method was used to investigate anti precipitation property of each treated sample according to chinese national standard gb t 16632 2008 and reported methods 7 2 5 radical trapping experiments to clarify the effect of ros on txp 10 photodegradation 1 0 mm ipa isopropyl alcohol a quencher of o h and teoa triethanolamine a quencher of h were applied to the testing respectively 25 the o2 production rate was estimated by using 30 mg l 1 nbt by measuring the absorbance at 259 nm of nbt solution 26 the rest of the procedures were identical to photocatalytic test measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalysts characterization we prepared a range of tio2 photocatalysts with different anatase rutile compositions according to our previous methods 19 the distinctive surface characteristics of different tio2 phases were first analyzed by raman spectroscopy fig 1 a the 500 5 sample mainly shows anatase vibrational modes with peak positions at 144 196 397 516 517 which is superimposed by the 516 cm 1 peak and 638 cm 1 respectively however emerging peaks at 239 446 and 610 cm 1 were observed after thermal treatment at higher temperatures the raman analysis also confirmed that no brookite phase was observed in any sample in this work this is consistent with xrd patterns as shown in fig 1b which correspond to anatase phase jcpds no 21 1272 and rutile phase jcpds no 89 4920 of tio2 the phase compositions of the tio2 samples were determined with spurr and myers equation and displayed in table 1 27 the 500 5 sample was found to mainly contain 92 wt anatase whereas the rutile percentage increased to 83 wt after 700 c treatment and further to 100 wt at 800 c an understanding of the transformation of anatase to rutile is of great importance to study tio2 for photocatalysis or other applications 33 it is well known that rutile is the stable phase of tio2 at all temperatures and pressures anatase is metastable but it can be considered to be kinetically stabilised at lower temperatures in other words although rutile is the more stable phase from a thermodynamic point of view anatase frequently is the product phase in the synthesis of tio2 owing to its less constrained structure and consequent enhanced kinetics of formation anatase is considered widely to begin to transform irreversibly to rutile in air at 600 c because sufﬁcient thermal energy is required to facilitate the rearrangement of atoms nonetheless the anatase to rutile transformation is not instantaneous it is time dependent because it is a reconstructive nucleation and growth process uv vis spectrums in fig 1c show that prepared samples only exhibit absorption in the ultraviolet range attributed to the electron excitation from valence band to conduction band of tio2 rather than the visible light region the absorption band edge reduced from 3 22 ev to 3 08 ev with increasing treatment temperatures from 500 to 800 c n2 adsorption isotherms were conducted to determine the specific surface area an increase in the treatment temperature leads to a significant decrease of sbet from 46 97 to 6 9 m2 g 1 which is shown in fig 1d and table 1 the decrease in the surface area with heating temperature is associated with a sintering process of p25 tio2 nanoparticles 34 in other words the surface area of heat treated tio2 decreased due to the crystal growth as well as the coalescence 35 3 2 txp 10 removal performance the photocatalytic degradation performances of different tio2 samples were first evaluated without o2 aeration under a low irradiation of 1 5 104 lux fig 2 a represents typical txp 10 uv vis spectra in aqueous solution during reaction which comprise two maxima a relatively weak peak at around 275 nm representing the aromatic rings and a relatively intense peak at around 223 nm where polyethoxylated moieties shows uv absorbance 13 23 28 both absorbance peaks of the txp 10 aqueous solution decreased apparently with increasing reaction time implying the shortening of the ethoxylate chains and the opening of the aromatic ring furthermore no additional absorbance peak appears indicating that no intermediates with absorbance in uv vis range were produced during the photocatalytic reaction in this work the absorbance at 223 nm was used to quantify txp 10 degradation as shown in fig 2b by comparing photocatalytic activities of different tio2 samples it is observed that the degradation efficiencies of tio2 treated at lower temperatures were superior to those treated at higher temperatures for instance about 70 5 txp 10 was degraded by 500 5 tio2 while only 6 1 txp 10 was degraded by 800 5 tio2 after 20 min reaction in a control experiment negligible degradation was observed in the absence of catalysts fig 2b by employing a pseudo first order approximation implying molecular conversion at catalyst surface is dominating it can be seen that the apparent rate constant of 500 5 tio2 0 06446 min 1 was about 28 times that of 800 5 sample 0 00232 min 1 and about 6 times that of 700 5 sample 0 01165 min 1 as shown in fig 2c this is probably due to reduced surface areas of tio2 after thermal heating leading to a lower electron hole separation rate fig 1d 3 3 effect of o2 aeration fig 3 a depicts the time course of txp 10 photodegradation with o2 aeration rate of 30 ml min 1 it seems that o2 aeration can significantly enhance txp 10 degradation over rutile rich tio2 in comparison with anatase rich tio2 with an increase in o2 aeration rate from 0 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 the degradation efficiencies of tio2 samples consisting 8 20 60 and 90 wt rutile increase from 70 5 64 8 64 3 and 20 3 to 70 9 74 3 67 0 and 43 6 respectively meanwhile the corresponding apparent rate constants increased from 0 06466 min 1 0 05501 min 1 0 05186 min 1 and 0 01165 min 1 to 0 06569 min 1 0 07345 min 1 0 0592 min 1 and 0 02652 min 1 respectively on the basis of photocatalytic data it can be concluded that o2 aeration greatly enhanced photocatalytic activities of rutile rich tio2 samples whereas the reaction rates in anatase rich tio2 was quite similar to that observed for txp 10 without o2 aeration furthermore the synergistic index si for txp 10 photodegradation assisted by 30 ml min 1 o2 aeration were calculated to be 0 98 1 29 1 10 and 1 93 respectively despite the si values of prepared samples were all close to or higher than 1 0 indicating an apparent synergistic effect the optimum si value of 1 93 was found over 90 wt rutile tio2 sample those results indicate that phase compositions of tio2 samples play an important role in the synergetic behavior of aeration assisted photocatalysis it is worth noting that 100 wt rutile tio2 shows a low si of 0 80 which is less than 1 00 implying that excess amount of rutile in tio2 particulates presents negative effect for txp 10 decomposition nevertheless the positive role of o2 aeration in txp 10 photocatalysis should be emphasized and synergetic effect between o2 aeration and photocatalysis can be an optimized by tuning phase composition of tio2 3 4 dominant ros analysis to identify the dominant reactive species the ros trapping experiments were performed with well known radical scavengers and direct photocatalysis was used as the control test fig 4 a displays the trapping experiment of ros for txp 10 degradation without o2 aeration at a low light intensity of 1 5 104 lux by adding 1 0 mm teoa a h scavenger into reaction solution it was found that the txp 10 degradation efficiencies for three tio2 samples 8 wt 60 wt and 90 wt rutile obviously decreased from 70 5 64 3 and 20 3 to 15 1 18 8 and 13 4 respectively indicating the degradation processes were all significantly inhibited whereas introducing 1 0 mm ipa a quencher of o h shows little effect on the reaction for all these samples this means that h rather than o h is the main ros for all tio2 samples towards txp 10 degradation in aqueous solution on the other hand when the o2 aeration rate of 30 ml min 1 was applied it was found that the relative contribution of h and o h was greatly dependent on the phase composition of tio2 for example fig 4b shows that degradation efficiency of 8 wt rutile greatly decreased from 70 9 to 37 8 after adding 1 0 mm teoa but was hardly affected by adding 1 0 mm ipa whereas 60 wt and 90 wt rutile tio2 show significant decline in degradation efficiencies with either teoa or ipa addition in other words it seems that only h played dominant role in anatase rich tio2 while both h and o h radical were major active radicals involved in photocatalytic reaction on rutile rich tio2 to determine whether other competitive degradation routes are also operating nbt a colorless molecular probe was used to detect o2 for tio2 samples with different phase compositions fig 4c shows the time course of nbt consumption with and without o2 aeration in both situations it was found that o2 production rates decrease slightly with increasing rutile percentage but still significant this can be ascribed to lower sbet of tio2 samples when treated at higher temperatures e g 46 97 m2 g 1 for 500 5 tio2 vs 14 38 m2 g 1 for 700 5 tio2 as shown in table 1 given that o2 was also important for decomposition of nonylphenol as well as other pollutants 13 19 it is reasonable to infer that h and o2 were the main ros in all txp 10 degradation systems regardless of phase composition and o2 aeration while o h only played essential role on rutile rich tio2 in presence of o2 aeration 3 5 effect of irradiation intensity the absorption spectra of txp 10 solution under strong irradiation without o2 aeration is shown in fig 5 under a high light intensity of 7 104 lux a rapid peak intensity decrease at 223 nm in comparison with 275 nm was observed during the initial photoirradiation period of 10 min exhibiting an induction period from a kinetic point of view this can be ascribed to a competitive attack by the radicals on the ethoxylated chains or the aromatic ring of txp 10 in other words ros generated on the tio2 surface prefer to oxidize the ethoxylated chains rather than the aromatic ring and thus the decrease of peak intensity at 275 nm was significantly retarded furthermore it is observed that aromatic ring also quickly decomposed after 10 min photo reaction which is consistent with previous study that besides the shortening of ethoxylate chains ros such as o h radicals could contribute to oxidative activation of benzene ring leading to ring opening 29 nevertheless the immediate decrease of ethoxylated chain concentration supports the view that ethoxylated chains were easier to be oxidized than benzene ring as to the effect of phase composition of tio2 on photocatalytic activities under high light irradiation of 7 104 lux the highest si of 3 30 was obtained on 90 wt rutile tio2 which is consistent with and even higher than that at low light intensity the influence of light intensity on involved ros was also investigated different to the results obtained at low irradiation of 1 5 104 lux where ros contribution depends on o2 aeration and rutile anatase ratio it was found that h plays dominant role in comparison with o h in all cases furthermore a synergetic effect can be observed between o2 aeration and rutile rich tio2 which dramatically facilitated o2 production fig 4d it was found that o2 production rates increased with increasing percentage of rutile in the presence of 30 ml min 1 o2 aeration whereas those o2 production rates were close for different tio2 phase compositions without o2 aeration this is also on the contrary to the behavior of tio2 samples under low light irradiation of 1 5 104 lux where o2 production rate decreased with increasing rutile percentage regardless of o2 aeration rates 3 6 anti precipitation property the goal of the txp 10 degradation is not only the pollutant degradation but also to minimize anti precipitation effect which can be evaluated by assessment of the anti precipitation ratio 7 fig 6 depicts a specific curve of anti precipitation ratios as a function of reaction time apparently the anti precipitation ratio decreased with increasing reaction time of photocatalysis which indicates the surface activity of generated intermediates was low this can be ascribed to transformation of hydrophobic alkyl chain and aromatic ring to hydrophilic derivatives containing carboxyl groups based on analysis of ftir spectra and ph variation fig 7 presents typical ftir spectra of txp 10 as a function of illumination time the absorption peaks at 2800 3000 cm 1 1608 cm 1 1511 cm 1 and 1456 cm 1 are due to the c h stretching vibrations cc stretching vibrations in aromatic ring c h bending vibrations and ch2 deformations respectively 30 those peaks gradually disappeared with increasing irradiation time indicating that both alkyl chains and aromatic rings were removed by photocatalysis of the tio2 which is consistent with the uv vis spectrum in fig 2a importantly a new peak at 1725 cm 1 corresponding to co stretching frequency of carboxyl group in their acidic form 31 appeared first during the initial 0 210 min and then decreased during the following 210 420 min this demonstrates the formation of carboxyl group and eventual mineralization of hydrophilic derivatives 36 this is also supported by ph measurement the ph values of txp 10 solution as a function of illumination time was presented in fig 8 which shows the txp 10 solution gradually becomes acidic at presence of photocatalysts as a result of carboxyl group formation 3 7 mechanism pathway based on above discussion the o2 aeration assisted photocatalytic mechanism pathway over tio2 is proposed and illustrated in scheme 2 under uv light irradiation the e in the tio2 valence band are boosted to the conduction band leaving the h in the valence band those charge carriers could interact with o2 and h2o to initiate complex radical chain reactions 32 the dependence of the txp 10 decomposition rate on the o2 aeration rate can be explained by existence of two parallel pathways that are involved in the reaction 1 h mediated degradation is less sensitive to the presence of o2 2 o2 mediated process can be significantly retarded at a low concentration of o2 our previous work demonstrated that anatase rich tio2 prefers h mediated route for pollutant decomposition while high ratio of rutile in tio2 favors o2 facilitated degradation pathway by providing active sites 19 furthermore higher light intensity was expected to increase the concentration of photo generated electrons for o2 production therefore it is reasonable that a higher si could be obtained on rutile rich tio2 and a synergetic effect between o2 aeration and rutile rich tio2 could be observed especially under higher light irradiation nevertheless the experimental observations highlight a major bottleneck of aeriation assisted photocatalysis given the mismatch between high photocatalytic activity of anatase rich tio2 and high si value of rutile rich tio2 in this study 4 conclusion to sum up a significant increase in the rate constant was observed for photocatalytic txp 10 degradation under application of o2 aeration with the highest si of 3 30 achieved by 90 wt rutile tio2 in aqueous solution the effect of phase composition light intensity and aeration rates were clarified two parallel degradation pathways were observed where o2 aeration could greatly enhance o2 production rate on rutile rich tio2 but had less effect on h mediated photocatalysis process on anatase rich tio2 the improved anti precipitation property of txp 10 solution during photocatalysis was ascribed to the transformation of hydrophobic groups to hydrophilic derivatives containing carboxyl groups this study is expected to pave the way to expand o2 aeration assisted photocatalysis for the purification of wastewater containing alkylphenol contaminants declaration of competing

13819,txp 10 is a commercial member of alkylphenol polyethoxylate surfactant family that is widely adopted as emulsifier detergent and dispersing agent in agriculture and industry however it has adverse effects on environmental and public health due to the risk of eutrophication oestrogenic activities and anti precipitation properties here we evaluated critical parameters and addressed the mechanism of aeration assisted photodegradation of txp 10 by using tio2 particulates as model photocatalysts it was found that o2 aeration could significantly enhance photocatalytic degradation efficiencies with a high synergetic index of 3 30 at an optimum rutile composition of 90 wt trapping experiments and superoxide radical quantification suggest two parallel mechanism pathways o2 sensitive and insensitive dependent on phase composition of photocatalyst and irradiation intensity furthermore the anti precipitation property of txp 10 solution during photocatalysis was evaluated and correlated to transformation of hydrophobic groups to hydrophilic derivatives this work would gain important enlightenment into the mechanism of synergistic effect of aeration assisted photocatalysis and its essential role in the environmental remediation keywords mechanism aeration assisted photocatalysis reactive oxygen species anti precipitation propertyalkylphenol 1 introduction alkylphenol compounds are widely used as surface active agents around the world with increasing quantities 1 particularly txp 10 polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether phosphate an ionic commercial surfactant scheme 1 has been heavily adapted in industrial agricultural and household products owing to their low costs as well as excellent emulsification capability 2 as a consequence the high levels txp 10 discharge into water bodies and their environmental risks are subject of much debate for example txp 10 contains phosphorus that causes eutrophication that adversely affects aquatic ecosystems and water quality nonylphenol which is generated during the biodegradation of txp 10 has been shown to have higher toxicity persistence estrogenic activity at ppb level and tendency towards bioaccumulation than the parent substrate 3 6 moreover txp 10 is detrimental for wastewater purification processes since it can act as an anti scalant with significant anti precipitation effect which hinders precipitation and flocculation 7 this posts a high risk on public health by reducing removal efficiencies of heavy metal hence in 2003 the european union has started to restrict the use of nonylphenol under directive no 2003 53 ec while the u s environmental protection agency epa also recommended to phase out such compounds however many developing nations such as china still heavily rely on the use of such chemicals photocatalysis sometimes combined with other techniques 2 8 14 is a sustainable environmentally friendly and potentially inexpensive approach to convert recalcitrant organic pollutants into harmless small molecules such as co2 and h2o through oxidative degradation 15 tio2 is a promising photocatalyst for pollutant degradation because of its high stability low toxicity and availability 16 owing to the excellent oxidation capacity of photogenerated holes h in the tio2 valence band 2 9 v vs nhe upon uv irradiation tio2 nanomaterials are able to cleave most carbon related bonds in organic materials 17 on the other hand superoxide o2 can be readily produced by the tio2 conduction band electrons e 0 3 v vs nhe via single electron transfer mechanism 18 those reactive oxidation species ros along with hydroxyl radicals oh are expected to play important roles in mineralization of organic contaminants recently intensive research efforts have been dedicated to the removal of alkylphenol compounds in aqueous systems jaafarzadeh et al 13 investigated photocatalytic removal of nonylphenol by using carbon doped tio2 with various anatase rutile compositions and found that photogenerated h and o2 were main ros in the system hu et al 7 reported that ozonation could reduce the anti precipitation property of organophosphorus surfactant which was crucial for reverse osmosis ro system our previous work found that rutile rich tio2 preferably facilitates o2 mediated photocatalytic processes 19 20 to the best of our knowledge little attention has been paid to the synergetic effect between catalyst surface arrangement and aeration process 21 22 nawawi et al 21 found that the photocatalytic activity performance of immobilized tio2 peg for methylene blue degradation was the highest at 75 ml min 1 aeration rate furthermore the quantitative correlation between photodegradation of txp 10 and their anti precipitation properties remain elusive therefore it is appealing to investigate the synergistic effect and mechanisms of aeration assisted photodegradation in this work we chose commercial txp 10 surfactant as a representative alkylphenol pholyethoxylate contaminant and well defined tio2 as a model photocatalyst the objectives of the present study are to examine the advantage of combining photocatalysis and o2 aeration and investigate the critical parameters and mechanism pathways of txp 10 photodegradation in context of light intensity ros generation and phase compositions of photocatalysts 2 experimental method 2 1

purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd shanghai china and used as received without further purification txp 10 was purchased from jiangsu haian petrochemical company all other chemicals used in this work were analytical reagent grade and di water was used throughout this study 2 2 preparation of tio2 samples the tio2 materials with well defined phase compositions were prepared by a simple thermal treatment method similar to our previous work 19 in a typical experimental procedure the p25 tio2 powder was heated in a tube furnace using ceramic reactor to various temperatures 500 600 650 700 and 800 c with a ramp rate of 15 c min 1 and maintaining the temperature for 5 h in air the resulting samples are noted as 500 5 600 5 650 5 700 5 and 800 5 respectively as a result tio2 samples with various anatase rutile compositions were obtained 2 3 characterization morphologies of tio2 particles were examined by a tecnai g2f20 stwin fei us transmission electron microscope tem crystallinity

properties the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface areas of the samples were gained via nitrogen n2 adsorption desorption using a v sorb2800 p analyzer gold app china apparatus and surface area was calculated with a multi point method the infrared transmission spectra were recorded on a nicolet 380 diffuse reflection fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer thermofisher scientific us using 1500 g l 1 txp 10 aqueous solution as starting materials 2 4 photocatalytic test the photocatalytic removal of txp 10 was performed under uv vis light illumination typically 10 mg photocatalyst was dispersed into 65 ml of 100 mg l 1 txp 10 aqueous solution in a quartz reaction vessel before illumination the mixed suspension was sonicated for 10 min and vigorously stirred for 30 min under dark conditions to attain an adsorption desorption equilibrium of the photocatalyst and txp 10 solution and then irradiated by a 500 w high pressure hg lamp 7 104 or 1 5 104 lux the o2 aeration flow rate was controlled by lzb 3wb flow meter at every 5 min a small portion of the solution sample was centrifuged at 10 000 rmp to determine the concentration of the txp 10 in supernatant fraction using uv vis spectrometer according to reported methods 6 23 where the concentrations of pollutants were assumed to be proportional to uv vis absorbance the degradation efficiency was calculated by c0 ct c0 100 where c0 was the initial concentration of txp 10 after equilibrium to discount the adsorption in the dark and ct was the concentration at time t a pseudo first order relationship was employed to fit the photocatalytic reaction and its kinetics was expressed as ln ct c0 kt based on langmuir hinshelwood model 24 where k is the apparent rate constant the synergistic effect of aeration assisted photocatalysis process was quantified by synergistic index si ka l ka kl where ka l ka and kl are apparent rate constants for aeration assisted photocatalysis o2 aeration and photocatalysis processes respectively the ph value was monitored in situ by a smartchem ph meter thermo scientific calcium carbonate precipitation method was used to investigate anti precipitation property of each treated sample according to chinese national standard gb t 16632 2008 and reported methods 7 2 5 radical trapping experiments to clarify the effect of ros on txp 10 photodegradation 1 0 mm ipa isopropyl alcohol a quencher of o h and teoa triethanolamine a quencher of h were applied to the testing respectively 25 the o2 production rate was estimated by using 30 mg l 1 nbt by measuring the absorbance at 259 nm of nbt solution 26 the rest of the procedures were identical to photocatalytic test measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 photocatalysts characterization we prepared a range of tio2 photocatalysts with different anatase rutile compositions according to our previous methods 19 the distinctive surface characteristics of different tio2 phases were first analyzed by raman spectroscopy fig 1 a the 500 5 sample mainly shows anatase vibrational modes with peak positions at 144 196 397 516 517 which is superimposed by the 516 cm 1 peak and 638 cm 1 respectively however emerging peaks at 239 446 and 610 cm 1 were observed after thermal treatment at higher temperatures the raman analysis also confirmed that no brookite phase was observed in any sample in this work this is consistent with xrd patterns as shown in fig 1b which correspond to anatase phase jcpds no 21 1272 and rutile phase jcpds no 89 4920 of tio2 the phase compositions of the tio2 samples were determined with spurr and myers equation and displayed in table 1 27 the 500 5 sample was found to mainly contain 92 wt anatase whereas the rutile percentage increased to 83 wt after 700 c treatment and further to 100 wt at 800 c an understanding of the transformation of anatase to rutile is of great importance to study tio2 for photocatalysis or other applications 33 it is well known that rutile is the stable phase of tio2 at all temperatures and pressures anatase is metastable but it can be considered to be kinetically stabilised at lower temperatures in other words although rutile is the more stable phase from a thermodynamic point of view anatase frequently is the product phase in the synthesis of tio2 owing to its less constrained structure and consequent enhanced kinetics of formation anatase is considered widely to begin to transform irreversibly to rutile in air at 600 c because sufﬁcient thermal energy is required to facilitate the rearrangement of atoms nonetheless the anatase to rutile transformation is not instantaneous it is time dependent because it is a reconstructive nucleation and growth process uv vis spectrums in fig 1c show that prepared samples only exhibit absorption in the ultraviolet range attributed to the electron excitation from valence band to conduction band of tio2 rather than the visible light region the absorption band edge reduced from 3 22 ev to 3 08 ev with increasing treatment temperatures from 500 to 800 c n2 adsorption isotherms were conducted to determine the specific surface area an increase in the treatment temperature leads to a significant decrease of sbet from 46 97 to 6 9 m2 g 1 which is shown in fig 1d and table 1 the decrease in the surface area with heating temperature is associated with a sintering process of p25 tio2 nanoparticles 34 in other words the surface area of heat treated tio2 decreased due to the crystal growth as well as the coalescence 35 3 2 txp 10 removal performance the photocatalytic degradation performances of different tio2 samples were first evaluated without o2 aeration under a low irradiation of 1 5 104 lux fig 2 a represents typical txp 10 uv vis spectra in aqueous solution during reaction which comprise two maxima a relatively weak peak at around 275 nm representing the aromatic rings and a relatively intense peak at around 223 nm where polyethoxylated moieties shows uv absorbance 13 23 28 both absorbance peaks of the txp 10 aqueous solution decreased apparently with increasing reaction time implying the shortening of the ethoxylate chains and the opening of the aromatic ring furthermore no additional absorbance peak appears indicating that no intermediates with absorbance in uv vis range were produced during the photocatalytic

molecular conversion at catalyst surface is dominating it can be seen that the apparent rate constant of 500 5 tio2 0 06446 min 1 was about 28 times that of 800 5 sample 0 00232 min 1 and about 6 times that of 700 5 sample 0 01165 min 1 as shown in fig 2c this is probably due to reduced surface areas of tio2 after thermal heating leading to a lower electron hole separation rate fig 1d 3 3 effect of o2 aeration fig 3 a depicts the time course of txp 10 photodegradation with o2 aeration rate of 30 ml min 1 it seems that o2 aeration can significantly enhance txp 10 degradation over rutile

increase from 70 5 64 8 64 3 and 20 3 to 70 9 74 3 67 0 and 43 6 respectively meanwhile the corresponding apparent rate constants increased from 0 06466 min 1 0 05501 min 1 0 05186 min 1 and 0 01165

rutile rich tio2 samples whereas the reaction rates in anatase rich tio2 was quite similar to that observed for txp 10 without o2 aeration furthermore the synergistic index si for txp 10 photodegradation assisted by 30 ml min 1 o2 aeration were calculated to be 0 98 1 29 1 10 and 1 93 respectively despite the si values of prepared samples were all close to or higher than 1 0

aeration rates 3 6 anti precipitation property the goal of the txp 10 degradation is not only the pollutant degradation but also to minimize anti precipitation effect which can be evaluated by assessment of the anti precipitation ratio 7 fig 6 depicts a specific curve of anti precipitation ratios as a function of reaction time apparently the anti precipitation ratio decreased with increasing reaction time of photocatalysis which indicates the surface activity of generated intermediates was low this can be ascribed to transformation of hydrophobic alkyl chain and aromatic ring to hydrophilic derivatives containing carboxyl groups based on analysis of ftir spectra and ph variation fig 7 presents typical ftir spectra of txp 10 as a function of illumination time the absorption peaks at 2800 3000 cm 1 1608 cm 1 1511 cm 1 and 1456 cm 1 are due to the c h stretching vibrations cc stretching vibrations in aromatic ring c h bending vibrations and ch2 deformations respectively 30 those peaks gradually disappeared with increasing irradiation time indicating that both alkyl chains and aromatic rings were removed by photocatalysis of the tio2 which is consistent with the uv vis spectrum in fig 2a importantly a new peak at 1725 cm 1 corresponding to co stretching frequency of carboxyl group in their acidic form 31 appeared first during the initial 0 210 min and then decreased during the following 210 420 min this demonstrates the formation of carboxyl group and eventual mineralization of hydrophilic derivatives 36 this is also supported by ph measurement the ph values of txp 10 solution as a function of illumination time was presented in fig 8 which shows the txp 10 solution gradually becomes acidic at presence of photocatalysts as a result of carboxyl group formation 3 7 mechanism pathway based on above discussion the o2 aeration assisted photocatalytic mechanism pathway over tio2 is proposed and illustrated in scheme 2 under uv light irradiation the e in the tio2 valence band are boosted to the conduction band leaving the h in the valence band those charge carriers could interact with o2 and h2o to initiate complex radical chain reactions 32 the dependence of the txp 10 decomposition rate on the o2 aeration rate can be explained by existence of two parallel pathways that are involved in the reaction 1 h mediated degradation is less sensitive to the presence of o2 2 o2 mediated process can be significantly retarded at a low concentration of o2 our previous work demonstrated that anatase rich tio2 prefers h mediated route for pollutant decomposition while high ratio of rutile in tio2 favors o2 facilitated degradation pathway by providing active sites 19 furthermore higher light intensity was expected to increase the concentration of photo generated electrons for o2 production therefore it is reasonable that a higher si could be obtained on rutile rich tio2 and a synergetic effect between o2 aeration and rutile rich tio2 could be observed especially under higher light irradiation nevertheless the experimental observations highlight a major bottleneck of aeriation assisted photocatalysis given the mismatch between high photocatalytic activity of anatase rich tio2 and high si value of rutile rich tio2 in this study 4 conclusion to sum up a significant increase in the rate constant was observed for photocatalytic txp 10 degradation under application of o2 aeration with the highest si of 3 30 achieved by 90 wt rutile tio2 in aqueous solution the effect of phase composition light intensity and aeration rates were clarified two parallel degradation pathways were observed where o2 aeration could greatly enhance o2 production rate on rutile rich tio2 but had less effect on h mediated photocatalysis process on anatase rich tio2 the improved anti precipitation property of txp 10 solution during photocatalysis was ascribed to the transformation of hydrophobic groups to hydrophilic derivatives containing carboxyl groups this study is expected to pave the way to expand o2 aeration assisted photocatalysis for the purification of wastewater containing alkylphenol contaminants declaration of competing
