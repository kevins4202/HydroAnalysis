of petroleum and petrochemicals dalian 116045 china electrochemical softening is an effective technology for the treatment of circulating cooling water but its hardness removal efficiency is limited because that nucleation and growth of scale crystals depended on cathode surface in this study a novel method was proposed to break through this limit via spatiotemporal management of nucleation and growth processes a cube reactor was divided into cathodic chamber and anodic chamber via installing a sandwich structure module composed of mesh cathode nylon nets and mesh anode using this continuous flowing electrochemical reactor oh generated by water electrolysis was rapidly pushed away from cathode surface by water flow and hydrogen bubbles movement as a result a wide range of strongly alkaline regions was rapidly constructed in cathodic chamber to play a nucleation region and homogeneous nucleation in liquid phase replaced heterogeneous nucleation on cathodic surface furthermore the growth process of scale crystals in alkaline regions was monitored in situ it took only 150 s of residence time to grow to 500 nm which may be easily separated from water by a microfiltration membrane with this new method the precipitation rate was 290 8 g hˑm2 and corresponding energy consumption was 2 1 kw h kg caco3 both were superior to those reported values therefore this study developed an efficient electrochemical softening method by spatial and temporal regulation of homogeneous nucleation and crystal growth processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water softening electrochemistry alkaline region homogeneous nucleation crystal growth data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cooling water is a necessary heat transfer medium in equipment manufacturing thermoelectric metallurgy petrochemical and coal chemical industries its consumption account is more than 60 of total industrial water wu et al 2009 therefore cyclic utilization is necessary to save water resources evaporation loss will continuously increase ion concentration of circulating cooling water ccw then caco3 and other substances with high thermal resistance precipitate on the surface of heat exchangers or pipelines resulting in decline of heat exchange efficiency pipeline blockage and corrosion brastad and he 2013 jiang et al 2015 zarga et al 2013 strategies involved scale inhibition and softening as typical scale inhibition technologies scale inhibitor and magnetization only delay scaling but not remove ca2 from ccw due to ion accumulation during recycling process high hardness water has to be discharged dirany et al 2016 zhu et al 2021 the softening techniques such as reverse osmosis freire gormaly and bilton 2019 electrodialysis han 2022 and ion exchange comstock and boyer 2014 are troubled by membrane fouling or exchange capacity declining sohn et al 2005 macadam and parsons 2004 chemical softening is the most commonly used method in ccw treatment hori et al 2021 during chemical softening naoh is added into ccw to provide ohˉ which may react with hco3 and ca2 to form caco3 with ph value increasing to 9 6 caco3 nucleation will accelerate and then crystal nucleus gather and grow until large enough to be separated from ccw via gravitational sedimentation de lannoy et al 2018 sharifian et al 2022 this method is widely used because it can actually remove the scaling ions and does not use membrane or resins as an upgraded version of chemical softening electrochemical softening produce ohˉ in situ by water reduction reaction on cathodic surface carré et al 2020 xu et al 2020 the tedious processes of transporting storing and adding naoh are avoided and oh concentration may be precisely regulated due to obvious operation and cost advantages commercial electrochemical softening equipment has emerged zhang et al 2020 in electrochemical water softening process because ohˉ anions are formed on cathodic surface caco3 crystals nucleate accumulate and grow on cathodic surface it leads to a general belief that electrochemical softening depends on heterogeneous nucleation emmel et al 2022 and has a spatial constraint adjacent to cathodic surface consequently most published papers have focused on increasing the effective cathodic area the typical large surface area cathodes involve mesh cathode li et al 2020 luan et al 2019 porous cathode rinat et al 2005 stainless steel wool cathode sanjuán et al 2019 and so on indeed the enhanced cathodic area improve effectively hardness removal efficiency to 29 16 g hˑm2 and significantly reduce energy consumption to 6 0 kw h kg caco3 luan et al 2019 however insulating caco3 layer deposited on cathodic surface leads to increase of resistance which hinders electrochemical generation of ohˉ in order to ensure the effectiveness of electrochemical softening the scale layer covering cathodic surface has to be removed by polarity reversal jin et al 2021 mechanical scraping krzyzanowski et al 2003 and ultrasonic cleaning qu et al 2020 reluctantly softening process has to be interrupted during descaling and regeneration of cathodes to break through spatial constraints of scaling on cathodic surface some recent papers have made a useful exploration a piece of porous carbon fiber felt was placed in front of cathode to provide additional effective area for nucleus aggregation and growth which may prevent the electromigration of ca2 to cathode and reduce scaling on cathode surface yang et al 2022 in a new seed system alkaline solution were produced via electrolyzing soft water then poured into a crystallizer where caco3 crystal seeds were preplaced to assist nucleation and growth because electrochemical reaction is separated from nucleation and growth processes cathode scaling may be completely avoided this method displayed a high precipitation rate of 300 g hˑm2 and energy consumption was only 4 6 kw h kg caco3 hasson et al 2010 the softening performance of this seed system can be further improved by using bipolar film with hardness removal efficiency up to 630 g hˑm2 and energy consumption as low as 1 2 kw h kg caco3 zaslavschi et al 2013 although these methods effectively improve softening capacity the essence is still heterogeneous nucleation and softening performance is limited by effective crystallization area if nucleation occurs in solution rather than solid surface the spatial constraints may be eliminated thoroughly in fact the above mentioned chemical softening follows homogeneous nucleation in liquid phase however after homogeneous nucleation crystals need relatively long time to grow large enough for spontaneous precipitation the solid liquid separation technology can effectively avoid the time consumed by crystals growth which may obviously reduce both energy consumption and reactor volume recently jiang et al reported an energetic improvement to shorten the time waiting for growth of crystals liu et al 2022 they used ti tubular microfilter to separate caco3 after crystal diameter close to 0 15 mm which was far below that would precipitate spontaneously thereby its descaling efficiency and energy consumption were 348 8 g caco3 hˑm2 and 1 88 kw h kg caco3 respectively these values were already at the outstanding level in the literatures however it still takes a relatively long time from just nucleation to growth to 0 15 mm in size based on the above analysis both spatial and temporal constraints are the difficulty of electrochemical method in ccw softening from the spatial perspective ca2 and hco3ˉ required in the nucleation process are dissolved and ubiquitous in ccw and ohˉ becomes the key factor for determining the nucleation position as long as ohˉ produced on cathode surface is quickly migrated to bulk ccw and accumulates to a certain concentration bulk ccw will become the nucleation region instead of solid surface such as electrode fence seed etc breaking the location limit from the temporal perspective the emigration of ca2 from liquid phase to solid phase is completed by caco3 nucleation following by aggregation and growth of crystal nucleus and separation from ccw this is a time consuming process if separation of scale crystals from water is performed as soon as crystal size exceeds the diameter of membrane pores waiting time for crystals to grow will be saved herein an electrochemical system of expanding homogeneous nucleation region and reducing crystal growth during was proposed and its performance in spatial and temporal regulation of homogeneous nucleation and crystal growth was verified it opens up a new route for electrochemical water softening to improve efficiency and save energy 2 experimental section 2 1 electrode module and reactor as shown in fig 1 an electrode module with sandwich structure was composed of mesh cathode insulated nylon nets and mesh anode the cathode was made by several stainless steel ss meshes and the size for one piece of ss mesh was 100 0 mm 100 0 mm 0 3 mm the anode was ruo2 iro2 tio2 coated ti mesh 100 0 mm 100 0 mm 1 0 mm seven pieces of nylon net 400 mesh were insert the gap 2 0 mm between two electrodes the thickness of each nylon net was 0 1 mm this electrode module was installed into a cube reactor and divided the reactor into a cathode chamber 350 ml and an anode chamber 50 ml 2 2 electrochemical softening experiments simulated ccw was prepared using ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm including cacl2 3 0 mmol l mgcl2 2 0 mmol l nahco3 6 0 mmol l and na2so4 0 05 mol l the total hardness in caco3 was 500 0 mg l including 300 0 mg l of calcium hardness and 200 0 mg l of magnesium hardness the initial alkalinity ph and conductivity of simulated ccw was 6 0 mmol l 8 1 and 8000 0 μs cm respectively a direct current power supply ps 3010d ⅱ output current 0 10 a was employed to provide constant current for sequencing batch experiments magnetic stirring in cathode chamber was set at 500 rpm during the electrochemical softening process ph value in cathodic chamber was monitored in situ with a ph meter phs 3e shanghai china water samples were taken at a certain interval filtered via polyethersulfone membrane pes 0 22 μm of porous diameter and then tested hardness for calculating the weight of scale deposited on cathodic surface stainless steel meshes before and after used were weighed after drying in an oven under 80 c for 10 min for continuous flowing experiment fig 2 simulated ccw flowed parallelly to the cathode surface through the cathode chamber and then entered a separator where solid liquid separation was accomplished by microfiltration membrane ph monitoring and hardness testing were same as those of sequential batch experiments 2 3 analysis the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were measured using edta titration chinese standards gb t 15 452 2009 the alkalinity was detected by indicator titration chinese standards gb t 15 451 2006 the conductivity was measured by multi parameter water quality detector multi 3430 beijing china the turbidity was tested by turbidimeter wgz 200 shanghai china the size and microstructure of scale crystal samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi japan equipped with energy disperse spectroscopy eds the crystal structure was analyzed by x ray diffractometer xrd smartlab 9kw japan the test method for co3 2ˉ was shown in supporting information 2 4 calculation energy consumption ec kw h kg caco3 is calculated with the following eq 1 1 e c u i t c 0 c t v 10 3 where u is voltage v i is current a t is reaction time h c0 and ct is hardness caco3 mg l in initial solution and at time t respectively v is volume of treated solution l the calculation formulas for current efficiency and homogeneous nucleation ratio were listed in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 regulation of alkaline region the key to strengthen homogeneous nucleation and suppress heterogeneous nucleation is to generate a large range of ohˉ regions ohˉ anions are produced from water reduction at cathodes as the equation h2o 2e h2 2 ohˉ if without any intervention most of ohˉ anions will be neutralized by h cations which are the product of anodic reaction the usual approach to prevent neutralization is to set up a proton exchange membrane pem between cathode and anode in this study several layers of nylon nets were used to block the movement of bubbles and then weaken the ion diffusion between the cathode chamber and the anode chamber as fig 3 a displayed no matter how many mesh nylon nets were used ph value in cathode region rises rapidly to 9 from 0 min to 5 min after 5 min of reaction nylon nets with different meshes brought distinguishing ph tendency for 100 mesh and 200 mesh nylon nets ph values in cathode chamber fluctuated at 9 5 and the corresponding ph of the anode chamber gradually decreased with the reaction time and dropped to around 2 5 at the 30th minute fig s1 it meant that there was a balance between the production of ohˉ via water electrolysis and the consumption by forming scale crystals in addition some ohˉ passed through nylon nets to the anode chamber with the movement of hydrogen bubbles which weakened the interference of h on the alkaline region of the cathode chamber while the diffusion of ohˉ to anode chamber was slight and may be ignored when the nylon nets structure was 400 mesh 7 layers fig s2 for nylon nets with larger holes 40 mesh or no nylon net ph value dropped below 9 at the 30th minute while for 400 mesh nylon net ph value increased with the reaction time moreover the increment is positively correlated with layer number of nylon nets taking 7 layers of 400 mesh nylon nets as an example ph value of cathode chamber reached 11 5 after 30 min of reaction and the corresponding cell voltage and ph value in anodic chamber was 3 4 v and 1 7 fig s3 respectively as comparison ph value of cathode chamber using a piece of pem corresponded to ph 11 this result illustrated two points firstly the amount of produced ohˉ exceeded the requirement for forming scale crystals and secondly the cheap nylon nets may replace the expensive pem in terms of creating an alkaline region the hardness residual after 30 min of reaction using nylon nets was shown in fig 3b if without any nylon net the total hardness dropped from initial 500 0 mg l to 350 0 mg l at the 30th minute when using single layer nylon net with 40 200 meshes the residual hardness did not change significantly once 400 mesh nylon net was used calcium hardness declined dramatically with increasing layer number of 400 mesh nylon nets the calcium hardness keeps decreasing as for magnesium hardness the obvious drop occurred when using 3 layers of nylon nets for both calcium hardness and magnesium hardness the decrease for 9 layers of nylon nets became very slight compared with that for 7 layers of nylon nets fig s4 it indicated that there was no need to add more layers the hardness removal using 7 layer 400 mesh nylon nets was superior to that using pem combined with ph change and hardness removal we confirmed that ohˉ accumulation was the prerequisite for efficient hardness removal the hardness removal involved two ways heterogeneous nucleation on the electrode surface and homogeneous nucleation in solution sequentially subtracting the weight of scale crystals belonging to heterogeneous nucleation from the total hardness removal may get the weight of scale crystals corresponding to homogeneous nucleation in order to obtain the weight of scale crystal from heterogeneous nucleation we weighed the cathode before and after use in 30 min reaction and weight differences were displayed in fig s3a for the following condition without nylon nets using 7 layers of 400 mesh nylon nets and using pem the weight difference was 26 6 mg 18 5 mg and 27 5 mg respectively we divided the total hardness removal by this weight difference to get the ratio of heterogeneous nucleation then the ratio of homogeneous nucleation was calculated by subtracting the ratio of heterogeneous nucleation from 100 the ratio of homogeneous nucleation for using 7 layers of 400 mesh nylon nets was 83 7 which was far higher than that for without nylon net 40 5 and using pem 77 5 and the detailed calculation process of homogeneous nucleation ratio was shown in table s1 the calculated results showed that the lsi value of the inflow was 1 3888 and the solution in this state had the potential to form scale after 30 min of reaction the lsi value of the solution increased to 3 7878 the calculation formula was shown in supporting information an increase in the saturation index meant that scales were more likely to appear in solution which promoted the occurrence of homogeneous nucleation as a result electrode continuous working hours would be effectively prolonged in a sequential batch reactor the driving force for ohˉ diffusion to build a large range of alkaline regions is the movement of h2 bubbles produced by water reduction the current density determines the size and number of h2 bubbles and then affects their movement feature with the increase of the current the efficiency of h2 evolution from the electrode would be improved resulting in the increase of h2 bubbles but the bubble size does not change chen et al 1992 under various current densities ph values of the cathode chamber were tested and the results were shown in fig 4 a as the current density increased from 1 ma cm2 to 15 ma cm2 ph values enhanced distinctly during the whole reaction process it proved that current density played an important role in forming ohˉ region it was worth noting that with the same current increment the largest ph increase appeared when current density enhanced from 1 ma cm2 to 3 ma cm2 fig 4b displayed the total hardness under various current densities during 30 min of reaction it revealed the similar tendency to fig 4a with the increased of current density the hardness residual decreased rapidly and then slowly the most significant difference also occurred when current density increased from 1 ma cm2 to 3 ma cm2 after 30 min of reaction the hardness residual under 3 ma cm2 was 63 1 mg l which was close to those under higher current densities 42 5 53 3 mg l compared with other current densities 3 ma cm2 corresponded higher current efficiency 39 0 fig s5 and lower energy consumption 3 3 kw h kg caco3 fig s6 these results indicated 3 ma cm2 was optimal another key factor affecting movement of h2 bubbles is mesh electrode structure especially the mesh number h2 bubbles produced by mesh electrodes are smaller compared to flat electrodes and because the surface of the mesh wires has a certain curvature the h2 bubbles are more likely to escape from the electrode surface sakai et al 2008 the performance of cathodes with different meshes in electrochemical softening was investigated and the results were showed in fig 5 a a plate cathode commonly used for practical electrochemical softening was used as a control after reaction for 30 min the effluent hardness was 411 8 mg l and the corresponding hardness removal was only 17 6 when using mesh cathodes the effluent hardness after 30 min reaction was significantly lower than that of the plate cathode the smaller mesh number brought the lower effluent hardness for instance the effluent hardness and the hardness removal rate of 10 mesh cathode was 55 3 mg l and 88 9 respectively it indicated the movement of h2 bubbles was benefited from small mesh number or large pore size the mesh number of cathodes also affected ph values in cathodic chamber and weight increments of cathodes although the performance of these mesh cathodes in hardness removal was similar their weight gain after softening reaction had a remarkable difference as fig 5b displayed for all mesh cathodes ph values in cathodic chamber were higher than 11 2 after 30 min of reaction the 10 mesh cathode produced the highest ph 11 8 in cathodic chamber naturally the weight increment for 10 mesh cathode was minimum only 7 7 mg and the corresponding homogeneous nucleation ratio was 92 5 which was much higher than that for plate cathode 22 2 it indicated the nucleation occurred mainly in the solution rather than on the cathode surface in addition the 10 mesh cathode was repeatedly used for 30 times for simulated ccw with initial total hardness of 500 0 mg l the effluent hardness fluctuated in the range of 32 8 72 0 mg l fig s7 which proved good stability of this mesh cathode in order to visually check the achievement of regulating the spatial distribution of ohˉ ph value in cathodic chamber was monitored by using thymolphthalein as ph indicator when ph was gradually increased beyond 9 4 the solution containing thymolphthalein would change from colorless to blue as fig 6 a shown for nylon nets free reactor with plate cathode and mesh anode solution near both side of cathode turned blue gradually before the 3rd minute and then the blue faded it was explained that h produced on anodic surface may diffuse to cathode to neutralize ohˉ after installing nylon nets between plate cathode and mesh anode the color in anode side did not change but blue region near left side of cathode expanded and filled the entire cathodic chamber after 24 min fig 6b obviously nylon nets blocked h diffusing into cathode chamber the result for mesh cathode nylon nets mesh anode was exhibited in fig 6c the obvious distinguish with the situation in fig 6b was that h2 bubbles were larger in number and smaller in size and they moved to upper left of the reactor reached liquid level and diffused downward quickly filling the cathode chamber in 2 min from the 2nd minute to the 30th minute cathodic chamber was getting bluer and bluer indicating the accumulation of ohˉ when nylon nets were pulled out h2 bubbles increased in size and decreased in number although the blue region still filled cathodic chamber within 3 min it faded before the 5th minute fig 6d the function of nylon nets in inhibiting neutralization reaction was further confirmed these monitoring results supported that both nylon nets and mesh cathode were necessary for rapid forming alkaline region 3 2 regulation of retention time after ohˉ generated from electrochemical process the hardness removal in solution was conducted through chemical process including homogeneous nucleation crystal growth and precipitation separation it took a long time for crystal nucleus to grow up to the size for spontaneous gravity precipitation legitimately compared with the gravity precipitation membrane separation which was carried out immediately after crystal nucleus grew just larger than membrane pore may shorten water softening duration in order to select the separation membrane that matched with the crystal growth time the key was to monitor the size of crystals during growth process in order to preliminarily understand the relationship between retention time and nucleus size turbidity was monitored firstly as fig 7 a displayed when the current density was 3 ma cm2 in the first ten minutes the turbidity slowly increased to 8 9 ntu while in the second ten minutes it rose sharply to 190 6 ntu then it continued to fall until the reaction was terminated at the 120th minute and the turbidity change during the reactions was investigated under other current densities as fig s8 displayed all curves showed the form of first rising and then falling and the higher the current density applied the earlier the peak occurred and the smaller the stable value was when the current density was 7 15 ma cm2 the turbidity reached its maximum value in 3 10 min and the stable value appeared at the 5 15 min particle samples at turbidity turning points under the 3 ma cm2 were collected to observe morphology and size 2 ml of water sample was taken from the cathode chamber at a certain interval then we separated particles from water by polyethersulfone membrane the average diameter of membrane pores was 0 22 μm thus the size and number of scale particles can be directly observed their sem images were shown in fig 7b f when retention time was 1 min sem image showed dispersed nanorods with 200 nm in diameter and 200 600 nm in length it was a typical aragonite caco3 configuration carré et al 2020 after 2 5 min of reaction nanorods aggregated into large particles whose diameter and length were 500 nm and over 1 μm respectively when the reaction time was extended to 10 min average diameter and length of particles grew to 2 μm and 5 μm respectively with prolonging reaction time the size of the particles increased slightly when the reaction time increased to 20 min fig 7e the size of the scale particles did not change much but the number of scale particles increased significantly and at the 30th minute the number of particles decreased slightly fig 7f which was consistent with the turbidity change of the solution fig 7a especially two dimensional sheet structures appeared in sem image for 20 min of reaction which was attributed to brucite of mg oh 2 carré et al 2020 in addition eds analysis of the particles at 20th minute proved that the main elements were ca and mg fig s9 and three crystal types of caco3 calcite caco3 aragonite and mg oh 2 brucite were determined by xrd analysis fig s10 as a comparison the solution turbidity for ss plate cathode was always below 2 0 ntu indicating too few crystals nucleus in the solution in another words hardness was removed mainly by heterogeneous nucleation deposition on cathodic surface combining turbidity change fig s8 hardness removal fig 4 and sem images fig 7 the crystal growth process of homogeneous nucleation was described as follows for low current densities 3 ma cm2 in this study hardness removal was maintained at a relatively constant rate but the turbidity change was divided in three stages in the initial stage the turbidity was very low it was because most of the crystal nucleuses were too small to be identified by the turbidity meter in the second stage turbidity increased sharply during this stage crystal nucleus gathered grew up and reached a recognizable size in the third stage the crystal size was large enough to begin gravitational settling and separation from the solution so turbidity began to decline rapidly for middle current densities 5 and 7 ma cm2 in this study the hardness change was divided in two stages rapidly declined and then slowly declined until being stable while the turbidity change was similar to that under low current densities and there were still three distinct stages for high current densities 9 15 ma cm2 in this study the hardness change was similar to that under moderate current densities while the turbidity curves displayed only two stages rose rapidly and declined slowly until being stable compared with that under low current densities the immediate appearance of the turbidity at the beginning of the reaction indicated that the crystal growth was rapid under the high current densities this benefited from a high density of crystal nuclei which can be supported by rapid hardness removal and physical pictures of the solution in 30 min of electrochemical cell with ss mesh cathode nylon nets and ss plate cathode were shown in fig s11 the proposed crystal growth process suggested that crystal nucleus would be larger than 500 nm in several minutes at this point scale crystals may be separated from water by a membrane with a pore size less than 500 nm for example when the current density was 3 ma cm2 the diameter of scale particles in the solution stabilized between 2 5 μm after 20 min of reaction and the corresponding solution turbidity also increased to 190 6 ntu fig 7 in the original manuscript in order to obtain clear effluent the solution with a turbidity of 190 6 ntu was placed in a glass bottle for 19 h before the turbidity value dropped below 0 5 ntu fig s12 under the same experimental conditions the addition of a membrane module pore size less than 500 nm after the electrochemical reduction allowed an effective separation of the scale particles from the solution fig s13 thus the time consumed by crystal growth was avoided in this way the residence time will be significantly shortened which will bring high flux and low energy consumption therefore a continuous flowing process was designed which added the membrane module after the electrochemical reduction fig 2 when retention time was 2 5 min and current density was 3 ma cm2 total hardness of effluent stabilized from 500 0 mg l to 415 0 mg l fig 8 a the corresponding energy consumption and precipitation rate were 1 4 kw h kg caco3 and 70 9 g hˑm2 fig 8b respectively which had great advantages compared with reported literatures table 1 in order to better understand the characteristics of continuous flowing process retention time was fixed at 2 5 min and softening performance energy consumption and precipitation rate under different current densities were investigated as shown in fig 8a with increase of current density ca2 hardness of effluent was removed obviously and gradually decreased from 274 2 mg l to 34 2 mg l but mg2 hardness in effluent 200 0 mg l did not remove at all in the current density range of 1 to 12 ma cm2 until the current density increased to 21 ma cm2 mg2 hardness in effluent decreased from 200 0 mg l to 87 5 mg l this difference between ca2 and mg2 hardness removal had a direct relationship with the ph value when current density was less than 12 ma cm2 ph value of simulated ccw was less than 10 3 which was sufficient for the rapid removal of ca2 ions but not for mg2 ions it also indicated that continuous flowing process can remove ca2 and mg2 ions separately by controlling solution ph increasing the current density to 21 ma cm2 may increase the precipitation ratio to 317 8 g hˑm2 however the voltage was high 7 0 v which led to high energy consumption 4 6 kw h kg caco3 low current efficiency 52 6 therefore a current density of 12 ma cm2 was considered to be the best choice for continuous flowing experiments with 2 5 min of retention time table 2 showed softening performance energy consumption and precipitation rate of continuous flowing experiment under different retention times at 12 ma cm2 as retention time decreased from 20 to 1 5 min energy consumption decreased from 12 6 kw h kg caco3 to 2 1 kw h kg caco3 and precipitation ratio increased from 48 0 g hˑm2 to 290 8 g hˑm2 moreover turbidity of the effluent may be kept below 1 0 ntu after membrane separation in addition scale on membrane surface may be removed by physical scratching fig s14 easily moreover on an industrial scale considering that crystallization will continue to occur on the microfiltration membrane surface such cleaning should be carried out almost continuously to avoid cementation of sediments the combination of electrochemical softening and membrane separation reduced the reaction time thus fundamentally improved the overall softening efficiency and high flux capacity 3 3 mechanism of strengthening homogeneous nucleation nylon net is made of polypropylene fiber which has the characteristics of high strength good elasticity wear and corrosion resistance therefore nylon net is widely used as filtration material in chemical and environmental protection industries and nylon net is a non selective separation material that is hydrophilic after a period of immersion in solution and ensures the exchange of solution between the cathode and anode chambers in this work the transfer of bubbles was used to drive the diffusion of ohˉ from the cathode surface to the bulk solution which increased the proportion of scale particles deposited in the bulk solution according to the literature an average diameter of hydrogen bubbles from cathodes was 3 5 μm while that of oxygen bubbles from anodes was 53 4 μm chen et al 1992 sem images showed the mesh size of 400 mesh nylon net was about 25 0 μm fig s15 which may effectively block the transfer of oxygen bubbles but allow the transfer of hydrogen bubbles obviously due to the unidirectional movement of bubbles the h diffusion from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber was prevented as a result the stability of the alkaline region was maintained on basis of the experimental results a process mechanism for strengthening homogeneous nucleation was proposed the sandwich electrode module divided the reactor into cathodic chamber and anodic chamber 7 layers of 400 mesh nylon nets were placed between mesh cathode and mesh anode this specific structure may prevent as much as possible not only h transfer from anodic chamber to cathodic chamber but also ohˉ transfer from cathodic chamber to anodic chamber sequentially ohˉ concentration in cathodic chamber may be accumulated rapidly furthermore with the appropriate meshes of cathode and the proper applied current h2 bubbles generated by water electrolysis pushed ohˉ anions away from the cathodic surface and mixed them well with water then forming a strong alkaline region in cathode chamber these ohˉ anions may react with hco3 to produce co3 2 which then reacted with ca2 to generate caco3 because the solution was highly supersaturated the homogeneous nucleation process dominated and eventually led to scale deposition in the bulk solution there were four steps in the process of caco3 scale formation in the solution solution supersaturation crystal nucleation crystal growth and scale formation when ca2 co3 2ˉ ksp caco3 nucleation of caco3 crystals may precipitate in the supersaturated solution the emerged crystals nucleation provided the required growth sites for the crystals to grow as residence time prolonged little crystal nucleuses gradually aggregated and grew as soon as their sizes exceed those of membrane pores soft water may be gathered from effluent it is because of the increase of homogeneous nucleation ratio and the shortening of crystal growth time that the scale deposition on the electrode surface is significantly inhibited 4 conclusion a sandwich electrode module was first proposed for electrochemical softening which may strengthen homogeneous nucleation by spatial and temporal regulation of alkaline region the high curvature surface of metal wires in mesh cathode may facilitate bubbles off and drive ohˉ diffusing to the bulk solution and nylon nets may block effectively the transfer of oxygen bubbles and h to the cathode chamber thus ensuring the alkaline region in cathode chamber then the combination of electrochemical reduction and membrane separation was designed which may minimize the time to wait for the crystal to grow by matching crystal diameters and membrane pores in this way the energy consumption and hardness removal of electrochemical softening were improved remarkably this new electrode module and its working mechanism are expected to promote the practical application of electrochemical softening technology

of petroleum and petrochemicals dalian 116045 china electrochemical softening is an effective technology for the treatment of circulating cooling water but its hardness removal efficiency is limited because that nucleation and growth of scale crystals depended on cathode surface in this study a novel method was proposed to break through this limit via spatiotemporal management of nucleation and growth processes a cube reactor was divided into cathodic chamber and anodic chamber via installing a sandwich structure module composed of mesh cathode nylon nets and mesh anode using this continuous flowing electrochemical reactor oh generated by water electrolysis was rapidly pushed away from cathode surface by water flow and hydrogen bubbles movement as a result a wide range of strongly alkaline regions was rapidly constructed in cathodic chamber to play a nucleation region and homogeneous nucleation in liquid phase replaced heterogeneous nucleation on cathodic surface furthermore the growth process of scale crystals in alkaline regions was monitored in situ it took only 150 s of residence time to grow to 500 nm which may be easily separated from water by a microfiltration membrane with this new method the precipitation rate was 290 8 g hˑm2 and corresponding energy consumption was 2 1 kw h kg caco3 both were superior to those reported values therefore this study developed an efficient electrochemical softening method by spatial and temporal regulation of homogeneous nucleation and crystal growth processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water softening electrochemistry alkaline region homogeneous nucleation crystal growth data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cooling water is a necessary heat transfer medium in equipment manufacturing thermoelectric metallurgy petrochemical and coal chemical industries its consumption account is more than 60 of total industrial water wu et al 2009 therefore cyclic utilization is necessary to save water resources evaporation loss will continuously increase ion concentration of circulating cooling water ccw then caco3 and other substances with high thermal resistance precipitate on the surface of heat exchangers or pipelines resulting in decline of heat exchange efficiency pipeline blockage and corrosion brastad and he 2013 jiang et al 2015 zarga et al 2013 strategies involved scale inhibition and softening as typical scale inhibition technologies scale inhibitor and magnetization only delay scaling but not remove ca2 from ccw due to ion accumulation during recycling process high hardness water has to be discharged dirany et al 2016 zhu et al 2021 the softening techniques such as reverse osmosis freire gormaly and bilton 2019 electrodialysis han 2022 and ion exchange comstock and boyer 2014 are troubled by membrane fouling or exchange capacity declining sohn et al 2005 macadam and parsons 2004 chemical softening is the most commonly used method in ccw treatment hori et al 2021 during chemical softening naoh is added into ccw to provide ohˉ which may react with hco3 and ca2 to form caco3 with ph value increasing to 9 6 caco3 nucleation will accelerate and then crystal nucleus gather and grow until large enough to be separated from ccw via gravitational sedimentation de lannoy et al 2018 sharifian et al 2022 this method is widely used because it can actually remove the scaling ions and does not use membrane or resins as an upgraded version of chemical softening electrochemical softening produce ohˉ in situ by water reduction reaction on cathodic surface carré et al 2020 xu et al 2020 the tedious processes of transporting storing and adding naoh are avoided and oh concentration may be precisely regulated due to obvious operation and cost advantages commercial electrochemical softening equipment has emerged zhang et al 2020 in electrochemical water softening process because ohˉ anions are formed on cathodic surface caco3 crystals nucleate accumulate and grow on cathodic surface it leads to a general belief that electrochemical softening depends on heterogeneous nucleation emmel et al 2022 and has a spatial constraint adjacent to cathodic surface consequently most published papers have focused on increasing the effective cathodic area the typical large surface area cathodes involve mesh cathode li et al 2020 luan et al 2019 porous cathode rinat et al 2005 stainless steel wool cathode sanjuán et al 2019 and so on indeed the enhanced cathodic area improve effectively hardness removal efficiency to 29 16 g hˑm2 and significantly reduce energy consumption to 6 0 kw h kg caco3 luan et al 2019 however insulating caco3 layer deposited on cathodic surface leads to increase of resistance which hinders electrochemical generation of ohˉ in order to ensure the effectiveness of electrochemical softening the scale layer covering cathodic surface has to be removed by polarity reversal jin et al 2021 mechanical scraping krzyzanowski et al 2003 and ultrasonic cleaning qu et al 2020 reluctantly softening process has to be interrupted during descaling and regeneration of cathodes to break through spatial constraints of scaling on cathodic surface some recent papers have made a useful exploration a piece of porous carbon fiber felt was placed in front of cathode to provide additional effective area for nucleus aggregation and growth which may prevent the electromigration of ca2 to cathode and reduce scaling on cathode surface yang et al 2022 in a new seed system alkaline solution were produced via electrolyzing soft water then poured into a crystallizer where caco3 crystal seeds were preplaced to assist nucleation and growth because electrochemical reaction is separated from nucleation and growth processes cathode scaling may be completely avoided this method displayed a high precipitation rate of 300 g hˑm2 and energy consumption was only 4 6 kw h kg caco3 hasson et al 2010 the softening performance of this seed system can be further improved by using bipolar film with hardness removal efficiency up to 630 g hˑm2 and energy consumption as low as 1 2 kw h kg caco3 zaslavschi et al 2013 although these methods effectively improve softening capacity the essence is still heterogeneous nucleation and softening performance is limited by effective crystallization area if nucleation occurs in solution rather than solid surface the spatial constraints may be eliminated thoroughly in fact the above mentioned chemical softening follows homogeneous nucleation in liquid phase however after homogeneous nucleation crystals need relatively long time to grow large enough for spontaneous precipitation the solid liquid separation technology can effectively avoid the time consumed by crystals growth which may obviously reduce both energy consumption and reactor volume recently jiang et al reported an energetic improvement to shorten the time waiting for growth of crystals liu et al 2022 they used ti tubular microfilter to separate caco3 after crystal diameter close to 0 15 mm which was far below that would precipitate spontaneously thereby its descaling efficiency and energy consumption were 348 8 g caco3 hˑm2 and 1 88 kw h kg caco3 respectively these values were already at the outstanding level in the literatures however it still takes a relatively long time from just nucleation to growth to 0 15 mm in size based on the above analysis both spatial and temporal constraints are the difficulty of electrochemical method in ccw softening from the spatial perspective ca2 and hco3ˉ required in the nucleation process are dissolved and ubiquitous in ccw and ohˉ becomes the key factor for determining the nucleation position as long as ohˉ produced on cathode surface is quickly migrated to bulk ccw and accumulates to a certain concentration bulk ccw will become the nucleation region instead of solid surface such as electrode fence seed etc breaking the location limit from the temporal perspective the emigration of ca2 from liquid phase to solid phase is completed by caco3 nucleation following by aggregation and growth of crystal nucleus and separation from ccw this is a time consuming process if separation of scale crystals from water is performed as soon as crystal size exceeds the diameter of membrane pores waiting time for crystals to grow will be saved herein an electrochemical system of expanding homogeneous nucleation region and reducing crystal growth during was proposed and its performance in spatial and temporal regulation of homogeneous nucleation and crystal growth was verified it opens up a new route for electrochemical water softening to improve efficiency and save energy 2 experimental section 2 1 electrode module and reactor as shown in fig 1 an electrode module with sandwich structure was composed of mesh cathode insulated nylon nets and mesh anode the cathode was made by several stainless steel ss meshes and the size for one piece of ss mesh was 100 0 mm 100 0 mm 0 3 mm the anode was ruo2 iro2 tio2 coated ti mesh 100 0 mm 100 0 mm 1 0 mm seven pieces of nylon net 400 mesh were insert the gap 2 0 mm between two electrodes the thickness of each nylon net was 0 1 mm this electrode module was installed into a cube reactor and divided the reactor into a cathode chamber 350 ml and an anode chamber 50 ml 2 2 electrochemical softening experiments simulated ccw was prepared using ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm including cacl2 3 0 mmol l mgcl2 2 0 mmol l nahco3 6 0 mmol l and na2so4 0 05 mol l the total hardness in caco3 was 500 0 mg l including 300 0 mg l of calcium hardness and 200 0 mg l of magnesium hardness the initial alkalinity ph and conductivity of simulated ccw was 6 0 mmol l 8 1 and 8000 0 μs cm respectively a direct current power supply ps 3010d ⅱ output current 0 10 a was employed to provide constant current for sequencing batch experiments magnetic stirring in cathode chamber was set at 500 rpm during the electrochemical softening process ph value in cathodic chamber was monitored in situ with a ph meter phs 3e shanghai china water samples were taken at a certain interval filtered via polyethersulfone membrane pes 0 22 μm of porous diameter and then tested hardness for calculating the weight of scale deposited on cathodic surface stainless steel meshes before and after used were weighed after drying in an oven under 80 c for 10 min for continuous flowing experiment fig 2 simulated ccw flowed parallelly to the cathode surface through the cathode chamber and then entered a separator where solid liquid separation was accomplished by microfiltration membrane ph monitoring and hardness testing were same as those of sequential batch experiments 2 3 analysis the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 were measured using edta titration chinese standards gb t 15 452 2009 the alkalinity was detected by indicator titration chinese standards gb t 15 451 2006 the conductivity was measured by multi parameter water quality detector multi 3430 beijing china the turbidity was tested by turbidimeter wgz 200 shanghai china the size and microstructure of scale

smartlab 9kw japan the test method for co3 2ˉ was shown in supporting information 2 4 calculation energy consumption ec kw h kg caco3 is calculated with the following eq 1 1 e c u i t c 0 c t v 10 3

current efficiency and homogeneous nucleation ratio were listed in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 regulation of alkaline region the key to strengthen homogeneous nucleation and suppress heterogeneous nucleation is to generate a large range of ohˉ regions ohˉ anions are produced from water reduction at cathodes as the equation h2o 2e h2 2 ohˉ if without any intervention most of ohˉ anions will be neutralized by h cations which are the product of anodic reaction the usual approach to prevent neutralization is to set up a proton exchange membrane pem between cathode and anode in this study several layers of nylon nets were used to block the movement of bubbles and then weaken the ion diffusion between the cathode chamber and the anode chamber as fig 3 a displayed no matter how many mesh nylon nets were used ph value in cathode region rises rapidly to 9 from 0 min to 5 min after 5 min of reaction nylon nets with different meshes brought distinguishing ph tendency for 100 mesh and 200 mesh nylon nets ph values in cathode chamber fluctuated at 9 5 and the corresponding ph of the anode chamber gradually decreased with the reaction time and dropped to around 2 5 at the 30th minute fig s1 it meant that there was a balance between the production of ohˉ via water electrolysis and the consumption by forming scale crystals in addition some ohˉ passed through nylon nets to the anode chamber with the movement of hydrogen bubbles which weakened the interference of h on the alkaline region of the cathode chamber while the diffusion of ohˉ to anode chamber was slight and may be ignored when the nylon nets structure was 400 mesh 7 layers fig s2 for nylon nets with larger holes 40 mesh or no nylon net ph value dropped below 9 at the 30th minute while for 400 mesh nylon net ph value increased with the reaction time moreover the increment is positively correlated with layer number of nylon nets taking 7 layers of 400 mesh nylon nets as an example ph value of cathode chamber reached 11 5 after 30 min of reaction and the corresponding cell voltage and ph value in anodic chamber was 3 4 v and 1 7 fig s3 respectively as comparison ph value of cathode chamber using a piece of pem corresponded to ph 11 this result illustrated two points firstly the amount of produced ohˉ exceeded the requirement for forming scale crystals and secondly the cheap nylon nets may replace the expensive pem in terms of creating an alkaline region the hardness residual after 30 min of reaction using nylon nets was shown in fig 3b if without any nylon net the total hardness dropped from initial 500 0 mg l to 350 0 mg l at the 30th minute when using single layer nylon net with 40 200 meshes the residual hardness did not change significantly once 400 mesh nylon net was used calcium hardness declined dramatically with increasing layer number of 400 mesh nylon nets the calcium hardness keeps decreasing as for magnesium hardness the obvious drop occurred when using 3 layers of nylon nets for both calcium hardness and magnesium hardness the decrease for 9 layers of nylon nets became very slight compared with that for 7 layers of nylon nets fig s4 it indicated that there was no need to add more layers the hardness removal using 7 layer 400 mesh nylon nets was superior to that using pem combined with ph change and hardness removal we confirmed that ohˉ accumulation was the prerequisite for efficient hardness removal the hardness removal involved two ways heterogeneous nucleation on the electrode surface and homogeneous nucleation in solution sequentially subtracting the weight of scale crystals belonging to heterogeneous nucleation from the total hardness removal may get the weight of scale crystals corresponding to homogeneous nucleation in order to obtain the weight of scale crystal from heterogeneous nucleation we weighed the cathode before and after use in 30 min reaction and weight differences were displayed in fig s3a for the following condition without nylon nets using 7 layers of 400 mesh nylon nets and using pem the weight difference was 26 6 mg 18 5 mg and 27 5 mg respectively we divided the total hardness removal by this weight difference to get the ratio of heterogeneous nucleation then the ratio of homogeneous nucleation was calculated by subtracting the ratio of heterogeneous nucleation from 100 the ratio of homogeneous nucleation for using 7 layers of 400 mesh nylon nets was 83 7 which was far higher than that for without nylon net 40 5 and using pem 77 5 and the detailed calculation process of homogeneous nucleation ratio was shown in table s1 the calculated results showed that the lsi value of the inflow was 1 3888 and the solution in this state had the potential to form scale after 30 min of reaction the lsi value of the solution increased to 3 7878 the calculation formula was shown in supporting information an increase in the saturation index meant that scales were more likely to appear in solution which promoted the occurrence of homogeneous nucleation as a result electrode continuous working hours would be effectively prolonged in a sequential batch reactor the driving force for ohˉ diffusion to build a large range of alkaline regions is the movement of h2 bubbles produced by water reduction the current density determines the size and number of h2 bubbles and then affects their movement feature with the increase of the current the efficiency of h2 evolution from the electrode would be improved resulting in the increase of h2 bubbles but the bubble size does not change chen et al 1992 under various current densities ph values of the cathode chamber were tested and the results were shown in fig 4 a as the current density increased from 1 ma cm2 to 15 ma cm2 ph values enhanced distinctly during the whole reaction process it proved that current density played an important role in forming ohˉ region it was worth noting that with the same current increment the largest ph increase appeared when current density enhanced from 1 ma cm2 to 3 ma cm2 fig 4b displayed the total hardness under various current densities during 30 min of reaction it revealed the similar tendency to fig 4a with the increased of current density the hardness residual decreased rapidly and then slowly the most significant difference also occurred when current density increased from 1 ma cm2 to 3 ma cm2 after 30 min of reaction the hardness residual under 3 ma cm2 was 63 1 mg l which was close to those under higher current densities 42 5 53 3 mg l compared with other current densities 3 ma cm2 corresponded higher current efficiency 39 0 fig s5 and lower energy consumption 3 3 kw h kg caco3 fig s6 these results indicated 3 ma cm2 was optimal another key factor affecting movement of h2 bubbles is mesh electrode structure especially the mesh number h2 bubbles produced by mesh electrodes are smaller compared to flat electrodes and because the surface of the mesh wires has a certain curvature the h2 bubbles are more likely to escape from the electrode surface sakai et al 2008 the performance of cathodes with different meshes in electrochemical softening was investigated and the results were showed in fig 5 a a plate cathode commonly used for practical electrochemical softening was used as a control after reaction for 30 min the effluent hardness was 411 8 mg l and the corresponding hardness removal was only 17 6 when using mesh cathodes the effluent hardness after 30 min reaction was significantly lower than that of the plate cathode the smaller mesh number brought the lower effluent hardness for instance the effluent hardness and the hardness removal rate of 10 mesh cathode was 55 3 mg l and 88 9 respectively it indicated the movement of h2 bubbles was benefited from small mesh number or large pore size the mesh number of cathodes also affected ph values in cathodic chamber and weight increments of cathodes although the performance of these mesh cathodes in hardness removal was similar their weight gain after softening reaction had a remarkable difference as fig 5b displayed for all mesh cathodes ph values in cathodic chamber were higher than 11 2 after 30 min of reaction the 10 mesh cathode produced the highest ph 11 8 in cathodic chamber naturally the weight increment for 10 mesh cathode was minimum only 7 7 mg and the corresponding homogeneous nucleation ratio was 92 5 which was much higher than that for plate cathode 22 2 it indicated the nucleation occurred mainly in the solution rather than on the cathode surface in addition the 10 mesh cathode was repeatedly used for 30 times for simulated ccw with initial total hardness of 500 0 mg l the effluent hardness fluctuated in the range of 32 8 72 0 mg l fig s7 which proved good stability of this mesh cathode in order to visually check the achievement of regulating the spatial distribution of ohˉ ph value in cathodic chamber was monitored by using thymolphthalein as ph indicator when ph was gradually increased beyond 9 4 the solution containing thymolphthalein would change from colorless to blue as fig 6 a shown for nylon nets free reactor with plate cathode and mesh anode solution near both side of cathode turned blue gradually before the 3rd minute and then the blue faded it was explained that h produced on anodic surface may diffuse to cathode to neutralize ohˉ after installing nylon nets between plate cathode and mesh anode the color in anode side did not change but blue region near left side of cathode expanded and filled the entire cathodic chamber after 24 min fig 6b obviously nylon nets blocked h diffusing into cathode chamber the result for mesh cathode nylon nets mesh anode was exhibited in fig 6c the obvious distinguish with the situation in fig 6b was that h2 bubbles were larger in number and smaller in size and they moved to upper left of the reactor reached liquid level and diffused downward quickly filling the cathode chamber in 2 min from the 2nd minute to the 30th minute cathodic chamber was getting bluer and bluer indicating the accumulation of ohˉ when nylon nets were pulled out h2 bubbles increased in size and decreased in number although the blue region still filled cathodic chamber within 3 min it faded before the 5th minute fig 6d the function of nylon nets in inhibiting neutralization reaction was further confirmed these monitoring results supported that both nylon nets and mesh cathode were necessary for rapid forming alkaline region 3 2 regulation of retention time after ohˉ generated from electrochemical process the hardness removal in solution was conducted through chemical process including homogeneous nucleation crystal growth and precipitation separation it took a long time for crystal nucleus to grow up to the size for spontaneous gravity precipitation legitimately compared with the gravity precipitation membrane separation which was carried out immediately after crystal nucleus grew just larger than membrane pore may shorten water softening duration in order to select the separation membrane that matched with the crystal growth time the key was to monitor the size of crystals during growth process in order to preliminarily understand the relationship between retention time and nucleus size turbidity was monitored firstly as fig 7 a displayed when the current density was 3 ma cm2 in the first ten minutes the turbidity slowly increased to 8 9 ntu while in the second ten minutes it rose sharply to 190 6 ntu then it continued to fall until the reaction was terminated at the 120th minute and the turbidity change during the reactions was investigated under other current densities as fig s8 displayed all curves showed the form of first rising and then falling and the higher the current density applied the earlier the peak occurred and the smaller the stable value was when the current density was 7 15 ma cm2 the turbidity reached its maximum value in 3 10 min and the stable value appeared at the 5 15 min particle samples at turbidity turning points under the 3 ma cm2 were collected to observe morphology and size 2 ml of water sample was taken from the cathode chamber at a certain interval then we separated particles from water by polyethersulfone membrane the average diameter of membrane pores was 0 22 μm thus the size and number of scale particles can be directly observed their sem images were shown in fig 7b f when retention time was 1 min sem image showed dispersed nanorods with 200 nm in diameter and 200 600 nm in length it was a typical aragonite caco3 configuration carré et al 2020 after 2 5 min of reaction nanorods aggregated into large particles whose diameter and length were 500 nm and over 1 μm respectively when the reaction time was extended to 10 min average diameter and length of particles grew to 2 μm and 5 μm respectively with prolonging reaction time the size of the particles increased slightly when the reaction time increased to 20 min fig 7e the size of the scale particles did not change much but the number of scale particles increased significantly and at the 30th minute the number of particles decreased slightly fig 7f which was consistent with the turbidity change of the solution fig 7a especially two dimensional sheet structures appeared in sem image for 20 min of reaction which was attributed to brucite of mg oh 2 carré et al 2020 in addition eds analysis of the particles at 20th minute proved that the main elements were ca and mg fig s9 and three crystal types of caco3 calcite caco3 aragonite and mg oh 2 brucite were determined by xrd analysis fig s10 as a comparison the solution turbidity for ss plate cathode was always below 2 0 ntu indicating too few crystals nucleus in the solution in another words hardness was removed mainly by heterogeneous nucleation deposition on cathodic surface combining turbidity change fig s8 hardness removal fig 4 and sem images fig 7 the crystal growth process of homogeneous nucleation was described as follows for low current densities 3 ma cm2 in this study hardness removal was maintained at a relatively constant rate but the turbidity change was divided in three stages in the initial stage the turbidity was very low it was because most of the crystal nucleuses were too small to be identified by the turbidity meter in the second stage turbidity increased sharply during this stage crystal nucleus gathered grew up and reached a recognizable size in the third stage the crystal size was large enough to begin gravitational settling and separation from the solution so turbidity began to decline rapidly for middle current densities 5 and 7 ma cm2 in this study the hardness change was divided in two stages rapidly declined and then slowly declined until being stable while the turbidity change was similar to that under low current densities and there were still three distinct stages for high current densities 9 15 ma cm2 in this study the hardness change was similar to that under moderate current densities while the turbidity curves displayed only two stages rose rapidly and declined slowly until being stable compared with that under low current densities the immediate appearance of the turbidity at the beginning of the reaction indicated that the crystal growth was rapid under the high current densities this benefited from a high density of crystal nuclei which can be supported by rapid hardness removal and physical pictures of the solution in 30 min of electrochemical cell with ss mesh cathode nylon nets and ss plate cathode were shown in fig s11 the proposed crystal growth process suggested that crystal nucleus would be larger than 500 nm in several minutes at this point scale crystals may be separated from water by a membrane with a pore size less than 500 nm for example when the current density was 3 ma cm2 the diameter of scale particles in the solution stabilized between 2 5 μm after 20 min of reaction and the corresponding solution turbidity also increased to 190 6 ntu fig 7 in the original manuscript in order to obtain clear effluent the solution with a turbidity of 190 6 ntu was placed in a glass bottle for 19 h before the turbidity value dropped below 0 5 ntu fig s12 under the same experimental conditions the addition of a membrane module pore size less than 500 nm after the electrochemical reduction allowed an effective separation of the scale particles from the solution fig s13 thus the time consumed by crystal growth was avoided in this way the residence time will be significantly shortened which will bring high flux and low energy consumption therefore a continuous flowing process was designed which added the membrane module after the electrochemical reduction fig 2 when retention time was 2 5 min and current density was 3 ma cm2 total hardness of effluent stabilized from 500 0 mg l to 415 0 mg l fig 8 a the corresponding energy consumption and precipitation rate were 1 4 kw h kg caco3 and 70 9 g hˑm2 fig 8b respectively which had great advantages compared with reported literatures table 1 in order to better understand the characteristics of continuous flowing process retention time was fixed at 2 5 min and softening performance energy consumption and precipitation rate under different current densities were investigated as shown in fig 8a with increase of current density ca2 hardness of effluent was removed obviously and gradually decreased from 274 2 mg l to 34 2 mg l but mg2 hardness in effluent 200 0 mg l did not remove at all in the current density range of 1 to 12 ma cm2 until the current density increased to 21 ma cm2 mg2 hardness in effluent decreased from 200 0 mg l to 87 5 mg l this difference between ca2 and mg2 hardness removal had a direct relationship with the ph value when current density was less than 12 ma cm2 ph value of simulated ccw was less than 10 3 which was sufficient for the rapid removal of ca2 ions but not for mg2 ions it also indicated that continuous flowing process can remove ca2 and mg2 ions separately by controlling solution ph increasing the current density to 21 ma cm2 may increase the precipitation ratio to 317 8 g hˑm2 however the voltage was high 7 0 v which led to high energy consumption 4 6 kw h kg caco3 low current efficiency 52 6 therefore a current density of 12 ma cm2 was considered to be the best choice for continuous flowing experiments with 2 5 min of retention time table 2 showed softening performance energy consumption and precipitation rate of continuous flowing experiment under different retention times at 12 ma cm2 as retention time decreased from 20 to 1 5 min energy consumption decreased from 12 6 kw h kg caco3 to 2 1 kw h kg caco3 and precipitation ratio increased from 48 0 g hˑm2 to 290 8 g hˑm2 moreover turbidity of the effluent may be kept below 1 0 ntu after membrane separation in addition scale on membrane surface may be removed by physical scratching fig s14 easily moreover on an industrial scale considering that crystallization will continue to occur on the microfiltration membrane surface such cleaning should be carried out almost continuously to avoid cementation of sediments the combination of electrochemical softening and membrane separation reduced the reaction time thus fundamentally improved the overall softening efficiency and high flux capacity 3 3 mechanism of strengthening homogeneous nucleation nylon net is made of polypropylene fiber which has the characteristics of high strength good elasticity wear and corrosion resistance therefore nylon net is widely used as filtration material in chemical and environmental protection industries and nylon net is a non selective separation material that is hydrophilic after a period of immersion in solution and ensures the exchange of solution between the cathode and anode chambers in this work the transfer of bubbles was used to drive the diffusion of ohˉ from the cathode surface to the bulk solution which increased the proportion of scale particles deposited in the bulk solution according to the literature an average diameter of hydrogen bubbles from cathodes was 3 5 μm while that of oxygen bubbles from anodes was 53 4 μm chen et al 1992 sem images showed the mesh size of 400 mesh nylon net was about 25 0 μm fig s15 which may effectively block the transfer of oxygen bubbles but allow the transfer of hydrogen bubbles obviously due to the unidirectional movement of bubbles the h diffusion from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber was prevented as a result the stability of the alkaline region was maintained on basis of the experimental results a process mechanism for strengthening homogeneous nucleation was proposed the sandwich electrode module divided the reactor into cathodic chamber and anodic chamber 7 layers of 400 mesh nylon nets were placed between mesh cathode and mesh anode this specific structure may prevent as much as possible not only h transfer from anodic chamber to cathodic chamber but also ohˉ transfer from cathodic chamber to anodic chamber sequentially ohˉ concentration in cathodic chamber may be accumulated rapidly furthermore with the appropriate meshes of cathode and the proper applied current h2 bubbles generated by water electrolysis pushed ohˉ anions away from the cathodic surface and mixed them well with water then forming a strong alkaline region in cathode chamber these ohˉ anions may react with hco3 to produce co3 2 which then reacted with ca2 to generate caco3 because the solution was highly supersaturated the homogeneous nucleation process dominated and eventually led to scale deposition in the bulk solution there were four steps in the process of caco3 scale formation in the solution solution supersaturation crystal nucleation crystal growth and scale formation when ca2 co3 2ˉ ksp caco3 nucleation of caco3 crystals may precipitate in the supersaturated solution the emerged crystals nucleation provided the required growth sites for the crystals to grow as residence time prolonged little crystal nucleuses gradually aggregated and grew as soon as their sizes exceed those of membrane pores soft water may be gathered from effluent it is because of the increase of homogeneous nucleation ratio and the shortening of crystal growth time that the scale deposition on the electrode surface is significantly inhibited 4 conclusion a sandwich electrode module was first proposed for electrochemical softening which may strengthen homogeneous nucleation by spatial and temporal regulation of alkaline region the high curvature surface of metal wires in mesh cathode may facilitate bubbles off and drive ohˉ diffusing to the bulk solution and nylon nets may block effectively the transfer of oxygen bubbles and h to the cathode chamber thus ensuring the alkaline region in cathode chamber then the combination of electrochemical reduction and membrane separation was designed which may minimize the time to wait for the crystal to grow by matching crystal diameters and membrane pores in this way the energy consumption and hardness removal of electrochemical softening were improved remarkably this new electrode module and its working mechanism are expected to promote the practical application of electrochemical softening technology

15056,leakage of oils and organic solvents poses a significant threat to aquatic environments here low temperature carbonized aerogels with highly porous and anisotropic structures obtained only from biomass derived materials were proposed to absorb polymorphic oils from contaminated water specifically carbonized aerogels prepared at temperatures of 300 c and 350 c exhibited ultra high absorption capacities 40 125 g g 1 and oil water separation efficiencies 99 even in harsh environments which were attributed to their exceptional properties including high porosity abundant macropores excellent thermal stability and hydrophobicity through citric acid crosslinking and low temperature carbonization the aerogels exhibited superior compression elasticity and could be cyclically utilized through simple extrusion while realizing the recovery of oils moreover the outstanding photothermal conversion properties obtained through carbonization contributed to the high temperature and fluidity of the oils surrounding the aerogels which is crucial for improving the absorption performance of high viscosity oils such absorbent materials are used to separate crude oil from oil water mixtures which can achieve maximum absorption of 56 g g 1 and increase the absorption rate from several days to 10 min in a low temperature 4 c seawater environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polymorphic oil cleanup biomass based aerogels carbonization compression elasticity photothermal conversion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction frequent oil spills and chemical leakage have caused a series of environmental pollution and ecological problems that required urgent remediation chen et al 2019 therefore various technologies applied in the disposal of oil spills such as chemical treatment physical absorption in situ combustion and bioremediation have emerged deng et al 2020 physical absorption has attracted the most attention because of its low cost environmental friendliness high efficiency and ease of operation zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 for physical absorption multitudinous three dimensional 3d porous materials have been adopted as the absorbents including ultramicroporous metal organic frameworks gong et al 2022 rice husk derived biochar angelova et al 2011 powder wang et al 2021 and sponges wu et al 2020a zhao et al 2014 these materials exhibit desirable absorption performance and are convenient for large scale practical applications liu and qiu 2020 sponges composed of polyurethane pu and melamine have been widely used for oil water separation owing to their high porosity ultra low density and low cost das et al 2021 for example melamine sponge is a superb absorbent with an absorption capacity of up to 87 194 times its own weight wang et al 2019 a graphene pu sponge was shown to effectively separate oil water mixtures and surfactant stabilized emulsions with efficiencies of 99 99 and 99 91 respectively kong et al 2017 however the use of sponges and foams made of synthetic macromolecules carries the risk of secondary pollution owing to their refractory degradation yin et al 2020 biomass based aerogels with 3d variable networks are promising candidates because of their adjustable wettability and high porosity dilamian and noroozi 2021 compared to synthetic materials they are highly competitive because of their inherent advantages such as abundant sources ecological friendliness biodegradability and renewability to date various aerogels have been developed based on biomass materials including wood zhu et al 2019 cellulose feng et al 2015 lignin partow et al 2022 chitin huang et al 2021 and bamboo jiao et al 2016 long et al long et al 2021 prepared a carbonized aerogel from deep eutectic solvent modified cellulose nanofibers cnf which possessed a volume absorption capability of 74 95 for oils and organic pollutants the superhydrophobic carbon fiber aerogel obtained from direct pyrolysis of cotton has an absorption capacity of up to 50 200 g g 1 for various oil stains bi et al 2013 in aerogel preparation the pore structure is usually initially tuned to obtain a high absorption capacity and rapid absorption rate by nanofibrillating waste boxboard pulp and subsequently diluting the cnf suspension nanocellulose aerobeads exhibited ultralow density as low as 0 005 g cm 3 and high porosity 99 6 with a high absorption capacity of up to 279 g g 1 for castor oil karzar jeddi et al 2019 a wood based carbonized aerogel with a low curvature stacked laminate structure was created via delignification its absorption capacity for carbon tetrachloride is 21 times that of natural wood and the absorption equilibrium for peanut oil can reach tens of seconds wan et al 2019 cyclic utilization is a crucial consideration when evaluating oil absorbents recovery of absorbed oil by straightforward physical squeezing has gradually become a necessary feature of good absorbents which requires excellent mechanical strength and elasticity because of their inherent drawbacks including fragility and insufficient mechanical strength biomass derived absorbents must be modified to satisfy such demands dong et al dong et al 2021 used two dimensional reduced graphene oxide nanosheets to construct carbon layers and cellulose nanocrystals to form macroscopic wave carbon layers which also consisted of the prehydrolysis liquor as a tackifier the wavy layered structure contributed significantly to super compression withstanding 95 strains and super elasticity retention of approximately 100 after 500 cycles at 50 strain yi et al yi et al 2020 prepared chitosan aerogels with a spring like skeleton by controlling the vertical growth of the ice crystals this unique structure provided sufficient space for elastic deformation thereby maintaining an almost constant absorption efficiency over 10 cycles additionally after selective removal of hemicellulose and lignin wood is also commonly modified to serve as an absorbent with excellent compressive elasticity guan et al 2018 song et al 2017 and its wavy structure is often mimicked by various compressible non woody absorbents conventional absorbents are usually invalidated when treating polluted water containing high viscosity oils yu et al 2020 the critical reason is that poor fluidity increases the difficulty for high viscosity oils to diffuse into the pore structure resulting in a significant loss in the absorption rate and capacity kong et al 2022 in general high temperatures are beneficial for increasing the fluidity of heavy oils as a type of clean energy solar energy can be used as a heat source to heat the absorbent and surrounding oil thus reducing the oil viscosity for more effective cleaning singh and jelinek 2020 efficient capture of sunlight and rapid photothermal conversion can be achieved by adding photothermal materials such as carbon nanotubes zhu et al 2019 mxene zheng et al 2022 or reduced graphene oxide chao et al 2020 to aerogels the bottom temperature of 42 c could be achieved within 3 min when the lipophilic wood sponge was coated with ti3c2tx mxene nanosheets and the crude oil absorption rate increased by nearly 2 5 times via in situ auxiliary heating under sunlight illumination of 1 5 kw m 2 note that 1 kw m 2 1 sun therefore 1 kw m 2 is expressed as 1 sun in the following paragraphs wang et al 2022 a pomelo peel based photothermal sponge decorated with polypyrrole reached a temperature of 54 c in 360 s under 1 sun and maintained 75 of its initial absorption capacity after five cycles zhang et al 2020 in addition carbonization is a simple and valid shortcut to obtaining photothermal conversion ability reducing the complexity of preparing functional photothermal materials at an earlier stage li et al 2021 the surface temperature of a polydimethylsiloxane modified woody carbon absorbent pdms wcs could increase to 75 c within 1 min when exposed to 1 5 suns and its absorption rate for crude oil was 2 times that of fresh wood derived aerogel wu et al 2020b the low oil water selectivity and recycling efficiency caused by the inherent hydrophilicity and poor mechanical properties of biomass aerogels can also be improved by carbonization dong et al 2021 however most aerogels with excellent photothermal conversion performance for high viscosity oil absorption are currently obtained by the top down preparation method which usually requires more pretreatment steps involving either complex chemical treatments or extensive energy consumption fu et al 2018 the bottom up method is simple and sufficiently practical to effectively avoid these deficiencies herein we present a facile method for the successful preparation of hydrophobic lipophilic and compressible carbonized aerogels that contain only biomass for efficient disposal of oily water crosslinked aerogels made of chitosan and citric acid were prepared using directional freezing and freeze drying techniques subsequently the carbonization temperature was changed to adjust the compression elasticity and photothermal conversion properties the present study suggests a green and scalable strategy to prepare polymorphic oil absorbents for the purification of complex oily wastewater containing organic solvents light oils and heavy oils 2 experimental section 2 1 aerogel preparation the preparation steps for compressible biomass based aerogels are shown in fig 1 first chitosan cs and citric acid ca were successively added to a 1 wt acetic acid solution and the mixture was stirred for several hours until it was completely dissolved and dispersed the molds were filled with the solution and placed on copper plates that were sunken in liquid nitrogen the samples were frozen directionally for 20 min under a temperature gradient formed by the copper plates and then maintained at ambient temperature for 12 h to ensure complete gelation the samples were then frozen at 60 c for 6 h and placed in a vacuum freeze dryer for 72 h to fully remove the liquid phase finally fully dried aerogels with a spatial crosslinking network structure were obtained to obtain the sample with the best performance we varied the chitosan content in the acetic acid solution and set four concentrations 4 g l 1 6 g l 1 8 g l 1 and 10 g l 1 the mass ratios of chitosan and citric acid were modified to prepare a series of aerogels with ratios of 1 0 1 0 6 1 0 9 and 1 1 2 the prepared aerogel products were placed in a tubular furnace and heated to 200 c 250 c 300 c 350 c 400 c 500 c or 600 c at a rate of 5 c min 1 under an argon atmosphere and maintained at the respective temperature for 2 h to ensure full carbonization carbonized aerogels were then obtained by natural cooling hydrophobic aerogels were obtained after the deposition of methyltrimethoxysilane mtms vapor on the aerogels carbonized aerogels and two open containers with mtms and deionized water were simultaneously placed in a sealed box at 80 c for 6 h the modified samples were then placed in a vacuum oven for 1 h to remove the excess silane and water the hydrophobically modified samples are hereafter referred to as csxca to indicate the uncarbonized cs ca aerogels where x denotes the chitosan concentration i e 4 g l 1 6 g l 1 8 g l 1 or 10 g l 1 the aerogels carbonized at different temperatures were referred to as csxca y fig s1 where y denotes the carbonization temperature i e 200 c 250 c 300 c 350 c 400 c 500 c or 600 c the aerogels without citric acid were referred to as csx y because the aerogels prepared in the experiment exhibited the best performance when the chitosan citric acid ratio was 1 0 9 the ratio of all samples mentioned in this paper was 1 0 9 unless otherwise specified 2 2 oil and organic solvent absorption experiment the dried sample weight and mass of water were first determined and a small amount of oil or organic solvent was placed in water csxca y was placed on the oil layer floating on the water surface to absorb the oil when the sample was saturated the sample was removed the oil droplets adhering to the exterior of the aerogel were wiped off and the mass of the absorbed sample and the remaining water were determined the mass absorption capacity was calculated using eq 1 and the separation efficiency was calculated using eq 2 1 absorption capacity g g 1 m m 0 m 0 where m 0 is the mass of the sample before absorption and m is the mass of the sample after absorption 2 separation efficiency w 2 w 1 100 here w 1 is the mass of the water before absorption and w 2 is the mass of the water after absorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of characterization results using chitosan from marine crustaceans as the skeleton and citric acid from plant fruits as the crosslinking agent biomass based aerogels with excellent biodegradability were prepared for the separation of oil water and rapid cleanup of high viscosity oil fig 2 illustrates the skeleton of cs6ca 300 which primarily displays a layered carbon sheet structure longitudinally and a cross linked sheet structure with a folded surface in the cross section the connection effect achieved by the action of citric acid as a bridge in the aerogel structure was emphasized in the scanning electron microscopy sem images of cs6ca 300 fig 2d and cs6ca fig 2e by endowing chitosan macromolecules with staggered and entangled structures while enhancing intermolecular interactions crosslinking improves the mechanical characteristics of the fibers zhang et al 2023 the cross sections of the citric acid free chitosan aerogels exhibited large layered structures without cross linking bridges after carbonization at 300 c for 2 h leading to a loss of superior mechanical capabilities fig 2f low temperature carbonization which resulted in macromolecular dehydration and depolymerization contributed to the pore volume of the aerogel and the smooth edge of the sheet structure as was evident in the case of cs6ca 300 fig 2b and 2d this was in contrast to the tightly packed and chaotic skeletal structure of cs6ca fig 2e however when the carbonization temperature was increased the banded cross linked structures observed in cs6ca 350 cs6ca 400 and cs6ca 500 fig s2 gradually disappeared instead massively increased sheet structures led to rows of open holes and disappearance of the connection between channels as the carbonization temperature was increased to 600 c more skeleton structures were depolymerized resulting in an isotropic 3d staggered network that resulted in the loss of low curvature channels the crystal phase composition and chemical structure of various samples changed with the modification methods x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the carbonized aerogels are shown in figs 3 a and s3 the chitosan used in this study is a polymer in which strong intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds make it difficult to dissolve in water and some organic solvents however the primary amines of chitosan can be protonated and positively charged under acidic conditions ph 6 making chitosan a water soluble cationic polyelectrolyte pillai et al 2009 in addition the reaction between the amino groups at the c2 position of the chitosan molecule and the carboxyl groups of citric acid results in destruction of the original hydrogen bonds and crystal structure of chitosan for csxca y the chitosan crystalline structures of form i 2θ 10 and form ii 2θ 20 almost disappeared fig 3a indicating that crosslinking and carbonization altered the molecular structure of chitosan in the aerogels muley et al 2019 the disappearance of these two peaks can be observed in figs 3a and s3 a strong amorphous diffraction peak was evident that appeared near 2θ 23 5 for seven carbonized aerogels corresponding to the 002 crystal plane of graphite carbon long et al 2021 additionally a low dispersion diffraction peak at 2θ 40 50 was observed pointing to the 100 crystal plane of the graphite type carbon materials meng et al 2022 according to the aforementioned data the carbonized aerogels used in this study were composed of graphite and amorphous carbon which is a critical element for aerogels to exhibit outstanding photothermal conversion performance li et al 2022 to further explain the impact of the interaction between chitosan and citric acid hydrophobic modification and carbonization on aerogel products fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used to analyze the chemical structures of the aerogels as shown in fig 3b the peak at 1550 cm 1 of the pure chitosan aerogel corresponded to the nh2 in plane deformation which disappeared after crosslinking with citric acid a new and obvious peak appeared at 1715 cm 1 in cs6ca compared to chitosan aerogels which originated from the stretching vibration of c o in citric acid li et al 2012 indicating successful introduction of citric acid the n h in plane bending vibration of amide ii around 1571 cm 1 was evidence of an amide reaction between the amino groups of chitosan and the carboxyl groups of citric acid accompanied by generation of co nh after crosslinking with citric acid the aerogel showed a new characteristic peak at 1522 cm 1 which was mainly attributed to the ionic crosslinking reaction between the protonated amino groups from chitosan and the carboxyl groups from citric acid which may have been associated with the electrostatic interaction between chitosan and citric acid berger et al 2004 the molecular structures formed by the amide and ion crosslinking reactions are illustrated in fig 1 after hydrophobic modification ftir analysis indicated that the characteristic stretching absorption peaks at 1271 cm 1 and 776 cm 1 corresponding to asymmetric si c were related to mtms moreover the reactive methoxy groups of mtms were hydrolyzed to silicon hydroxyl groups which were then further covalently crosslinked with the hydroxyl groups of chitosan and the carboxyl groups of citric acid through condensation as indicated by the absorption peak at 1025 cm 1 caused by si o si and si o c stretching han et al 2021 in addition no relevant mtms peaks were found in the 29si or 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectra of the water sample treated with cs6ca 300 for 1 h fig s6 indicating a strong combination between mtms and the aerogels the only peak in the 29si spectrum corresponded to the sio2 structure of the nmr tube shirotori et al 2017 the surface chemical structures of the samples were also investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in figs 3 and s5 the high resolution c 1s spectrum of cs6ca 300 fig 3d was divided into five peaks c c 248 8 ev c n 285 48 ev c oh 286 48 ev c o c 288 48 ev and c o 289 88 ev the appearance of co nh 400 48 ev and c nh3 403 18 ev in the n 1s spectrum confirmed the chemical and ionic cross linking reactions between chitosan and citric acid zhang et al 2023 the peaks at 102 88 ev and 103 28 ev in the si 2p spectrum corresponded to si o and si c respectively which verified the chemical reaction between mtms and csca skeleton leading to the formation of a siloxane coating yi et al 2020 since acetic acid ionizes fewer hydrogen ions than citric acid cs6 300 fig s5 contained a lower peak intensity of c o and c nh3 and a higher peak intensity of c nh2 with an increase in the carbonization temperature the cooh content in the sample decreased leading to a decrease in the c nh3 generated by the ionic reaction with c nh2 resulting in the peak intensity of c nh3 in cs6ca 300 being lower than that of cs6ca 200 to select samples with optimum cyclic absorption performance it is essential to study the thermal stability and composition of the aerogels at various temperatures fig s4d and s4e there was only one weight loss stage in the thermal decomposition process of the pure chitosan aerogel which was associated with the breakdown of the chitosan molecular chain and had a maximal mass loss peak near 283 c however three stages were observed in the thermal gravimetric analysis tga curves of the hydrophilic cs ca aerogel corresponding to breakage of the citric acid side chain amide bond cleavage between chitosan and citric acid and breakage of the glycosidic bond the final mass retention rate of the two aerogels was approximately 30 additionally the 3d network of cs6ca y was preserved with increased pore size after carbonization enabling aerogels to exhibit notable oil absorption ability and compression elasticity the axial compression elasticities of the cs6ca y and chitosan aerogels were tested figs 4 and s7 as shown in fig 4a and 4b and movie s1 cs6ca 300 exhibited excellent resilience it was able to withstand 50 deformation and return to its initial shape after releasing pressure fig 4b and 4c show the stress strain curves of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 after 10 cycles of compression at a constant compression strain of 60 in which two distinct regions could be observed after the load was generated including the linear elastic region and the yield stage relatively low external forces caused elastic deformation of the aerogel as the applied weight increases the skeleton structure undergoes incompletely reducible plastic deformation and begins to densify resulting in energy loss during pressure release nyman et al 2009 after releasing the stress the deformation of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 could be restored to approximately 90 of the original height and the microscopic 3d network structure remained unchanged after 10 compression cycles compared to the original sample fig s8 more importantly if the compressed aerogel became saturated with the oil phase nearly 100 of its original shape could be regained the excellent resilience and fatigue resistance may have been mainly attributed to partial molecular chain fracture through citric acid crosslinking and low temperature carbonization which provided sufficient space for elastic deformation to avoid the risk of pore collapse in addition mtms also contributed to elastic deformation which was manifested by the fact that polysiloxane coatings enhanced the mechanical compression performance of aerogel frameworks and the repulsive interaction between polysiloxane methyl groups also played an important role yi et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 therefore cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 have excellent potential for cleaning up oil spills owing to their reusability by manual squeezing to release oil 3 2 low viscosity oil absorption the surface wettability of cs6ca y is shown in fig 5 the unmodified aerogels exhibited rapid absorption for both water and pump oil fig 5a indicating their amphiphilic characteristics in sharp contrast only pump oil penetrated easily into the aerogel when water and oil droplets were dropped on the modified cs6ca 300 surface the water contact angle was 134 4 signifying that the introduction of mtms offered good integration of hydrophobicity and lipophilicity fig 5b cs6ca 300 still possessed a high affinity for oil and a strong repulsion for water after being cut in half as illustrated in fig 5c further confirming its hydrophobicity these findings highlighted that hydrophobic modification via simple chemical vapor deposition cvd was successful in imparting hydrophobicity and super lipophilicity to the interior skeleton surface of cs6ca y in addition to its exterior surface because the hydrophilic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in cs6ca y were reduced by carbonization fig 5e shows that the water contact angles of aerogels without mtms also increased with the pyrolysis temperature interestingly the unmodified aerogels even achieved a water contact angle of 130 4 after carbonization at 600 c which was nearly identical to the modified cs6ca 600 to unify the variables all aerogels used for oil absorption were hydrophobically treated when cs6ca 300 was immersed in water fig 5d many bubbles appeared on the surface of the immersed part owing to its strong water resistance these bubbles rapidly disappeared after being removed from the water leaving only a few droplets on the surface in a stable sphere additionally the constant weight of cs6ca 300 proved that it did not absorb any water indicating its excellent water resistance and mechanical stability under water both of which are essential for oil absorption on the water surface with the advantages of high porosity excellent compressive elasticity and hydrophobicity silylated cs6ca y has great potential as a 3d absorbent for rapid removal of oils and organic pollutants from water the mass absorption capacity g g 1 was used to evaluate the oil removal ability of cs6ca y as shown in fig 6 a when a piece of cs6ca 300 came in contact with the gear oil water mixture it selectively absorbed the floating gear oil yellow but did not absorb water it is desirable that the water surface after oil removal contained no traces of yellow gear oil furthermore the oil water separation efficiencies of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 for different types of oil under different environmental conditions were measured as shown in fig s11 separation efficiencies were maintained 99 regardless of whether a single oil or mixed oils were added in both acidic ph 2 or alkaline ph 12 conditions and at either high 65 c or low temperatures 5 c the absorption capacities of cs6ca y for organic contaminants and of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 for various oily liquids were tested figs 6b 6c and s10 in conclusion absorption capacities from 40 125 g g 1 could be achieved for cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 the mass absorption capacity generally increased with the density of the absorbates which was consistent with the experimental data however the volume of oil absorbed per unit absorbent mass was not significantly related to the absorbates density and the absorption volume of each absorbent did not differ considerably indicating that the volume of oil absorbed was related to the pore volume of the absorbent oil and organic solvents were attracted by the hydrophobic surface of aerogels and diffused into the large pores of the staggered network which were the two main factors contributing to the excellent oil absorption and storage capacity of csxca y however this behavior is resisted by liquids with higher viscosity and surface tension because the surface molecules accumulate more closely therefore it can be seen in fig 6c that although acetone has a lower density than liquid paraffin and vacuum pump oil its lower viscosity and surface tension are more beneficial for high absorption capacity in addition the volume capacities of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 for pump oil and organic solvents ranged from 70 100 indicating that most of the pore volume was occupied by oil or organic solvents according to the pore size distribution of cs6ca y tables 1 and s1 the main reason for the low specific surface area was the presence of micron sized ice crystals whereas the presence of macropores facilitated the entry of oil droplets into the pores the oil and organic solvents absorbed by cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 were recovered by simple extrusion after releasing the pressure the squeezed aerogel almost returned to its original shape and its initial height and morphology were completely restored when it was placed into the oil phase again movie s2 owing to its stable hydrophobicity and mechanical strength the mass of dried cs6ca 300 with an initial mass of 4 2 mg was 4 0 mg after 10 cycles of pump oil absorption 3 3 photothermal conversion performance and heavy oil absorption the removal methods used for oil organic solvents that are easily absorbed under conventional conditions are unsuitable for heavy oils with high viscosities therefore an approach to reduce the oil viscosity by solar assisted heating is proposed to improve the absorption capacity and absorption rate of high viscosity oil the black surface and graphite type carbon of cs6ca y contributed significantly to efficient photothermal conversion performance the reflection and transmission spectra of cs6ca y in the wavelength range of 200 2600 nm were measured fig s12 to obtain the absorbance and clarify the influence of carbonization on light absorption figs 7 a and s12a in the ultraviolet and visible regions the light absorption of cs6ca 200 and cs6ca 250 decreased to 70 whereas those of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 600 remained at 77 and 90 respectively on one hand the black surface and amorphous carbon were advantageous in terms of light absorption on the other hand the 3d cross linked pore structure could enhance absorption of incident light by reflecting it multiple times to further explore the photothermal conversion performance of cs6ca y an infrared thermal imager was used to record the real time temperature fields of the samples in air and floating on oil first the temperature changes of cs6ca y placed in air were measured under three illumination intensities of 0 5 sun 1 sun and 1 5 suns fig 7b a handmade foam container containing cs6ca y was used to prevent heat loss from the convective heat transfer as expected the higher the incident illumination intensity and carbonization degree the higher the sample surface temperature the standard deviation of the sample surface temperatures under all light intensities was 1 c the maximum surface temperatures of cs6ca 200 and cs6ca 250 could only reach 45 7 c and 56 c under 1 sun respectively fig s13 however the mean and maximum surface temperatures of cs6ca 300 increased to 60 c and 70 c within 20 s fig s15 respectively and reached the equilibrium state of approximately 70 c and 80 c within 1 min respectively it is equally important to test the photothermal conversion stability by constantly turning the simulated solar light source system on and off to evaluate whether the samples could rapidly reach a sufficient temperature during the recycling process as shown in fig 7c the mean and maximum temperatures on the upper surface of cs6ca 300 reached equilibrium within 1 min under 1 sun irradiation and stabilized at 70 c and 80 c in five cycles respectively and the surface temperature rapidly recovered to the initial state within 1 min of turning off the light cs6ca 350 also exhibited excellent photothermal conversion stability fig 7d infrared thermal images of the photothermal transformation stability of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 for five cycles are shown in figs 7e and s15 respectively in addition the shape and mechanical stability of cs6ca 300 remained excellent after solar assisted heating fig s14 providing an important basis for the absorption of high viscosity oil under sunlight cs6ca 300 in this work was compared with that in other literatures as shown in table 2 among biomass based absorbents cs6ca 300 has great competitiveness in absorption and photothermal properties chang et al 2018 chao et al 2020 kong et al 2022 singh and jelinek 2020 varshney et al 2022 wang et al 2022 wu et al 2020b yi et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 thermal conductivity is an important parameter that affects heat transfer and management the top surface of the aerogel captures the incident light and converts it into heat which is subsequently transferred to the bottom mainly by heat conduction thereby heating the surrounding oil a thermal analyzer was used to measure the thermal conductivities of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 at 60 c as indicated in table 1 the temperature variations of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 floating on the oil surface were measured under illumination intensities of 0 5 sun 1 sun and 1 5 suns the surface temperature had a positive linear correlation with the illumination intensity and carbonization temperature with a standard deviation of 1 c fig 8 a the ambient temperature was low during the experiment 5 c outdoors and approximately 15 c indoors air convection was generated near the samples to more realistically simulate the outdoor conditions of oil water separation compared to the samples placed in the foam container artificial air convection and the lack of foam protection caused the surface temperature to decrease by approximately 10 c as shown in fig 8b and 8c the solid liquid interface temperatures of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 increased to 37 4 c and 45 c respectively and the large heat loss caused the subsequent temperature to change slowly oil viscosity is a pivotal parameter for determining the absorption rate gear oil 460 and vacuum pump oil were selected as representative oils and their viscosities at different temperatures were tested as shown in fig s16 illumination improved the absorption rate and capacity of cs6ca 300 this was because low viscosity oil can enter smaller pores more smoothly whereas high viscosity oil would be blocked in the orifice it could be inferred from fig s16 cs6ca 300 had the most rapid absorption rate for gear oil 460 compared to cs6ca 400 cs6ca 500 and cs6ca 600 although cs6ca 300 had relatively low absorbance apparent density and total pore capacity its 3d cross linked pore structure with low curvature and large pore diameter was beneficial for rapid and massive oil absorption to verify the above results and conjectures more intuitively 0 15 ml of gear oil was dropped on cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 and the absorption dynamics were qualitatively observed under 1 sun illumination fig 8e g simultaneously the absorption states of gear oil on cs6ca 300 without simulated solar illumination were recorded it took 2 days for cs6ca 300 without irradiation to completely absorb oil but only 7 min and 10 min for cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 respectively under 1 sun the temperature changes of the samples and oil droplets can be clearly observed in fig 8f and 8g the gear oil absorption and recovery performances of cs6ca 300 under 1 sun irradiation were quantitatively compared fig s17 in the absence of light the saturated absorption of gear oil was 39 g g 1 and 23 g g 1 of gear oil in total could be recovered after seven extrusions under 1 sun 44 g g 1 of gear oil was absorbed during the first absorption despite a 66 recovery rate during the first absorption the subsequent four recoveries were all comparable to the absorbed amount with recovery rates 80 after completely drying cs6ca 300 using isooctane to clean off the gear oil adhering to the skeleton the microstructures of the samples without compression with one compression and with five compressions after absorption were compared sem images fig s17 indicated that the samples in all three compression states maintained an intact pore structure and that only part of the striped skeleton was crushed after five compressions for cs6ca 300 3 4 removal of leaked crude oil and prospects for development to simulate real application scenarios more accurately the absorption capacity of cs6ca 300 was measured using crude oil as the absorbed object figs 9 and s18 first crude oil was dropped onto the aerogel surface at room temperature and the absorption speed was compared qualitatively with and without illumination when the ambient temperature was 20 c it took 42 min for cs6ca 300 to completely absorb the crude oil droplets on the surface without light cs6ca 300 absorbed the same mass of crude oil in only 10 s under 1 sun crude oil 56 g g 1 could be absorbed for the first time and 30 g g 1 of crude oil could be recovered stably by simple squeezing during the cycle when the crude oil was placed in a seawater environment salinity 3 5 wt temperature 4 c cs6ca 300 barely absorbed crude oil without light fig 9 movie s3 while the temperature of the crude oil around cs6ca 300 was increased to 25 c under 1 sun irradiation so that the crude oil had a higher fluidity and cs6ca 300 could be saturated within 10 min fig 9 movies s4 and s5 in summary solar assisted heating to reduce oil viscosity is a promising method for enhancing the heavy oil absorption rate and capacity the absorbent materials used in this study are rich in sources easy to prepare and have excellent oil absorption and recovery abilities in an actual complex environment this work provides a simple and environmentally friendly method for large scale production of high performance absorbents using biological resources and their application in the cleaning of actual polymorphic oil polluted water in future research the internal pores can be optimized in terms of modulation for example the verticality of internal pore channels can be further increased to enhance the oil absorption rate the mechanical strength and elasticity of the aerogel can be enhanced by constructing a lamellar structure and adding cross linking agents to improve cyclic utilization and recovery efficiency in terms of enhancing the mobility of crude oil in addition to the use of natural light artificial light sources can also be used for emergency treatment of oil contamination to recover the absorbent more rapidly after absorbing oil directional inducers can be added to the absorbent for controlled and efficient recovery of the absorbent such as magnetic and light driven materials moreover the utilized oil absorbing aerogels are expected to have secondary applications in other fields such as electrode materials through further carbonization or other treatments which can contribute to addressing problems caused by waste disposal 4 conclusion in this study hydrophobic and oleophilic 3d porous carbonized aerogels were synthesized via simple freeze drying low temperature carbonization and hydrophobic modification cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 exhibited excellent mechanical and thermal stability as well as excellent photothermal conversion performance because of ionic and chemical crosslinking from citric acid and carbonization as a result cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 demonstrated ultra high absorption capacities of up to 40 125 g g 1 with oil water separation efficiencies exceeding 99 and had excellent recycling abilities maintaining high absorption capacities after 10 cycles in addition the mean surface temperature of cs6ca 300 floating on the oil surface could exceed 60 c in a simulated environment with 1 sun illumination and cold air convection thus increasing the recovery rate of high viscosity oil considering the abundant sources and facile preparation method this work provides a novel avenue to manufacture high performance polymorphic oil absorbents from biological resources on a large

15056,leakage of oils and organic solvents poses a significant threat to aquatic environments here low temperature carbonized aerogels with highly porous and anisotropic structures obtained only from biomass derived materials were proposed to absorb polymorphic oils from contaminated water specifically carbonized aerogels prepared at temperatures of 300 c and 350 c exhibited ultra high absorption capacities 40 125 g g 1 and oil water separation efficiencies 99 even in harsh environments which were attributed to their exceptional properties including high porosity abundant macropores excellent thermal stability and hydrophobicity through citric acid crosslinking and low temperature carbonization the aerogels exhibited superior compression elasticity and could be cyclically utilized through simple extrusion while realizing the recovery of oils moreover the outstanding photothermal conversion properties obtained through carbonization contributed to the high temperature and fluidity of the oils surrounding the aerogels which is crucial for improving the absorption performance of high viscosity oils such absorbent materials are used to separate crude oil from oil water mixtures which can achieve maximum absorption of 56 g g 1 and increase the absorption rate from several days to 10 min in a low temperature 4 c seawater environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polymorphic oil cleanup biomass based aerogels carbonization compression elasticity photothermal conversion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction frequent oil spills and chemical leakage have caused a series of environmental pollution and ecological problems that required urgent remediation chen et al 2019 therefore various technologies applied in the disposal of oil spills such as chemical treatment physical absorption in situ combustion and bioremediation have emerged deng et al 2020 physical absorption has attracted the most attention because of its low cost environmental friendliness high efficiency and ease of operation zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 for physical absorption multitudinous three dimensional 3d porous materials have been adopted as the absorbents including ultramicroporous metal organic frameworks gong et al 2022 rice husk derived biochar angelova et al 2011 powder wang et al 2021 and sponges wu et al 2020a zhao et al 2014 these materials exhibit desirable absorption performance and are convenient for large scale practical applications liu and qiu 2020 sponges composed of polyurethane pu and melamine have been widely used for oil water separation owing to their high porosity ultra low density and low cost das et al 2021 for example melamine sponge is a superb absorbent with an absorption capacity of up to 87 194 times its own weight wang et al 2019 a graphene pu sponge was shown to effectively separate oil water mixtures and surfactant stabilized emulsions with efficiencies of 99 99 and 99 91 respectively kong et al 2017 however the use of sponges and foams made of synthetic macromolecules carries the risk of secondary pollution owing to their refractory degradation yin et al 2020 biomass based aerogels with 3d variable networks are promising candidates because of their adjustable wettability and high porosity dilamian and noroozi 2021 compared to synthetic materials they are highly competitive because of their inherent advantages such as abundant sources ecological friendliness biodegradability and renewability to date various aerogels have been developed based on biomass materials including wood zhu et al 2019 cellulose feng et al 2015 lignin partow et al 2022 chitin huang et al 2021 and bamboo jiao et al 2016 long et al long et al 2021 prepared a carbonized aerogel from deep eutectic solvent modified cellulose nanofibers cnf which possessed a volume absorption capability of 74 95 for oils and organic pollutants the superhydrophobic carbon fiber aerogel obtained from direct pyrolysis of cotton has an absorption capacity of up to 50 200 g g 1 for various oil stains bi et al 2013 in aerogel preparation the pore structure is usually initially tuned to obtain a high absorption capacity and rapid absorption rate by nanofibrillating waste boxboard pulp and subsequently diluting the cnf suspension nanocellulose aerobeads exhibited ultralow density as low as 0 005 g cm 3 and high porosity 99 6 with a high absorption capacity of up to 279 g g 1 for castor oil karzar jeddi et al 2019 a wood based carbonized aerogel with a low curvature stacked laminate structure was created via delignification its absorption capacity for carbon tetrachloride is 21 times that of natural wood and the absorption equilibrium for peanut oil can reach tens of seconds wan et al 2019 cyclic utilization is a crucial consideration when evaluating oil absorbents recovery of absorbed oil by straightforward physical squeezing has gradually become a necessary feature of good absorbents which requires excellent mechanical strength and elasticity because of their inherent drawbacks including fragility and insufficient mechanical strength biomass derived absorbents must be modified to satisfy such demands dong et al dong et al 2021 used two dimensional reduced graphene oxide nanosheets to construct carbon layers and cellulose nanocrystals to form macroscopic wave carbon layers which also consisted of the prehydrolysis liquor as a tackifier the wavy layered structure contributed significantly to super compression withstanding 95 strains and super elasticity retention of approximately 100 after 500 cycles at 50 strain yi et al yi et al 2020 prepared chitosan aerogels with a spring like skeleton by controlling the vertical growth of the ice crystals this unique structure provided sufficient space for elastic deformation thereby maintaining an almost constant absorption efficiency over 10 cycles additionally after selective removal of hemicellulose and lignin wood is also commonly modified to serve as an absorbent with excellent compressive elasticity guan et al 2018 song et al 2017 and its wavy structure is often mimicked by various compressible non woody absorbents conventional absorbents are usually invalidated when treating polluted water containing high viscosity oils yu et al 2020 the critical reason is that poor fluidity increases the difficulty for high viscosity oils to diffuse into the pore structure resulting in a significant loss in the absorption rate and capacity kong et al 2022 in general high temperatures are beneficial for increasing the fluidity of heavy oils as a type of clean energy solar energy can be used as a heat source to heat the absorbent and surrounding oil thus reducing the oil viscosity for more effective cleaning singh and jelinek 2020 efficient capture of sunlight and rapid photothermal conversion can be achieved by adding photothermal materials such as carbon nanotubes zhu et al 2019 mxene zheng et al 2022 or reduced graphene oxide chao et al 2020 to aerogels the bottom temperature of 42 c could be achieved within 3 min when the lipophilic wood sponge was coated with ti3c2tx mxene nanosheets and the crude oil absorption rate increased by nearly 2 5 times via in situ auxiliary heating under sunlight illumination of 1 5 kw m 2 note that 1 kw m 2 1 sun therefore 1 kw m 2 is expressed as 1 sun in the following paragraphs wang et al 2022 a pomelo peel based photothermal sponge decorated with polypyrrole reached a temperature of 54 c in 360 s under 1 sun and maintained 75 of its initial absorption capacity after five cycles zhang et al 2020 in addition carbonization is a simple and valid shortcut to obtaining photothermal conversion ability reducing the complexity of preparing functional photothermal materials at an earlier stage li et al 2021 the surface temperature of a polydimethylsiloxane modified woody carbon absorbent pdms wcs could increase to 75 c within 1 min when exposed to 1 5 suns and its absorption rate for crude oil was 2 times that of fresh wood derived aerogel wu et al 2020b the low oil water selectivity and recycling efficiency caused by the inherent hydrophilicity and poor mechanical properties of biomass aerogels can also be improved by carbonization dong et al 2021 however most aerogels with excellent photothermal conversion performance for high viscosity oil absorption are currently obtained by the top down preparation method which usually requires more pretreatment steps involving either complex chemical treatments or extensive energy consumption fu et al 2018 the bottom up method is simple and sufficiently practical to effectively avoid these deficiencies herein we present a facile method for the successful preparation of hydrophobic lipophilic and compressible carbonized aerogels that contain only biomass for efficient disposal of oily water crosslinked aerogels made of chitosan and citric acid were prepared using directional freezing and freeze drying techniques subsequently the carbonization temperature was changed to adjust the compression elasticity and photothermal conversion properties the present study suggests a green and scalable strategy to prepare polymorphic oil absorbents for the purification of complex oily wastewater containing organic solvents light oils and heavy oils 2 experimental section 2 1 aerogel preparation the preparation steps for compressible biomass based aerogels are shown in fig 1 first chitosan cs and citric acid ca were successively added to a 1 wt acetic acid solution and the mixture was stirred for several hours until it was completely dissolved and dispersed the molds were filled with the solution and placed on copper plates that were sunken in liquid nitrogen the samples were frozen directionally for 20 min under a temperature gradient formed by the copper plates and then maintained at ambient temperature for 12 h to ensure complete gelation the samples were then frozen at 60 c for 6 h and placed in a vacuum freeze dryer for 72 h to fully remove the liquid phase finally fully dried aerogels with a spatial crosslinking network structure were obtained to obtain the sample with the best performance we varied the chitosan content in the acetic acid solution and set four concentrations 4 g l 1 6 g l 1 8 g l 1 and 10 g l 1 the mass ratios of chitosan and citric acid were modified to prepare a series of aerogels with ratios of 1 0 1 0 6 1 0 9 and 1 1 2 the prepared aerogel products were placed in a tubular furnace and heated to 200 c 250 c 300 c 350 c 400 c 500 c or 600 c at a rate of 5 c min 1 under an argon atmosphere and maintained at the respective temperature for 2 h to ensure full carbonization carbonized aerogels were then obtained by natural cooling hydrophobic aerogels were obtained after the deposition of methyltrimethoxysilane mtms vapor on the aerogels carbonized aerogels and two open containers with mtms and deionized water were simultaneously placed in a sealed box at 80 c for 6 h the modified samples were then placed in a vacuum oven for 1 h to remove the excess silane and water the hydrophobically modified samples are hereafter referred to as csxca to indicate the uncarbonized cs ca aerogels where x denotes the chitosan concentration i e 4 g l 1 6 g l 1 8 g l 1 or 10 g l 1 the aerogels carbonized at different temperatures were referred to as csxca y fig s1 where y denotes the carbonization temperature i e 200 c 250 c 300 c 350 c 400 c 500 c or 600 c the aerogels without citric acid were referred to as csx y because the aerogels prepared in the experiment exhibited the best performance when the chitosan citric acid ratio was 1 0 9 the ratio of all samples mentioned in this paper was 1 0 9 unless otherwise specified 2 2 oil and organic solvent absorption experiment the dried sample weight and mass of water were first determined and a small amount of oil or organic solvent was placed in water csxca y was placed on the oil layer floating on the water surface to absorb the oil when the sample was saturated the sample was removed the oil droplets adhering to the exterior of the aerogel were wiped off and the mass of the absorbed sample and the remaining water were determined the mass absorption capacity was calculated using eq 1 and the separation efficiency was calculated using eq 2 1 absorption capacity g g 1 m m 0 m 0 where m 0 is the mass of the sample before absorption and m is the mass of the sample after absorption 2 separation efficiency w 2 w 1 100 here w 1 is the mass of the water before absorption and w 2 is the mass of the water after absorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of characterization results using chitosan from marine crustaceans as the skeleton and citric acid from plant fruits as the crosslinking agent biomass based aerogels with excellent biodegradability were prepared for the separation of oil water and rapid cleanup of high viscosity oil fig 2 illustrates the skeleton of cs6ca 300 which primarily displays a layered carbon sheet structure longitudinally and a cross linked sheet structure with a folded surface in the cross section the connection effect achieved by the action of citric acid as a bridge in the aerogel structure was emphasized in the scanning electron microscopy sem images of cs6ca 300 fig 2d and cs6ca fig 2e by endowing chitosan macromolecules with staggered and entangled structures while enhancing intermolecular interactions crosslinking improves the mechanical characteristics of the fibers zhang et al 2023 the cross sections of the citric acid free chitosan aerogels exhibited large layered structures without cross linking bridges after carbonization at 300 c for 2 h leading to a loss of superior mechanical capabilities fig 2f low temperature carbonization which resulted in macromolecular dehydration and depolymerization contributed to the pore volume of the aerogel and the smooth edge of the sheet structure as was evident in the case of cs6ca 300 fig 2b and 2d this was in contrast to the tightly packed and chaotic skeletal structure of cs6ca fig 2e however when the carbonization temperature was increased the banded cross linked structures observed in cs6ca 350 cs6ca 400 and cs6ca 500 fig s2 gradually disappeared instead massively increased sheet structures led to rows of open holes and disappearance of the connection between channels as the carbonization temperature was increased to 600 c more skeleton structures were depolymerized resulting in an isotropic 3d staggered network that resulted in the loss of low curvature channels the crystal phase composition and chemical structure of various samples changed with the modification methods x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the carbonized aerogels are shown in figs 3 a and s3 the chitosan used in this study is a polymer in which strong intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds make it difficult to dissolve in water and some organic solvents however the primary amines of chitosan can be protonated and positively charged under acidic conditions ph 6 making chitosan a water soluble cationic polyelectrolyte pillai et al 2009 in addition the reaction between the amino groups at the c2 position of the chitosan molecule and the carboxyl groups of citric acid results in destruction of the original hydrogen bonds and crystal structure of chitosan for csxca y the chitosan crystalline structures of form i 2θ 10 and form ii 2θ 20 almost disappeared fig 3a indicating that crosslinking and carbonization altered the molecular structure of chitosan in the aerogels muley et al 2019 the disappearance of these two peaks can be observed in figs 3a and s3 a strong amorphous diffraction peak was evident that appeared near 2θ 23 5 for seven carbonized aerogels corresponding to the 002 crystal plane of graphite carbon long et al 2021 additionally a low dispersion diffraction peak at 2θ 40 50 was observed pointing to the 100 crystal plane of the graphite type carbon materials meng et al 2022 according to the aforementioned data the carbonized aerogels used in this study were composed of graphite and amorphous carbon which is a critical element for aerogels to exhibit outstanding photothermal conversion performance li et al 2022 to further explain the impact of the interaction between chitosan and citric acid hydrophobic modification and carbonization on aerogel products fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used to analyze the chemical structures of the aerogels as shown in fig 3b the peak at 1550 cm 1 of the pure chitosan aerogel corresponded to the nh2 in plane deformation which disappeared after crosslinking with citric acid a new and obvious peak appeared at 1715 cm 1 in cs6ca compared to chitosan aerogels which originated from the stretching vibration of c o in citric acid li et al 2012 indicating successful introduction of citric acid the n h in plane bending vibration of amide ii around 1571 cm 1 was evidence of an amide reaction between the amino groups of chitosan and the carboxyl groups of citric acid accompanied by generation of co nh after crosslinking with citric acid the aerogel showed a new characteristic peak at 1522 cm 1 which was mainly attributed to the ionic crosslinking reaction between the protonated amino groups from chitosan and the carboxyl groups from citric acid which may have been associated with the electrostatic interaction between chitosan and citric acid berger et al 2004 the molecular structures formed by the amide and ion crosslinking reactions are illustrated in fig 1 after hydrophobic modification ftir analysis indicated that the characteristic stretching absorption peaks at 1271 cm 1 and 776 cm 1 corresponding to asymmetric si c were related to mtms moreover the reactive methoxy groups of mtms were hydrolyzed to silicon hydroxyl groups which were then further covalently crosslinked with the hydroxyl groups of chitosan and the carboxyl groups of citric acid through condensation as indicated by the absorption peak at 1025 cm 1 caused by si o si and si o c stretching han et al 2021 in addition no relevant mtms peaks were found in the 29si or 13c nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectra of the water sample treated with cs6ca 300 for 1 h fig s6 indicating a strong combination between mtms and the aerogels the only peak in the 29si spectrum corresponded to the sio2 structure of the nmr tube shirotori et al 2017 the surface chemical structures of the samples were also investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in figs 3 and s5 the high resolution c 1s spectrum of cs6ca 300 fig 3d was divided into five peaks c c 248 8 ev c n 285 48 ev c oh 286 48 ev c o c 288 48 ev and c o 289 88 ev the appearance of co nh 400 48 ev and c nh3 403 18 ev in the n 1s spectrum confirmed the chemical and ionic cross linking reactions between chitosan and citric acid zhang et al 2023 the peaks at 102 88 ev and 103 28 ev in the si 2p spectrum corresponded to si o and si c respectively which verified the chemical reaction between mtms and csca skeleton leading to the formation of a siloxane coating yi et al 2020 since acetic acid ionizes fewer hydrogen ions than citric acid cs6 300 fig s5 contained a lower peak intensity of c o and c nh3 and a higher peak intensity of c nh2 with an increase in the carbonization temperature the cooh content in the sample decreased leading to a decrease in the c nh3 generated by the ionic reaction with c nh2 resulting in the peak intensity of c nh3 in cs6ca 300 being lower than that of cs6ca 200 to select samples with optimum cyclic absorption performance it is essential to study the thermal stability and composition of the aerogels at various temperatures fig s4d and s4e there was only one weight loss stage in the thermal decomposition process of the pure chitosan aerogel which was associated with the breakdown of the chitosan molecular chain and had a maximal mass loss peak near 283 c however three stages were observed in the thermal gravimetric analysis tga curves of the hydrophilic cs ca aerogel corresponding to breakage of the citric acid side chain amide bond cleavage between chitosan and citric acid and breakage of the glycosidic bond the final mass retention rate of the two aerogels was approximately 30 additionally the 3d network of cs6ca y was preserved with increased pore size after carbonization enabling aerogels to exhibit notable oil absorption ability and compression elasticity the axial compression elasticities of the cs6ca y and chitosan aerogels were tested figs 4 and s7 as shown in fig 4a and 4b and movie s1 cs6ca 300 exhibited excellent resilience it was able to withstand 50 deformation and return to its initial shape after releasing pressure fig 4b and 4c show the stress strain curves of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 after 10 cycles of compression at a constant compression strain of 60 in which two distinct regions could be observed after the load was generated including the linear elastic region and the yield stage relatively low external forces caused elastic deformation of the aerogel as the applied weight increases the skeleton structure undergoes incompletely reducible plastic deformation and begins to densify resulting in energy loss during pressure release nyman et al 2009 after releasing the stress the deformation of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 could be restored to approximately 90 of the original height and the microscopic 3d network structure remained unchanged after 10 compression cycles compared to the original sample fig s8 more importantly if the compressed aerogel became saturated with the oil phase nearly 100 of its original shape could be regained the excellent resilience and fatigue resistance may have been mainly attributed to partial molecular chain fracture through citric acid crosslinking and low temperature carbonization which provided sufficient space for elastic deformation to avoid the risk of pore collapse in addition mtms also contributed to elastic deformation which was manifested by the fact that polysiloxane coatings enhanced the mechanical compression performance of aerogel frameworks and the repulsive interaction between polysiloxane methyl groups also played an important role yi et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 therefore cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 have excellent potential for cleaning up oil spills owing to their reusability by manual squeezing to release oil 3 2 low viscosity oil absorption the surface wettability of cs6ca y is shown in fig 5 the unmodified aerogels exhibited rapid absorption for both water and pump oil fig 5a indicating their amphiphilic characteristics in sharp contrast only pump oil penetrated easily into the aerogel when water and oil droplets were dropped on the modified cs6ca 300 surface the water contact angle was 134 4 signifying that the introduction of mtms offered good integration of hydrophobicity and lipophilicity fig 5b cs6ca 300 still possessed a high affinity for oil and a strong repulsion for water after being cut in half as illustrated in fig 5c further confirming its hydrophobicity these findings highlighted that hydrophobic modification via simple chemical vapor deposition cvd was successful in imparting hydrophobicity and super lipophilicity to the interior skeleton surface of cs6ca y in addition to its exterior surface because the hydrophilic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in cs6ca y were reduced by carbonization fig 5e shows that the water contact angles of aerogels without mtms also increased with the pyrolysis temperature interestingly the unmodified aerogels even achieved a water contact angle of 130 4 after carbonization at 600 c which was nearly identical to the modified cs6ca 600 to unify the variables all aerogels used for oil absorption were hydrophobically treated when cs6ca 300 was immersed in water fig 5d many bubbles appeared on the surface of the immersed part owing to its strong water resistance these bubbles rapidly disappeared after being removed from the water leaving only a few droplets on the surface in a stable sphere additionally the constant weight of cs6ca 300 proved that it did not absorb any water indicating its excellent water resistance and mechanical stability under water both of which are essential for oil absorption on the water surface with the advantages of high porosity excellent compressive elasticity and hydrophobicity silylated cs6ca y has great potential as a 3d absorbent for rapid removal of oils and organic pollutants from water the mass absorption capacity g g 1 was used to evaluate the oil removal ability of cs6ca y as shown in fig 6 a when a piece of cs6ca 300 came in contact with the gear oil water mixture it selectively absorbed the floating gear oil yellow but did not absorb water it is desirable that the water surface after oil removal contained no traces of yellow gear oil furthermore the oil water separation efficiencies of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 for different types of oil under different environmental conditions were measured as shown in fig s11 separation efficiencies were maintained 99 regardless of whether a single oil or mixed oils were added in both acidic ph 2 or alkaline ph 12 conditions and at either high 65 c or low temperatures 5 c the absorption capacities of cs6ca y for organic contaminants and of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 for various oily liquids were tested figs 6b 6c and s10 in conclusion absorption capacities from 40 125 g g 1 could be achieved for cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 the mass absorption capacity generally increased with the density of the absorbates which was consistent with the experimental data however the volume of oil absorbed per unit absorbent mass was not significantly related to the absorbates density and the absorption volume of each absorbent did not differ considerably indicating that the volume of oil absorbed was related to the pore volume of the absorbent oil and organic solvents were attracted by the hydrophobic surface of aerogels and diffused into the large pores of the staggered network which were the two main factors contributing to the excellent oil absorption and storage capacity of csxca y however this behavior is resisted by liquids with higher viscosity and surface tension because the surface molecules accumulate more closely therefore it can be seen in fig 6c that although acetone has a lower density than liquid paraffin and vacuum pump oil its lower viscosity and surface tension are more beneficial for high absorption capacity in addition the volume capacities of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 for pump oil and organic solvents ranged from 70 100 indicating that most of the pore volume was occupied by oil or organic solvents according to the pore size distribution of cs6ca y tables 1 and s1 the main reason for the low specific surface area was the presence of micron sized ice crystals whereas the presence of macropores facilitated the entry of oil droplets into the pores the oil and organic solvents absorbed by cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 were recovered by simple extrusion after releasing the pressure the squeezed aerogel almost returned to its original shape and its initial height and morphology were completely restored when it was placed into the oil phase again movie s2 owing to its stable hydrophobicity and mechanical strength the mass of dried cs6ca 300 with an initial mass of 4 2 mg was 4 0 mg after 10 cycles of pump oil absorption 3 3 photothermal conversion performance and heavy oil absorption the removal methods used for oil organic solvents that are easily absorbed under conventional conditions are unsuitable for heavy oils with high viscosities therefore an approach to reduce the oil viscosity by solar assisted heating is proposed to improve the absorption capacity and absorption rate of high viscosity oil the black surface and graphite type carbon of cs6ca y contributed significantly to efficient photothermal conversion performance the reflection and transmission spectra of cs6ca y in the wavelength range of 200 2600 nm were measured fig s12 to obtain the absorbance and clarify the influence of carbonization on light absorption figs 7 a and s12a in the ultraviolet and visible regions the light absorption of cs6ca 200 and cs6ca 250 decreased to 70 whereas those of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 600 remained at 77 and 90 respectively on one hand the black surface and amorphous carbon were advantageous in terms of light absorption on the other hand the 3d cross linked pore structure could enhance absorption of incident light by reflecting it multiple times to further explore the photothermal conversion performance of cs6ca y an infrared thermal imager was used to record the real time temperature fields of the samples in air and floating on oil first the temperature changes of cs6ca y placed in air were measured under three illumination intensities of 0 5 sun 1 sun and 1 5 suns fig 7b a handmade foam container containing cs6ca y was used to prevent heat loss from the convective heat transfer as expected the higher the incident illumination intensity and carbonization degree the higher the sample surface temperature the standard deviation of the sample surface temperatures under all light intensities was 1 c the maximum surface temperatures of cs6ca 200 and cs6ca 250 could only reach 45 7 c and 56 c under 1 sun respectively fig s13 however the mean and maximum surface temperatures of cs6ca 300 increased to 60 c and 70 c within 20 s fig s15 respectively and reached the equilibrium state of approximately 70 c and 80 c within 1 min respectively it is equally important to test the photothermal conversion stability by constantly turning the simulated solar light source system on and off to evaluate whether the samples could rapidly reach a sufficient temperature during the recycling process as shown in fig 7c the mean and maximum temperatures on the upper surface of cs6ca 300 reached equilibrium within 1 min under 1 sun irradiation and stabilized at 70 c and 80 c in five cycles respectively and the surface temperature rapidly recovered to the initial state within 1 min of turning off the light cs6ca 350 also exhibited excellent photothermal conversion stability fig 7d infrared thermal images of the photothermal transformation stability of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 for five cycles are shown in figs 7e and s15 respectively in addition the shape and mechanical stability of cs6ca 300 remained excellent after solar assisted heating fig s14 providing an important basis for the absorption of high viscosity oil under sunlight cs6ca 300 in this work was compared with that in other literatures as shown in table 2 among biomass based absorbents cs6ca 300 has great competitiveness in absorption and photothermal properties chang et al 2018 chao et al 2020 kong et al 2022 singh and jelinek 2020 varshney et al 2022 wang et al 2022 wu et al 2020b yi et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 thermal conductivity is an important parameter that affects heat transfer and management the top surface of the aerogel captures the incident light and converts it into heat which is subsequently transferred to the bottom mainly by heat conduction thereby heating the surrounding oil a thermal analyzer was used to measure the thermal conductivities of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 at 60 c as indicated in table 1 the temperature variations of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 floating on the oil surface were measured under illumination intensities of 0 5 sun 1 sun and 1 5 suns the surface temperature had a positive linear correlation with the illumination intensity and carbonization temperature with a standard deviation of 1 c fig 8 a the ambient temperature was low during the experiment 5 c outdoors and approximately 15 c indoors air convection was generated near the samples to more realistically simulate the outdoor conditions of oil water separation compared to the samples placed in the foam container artificial air convection and the lack of foam protection caused the surface temperature to decrease by approximately 10 c as shown in fig 8b and 8c the solid liquid interface temperatures of cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 increased to 37 4 c and 45 c respectively and the large heat loss caused the subsequent temperature to change slowly oil viscosity is a pivotal parameter for determining the absorption rate gear oil 460 and vacuum pump oil were selected as representative oils and their viscosities at different temperatures were tested as shown in fig s16 illumination improved the absorption rate and capacity of cs6ca 300 this was because low viscosity oil can enter smaller pores more smoothly whereas high viscosity oil would be blocked in the orifice it could be inferred from fig s16 cs6ca 300 had the most rapid absorption rate for gear oil 460 compared to cs6ca 400 cs6ca 500 and cs6ca 600 although cs6ca 300 had relatively low absorbance apparent density and total pore capacity its 3d cross linked pore structure with low curvature and large pore diameter was beneficial for rapid and massive oil absorption to verify the above results and conjectures more intuitively 0 15 ml of gear oil was dropped on cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 and the absorption dynamics were qualitatively observed under 1 sun illumination fig 8e g simultaneously the absorption states of gear oil on cs6ca 300 without simulated solar illumination were recorded it took 2 days for cs6ca 300 without irradiation to completely absorb oil but only 7 min and 10 min for cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 respectively under 1 sun the temperature changes of the samples and oil droplets can be clearly observed in fig 8f and 8g the gear oil absorption and recovery performances of cs6ca 300 under 1 sun irradiation were quantitatively compared fig s17 in the absence of light the saturated absorption of gear oil was 39 g g 1 and 23 g g 1 of gear oil in total could be recovered after seven extrusions under 1 sun 44 g g 1 of gear oil was absorbed during the first absorption despite a 66 recovery rate during the first absorption the subsequent four recoveries were all comparable to the absorbed amount with recovery rates 80 after completely drying cs6ca 300 using isooctane to clean off the gear oil adhering to the skeleton the microstructures of the samples without compression with one compression and with five compressions after absorption were compared sem images fig s17 indicated that the samples in all three compression states maintained an intact pore structure and that only part of the striped skeleton was crushed after five compressions for cs6ca 300 3 4 removal of leaked crude oil and prospects for development to simulate real application scenarios more accurately the absorption capacity of cs6ca 300 was measured using crude oil as the absorbed object figs 9 and s18 first crude oil was dropped onto the aerogel surface at room temperature and the absorption speed was compared qualitatively with and without illumination when the ambient temperature was 20 c it took 42 min for cs6ca 300 to completely absorb the crude oil droplets on the surface without light cs6ca 300 absorbed the same mass of crude oil in only 10 s under 1 sun crude oil 56 g g 1 could be absorbed for the first time and 30 g g 1 of crude oil could be recovered stably by simple squeezing during the cycle when the crude oil was placed in a seawater environment salinity 3 5 wt temperature 4 c cs6ca 300 barely absorbed crude oil without light fig 9 movie s3 while the temperature of the crude oil around cs6ca 300 was increased to 25 c under 1 sun irradiation so that the crude oil had a higher fluidity and cs6ca 300 could be saturated within 10 min fig 9 movies s4 and s5 in summary solar assisted heating to reduce oil viscosity is a promising method for enhancing the heavy oil absorption rate and capacity the absorbent materials used in this study are rich in sources easy to prepare and have excellent oil absorption and recovery abilities in an actual complex environment this work provides a simple and environmentally friendly method for large scale production of high performance absorbents using biological resources and their application in the cleaning of actual polymorphic oil polluted water in future research the internal pores can be optimized in terms of modulation for example the verticality of internal pore channels can be further increased to enhance the oil absorption rate the mechanical strength and elasticity of the aerogel can be enhanced by constructing a lamellar structure and adding cross linking agents to improve cyclic utilization and recovery efficiency in terms of enhancing the mobility of crude oil in addition to the use of natural light artificial light sources can also be used for emergency treatment of oil contamination to recover the absorbent more rapidly after absorbing oil directional inducers can be added to the absorbent for controlled and efficient recovery of the absorbent such as magnetic and light driven materials moreover the utilized oil absorbing aerogels are expected to have secondary applications in other fields such as electrode materials through further carbonization or other treatments which can contribute to addressing problems caused by waste disposal 4 conclusion in this study hydrophobic and oleophilic 3d porous carbonized aerogels were synthesized via simple freeze drying low temperature carbonization and hydrophobic modification cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 exhibited excellent mechanical and thermal stability as well as excellent photothermal conversion performance because of ionic and chemical crosslinking from citric acid and carbonization as a result cs6ca 300 and cs6ca 350 demonstrated ultra high absorption capacities of up to 40 125 g g 1 with oil water separation efficiencies exceeding 99 and had excellent recycling abilities maintaining high absorption capacities after 10 cycles in addition the mean surface temperature of cs6ca 300 floating on the oil surface could exceed 60 c in a simulated environment with 1 sun illumination and cold air convection thus increasing the recovery rate of high viscosity oil considering the abundant sources and facile preparation method this work provides a novel avenue to manufacture high performance polymorphic oil absorbents from biological resources on a large

increasing yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 and the safe management of sludge is a substantial challenge due to the large volume yield potential environmental risk and high cost of treatments for sludges over 50 of the total cost of a wwtp wang et al 2018 biopolymers e g proteins polysaccharides and humic substances are rich in waste sludge as well a potential renewable and valuable biomass bank situmorang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 various advanced recycling technologies including anaerobic digestion aerobic composting and pyrolysis carbonization have been used to stabilize organic matter and kill pathogens in sludge satisfying the requirements of sludge land use and recycling xiao et al 2020 zhen et al 2017 for example anaerobic digestion technology has been widely used to convert biodegradable organic matter in sludge into valuable biogas and stable anaerobic digestate and pyrolysis carbonization converts sludge into composite carbon based products du et al 2022 hao et al 2020 the conversion and degradation efficiency of organic compounds in sludge treatments substantially rely on the amount and forms of organic matter in sludge thus a detailed understanding for the molecular composition and characteristics of dom in waste sludge is imperative to improve the efficiency of sludge resource utilization traditionally colorimetric and spectral techniques were mainly used to characterize organic matter in sludge ai et al 2019 xu et al 2018 the former measures the content of protein polysaccharide and humic acid but is easily interfered by the detection conditions such as the absence of suitable standard compounds and the cross interference of the many dom compounds in the individual assays resulting in certain biases in the quantitative results felz et al 2019 the latter can qualitatively characterize the main functional group structure of dom but cannot specifically analyze the complex composition of dom at a molecular level these lacking on the knowledge and understanding of the molecular composition of dom in sludge are not conducive to the development of highly effective sludge resource utilization electrospray spray ionization coupled with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms can provide unambiguous molecular formulas for complex dom matrices owing to its ultra high resolution and high mass accuracy mcdonough et al 2020 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b this high resolution technique has been widely used in the study of dom in water soil and sludge bahureksa et al 2021 faixo et al 2021 therefore studies have also applied esi ft icr ms to investigate the molecular characteristics of dom in sludge and its stabilized products to obtain useful information on molecular composition and transformation pathways of dom in sludge stabilization processes including pyrolysis carbonization aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion for instance du et al 2022 investigated the influence of pyrolysis temperature on the molecular composition and biotoxicity of dom in sludge based carbon via ft icr ms chen et al 2022 has also comparatively characterized the molecular composition of dom in aerobic composting sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge nevertheless dom in aqueous samples must be desalted and purified before ft icr ms measurement because the presence of metal ions and various inorganic salts can interfere with the accuracy of analytical results by forming miscellaneous peaks in the mass spectrograms and prevent the ionization of molecules in the esi source of mass spectrometers dittmar et al 2008 goranov et al 2022 several methods solid phase extraction spe procedures with ppl styrene divinyl benzene polymer c18 octadecyl hlb polystyrene divinylbenzene have been extensively employed for dom samples pretreatment including enrichment desalting and purification before ft icr ms detection li et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however some organic matter e g proteins and aromatic substances may undergo denaturation and precipitation in the acidification and elution processes and are difficult to recover owing to their chemical sensitivity and vulnerability ai et al 2019 chen et al 2016 this results in the loss of organic fractions during the pretreatment process affecting the comprehensive characterization and knowledge of original dom molecules in environmental samples therefore choosing an appropriate efficient preprocessing technique for dom in sludge before ft icr ms analysis is of great significance electrodialysis ed treatment an advanced pretreatment technique has been reportedly used for the efficient desalination of seawater samples and retains most of the dom components han et al 2016 huguet et al 2009 this phenomenon inspired the following hypothesis ed will achieve high recovery for dom in sludge samples in addition the selection of electrospray ionization esi modes of ft icr ms is essential for obtaining molecular composition information in dom samples gonsior et al 2014 xu et al 2020 it was reported that some dom molecules with acidic functional groups were identified because of their facile ionization and deprotonation in the negative esi esi mode ohno et al 2016 and the proteins with amide and amine structures in dom may be easily protonated and ionized in the positive esi esi mode he et al 2022 laszakovits et al 2020 due to high molecular complexity in sludge the single esi mode might not recognize all the dom via ft icr ms for example ohno et al 2016 found that the total assigned formulas in dom increased from 23 to 63 by using ft icr ms analysis with dual esi modes compared with single esi mode especially for dom samples rich in condensed aromatic and aromatic molecules laszakovits et al 2020 also highlighted multiple ionization techniques that enable a more detailed characterization of dom in drinking water however few studies have investigated the application of dual esi modes for understanding the molecular composition of sludge derived dom therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the organic matter recovery efficiency of pretreatment methods ed ppl and c18 on sludge derived dom 2 analyze the molecular composition of waste activated sludge was and anaerobic digestion sludge ads with esi ft icr ms operated with dual negative and positive esi modes and 3 identify and compare the molecular information of organic substances with high abundance in dom from was and ads the results of the study would provide significant guides for

performance criteria for automatic molecular formula matching were set as follows the relative error between the measured value and the matching value for any mass to charge ratio was less than 1 ppm and the peak height signal to noise ratio s n was 8 the molecular formula assignments were based on the following atomic numbers 12c1 50 1h4 110 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 31p0 1 35cl0 5 79br0 5 du et al 2022 lv et al 2016 detailed information is provided in si text s2 and tables s3 s4 fu et al 2020a 2020b 2022 2 5 other analysis and calculation the doc of sludge samples was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer teledyne tekmar dom solutions were analyzed with a ph meter mettler toled and an electrical conductivity ec meter a three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem was used to analyze the changes in fluorescence components in dom solution under different pretreatment methods gc ms agilent 7890a gc 5975c ms america characterization was used to further confirm the potential ecs types identified in sludge derived dom detailed parameters in si text s2 details for the organic matter recovery calculation are described in si text s3 thorsten dittmar 2008 in addition all the results of this study are presented as means standard deviation and pc1 pc2 80 in principal component correlation analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pretreatment on basic properties of sludge derived dom 3 1 1 dom recovery efficiency of different extraction methods as shown in fig 1 a and table s5 the recovery rate of dom pretreated with ed ppl and c18 was 74 4 98 9 38 6 44 8 and 4 0 8 7 and that of typical organic matters protein humic acid and polysaccharide by colorimetric method were 79 5 83 1 24 8 31 3 2 8 4 0 respectively in addition the fluorescent spectra text s4 and fig 1 b showed that three typical fluorescence peaks related to tyrosine λex em 220 nm 350 nm tryptophan λex em 280 nm 350 nm proteins and humic acid like substances λex em 310 nm 385 nm were retained in dom pretreated with ed the intensity of fluorescence signals located at λex em 310 nm 385 nm peak c were reduced or disappeared after being pretreated with ppl and c18 and the fluorescence peak related to humic acid like substances such as peak d λex em 260 nm 430 nm was greatly enhanced therefore spe cartridges including c18 and ppl pretreatment showed a specific selectivity for organic substances which might affect the characterization and understanding of factual dom in sludge samples by contrast the fluorescent fraction of dom samples pretreated with ed was rarely affected in summary ed pretreatment did efficiently recover organic matter components in sludge 3 1 2 effects of purification pretreatment on dom molecular characteristics esi ft icr ms was used to determine the detailed molecular composition in dom pretreated with ed ppl and c18 from the mass spectra of dom samples fig s2 thousands of unique molecular formulas were identified by assigning molecular formulas to each peak where the mass spectrum peaks of the dom samples pretreated with ed showed a near normal distribution this result implied that the ed pretreatment provides a more plentiful dom matrix for ft icr ms detection than spe methods the mws of domwas pretreated with ed were primarily distributed in the range of 400 900 da with 43 0 above 600 da whereas that of domwas pretreated with ppl c18 were concentrated in the range of 200 700 da of which 27 3 29 4 were higher than 600 da fig s3 in other words the macromolecular substances in dom samples could be retained more effectively under ed pretreatment than that of conventional spe columns i e ppl and c18 for domads their mws mainly ranged from 200 da to 700 da consistent with du and li 2017 generally the high mw of biopolymers in was are metabolized and converted into small molecules by microorganisms during anaerobic digestion hao et al 2020 potentially improving the recovery of dom in the methanol elution step of spe notably the numbers of assigned elemental formulas in the dom pretreated with ed were typically less than those of the spe columns this finding likely occurred because the partial biopolymers in recovered dom with high mw were beyond the detection limit of ft icr ms which requires further exploration and optimization of the ft icr ms detection method for sludge derived dom according to the elemental composition the identified molecular formulas can be divided into five formula classes as depicted in fig 2 b the major fractions of domwas pretreated with ed were n free formulas 61 60 89 88 such cho chos and p containing substances chop chonp chosp chonsp which differed from domads dominated by n containing formulas 71 02 77 36 for dom pretreated with ppl and c18 the assigned molecules were mainly chon s and chos compounds furthermore based on the molar ratio of the h c and o c of typical biogeochemical compounds dom molecules also can be classified into eight classes fig 2 a b sunghwan kim 2003 among those classes domwas pretreated with three methods ed ppl and c18 shared some similarities in their molecular composition mainly distributed in the lipids region followed by protein aliphatic and lignins carboxylic rich alicyclic molecule cram like regions whereas lignins cram like and protein aliphatic were rich in domads pretreated with ed and ppl du and li 2017 hao et al 2020 which differed from domads pretreated with c18 mainly composed of lipid substances dom extraction and the purification pretreatment method had significant effects on the molecular composition of dom in other words the pretreated domwas ads with c18 greatly underestimated the molecular diversity of sludge derived dom leading to a misunderstanding of their molecular characteristics significant differences were also observed using the common venn diagrams of the number of molecules identified by different pretreatment methods as shown in fig 2 c and fig s4 a comprehensive comparison and screening of the molecular formula identified by three pretreatment methods ed ppl c18 showed that the proportion of common molecules was relatively low and the higher proportions were unique molecules identified by each method which also meant that the three pretreatment methods have specific selectivity for dom molecules recognition the double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon dbe o c and the nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc were used to reflect the degree of unsaturation and redox state respectively brooker et al 2018 phungsai et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a generally the larger positive value of dbe o c represents the higher degree of unsaturation and the higher positive value of nosc implies the higher oxidized state the recognized molecules in dom were divided into four classes unsaturated and oxidized compounds dbe o c 0 nosc 0 unsaturated and reduced compounds dbe o c 0 nosc 0 saturated and reduced compounds dbe o c 0 nosc 0 and saturated and oxidized compounds dbe o c 0 nosc 0 based on the positive and negative values of dbe o c and nosc detailed parameters shown in text s2 as shown in fig 3 c the sludge derived dom molecules pretreated with ed ppl were all concentrated in a reduced state e g double bonds triple bonds aromatic hydrocarbons or amino groups among which the saturated species were more abundant than the unsaturated species by contrast dom pretreated with c18 contained a high proportion of molecules in the oxidation state region 3 2 effect of electrospray ionization modes on dom characterization for the evaluation of the selectivity of the ion mode for sludge derived dom characterization esi mode and esi mode were applied to recognize the composition of dom respectively fig s2 although dom obtained by different ionization modes exhibited similar mass to charge ratio distributions the relative peak intensity of esi mode was significantly higher than that of esi mode and the mass spectrum peak distribution of esi mode was closer to the normal distribution a likely outcome was that esi mode could ionize only a fraction of acidic and or nonaromatic compounds and was not favorable for the recognition of nitrogen containing organic groups e g amines amides heterocyclic compounds and nitrile he et al 2022 laszakovits et al 2020 therefore it should be noted that the detectability of dom components is affected by ionization efficiency if few components have high ionization efficiency the ionization of other components might be suppressed additionally from the perspective of mws esi mode mainly focused on the recognition of substances of mws less than 600 da and esi mode presented strong recognition for molecules larger than 600 da meaning that the combination of dual ion modes could identify dom molecules more comprehensively fig s3 the kmd maps were made with chon substances which accounted for the main components in sludge dom this study demonstrated that under the same c atom number and kmd value the number of identified substances in esi mode was significantly higher than in esi mode and the specific identification formula is shown in fig 3 a b the substances such as c21h43no3 7 c24h44n2o11 13 detected in esi mode could not be identified in esi mode which confirmed that the single esi mode showed limitations regarding understanding molecular characteristics of sludge dom thus it is verified that esi mode mentioned above has poor ionization efficiency for chon compounds such as amines which is consistent with the research results of he and li he et al 2022 li et al 2022 the nosc dbe o c maps fig 3 c suggested that the dual esi modes showed a complementary trend in substance recognition which is also supported by previous results of mass spectrometry base targeted analysis he et al 2022 li et al 2022 positive negative esi mode mainly focused on identifying reduced substances nosc 0 for oxidized substances nosc 0 their recognition by different esi modes leads to increased differences under different pretreatment methods dom samples pretreated with ppl ed were mainly identified by esi mode and samples pretreated with c18 were primarily recognized by esi mode the effects of two esi modes on the molecular composition of sludge derived dom were compared the analysis of the relative abundance plots of elemental and material composition fig 2 b showed that the total ratio of p containing compounds in dom detected by esi mode was approximately 2 13 fold that of esi mode the substance diversity was also similar unsaturated hydrocarbons were almost more readily identified in esi mode than in esi mode in addition the addition of esi mode resulted in a more than 2 fold increase in the total number of identified dom molecules over the traditional mode of using esi mode alone table s6 overall different esi modes exhibited corresponding selectivity for dom molecules therefore for the characterization of sludge derived dom the choice of esi mode should be tailored to fulfill the research purposes cover the desired compound classes and avoid incorrect interpretations from a single ionization source 3 3 molecular formulas analysis of sludge derived dom 3 3 1 number of atoms of oxygen nitrogen and sulfur in dom unlike cho chon in soil or water chon chos in sludge derived dom is the main component han et al 2022 li et al 2018b the properties of molecules pretreated with ed ppl and c18 under different ion modes were reflected the relative abundance plots of atomic numbers were described based on three classes chon cho and chos in domads pretreated with ed the predominant nxo molecules organic compounds containing x nitrogen atoms measured by esi mode were n1o n2o and n3o classes and the main compounds measured by esi mode were n2o n3o and n4o classes fig 4 a and fig s6 respectively additionally n3o class was the most abundant molecule in both modes esi and esi to improve the understanding of the properties of dom in table s7 this study summarized the molecular formulas of the top ten substances in the abundance of each sample additionally the typical similarities and differences in molecules under various pretreatment methods were screened out fig 4 b c molecular formulas were input into the chemspider database for matching and molecular structures were screened based on the van krevelen partitions table s8 13 listed the possible structures of the top ten highly abundant organic compounds in domads along with the number of isomers for each possible molecular structure domwas was mostly repeated with domads thus the structural formulas were not listed in accordance with the screening structure the most abundant n3o class compounds in dual esi modes mainly corresponded to amide valine and other compounds for example n 2s 2 n acetyl l serine amino butyryl l valine n1o class was the main compound in domads pretreated with ppl and c18 the majority of these substances could be ecs including surfactants and plasticizers clara et al 2010 wei et al 2021 in domwas ed the major identified chon compounds were n3o and n5o classes under esi mode n3o n4o and n5o classes were detected under esi mode the main compounds identified by domwas pretreated with ppl and c18 were identical to those in domads which was attributed to the n1o class thus the pretreatment with ppl and c18 focused on identifying n1o classes compounds and ed pretreatment retained a higher molecular weight of substances n3o classes in chon compounds than ppl and c18 did in the cho compounds of domwas ads ox classes x 1 15 the number range of oxygen atoms pretreated with ppl c18 ed methods were o2 o12 classes the screening demonstrated that the o4 and o5 classes might be related to soluble microbial metabolites e g hydroxy fatty acids and ecs e g dioctyl terephthalate and dibutyl phthalate bayabil et al 2022 notably ppl pretreatment had higher recognition abundance for o12 o14 classes compounds in domads under esi mode which were probably methyl 3 6 deoxy α d xylo hexopyranosyl 1 3 α d galactopyranosyl 1 2 α d mannopyranoside and other carbohydrates however the main cho compounds of domwas identified under esi mode were o11 and o12 classes which contained n octyl β d maltoside an oxygenated heterocyclic compound the identified substances in esi mode were mainly o2 class and contained saturated higher fatty acids such as n hexadecanoic acid li et al 2018a more notably the cho compounds of was may be transformed from organic compounds with 2 4 nitrogen atoms to higher oxygen species after anaerobic digestion the sulfur containing compounds with the largest proportion in the two types of sludge were s1o class and most of them were related to alkylbenzene sulfonic acids wu et al 2021 the representative of dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid could be an anionic surfactant used as the raw material of various detergents e g shampoo and detergent gonsior et al 2011 found that chos compounds in municipal wastewater might be mainly attributed to anionic surfactants used as domestic detergents 3 3 2 screening of highly abundant substances between positive and negative ion recognition of sludge derived dom the molecular formulas of the top ten substances in the dom of sludge pretreated with ppl c18 ed in the dual ion modes are listed in si table s7 lignins crams and n containing free saturated compounds were the main components of domads hao et al 2020 in domwas the n containing free saturated compounds corresponding to proteins lipids and other substances in was accounted for the highest abundance additionally esi mode mainly focused on the recognition of cho and chon compounds and esi mode mostly recognized the chos compounds in sludge derived dom samples moreover the identified substances could be divided into two categories biogenic substances e g dissolved microbial metabolites and ecs checked using the chemspider database soluble microbial products are the main organic components in wastewater biological treatment among which diketopromazine dkps and hydroxyl fatty acids are representative substances which is consistent with the study of du et al 2022 substances identified as possible ecs include personal care products phthalates organic nanoparticles and surfactants which are commonly derived from household urban and industrial wastewater rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 tadeo et al 2012 as shown in fig 4 a c substances such as c19h32o3s and c18h30o3s were identified in both the domwas and domads samples which was probably related to alkylbenzene sulfonic acid groups in surfactants emulsifiers detergents and other daily necessities due to the poor biodegradability of these ecs petrie et al 2015 in the top ten substances with the highest abundance identified by ft icr ms using three pretreatment methods nearly 80 might be related to ecs additionally gc ms characterization was applied to further confirm the potential ecs types identified in sludge derived dom as shown in table s14 the phthalic acid di oct 3 yl ester dimethyl phthalate methyl stearate and other esters n hexadecanoic acid other saturated higher fatty acids and alkanols n pentadecanol could be detected in dom pretreated with ed but fewer substances than that were recognized in dom pretreated with ppl c18 moreover some might be plasticizers such as dioctyl terephthalate dop and dibutyl phthalate dbp can persist and be retained in sludge however the spe cartridges are mainly used for the enrichment of cyclododecane acetamide butyronitrile acetonitrile propionitrile and other substances 3 4 correlation statistical analysis of averaged mass spectral parameters in the ensuing discussion multivariate statistics were applied to examine and compare the compositional nature of the dom isolated by different pretreatment methods to evaluate the relevance and assist in data interpretation table s15 shows the calculated parameters for each sample and these values are used for principal component analysis pca and hierarchal cluster analysis hca pca was applied to determine the leading parameters in correlation with the corresponding sample groups rachel l sleighter 2010 this approach examined the overall nature of molecular formulas assigned to mass spectra of many samples and identified the similarities and differences between compound types in the dom samples as discussed in text s5 the pc1 pc2 of each subsample was 80 thus the linear relationship between variables was a reasonable assumption in pca additionally pc1 explained nearly 70 of the variance in samples related to their aromaticity fig 5 a dom samples with higher aromaticity i e higher dbewa and dbe cwa values had positive pc1 scores and the samples with higher aliphatic content i e higher h cwa values had negative pc1 scores as shown in fig 5 a there were no obvious differences in the properties of domwas pretreated with ed ppl and c18 in which most of them were located at pc1 0 however in domads the molecular properties of recognized molecules pretreated with ed and ppl were similar pc1 0 and that pretreated with c18 was different pc1 0 the samples of domads pretreated with both ppl and ed had positive pc1 scores due to the effective enrichment of the lignins of sludge derived dom the pc1 score of dom samples pretreated with c18 was negative indicating that they had a high aliphatic content fig 5 b shows the resulting dendrogram based on the parameters in table s15 samples cluster together based on their correlation value r the dendrogram explained that for all sludge derived dom samples the molecular properties clusters pretreated with ed and ppl methods in the same ion mode were significantly similar r 0 99 the clustering between different ion modes was 0 70 0 93 thus there were certain differences in the identification of substances confirming the superiority of dual esi modes for dom characterization over single esi mode 3 5 environmental application in this study a more effective method of ed for the sludge derived dom extraction was established compared with traditional solid phase extraction columns ppl and c18 ed had the advantages of high organic matter recovery low costly and large processing capacity making it the most innovative and practical pretreatment method for bulk sludge derived dom in ft icr ms analysis of sludge derived dom a reasonable analysis mode esi and esi modes was selected based on a clear research purpose to improve the accuracy of the description for the molecular characteristics and chemodiversity of sludge derived dom this result strongly supports subsequent studies of the molecular composition of dom derived from sludge in addition to this we also established an internal standard calibration method for exclusive sludge derived dom because it cannot be accurately calibrated using natural water internal standards in this study according to the comparison and analysis of the substances identified by the three pretreatment methods ed pretreatment not only had the highest degree of organic matter retention and more representative in sludge derived dom but also performed a satisfactory identification effect on substances that may be ecs consequently the dom extraction and analysis methods proposed in this work effectively identify the substances that may be ecs in sludge and provide a valuable reference for the subsequent utilization of organic matter in sludge resources 4 conclusions in this work a novel and more effective pretreatment method ed than spe methods was proposed for resolving the dom of sludge by using high resolution mass spectrometry and the molecular composition of sludge derived dom was further analyzed based on proving the superiority of the combination of positive and negative ion modes the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 because of the recovery of organic matter ed 70 95 the impact on functional group structure viability timeliness ed is an efficient economical pretreatment method for sludge derived dom 2 molecular properties and compositions pretreated with ppl and ed were substantially similar protein lipids and lignins were the main substances proved by pca and hca correlation r 0 99 3 the addition of esi mode increased the number of recognized molecules by over 2 fold and provided a more comprehensive range of the elements composition the number of assignments for the unsaturated hydrocarbons and n containing saturated compounds in the esi mode was increased which was probably due to the presence of aromatic dom molecules that suppressed the ionization of these entities in esi mode thus improved characterization of dom is possible through the dual ion modes for ft icr ms analysis especially for samples rich in condensed aromatic and aromatic molecules 4 dissolved microbial metabolites e g dkps hydroxyl fatty acids and ecs e g surfactants and plasticizers could be mainly substances by using ft icr ms and gc ms ecs were identified in dom due to their high stability in sewage sludge and accounted for more than 80 of the top ten substances with high abundance this work enriches the understanding of the molecular characteristics of sludge derived dom and provides reference value for the subsequent efficient safe utilization of sludge

15057,high resolution mass spectrometry was extensively applied in molecular composition and transformation pathways of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater sludge treatments sample pretreatment

polymer ppl octadecyl c18 and electrodialysis ed on molecular characteristics of dom in two typical wastewater sludges waste activated sludge was and anaerobic digestion sludge ads analyzed by ft icr

recovering the different sludge derived dom with a high similarity of molecular characteristics e g lipids proteins aliphatic and lignins cram like and the c18 method was ineffective in extracting carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons and amino sugars in addition compared with single esi analysis mode the molecular number identified by esi analysis mode was increased by 200 especially more unsaturated hydrocarbons and n containing compounds were detected except for biogenic dom plenty of emerging containments ecs in sludge derived dom were identified esi mode was more effectively in recognizing the alkyl benzene sulfonic acids e g anionic surfactants and esi mode was more effectively for plasticizers identification for example dioctyl terephthalate and dibutyl phthalate this study illustrated that ed pretreatment coupled with ft icr ms in dual esi modes could give more insights in complexed molecular information for dom in wastewater sludge and provides a theoretical

increasing yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 and the safe management of sludge is a substantial challenge due to the large volume yield potential environmental risk and high cost of treatments for sludges over 50 of the total cost of a wwtp wang et al 2018 biopolymers e g proteins polysaccharides and humic substances are rich in waste sludge as well a potential renewable and valuable biomass bank situmorang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 various advanced recycling technologies including anaerobic digestion aerobic composting and pyrolysis carbonization have been used to stabilize organic matter and kill pathogens in sludge satisfying the requirements of sludge land use and recycling xiao et al 2020 zhen et al 2017 for example anaerobic digestion technology has been widely used to convert biodegradable organic matter in sludge into valuable biogas and stable anaerobic digestate and pyrolysis carbonization converts sludge into composite carbon based products du et al 2022 hao et al 2020 the conversion and degradation efficiency of organic compounds in sludge treatments substantially rely on the amount and forms of organic matter in sludge thus a detailed understanding for the molecular composition and characteristics of dom in waste sludge is imperative to improve the efficiency of sludge resource utilization traditionally colorimetric and spectral techniques were mainly used to characterize organic matter in sludge ai et al 2019 xu et al 2018 the former measures the content of protein polysaccharide and humic acid but is easily interfered by the detection conditions such as the absence of suitable standard compounds and the cross interference of the many dom compounds in the individual assays resulting in certain biases in the quantitative results felz et al 2019 the latter can qualitatively characterize the main functional group structure of dom but cannot specifically analyze the complex composition of dom at a molecular level these lacking on the knowledge and understanding of the molecular composition of dom in sludge are not conducive to the development of highly effective sludge resource utilization electrospray spray ionization coupled with fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms can provide unambiguous molecular formulas for complex dom matrices owing to its ultra high resolution and high mass accuracy mcdonough et al 2020 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b this high resolution technique has been widely used in the study of dom in water soil and sludge bahureksa et al 2021 faixo et al 2021 therefore studies have also applied esi ft icr ms to investigate the molecular characteristics of dom in sludge and its stabilized products to obtain useful information on molecular composition and transformation pathways of dom in sludge stabilization processes including pyrolysis carbonization aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion for instance du et al 2022 investigated the influence of pyrolysis temperature on the molecular composition and biotoxicity of dom in sludge based carbon via ft icr ms chen et al 2022 has also comparatively characterized the molecular composition of dom in aerobic composting sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge nevertheless dom in aqueous samples must be desalted and purified before ft icr ms measurement because the presence of metal ions and various inorganic salts can interfere with the accuracy of analytical results by forming miscellaneous peaks in the mass spectrograms and prevent the ionization of molecules in the esi source of mass spectrometers dittmar et al 2008 goranov et al 2022 several methods solid phase extraction spe procedures with ppl styrene divinyl benzene polymer c18 octadecyl hlb polystyrene divinylbenzene have been extensively employed for dom samples pretreatment including enrichment desalting and purification before ft icr ms detection li et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however some organic matter e g proteins and aromatic substances may undergo denaturation and precipitation in the acidification and elution processes and are difficult to recover owing to their chemical sensitivity and vulnerability ai et al 2019 chen et al 2016 this results in the loss of organic fractions during the pretreatment process affecting the comprehensive characterization and knowledge of original dom molecules in environmental samples therefore choosing an appropriate efficient preprocessing technique for dom in sludge before ft icr ms analysis is of great significance electrodialysis ed treatment an advanced pretreatment technique has been reportedly used for the efficient desalination of seawater samples and retains most of the dom components han et al 2016 huguet et al 2009 this phenomenon inspired the following hypothesis ed will achieve high recovery for dom in sludge samples in addition the selection of electrospray ionization esi modes of ft icr ms is essential for obtaining molecular composition information in dom samples gonsior et al 2014 xu et al 2020 it was reported that some dom molecules with acidic functional groups were identified because of their facile ionization and deprotonation in the negative esi esi mode ohno et al 2016 and the proteins with amide and amine structures in dom may be easily protonated and ionized in the positive esi esi mode he et al 2022 laszakovits et al 2020 due to high molecular complexity in sludge the single esi mode might not recognize all the dom via ft icr ms for example ohno et al 2016 found that the total assigned formulas in dom increased from 23 to 63 by using ft icr ms analysis with dual esi modes compared with single esi mode especially for dom samples rich in condensed aromatic and aromatic molecules laszakovits et al 2020 also highlighted multiple ionization techniques that enable a more detailed characterization of dom in drinking water however few studies have investigated the application of dual esi modes for understanding the molecular composition of sludge derived dom therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the organic matter recovery efficiency of pretreatment methods ed ppl and c18 on sludge derived dom 2 analyze the molecular composition of waste activated sludge was and anaerobic digestion sludge ads with esi ft icr ms operated with dual negative and positive esi modes and 3 identify and compare the molecular information of organic substances with high abundance in dom from was and ads the results of the study would provide significant guides for studying molecular compositions and transformation pathways of dom in sludge treatments and optimize the technologies operation conditions for sludge disposal 2 materials and methods 2 1 samples and

extracted efficiently in a micro hydrothermal reactor 500 ml via a low temperature alkali hydrothermal strategy mohammad mirsoleimani azizi et al 2021 xiao et al 2017 in brief the ph of was or ads were adjusted to 12 using naoh 1 mol l and transferred into the micro hydrothermal reactor before starting the reaction the reactor was saturated with n2 for 5 min to remove the air sludge samples were heated in a hydrothermal reactor at 100 c for 60 min with a stirring speed of 500 rpm and a heating rate of 2 3 c min the supernatant of sludge was separated via a centrifugation process 6000 g for 10 min and filtrated by a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane chuangwei filtration equipment factory zhejiang china the obtained samples were stored at 4 c before the subsequent experiments and labeled as domwas and domads respectively 2 3 extraction of sludge derived dom 2 3 1 electrodialysis pretreatment in electrodialysis ed anions and cations are selectively permeated through an ion exchange

bond elut ppl cartridges 500 mg per 6 ml specifically samples were first acidified by hydrochloric acid hcl 1 mol l to ph 2 0 to improve the recovery of phenolic and carboxylic substances han et al 2022 notably the solution was diluted to 2 3 mg dissolved organic carbon doc l to avoid protein precipitation in dom stücheli et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the acidified samples were pumped at 3 ml min through the cartridges which had been pre activated with 18 ml methanol lc ms grade and 18 ml acidified ultrapure water ph 2 0 next the cartridges were rinsed with 30 ml acidified ultrapure water to remove the residual salts dried with a stream of n2 and immediately eluted by 6 ml methanol to recover dom the eluted samples were blow dried with n2 and redissolved in 1 3 ml 1 1 methanol water v v solution of which 1 ml was used for esi ft icr ms analysis and the remaining 0 3 ml was used to calculate the doc recovery rate from solid phase extraction cartridges c18 spe extraction was performed using the same procedure as that for the ppl pretreatment 2 4 molecular composition analysis of dom high field fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectra were acquired using a 15 0 t bruker solarix mass spectrometer bruker daltonics bremen germany and an apollo ii esi source in positive and negative ionization modes respectively the range of m z was set from 100 to 1000 spectra were externally calibrated with 10 mmol l sodium formate solution in 50 isopropyl alcohol by a linear calibration due to the poor applicability of the commonly used internal standard calibration method to sludge derived dom a special internal standard calibration method was developed for sludge derived dom in brief polyethylene glycol peg standard products with different molecular weights mws average mw 200 300 400 600 800 1000 g mol were added into methanol to prepare the internal standard solution final peg concentration 0 012 mg ml goranov et al 2022 extracted dom samples were diluted with a methanol solution containing internal standard peg for detection as in xu et al 2020 all formulas were assigned an in house matlab algorithm named nomdbp created by fu et al 2020a the performance criteria for automatic molecular formula matching were set as follows the relative error between the measured value and the matching value for any mass to charge ratio was less than 1 ppm and the peak height signal to noise ratio s n was 8 the molecular formula assignments were based on the following atomic numbers 12c1 50 1h4 110 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 31p0 1 35cl0 5 79br0 5 du et al 2022 lv et al 2016 detailed information is provided in si text s2 and tables s3 s4 fu et al 2020a 2020b 2022 2 5 other analysis and calculation the doc of sludge samples was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer teledyne tekmar dom solutions were analyzed with a ph meter mettler toled and an electrical conductivity ec meter a three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem was used to analyze the changes in fluorescence components in dom solution under different pretreatment methods gc ms agilent 7890a gc 5975c ms america characterization was used to further confirm the potential ecs types identified in sludge derived dom detailed parameters in si text s2 details for the organic matter recovery calculation are described in si text s3 thorsten dittmar 2008 in addition all the results of this study are presented as means standard deviation and pc1 pc2 80 in principal component correlation analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pretreatment on basic properties of sludge derived dom 3 1 1 dom recovery efficiency of different extraction methods as shown in fig 1 a and table s5 the recovery rate of dom pretreated with ed ppl and c18 was 74 4 98 9 38 6 44 8 and 4 0 8 7 and that of typical organic matters protein humic acid and polysaccharide by colorimetric method were 79 5 83 1 24 8 31 3 2 8 4 0 respectively in addition the fluorescent spectra text s4 and fig 1 b showed that three typical fluorescence peaks related to tyrosine λex em 220 nm 350 nm tryptophan λex em 280 nm 350 nm proteins and humic acid like substances λex em 310 nm 385 nm were retained in dom pretreated with ed the intensity of fluorescence signals located at λex em 310 nm 385 nm peak c were reduced or disappeared after being pretreated with ppl and c18 and the fluorescence peak related to humic acid like substances such as peak d λex em 260 nm 430 nm was greatly enhanced therefore spe cartridges including c18 and ppl pretreatment showed a specific selectivity for organic substances which might affect the characterization and understanding of factual dom in sludge samples by contrast the fluorescent fraction of dom samples pretreated with ed was rarely affected in summary ed pretreatment did efficiently recover organic matter components in sludge 3 1 2 effects of purification pretreatment on dom molecular characteristics esi ft icr ms was used to determine the detailed molecular composition in dom pretreated with ed ppl and c18 from the mass spectra of dom samples fig s2 thousands of unique molecular formulas were identified by assigning molecular formulas to each peak where the mass spectrum peaks of the dom samples pretreated with ed showed a near normal distribution this result implied that the ed pretreatment provides a more plentiful dom matrix for ft icr ms detection than spe methods the mws of domwas pretreated with ed were primarily distributed in the range of 400 900 da with 43 0 above 600 da whereas that of domwas pretreated with ppl c18 were concentrated in the range of 200 700 da of which 27 3 29 4 were higher than 600 da fig s3 in other words the macromolecular substances in dom samples could be retained more effectively under ed pretreatment than that of conventional spe columns i e ppl and c18 for domads their mws mainly ranged from 200 da to 700 da consistent with du and li 2017 generally the high mw of biopolymers in was are metabolized and converted into small molecules by microorganisms during anaerobic digestion hao et al 2020 potentially improving the recovery of dom in the methanol elution step of spe notably the numbers of assigned elemental formulas in the dom pretreated with ed were typically less than those of the spe columns this finding likely occurred because the partial biopolymers in recovered dom with high mw were beyond the detection limit of ft icr ms which requires further exploration and optimization of the ft icr ms detection method for sludge derived dom according to the elemental composition the identified molecular formulas can be divided into five formula classes as depicted in fig 2 b the major fractions of domwas pretreated with ed were n free formulas 61 60 89 88 such cho chos and p containing substances chop chonp chosp chonsp which differed from domads dominated by n containing formulas 71 02 77 36 for dom pretreated with ppl and c18 the assigned molecules were mainly chon s and chos compounds furthermore based on the molar ratio of the h c and o c of typical biogeochemical compounds dom molecules also can be classified into eight classes fig 2 a b sunghwan kim 2003 among those classes domwas pretreated with three methods ed ppl and c18 shared some similarities in their molecular composition mainly distributed in the lipids region followed by protein aliphatic and lignins carboxylic rich alicyclic molecule cram like regions whereas lignins cram like and protein aliphatic were rich in domads pretreated with ed and ppl du and li 2017 hao et al 2020 which differed from domads pretreated with c18 mainly composed of lipid substances dom extraction and the purification pretreatment method had significant effects on the molecular composition of dom in other words the pretreated domwas ads with c18 greatly underestimated the molecular diversity of sludge derived dom leading to a misunderstanding of their molecular characteristics significant differences were also observed using the common venn diagrams of the number of molecules identified by different pretreatment methods as shown in fig 2 c and fig s4 a comprehensive comparison and screening of the molecular formula identified by three pretreatment methods ed ppl c18 showed that the proportion of common molecules was relatively low and the higher proportions were unique molecules identified by each method which also meant that the three pretreatment methods have specific selectivity for dom molecules recognition the double bond equivalent minus oxygen per carbon dbe o c and the nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc were used to reflect the degree of unsaturation and redox state respectively brooker et al 2018 phungsai et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a generally the larger positive value of dbe o c represents the higher degree of unsaturation and the higher positive value of nosc implies the higher oxidized state the recognized molecules in dom were divided into four classes unsaturated and oxidized compounds dbe o c 0 nosc 0 unsaturated and reduced compounds dbe o c 0 nosc 0 saturated and reduced compounds dbe o c 0 nosc 0 and saturated and oxidized compounds dbe o c 0 nosc 0 based on the positive and negative values of dbe o c and nosc detailed parameters shown in text s2 as shown in fig 3 c the sludge derived dom molecules pretreated with ed ppl were all concentrated in a reduced state e g double bonds triple bonds aromatic hydrocarbons or amino groups among which the saturated species were more abundant than the unsaturated species by contrast dom pretreated with c18 contained a high proportion of molecules in the oxidation state region 3 2 effect of electrospray ionization modes on dom characterization for the evaluation of the selectivity of the ion mode for sludge derived dom characterization esi mode and esi mode were applied to recognize the composition of dom respectively fig s2 although dom obtained by different ionization modes exhibited similar mass to charge ratio distributions the relative peak intensity of esi mode was significantly higher than that of esi mode and the mass spectrum peak distribution of esi mode was closer to the normal distribution a likely outcome was that esi mode could ionize only a fraction of acidic and or nonaromatic compounds and was not favorable for the recognition of nitrogen containing organic groups e g amines amides heterocyclic compounds and nitrile he et al 2022 laszakovits et al 2020 therefore it should be noted that the detectability of dom components is affected by ionization efficiency if few components have high ionization efficiency the ionization of other components might be suppressed additionally from the perspective of mws esi mode mainly focused on the recognition of substances of mws less than 600 da and esi mode presented strong recognition for molecules larger than 600 da meaning that the combination of dual ion modes could identify dom molecules more comprehensively fig s3 the kmd maps were made with chon substances which accounted for the main components in sludge dom this study demonstrated that under the same c atom number and kmd value the number of identified substances in esi mode was significantly higher than in esi mode and the specific identification formula is shown in fig 3 a b the substances such as c21h43no3 7 c24h44n2o11 13 detected in esi mode could not be identified in esi mode which confirmed that the single esi mode showed limitations regarding understanding molecular characteristics of sludge dom thus it is verified that esi mode mentioned above has poor ionization efficiency for chon compounds such as amines which is consistent with the research results of he and li he et al 2022 li et al 2022 the nosc dbe o c maps fig 3 c suggested that the dual esi modes showed a complementary trend in substance recognition which is also supported by previous results of mass spectrometry base targeted analysis he et al 2022 li et al 2022 positive negative esi mode mainly focused on identifying reduced substances nosc 0 for oxidized substances nosc 0 their recognition by different esi modes leads to increased differences under different pretreatment methods dom samples pretreated with ppl ed were mainly identified by esi mode and samples pretreated with c18 were primarily recognized by esi mode the effects of two esi modes on the molecular composition of sludge derived dom were compared the analysis of the relative abundance plots of elemental and material composition fig 2 b showed that the total ratio of p containing compounds in dom detected by esi mode was approximately 2 13 fold that of esi mode the substance diversity was also similar unsaturated hydrocarbons were almost more readily identified in esi mode than in esi mode in addition the addition of esi mode resulted in a more than 2 fold increase in the total number of identified dom molecules over the traditional mode of using esi mode alone table s6 overall different esi modes exhibited corresponding selectivity for dom molecules therefore for the characterization of sludge derived dom the choice of esi mode should be tailored to fulfill the research purposes cover the desired compound classes and avoid incorrect interpretations from a single ionization source 3 3 molecular formulas analysis of sludge derived dom 3 3 1 number of atoms of oxygen nitrogen and sulfur in dom unlike cho chon in soil or water chon chos in sludge derived dom is the main component han et al 2022 li et al 2018b the properties of molecules pretreated with ed ppl and c18 under different ion modes were reflected the relative abundance plots of atomic numbers were described based on three classes chon cho and chos in domads pretreated with ed the predominant nxo molecules organic compounds containing x nitrogen atoms measured by esi mode were n1o n2o and n3o classes and the main compounds measured by esi mode were n2o n3o and n4o classes fig 4 a and fig s6 respectively additionally n3o class was the most abundant molecule in both modes esi and esi to improve the understanding of the properties of dom in table s7 this study summarized the molecular formulas of the top ten substances in the abundance of each sample additionally the typical similarities and differences in molecules under various pretreatment methods were screened out fig 4 b c molecular formulas were input into the chemspider database for matching and molecular structures were screened based on the van krevelen partitions table s8 13 listed the possible structures of the top ten highly abundant organic compounds in domads along with the number of isomers for each possible molecular structure domwas was mostly repeated with domads thus the structural formulas were not listed in accordance with the screening structure the most abundant n3o class compounds in dual esi modes mainly corresponded to amide valine and other compounds for example n 2s 2 n acetyl l serine amino butyryl l valine n1o class was the main compound in domads pretreated with ppl and c18 the majority of these substances could be ecs including surfactants and plasticizers clara et al 2010 wei et al 2021 in domwas ed the major identified chon compounds were n3o and n5o classes under esi mode n3o n4o and n5o classes were detected under esi mode the main compounds identified by domwas pretreated with ppl and c18 were identical to those in domads which was attributed to the n1o class thus the pretreatment with ppl and c18 focused on identifying n1o classes compounds and ed pretreatment retained a higher molecular weight of substances n3o classes in chon compounds than ppl and c18 did in the cho compounds of domwas ads ox classes x 1 15 the number range of oxygen atoms pretreated with ppl c18 ed methods were o2 o12 classes the screening demonstrated that the o4 and o5 classes might be related to soluble microbial metabolites e g hydroxy fatty acids and ecs e g dioctyl terephthalate and dibutyl phthalate bayabil et al 2022 notably ppl pretreatment had higher recognition abundance for o12 o14 classes compounds in domads under esi mode which were probably methyl 3 6 deoxy α d xylo hexopyranosyl 1 3 α d galactopyranosyl 1 2 α d mannopyranoside and other carbohydrates however the main cho compounds of domwas identified under esi mode were o11 and o12 classes which contained n octyl β d maltoside an oxygenated heterocyclic compound the identified substances in esi mode were mainly o2 class and contained saturated higher fatty acids such as n hexadecanoic acid li et al 2018a more notably the cho compounds of was may be transformed from organic compounds with 2 4 nitrogen atoms to higher oxygen species after anaerobic digestion the sulfur containing compounds with the largest proportion in the two types of sludge were s1o class and most of them were related to alkylbenzene sulfonic acids wu et al 2021 the representative of dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid could be an anionic surfactant used as the raw material of various detergents e g shampoo and detergent gonsior et al 2011 found that chos compounds in municipal wastewater might be mainly attributed to anionic surfactants used as domestic detergents 3 3 2 screening of highly abundant substances between positive and negative ion recognition of sludge derived dom the molecular formulas of the top ten substances in the dom of sludge pretreated with ppl c18 ed in the dual ion modes are listed in si table s7 lignins crams and n containing free saturated compounds were the main components of domads hao et al 2020 in domwas the n containing free saturated compounds corresponding to proteins lipids and other substances in was accounted for the highest abundance additionally esi mode mainly focused on the recognition of cho and chon compounds and esi mode mostly recognized the chos compounds in sludge derived dom samples moreover the identified substances could be divided into two categories biogenic substances e g dissolved microbial metabolites and ecs checked using the chemspider database soluble microbial products are the main organic components in wastewater biological treatment among which diketopromazine dkps and hydroxyl fatty acids are representative substances which is consistent with the study of du et al 2022 substances identified as possible ecs include personal care products phthalates organic nanoparticles and surfactants which are commonly derived from household urban and industrial wastewater rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 tadeo et al 2012 as shown in fig 4 a c substances such as c19h32o3s and c18h30o3s were identified in both the domwas and domads samples which was probably related to alkylbenzene sulfonic acid groups in surfactants emulsifiers detergents and other daily necessities due to the poor biodegradability of these ecs petrie et al 2015 in the top ten substances with the highest abundance identified by ft icr ms using three pretreatment methods nearly 80 might be related to ecs additionally gc ms characterization was applied to further confirm the potential ecs types identified in sludge derived dom as shown in table s14 the phthalic acid di oct 3 yl ester dimethyl phthalate methyl stearate and other esters n hexadecanoic acid other saturated higher fatty acids and alkanols n pentadecanol could be detected in dom pretreated with ed but fewer substances than that were recognized in dom pretreated with ppl c18 moreover some might be plasticizers such as dioctyl terephthalate dop and dibutyl phthalate dbp can persist and be retained in sludge however the spe cartridges are mainly used for the enrichment of cyclododecane acetamide butyronitrile acetonitrile propionitrile and other substances 3 4 correlation statistical analysis of averaged mass spectral parameters in the ensuing discussion multivariate statistics were applied to examine and compare the compositional nature of the dom isolated by different pretreatment methods to evaluate the relevance and assist in data interpretation table s15 shows the calculated parameters for each sample and these values are used for principal component analysis pca and hierarchal cluster analysis hca pca was applied to determine the leading parameters in correlation with the corresponding sample groups rachel l sleighter 2010 this approach examined the overall nature of molecular formulas assigned to mass spectra of many samples and identified the similarities and differences between compound types in the dom samples as discussed in text s5 the pc1 pc2 of each subsample was 80 thus the linear relationship between variables was a reasonable assumption in pca additionally pc1 explained nearly 70 of the variance in samples related to their aromaticity fig 5 a dom samples with higher aromaticity i e higher dbewa and dbe cwa values had positive pc1 scores and the samples with higher aliphatic content i e higher h cwa values had negative pc1 scores as shown in fig 5 a there were no obvious differences in the properties of domwas pretreated with ed ppl and c18 in which most of them were located at pc1 0 however in domads the molecular properties of recognized molecules pretreated with ed and ppl were similar pc1 0 and that pretreated with c18 was different pc1 0 the samples of domads pretreated with both ppl and ed had positive pc1 scores due to the effective enrichment of the lignins of sludge derived dom the pc1 score of dom samples pretreated with c18 was negative indicating that they had a high aliphatic content fig 5 b shows the resulting dendrogram based on the parameters in table s15 samples cluster together based on their correlation value r the dendrogram explained that for all sludge derived dom samples the molecular properties clusters pretreated with ed and ppl methods in the same ion mode were significantly similar r 0 99 the clustering between different ion modes was 0 70 0 93 thus there were certain differences in the identification of substances confirming the superiority of dual esi modes for dom characterization over single esi mode 3 5 environmental application in this study a more effective method of ed for the sludge derived dom extraction was established compared with traditional solid phase extraction columns ppl and c18 ed had the advantages of high organic matter recovery low costly and large processing capacity making it the most innovative and practical pretreatment method for bulk sludge derived dom in ft icr ms analysis of sludge derived dom a reasonable analysis mode esi and esi modes was selected based on a clear research purpose to improve the accuracy of the description for the molecular characteristics and chemodiversity of sludge derived dom this result strongly supports subsequent studies of the molecular composition of dom derived from sludge in addition to this we also established an internal standard calibration method for exclusive sludge derived dom because it cannot be accurately calibrated using natural water internal standards in this study according to the comparison and analysis of the substances identified by the three pretreatment methods ed pretreatment not only had the highest degree of organic matter retention and more representative in sludge derived dom but also performed a satisfactory identification effect on substances that may be ecs consequently the dom extraction and analysis methods proposed in this work effectively identify the substances that may be ecs in sludge and provide a valuable reference for the subsequent utilization of organic matter in sludge resources 4 conclusions in this work a novel and more effective pretreatment method ed than spe methods was proposed for resolving the dom of sludge by using high resolution mass spectrometry and the molecular composition of sludge derived dom was further analyzed based on proving the superiority of the combination of positive and negative ion modes the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 because of the recovery of organic matter ed 70 95 the impact on functional group structure viability timeliness ed is an efficient economical pretreatment method for sludge derived dom 2 molecular properties and compositions pretreated with ppl and ed were substantially similar protein lipids and lignins were the main substances proved by pca and hca correlation r 0 99 3 the addition of esi mode increased the number of recognized molecules by over 2 fold and provided a more comprehensive range of the elements composition the number of assignments for the unsaturated hydrocarbons and n containing saturated compounds in the esi mode was increased which was probably due to the presence of aromatic dom molecules that suppressed the ionization of these entities in esi mode thus improved characterization of dom is possible through the dual ion modes for ft icr ms analysis especially for samples rich in condensed aromatic and aromatic molecules 4 dissolved microbial metabolites e g dkps hydroxyl fatty acids and ecs e g surfactants and plasticizers could be mainly substances by using ft icr ms and gc ms ecs were identified in dom due to their high stability in sewage sludge and accounted for more than 80 of the top ten substances with high abundance this work enriches the understanding of the molecular characteristics of sludge derived dom and provides reference value for the subsequent efficient safe utilization of sludge

15058,ozonation of drinking water and wastewater is accompanied by the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps such as low molecular weight aldehydes and ketones from the reactions of ozone with dissolved organic matter dom by applying a recently developed non target workflow 178 carbonous and nitrogenous carbonyl compounds were detected during bench scale ozonation of two lake waters and three secondary wastewater effluent samples and full scale ozonation of secondary treated wastewater effluent an overlapping subset of carbonyl compounds 20 was detected in all water types moreover wastewater effluents showed a significantly higher fraction of n containing carbonyl compounds 30 compared to lake water 17 all carbonyl compounds can be classified in 5 main formation trends as a function of increasing specific ozone doses formation trends upon ozonation and comparison of results in presence and absence of the oh radical scavenger dmso in combination with kinetic and mechanistic information allowed to elucidate potential carbonyl structures a link between the detected carbonyl compounds and their precursors was established by ozonating six model compounds phenol 4 ethylphenol 4 methoxyphenol sorbic acid 3 buten 2 ol and acetylacetone about one third of the detected carbonous carbonyl compounds detected in real waters was also detected by ozonating model compounds evaluation of the non target analysis data revealed the identity of 15 carbonyl compounds including hydroxylated aldehydes and ketones e g hydroxyacetone confidence level cl 1 unsaturated dicarbonyls e g acrolein cl 1 2 butene 1 4 dial cl 1 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid cl 2 and also a nitrogen containing carbonyl compound 2 oxo propanamide cl 1 overall this study shows the formation of versatile carbonous and nitrogenous carbonyl compounds upon ozonation involving ozone and oh reactions carbonyl compounds with unknown toxicity might be formed and it could be demonstrated that

spectrometry ozonation carbonyl compounds dissolved organic matter lake water wastewater phenols data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chemical disinfection and oxidation of water and wastewater is typically accompanied by reactions with water matrix components such as dissolved organic matter dom which leads to undesired disinfection or oxidation byproducts dbps or obps bond et al 2011 li and mitch 2018 richardson 2011 von gunten 2018 to date over 700 dbps have been identified from various chemical oxidants richardson and kimura 2019 water stress increases the use of impaired water resources which aggravates the problem of undesired reactions of the applied oxidants with water matrix components because of higher dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and a more heterogenous dom composition chemical oxidants can lead to a formation of carbonyl containing dbps with ozone having the most extensive formation of this compound class ramseier et al 2011 richardson 2011 richardson et al 1999 von gunten 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 carbonyl compounds have gained increasing attention due to their potential toxicity lopachin and gavin 2014 prasse et al 2018 tentscher et al 2018 during ozonation oxidation of dom occurs by ozone and or hydroxyl radicals oh which are formed from ozone decomposition buffle and von gunten 2006 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone is a relatively selective oxidant reacting mainly with electron rich moieties such as olefins activated aromatic systems and neutral amines whereas oh are less selective with most reactions close to diffusion control buffle and von gunten 2006 lim et al 2022 staehelin and hoigne 1985 von gunten 2003 one prominent ozone reaction type is the criegee mechanism which leads to a scission of a c c double bond with the ensuing carbonyl formation lim et al 2022 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 reactions with oh typically lead to c centred radicals which in the presence of dissolved oxygen further react to peroxyl radicals and finally decay to alcohols ketones and aldehydes kamath et al 2018 von sonntag et al 1997 thus both reaction pathways may lead to carbonyl compounds such as carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones which typically are easily biodegradable and thus contribute to the biodegradable and or assimilable organic carbon bdoc aoc however also potentially toxic p benzoquinones catechols or α β unsaturated carbonyl compounds may be formed glaze 1986 hammes et al 2006 marron et al 2020 nawrocki et al 2003 prasse et al 2018 richardson et al 1999 tentscher et al 2018 the aforementioned compounds might be formed from phenolic compounds which are predominant precursors in dom houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a 2020b walpen et al 2020 carbonyl compounds are also potential precursors of halogenated disinfection byproducts which are formed during reactions with free or combined chlorine i e chloramines and may even lead to an increase in toxicity or number of dbps in distribution systems marron et al 2021 phungsai et al 2019 in many cases ozonation but also chlorination is followed by a biological post treatment which in general leads to a reduction of aoc toxicity and the number of dbps observed in the finished water gulde et al 2021 hammes et al 2006 krasner 2009 philip singer 1994 shi et al 2021 van der kooij et al 1989 völker et al 2019 high resolution mass spectrometry can be applied to investigate the formation of ozonation induced byproducts with molecular weights 100 150 jennings et al 2022 phungsai et al 2016 remucal et al 2020 these and reemtsma 2005 zhang et al 2021 complementary chemical derivatisation procedures have been applied to enable the analysis of compounds with challenging physicochemical properties such as carbonyl compounds e g hydrophilic low molecular weight or poorly ionisable siegel et al 2014 vogel et al 2000 recently cross linking reactions with common nucleophiles enabled the identification of certain electrophilic α β unsaturated carbonyl compounds prasse et al 2018 with these approaches so far about 50 carbonous di aldehydes di ketones and ketoacids have been proposed to be formed during ozonation with only a part of them unequivocally confirmed or quantified hammes et al 2006 liu et al 2015 marron et al 2020 richardson et al 1999 świetlik et al 2004 tentscher et al 2018 weinberg 1999 wert et al 2007 besides carbonous also nitrogenous byproducts may be formed the most prominent example is the carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which is e g formed from ozonation of precursors such as n n dimethylsulfamide dms or dimethylamine dma andrzejewski et al 2008 schmidt and brauch 2008 von gunten et al 2010 zhao et al 2008 further nitromethane is a ubiquitous wastewater ozonation byproduct shi et al 2021 water matrix components such as dissolved organic nitrogen don or nitrite are potential precursors of n dbps thibaud et al 1987 westerhoff and mash 2002 don components such as amides pyrroles purines and pyrimidines do not release high yields of nitrate upon ozonation suggesting that their n atom might appear in ozonation induced byproducts essaïed et al 2022 despite the identification of many different n dbps the formation of nitrogenous carbonyl compounds has not been shown yet to date no systematic investigation has been performed to identify unknown carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation of real water samples only the study by liu et al 2020 elucidated carbonyl compounds derived from oxidised srfa their strategy involved stable isotope labelling after sample preconcentration and demonstrated the formation of unknown carbonous carbonyl compounds in oxidised dom isolates with discussion of potential dom precursors liu et al 2020 the use of p toluenesulfonylhydrazine as derivatising agent without any preconcentration was applied to measure selected carbonyl compounds in biological samples siegel et al 2014 or water reuse systems marron et al 2020 in a companion study this method was enhanced and systematically validated and now allows tracking of signature fragments from chromatographic separated signals for the identification of unknown non targeted carbonyl compounds manasfi et al 2023 the aims of this study are 1 to evaluate the formation of carbonyl compounds at varying specific ozone doses in lake waters and wastewaters 2 to explore a link between carbonyl compounds and their precursors and 3 to identify carbonyl compounds by non target screening combined

process and instrument controls respectively derivatisation proceeded by the addition of 200 µm p toluenesulfonylhydrazine tsh except model compounds which were derivatised with 50 µm tsh and 0 02 m hcl as specified in manasfi et al 2023 2 3 2 lc esi hrms samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography ultimate 3000 uhplc system dionex coupled to a high resolution hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer with positive electrospray ionisation esi q exactive plus thermo scientific resolution 140 000 at 200 m z as specified in manasfi et al 2023 and briefly described in section s3 si1 2 3 3 quantification of target carbonyl compounds the concentrations of acetaldehyde formaldehyde 2 3 butanedione and glyoxylic acid in the samples were quantified based on external calibrations of the target carbonyl compounds in ultra purified water for details see manasfi et al 2023 samples were blank corrected with ultra purified water only or containing phosphate buffer 5 mm

ranges of the four target carbonyl compounds are provided in fig s2 and table s5 si1 respectively 2 3 4 workflow to obtain molecular formulas from non targeted carbonyl compounds a typical workflow is presented in manasfi et al 2023 in brief compound discoverer 3 2 thermo scientific germany was used for data analysis by applying the node compound class scoring which highlights signature fragments of a derivatised carbonyl compound peak areas for pattern analysis and calibration were obtained by trace finder 5 1 thermo scientific germany molecular formulas were obtained by subtracting the molecular composition of tsh from the predicted formula obtained from compound discoverer 3 2 using a scripting node r studio an additional scripting node was implemented to obtain the c o and c h ratios of each predicted composition the tentative identification of a carbonyl compound was based on the following three criteria i presence of at least 1 out of 3 signature fragments in the ms2 spectrum ii 5 fold higher peak area compared to the blank and iii 2 fold higher peak area in an ozonated sample compared to a non ozonated sample these strict criteria enable to identify carbonyl compounds with high certainty manasfi et al 2023 all peak areas discussed in the text are reported relative to the internal standard benzaldehyde d6 tsh the analyses outputs from compound discoverer and tracefinder were exported into excel files where they were further processed in r 2 3 5 prioritisation and structural elucidation of carbonyl compounds predicted formulas were prioritised based on 1 number of water types with detection of a compound 2 number of carbons up to c5 with a few exceptions and 3 number of potential structures via scifinder service chemical abstracts 2022 selected unknown predicted formulas were structurally explained by presuming a carbonyl functional group for each derivatised site and based on the following information i ms2 fragments and retention time ii formation trend upon ozonation section 3 2 1 iii influence of ozonation conditions formation in the presence absence of oh section 3 2 2 iv kinetics and v control experiments with model carbonyl compounds and ozonated dom model compounds section 3 3 structure assignment is reported by previously defined confidence levels cl schymanski et al 2014 level 3 is the lowest confidence reported in this study because the compound class is clear for all detected molecular formulas based on the observed derivatisation and thus tentative structures could be provided for all detected molecular formulas 25 commercially available standards were purchased c2 c5 carbonyl compounds table s1 si1 a selection of carbonyl compounds was confirmed cl 1 by matching the retention time and ms2 spectrum to these standards see si1 for detailed information which were derivatised and analysed at concentrations between 0 01 4 µm additionally the derivatised standard samples were added to freshly ozonated wastewater to account for matrix effects no substantial differences in the intensity ionisability and retention times were observed for different matrices manasfi et al 2023 and in the presence of dmso fig s2 si1 2 3 6 kinetic information there are virtually no second order rate constants for the reactions between ozone and the reported carbonyl compounds thus second order rate constants for olefins were estimated based on the qsar presented in lee and von gunten 2012 often the second order rate constant of the corresponding acid was taken because of the similar taft constants for cho vs co2h 2 15 and 2 08 respectively 2 4 supporting information si three files containing si were generated si1 contains background information to analytical modelling and mechanistic data si2 summarises 36 non target carbonyl compounds with a measurement information and ms2 spectra b formation trends upon ozonation c comparison of formation for different water types d formation trends from precursors if applicable and e ion chromatograms or further ms2 spectra if applicable the information is numbered and referenced as si2 1 36 a e respectively si3 is an excel file containing all detected non target carbonyl compounds from the different water types sheet 1 and precursors sheet 2 summarising the information discussed below 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection of carbonyl compounds in ozonated lake waters and wastewaters 3 1 1 overview and characteristics of the formed carbonyl compounds three wastewater effluent and two lake water samples were ozonated in bench scale experiments followed by derivatisation with tsh in addition full scale ozonated wwtp samples were derivatised directly after sampling predicted molecular compositions were obtained from these samples as described elsewhere manasfi et al 2023 and briefly outlined in section 2 3 4 in total 178 unique molecular formulas for carbonyl compounds were annotated with the number of carbons ranging from c1 to c18 and the highest frequency between c4 and c6 figs s5a and c si1 on average 91 of the formulas contain at least two out of three signature fragments from the derivatising agent in the ms2 spectra fig s5b si1 amongst the carbonyl compounds 14 formulas 8 are also detected before ozonation and 57 formulas 32 contain at least one nitrogen atom see si3 for all carbonyl compounds 116 of the 178 formulas 65 were detected in 2 water types si3 further details on compound confirmation including the elucidation of isomers is provided in section 3 4 and si2 the predicted formulas containing a carbonyl functional group formed upon ozonation are visualised in a van krevelen diagram in fig 1a which shows the ratios of h c versus o c for each predicted formula formulas which were detected more frequently are designated with larger circle sizes the blue lines square for aromatic compounds indicate the presence of carbonyl compounds belonging to groups 1 5 lower panel fig 1 detection of carbonyl compounds in these 5 groups include saturated hydroxylated unsaturated di carbonyls keto and diketoacids and aromatic carbonyl compounds indicated by black font the observation is coherent with previous studies that reported a wide range of carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation hammes et al 2006 liu et al 2020 prasse et al 2018 richardson et al 1999 świetlik et al 2004 wert et al 2007 amongst the carbonyl molecular formulas displayed in fig 1a also n containing formulas were detected which cover the whole h c to o c range fig s6b si1 compared to formulas typically detected before ozonation region of grey box fig s6a si1 remucal et al 2020 have shown a shift to highly oxidised formulas upon ozonation of dom green box in fig s6a si1 i e from o c ratios 0 5 to the range of 0 5 1 5 with constant h c ratios liu et al 2020 observed a similar shift for the formed carbonyl compounds but at generally lower o c ratios from 0 2 to 1 pink box fig s6a si1 these differences might be caused by a detection of only derivatised carbonyl compounds compared to all features in remucal et al 2020 formulas at o c 1 were only detected in the study of remucal et al 2020 therefore formulas at o c 1 must be other compound classes such as carboxylic acids which are not derivatised and hence not detectable in liu et al 2020 and in the present study fig 1a also shows many carbonyl compounds at o c 0 5 in line with liu et al 2020 but in contrast to past findings also h c ratios 1 5 are observed fig s6a si1 this observation is reasonable if carbonyl compounds detected in this region are poorly retained in typical sample preparation procedures involving solid phase extraction liu et al 2020 and poorly ionised during electrospray ionisation remucal et al 2020 thus derivatisation of carbonyl compounds without prior sample treatment leads to a detection of additional compounds and complements previous findings 3 1 2 comparison of carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation of different water types before comparing different water types the reproducibility of detection of carbonyl compounds in the same water type was evaluated the reproducibility is illustrated by an ozonated secondary wastewater effluent from werdhölzli for the same day and for different experimental conditions table s4 si1 this comparison shows an overlap of 80 of the annotated formulas amongst samples for formulas with 6 carbon atoms section s2 fig s1 si1 consequently differing experimental conditions i e buffered vs non buffered or in the presence or absence of an oh scavenger do not lead to a significant change in detection of carbonyl compounds a general comparison reveals that the number of carbonyl containing formulas detected after ozonation of wastewater is higher than in lake water fig 1b a major influence for this finding is the higher doc concentration secondary y axis in fig 1b in wastewater which may lead to higher concentrations and enhance the detectability of carbonyl compounds to a certain extent a comparison of carbonyl compounds formed in the different water types reveals the formation of an overlapping subset of carbonyl compounds 20 tables 1 and 3 and si3 tables 1 and 3 present the annotated formulas for a selection of carbonous and nitrogenous carbonyl compounds respectively the selection includes the subset of carbonyl compounds detected in all water types additionally to those detected in all wastewaters and acrolein and c4h5no2 mentioned in the text for all carbonyl compounds refer to si3 amongst the detected carbonyl compounds 17 3 and 30 1 contain at least one nitrogen atom in lake water and wastewater respectively the number of n containing carbonyl compounds in each water type is shown by the striped stacks in fig 1b thus a significantly higher fraction of n containing carbonyl compounds is detected in wastewater compared to lake water fig s7 si1 which is rationalised by higher concentrations of nitrogen containing biomolecules in wastewater compared to lake water past studies showed increased detection of chon formulas in the lipid and protein like regions in traditional van krevelen diagrams in wastewater compared to natural aquatic systems and downstream of an increasingly wastewater impacted river berg et al 2019 maizel and remucal 2017 the strict criteria factor 5 higher than blank factor 2 higher than non ozonated sample and presence of signature fragments in the ms2 spectra enabled the detection of a carbonyl compound with high certainty but some detected carbonyl compounds with lower certainty were rejected such compounds have a bracket around the tick in tables 1 and 3 3 2 formation of carbonyl compounds upon ozonation monitoring the formation trends of carbonyl compounds as a function of the specific ozone doses in the different water types in presence or absence of dmso adds kinetic and mechanistic information to each molecular formula 3 2 1 formation trends and kinetic information in the following section typical trends upon ozonation are discussed for target and non target carbonyl compounds fig 2a and c the target carbonyl compounds were selected based on a companion study where they are detected and quantified in the range of the applied ozone doses in different water types and discussed in more detail manasfi et al 2023 here four of these target carbonyl compounds serve as examples for different trends which are discussed exemplarily to assess the observed trends for non target carbonyl compounds an overview of trends for selected molecular formulas is provided in tables 1 3 and for all molecular formulas in si3 fig 2a and c show these selected target and non target carbonyl compounds with five commonly observed formation trends for a bench scale ozonated secondary effluent from wwtp werdhölzli if detected the compounds usually show similar formation trends in all water types including full scale ozonated secondary wastewater effluent figs s8 s11 si1 i primary products with constant maximum please note primary in this context is used for products with an immediately increasing trend as a function of the ozone doses but not necessarily to describe a primary product from a precursor in the water matrix formaldehyde ch2o pink diamonds fig 2a is relatively efficiently formed from multiple precursors precursors responsible for formaldehyde formation are never fully depleted and therefore a steady state concentration of formaldehyde is reached resulting from its continuous slow formation from precursors and slow abatement by ozone and oh k o 3 0 1 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 k oh 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 at higher specific ozone doses ii primary products with further abatement acetaldehyde formation is shown as a function of increasing specific ozone doses in fig 2a c2h4o black circles the concentration reaches a maximum at typically applied specific ozone doses for enhanced wastewater treatment 0 5 1 mgo3 mgc bourgin et al 2018 and decreases for higher ozone doses its reactivity with ozone k o3 1 5 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 and oh k oh 2 4 109 m 1s 1 schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 is low but an oh induced abatement seems still plausible when the precursors are fully abated at higher specific ozone doses 1 mgo3 mgc iii products with direct but less efficient formation 2 3 butanedione c5h6o2 green squares fig 2a is an example of a product that is continuously formed from precursors in dom that react with intermediate second order rate constants with ozone k o3 103 m 1s 1 lim et al 2022 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 thus the concentrations of such precursors are only partially depleted and therefore the compound continuously increases for all applied specific ozone doses iv secondary products with constant maximum a lag phase in the increase as a function of the specific ozone dose is typical for secondary ozonation products glyoxylic acid c2h2o3 blue triangles fig 2a shows this trend which is expected based on its known formation pathway as end product from multiple ozone attacks on phenolic precursors ramseier and von gunten 2009 for non target carbonyl compounds similar trends were observed fig 2c additionally another trend was commonly observed which was not clearly seen for target carbonyl compounds manasfi et al 2023 v secondary products with further abatement the additional formation trend includes secondary products which show the same lag phase as trend iv but followed by further abatement an example for this trend is c4h7no3 grey reverse triangles in fig 2c si2 35 and table 3 for non target carbonyl compounds formation trends can provide information about their precursors and their reactivities with o3 and or oh examples are discussed in sections 3 2 2 3 3 and 3 4 besides the formation trend of a carbonyl compound upon ozonation in some cases also the stability of a derivatised compound influences its observed fate which can be used as additional information about the compound the measurements of glyoxylic acid in fig s10 si1 are quite scattered measurement sequences e g sample 1 at all ozone doses followed by sample 2 at all ozone doses decrease in peak areas over the measurement time a previous study reported that derivatised ketoacids are unstable siegel et al 2014 consequently scattered trends may imply the presence of an acid moiety i e figs si2 s23b or si2 14b and if aimed to quantify such compounds should be assessed for their stabilities as evaluated and discussed in manasfi et al 2023 3 2 2 role of water type and mechanistic aspects in general the concentrations of the formed carbonyl compounds are lower in lake water compared to wastewater which is reflected in fig 2b for a specific ozone dose of 1 mgo3 mgc similar trends at 0 5 mgo3 mgc data not shown concentrations as a function of ozone doses for a selection of target carbonyl compounds in different water types are discussed in detail elsewhere manasfi et al 2023 to obtain a better understanding of the formation of unknown carbonyl compounds in different water types ozone dosage experiments were performed with srfa and different water types in the presence of dmso a oh scavenger additionally the concentrations or areas were doc concentration normalised to reduce possible trends caused by this difference from the carbonyl compounds evaluated in this study three classes can be distinguished fig 3a the carbonyl compound yields in presence compared to absence of an oh scavenger are 1 higher fig 3a green 2 lower fig 3a blue or 3 similar fig 3a pink when doc concentration normalised areas are used 1 higher areas in the presence of a scavenger are expected from precursors with high ozone reactivity and ensuing carbonyl compound formation fig 3a green or fig si2 8c the carbonyl compounds are lower in the absence of a scavenger because their precursors could also react to other products in the presence of oh 2 if lower areas are observed in presence of a scavenger fig 3a blue or figs si2 4 6 12 14 16c two possible explanations exist i the carbonyl compound shows a relatively high k o3 and because the presence of an oh scavenger leads to a higher lifetime of ozone an enhanced abatement of the carbonyl compound is expected ii the carbonyl is formed by independent reactions with different precursors directly with ozone and or oh therefore the doc concentration normalised area is higher in the absence of a scavenger when the pool of precursors is larger due to independent contributions from both o3 and oh this case is expected if the formed carbonyl compound has a low k o3 3 similar areas in the presence and absence of a scavenger can be obtained by a complex balance of formation and abatement of carbonyl compounds by o3 and oh fig 3a pink or figs si2 7 21 33 35c a comparison of the selected four target carbonyl compounds reveals that formaldehyde and glyoxylic acid are formed at much higher concentrations in presence of dmso in contrast acetaldehyde and 2 3 butanedione yield higher concentrations in absence of dmso figs s8b s11b si1 formaldehyde and glyoxylic acid are main byproducts from direct ozonation reactions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while the observations suggest that reactions with both o3 and oh may have led to the formation of acetaldehyde and 2 3 butanedione for some carbonyl compounds detected in a lake water the doc concentration normalised peak areas for a specific ozone dose of 1 mgo3 mgc are similar to wastewater indicating that such carbonyl compounds are formed independently of the water type c4h4o3 in fig 3b or e g figs si2 14 15c however most of the carbonyl compounds show a substantially higher doc concentration normalised peak area in wastewater indicating an origin from precursors which are more abundant in wastewater c3h5no2 in fig 3b and e g figs si2 2 11 33 34c similar trends are generally observed for non target carbonyl compounds and thus this information will be used in section 3 4 for the discussion of identified non target carbonyl compounds 3 2 3 fate of carbonyl compounds during biological post treatment the formation trends discussed above indicate a general increase of carbonyl compounds upon ozonation typically ozonation is followed by a biological post treatment gulde et al 2021 hammes et al 2006 krasner 2009 philip singer 1994 van der kooij et al 1989 völker et al 2019 full scale ozonation at the wwtp werdhölzli is followed by biological sand filtration and the fate of the non target carbonyl compounds was evaluated after this process it was demonstrated that the mean areas of non target carbonyl compounds are abated during biological sand filtration almost to the levels prior to ozonation manasfi et al 2023 herein the fate is shown for a selection of carbonyl compounds fig s18 si1 section 3 4 3 3 link between detected carbonyl compounds and potential precursors previous studies showed that electron rich moieties in the water matrix and especially phenols belong to the main ozone consumers and dbp precursors during ozonation houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 von gunten 2018 walpen et al 2020 to link typical precursors to the formation of carbonyl compounds six model precursors phenol 4 ethylphenol 4 methoxyphenol sorbic acid 3 buten 2 ol and acetylacetone and further suwannee river fulvic acid srfa were ozonated table 2 provides an overview of carbonyl compounds formed upon ozonation from the selected model precursors all formed carbonyl compounds are provided in si3 the size of the circles provides an estimate for the extent to which a carbonyl compound is formed from a precursor based on its measured peak area the formation trends of these carbonyl compounds are provided in figs s12 14 si1 and in si2 if related to non target carbonyl compounds information obtained in experiments with defined precursors can be used to assess the potential origin of carbonyl compounds as shown in table 2 carbonyl compounds with the formula ch2o formaldehyde c2h2o3 glyoxylic acid and c3h4o2 methyl glyoxal are formed from all precursors and thus represent unspecific compounds which are also typical end members of ozonation the formation trends of these compounds upon ozonation of real water samples reflect this observation table 1 fig 2 interestingly many common carbonyl compounds are formed from the three phenolic compounds and sorbic acid first 10 entries in table 2 the formation trend is often similar for the three phenols but different for sorbic acid fig s12 si1 the formulas c3h2o and c5h6o contain isomers which formed upon ozonation with mainly phenolic precursors their formation seems quite wastewater specific figs si2 2c and si2 21c and independent of the presence of an oh scavenger c2h4o acetaldehyde is only formed from 4 ethylphenol and 3 buten 2 ol with two distinct formation trends fig s12 si1 for 3 buten 2 ol ozonation acetaldehyde is very efficiently formed which is rationalised by a direct ozonation reaction of a resonance form of 3 buten 2 ol for 4 ethylphenol ozonation acetaldehyde is formed less efficiently suggesting multiple reaction steps leading to its formation some isomers of c4h4o2 are formed from phenolic but also olefinic precursors with different formation trends fig s13 si1 this might be useful to distinguish potential formulas for the different isomers c4h6o2 2 3 butanedione is only formed from the olefinic precursors 3 buten 2 ol and acetylacetone further oxidation products related to precursors are discussed in section 3 4 to support structural elucidation of non target carbonyl compounds role of electron donating groups results from precursor ozonation confirm that many carbonyl compounds are formed from phenol and β diketone type structures aeschbacher et al 2012 chon et al 2015 houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a b walpen et al 2020 oxidation leads to an abatement of the electron donating capacity edc which seems to be a promising link between precursors and dbps aeschbacher et al 2012 chon et al 2015 houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a b walpen et al 2020 fig s4 si1 shows a linear correlation between the logarithmic area of carbonyl compounds and the measured residual edc of wastewater samples the latter highlights that the edc is a potential surrogate parameter for the formation of carbonyl compounds upon ozonation nitrogenous carbonyl compounds no n containing precursors were ozonated and thus only a comparison between the selected water types and ozonated srfa was possible around 15 of n containing carbonyl compounds were detected upon ozonation of srfa and most of them were also detected in lake water and wastewaters si3 this fraction of nitrogenous carbonyl compounds is similar to lake waters 17 but significantly lower than for wastewaters 30 in line with the low nitrogen content of srfa ihss 2020 consequently a significant fraction of the nitrogenous formulas detected in the wastewaters might be wastewater specific 3 4 identification of selected carbonyl compounds in this study some unknown carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation were identified overall 12 compounds were present which are amongst target compounds in a companion study 8 loq 4 loq manasfi et al 2023 8 compounds were confirmed with cl 1 and 7 compounds with cl 2 according to the classification by schymanski et al 2014 moreover the structure for 6 compounds which are classified as cl 3 can be limited to 2 isomers si2 generally derivatisation by tsh did not lead to compound specific fragments apart from tsh signature fragments indicating the presence of a carbonyl functional group manasfi et al 2023 nevertheless distinctive ms2 patterns can be obtained for different carbonyl compounds the proposed carbonyl compounds were further supported by information on the formation trends during ozonation section 3 2 1 influence of ozonation conditions section 3 2 2 and available kinetic information summarised for each discussed carbonyl compound in si2 1 36 the proposed structures for carbonous and nitrogenous carbonyl compounds are described in sections 3 4 1 and 3 4 2 respectively 3 4 1 carbonous carbonyl compounds c 2 h 4 o 2 si2 1 hydroxyacetaldehyde cl 1 is the smallest hydroxylated aldehyde which was detected in the selected water types si2 1 hydroxyacetaldehyde is efficiently formed upon ozonation and levels off at specific ozone doses 1 5 mgo3 mgc hydroxyacetaldehyde was also formed during ozonation of phenols and sorbic acid table 2 and fig si2 1d a comparison of the different water types at 1 mgo3 mgc shows higher concentrations in wastewater and a more efficient formation in the presence of oh even for doc concentration normalised areas fig si2 1c its formation during ozonation has been previously reported le lacheur and glaze 1996 liu et al 2015 a possible pathway was shown with serine where ozonation in the presence of a oh scavenger and decarboxylation at the amino carbon leads to hydroxyacetaldehyde hence the higher doc concentration normalised areas in wastewaters could be explained by the higher concentrations of amino acids in these waters 1 µg l in surface water compared to 40 µg l in wastewater dotson and westerhoff 2009 yang et al 2020 a higher formation in the absence of a oh scavenger dmso indicates an important contribution of oh reactions which would point to other precursors than serine c 3 h 2 o 3 si2 5 for c3h2o3 2 oxo propanedial cl 2 no standard available is the only probable structure with two derivatisable sites this compound is very efficiently formed upon ozonation especially in plant ozonated wastewater effluents fig si2 5b this compound is also formed from phenols secondary formation trend and sorbic acid primary formation trend table 2 and fig si2 5d c 3 h 4 o si2 6 acrolein cl 1 is efficiently formed in wastewater in absence of dmso fig si2 6b c with decreasing peak areas for higher specific ozone doses 1 mgo3 mgc acrolein is not formed from any of the precursors or from srfa the significantly more efficient formation of acrolein in absence of dmso indicates that acrolein is mainly formed by reactions of precursors with oh fig si2 6c and section 3 2 2 acrolein itself has an estimated second order rate constant for the reaction with ozone of about 103 104 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2012 and a high reactivity with oh k oh 7 0 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the area also decreases in the presence of dmso data not shown which is a consequence of the direct reaction with ozone at higher specific ozone doses 1 mgo3 mgc acrolein concentrations of up to 5 µg l were reported in ozonated wastewater effluent 1 mgo3 mgc previously marron et al 2020 in the current study concentrations of about 30 µg l 0 6 µm at 1 mgo3 mgc were estimated based on the three concentrations used for identification of the compound three point calibration acrolein is an electrophilic compound which can react with nucleophiles in proteins lopachin and gavin 2014 prasse 2021 the presence of acrolein in ozonated wastewaters is problematic as it is significantly more toxic than its saturated analogue propionaldehyde skog 1950 this highlights the importance of biological post treatment which mostly reduces the toxicity of ozonated wastewater escher et al 2009 prasse et al 2015 qualitative data from the present study indicate a removal of acrolein during sand filtration fig s18 si1 c 3 h 4 o 2 si2 7 8 this molecular formula was detected with two derivatised sites at retention times 14 7 and 16 4 min respectively with distinct ms2 spectra they could be confirmed with standards with cl 1 as malondialdehyde and methyl glyoxal malondialdehyde has not been reported during ozonation previously this compound is mostly formed in wastewater and not significantly in lake and srfa containing water and not detected at all from precursor ozonation malondialdehyde is a naturally occurring product of lipid peroxidation thiele et al 1997 as ozonation can also induce lipid peroxidation or damage cell walls hammes et al 2007 malondialdehyde might be released and therefore represent an indirect ozonation product secondary formation trend fig si2 7b malondialdehyde shows a high reactivity towards dna and forms mutagenic and carcinogenic dna adducts marnett 1999 and is thus undesired in treated waters qualitative observations during biological sand filtration after full scale ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent indicate that malondialdehyde is mostly removed fig s18 si1 methyl glyoxal has been reported as ozonation byproduct previously hammes et al 2006 richardson et al 1999 świetlik et al 2004 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wert et al 2007 methyl glyoxal is formed from many precursors table 2 and fig si2 8d and very prominently from srfa in the presence of dmso fig si2 8c qualitative observations during biological sand filtration after full scale ozonation indicate that methyl glyoxal is degraded to similar concentrations as prior to ozonation fig s18 si1 c 3 h 6 o 2 si2 9 hydroxyacetone cl 1 was detected in all ozonated water types and analogous to hydroxyacetaldehyde both oh and direct ozone pathways lead to its formation fig si2 9c and section 3 2 2 it was also detected in small concentrations during acetylacetone ozonation table 2 and fig si2 9d it is a primary type product with a slight decrease of the peak for high ozone doses the reactivity of hydroxyacetone with ozone is quite low k o3 1 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2012 and thus it may further react with oh which could explain its slightly decreasing trend for higher specific ozone doses the molecular formula of hydroxyacetone has also been detected in us drinking waters but no identification was possible khan and weinberg 2007 in contrast to the different ozonated water types an isomer was detected by ozonation of the model precursors acetylacetone sorbic acid and 3 buten 2 ol table 2 and fig si2 9d based on the criegee mechanism of 3 buten 2 ol the isomer lactaldehyde is formed which was confirmed by a standard with cl 1 ms2 spectrum fig si2 9e c 4 h 4 o 2 si2 12 13 several isomers of this molecular formula were detected evaluation of their ms2 spectra and trends after ozonation indicated two main single derivatised carbonyl compounds at retention times of 13 3 discussed here si2 12 and 15 7 min in all water types si2 13 ozonation of phenol yielded a very similar chromatogram fig si2 12e and ms2 spectrum as the ozonated wastewater samples fig si2 12a previously an α β unsaturated carbonyl compound with this molecular formula has been detected from phenol oxidation by chlorine or oh prasse et al 2018 2020 and during the ozonation of furan zoumpouli et al 2021 synthesised 2 butene 1 4 dial table s1 si1 also showed an overlap with the chromatogram and ms2 spectrum figs si2 12a and e cl 1 with the presence of three peaks with two distinct ms2 spectra the wastewater samples mainly show the presence of the smallest peak at 13 3 min fig si2 12e further investigations with nmr revealed the presence of a hydrated form of the compound c4h4o2 h2o which exhibits a neutral h2o loss in the ms fig si2 12e green chromatogram thus the observation of three peaks can be explained by the presence of cis and trans 2 butene 1 4 dial and a hydrated isomer many other dicarbonyls may have similar features to further elucidate this formula the different peaks were compared based on their evolution trends during ozonation fig si2 12f shows that all involved species follow the same formation trend during ozonation of phenol in the presence of dmso in wastewater samples fig si2 12g the hydrated isomer main peak detected in wastewater pink and blue circles has a distinct trend remains stable from the other isomers decrease at higher ozone doses grey and green circles which is rationalised by a different reactivity of the two isomers finally the secondary formation trend during ozonation indicates a quite stable compound isomer at 13 3 min which is not further degraded in the range of the applied specific ozone doses figs si2 12b and g in addition the higher areas in samples without oh scavenging indicate its formation from both ozone and oh reactions fig si2 12c its potential formation during ozone reactions of phenols is discussed below in the next section c 4 h 4 o 3 si2 14 17 four main isomers with this molecular formula were detected fig 4 shows the formation of one c4h4o3 isomer blue triangles presumably 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid cl 2 si2 17 as a function of the specific ozone doses after a maximum at a specific ozone dose of 0 5 mgo3 mgc the compound is significantly abated indicating a further reactivity with ozone k o3 103 m 1s 1 similar to fumaric acid lee and von gunten 2012 the trend does not significantly differ for the different water samples but its formation is more pronounced in absence of a oh scavenger fig si2 17c this carbonyl compound and those discussed in fig 4 are all formed during phenol ozonation table 2 and fig s15 si1 furthermore the ms2 spectra recorded in ozonated water samples and phenol solutions overlapped fig si2 17a as shown in the right panel of fig 4 the formation of c4h4o3 likely results from a muconic acid type structure where three isomers si2 28 30 were detected in wastewater here shown c6h6o3 6 oxo 2 4 hexadienoic acid cl 3 si2 28 and is a likely product from phenol ozonation table 2 figs s15 and s16 si1 mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 or microbial degradation processes of aromatic compounds in secondary treated wastewater effluents boyd and bugg 2006 fuchs et al 2011 suenaga et al 2014 as a consequence this isomer of c6h6o3 was already present in the biologically treated wastewater effluent the derivatised formula of the proposed structure c6h6o3 cl 3 pink diamonds in fig 4a and in the right panel showed a clear decrease during ozonation this trend is based on a relatively high reactivity with ozone k o3 104 m 1s 1 similar to muconic acid leitzke and von sonntag 2009 the dotted pink line represents the modelled decrease of the total c6h6o3 concentration present before ozonation 90 and formed during ozonation with ensuing oxidation 10 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the decrease coincides with the formation of 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid c4h4o3 blue triangles and 2 butene 1 4 dial c4h4o2 discussed above filled and empty green squares in fig 4 an ozone attack on muconic acid leads to the formation of 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid leitzke and von sonntag 2009 a decrease in the peak area for specific ozone doses 0 5 mgo3 mgc supports this finding as the deactivated double bond reacts further to glyoxal c2h2o2 black circles in fig 4 and glyoxylic acid c2h2o3 grey circles in fig 4 such unsaturated ketoacids are likely common transient oxidation byproducts which due to their moderate ozone reactivity may occur at sufficiently high concentrations in the range of specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 mgo3 mgc to yield chlorinated dbps after post chlorination marron et al 2020 marron et al 2021 halogenated carbonyl disinfection byproducts from 4 oxobutenoic acid analogues have been reported previously liu et al 2020 the c4h4o2 isomers filled and empty green squares in fig 4 remain quite stable which may be due to low reactivity or a steady state between formation and abatement where they react further to glyoxal c2h2o2 black circles in fig 4 as described in si2 12 c4h4o2 is 2 butene 1 4 dial cl 1 the presence of such a compound is problematic because as a type 2 alkene it shows significant toxicity lopachin and gavin 2014 prasse 2021 prasse et al 2018 however qualitative data indicate a removal of 2 butene 1 4 dial during biological sand filtration after ozonation fig s18 si1 the exemplary reaction sequence presented in fig 4 is based on the assumption of c6h6o3 formation from the phenolic ozonide at positions c1 c2 similar products are potentially formed from other ozonides section s8 si1 and from muconic acid c6h6o4 not detected in this study a typical product 6 yield from phenol ozonation ramseier and von gunten 2009 more targeted research is needed to corroborate the proposed reaction mechanism especially including the role of oh c 4 h 6 o 3 si2 18 this molecular formula has been detected in a previous study and was identified as 3 oxo butanoic acid liu et al 2020 however the only commercially available isomer was 2 oxo butanoic acid the ms2 was comparable to the detected formula but the compound showed a slightly different retention time difference of 0 5 min 2 oxo butanoic acid is not matching but a butanoic acid with the oxo group at position 3 or 4 is likely cl 3 si2 18 the derivatised mass of c4h6o3 was also detected during ozonation of phenols and acetylacetone table 2 and fig si2 18d for the phenols no ms2 was collected but for the ozonation product of acetylacetone it aligns very well fig si2 18a similar to pyruvic and glyoxylic acid c4h6o3 is formed with a secondary trend also in line with phenols as model precursors figs si2 18b d at higher ozone doses the compounds remain stable due to an expected low k o3 1 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2012 c 5 h 6 o 2 si2 22 three distinct isomers were detected for this formula the structure of 4 oxo 2 pentenal is suggested as one of the isomers in analogy to 2 butene 1 4 dial cl 1 si2 22 methylphenol a potential precursor was not part of the present study and thus no comparison to product formation from model precursors is available fig si2 22b shows the formation trend and fig si2 22a a ms2 comparison to synthesised 4 oxo 2 pentenal the areas in samples in presence of an oh scavenger are smaller than in absence this is comparable to c4h4o2 indicating that reactions with oh are taking part in their formation in analogy to the formation of 2 butene 1 4 dial fig si2 22c prasse et al 2018 this compound is removed to similar levels after sand filtration compared to the samples prior to ozonation fig s18 si1 c 5 h 6 o 3 si2 23 24 two distinct isomers were detected with this molecular formula si2 23 single derivatised and si2 24 twice derivatised 4 oxo pentenoic acid was confirmed with a standard si2 23 cl 1 replicate measurements are quite scattered indicating instability of the derivatised compound which is in line with observations for other ketoacids in this study i e glyoxylic acid fig s10 si1 this compound is a primary type product during ozonation the compound shows lower areas in presence of an oh scavenger fig si2 23c indicating a higher abatement due to reactions with ozone section 3 2 2 an α β unsaturated ketoacid product is in line with past observations suggestions of substituted phenols where ring opening products were hypothesised to be further oxidised to such unsaturated ketoacids tentscher et al 2018 furthermore this compound is an analogue to c4h4o3 formed from phenol which is mechanistically outlined in fig 4 the second compound with the formula c5h6o3 is derivatised twice si2 24 cl 3 the dicarbonyl compound is formed with a secondary trend remaining stable at higher ozone doses indicating no further reaction or a steady state several candidates exist an isomer of methyl furandione a furancarboxaldehyde or a compound with three c o functional groups si2 24 which would be similar to c3h2o3 si2 5 however 3 methyl tetrahydro 2 4 furandione si1 was only single derivatised which is clear as the other oxygens are located in an ester functional group and 2 3 4 pentanetrione and furancarboxaldehyde were not commercially available these types of compounds are an example for a group of compounds including c3h2o2 si2 4 and c3h2o3 si2 5 which have not been reported as ozonation byproducts and need further investigations c 5 h 8 o 2 si2 26 this molecular formula is formed during ozonation of lake water and wastewater with a smaller slope interestingly its peak area is higher in bench scale compared to plant ozonated wastewater and in the presence of oh fig si2 26c in any water type the peak area continuously increases and slightly levels off at high ozone doses which is rationalised by the low expected reactivity with both ozone and oh 2 3 pentanedione or 2 or 4 oxopentanal are likely candidates cl 3 si2 26 for this molecular formula glutaraldehyde could be excluded manasfi et al 2023 many structural isomers exist for this c5 formula for example acetylacetone hydroxypentenals or several methyl furanones acetylacetone k o3 5 105 m 1s 1 houska et al 2021 and furanones k o3 ranging from 104 105 m 1s 1 zoumpouli et al 2021 can be excluded since they would not build up due to a high ozone reactivity the standard 2 3 pentanedione matched with the retention time however the ms2 spectra is ambiguous and therefore cl 3 was assigned fig si2 26a 2 3 pentanedione fig si2 26b and 2 3 butanedione fig s11 si1 show very similar formation trends upon ozonation a further indication that they might be related compounds c 5 h 8 o 3 si2 27 this molecular formula has been reported and was identified as 3 methyl 2 oxo butanoic acid liu et al 2020 the derivatised mass of c5h8o3 was also detected during ozonation of 4 ethylphenol table 2 fig si2 27d but at such a low intensity that no ms2 could be recorded further compounds are compiled in si2 they contain carbonyl groups for which only a limited selection of carbonyl compounds is feasible and i no commercial standards were available si2 2 4 10 21 ii a standard was purchased but did not match si2 11 20 25 iii information was gathered but no conclusive results were obtained si2 19 or iv isomers of carbonyl compounds that were discussed si2 13 15 30 3 4 2 nitrogenous carbonyl compounds in total 57 formulas containing at least one n atom were formed upon ozonation of the different water types the formulas are found across a wide range of o c and h c ratios fig s6b si1 indicating that in analogy to the carbonous carbonyl compounds many structurally different types of nitrogenous compounds may be formed table 3 shows a selection of nitrogenous carbonyl compounds detected in this study for all carbonyl compounds refer to si3 typical n dbps formed during oxidation include haloacetonitriles haloacetamides and halonitromethanes bond et al 2011 analogues which may be ozonation induced could therefore include oxoacetonitriles oxonitromethanes or oxoacetamides cyanoformaldehyde c2hno would be the simplest oxoacetonitrile which was reported at a very low yield during ozonation of drinking water richardson et al 1999 in this study also a peak at the corresponding mass was observed and the ms1 fits to the number of n however no ms2 spectrum was obtained and no standard was available potential candidates with a higher number of c such as oxopropanenitrile c3h3no or cyanoacetaldehyde c4h5no were not detected nitroformaldehyde chno3 nitroacetaldehyde c2h3no3 or e g nitropropanal c3h5no3 could be expected as oxonitromethanes but none of the formulas was detected however the c4 and c5 analogues were detected for c4h7no3 the suspect 4 nitro 2 butanone other isomers were not available was tested but did not lead to a match with the ms2 data c4h7no3 is formed as a secondary product and it decreases at higher ozone doses in the absence of an oh scavenger which suggests further reactivity with oh section 3 2 2 and fig si2 35b furthermore the compound might be related to the n containing carbonyls discussed below which could indicate a hydroxy oxo butanamide however more data is needed for a conclusive assignment for oxoacetamides three n containing carbonyl compounds follow a pattern with increasing ch2 c2h3no2 c3h5no2 and c4h7no2 all of them show a neutral loss of m z 45 45 0207 15 ppm 45 0215 and 45 0215 both 5 ppm respectively which likely corresponds to ch3no monoisotopic mass of 45 0215 in a previous study ch2no was proposed as neutral loss during negative ionisation to rationalise hydroxyphenylacetamide which suggests that such neutral losses might be common gulde et al 2021 the applied instrument had a measurement limit of 50 da thus no lower fragments can be observed no typical loss of 17 0270 29 9980 or 45 9930 was observed and therefore amines no or nitro functional groups can be excluded ma et al 2014 control experiments demonstrated that c o in an acetamide or formamide and also a nitroso group cannot be derivatised table s1 si1 and thus such structures can be excluded nevertheless c3h5no2 was identified as 2 oxo propanamide by a standard cl 1 si2 33 which was unexpected since 3 oxo butanamide acetoacetamide could not be derivatised however the latter likely exists in its enol form which disables derivatisation if this information is applied to the c2 and c4 analogues the oxo group is either located at the α or γ c of the amide leading to 2 oxo acetamide cl 2 no standard available for c2h3no2 and 2 or 4 oxo butanamide for c4h7no2 cl 3 no standard available during ozonation 2 oxo propanamide is formed with a secondary trend levelling off at higher ozone doses fig si2 33b the ozone and oh reactivity of this compound is low von sonntag and von gunten 2012 comparison of doc concentration normalised areas amongst the different water types indicates a much higher abundance in wastewater and its presence is not significantly influenced by the presence of an oh scavenger fig si2 33c the latter indicates similar extents of formation by ozone and oh pathways section 3 2 2 the c2 and c4 analogues show very similar behaviour except that c4h7no2 is more efficiently formed si2 31 and si2 34 a hypothetical formation mechanism for c2h3no2 and c3h5no2 is outlined in figs 5 and 6 respectively fig 5 shows direct ozone attacks on the nucleobases uracil and thymine 1 after the formation of an ozonide different intermediates 2 3 are formed which may release c2h3no2 and c3h5no2 respectively 4 flyunt et al 2002 the secondary trends align with this information where c2h3no2 is only formed at a higher ozone dose compared to c3h5no2 this can be explained by the lower second order rate constant of uracil r1 h k o3 102 m 1s 1 compared to thymine r1 ch3 k o3 104 m 1s 1 theruvathu et al 2001 a previous study proposed that oh reactions may lead to a cleavage of the c n bond with a release of amides gulde et al 2021 the formation of c2h3no2 r1 h and c3h5no2 r1 ch3 4 did not differ in the presence and absence of a oh scavenger si2 31 33 which indicates that these products are formed from precursors via both ozone and oh pathways section 3 2 2 however the mechanism leading to products 4 and 5 is currently unclear moreover the carbon atoms with adjacent electron withdrawing carbonyl and amide groups are electron deficient and thus susceptible to nucleophilic attack consequently a nucleophilic attack by water or oh seems possible leading to acids 6 7 and amides 8 fig 6 shows the ozonation mechanism of pyrrole r h according to tekle röttering et al 2020 three transient ozonation byproducts are discussed tp1 or tp2 c4h5no2 and tp3 c4h3no2 maleimide tp1 contains a double bond which might directly react to carbonyl containing products c2h3no2 3 and c2h2o2 glyoxal 4 tp2 and maleimide contain a double bond which may react with ozone to ring opened products 1 or 2 that may further be cleaved to c2h3no2 5 and other carbonyl containing products 6 and 7 if a similar structure containing an additional methyl group exists i e 3 methylpyrrole with r ch3 analogues with a higher number of c atoms are possible besides the molecular formula proposed as oxoacetamide 5 also molecular formulas coinciding with the transient products tp1 tp2 and 1 were detected fig 6 their formation trends upon ozonation are shown in fig s17 si1 with all this evidence taken together such structures are likely formed c5h6n2o3 and c3h2n2o3 si2 32 and si2 36 are two additional n containing carbonyl compounds which were frequently formed both show a clear primary formation pattern and a maximum at higher specific ozone doses 1 mgo3 mgc nevertheless there is not sufficient information to assign clear structures to these formulas 4 conclusions carbonyl compounds are a major class of ozonation induced oxidation or disinfection byproducts from water matrix components such as dissolved organic matter in this study the following aspects are covered 1 formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation for a wide range of different water types 2 link between carbonyl compounds and their precursors by ozonation of model compounds and 3 identification of a set of carbonyl compounds by a ms based non target screening method combined with kinetic and mechanistic information the main findings are 178 diverse carbonyl compounds were formed during ozonation of different water types 2 lake waters 3 wastewaters 1 full scale wastewater treatment plant suwannee river fulvic acid containing water the carbonyl compounds can be classified in five different formation trends as a function of specific ozone doses eight carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation could be identified with confidence level 1 and seven with confidence level 2 some carbonyl compounds such as hydroxyacetone unsaturated dialdehydes and ketoacids potentially trialdehydes ketones and the n containing 2 oxo propaneamide are reported for the first time in real ozonated water samples an overlapping subset 20 of carbonyl compounds is detected during ozonation of different water types sample treatment conditions presence of a oh scavenger ph control have a minor influence on the detectability of carbonyl compounds during ozonation for given specific ozone doses the concentration level of a carbonyl compound in a particular water depends on the doc concentration ozonated municipal wastewater effluents show a significantly higher

oxidation of water and wastewater is typically accompanied by reactions with water matrix components such as dissolved organic matter dom which leads to undesired disinfection or oxidation byproducts dbps or obps bond et al 2011 li and mitch 2018 richardson 2011 von gunten 2018 to date over 700 dbps have been identified from various chemical oxidants richardson and kimura 2019 water stress increases the use of impaired water resources which aggravates the problem of undesired reactions of the applied oxidants with water matrix components because of higher dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and a more heterogenous dom composition chemical oxidants can lead to a formation of carbonyl containing dbps with ozone having the most extensive formation of this compound class ramseier et al 2011 richardson 2011 richardson et al 1999 von gunten 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 carbonyl compounds have gained increasing attention due to their potential toxicity lopachin and gavin 2014 prasse et al 2018 tentscher et al 2018 during ozonation oxidation of dom occurs by ozone and or hydroxyl radicals oh which are formed from ozone decomposition buffle and von gunten 2006 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozone is a relatively selective oxidant reacting mainly with electron rich moieties such as olefins activated aromatic systems and neutral amines whereas oh are less selective with most reactions close to diffusion control buffle and von gunten 2006 lim et al 2022 staehelin and hoigne 1985 von gunten 2003 one prominent ozone reaction type is the criegee mechanism which leads to a scission of a c c double bond with the ensuing carbonyl formation lim et al 2022 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 reactions with oh typically lead to c centred radicals which in the presence of dissolved oxygen further react to peroxyl radicals and finally decay to alcohols ketones and aldehydes kamath et al 2018 von sonntag et al 1997 thus both reaction pathways may lead to carbonyl compounds such as carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones which typically are easily biodegradable and thus contribute to the biodegradable and or assimilable organic carbon bdoc aoc however also potentially toxic p benzoquinones catechols or α β unsaturated carbonyl compounds may be formed glaze 1986 hammes et al 2006 marron et al 2020 nawrocki et al 2003 prasse et al 2018 richardson et al 1999 tentscher et al 2018 the aforementioned compounds might be formed from phenolic compounds which are predominant precursors in dom houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a 2020b walpen et al 2020 carbonyl compounds are also potential precursors of halogenated disinfection byproducts which are formed during reactions with free or combined chlorine i e chloramines and may even lead to an increase in toxicity or number of dbps in distribution systems marron et al 2021 phungsai et al 2019 in many cases ozonation but also chlorination is followed by a biological post treatment which in general leads to a reduction of aoc toxicity and the number of dbps observed in the finished water gulde et al 2021 hammes et al 2006 krasner 2009 philip singer 1994 shi et al 2021 van der kooij et al 1989 völker et al 2019 high resolution mass spectrometry can be applied to investigate the formation of ozonation induced byproducts with molecular weights 100 150 jennings et al 2022 phungsai et al 2016 remucal et al 2020 these and reemtsma 2005 zhang et al 2021 complementary chemical derivatisation procedures have been applied to enable the analysis of compounds with challenging physicochemical properties such as carbonyl compounds e g hydrophilic low molecular weight or poorly ionisable siegel et al 2014 vogel et al 2000 recently cross linking reactions with common nucleophiles enabled the identification of certain electrophilic α β unsaturated carbonyl compounds prasse et al 2018 with these approaches so far about 50 carbonous di aldehydes di ketones and ketoacids have been proposed to be formed during ozonation with only a part of them unequivocally confirmed or quantified hammes et al 2006 liu et al 2015 marron et al 2020 richardson et al 1999 świetlik et al 2004 tentscher et al 2018 weinberg 1999 wert et al 2007 besides carbonous also nitrogenous byproducts may be formed the most prominent example is the carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which is e g formed from ozonation of precursors such as n n dimethylsulfamide dms or dimethylamine dma andrzejewski et al 2008 schmidt and brauch 2008 von gunten et al 2010 zhao et al 2008 further nitromethane is a ubiquitous wastewater ozonation byproduct shi et al 2021 water matrix components such as dissolved organic nitrogen don or nitrite are potential precursors of n dbps thibaud et al 1987 westerhoff and mash 2002 don components such as amides pyrroles purines and pyrimidines do not release high yields of nitrate upon ozonation suggesting that their n atom might appear in ozonation induced byproducts essaïed et al 2022 despite the identification of many different n dbps the formation of nitrogenous carbonyl compounds has not been shown yet to date no systematic investigation has been performed to identify unknown carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation of real water samples only the study by liu et al 2020 elucidated carbonyl compounds derived from oxidised srfa their strategy involved stable isotope labelling after sample preconcentration and demonstrated the formation of unknown carbonous carbonyl compounds in oxidised dom isolates with discussion of potential dom precursors liu et al 2020 the use of p toluenesulfonylhydrazine as derivatising agent without any preconcentration was applied to measure selected carbonyl compounds in biological samples siegel et al 2014 or water reuse systems marron et al 2020 in a companion study this method was enhanced and systematically validated and now allows tracking of signature fragments from chromatographic separated signals for the identification of unknown non targeted carbonyl compounds manasfi et al 2023 the aims of this study are 1 to evaluate the formation of carbonyl compounds at varying specific ozone doses in lake waters and wastewaters 2 to explore a link between carbonyl compounds and their precursors and 3 to identify carbonyl compounds by non target screening combined with kinetic and mechanistic information 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and solutions a list of chemicals solutions and water types which were used in this study and information on their purity and suppliers is provided in tables s1 s4 in section s1 supporting information si1 2 1 1 lake and wastewater samples grab samples were taken from the two lake waters lw lake greifensee and lac de bret switzerland and from three secondary treated wastewater effluents ww neugut dübendorf werdhölzli zürich and glarnerland bilten switzerland the grab samples were used for batch ozonation experiments

model compounds and different water types model compound solutions phenol 4 ethylphenol 4 methoxyphenol sorbic acid 3 buten 2 ol and acetylacetone section s1 si1 were ozonated in the presence of dmso as oh scavenger 2 mm with molar ozone model compound ratios in the range of 0 5 corresponds to a range of 0 6 mgo3 mgc depending on the model compound suwannee river fulvic acid isolate srfa lw and ww samples were ozonated at different specific ozone doses between 0 and 3 mgo3 mgc in laboratory controlled experiments samples either contained phosphate buffer 5 mm at ph 7 0 0 1 with and without dmso oh radical scavenger see below and were filtered again or were not treated further table s4 si1 buffer was applied to have comparable ozonation conditions amongst the different water types unbuffered samples were necessary to directly compare to full scale ozonated wastewater with ph changes 0 3 ph units upon ozonation buffered and unbuffered samples were comparable in terms of detected formulas section s2 si1 to determine the effect of oh on the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation two sets of samples were ozonated in presence 0 5 mm and absence of dmso table s4 si1 dmso was chosen as oh scavenger because it has much lower yields of formaldehyde 1 yurkova et al 1999 from the reaction with oh compared to t butanol 25 30 acero and von gunten 2000 flyunt et al 2003 piechowski et al 1992 2 3 measurement and evaluation of carbonyl compounds 2 3 1 derivatisation of samples model compound solutions were diluted 5 50 times the other samples srfa lw ww from bench

process and instrument controls respectively derivatisation proceeded by the addition of 200 µm p toluenesulfonylhydrazine tsh except model compounds which were derivatised with 50 µm tsh and 0 02 m

in section s3 si1 2 3 3 quantification of target carbonyl compounds the concentrations of acetaldehyde formaldehyde 2 3 butanedione and glyoxylic acid in the samples were quantified based on external calibrations of the target carbonyl compounds in ultra purified water for details see manasfi et al 2023 samples were blank corrected with ultra purified water only or containing phosphate buffer 5 mm

ranges of the four target carbonyl compounds are provided in fig s2 and table s5 si1 respectively 2 3 4 workflow to obtain molecular formulas from non targeted carbonyl compounds a typical workflow is presented in manasfi et al 2023 in brief compound discoverer 3 2 thermo scientific germany was used for data analysis by applying the node compound class scoring which highlights signature fragments of a derivatised carbonyl compound peak areas for pattern analysis and calibration were obtained by trace finder 5 1 thermo scientific germany molecular formulas were obtained by subtracting the molecular composition of tsh from the predicted formula obtained from compound discoverer 3 2 using a scripting node r studio an additional scripting node was implemented to obtain the c o and c h ratios of each predicted composition the tentative identification of a carbonyl compound was based on the following three criteria i presence of at least 1 out of 3 signature fragments in the ms2 spectrum ii 5 fold higher peak area compared to the blank and iii 2 fold higher peak area in an ozonated sample compared to a non ozonated sample these strict criteria enable to identify carbonyl compounds with high certainty manasfi et al 2023 all peak areas discussed in the text are reported relative to the internal standard benzaldehyde d6 tsh the analyses outputs from compound discoverer and tracefinder were exported into excel files where they were further processed in r 2 3 5 prioritisation and structural elucidation of carbonyl compounds predicted formulas were prioritised based on 1 number of water types with detection of a compound 2 number of carbons up to c5 with a few exceptions and 3 number of potential structures via scifinder service chemical abstracts 2022 selected unknown predicted formulas were structurally explained by presuming a carbonyl functional group for each derivatised site and based on the following information i ms2 fragments and retention time ii formation trend upon ozonation section 3 2 1 iii influence of ozonation conditions formation in the presence absence of oh section 3 2 2 iv kinetics and v control experiments with model carbonyl compounds and ozonated dom model compounds section 3 3 structure assignment is reported by previously defined confidence levels cl schymanski et al 2014 level 3 is the lowest confidence reported in this study because the compound class is clear for all detected molecular formulas based on the observed derivatisation and thus tentative structures could be provided for all detected molecular formulas 25 commercially available standards were purchased c2 c5 carbonyl compounds table s1 si1 a selection of carbonyl compounds was confirmed cl 1 by matching the retention time and ms2 spectrum to these standards see si1 for detailed information which were derivatised and analysed at concentrations between 0 01 4 µm additionally the derivatised standard samples were added to freshly ozonated wastewater to account for matrix effects no substantial differences in the intensity ionisability and retention times were observed for different matrices manasfi et al 2023 and in the presence of dmso fig s2 si1 2 3 6 kinetic information there are virtually no second order rate constants for the reactions between ozone and the reported carbonyl compounds thus second order rate constants for olefins were estimated based on the qsar presented in lee and von gunten 2012 often the second order rate constant of the corresponding acid was taken because of the similar taft constants for cho vs co2h 2 15 and 2 08 respectively 2 4 supporting information si three files containing si were generated si1 contains background information to analytical modelling and mechanistic data si2 summarises

if applicable and e ion chromatograms or further ms2 spectra if applicable the information is numbered and referenced as si2 1 36 a e respectively si3 is an excel file containing all detected non target carbonyl compounds from the different water types sheet 1 and precursors sheet 2 summarising the information discussed below 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection of carbonyl compounds in ozonated lake waters and wastewaters 3 1 1 overview and characteristics of the formed carbonyl compounds three wastewater effluent and two lake water samples were ozonated in bench scale experiments followed by derivatisation with tsh in addition full scale ozonated wwtp samples were derivatised directly after sampling predicted molecular compositions were obtained from these samples as described elsewhere manasfi et al 2023 and briefly outlined in section 2 3 4 in total 178 unique molecular formulas for carbonyl compounds were annotated with the number of carbons ranging from c1 to c18 and the highest frequency between c4 and c6 figs s5a and c si1 on average 91 of the formulas contain at least two out of three signature fragments from the derivatising agent in the ms2 spectra fig s5b si1 amongst the carbonyl compounds 14 formulas 8 are also detected before ozonation and 57 formulas 32 contain at least one nitrogen atom see si3 for all carbonyl compounds 116 of the 178 formulas 65 were detected in 2 water types si3 further details on compound confirmation including the elucidation of isomers is provided in section 3 4 and si2 the predicted formulas containing a carbonyl functional group formed upon ozonation are visualised in a van krevelen diagram in fig 1a which shows the ratios of h c versus o c for each predicted formula formulas which were detected more frequently are designated with larger circle sizes the blue lines square for aromatic compounds indicate the presence of carbonyl compounds belonging to groups 1 5 lower panel fig 1 detection of carbonyl compounds in these 5 groups include saturated hydroxylated unsaturated di carbonyls keto and diketoacids and aromatic carbonyl compounds indicated by black font the observation is coherent with previous studies that reported a wide range of carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation hammes et al 2006 liu et al 2020 prasse et al 2018 richardson et al 1999 świetlik et al 2004 wert et al 2007 amongst the carbonyl molecular formulas displayed in fig 1a also n containing formulas were detected which cover the whole h c to o c range fig s6b si1 compared to formulas typically detected before ozonation region of grey box fig s6a si1 remucal et al 2020 have shown a shift to highly oxidised formulas upon ozonation of dom green box in fig s6a si1 i e from o c ratios 0 5 to the range of 0 5 1 5 with constant h c ratios liu et al 2020 observed a similar shift for the formed carbonyl compounds but at generally lower o c ratios from 0 2 to 1 pink box fig s6a si1 these differences might be caused by a detection of only derivatised carbonyl compounds compared to all features in remucal et al 2020 formulas at o c 1 were only detected in the study of remucal et al 2020 therefore formulas at o c 1 must be other compound classes such as carboxylic acids which are not derivatised and hence not detectable in liu et al 2020 and in the present study fig 1a also shows many carbonyl compounds at o c 0 5 in line with liu et al 2020 but in contrast to past findings also h c ratios 1 5 are observed fig s6a si1 this observation is reasonable if carbonyl compounds detected in this region are poorly retained in typical sample preparation procedures involving solid phase extraction liu et al 2020 and poorly ionised during electrospray ionisation remucal et al 2020 thus derivatisation of carbonyl compounds without prior sample treatment leads to a detection of additional compounds and complements previous findings 3 1 2 comparison of carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation of different water types before comparing different water types the reproducibility of detection of carbonyl compounds in the same water type was evaluated the reproducibility is illustrated by an ozonated secondary wastewater effluent from werdhölzli for the same day and for different experimental conditions table s4 si1 this comparison shows an overlap of 80 of the annotated formulas amongst samples for formulas with 6 carbon atoms section s2 fig s1 si1 consequently differing experimental conditions i e buffered vs non buffered or in the presence or absence of an oh scavenger do not lead to a significant change in detection of carbonyl compounds a general comparison reveals that the number of carbonyl containing formulas detected after ozonation of wastewater is higher than in lake water fig 1b a major influence for this finding is the higher doc concentration secondary y axis in fig 1b in wastewater which may lead to higher concentrations and enhance the detectability of carbonyl compounds to a certain extent a comparison of carbonyl compounds formed in the different water types reveals the formation of an overlapping subset of carbonyl compounds 20 tables 1 and 3 and si3 tables 1 and 3 present the annotated formulas for a selection of carbonous and nitrogenous carbonyl compounds respectively the selection includes the subset of carbonyl compounds detected in all water types additionally to those detected in all wastewaters and acrolein and c4h5no2 mentioned in the text for all carbonyl compounds refer to si3 amongst the detected carbonyl compounds 17 3 and 30 1 contain at least one nitrogen atom in lake water and wastewater respectively the number of n containing carbonyl compounds in each water type is shown by the striped stacks in fig 1b thus a significantly higher fraction of n containing carbonyl compounds is detected in wastewater compared to lake water fig s7 si1 which is rationalised by higher concentrations of nitrogen containing biomolecules in wastewater compared to lake water past studies showed increased detection of chon formulas in the lipid and protein like regions in traditional van krevelen diagrams in wastewater compared to natural aquatic systems and downstream of an increasingly wastewater impacted river berg et al 2019 maizel and remucal 2017 the strict criteria factor 5 higher than blank factor 2 higher than non ozonated sample and presence of signature fragments in the ms2 spectra enabled the detection of a carbonyl compound with high certainty but some detected carbonyl compounds with lower certainty were rejected such compounds have a bracket around the tick in tables 1 and 3 3 2 formation of carbonyl compounds upon ozonation monitoring the formation trends of carbonyl compounds as a function of the specific ozone doses in the different water types in presence or absence of dmso adds kinetic and mechanistic information to each molecular formula 3 2 1 formation trends and kinetic information in the following section typical trends upon ozonation are discussed for target and non target carbonyl compounds fig 2a and c the target carbonyl compounds were selected based on a companion study where they are detected and quantified in the range of the applied ozone doses in different water types and discussed in more detail manasfi et al 2023 here four of these target carbonyl compounds serve as examples for different trends which are discussed exemplarily to assess the observed trends for non target carbonyl compounds an overview of trends for selected molecular formulas is provided in tables 1 3 and for all molecular formulas in si3 fig 2a and c show these selected target and non target carbonyl compounds with five commonly observed formation trends for a bench scale ozonated secondary effluent from wwtp werdhölzli if detected the compounds usually show similar formation trends in all water types including full scale ozonated secondary wastewater effluent figs s8 s11 si1 i primary products with constant maximum please note primary in this context is used for products with an immediately increasing trend as a function of the ozone doses but not necessarily to describe a primary product from a precursor in the water matrix formaldehyde ch2o pink diamonds fig 2a is relatively efficiently formed from multiple precursors precursors responsible for formaldehyde formation are never fully depleted and therefore a steady state concentration of formaldehyde is reached resulting from its continuous slow formation from precursors and slow abatement by ozone and oh k o 3 0 1 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 k oh 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 at higher specific ozone doses ii primary products with further abatement acetaldehyde formation is shown as a function of increasing specific ozone doses in fig 2a c2h4o black circles the concentration reaches a maximum at typically applied specific ozone doses for enhanced wastewater treatment 0 5 1 mgo3 mgc bourgin et al 2018 and decreases for higher ozone doses its reactivity with ozone k o3 1 5 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 and oh k oh 2 4 109 m 1s 1 schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 is low but an oh induced abatement seems still plausible when the precursors are fully abated at higher specific ozone doses 1 mgo3 mgc iii products with direct but less efficient formation 2 3 butanedione c5h6o2 green squares fig 2a is an example of a product that is continuously formed from precursors in dom that react with intermediate second order rate constants with ozone k o3 103 m 1s 1 lim et al 2022 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 thus the concentrations of such precursors are only partially depleted and therefore the compound continuously increases for all applied specific ozone doses iv secondary products with constant maximum a lag phase in the increase as a function of the specific ozone dose is typical for secondary ozonation products glyoxylic acid c2h2o3 blue triangles fig 2a shows this trend which is expected based on its known formation pathway as end product from multiple ozone attacks on phenolic precursors ramseier and von gunten 2009 for non target carbonyl compounds similar trends were observed fig 2c additionally another trend was commonly observed which was not clearly seen for target carbonyl compounds manasfi et al 2023 v secondary products with further abatement the additional formation trend includes secondary products which show the same lag phase as trend iv but followed by further abatement an example for this trend is c4h7no3 grey reverse triangles in fig 2c si2 35 and table 3 for non target carbonyl compounds formation trends can provide information about their precursors and their reactivities with o3 and or oh examples are discussed in sections 3 2 2 3 3 and 3 4 besides the formation trend of a carbonyl compound upon ozonation in some cases also the stability of a derivatised compound influences its observed fate which can be used as additional information about the compound the measurements of glyoxylic acid in fig s10 si1 are quite scattered measurement sequences e g sample 1 at all ozone doses followed by sample 2 at all ozone doses decrease in peak areas over the measurement time a previous study reported that derivatised ketoacids are unstable siegel et al 2014 consequently scattered trends may imply the presence of an acid moiety i e figs si2 s23b or si2 14b and if aimed to quantify such compounds should be assessed for their stabilities as evaluated and discussed in manasfi et al 2023 3 2 2 role of water type and mechanistic aspects in general the concentrations of the formed carbonyl compounds are lower in lake water compared to wastewater which is reflected in fig 2b for a specific ozone dose of 1 mgo3 mgc similar trends at 0 5 mgo3 mgc data not shown concentrations as a function of ozone doses for a selection of target carbonyl compounds in different water types are discussed in detail elsewhere manasfi et al 2023 to obtain a better understanding of the formation of unknown carbonyl compounds in different water types ozone dosage experiments were performed with srfa and different water types in the presence of dmso a oh scavenger additionally the concentrations or areas were doc concentration normalised to reduce possible trends caused by this difference from the carbonyl compounds evaluated in this study three classes can be distinguished fig 3a the carbonyl compound yields in presence compared to absence of an oh scavenger are 1 higher fig 3a green 2 lower fig 3a blue or 3 similar fig 3a pink when doc concentration normalised areas are used 1 higher areas in the presence of a scavenger are expected from precursors with high ozone reactivity and ensuing carbonyl compound formation fig 3a green or fig si2 8c the carbonyl compounds are lower in the absence of a scavenger because their precursors could also react to other products in the presence of oh 2 if lower areas are observed in presence of a scavenger fig 3a blue or figs si2 4 6 12 14 16c two possible explanations exist i the carbonyl compound shows a relatively high k o3 and because the presence of an oh scavenger leads to a higher lifetime of ozone an enhanced abatement of the carbonyl compound is expected ii the carbonyl is formed by independent reactions with different precursors directly with ozone and or oh therefore the doc concentration normalised area is higher in the absence of a scavenger when the pool of precursors is larger due to independent contributions from both o3 and oh this case is expected if the formed carbonyl compound has a low k o3 3 similar areas in the presence and absence of a scavenger can be obtained by a complex balance of formation and abatement of carbonyl compounds by o3 and oh fig 3a pink or figs si2 7 21 33 35c a comparison of the selected four target carbonyl compounds reveals that formaldehyde and glyoxylic acid are formed at much higher concentrations in presence of dmso in contrast acetaldehyde and 2 3 butanedione yield higher concentrations in absence of dmso figs s8b s11b si1 formaldehyde and glyoxylic acid are main byproducts from direct ozonation reactions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 while the observations suggest that reactions with both o3 and oh may have led to the formation of acetaldehyde and 2 3 butanedione for some carbonyl compounds detected in a lake water the doc concentration normalised peak areas for a specific ozone dose of 1 mgo3 mgc are similar to wastewater indicating that such carbonyl compounds are formed independently of the water type c4h4o3 in fig 3b or e g figs si2 14 15c however most of the carbonyl compounds show a substantially higher doc concentration normalised peak area in wastewater indicating an origin from precursors which are more abundant in wastewater c3h5no2 in fig 3b and e g figs si2 2 11 33 34c similar trends are generally observed for non target carbonyl compounds and thus this information will be used in section 3 4 for the discussion of identified non target carbonyl compounds 3 2 3 fate of carbonyl compounds during biological post treatment the formation trends discussed above indicate a general increase of carbonyl compounds upon ozonation typically ozonation is followed by a biological post treatment gulde et al 2021 hammes et al 2006 krasner 2009 philip singer 1994 van der kooij et al 1989 völker et al 2019 full scale ozonation at the wwtp werdhölzli is followed by biological sand filtration and the fate of the non target carbonyl compounds was evaluated after this process it was demonstrated that the mean areas of non target carbonyl compounds are abated during biological sand filtration almost to the levels prior to ozonation manasfi et al 2023 herein the fate is shown for a selection of carbonyl compounds fig s18 si1 section 3 4 3 3 link between detected carbonyl compounds and potential precursors previous studies showed that electron rich moieties in the water matrix and especially phenols belong to the main ozone consumers and dbp precursors during ozonation houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 von gunten 2018 walpen et al 2020 to link typical precursors to the formation of carbonyl compounds six model precursors phenol 4 ethylphenol 4 methoxyphenol sorbic acid 3 buten 2 ol and acetylacetone and further suwannee river fulvic acid srfa were ozonated table 2 provides an overview of carbonyl compounds formed upon ozonation from the selected model precursors all formed carbonyl compounds are provided in si3 the size of the circles provides an estimate for the extent to which a carbonyl compound is formed from a precursor based on its measured peak area the formation trends of these carbonyl compounds are provided in figs s12 14 si1 and in si2 if related to non target carbonyl compounds information obtained in experiments with defined precursors can be used to assess the potential origin of carbonyl compounds as shown in table 2 carbonyl compounds with the formula ch2o formaldehyde c2h2o3 glyoxylic acid and c3h4o2 methyl glyoxal are formed from all precursors and thus represent unspecific compounds which are also typical end members of ozonation the formation trends of these compounds upon ozonation of real water samples reflect this observation table 1 fig 2 interestingly many common carbonyl compounds are formed from the three phenolic compounds and sorbic acid first 10 entries in table 2 the formation trend is often similar for the three phenols but different for sorbic acid fig s12 si1 the formulas c3h2o and c5h6o contain isomers which formed upon ozonation with mainly phenolic precursors their formation seems quite wastewater specific figs si2 2c and si2 21c and independent of the presence of an oh scavenger c2h4o acetaldehyde is only formed from 4 ethylphenol and 3 buten 2 ol with two distinct formation trends fig s12 si1 for 3 buten 2 ol ozonation acetaldehyde is very efficiently formed which is rationalised by a direct ozonation reaction of a resonance form of 3 buten 2 ol for 4 ethylphenol ozonation acetaldehyde is formed less efficiently suggesting multiple reaction steps leading to its formation some isomers of c4h4o2 are formed from phenolic but also olefinic precursors with different formation trends fig s13 si1 this might be useful to distinguish potential formulas for the different isomers c4h6o2 2 3 butanedione is only formed from the olefinic precursors 3 buten 2 ol and acetylacetone further oxidation products related to precursors are discussed in section 3 4 to support structural elucidation of non target carbonyl compounds role of electron donating groups results from precursor ozonation confirm that many carbonyl compounds are formed from phenol and β diketone type structures aeschbacher et al 2012 chon et al 2015 houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a b walpen et al 2020 oxidation leads to an abatement of the electron donating capacity edc which seems to be a promising link between precursors and dbps aeschbacher et al 2012 chon et al 2015 houska et al 2021 önnby et al 2018 rougé et al 2020a b walpen et al 2020 fig s4 si1 shows a linear correlation between the logarithmic area of carbonyl compounds and the measured residual edc of wastewater samples the latter highlights that the edc is a potential surrogate parameter for the formation of carbonyl compounds upon ozonation nitrogenous carbonyl compounds no n containing precursors were ozonated and thus only a comparison between the selected water types and ozonated srfa was possible around 15 of n containing carbonyl compounds were detected upon ozonation of srfa and most of them were also detected in lake water and wastewaters si3 this fraction of nitrogenous carbonyl compounds is similar to lake waters 17 but significantly lower than for wastewaters 30 in line with the low nitrogen content of srfa ihss 2020 consequently a significant fraction of the nitrogenous formulas detected in the wastewaters might be wastewater specific 3 4 identification of selected carbonyl compounds in this study some unknown carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation were identified overall 12 compounds were present which are amongst target compounds in a companion study 8 loq 4 loq manasfi et al 2023 8 compounds were confirmed with cl 1 and 7 compounds with cl 2 according to the classification by schymanski et al 2014 moreover the structure for 6 compounds which are classified as cl 3 can be limited to 2 isomers si2 generally derivatisation by tsh did not lead to compound specific fragments apart from tsh signature fragments indicating the presence of a carbonyl functional group manasfi et al 2023 nevertheless distinctive ms2 patterns can be obtained for different carbonyl compounds the proposed carbonyl compounds were further supported by information on the formation trends during ozonation section 3 2 1 influence of ozonation conditions section 3 2 2 and available kinetic information summarised for each discussed carbonyl compound in si2 1 36 the proposed structures for carbonous and nitrogenous carbonyl compounds are described in sections 3 4 1 and 3 4 2 respectively 3 4 1 carbonous carbonyl compounds c 2 h 4 o 2 si2 1 hydroxyacetaldehyde cl 1 is the smallest hydroxylated aldehyde which was detected in the selected water types si2 1 hydroxyacetaldehyde is efficiently formed upon ozonation and levels off at specific ozone doses 1 5 mgo3 mgc hydroxyacetaldehyde was also formed during ozonation of phenols and sorbic acid table 2 and fig si2 1d a comparison of the different water types at 1 mgo3 mgc shows higher concentrations in wastewater and a more efficient formation in the presence of oh even for doc concentration normalised areas fig si2 1c its formation during ozonation has been previously reported le lacheur and glaze 1996 liu et al 2015 a possible pathway was shown with serine where ozonation in the presence of a oh scavenger and decarboxylation at the amino carbon leads to hydroxyacetaldehyde hence the higher doc concentration normalised areas in wastewaters could be explained by the higher concentrations of amino acids in these waters 1 µg l in surface water compared to 40 µg l in wastewater dotson and westerhoff 2009 yang et al 2020 a higher formation in the absence of a oh scavenger dmso indicates an important contribution of oh reactions which would point to other precursors than serine c 3 h 2 o 3 si2 5 for c3h2o3 2 oxo propanedial cl 2 no standard available is the only probable structure with two derivatisable sites this compound is very efficiently formed upon ozonation especially in plant ozonated wastewater effluents fig si2 5b this compound is also formed from phenols secondary formation trend and sorbic acid primary formation trend table 2 and fig si2 5d c 3 h 4 o si2 6 acrolein cl 1 is efficiently formed in wastewater in absence of dmso fig si2 6b c with decreasing peak areas for higher specific ozone doses 1 mgo3 mgc acrolein is not formed from any of the precursors or from srfa the significantly more efficient formation of acrolein in absence of dmso indicates that acrolein is mainly formed by reactions of precursors with oh fig si2 6c and section 3 2 2 acrolein itself has an estimated second order rate constant for the reaction with ozone of about 103 104 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2012 and a high reactivity with oh k oh 7 0 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the area also decreases in the presence of dmso data not shown which is a consequence of the direct reaction with ozone at higher specific ozone doses 1 mgo3 mgc acrolein concentrations of up to 5 µg l were reported in ozonated wastewater effluent 1 mgo3 mgc previously marron et al 2020 in the current study concentrations of about 30 µg l 0 6 µm at 1 mgo3 mgc were estimated based on the three concentrations used for identification of the compound three point calibration acrolein is an electrophilic compound which can react with nucleophiles in proteins lopachin and gavin 2014 prasse 2021 the presence of acrolein in ozonated wastewaters is problematic as it is significantly more toxic than its saturated analogue propionaldehyde skog 1950 this highlights the importance of biological post treatment which mostly reduces the toxicity of ozonated wastewater escher et al 2009 prasse et al 2015 qualitative data from the present study indicate a removal of acrolein during sand filtration fig s18 si1 c 3 h 4 o 2 si2 7 8 this molecular formula was detected with two derivatised sites at retention times 14 7 and 16 4 min respectively with distinct ms2 spectra they could be confirmed with standards with cl 1 as malondialdehyde and methyl glyoxal malondialdehyde has not been reported during ozonation previously this compound is mostly formed in wastewater and not significantly in lake and srfa containing water and not detected at all from precursor ozonation malondialdehyde is a naturally occurring product of lipid peroxidation thiele et al 1997 as ozonation can also induce lipid peroxidation or damage cell walls hammes et al 2007 malondialdehyde might be released and therefore represent an indirect ozonation product secondary formation trend fig si2 7b malondialdehyde shows a high reactivity towards dna and forms mutagenic and carcinogenic dna adducts marnett 1999 and is thus undesired in treated waters qualitative observations during biological sand filtration after full scale ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent indicate that malondialdehyde is mostly removed fig s18 si1 methyl glyoxal has been reported as ozonation byproduct previously hammes et al 2006 richardson et al 1999 świetlik et al 2004 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wert et al 2007 methyl glyoxal is formed from many precursors table 2 and fig si2 8d and very prominently from srfa in the presence of dmso fig si2 8c qualitative observations during biological sand filtration after full scale ozonation indicate that methyl glyoxal is degraded to similar concentrations as prior to ozonation fig s18 si1 c 3 h 6 o 2 si2 9 hydroxyacetone cl 1 was detected in all ozonated water types and analogous to hydroxyacetaldehyde both oh and direct ozone pathways lead to its formation fig si2 9c and section 3 2 2 it was also detected in small concentrations during acetylacetone ozonation table 2 and fig si2 9d it is a primary type product with a slight decrease of the peak for high ozone doses the reactivity of hydroxyacetone with ozone is quite low k o3 1 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2012 and thus it may further react with oh which could explain its slightly decreasing trend for higher specific ozone doses the molecular formula of hydroxyacetone has also been detected in us drinking waters but no identification was possible khan and weinberg 2007 in contrast to the different ozonated water types an isomer was detected by ozonation of the model precursors acetylacetone sorbic acid and 3 buten 2 ol table 2 and fig si2 9d based on the criegee mechanism of 3 buten 2 ol the isomer lactaldehyde is formed which was confirmed by a standard with cl 1 ms2 spectrum fig si2 9e c 4 h 4 o 2 si2 12 13 several isomers of this molecular formula were detected evaluation of their ms2 spectra and trends after ozonation indicated two main single derivatised carbonyl compounds at retention times of 13 3 discussed here si2 12 and 15 7 min in all water types si2 13 ozonation of phenol yielded a very similar chromatogram fig si2 12e and ms2 spectrum as the ozonated wastewater samples fig si2 12a previously an α β unsaturated carbonyl compound with this molecular formula has been detected from phenol oxidation by chlorine or oh prasse et al 2018 2020 and during the ozonation of furan zoumpouli et al 2021 synthesised 2 butene 1 4 dial table s1 si1 also showed an overlap with the chromatogram and ms2 spectrum figs si2 12a and e cl 1 with the presence of three peaks with two distinct ms2 spectra the wastewater samples mainly show the presence of the smallest peak at 13 3 min fig si2 12e further investigations with nmr revealed the presence of a hydrated form of the compound c4h4o2 h2o which exhibits a neutral h2o loss in the ms fig si2 12e green chromatogram thus the observation of three peaks can be explained by the presence of cis and trans 2 butene 1 4 dial and a hydrated isomer many other dicarbonyls may have similar features to further elucidate this formula the different peaks were compared based on their evolution trends during ozonation fig si2 12f shows that all involved species follow the same formation trend during ozonation of phenol in the presence of dmso in wastewater samples fig si2 12g the hydrated isomer main peak detected in wastewater pink and blue circles has a distinct trend remains stable from the other isomers decrease at higher ozone doses grey and green circles which is rationalised by a different reactivity of the two isomers finally the secondary formation trend during ozonation indicates a quite stable compound isomer at 13 3 min which is not further degraded in the range of the applied specific ozone doses figs si2 12b and g in addition the higher areas in samples without oh scavenging indicate its formation from both ozone and oh reactions fig si2 12c its potential formation during ozone reactions of phenols is discussed below in the next section c 4 h 4 o 3 si2 14 17 four main isomers with this molecular formula were detected fig 4 shows the formation of one c4h4o3 isomer blue triangles presumably 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid cl 2 si2 17 as a function of the specific ozone doses after a maximum at a specific ozone dose of 0 5 mgo3 mgc the compound is significantly abated indicating a further reactivity with ozone k o3 103 m 1s 1 similar to fumaric acid lee and von gunten 2012 the trend does not significantly differ for the different water samples but its formation is more pronounced in absence of a oh scavenger fig si2 17c this carbonyl compound and those discussed in fig 4 are all formed during phenol ozonation table 2 and fig s15 si1 furthermore the ms2 spectra recorded in ozonated water samples and phenol solutions overlapped fig si2 17a as shown in the right panel of fig 4 the formation of c4h4o3 likely results from a muconic acid type structure where three isomers si2 28 30 were detected in wastewater here shown c6h6o3 6 oxo 2 4 hexadienoic acid cl 3 si2 28 and is a likely product from phenol ozonation table 2 figs s15 and s16 si1 mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 or microbial degradation processes of aromatic compounds in secondary treated wastewater effluents boyd and bugg 2006 fuchs et al 2011 suenaga et al 2014 as a consequence this isomer of c6h6o3 was already present in the biologically treated wastewater effluent the derivatised formula of the proposed structure c6h6o3 cl 3 pink diamonds in fig 4a and in the right panel showed a clear decrease during ozonation this trend is based on a relatively high reactivity with ozone k o3 104 m 1s 1 similar to muconic acid leitzke and von sonntag 2009 the dotted pink line represents the modelled decrease of the total c6h6o3 concentration present before ozonation 90 and formed during ozonation with ensuing oxidation 10 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the decrease coincides with the formation of 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid c4h4o3 blue triangles and 2 butene 1 4 dial c4h4o2 discussed above filled and empty green squares in fig 4 an ozone attack on muconic acid leads to the formation of 4 oxobut 2 enoic acid leitzke and von sonntag 2009 a decrease in the peak area for specific ozone doses 0 5 mgo3 mgc supports this finding as the deactivated double bond reacts further to glyoxal c2h2o2 black circles in fig 4 and glyoxylic acid c2h2o3 grey circles in fig 4 such unsaturated ketoacids are likely common transient oxidation byproducts which due to their moderate ozone reactivity may occur at sufficiently high concentrations in the range of specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 mgo3 mgc to yield chlorinated dbps after post chlorination marron et al 2020 marron et al 2021 halogenated carbonyl disinfection byproducts from 4 oxobutenoic acid analogues have been reported previously liu et al 2020 the c4h4o2 isomers filled and empty green squares in fig 4 remain quite stable which may be due to low reactivity or a steady state between formation and abatement where they react further to glyoxal c2h2o2 black circles in fig 4 as described in si2 12 c4h4o2 is 2 butene 1 4 dial cl 1 the presence of such a compound is problematic because as a type 2 alkene it shows significant toxicity lopachin and gavin 2014 prasse 2021 prasse et al 2018 however qualitative data indicate a removal of 2 butene 1 4 dial during biological sand filtration after ozonation fig s18 si1 the exemplary reaction sequence presented in fig 4 is based on the assumption of c6h6o3 formation from the phenolic ozonide at positions c1 c2 similar products are potentially formed from other ozonides section s8 si1 and from muconic acid c6h6o4 not detected in this study a typical product 6 yield from phenol ozonation ramseier and von gunten 2009 more targeted research is needed to corroborate the proposed reaction mechanism especially including the role of oh c 4 h 6 o 3 si2 18 this molecular formula has been detected in a previous study and was identified as 3 oxo butanoic acid liu et al 2020 however the only commercially available isomer was 2 oxo butanoic acid the ms2 was comparable to the detected formula but the compound showed a slightly different retention time difference of 0 5 min 2 oxo butanoic acid is not matching but a butanoic acid with the oxo group at position 3 or 4 is likely cl 3 si2 18 the derivatised mass of c4h6o3 was also detected during ozonation of phenols and acetylacetone table 2 and fig si2 18d for the phenols no ms2 was collected but for the ozonation product of acetylacetone it aligns very well fig si2 18a similar to pyruvic and glyoxylic acid c4h6o3 is formed with a secondary trend also in line with phenols as model precursors figs si2 18b d at higher ozone doses the compounds remain stable due to an expected low k o3 1 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2012 c 5 h 6 o 2 si2 22 three distinct isomers were detected for this formula the structure of 4 oxo 2 pentenal is suggested as one of the isomers in analogy to 2 butene 1 4 dial cl 1 si2 22 methylphenol a potential precursor was not part of the present study and thus no comparison to product formation from model precursors is available fig si2 22b shows the formation trend and fig si2 22a a ms2 comparison to synthesised 4 oxo 2 pentenal the areas in samples in presence of an oh scavenger are smaller than in absence this is comparable to c4h4o2 indicating that reactions with oh are taking part in their formation in analogy to the formation of 2 butene 1 4 dial fig si2 22c prasse et al 2018 this compound is removed to similar levels after sand filtration compared to the samples prior to ozonation fig s18 si1 c 5 h 6 o 3 si2 23 24 two distinct isomers were detected with this molecular formula si2 23 single derivatised and si2 24 twice derivatised 4 oxo pentenoic acid was confirmed with a standard si2 23 cl 1 replicate measurements are quite scattered indicating instability of the derivatised compound which is in line with observations for other ketoacids in this study i e glyoxylic acid fig s10 si1 this compound is a primary type product during ozonation the compound shows lower areas in presence of an oh scavenger fig si2 23c indicating a higher abatement due to reactions with ozone section 3 2 2 an α β unsaturated ketoacid product is in line with past observations suggestions of substituted phenols where ring opening products were hypothesised to be further oxidised to such unsaturated ketoacids tentscher et al 2018 furthermore this compound is an analogue to c4h4o3 formed from phenol which is mechanistically outlined in fig 4 the second compound with the formula c5h6o3 is derivatised twice si2 24 cl 3 the dicarbonyl compound is formed with a secondary trend remaining stable at higher ozone doses indicating no further reaction or a steady state several candidates exist an isomer of methyl furandione a furancarboxaldehyde or a compound with three c o functional groups si2 24 which would be similar to c3h2o3 si2 5 however 3 methyl tetrahydro 2 4 furandione si1 was only single derivatised which is clear as the other oxygens are located in an ester functional group and 2 3 4 pentanetrione and furancarboxaldehyde were not commercially available these types of compounds are an example for a group of compounds including c3h2o2 si2 4 and c3h2o3 si2 5 which have not been reported as ozonation byproducts and need further investigations c 5 h 8 o 2 si2 26 this molecular formula is formed during ozonation of lake water and wastewater with a smaller slope interestingly its peak area is higher in bench scale compared to plant ozonated wastewater and in the presence of oh fig si2 26c in any water type the peak area continuously increases and slightly levels off at high ozone doses which is rationalised by the low expected reactivity with both ozone and oh 2 3 pentanedione or 2 or 4 oxopentanal are likely candidates cl 3 si2 26 for this molecular formula glutaraldehyde could be excluded manasfi et al 2023 many structural isomers exist for this c5 formula for example acetylacetone hydroxypentenals or several methyl furanones acetylacetone k o3 5 105 m 1s 1 houska et al 2021 and furanones k o3 ranging from 104 105 m 1s 1 zoumpouli et al 2021 can be excluded since they would not build up due to a high ozone reactivity the standard 2 3 pentanedione matched with the retention time however the ms2 spectra is ambiguous and therefore cl 3 was assigned fig si2 26a 2 3 pentanedione fig si2 26b and 2 3 butanedione fig s11 si1 show very similar formation trends upon ozonation a further indication that they might be related compounds c 5 h 8 o 3 si2 27 this molecular formula has been reported and was identified as 3 methyl 2 oxo butanoic acid liu et al 2020 the derivatised mass of c5h8o3 was also detected during ozonation of 4 ethylphenol table 2 fig si2 27d but at such a low intensity that no ms2 could be recorded further compounds are compiled in si2 they contain carbonyl groups for which only a limited selection of carbonyl compounds is feasible and i no commercial standards were available si2 2 4 10 21 ii a standard was purchased but did not match si2 11 20 25 iii information was gathered but no conclusive results were obtained si2 19 or iv isomers of carbonyl compounds that were discussed si2 13 15 30 3 4 2 nitrogenous carbonyl compounds in total 57 formulas containing at least one n atom were formed upon ozonation of the different water types the formulas are found across a wide range of o c and h c ratios fig s6b si1 indicating that in analogy to the carbonous carbonyl compounds many structurally different types of nitrogenous compounds may be formed table 3 shows a selection of nitrogenous carbonyl compounds detected in this study for all carbonyl compounds refer to si3 typical n dbps formed during oxidation include haloacetonitriles haloacetamides and halonitromethanes bond et al 2011 analogues which may be ozonation induced could therefore include oxoacetonitriles oxonitromethanes or oxoacetamides cyanoformaldehyde c2hno would be the simplest oxoacetonitrile which was reported at a very low yield during ozonation of drinking water richardson et al 1999 in this study also a peak at the corresponding mass was observed and the ms1 fits to the number of n however no ms2 spectrum was obtained and no standard was available potential candidates with a higher number of c such as oxopropanenitrile c3h3no or cyanoacetaldehyde c4h5no were not detected nitroformaldehyde chno3 nitroacetaldehyde c2h3no3 or e g nitropropanal c3h5no3 could be expected as oxonitromethanes but none of the formulas was detected however the c4 and c5 analogues were detected for c4h7no3 the suspect 4 nitro 2 butanone other isomers were not available was tested but did not lead to a match with the ms2 data c4h7no3 is formed as a secondary product and it decreases at higher ozone doses in the absence of an oh scavenger which suggests further reactivity with oh section 3 2 2 and fig si2 35b furthermore the compound might be related to the n containing carbonyls discussed below which could indicate a hydroxy oxo butanamide however more data is needed for a conclusive assignment for oxoacetamides three n containing carbonyl compounds follow a pattern with increasing ch2 c2h3no2 c3h5no2 and c4h7no2 all of them show a neutral loss of m z 45 45 0207 15 ppm 45 0215 and 45 0215 both 5 ppm respectively which likely corresponds to ch3no monoisotopic mass of 45 0215 in a previous study ch2no was proposed as neutral loss during negative ionisation to rationalise hydroxyphenylacetamide which suggests that such neutral losses might be common gulde et al 2021 the applied instrument had a measurement limit of 50 da thus no lower fragments can be observed no typical loss of 17 0270 29 9980 or 45 9930 was observed and therefore amines no or nitro functional groups can be excluded ma et al 2014 control experiments demonstrated that c o in an acetamide or formamide and also a nitroso group cannot be derivatised table s1 si1 and thus such structures can be excluded nevertheless c3h5no2 was identified as 2 oxo propanamide by a standard cl 1 si2 33 which was unexpected since 3 oxo butanamide acetoacetamide could not be derivatised however the latter likely exists in its enol form which disables derivatisation if this information is applied to the c2 and c4 analogues the oxo group is either located at the α or γ c of the amide leading to 2 oxo acetamide cl 2 no standard available for c2h3no2 and 2 or 4 oxo butanamide for c4h7no2 cl 3 no standard available during ozonation 2 oxo propanamide is formed with a secondary trend levelling off at higher ozone doses fig si2 33b the ozone and oh reactivity of this compound is low von sonntag and von gunten 2012 comparison of doc concentration normalised areas amongst the different water types indicates a much higher abundance in wastewater and its presence is not significantly influenced by the presence of an oh scavenger fig si2 33c the latter indicates similar extents of formation by ozone and oh pathways section 3 2 2 the c2 and c4 analogues show very similar behaviour except that c4h7no2 is more efficiently formed si2 31 and si2 34 a hypothetical formation mechanism for c2h3no2 and c3h5no2 is outlined in figs 5 and 6 respectively fig 5 shows direct ozone attacks on the nucleobases uracil and thymine 1 after the formation of an ozonide different intermediates 2 3 are formed which may release c2h3no2 and c3h5no2 respectively 4 flyunt et al 2002 the secondary trends align with this information where c2h3no2 is only formed at a higher ozone dose compared to c3h5no2 this can be explained by the lower second order rate constant of uracil r1 h k o3 102 m 1s 1 compared to thymine r1 ch3 k o3 104 m 1s 1 theruvathu et al 2001 a previous study proposed that oh reactions may lead to a cleavage of the c n bond with a release of amides gulde et al 2021 the formation of c2h3no2 r1 h and c3h5no2 r1 ch3 4 did not differ in the presence and absence of a oh scavenger si2 31 33 which indicates that these products are formed from precursors via both ozone and oh pathways section 3 2 2 however the mechanism leading to products 4 and 5 is currently unclear moreover the carbon atoms with adjacent electron withdrawing carbonyl and amide groups are electron deficient and thus susceptible to nucleophilic attack consequently a nucleophilic attack by water or oh seems possible leading to acids 6 7 and amides 8 fig 6 shows the ozonation mechanism of pyrrole r h according to tekle röttering et al 2020 three transient ozonation byproducts are discussed tp1 or tp2 c4h5no2 and tp3 c4h3no2 maleimide tp1 contains a double bond which might directly react to carbonyl containing products c2h3no2 3 and c2h2o2 glyoxal 4 tp2 and maleimide contain a double bond which may react with ozone to ring opened products 1 or 2 that may further be cleaved to c2h3no2 5 and other carbonyl containing products 6 and 7 if a similar structure containing an additional methyl group exists i e 3 methylpyrrole with r ch3 analogues with a higher number of c atoms are possible besides the molecular formula proposed as oxoacetamide 5 also molecular formulas coinciding with the transient products tp1 tp2 and 1 were detected fig 6 their formation trends upon ozonation are shown in fig s17 si1 with all this evidence taken together such structures are likely formed c5h6n2o3 and c3h2n2o3 si2 32 and si2 36 are two additional n containing carbonyl compounds which were frequently formed both show a clear primary formation pattern and a maximum at higher specific ozone doses 1 mgo3 mgc nevertheless there is not sufficient information to assign clear structures to these formulas 4 conclusions carbonyl compounds are a major class of ozonation induced oxidation or disinfection byproducts from water matrix components such as dissolved organic matter in this study the following aspects are covered 1 formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation for a wide range of different water types 2 link between carbonyl compounds and their precursors by ozonation of model compounds and 3 identification of a set of carbonyl compounds by a ms based non target screening method combined with kinetic and mechanistic information the main findings are 178 diverse carbonyl compounds were formed during ozonation of different water types 2 lake waters 3 wastewaters 1 full scale wastewater treatment plant suwannee river fulvic acid containing water the carbonyl compounds can be classified in five different formation trends as a function of specific ozone doses eight carbonyl compounds formed during ozonation could be identified with confidence level 1 and seven with confidence level 2 some carbonyl compounds such as hydroxyacetone unsaturated dialdehydes and ketoacids potentially trialdehydes ketones and the n containing 2 oxo propaneamide are reported for the first time in real ozonated water samples an overlapping subset 20 of carbonyl compounds is detected during ozonation of different water types sample treatment conditions presence of a oh scavenger ph control have a minor influence on the detectability of carbonyl compounds during ozonation for given specific ozone doses the concentration level of a carbonyl compound in a particular water depends on the doc concentration ozonated municipal wastewater effluents show a significantly higher fraction of n containing carbonyl compounds 30 compared to lake water 17 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

have focused on the impact of microbial community differences on the corrosion of metal in full immersion and tidal zones numerous microorganisms have been isolated from q235 and concrete located in the tidal range area such as pseudomonas sp shewanella sp vibrio sp etc sun et al 2018 although these studies on microbial community profiling provide new insights into mic the detailed corrosion mechanisms of specific bacterial strains in the tidal zone are yet to be determined our previous study found that the corrosion inhibition efficiency of halomonas titanicae towards eh40 steel was enhanced in the simulated tidal zone which was bound up with the increase in the number of sessile cells and their probably enhanced aerobic respiration activity li et al 2022a compared with bacteria inhibiting corrosion more attention ought to be paid to aerobes promoting corrosion because they are more dangerous in corrosion liu et al 2015 pseudomonas aeruginosa a typical marine facultative

zhou et al 2022a it has been confirmed to be corrosive on stainless steel and carbon steel and the fundamental mechanism for corrosion is eet mediated by phenazines like pyocyanin pyo and phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn ye et al 2018 phenazines transfer electrons inward or outward crossing the cell membrane by the conversion of the redox states to accelerate corrosion only one very recent work investigated the impact of p aeruginosa on corrosion of 2205 duplex stainless steel in the simulated tidal zone and it was found that alternate immersion increased the biofilm thickness and the sessile cell number leading to more serious pitting corrosion zhu et al 2022 compared with stainless steel high strength steels with low cost and excellent mechanical properties have been widely utilized in tidal power generation equipment and various large scale marine facilities shi et al 2013 wang et al 2022b the biofilm development of p aeruginosa varies with metals and the dependences of biofilm on environmental parameters are also different among metals probably leading to different mic behavior liu et al 2021 sun et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 consequently the research on mic of high strength steels induced by p aeruginosa is highly desirable in this study the corrosion impact on high strength eh40 steel caused by the bacterium p aeruginosa was investigated systematically in simulated tidal and full immersion zones weight loss electrochemical measurement and corrosion morphology were used to characterize the differences in corrosion behaviors the biofilms and corrosion products were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps respectively high performance liquid chromatography hplc adenosine triphosphate atp detection real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr and transcriptome sequencing were used to examine the response of p aeruginosa to the alternate immersion of simulated tidal zone and revealed the mic corrosion mechanism from molecular biological level 2 experimental 2 1 specimen preparation the eh40 steel was supplied by nanjing iron steel co ltd elemental compositions wt of the coupon were c 0 086 si 0 240 mn 1 49 p 0 011 nb 0 034 al 0 034 cu 0 028 cr 0 118 ni 0 013 ti 0 010 mo 0 001 and fe balance coupons with the size of 20 mm 10 mm 5 mm were applied to all tests except for electrochemical measurements coupons with the exposed surface of 10 mm 10 mm were used as the working electrodes which were created as described previously zhu et al 2021 all coupons were polished washed dried and sterilized before being introduced into different systems according to the procedure reported wu et al 2016 2 2 organization of corrosion systems p aeruginosa was provided by the marine culture collection of china mccc the 2216e seawater culture medium was selected for p aeruginosa growth and corrosion tests it contains yeast extract 1 00 g fepo4 0 01 g and peptone 5 00 g in 1 l filtered seawater 100 ml sterilized culture medium and 1 ml p aeruginosa seed culture were used for pre growth in a swing bed shz 82 a huaruikeqi with 180 rpm min at 25 c for 24 h p aeruginosa cells at the exponential growth phase were inoculated into the culture medium with a volume ratio of 1 for corrosion tests all systems were incubated at 30 c and continuously pumped into sterilized air the experimental period was 14 d according to the duration and maintenance of p aeruginosa the device used to simulate the tidal zone has been reported in our previous study li et al 2022a the solution immersion period was the same as the air exposure period and 6 h was selected to simulate the time of the tides 2 3 weight loss measurement the coupons were cleaned their initial weight was recorded and they were immersed in the test solutions for 7 and 14 d after the immersion tests the coupons were immersed in clark s solution and ultrasonically cleaned for 15 20 s to remove the corrosion products after that the coupons were cleaned with distilled water and absolute ethanol dried and then their weights were recorded to calculate the corrosion rate six samples were used for each test to ensure the reproducibility of the data 2 4 electrochemical measurements the electrochemical analysis used a standard three electrode system with the eh40 steel specimen as the working electrode an ag agcl kcl sat electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum sheet as the counter electrode all electrochemical tests were conducted with an electrochemical workstation reference 3000 gamry and coupons of alternate immersion were measured after being transferred to solutions for 2 h linear polarization resistance lpr tests were carried out with a scan rate of 0 167 mv s from 10 mv to 10 mv vs the open circuit potential ocp electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis tests were performed at a frequency from 105 hz to 10 2 hz by a sinusoidal voltage signal of 10 mv amplitude at the stable ocp and the data were analyzed using zview2 software the potentiodynamic polarization pdp curves were conducted with a scan rate of 0 167 mv s using a voltage range from 250 mv to 250 mv vs the ocp and the data were fitted using cview2 software 2 5 corrosion morphology and product characterizations the morphology of coupons with and without corrosion product removed was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi tm3030 after 7 and 14 d the coupons with biofilms and corrosion products were fixed in 2 5 v v glutaraldehyde for 1 h and then dehydrated in ethanol with a series of concentrations v v 30 50 70 90 and 100 each for 15 min the coupons were dried via supercritical co2 and sputter coated with gold to enhance the conductivity before observation x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher scientific inc escalab xi was used to analyze the constituents of corrosion products the coupons were washed using distilled water and dried with n2 before the xps analysis 2 6 biofilm observation cell counting and transcriptome characterizations after 7 and 14 d of immersion in biotic media the confocal laser scanning microscope clsm carl zeiss lsm710 was used to observe biofilm morphology and thickness on the eh40 steel coupons the coupons of alternate immersion were taken out after the last 6 h of exposure in the air before clsm observation all coupons were taken out and rinsed gently with phosphate buffered saline pbs and dyed for 15 min in a dark environment with a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit at room temperature the 3d scanning mode was used to measure the biofilm thickness the sessile cells on coupons of full and alternate immersion were collected to count the plate counting method was used for the quantity of sessile cells with luria bertani solid medium containing nacl 5 00 g yeast extract 10 00 g and tryptone 10 00 g agar powder 18 00 g per liter of natural seawater three parallel samples were used for each test to ensure the reproducibility of the results to reveal how the alternate immersion of coupons alters gene expression across their genome sessile cells in the two environments were subjected to transcriptome analysis after immersion of 14 d sessile cells on coupons of alternate immersion as the treatment group and those on coupons of full immersion as the control group were collected and both were used for extraction of total rna transcriptomic sequencing and analysis were carried out by novogene tianjin china the detailed methods including library construction clustering sequencing and data analyses were described in the supplementary information text s1 thirty coupons were used for transcriptome analysis in each group to give good reliability 2 7 quantification of atp phenazine derivatives and key genes after 3 7 and 14 d of immersion the coupons were sampled into sterilized seawater to disperse the biofilms then the sessile cells on biofilm were collected by centrifugation at 12 000 r min for 3 min and their numbers were recorded by the plate counting method the atp content assay kit solarbio bc0300 was used to measure the viability of sessile cells in two groups according to the manufacturer s instructions the absorbance at 340 nm was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer hitachi u 3900h and atp content was calculated according to the standard curve the atp levels were expressed as µmol 1010 cells three samples were used to ensure the reliability of the measurement as redox active metabolites phenazines play important roles in eet mic of p aeruginosa the production of phenazines by sessile cells was measured via hplc analysis according to the reported method fernández and pizarro 1997 sessile cells collected to sterilized distilled water were filtered with membrane filters pore size 0 22 μm and the suspension was extracted three times with an equal volume of chloroform after pooling and evaporating the solvent the solid residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and subjected to a reverse phase column c18 solvent a composed of water trifluoroacetic acid 100 0 04 v v and solvent b composed of acetonitrile water trifluoroacetic acid 90 10 0 04 v v were used as the mobile phase phenazine derivatives were separated with a linear gradient at a flow rate of 350 μl min and monitored with a uv detector at 250 nm and 280 nm twelve coupons in each system were used to ensure the reliability of the measurement the phzs phzm and phzh genes regulate the production of electron mediators pyo and pcn of p aeruginosa influencing eet mic of carbon steel after immersion of 3 7 and 14 d the phzh gene phzm gene and phzh gene were quantitated by specific primers table s1 the components of the reaction solution were as follows 10 0 μl sybr real time pcr premixture 0 4 μl of forward and reverse primers 1 μl cdna and 8 2 μl of rnase free dh2o the cycling parameters were as follows 95 c for 5 min 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 30 all reactions were done in triplicate with the 16s rrna gene as an internal reference the expression level of genes encoding phenazines was calculated and expressed as the fold change between two states sessile cells on coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium for 3 d were used as the control group using the 2 δδ ct method twelve coupons for each system were used to ensure the reliability of the measurement 3 results 3 1 weight loss analysis fig 1 a shows the weight loss and corrosion rate of the coupons fully and alternately immersed in media with or without p aeruginosa strain after 7 and 14 d indicating a corrosion rate ranking of full immersion in abiotic medium full immersion in biotic medium alternate immersion in abiotic medium alternate immersion in biotic medium compared to the coupons fully immersed in the abiotic medium the weight loss of the coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium and alternately immersed in the abiotic medium increased by 57 110 and 102 139 respectively the higher corrosion promotion efficiency of alternate immersion origins from thin electrolyte layer tel which contributes to cathodic reaction via facile oxygen transmission p aeruginosa as an electrochemically active species has been shown to accelerate the corrosion of carbon steel via the eet process huang et al 2020 the following formula is used to evaluate the corrosion efficiency of p aeruginosa under different immersion environments 7 c o r r o s i o n e f f i c i e n c y w 1 w 2 w 2 100 where w1 and w2 are the weight loss in biotic and abiotic media respectively the corrosion efficiency of p aeruginosa on coupons of full and alternate immersion in different periods is shown in table 1 the results indicated that the corrosion of p aeruginosa on coupons was accelerated in the first 7d but inhibited in the last 7d under full immersion which was closely related to the corrosion deceleration by the accumulation of corrosion products and the death of bacteria wang et al 2022b under the alternate immersion the corrosion of samples was promoted and the corrosion promotion efficiency of p aeruginosa rose from 18 to 47 with time 3 2 electrochemical analysis fig 1b displays the variation of ocp of eh40 steel coupons with time in different systems the ocp of coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium increased in the first 3 d and then dropped to 520 mv which was also lower than the case in the abiotic medium indicating that p aeruginosa caused a higher thermodynamic tendency for corrosion the ocp of coupons alternately immersed in the abiotic medium increased first and then stabilized at around 540 mv which was also lower than that for full immersion indicating a higher corrosion tendency caused by alternate immersion the ocp of coupons fully immersed in the abiotic medium was highest and that of coupons alternately immersed in the biotic medium was lowest a more negative ocp represents a higher thermodynamic tendency for the working electrode to lose electrons i e to be corroded while the actual corrosion rate often depends on the corrosion kinetics fig 1c presents the variation of polarization resistance r p of eh40 steel coupons in different systems during the 14 d incubation period usually a higher r p indicates a lower corrosion rate except for the initial value the r p values of eh40 steel in different systems increased over time which indicated a decreased corrosion rate the presence of p aeruginosa decreased r p values in both full and alternate immersion take 14 d for example r p values were reduced by 43 and 44 under full and alternate immersion respectively consequently corrosion of eh40 steel coupons was accelerated by p aeruginosa when the coupons were alternately immersed in abiotic and biotic media r p values dropped 70 90 and 72 92 respectively also demonstrating that the corrosion rate was considerably accelerated by alternate immersion fig s1 exhibits nyquist and bode plots of eh40 steel coupons in different systems at different times and the corresponding eis fitting results table s2 were obtained by the equivalent circuit model fig s2 since the r ct values of all coupons were greater than those of r f corrosion was mainly controlled by charge transfer fig 1d and e a lower r ct value means a higher corrosion rate p aeruginosa decreased r ct in both full and alternate immersion and the r ct values of coupons fully and alternately immersed in abiotic media were 3 fold and 2 fold higher than those in biotic media on day 14 demonstrating that the corrosion promotion of eh40 steel by p aeruginosa was verified again in the sterile environment the r ct values of coupons alternately immersed were 70 80 lower than those of coupons fully immersed suggesting that the corrosion of eh40 steel was accelerated by alternate immersion r ct values of coupons alternately immersed in the biotic medium were minimum indicating the highest corrosion rate the increase in r f values with time in all systems was related to the accumulation of corrosion product films and biofilms the corrosion product films play a major role in r f because of the presence of more than 90 of water in biofilms schmitt and flemming 1999 therefore there were more corrosion products on the surface of coupons of alternate immersion than those of full immersion fig 1f displays the pdp curves of eh40 steel coupons in different systems after immersion for 14 d and the electrochemical parameters derived from the polarization curves including the corrosion potential e corr and corrosion current density i corr are listed in table s3 the i corr value of coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium was 13 3 μa cm 2 which was triple more than that of coupons fully immersed in the abiotic medium 4 1 μa cm 2 suggesting the corrosion was enhanced by p aeruginosa in the abiotic medium the i corr value of coupons of alternate immersion increased by about quintupling compared with that of full immersion and reached 22 1 μa cm 2 indicating corrosion was enhanced by alternate immersion the samples alternately exposed to the biotic medium showed the most negative corrosion potential accompanied by the highest i corr values of 30 2 μa cm 2 all the electrochemical data above both thermodynamic and kinetic are in good accordance with the results of weight loss 3 3 corrosion morphology analysis fig 2 a d and a1 d1 depict images of coupons exposed to different systems for 7 and 14 d respectively fig 2a2 d2 shows the morphology of coupons with 14 d of immersion after biofilms and corrosion products were removed only a few granular corrosion products were present on the surface of coupons fully immersed in the sterile medium and they increased over time fig 2a a1 the scratches from rubbing were observed on the metal surface with the corrosion products removed fig 2a2 after 7 d of immersion there were a lot of sessile cells on the surface of coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium accompanied by a few extracellular polymeric substances eps fig 2b the sessile cells eps and more corrosion products clustered together over time resulting in a thicker film covering most of the surface of coupons fig 2b1 there were no pristine polishing lines after the removal of films and general corrosion was observed on the surface fig 2b2 the coupons alternately exposed to the abiotic medium were covered with many fluffy corrosion products with cracks from drying fig 2c c1 more serious general corrosion was observed after removing corrosion products and there was a more obvious bumpy texture caused by corrosion on the coupons fig 2c2 a lot of loose clusters consisting of the corrosion products and the sessile cells were observed on the coupons of alternate immersion in the biotic medium fig 2d d1 the surface showed more severe corrosion with some corrosion pits after the removal of corrosion products fig 2d2 the sem results were consistent with the weight loss and electrochemical results 3 4 corrosion products analysis figure s3 shows the high resolution fe 2p3 2 xps spectra of coupons in different systems after immersion of 14 d and the binding energy be values and the relative contents rcs of corresponding compounds are shown in table 2 the main components were fe metal fe3o4 fe2o3 and feooh and their binding energies were 709 5 710 6 711 7 and 713 2 ev respectively li et al 2022b the higher rc of fe metal indicated weaker corrosion which is consistent with the weight loss and electrochemical results the rcs of fe3o4 on coupons of full and alternate immersion in the sterile media were 30 and 32 while these in the presence of p aeruginosa increased to 46 and 40 respectively feooh is more likely to transform into fe3o4 under a low do level huang and zhang 2015 due to the consumption of oxygen by p aeruginosa the content of do in the inner rust layer was low which might cause the higher rc of fe3o4 and lower rc of feooh in the biotic medium 3 5 biofilm and cell counting analysis fig 3 displays images of biofilms on coupons fully and alternately immersed in the biotic medium and fig 4 a shows the number of sessile cells at different times after immersion for 3 7 and 14 d the thickness of biofilms on coupons of full immersion was 8 11 and 23 μm respectively and the corresponding number of sessile cells was 5 2 107 1 2 107 and 3 5 106 cells cm2 the biofilm thickness increased over time while the number of live sessile cells in the early stage was higher than that in the later stage similarly under alternate immersion the thickness of biofilms on coupons increased from 18 μm on day 3 to 22 and 30 μm on day 7 and 14 respectively and the corresponding cell number decreased from 2 8 107 to 1 2 106 and 3 5 105 cells cm2 the decline of the number of live cells over time was in good accordance with the growth rhythm of bacteria in addition the live sessile cells on coupons of full immersion were more numerous than those of alternate immersion which was due to the environmental stress from alternate immersion 3 6 detection of atp and phenazines atp levels of sessile cells are shown in fig 4b the atp fluctuation revealed that microbial activity varied during different immersion periods higher atp was always detected in sessile cells on coupons of alternate immersion compared to cells on coupons of full immersion which suggested that alternate immersion could improve the physiological activity of sessile cells the activity of sessile cells increased significantly under alternate immersion and decreased slightly under full immersion with the immersion time fig 4c shows the total contents of pyo and pcn in biofilms after 3 7 and 14 d of immersion it was noted that the contents of pcn and pyo in biofilms increased with time both alternate and full immersion but p aeruginosa secreted more phenazines on coupons of alternate immersion in comparison after 14 d of immersion the phenazine contents pcn pyo in biofilms on coupons of alternate immersion increased by 53 which enhanced the mic mediated by eet in addition the contents of pyo were always kept at higher levels than those of pcn indicating that pyo might play a more important role in extracellular electron transfer as a shuttle the expressions of the genes involved in phenazine biosynthesis were also significantly up regulated in sessile cells on coupons of alternate immersion and the relative abundance of these genes was increased over time by the end of 14 d immersion the relative abundance of phzs gene phzh gene and phzm gene in cells on coupons of alternate immersion increased by a factor of 8 10 and 9 respectively fig 4d these results confirmed that the corrosion efficiency of sessile cells on coupons of alternate immersion was higher than that of full immersion 3 7 transcriptomic response of p aeruginosa to alternate immersion stress genes expression of p aeruginosa on coupons of full and alternate immersion were compared to reveal the difference of cells at the transcriptional level a total of 3894 differentially expressed genes degs in p aeruginosa on coupons responded to alternate immersion and the volcano plot illustrated that 2017 and 1877 degs were up and down regulated respectively fig s4 to gain insights into the biological roles of the degs go and kegg enrichment analyses were conducted based on the criteria of padj 0 05 the go database usually divides genes into three different categories known as the biological process bp molecular function mf and cellular component cc fig 5 a shows the top 15 terms the bp category consisted of 4 functional groups related to secondary metabolism and translation the cc category contained 6 functional groups in which most genes were related to cell parts and organelle in the mf category 5 functional groups were predicted and the genes involved in the binding of the small molecule were highly represented twenty four pathways were significantly enriched in kegg with 16 pathways being up regulated fig 5b and 8 pathways being down regulated fig 5c there are large differences in the number of up or down significantly regulated genes in kegg analysis the term biosynthesis of secondary metabolites contained the largest number of genes that were up regulated in p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion which was followed by genes assigned to the categories biosynthesis of cofactors and carbon metabolism in contrast the category abc transporters contained the largest number of genes that were down regulated in p aeruginosa followed by sulfur metabolism these results indicated that the alternate immersion of coupons is caused distinct effects on the metabolism and cellular regulation of p aeruginosa on the surface it was observed that alternate immersion affected the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of p aeruginosa in biofilms phenazines a kind of secondary metabolite produced by p aeruginosa have important physiological and biochemical functions for regulating eet in mic when coupons were alternately immersed in the biotic medium 9 genes showed significant differences in transcriptional level of which 6 were up regulated and 3 were down regulated table s4 in p aeruginosa the operons including phza1 phza2 phzb1 phzb2 phzg1 and phzg2 were responsible for producing the phenazine 1 carboxylate pca mavrodi et al 2001 subsequently the transformation from pca to pcn and pyo was mediated by three necessary genes including phzh coding phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn phzm and phzs coding pyocyanin pyo and phzs coding 1 oh phenazine 1 oh phz ye et al 2018 the expression of these genes is regulated by two component regulatory systems quorum sensing systems small rnas and environmental factors such as o2 concentration ph iron and heavy metals ye et al 2018 the up regulation of phzm s h genes can promote the production of phenazines from p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion which is consistent with the results of the phenazine concentration in biofilms fig 4c the expression level of three key genes related to phenazine biosynthesis was verified by rt qpcr and exhibited the same up regulated trend with the transcriptome results fig 4d phenazines have been reported to mediate inward eet by carrying electrons to cells in their reduced form huang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022a the eh40 steel surface acting as the electron donor releases electrons to convert extracellular oxidized phenazines into their reduced forms electrons carried by reduced phenazines are transferred to the interior of cells and consumed in the intracellular redox reactions during which the phenazines turn into an oxidized state and diffuse to the extracellular environment the electron transfer is from substances with low e 0 to substances with higher e 0 the e 0 of pyo the major phenazine produced p aeruginosa is 34 mv versus the standard hydrogen electrode at ph 7 price whelan et al 2007 the potential is high enough to allow the generation of fe2 e 0 447 mv vs she and low enough to provide electrons to various high potential oxidants the reduced pyo in cells can enter the electron transport chain through organic substances with high potential such as ubiquinone e 0 45 mv vs she to participate in energy generation or participate in some reverse processes in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle to promote metabolism such as the reduction of fumarate to succinate e 0 33 mv vs she li et al 2021 the positive bioelectric potential of the redox reaction coupling pyo oxidation with intracellular substance reduction indicates that the redox reaction of inward eet is thermodynamically favorable the alternate immersion of coupons affected the tca cycle of p aeruginosa in biofilms and promoted the expression of genes coding these key enzymes table s4 in addition the genes encoding enzymes in the electron transport chain including nadh dehydrogenase cytochrome c oxidase and genes coding atp synthase were up regulated in p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion table s4 generally the activity of electron transport would contribute to the formation of the cellular proton motive force and facilitate atp generation via the membrane bound atp synthase which was also verified by atp contents fig 4b furthermore the alternate immersion of coupons induced significant up regulation of key genes associated with bacterial motility there are 10 genes coding flagellar components and 10 related to flagellar motor rotation were up regulated table s4 the flagellar can be divided into three structural components the hook the basal body and the filament the up regulation of flagellum genes enhanced the motor rotation of the flagellum to drive bacteria toward favorable and away from harmful conditions caused by alternate immersion four chemotaxis genes were up regulated including the aerotaxis receptor aer which monitors cellular oxygen and redox potential garcia et al 2016 bacterial chemotaxis and motility require high energy and this response could be correlated with higher levels of energy being available for p aeruginosa which was consistent with the increase of metabolic activities and with the up regulation in gene expression related to energy production tambalo et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 the cell motility was promoted as chemotaxis and the flagella associated genes expression was strengthened which was important for bacterial growth and stress responses collectively these events of the increase in phenazines and atp production the enhancement of gene expression of enzymes involved in the tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation all strongly supported that alternate immersion promoted the ability of bacteria to corrode metabolize and generate energy 4 discussion the results indicated that p aeruginosa promoted corrosion under the simulated full immersion zone which mainly occurred in the early stage in the later period of full immersion the surface of coupons was covered with a film composed of corrosion products and bacteria preventing the infiltration of corrosive ions and dissolved oxygen thereby inhibiting damage to the steel wang et al 2022a in addition with the increase of time the decline of the activity and number of sessile cells also slowed down the corrosion of p aeruginosa to steels in the later period of immersion generally nitrate can be utilized as the terminal electron acceptor in mic of p aeruginosa under restricted oxygen conditions jia et al 2017 and the reactions are as follows 8 2 n o 3 10 e 12 h n 2 6 h 2 o 9 n o 3 8 e 10 h n h 4 3 h 2 o the standard potential differences of reactions 8 and 9 to 1 are 1196 and 749 mv respectively and therefore it is favorable in thermodynamics that fe0 serves as the sole electron donor for the energy production of p aeruginosa with the reduction of nitrate when sessile cells are deprived of organic carbon consequently as a facultative anaerobe p aeruginosa causes the micro environment of the metal surface to be lack of oxygen and organic carbon inducing localized corrosion in the present medium the concentration of nitrate is low ca 1 μg ml 1 which limits the nitrate reduction activity of p aeruginosa sun et al 2022 fig 6 shows the schematic illustration of the mic mechanism caused by p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion the results demonstrated that the corrosion efficiency of p aeruginosa increased with the immersion time previous studies have shown that p aeruginosa promoted stainless steel corrosion by pitting corrosion acceleration which was related to more sessile cells facilitated by more adsorbed organics and a bigger do transfer rate during alternate immersion zhu et al 2022 the rt qpcr transcriptome and detection of phenazines results indicated that the key genes encoding phenazines were up regulated and more phenazines were secreted by sessile cells on the coupons of alternate immersion which promoted the inward eet ability of p aeruginosa to accelerate the corrosion it was apparent that the genes encoding enzymes involved in carbon metabolism oxidative phosphorylation and tca cycle were up regulated under alternate immersion of coupons which increased the electron transfer caused by phenazines and the flow of protons in cells boosting the synthesis of atp in addition due to the low redox potential of phenazines it is possible to directly transfer electrons to oxygen and fe3 besides delivering electrons within a cell zhou et al reported that the reduced pcn could transfer electrons to oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide during the electron transport process leading to the destruction of the passive film zhou et al 2022b when environments lack suitable electron acceptors or the bacteria at the bottom of the biofilm cannot capture enough electron acceptors due to the diffusion limitation and rapid consumption by the biofilm closer to the environment bacteria can transfer electrons to fe3 compounds in the passive films through the conversion of the redox states of pyo and accelerate the pitting corrosion huang et al 2022 in this study compared with the coupons of alternate immersion in the sterile medium more fe3o4 and less fe2o3 and feooh were found on the coupons in the biotic medium table 2 suggesting that fe3 was possibly transformed into fe2 through phenazines in conclusion p aeruginosa was attempting to counteract the alternate immersion stress by enhancing the energy conversion which improved the production of phenazines and the ability of p aeruginosa to obtain energy through eet accelerating the corrosion of eh40 steel 5 conclusions this study investigated the mic behavior of typical marine p aeruginosa and elucidated the corrosion mechanism at the molecular biological level the results indicated that p aeruginosa accelerated the corrosion of eh40 steel and its corrosion efficiency rose over time in the simulated tidal zone which differed from that in the simulated full immersion zone in the simulated tidal zone the responses of p aeruginosa to environmental stress increased its metabolism and energy generation in particular the expression up regulation of genes coding phenazines promoted the secretion of pyo and pcn by p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion which enhanced the eet mic pathway and accelerated the corrosion of eh40 steel in the simulated tidal zone these findings advance understanding of mic in the tidal zone and will assist in assessing the potential risks of microorganisms on marine equipment compared with the laboratory conditions there are few nutrients and more microorganism species in the field marine environments and therefore the mic mechanisms of mixed bacterial strains with limited nutrients will be paid attention to in the future work moreover the availability of traditional corrosion protection methods against the tidal zone corrosion will be evaluated in the presence of microbes and specific protection methods will be designed based on mechanism research data availability statement the raw processed data required to

15059,corrosion of metals in the tidal zone shortens the service life of facilities considerably and causes extensive economic losses each year however the contribution of microbiologically influenced corrosion mic to this progress is usually ignored and consequently the research on the mechanism of mic in the tidal zone is highly desirable in this study the impact of the typical marine strain pseudomonas aeruginosa on eh40 steel corrosion in the simulated tidal zone was evaluated p aeruginosa accelerated the corrosion of eh40 steel in the simulated tidal zone and its corrosion promotion efficiency rose over time the environmental stress promoted the metabolism energy production and secretion of phenazines of p aeruginosa which promoted extracellular electron transfer between bacteria and steel and accelerated mic the study proposes a possible mechanism of mic in the tidal zone at the molecular biological level which is of theoretical significance for evaluating the corrosion risks of marine equipment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbiologically influenced corrosion tidal zone pseudomonas aeruginosa phenazine transcriptome data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the ocean a huge treasure house of resources is an indispensable space environment for human survival and development hou et al 2016 the exploitation of marine resources depends on the equipment and consequently marine engineering has become one of the indispensable pillars of economic development li et al 2015 the corrosion of marine structural steel in the tidal zone shortens the service life of facilities considerably and the corrosion of metals entirely in the tidal zone is more serious than that in the full immersion zone sun et al 2018 xu et al 2022 the corrosion of metal in the tidal zone is more complicated because of the alternate immersion and marine organisms and their metabolites also cause corrosion daille et al 2020 païssé et al 2013 sun et al 2018 however studies on metals in the tidal zone mostly ignored the influence of microbiologically influenced corrosion mic mic refers to the corrosion behavior of metal materials directly or indirectly induced by physiological activities and metabolites of microorganisms jia et al 2019 wu et al 2017 mic widely occurs in marine environments and leads to the degradation of materials performances and shortened service lifespans gao et al 2022 amounts of studies have been devoted to mic and many mechanisms have been proposed such as cathodic depolarization theory sulfide theory anodic depolarization theory and biocatalytic cathodic sulfate reduction bcsr theory li et al 2018 besides microorganisms can accelerate metal corrosion via extracellular electron transfer eet which has been considered a prevalent mic mechanism jia et al 2019 generally the eet forms could be divided into direct det and mediated electron transfer met the det model has been proved on geobacter sp and shewanella sp which utilize fe0 as the sole electron donor reaction 1 standard oxidation reduction potential e 0 447 mv vs she to couple with the reduction of fumarate

model involves electron shuttles such as h2 flavins and phenazines h2 is produced under anoxic conditions on the surfaces of iron containing metals by the cathodic reduction of protons reaction 3 coupled to anodic fe0 oxidation reaction 1 and hydrogenase positive bacteria utilize h2 as an electron donor to promote net reaction 4 to accelerate corrosion tang et al 2019 it has been reported that flavins and phenazines can also serve as electron shuttles for enhanced mic huang et al 2022 li et al 2022a in this model fe0 transfers electrons to those redox active mediators and extracellular reduced mediators function as the electron donor to participate in intracellular respiration reactions 5 and 6 the re oxidized mediators diffuse into the extracellular media to accept electrons from reaction 1 again to promote corrosion however previous investigations of the mic mechanisms mentioned above were proposed based on full immersion environments and some studies found that the presence of microbial communities on metals exposed to tidal zones could also affect corrosion daille et al 2020 sun et al 2018 1 f e 0 f e 2 2 e 2 f u m a r a t e 2 h 2 e s u c c i n a t e 3 2 h 2 e h 2 4 f e

have focused on the impact of microbial community differences on the corrosion of metal in full immersion and tidal zones numerous microorganisms have been isolated from q235 and concrete located in the tidal range area such as pseudomonas sp shewanella sp vibrio sp etc sun et al 2018 although these studies on microbial community profiling provide new insights into mic the detailed corrosion mechanisms of specific bacterial strains in the tidal zone are yet to be determined our previous study found that the corrosion inhibition efficiency of halomonas titanicae towards eh40 steel was enhanced in the simulated tidal zone which was bound up with the increase in the number of sessile cells and their probably enhanced aerobic respiration activity li et al 2022a compared with bacteria inhibiting corrosion more attention ought to be paid to aerobes promoting corrosion because they are more dangerous in corrosion liu et al 2015 pseudomonas aeruginosa a typical marine facultative aerobic bacterium is preferentially attached to metals and serves as a pioneer colonizer to facilitate the subsequent attachment of anaerobes during biofilm formation chugh et al 2022 xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2022a it has been confirmed to be corrosive on stainless steel and carbon steel and the fundamental mechanism for corrosion is eet mediated by phenazines like pyocyanin pyo and phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn ye et al 2018 phenazines transfer electrons inward or outward crossing the cell membrane by the conversion of the redox states to accelerate corrosion only one very recent work investigated the impact of p aeruginosa on corrosion of 2205 duplex stainless steel in the simulated tidal zone and it was found that alternate immersion increased the biofilm thickness and the sessile cell number leading to more serious pitting corrosion zhu et al 2022 compared with stainless steel high strength steels with low cost and excellent mechanical properties have been widely utilized in tidal power generation equipment and various large scale marine facilities shi et al 2013 wang et al 2022b the biofilm development of p aeruginosa varies with metals and the dependences of biofilm on environmental parameters are also different among metals probably leading to different mic behavior liu et al 2021 sun et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 consequently the research on mic of high strength steels induced by p aeruginosa is highly desirable in this study the corrosion impact on high strength eh40 steel caused by the bacterium p aeruginosa was investigated systematically in simulated tidal and full immersion zones weight loss electrochemical measurement and corrosion morphology were used to characterize the differences in corrosion behaviors the biofilms and corrosion products were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps respectively high performance liquid chromatography hplc adenosine triphosphate atp detection real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr and transcriptome sequencing were used to examine the response of p aeruginosa to the alternate immersion of simulated tidal zone and revealed the mic corrosion mechanism from molecular biological level 2 experimental 2 1 specimen preparation the eh40 steel was supplied by nanjing iron steel co ltd elemental compositions wt of the coupon were c 0 086 si 0 240 mn 1 49 p 0 011 nb 0 034 al 0 034 cu 0 028 cr 0 118 ni 0 013 ti 0 010 mo 0 001 and fe balance coupons with the size of 20 mm 10 mm 5 mm were applied to all tests except for electrochemical measurements coupons with the exposed surface of 10 mm 10 mm were used as the working electrodes which were created as described previously zhu et al 2021 all coupons were polished washed dried and sterilized before being introduced into different systems according to the procedure reported wu et al 2016 2 2 organization of corrosion systems p aeruginosa was provided by the marine culture collection of china mccc the 2216e seawater culture medium was selected for p aeruginosa growth and corrosion tests it contains yeast extract 1 00 g fepo4 0 01 g and peptone 5 00 g in 1 l filtered seawater 100 ml sterilized culture medium and 1 ml p aeruginosa seed culture were used for pre growth in a swing bed shz 82 a huaruikeqi with 180 rpm min at 25 c for 24 h p aeruginosa cells at the exponential growth phase were inoculated into the culture medium with a volume ratio of 1 for corrosion tests all systems were incubated at 30 c and continuously pumped into sterilized air the experimental period was 14 d according to the duration and maintenance of p aeruginosa the device used to simulate the tidal zone has been reported in our previous study li et al 2022a the solution immersion period was the same as the air exposure period and 6 h was selected to simulate the time of the tides 2 3 weight loss measurement the coupons were cleaned their initial weight was recorded and they were immersed in the test solutions for 7 and 14 d after the immersion tests the coupons were immersed in clark s solution and ultrasonically cleaned for 15 20 s to remove the corrosion products after that the coupons were cleaned with distilled water and absolute ethanol dried and then their weights were recorded to calculate the corrosion rate six samples were used for each test to ensure the reproducibility of the data 2 4 electrochemical measurements the electrochemical analysis used a standard three electrode system with the eh40 steel specimen as the working electrode an ag agcl kcl sat electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum sheet as the counter electrode all electrochemical tests were conducted with an electrochemical workstation reference 3000 gamry and coupons of alternate immersion were measured after being transferred to solutions for 2 h linear polarization resistance lpr tests were carried out with a scan rate of 0 167 mv s from 10 mv to 10 mv

ocp and the data were analyzed using zview2 software the potentiodynamic polarization pdp curves were conducted with a scan rate of 0 167 mv s using a voltage range from 250 mv to 250 mv vs the ocp and the data were fitted using cview2 software 2 5 corrosion morphology and product characterizations the morphology of coupons with and without corrosion product removed was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi tm3030 after 7 and 14 d the coupons with biofilms and corrosion products were fixed in 2 5 v v glutaraldehyde for 1 h and then dehydrated in ethanol with a series of concentrations v v 30 50 70 90 and 100 each for 15 min the coupons were dried via supercritical co2 and sputter coated with gold to enhance the conductivity before observation x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher scientific inc escalab xi was used to analyze the constituents of corrosion products the coupons were washed using distilled water and dried with n2 before the xps analysis 2 6 biofilm observation cell counting and transcriptome characterizations after 7 and 14 d of immersion in biotic media the confocal laser scanning microscope clsm carl zeiss lsm710 was used to observe biofilm morphology and thickness on the eh40 steel coupons the coupons of alternate immersion were taken out after the last 6 h of exposure in the air before clsm observation all coupons were taken out and rinsed gently with phosphate buffered saline pbs and dyed for 15 min in a dark environment with a live dead baclight bacterial viability kit at room temperature the 3d scanning mode was used to measure the biofilm thickness the sessile cells on coupons of full and alternate immersion were collected to count the plate counting method was used for the quantity of sessile cells with luria bertani solid medium containing nacl 5 00 g yeast extract 10 00 g and tryptone 10 00 g agar powder 18 00 g per liter of natural seawater three parallel samples were used for each test to ensure the reproducibility of the results to reveal how the alternate immersion of coupons alters gene expression across their genome sessile cells in the two environments were subjected to transcriptome analysis after immersion of 14 d sessile cells on coupons of alternate immersion as the treatment group and those on coupons of full immersion as the control group were collected and both were used for extraction of total rna transcriptomic sequencing and analysis were carried out by novogene tianjin china the detailed methods including library construction clustering sequencing and data analyses were described in the supplementary information text s1 thirty coupons were used for transcriptome analysis in each group to give good reliability 2 7 quantification of atp phenazine derivatives and key genes after 3 7 and 14 d of immersion the coupons were sampled into sterilized seawater to disperse the biofilms then the sessile cells on biofilm were collected by centrifugation at 12 000 r min for 3 min and their numbers were recorded by the plate counting method the atp content assay kit solarbio bc0300 was used to measure the viability of sessile cells in two groups according to the manufacturer s instructions the absorbance at 340 nm was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer hitachi u 3900h and atp content was calculated according to the standard curve the atp levels were expressed as µmol 1010 cells three samples were used to ensure the reliability of the measurement as redox active metabolites phenazines play important roles in eet mic of p aeruginosa the production of phenazines by sessile cells was measured via hplc analysis according to the reported method fernández and pizarro 1997 sessile cells collected to sterilized distilled

acid 90 10 0 04 v v were used as the mobile phase phenazine derivatives were separated with a linear gradient at a flow rate of 350 μl min and monitored with a uv detector at 250 nm and 280 nm twelve coupons in each system were used to ensure the reliability of the measurement the phzs phzm and phzh genes regulate the production of electron mediators pyo and pcn of p aeruginosa influencing eet mic of carbon steel after immersion of 3 7 and 14 d the phzh gene phzm gene and phzh gene were quantitated by specific primers table s1 the components of the reaction solution were as follows 10 0 μl sybr real time pcr premixture 0 4 μl of forward and reverse primers 1 μl cdna and 8 2 μl of rnase free dh2o the cycling parameters were as follows 95 c for 5 min 40 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 30 all reactions were done in triplicate with the 16s rrna gene as an internal reference the expression level of genes encoding phenazines was calculated and expressed as the fold change between two states sessile cells on coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium for 3 d were used as the control group using the 2 δδ ct method twelve coupons for each system were used to ensure the reliability of the measurement 3 results 3 1 weight loss analysis fig 1 a shows the weight loss and corrosion rate of the coupons fully and alternately immersed in media with or without p aeruginosa strain after 7 and 14 d indicating a corrosion rate ranking of full immersion in abiotic medium full immersion in biotic medium alternate immersion in abiotic medium alternate immersion in biotic medium compared to the coupons fully immersed in the abiotic medium the weight loss of the coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium and alternately immersed in the abiotic medium increased by 57 110 and 102 139 respectively the higher corrosion promotion efficiency of alternate immersion origins from thin electrolyte layer tel which contributes to cathodic reaction via facile oxygen transmission p aeruginosa as an electrochemically active species has been shown to accelerate the corrosion of carbon steel via the eet process huang et al 2020 the following formula is used to evaluate the corrosion efficiency of p aeruginosa under different immersion environments 7 c o r r o s i o n e f f i c i e n c y w 1 w 2 w 2 100 where w1 and w2 are the weight loss in biotic and abiotic media respectively the corrosion efficiency of p aeruginosa on coupons of full and alternate immersion in different periods is shown in table 1 the results indicated that the corrosion of p aeruginosa on coupons was accelerated in the first 7d but inhibited in the last 7d under full immersion which was closely related to the corrosion deceleration by the accumulation of corrosion products and the death of bacteria wang et al 2022b under the alternate immersion the corrosion of samples was promoted and the corrosion promotion efficiency of p aeruginosa rose from 18 to 47 with time 3 2 electrochemical analysis fig 1b displays the variation of ocp of eh40 steel coupons with time in different systems the ocp of coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium increased in the first 3 d and then dropped to 520 mv which was also lower than the case in the abiotic medium indicating that p aeruginosa caused a higher thermodynamic tendency for corrosion the ocp of coupons alternately immersed in the abiotic medium increased first and then stabilized at around 540 mv which was also lower than that for full immersion indicating a higher corrosion tendency caused by alternate immersion the ocp of coupons fully immersed in the abiotic medium was highest and that of coupons alternately immersed in the biotic medium was lowest a more negative ocp represents a higher thermodynamic tendency for the working electrode to lose electrons i e to be corroded while the actual corrosion rate often depends on the corrosion kinetics fig 1c presents the variation of polarization resistance r p of eh40 steel coupons in different systems during the 14 d incubation period usually a higher r p indicates a lower corrosion rate except for the initial value the r p values of eh40 steel in different systems increased over time which indicated a decreased corrosion rate the presence of p aeruginosa decreased r p values in both full and alternate immersion take 14 d for example r p values were reduced by 43 and 44 under full and alternate immersion respectively consequently corrosion of eh40 steel coupons was accelerated by p aeruginosa when the coupons were alternately immersed in abiotic and biotic media r p values dropped 70 90 and 72 92 respectively also demonstrating that the corrosion rate was considerably accelerated by alternate immersion fig s1 exhibits nyquist and bode plots of eh40 steel coupons in different systems at different times and the corresponding eis fitting results table s2 were obtained by the equivalent circuit model fig s2 since the r ct values of all coupons were greater than those of r f corrosion was mainly controlled by charge transfer fig 1d and e a lower r ct value means a higher corrosion rate p aeruginosa decreased r ct in both full and alternate immersion and the r ct values of coupons fully and alternately immersed in abiotic media were 3 fold and 2 fold higher than those in biotic media on day 14 demonstrating that the corrosion promotion of eh40 steel by p aeruginosa was verified again in the sterile environment the r ct values of coupons alternately immersed were 70 80 lower than those of coupons fully immersed suggesting that the corrosion of eh40 steel was accelerated by alternate immersion r ct values of coupons alternately immersed in the biotic medium were minimum indicating the highest corrosion rate the increase in r f values with time in all systems was related to the accumulation of corrosion product films and biofilms the corrosion product films play a major role in r f because of the presence of more than 90 of water in biofilms schmitt and flemming 1999 therefore there were more corrosion products on the surface of coupons of alternate immersion than those of full immersion fig 1f displays the pdp curves of eh40 steel coupons in different systems after immersion for 14 d and the electrochemical parameters derived from the polarization curves including the corrosion potential e corr and corrosion current density i corr are listed in table s3 the i corr value of coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium was 13 3 μa cm 2 which was triple more than that of coupons fully immersed in the abiotic medium 4 1 μa cm 2 suggesting the corrosion was enhanced by p aeruginosa in the abiotic medium the i corr value of coupons of alternate immersion increased by about quintupling compared with that of full immersion and reached 22 1 μa cm 2 indicating corrosion was enhanced by alternate immersion the samples alternately exposed to the biotic medium showed the most negative corrosion potential accompanied by the highest i corr values of 30 2 μa cm 2 all the electrochemical data above both thermodynamic and kinetic are in good accordance with the results of weight loss 3 3 corrosion morphology analysis fig 2 a d and a1 d1 depict images of coupons exposed to different systems for 7 and 14 d respectively fig 2a2 d2 shows the morphology of coupons with 14 d of immersion after biofilms and corrosion products were removed only a few granular corrosion products were present on the surface of coupons fully immersed in the sterile medium and they increased over time fig 2a a1 the scratches from rubbing were observed on the metal surface with the corrosion products removed fig 2a2 after 7 d of immersion there were a lot of sessile cells on the surface of coupons fully immersed in the biotic medium accompanied by a few extracellular polymeric substances eps fig 2b the sessile cells eps and more corrosion products clustered together over time resulting in a thicker film covering most of the surface of coupons fig 2b1 there were no pristine polishing lines after the removal of films and general corrosion was observed on the surface fig 2b2 the coupons alternately exposed to the abiotic medium were covered with many fluffy corrosion products with cracks from drying fig 2c c1 more serious general corrosion was observed after removing corrosion products and there was a more obvious bumpy texture caused by corrosion on the coupons fig 2c2 a lot of loose clusters consisting of the corrosion products and the sessile cells were observed on the coupons of alternate immersion in the biotic medium fig 2d d1 the surface showed more severe corrosion with some corrosion pits after the removal of corrosion products fig 2d2 the sem results were consistent with the weight loss and electrochemical results 3 4 corrosion products analysis figure s3 shows the high resolution fe 2p3 2 xps spectra of coupons in different systems after immersion of 14 d and the binding energy be values and the relative contents rcs of corresponding compounds are shown in table 2 the main components were fe metal fe3o4 fe2o3 and feooh and their binding energies were 709 5 710 6 711 7 and 713 2 ev respectively li et al 2022b the higher rc of fe metal indicated weaker corrosion which is consistent with the weight loss and electrochemical results the rcs of fe3o4 on coupons of full and alternate immersion in the sterile media were 30 and 32 while these in the presence of p aeruginosa increased to 46 and 40 respectively feooh is more likely to transform into fe3o4 under a low do level huang and zhang 2015 due to the consumption of oxygen by p aeruginosa the content of do in the inner rust layer was low which might cause the higher rc of fe3o4 and lower rc of feooh in the biotic medium 3 5 biofilm and cell counting analysis fig 3 displays images of biofilms on coupons fully and alternately immersed in the biotic medium and fig 4 a shows the number of sessile cells at different times after immersion for 3 7 and 14 d the thickness of biofilms on coupons of full immersion was 8 11 and 23 μm respectively and the corresponding number of sessile cells was 5 2 107 1 2 107 and 3 5 106 cells cm2 the biofilm thickness increased over time while the number of live sessile cells in the early stage was higher than that in the later stage similarly under alternate immersion the thickness of biofilms on coupons increased from 18 μm on day 3 to 22 and 30 μm on day 7 and 14 respectively and the corresponding cell number decreased from 2 8 107 to 1 2 106 and 3 5 105 cells cm2 the decline of the number of live cells over time was in good accordance with the growth rhythm of bacteria in addition the live sessile cells on coupons of full immersion were more numerous than those of alternate immersion which was due to the environmental stress from alternate immersion 3 6 detection of atp and phenazines atp levels of sessile cells are shown in fig 4b the atp fluctuation revealed that microbial activity varied during different immersion periods higher atp was always detected in sessile cells on coupons of alternate immersion compared to cells on coupons of full immersion which suggested that alternate immersion could improve the physiological activity of sessile cells the activity of sessile cells increased significantly under alternate immersion and decreased slightly under full immersion with the immersion time fig 4c shows the total contents of pyo and pcn in biofilms after 3 7 and 14 d of immersion it was noted that the contents of pcn and pyo in biofilms increased with time both alternate and full immersion but p aeruginosa secreted more phenazines on coupons of alternate immersion in comparison after 14 d of immersion the phenazine contents pcn pyo in biofilms on coupons of alternate immersion increased by 53 which enhanced the mic mediated by eet in addition the contents of pyo were always kept at higher levels than those of pcn indicating that pyo might play a more important role in extracellular electron transfer as a shuttle the expressions of the genes involved in phenazine biosynthesis were also significantly up regulated in sessile cells on coupons of alternate immersion and the relative abundance of these genes was increased over time by the end of 14 d immersion the relative abundance of phzs gene phzh gene and phzm gene in cells on coupons of alternate immersion increased by a factor of 8 10 and 9 respectively fig 4d these results confirmed that the corrosion efficiency of sessile cells on coupons of alternate immersion was higher than that of full immersion 3 7 transcriptomic response of p aeruginosa to alternate immersion stress genes expression of p aeruginosa on coupons of full and alternate immersion were compared to reveal the difference of cells at the transcriptional level a total of 3894 differentially expressed genes degs in p aeruginosa on coupons responded to alternate immersion and the volcano plot illustrated that 2017 and 1877 degs were up and down regulated respectively fig s4 to gain insights into the biological roles of the degs go and kegg enrichment analyses were conducted based on the criteria of padj 0 05 the go database usually divides genes into three different categories known as the biological process bp molecular function mf and cellular component cc fig 5 a shows the top 15 terms the bp category consisted of 4 functional groups related to secondary metabolism and translation the cc category contained 6 functional groups in which most genes were related to cell parts and organelle in the mf category 5 functional groups were predicted and the genes involved in the binding of the small molecule were highly represented twenty four pathways were significantly enriched in kegg with 16 pathways being up regulated fig 5b and 8 pathways being down regulated fig 5c there are large differences in the number of up or down significantly regulated genes in kegg analysis the term biosynthesis of secondary metabolites contained the largest number of genes that were up regulated in p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion which was followed by genes assigned to the categories biosynthesis of cofactors and carbon metabolism in contrast the category abc transporters contained the largest number of genes that were down regulated in p aeruginosa followed by sulfur metabolism these results indicated that the alternate immersion of coupons is caused distinct effects on the metabolism and cellular regulation of p aeruginosa on the surface it was observed that alternate immersion affected the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites of p aeruginosa in biofilms phenazines a kind of secondary metabolite produced by p aeruginosa have important physiological and biochemical functions for regulating eet in mic when coupons were alternately immersed in the biotic medium 9 genes showed significant differences in transcriptional level of which 6 were up regulated and 3 were down regulated table s4 in p aeruginosa the operons including phza1 phza2 phzb1 phzb2 phzg1 and phzg2 were responsible for producing the phenazine 1 carboxylate pca mavrodi et al 2001 subsequently the transformation from pca to pcn and pyo was mediated by three necessary genes including phzh coding phenazine 1 carboxamide pcn phzm and phzs coding pyocyanin pyo and phzs coding 1 oh phenazine 1 oh phz ye et al 2018 the expression of these genes is regulated by two component regulatory systems quorum sensing systems small rnas and environmental factors such as o2 concentration ph iron and heavy metals ye et al 2018 the up regulation of phzm s h genes can promote the production of phenazines from p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion which is consistent with the results of the phenazine concentration in biofilms fig 4c the expression level of three key genes related to phenazine biosynthesis was verified by rt qpcr and exhibited the same up regulated trend with the transcriptome results fig 4d phenazines have been reported to mediate inward eet by carrying electrons to cells in their reduced form huang et al 2020 zhou et al 2022a the eh40 steel surface acting as the electron donor releases electrons to convert extracellular oxidized phenazines into their reduced forms electrons carried by reduced phenazines are transferred to the interior of cells and consumed in the intracellular redox reactions during which the phenazines turn into an oxidized state and diffuse to the extracellular environment the electron transfer is from substances with low e 0 to substances with higher e 0 the e 0 of pyo the major phenazine produced p aeruginosa is 34 mv versus the standard hydrogen electrode at ph 7 price whelan et al 2007 the potential is high enough to allow the generation of fe2 e 0 447 mv vs she and low enough to provide electrons to various high potential oxidants the reduced pyo in cells can enter the electron transport chain through organic substances with high potential such as ubiquinone e 0 45 mv vs she to participate in energy generation or participate in some reverse processes in the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle to promote metabolism such as the reduction of fumarate to succinate e 0 33 mv vs she li et al 2021 the positive bioelectric potential of the redox reaction coupling pyo oxidation with intracellular substance reduction indicates that the redox reaction of inward eet is thermodynamically favorable the alternate immersion of coupons affected the tca cycle of p aeruginosa in biofilms and promoted the expression of genes coding these key enzymes table s4 in addition the genes encoding enzymes in the electron transport chain including nadh dehydrogenase cytochrome c oxidase and genes coding atp synthase were up regulated in p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion table s4 generally the activity of electron transport would contribute to the formation of the cellular proton motive force and facilitate atp generation via the membrane bound atp synthase which was also verified by atp contents fig 4b furthermore the alternate immersion of coupons induced significant up regulation of key genes associated with bacterial motility there are 10 genes coding flagellar components and 10 related to flagellar motor rotation were up regulated table s4 the flagellar can be divided into three structural components the hook the basal body and the filament the up regulation of flagellum genes enhanced the motor rotation of the flagellum to drive bacteria toward favorable and away from harmful conditions caused by alternate immersion four chemotaxis genes were up regulated including the aerotaxis receptor aer which monitors cellular oxygen and redox potential garcia et al 2016 bacterial chemotaxis and motility require high energy and this response could be correlated with higher levels of energy being available for p aeruginosa which was consistent with the increase of metabolic activities and with the up regulation in gene expression related to energy production tambalo et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 the cell motility was promoted as chemotaxis and the flagella associated genes expression was strengthened which was important for bacterial growth and stress responses collectively these events of the increase in phenazines and atp production the enhancement of gene expression of enzymes involved in the tca cycle and oxidative phosphorylation all strongly supported that alternate immersion promoted the ability of bacteria to corrode metabolize and generate energy 4 discussion the results indicated that p aeruginosa promoted corrosion under the simulated full immersion zone which mainly occurred in the early stage in the later period of full immersion the surface of coupons was covered with a film composed of corrosion products and bacteria preventing the infiltration of corrosive ions and dissolved oxygen thereby inhibiting damage to the steel wang et al 2022a in addition with the increase of time the decline of the activity and number of sessile cells also slowed down the corrosion of p aeruginosa to steels in the later period of immersion generally nitrate can be utilized as the terminal electron acceptor in mic of p aeruginosa under restricted oxygen conditions jia et al 2017 and the reactions are as follows 8 2 n o 3 10 e 12 h n 2 6 h 2 o 9 n o 3 8 e 10 h n h 4 3 h 2 o the standard potential differences of reactions 8 and 9 to 1 are 1196 and 749 mv respectively and therefore it is favorable in thermodynamics that fe0 serves as the sole electron donor for the energy production of p aeruginosa with the reduction of nitrate when sessile cells are deprived of organic carbon consequently as a facultative anaerobe p aeruginosa causes the micro environment of the metal surface to be lack of oxygen and organic carbon inducing localized corrosion in the present medium the concentration of nitrate is low ca 1 μg ml 1 which limits the nitrate reduction activity of p aeruginosa sun et al 2022 fig 6 shows the schematic illustration of the mic mechanism caused by p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion the results demonstrated that the corrosion efficiency of p aeruginosa increased with the immersion time previous studies have shown that p aeruginosa promoted stainless steel corrosion by pitting corrosion acceleration which was related to more sessile cells facilitated by more adsorbed organics and a bigger do transfer rate during alternate immersion zhu et al 2022 the rt qpcr transcriptome and detection of phenazines results indicated that the key genes encoding phenazines were up regulated and more phenazines were secreted by sessile cells on the coupons of alternate immersion which promoted the inward eet ability of p aeruginosa to accelerate the corrosion it was apparent that the genes encoding enzymes involved in carbon metabolism oxidative phosphorylation and tca cycle were up regulated under alternate immersion of coupons which increased the electron transfer caused by phenazines and the flow of protons in cells boosting the synthesis of atp in addition due to the low redox potential of phenazines it is possible to directly transfer electrons to oxygen and fe3 besides delivering electrons within a cell zhou et al reported that the reduced pcn could transfer electrons to oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide during the electron transport process leading to the destruction of the passive film zhou et al 2022b when environments lack suitable electron acceptors or the bacteria at the bottom of the biofilm cannot capture enough electron acceptors due to the diffusion limitation and rapid consumption by the biofilm closer to the environment bacteria can transfer electrons to fe3 compounds in the passive films through the conversion of the redox states of pyo and accelerate the pitting corrosion huang et al 2022 in this study compared with the coupons of alternate immersion in the sterile medium more fe3o4 and less fe2o3 and feooh were found on the coupons in the biotic medium table 2 suggesting that fe3 was possibly transformed into fe2 through phenazines in conclusion p aeruginosa was attempting to counteract the alternate immersion stress by enhancing the energy conversion which improved the production of phenazines and the ability of p aeruginosa to obtain energy through eet accelerating the corrosion of eh40 steel 5 conclusions this study investigated the mic behavior of typical marine p aeruginosa and elucidated the corrosion mechanism at the molecular biological level the results indicated that p aeruginosa accelerated the corrosion of eh40 steel and its corrosion efficiency rose over time in the simulated tidal zone which differed from that in the simulated full immersion zone in the simulated tidal zone the responses of p aeruginosa to environmental stress increased its metabolism and energy generation in particular the expression up regulation of genes coding phenazines promoted the secretion of pyo and pcn by p aeruginosa on coupons of alternate immersion which enhanced the eet mic pathway and accelerated the corrosion of eh40 steel in the simulated tidal zone these findings advance understanding of mic in the tidal zone and will assist in assessing the potential risks of microorganisms on marine equipment compared with the laboratory conditions there are few nutrients and more microorganism species in the field marine environments and therefore the mic mechanisms of mixed bacterial strains with limited nutrients will be paid attention to in the future work moreover the availability of traditional corrosion protection methods against the tidal zone corrosion will be evaluated in the presence of microbes and specific protection methods will be designed based on mechanism research data availability statement the raw processed data required to
