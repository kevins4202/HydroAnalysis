24350,various pests which diminish the quality of the fruit have a big influence on the organic banana production in the piura region of peru and not only and prevent it from being sold on the international market in this study a framework for facilitating the prediction of the pest incidence in organic banana crops is developed to achieve this a data acquisition system with smart sensors is implemented to monitor the meteorological variables that influence the growth of the pests the proposed framework is utilised for the assessment of various mathematical representations of the pest incidence these models are adapted from population growth functions and built in such way as to predict the behaviour of the insects at non regular time intervals a hybrid approach combining mechanistic and data based methods is utilised for the development of the models both linear and nonlinear dynamic relationships with the temperature are assumed the results show that nonlinear model representations have greater accuracy a fit index of more than 70 which provides a basis for improving pest management actions on the organic banana farms keywords pest control organic banana

production of organic bananas criollo et al 2020 is one of the main suppliers of this product to the american market machovina and feeley 2013 however similar to other cultivated crops the presence of pests and diseases influenced by climate change is one of the main problems afflicting the producers dadrasnia et al 2020 gaitán 2020 with a direct influence on the productivity and quality of the

mathematical representations of the phenomena taking place on the farm are of paramount importance for improving the knowledge and decision making for the banana production these should include e g plant growth thierry et al 2008 murthy 2004 banana fruit production salvacion 2020 plant water relations panigrahi et al 2021 pest incidence and its impact on the plant development cai et al 2019 yan et al 2015 etc as an important factor in ensuring proper and efficient farm management pest monitoring and control systems have been the subject of various studies in the agriculture based literature with examples focused on concepts such as bayesian theory khanal et al 2019 kamrani et al 2020 montesinos lópez et al 2018 fuzzy logic urbieta parrazales et al 2021 paul et al 2021 artificial neural networks anns gomez selvaraj et al 2019 escamilla garcía et al 2020 chaudhary and suri 2021 kujawa and niedbala 2021 etc trends in crop pest prediction focus on machine learning technology such as support vector machine svm techniques kim et al 2014 cai et al 2019 almeyda et al 2020 manrique silupu et al 2021 multiple logistic regression models garrido jurado et al 2011 multiple regression models yan et al 2015 freitez et al 2009 or deep convolutional neural networks cnns gomez selvaraj et al 2019 lakshmi narayanan et al 2022 however although modelling for pest prediction in banana crops is scarce jayasinghe et al 2022 some remarkable works where ai tools have been applied must be mentioned in campos calou et al 2020 neural networks are utilised for the monitoring yellow sigatoka in banana crops with 99 61 accuracy the main disadvantage of this approach is that unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipment with a high resolution rgb camera is necessary often not easily affordable for small and medium agro producers commonly encountered in the organic banana production a combination of multi sensor network system and svm techniques is used in cai et al 2019 to build an early warning model of pests in vegetables based on the information collected in a multi dimensional way on the number of pests soil environment ecological climate and meteorological factors in real time this enables a big data system with a high level of accuracy precision and sensitivity due to the flexibility of the neural networks in modelling nonlinear dependencies at the same time the implementation of such a system requires a large amount of data which implies the need for several years of data collection or automated data collection systems for pest inspection cai et al 2019 an early prediction system of black sigatoka outbreak in banana plantations is developed using techniques such as linear regression multivariable regression regression trees and additive regression resulting in a predictive model that can determine the optimum timing of fungicide application to counteract disease effect but without detailed analysis of model accuracy obtained with improved validation methods freitez et al 2009 in almeyda et al 2020 a pest prediction model for banana crops is obtained using linear regression and svm techniques both alternatives are evaluated and compared and a model with high accuracy and sensitivity that does not require a large amount of data is obtained however only the application of a classifier with two classes is possible implying the need to implement an improved classification approach which will enable the pest control action to be determined more accurately in manrique silupu et al 2021 an attempt is made to incorporate a linearization of the exponential population growth behaviour of the red rust thrips to improve the fit of the support vector regression svr however the results did not confirm this assumption for the whole set of data available as the behaviour of the pests seems to differ during the spring season based on these results the main challenges identified in the development of predictive systems for early warning in pests is to provide a model for the population growth behaviour as a continuous output variable enabling the computation of the most appropriate control actions over the whole year and to ensure that this tool is developed in such was as to reduce the operation and maintenance costs for the agro producers additionally previous work on modelling for pest prediction in agricultural crops focuses exclusively on the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches without using any physical understanding that may be available on the insect behaviour or other related phenomena taking place on the farm this is one of the reasons why in many of the cases the resulting models are inaccurate or are not able to predict the insect growth for all the range of conditions machine learning are usually considered black box solutions which can greatly benefit from combination with physics based mechanistic models bikmukhametov and jäschke 2020 furthermore this hybrid approach of integrating deterministic and machine learning based models is advantageous for situations where limited amounts of data is available in which case the first principles understanding can help the machine learning approaches yuan et al 2020 in the field of biology models based on differential functions have been developed to describe the behaviour of bacterial population growth considering the effect of antibiotics thus enabling the development of tools with predictive capabilities duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 the data on the incidence of the banana pests manifest a similar exponential growth as it will be shown in the following sections moreover pest control measures typically applied on a banana farm have the effect of reducing the insect number in a similar way that antibiotics reduce bacterial populations thus this contribution proposes a modular framework for the assessment of the pest incidence in organic banana crops that can facilitate decision making for agro producers worldwide and integrating physical understanding and data based approaches further requirements include avoiding the use of high tech equipment and associated high prices that cannot be afforded by the typical organic banana producers as well as easy implementation in the medium term or in other words requiring little data for training and validation the framework includes modules for data acquisition and storage data processing and mathematical modelling and simulation to eliminate the drawbacks of previous studies first principles models of population growth in insect species with roots in bacterial population models and accounting for the pest development characteristics are considered regression based machine learning approaches are used for estimating the parameters of the proposed models moreover both linear and nonlinear dependency of the growth rates on atmospheric variables such as the temperature are included furthermore the models also consider the effect of pest control actions such as pesticide spraying and plot cleaning elements that have not been included in previous studies but are shown to influence the insect growth 2 material and methods the pest incidence assessment framework fig 1 consists of 3 modules 1 a knowledge database which combines both historical and current weather and crop data as well as state of the art agricultural models 2 modelling tools for developing and updating the models in the database as new knowledge and information experimental data are acquired 3 visualisation and decision making tools to enable the user e g scientist organic banana producer to assess the pest incidence and take the appropriate action e g model discrimination pest control action respectively this system has a low purchase and implementation cost to enable the small agro producers belonging to associations to finance it with the help of e g government programmes furthermore the operation and maintenance costs of the system which include the cost of the internet service required for the connection the annual cost of the data hosting service and the yearly maintenance cost of the equipment is also kept as low as possible the proposed framework is detailed and its application investigated in the following sections for the discrimination between various models of pest incidence that consider the inclusion of atmospheric variables and pest control actions in the representation of the exponential growth functions 2 1 experimental set up for data acquisition the data acquisition module for the framework presented in fig 1 is composed of a network of smart sensors table 1 with a wireless data transmission system that monitors meteorological and microclimate variables at three different levels soil below the leaves of the banana plants microclimate and above the leaves of the banana plants climate this system is installed in a banana crop plot with an area of 1 hectare located in the district of buenos aires province of morropón department of piura peru with the geographical coordinates 5 16 13 4 s 79 57 10 1 w the smart sensor network consists of two nodes and a weather station as shown in fig 2 the weather station has 6 sensors and a microcontroller card as well as two cellular radio modem systems for internet connection and radio mesh for the receiving nodes fig 3 the variables monitored in real time are the atmospheric temperature the relative humidity the solar radiation the wind speed the rainfall rate and the atmospheric pressure the measured data is uploaded to a cloud web server to be used for further processing furthermore the network uses a solar power system consisting of a solar panel and a solar battery thus the equipment is able to operate without solar charge for up to 4 weeks fig 4 shows the weather station installed on the plot the nodes are composed of 4 sensors one sensor at microclimate level which monitors air temperature and relative humidity of the air below the leaves of the plants and three sensors at soil level at different depths each of them monitoring the soil temperature the relative humidity and the electro conductivity of the medium finally the main structure where the weather station is installed contains the gateway which has two communication channels by serial connection and radio waves using these channels the measurements are received from the weather station and the nodes 2 2 pest incidence for the diagnosis of the infection level in the crop plots the pest incidence a statistical metric resulting from the visual inspection of the crop is recorded as well to enable this a defined number of plants per hectare are chosen randomly and examined for the presence of the pests in their stems and leaves the pest incidence α pasapera cordova 2013 is determined using the following equation 1 α total of insects total of plants inspected based on the value of α a corresponding control action is determined which follows the criteria shown in table 2 according to this classification the agro producer applies pest control products the rotation of these compounds is important to prevent insects from generating resistance which is why avoiding excessive use is one of the main challenges in pest control sparks and nauen 2015 additionally information such as pest type plot inspected date of inspection etc is recorded manually as well to be used in the modelling and decision making tasks 2 3 data pre processing the data acquisition module defined in section 2 1 records measurements of the variables at a 1 minute time interval the gateway receives these measurements and stores them in its memory for a period of 15 min during this period the maximum minimum and average values for all the monitored variables as well as variables that are not measured directly e g dewpoint evapotranspiration heat index etc but estimated using arithmetic operations and differential calculus are recorded the gateway then transmits the data to the web server at 15 min intervals which means that during one day of operation the values of the monitored variables are updated 96 times thus a great amount of data is available for analysis to be used for analysis model development decision making or for other tasks concerning the organic banana production however to be able to use them properly a pre treatment of these measured data is required the computational algorithms used to develop the various decision making tools require calculation of the relevant variables for the generation of specific databases the variables that are not necessary for the envisaged applications are discarded and the indices are optimised reducing the use of memory and increasing the speed of the computations according to the literature the most important variables for evaluating the efficiency in precision agriculture are the ambient temperature relative humidity rainfall and wind speed elbehri et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 fig 5 shows the data obtained from the visual inspections carried out as described in section 2 1 on the organic banana plot for the incidence behaviour of red rust thrips chaetanaphothrips signipennis over time from december 2019 to april 2021 during the months of january february and march which correspond to the summer season in the region of piura peru there is an accelerated growth this confirms the information collected from the agro producers asserting the seasonal behaviour of this pest 2 4 mathematical modelling in the following the application of the framework described previously is applied for the development of mathematical models for the incidence of pests in organic banana crops to this end the modelling tools module will be developed to include both mechanistic and data based machine learning approaches as shown in fig 6 from the analysis of the growth of the red rust thrips in fig 5 it can be observed that the population growth resembles an exponential function which coincides with the bacterial population growth under ideal conditions esteva et al 2011 thus the population of pests i e red rust thrips in the example investigated here is defined as a function of time in the following way 2 i t t i t 0 e r t where i t 0 initial population of thrips insects plant r effective population growth rate 1 day t time since the date that the initial population was measured days the derivative of the population function can be calculated as 3 d i t t d t r i t 0 e r t eq 2 is replaced in eq 3 the derivative can be written in a more compact form as 4 d i t t d t r i t t based on this the pest population growth is modelled using an exponential growth function the growth ratio r in eq 4 depends on variables such as the atmospheric and micro climate conditions e g temperature as well as on the level of cleanliness of the plot the concentration of the pesticides applied etc previous studies on modelling of the tobacco caterpillar on soybean consider the effect of temperature on the development of insect species prasad et al 2021 however in the case of the banana red rust thrips the analysis of the data presented in fig 5 leads to the conclusion that the growth rate is influenced by other parameters such as the natural growth and mortality of the species the concentration of the chemicals used for fumigation and the cleanliness of the plots consequently the effective growth rate is defined further as 5 r β μ α 1 f 1 α 2 f 2 γ c where β natural population growth rate 1 day μ natural causes mortality rate 1 day α 1 mortality rate caused by thrips fumigation 1 day α 2 mortality rate caused by other species fumigation 1 day γ mortality rate caused by cleanliness of the plot 1 day f 1 concentration of spraying chemical for red rust thrips f 2 concentration of spraying chemical for other pests c theoretical level of cleanliness the term β in eq 5 is defined from models for the development of the insects and is often defined as a function of temperature prasad et al 2021 ikemoto 2005 duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 for the model development stage of the red rust thrips three different natural population growth rate representations are considered based on the campbell model the sharpe schoolfield ikemoto ssi model ikemoto 2005 and the logan model duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 respectively these models are further detailed in section 2 4 1 the thrips incidence is calculated as described in eq 1 in section 2 2 for pest control there are three types of solutions that are used in the organic banana production sulphocalcic broth a mixture of sulphocalcic broth and agricultural oil and entrust sc a natural insecticide produced through fermentation of naturally occurring soil bacteria as an important part of the new mathematical representation defined in eq 5 the dates of spraying with insecticide and cleaning of the plot need to be monitored and recorded in the database together with the number of pests to this end the typical data acquisition procedures of the producer association are updated such that registers are kept detailing the incidence of pests as well as fumigation and cleaning dates in chronological order to define the concentration of the fumigation chemicals differential equations based on the description of the antibiotic concentration in bacterial population growth tests are used esteva et al 2011 which have been modified as follows 6 d f i d t ϕ f i f i with i 1 2 where f i is the concentration of the fumigation chemical with the subscripts 1 and 2 corresponding to the pesticide used against red rust thrips and against other species of pests respectively and ϕ f i is the degradation rate of the chemical integrating this differential equation yields a function that enables the computation of the concentration of the chemical from the last fumigation 7 f i t 1 t 2 ϕ f i f i d t e ϕ f i t 2 t 1 where t 1 is the date of the last fumigation and t 2 is the current date while t 2 t 1 is represented in days 2 4 1 natural insect population growth rate in order to assess the rate of insect development as well as to enable the comparison between various model representations the natural insect population growth rate is modelled starting from state of the art models the three options considered in this study are the campbell the ssi ikemoto 2005 and the logan duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 models a the campbell model the campbell model is a linear approximation of the rate of development in insects where the population growth is correlated to the environmental temperature prasad et al 2021 and is defined as 8 β a b t where a intercept of the pests growth 1 day b slope correlating the growth of the pests with temperature 1 day c as this function has only two parameters needed for the estimation and requires less computational time for its solution its application is advantageous for use in determination of fumigation cleaning schedules a the ssi model the ssi model uses the accumulated degree days defined as the excess of temperature over the minimum temperature value for the development of the species therefore the population growth in addition to having a linear relationship with temperature must also comply with the fact that the temperature must be higher than a minimum value t m i n ikemoto 2005 9 β t t m i n k where t average daily temperature c t m i n minimum temperature c k thermal constant in degree days c the t t m i n term represents the accumulated degree days obtained by subtracting the minimum temperature value needed for the survival of the species from the average temperature by day a the logan model logan s model considers that there is an optimum and a maximum temperature at which the number of insects increases furthermore it assumes that this number reaches its peak value when the temperature is equal to the optimum value once this value is exceeded the number of pests decreases and becomes 0 at the maximum temperature duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 the following expression is utilised for the growth rate of insects in this case 10 β ψ e ρ t e ρ t m t m t t m t o where ψ base growth rate 1 day ρ slope that relates growth to temperature 1 c t m maximum temperature c t o optimum temperature c for which the maximum growth is achieved 2 5 solution algorithms and software implementation once different models are available in the knowledge database for representing the insect population growth various algorithms for determining estimating the different model parameters as well as for the solution verification and validation of the resulting models are included for determining the model parameters it is necessary to perform a multi period integration of eq 4 to match the values of the pest incidence obtained during the field inspection for this purpose in the case study of the red rust thrips the mean squared error mse is defined as the objective function so that minimizing this value yields the optimized model parameters an illustration of the optimization procedure is presented in fig 7 according to the application and or case study different other objective functions may be considered e g cost function etc in the next step the experimental data is divided after the pre processing described in section 2 3 into training and validation sets depending on the model implementation and the solution tools utilised various approaches may be considered included in the knowledge database for this goal for the purpose of the example considered here the different algorithms described in this paper are implemented in python due to its large library of algorithms for tasks such as data processing integration optimization etc as well as it being freely usable and distributable the groupshufflesplit gss method ojala and garriga 2010 of the sci kit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 which provides randomized train test indices to the split data is used for dividing the experimental data an optimization algorithm is needed to determine the parameters of the model in this case study the minimize algorithm from the scipy optimize package available in python is utilised 2 5 1 cross validation given the stochastic nature in the construction of the training and validation data sets the parameters of the models themselves and the results will not be always the same as a consequence at each execution of the optimization algorithm different levels of accuracy and modelling error will be obtained for this reason a cross validation step is performed on the input data to obtain the best results in terms of quality of the prediction of the models a cross validation procedure based on split of the experimental data into training and test sets is utilised during the parameter estimation stage followed by a separate validation step using new data i e not used during model development thus in the following the cross validation set will be called the test set while the new data used for the extra validation step will be called the validation set the cross validation procedure is illustrated in fig 8 leaveonegroupout is a cross validation scheme available in the sci kit learn python library that retains samples according to a matrix of integer groups this group information can be used to encode predefined domain specific cross validation folds thus each training set consists of all samples except for those related to a specific group the shufflesplit iterator will generate a user defined number of independent splits of the training test data set the samples are first shuffled and then split into a pair of training and test sets the groupshufflesplit iterator behaves as a combination of shufflesplit and leaveonegroupout generates a sequence of random partitions in which a subset of groups is kept for each split in this research the groupshufflesplit method is used to generate the cross validation sets fig 9 and metric results are stored with each of the training and test sets to perform a statistical analysis and define optimal parameter values the best model obtained can then be used on the experimental data in the validated set to verify the model prediction power 3 results and discussion table 3 shows the parameters to be estimated in each model available in the database as discussed in section 2 4 for determining the growth of the insects for this objective a total of 113 data points fig 5 randomly divided into 100 training and test sets are used splitting into more than 100 sets showed no major improvement in the parameter estimation results for the final validation step 11 points collected from april to june 2021 are used the results of the cross validation enable the comparison between the different mathematical alternatives considered and the confirmation of their feasibility metrics such as the coefficient of determination r 2 adjusted coefficient of determination r a d j 2 and the root mean square error rmse are used to determine which model has a better fit and lowest error 3 1 the campbell model the results of the parameter estimation stage fig 10 for the first model option the campbell model show that for the 100 randomly generated sets the standard deviation is very small in most of the parameters fig 11 shows the influence of the terms that are determining the effective growth rate for the model that gives the best results for the training and test sets considered during this step the influence of the cleaning coefficient is zero as this is a linear function variation at a lower temperature could cause the growth rate to become negative in normal conditions only the effect of the mortality due to natural causes and the natural population growth rate can be observed in winter due to the decrease in ambient temperature the population growth rate reduces its effect which implies that the population of thrips will begin to reduce as well at the end of the individual analysis of the model the model predictions results for the 100 sets have been plotted against the experimental data in fig 12 the average value has been plotted with a blue line and the red margin represents the standard deviation for the prediction of each point moreover the dates at which fumigation and cleaning has been performed on the plot are represented by vertical lines as shown in fig 12 the error in the prediction of the thrips incidence is small in the case of the campbell model at the points with intermediate and low incidence values and increases for high incidence values and the dates following shortly after fumigation 3 2 the ssi model in contrast to the campbell model there is a better reference for the initial values of the parameters in the case of the ssi linear model the minimum temperature is 11 c for species similar to the red rust thrips murai 2000 mcdonald et al 1999 ganaha kikumura and kijima 2016 yadav and chang 2014 the results in the distribution of the r 2 values for the training sets show a greater dispersion compared to those obtained for the campbell model the error bars in the estimation of the parameters fig 13 show similar results in magnitude for the parameters that represent causes of mortality for the parameters that make up the linear ssi function there is a higher standard deviation in the case of the minimum temperature fig 14 shows the influence of the growth rate components which exhibits a similar behaviour as in the case of the campbell model since both models are linear like in the previous case the effect of cleaning is zero the spraying has an effect of 60 in the first days after the application of the fumigation agent and reduces exponentially although its effect remains over a period of several weeks fig 15 shows that the prediction error for medium and low values of the thrips incidence is smaller compared to the higher incidence values furthermore for the days after the fumigation larger errors are observed as well the reason for this behaviour is that the hyperparameters making up the growth rate are quite sensitive and because an exponential function is utilised to model the population growth a small variation in these values can result in large changes in the peak values of the function 3 3 the logan model unlike the campbell and the ssi models which are both linear the standard deviation of the parameter values in the estimation of the nonlinear logan model fig 16 is much smaller this means that there is a greater stability in the model and the absolute minimum of the cost function does exist for this model the spraying with pest control agents for other species and the cleanliness of the plot have a considerable influence on the effective population growth rate fig 17 while the behaviour under normal conditions is quite similar to the campbell and ssi models the prediction error fig 18 follows the same trend as the previous models but the error in the peaks of the incidence of the thrips for the logan model is lower compared to the two linear models 3 4 model comparison fig 19 illustrates the behaviour of the population growth as a function of temperature for each of the models investigated in the previous section as can be seen the nonlinearity of the logan s model could be used to predict the behaviour of the growth of the population of thrips more accurately tables 4 and 5 shows the average results in terms of r2 and rmse for the training and test sets on which it can be concluded that the logan and campbell models perform better in training and testing it should be mentioned that the campbell model is simpler to implement which facilitates its use for decision making applications such as optimization or scheduling of pest control actions as can be seen in fig 19 the linear models can have negative growth values and have a higher positive slope compared to the nonlinear logan model this could explain why the error margins in the campbell and ssi models illustrated in figs 15 and 18 respectively are larger additionally the results for the best trained ensembles are shown parameters values are summarised in the appendix for a better understanding of the difference in the behaviour of the various models investigated when choosing the best model for each of the three cases considered fig 20 the alternatives that have the r 2 value table 6 in the training set greater than the mean and the r 2 value in the test set close to the mean are selected in this way overfitting is avoided and the model can accurately predict points for which it did not have information during training the rmse values for these models are summarised in table 7 from the results in fig 20 the benefits of using a hybrid modelling approach which combines first principles with data based approaches become clear making use of the physical understanding on the population growth and flexibly implementing appropriate mathematical relationships e g linear nonlinear for the growth rates significantly improve the accuracy of the model predictions over the whole year this removes the challenge encountered in the previous work done by manrique silupu et al 2021 where only machine learning techniques were studied of not being able to accurately predict the behaviour of the pests during the spring season all models achieve high r 2 values with differences within a 10th of percent figs 21 22 23 illustrate how the population growth rate varies with the temperature during the year the linear models campbell and ssi exhibit a similar behaviour and the graphs always coincide while for the logan model the growth rate differs during the summer months the effective growth rate for each model is shown in fig 24 it can be observed that the campbell and the ssi models show quite a similar behaviour while the logan model shows a significant influence of fumigation with agent 2 f2 which is the fumigation agent for other pests than the red rust thrips the parameter estimation task described previously was attempted with 500 sets generated with the gss algorithm but the results of the three model alternatives discussed above did not vary considerably versus the results where 100 sets were considered the validation results of the models obtained for a separate data set corresponding to measurements taken between april 2021 and july 2021 not used in any of the model development phases discussed above will provide more information on the accuracy of the model alternatives available and whether they can be used for forecasting applications from these data as shown in fig 25 the logan model predictions are closer to the experimental points which is confirmed by the r 2 and rmse values shown in table 8 4 conclusions and future work the paper presents the development of a decision making framework for the prediction of the incidence of pests in agricultural crops its application is illustrated on the red thrips of organic banana cultures more specifically on the development and selection of a mathematical model for assessing the incidence of the thrips based on weather and micro climate data in order to eliminate the disadvantages of previous work which focused only on machine learning techniques to assess the development of the insects a combined first principles and regression based machine learning approach is implemented firstly knowledge on the population growth of the pests is considered starting from model representations proposed in the literature for the bacterial growth modified to account for the particularities of the insects as well as climatic and operating conditions on an organic banana farm in the depiction of the behaviour of the thrips a new definition is used for the growth rate that takes into account not only the natural life cycle of the pests but the influence of pest management actions such as the fumigation or cleaning of the banana plot as well furthermore models based on previous work campbell ssi and logan are used to define the natural growth rate of the insects secondly once this representation based on the physical understanding of the system is available regression based approaches are implemented for estimating the various model parameters using the experimental data available the application of the framework for the incidence of red thrips in organic banana crops shows improved accuracy of the resulting models versus previous work exclusively focused on machine learning approaches further demonstrating the benefit of including the knowledge and physical understanding of the insect behaviour in the mathematical representation of the system on the type of first principles models to be used the results show that the implementation of models with a linear relationship based on temperature campbell and ssi although able to provide a physical meaning for the considered variables and offer sufficient understanding of the abiotic components and spread of the pests do not correctly describe the pest behaviour across the whole temperature range however linear models can prove able to provide sufficiently accurate solutions in a reasonable amount of time for cases when a large number of iterative computations of the pest incidence are required for the current version of the model developed using data from the region of piura in peru the inclusion of other atmospheric variables e g wind speed rain fall etc was not considered due to the limited amount of data available e g only one data point with precipitation available for the period considered in the analysis nonetheless for other regions with organic banana crops the inclusion of these variables in the assessment is needed to improve the predictive accuracy of the tools the selected models can be further used in the development of tools for pest management which can enable the estimation of the increase of the thrips population in a banana crop with a small margin of error this would imply a reduction in plot inspection costs and would be much easier to implement compared to current techniques based on image processing this work is a starting point towards the development of new methodologies and decision making tools for boosting the artisanal agricultural industry which can provide a high quality product but cannot compete with highly industrialized processes since a greater amount of information will be obtained from the data acquisition system and the digitized pest registration system using the framework described here the decision making tools can be easily extended to the behaviour of other pests e g black sigatoka mycoshpaerella fijiensis west indian weevil metamasius hemipterus banana weevil cosmopolites sordidus etc that impact the organic banana production and for which data is already available in the database furthermore the approach is sufficiently generic to be applied for organic banana crops located in other regions of the world the proposed tools are implemented with the intention of improving the quality of production of the organic banana farmers in the region of piura and to facilitate monitoring and data collection allowing new projects to be initiated starting with the models developed in this contribution the optimum scheduling of fumigation and cleaning actions can be implemented to minimize the use of chemicals reduce the cost and increase the profit margin without affecting the quality of the final product as the current data acquisition system has information on the humidity of the soil modules for the monitoring control and scheduling of irrigation actions on the organic banana farm can be easily implemented and used further developments will include tools for the monitoring and scheduling of fertilizing actions as well however in this case besides the need for model representations of such processes additional sensing devices for the concentration of components such as c n p in the soil need to be installed in the data acquisition system credit authorship contribution statement jean c campos methodology software

24350,various pests which diminish the quality of the fruit have a big influence on the organic banana production in the piura region of peru and not only and prevent it from being sold on the international market in this study a framework for facilitating the prediction of the pest incidence in organic banana crops is developed to achieve this a data acquisition system with smart sensors is implemented to monitor the meteorological variables that influence the growth of the pests the proposed framework is utilised for the assessment of various mathematical representations of the pest incidence these models are adapted from population growth functions and built in such way as to predict the behaviour of the insects at non regular time intervals a hybrid approach combining mechanistic and data based methods is utilised for the development of the models both linear and nonlinear dynamic relationships with the temperature are assumed the results show that nonlinear model

production of organic bananas criollo et al 2020 is one of the main suppliers of this product to the american market machovina and feeley 2013 however similar to other cultivated crops the presence of

mathematical representations of the phenomena taking place on the farm are of paramount importance for improving the knowledge and decision making for the banana production these should include e g plant growth thierry et al 2008 murthy 2004 banana fruit production salvacion 2020 plant water relations panigrahi et al 2021 pest incidence and its impact on the plant development cai et al 2019 yan et al 2015 etc as an important factor in ensuring proper and efficient farm management pest monitoring and control systems have been the subject of various studies in the agriculture based literature with examples focused on concepts such as bayesian theory khanal et al 2019 kamrani et al 2020 montesinos lópez et al 2018 fuzzy logic urbieta parrazales et al 2021 paul et al 2021 artificial neural networks anns gomez selvaraj et al 2019 escamilla garcía et al 2020 chaudhary and suri 2021 kujawa and niedbala 2021 etc trends in crop pest prediction focus on machine learning technology such as support vector machine svm techniques kim et al 2014 cai et al 2019 almeyda et al 2020 manrique silupu et al 2021 multiple logistic regression models garrido jurado et al 2011 multiple regression models yan et al 2015 freitez et al 2009 or deep convolutional neural networks cnns gomez selvaraj et al 2019 lakshmi narayanan et al 2022 however although modelling for pest prediction in banana crops is scarce jayasinghe et al 2022 some remarkable works where ai tools have been applied must be mentioned in campos calou et al 2020 neural networks are utilised for the monitoring yellow sigatoka in banana crops with 99 61 accuracy the main disadvantage of this approach is that unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipment with a high resolution rgb camera is necessary often not easily affordable for small and medium agro producers commonly encountered in the organic banana production a combination of multi sensor network system and svm techniques is used in cai et al 2019 to build an early warning model of pests in vegetables based on the information collected in a multi dimensional way on the number of pests soil environment ecological climate and meteorological factors in real time this enables a big data system with a high level of accuracy precision and sensitivity due to the flexibility of the neural networks in modelling nonlinear dependencies at the same time the implementation of such a system requires a large amount of data which implies the need for several years of data collection or automated data collection systems for pest inspection cai et al 2019 an early prediction system of black sigatoka outbreak in banana plantations is developed using techniques such as linear regression multivariable regression regression trees and additive regression resulting in a predictive model that can determine the optimum timing of fungicide application to counteract disease effect but without detailed analysis of model accuracy obtained with improved validation methods freitez et al 2009 in almeyda et al 2020 a pest prediction model for banana crops is obtained using linear regression and svm techniques both alternatives are evaluated and compared and a model with high accuracy and sensitivity that does not require a large amount of data is obtained however only the application of a classifier with two classes is possible implying the need to implement an improved classification approach which will enable the pest control action to be determined more accurately in manrique silupu et al 2021 an attempt is made to incorporate a linearization of the exponential population growth behaviour of the red rust thrips to improve the fit of the support vector regression svr however the results did not confirm this assumption for the whole set of data available as the behaviour of the pests seems to differ during the spring season based on these results the main challenges identified in the development of predictive systems for early warning in pests is to provide a model for the population growth behaviour as a continuous output variable enabling the computation of the most appropriate control actions over the whole year and to ensure that this tool is developed in such was as to reduce the operation and maintenance costs for the agro producers additionally previous work on modelling for pest prediction in agricultural crops focuses exclusively on the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches without using any physical understanding that may be available on the insect behaviour or other related phenomena taking place on the farm this is one of the reasons why in many of the cases the resulting models are inaccurate or are not able to predict the insect growth for all the range of conditions machine learning are usually considered black box solutions which can greatly benefit from combination with physics based mechanistic models bikmukhametov and jäschke 2020 furthermore this hybrid approach of integrating deterministic and machine learning based models is advantageous for situations where limited amounts of data is available in which case the first principles understanding can help the machine learning approaches yuan et al 2020 in the field of biology models based on differential functions have been developed to describe the behaviour of bacterial population growth considering the effect of antibiotics thus enabling the development of tools with predictive capabilities duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 the data on the incidence of the banana pests manifest a similar exponential growth as it will be shown in the following sections moreover pest control measures typically applied on a banana farm have the effect of reducing the insect number in a similar way that antibiotics reduce bacterial populations thus this contribution proposes a modular framework for the assessment of the pest incidence in organic banana crops that can facilitate decision making for agro producers worldwide and integrating physical understanding and data based approaches further requirements include avoiding the use of high tech equipment and associated high prices that cannot be afforded by the typical organic banana producers as well as easy implementation in the medium term or in other words requiring little data for training and validation the framework includes modules for data acquisition and storage data processing and mathematical modelling and simulation to eliminate the drawbacks of previous studies first principles models of population growth in insect species with roots in bacterial population models and accounting for the pest development characteristics are considered regression based machine learning approaches are used for estimating the parameters of the proposed models moreover both linear and nonlinear dependency of the growth rates on atmospheric variables such as the temperature are included furthermore the models also consider the effect of pest control actions such as pesticide spraying and plot cleaning elements that have not been included in previous studies but are shown to influence the insect growth 2 material and methods the pest incidence assessment framework fig 1 consists of 3 modules 1 a knowledge database which combines both historical and current weather and crop data as well as state of the art agricultural models 2 modelling tools for developing and updating the models in the database as new knowledge and information experimental data are acquired 3 visualisation and decision making tools to enable the user e g scientist organic banana producer to assess the pest incidence and take the appropriate action e g model discrimination pest control action respectively this system has a low purchase and implementation cost to enable the small agro producers belonging to associations to finance it with the help of e g government programmes furthermore the operation and maintenance costs of the system which include the cost of the internet service required for the connection the annual cost of the data hosting service and the yearly maintenance cost of the equipment is also kept as low as possible the proposed framework is detailed and its application investigated in the following sections for the discrimination between various models of pest incidence that consider the inclusion of atmospheric variables and pest control actions in the representation of the exponential growth functions 2 1 experimental set up for data acquisition the data acquisition module for the framework presented in fig 1 is composed of a network of smart sensors table 1 with a wireless data transmission system that monitors meteorological and microclimate variables at three different levels soil below the leaves of the banana plants microclimate and above the leaves of the banana plants climate this system is installed in a banana crop plot with an area of 1 hectare located in the district of buenos aires province of morropón department of piura peru with the geographical coordinates 5 16 13 4 s 79 57 10 1 w the smart sensor network consists of two nodes and a weather station as shown in fig 2 the weather station has 6 sensors and a microcontroller card as well as two cellular radio modem systems for internet connection and radio mesh for the receiving nodes fig 3 the variables monitored in real time are the atmospheric temperature the relative humidity the solar radiation the wind speed the rainfall rate and the atmospheric pressure the measured data is uploaded to a cloud web server to be used for further processing furthermore the network uses a solar power system consisting of a solar panel and a solar battery thus the equipment is able to operate without solar charge for up to 4 weeks fig 4 shows the weather station installed on the plot the nodes are composed of 4 sensors one sensor at microclimate level which monitors air temperature and relative humidity of the air below the leaves of the plants and three sensors at soil level at different depths each of them monitoring the soil temperature the relative humidity and the electro conductivity of the medium finally the main structure where the weather station is installed contains the gateway which has two communication channels by serial connection and radio waves using these channels the measurements are received from the weather station and the nodes 2 2 pest incidence for the diagnosis of the infection level in the crop plots the pest incidence a statistical metric resulting from the visual inspection of the crop is recorded as well to enable this a defined number of plants per hectare are chosen randomly and examined for the presence of the pests in their stems and leaves the pest incidence α pasapera cordova 2013 is determined using the following equation 1 α total of insects total of plants inspected based on the value of α a corresponding control action is determined which follows the criteria shown in table 2 according to this classification the agro producer applies pest control products the rotation of these compounds is important to prevent insects from generating resistance which is why avoiding excessive use is one of the main challenges in pest control sparks and nauen 2015 additionally information such as pest type plot inspected date of inspection etc is recorded manually as well to be used in the modelling and decision making tasks 2 3 data pre processing the data acquisition module defined in section 2 1 records measurements of the variables at a 1 minute time interval the gateway receives these measurements and stores them in its memory for a period of 15 min during this period the maximum minimum and average values for all the monitored variables as well as variables that are not measured directly e g dewpoint evapotranspiration heat index etc but estimated using arithmetic operations and differential calculus are recorded the gateway then transmits the data to the web server at 15 min intervals which means that during one day of operation the values of the monitored variables are updated 96 times thus a great amount of data is available for analysis to be used for analysis model development decision making or for other tasks concerning the organic banana production however to be able to use them properly a pre treatment of these measured data is required the computational algorithms used to develop the various decision making tools require calculation of the relevant variables for the generation of specific databases the variables that are not necessary for the envisaged applications are discarded and the indices are optimised reducing the use of memory and increasing the speed of the computations according to the literature the most important variables for evaluating the efficiency in precision agriculture are the ambient temperature relative humidity rainfall and wind speed elbehri et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 fig 5 shows the data obtained from the visual inspections carried out as described in section 2 1 on the organic banana plot for the incidence behaviour of red rust thrips chaetanaphothrips signipennis over time from december 2019 to april 2021 during the months of january february and march which correspond to the summer season in the region of piura peru there is an accelerated growth this confirms the information collected from the agro producers asserting the seasonal behaviour of this pest 2 4 mathematical modelling in the following the application of the framework described previously is applied for the development of mathematical models for the incidence of pests in organic banana crops to this end the modelling tools module will be developed to include both mechanistic and data based machine learning approaches as shown in fig 6 from the analysis of the growth of the red rust thrips in fig 5 it can be observed that the population growth resembles an exponential function which coincides with the bacterial population growth under ideal conditions esteva et al 2011 thus the population of pests i e red rust thrips in the example investigated here is defined as a function of time in the following way 2 i t t i t 0 e r t where i t 0 initial population of thrips insects plant r effective population growth rate 1 day t time since the date that the initial population was measured days the derivative of the population function can be calculated as 3 d i t t d t r i t 0 e r t eq 2 is replaced in eq 3 the derivative can be written in a more compact form as 4 d i t t d t r i t t based on this the pest population growth is modelled using an exponential growth function the growth ratio r in eq 4 depends on variables such as the atmospheric and micro climate conditions e g temperature as well as on the level of cleanliness of the plot the concentration of the pesticides applied etc previous studies on modelling of the tobacco caterpillar on soybean consider the effect of temperature on the development of insect species prasad et al 2021 however in the case of the banana red rust thrips the analysis of the data presented in fig 5 leads to the conclusion that the growth rate is influenced by other parameters such as the natural growth and mortality of the species the concentration of the chemicals used for fumigation and the cleanliness of the plots consequently the effective growth rate is defined further as 5 r β μ α 1 f 1 α 2 f 2 γ c where β natural population growth rate 1 day μ natural causes mortality rate 1 day α 1 mortality rate caused by thrips fumigation 1 day α 2 mortality rate caused by other species fumigation 1 day γ mortality rate caused by cleanliness of the plot 1 day f 1 concentration of spraying chemical for red rust thrips f 2 concentration of spraying chemical for other pests c theoretical level of cleanliness the term β in eq 5 is defined from models for the development of the insects and is often defined as a function of temperature prasad et al 2021 ikemoto 2005 duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 for the model development stage of the red rust thrips three different natural population growth rate representations are considered based on the campbell model the sharpe schoolfield ikemoto ssi model ikemoto 2005 and the logan model duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 respectively these models are further detailed in section 2 4 1 the thrips incidence is calculated as described in eq 1 in section 2 2 for pest control there are three types of solutions that are used in the organic banana production sulphocalcic broth a mixture of sulphocalcic broth and agricultural oil and entrust sc a natural insecticide produced through fermentation of naturally occurring soil bacteria as an important part of the new mathematical representation defined in eq 5 the dates of spraying with insecticide and cleaning of the plot need to be monitored and recorded in the database together with the number of pests to this end the typical data acquisition procedures of the producer association are updated such that registers are kept detailing the incidence of pests as well as fumigation and cleaning dates in chronological order to define the concentration of the fumigation chemicals differential equations based on the description of the antibiotic concentration in bacterial population growth tests are used esteva et al 2011 which have been modified as follows 6 d f i d t ϕ f i f i with i 1 2 where f i is the concentration of the fumigation chemical with the subscripts 1 and 2 corresponding to the pesticide used against red rust thrips and against other species of pests respectively and ϕ f i is the degradation rate of the chemical integrating this differential equation yields a function that enables the computation of the concentration of the chemical from the last fumigation 7 f i t 1 t 2 ϕ f i f i d t e ϕ f i t 2 t 1 where t 1 is the date of the last fumigation and t 2 is the current date while t 2 t 1 is represented in days 2 4 1 natural insect population growth rate in order to assess the rate of insect development as well as to enable the comparison between various model representations the natural insect population growth rate is modelled starting from state of the art models the three options considered in this study are the campbell the ssi ikemoto 2005 and the logan duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 models a the campbell model the campbell model is a linear approximation of the rate of development in insects where the population growth is correlated to the environmental temperature prasad et al 2021 and is defined as 8 β a b t where a intercept of the pests growth 1 day b slope correlating the growth of the pests with temperature 1 day c as this function has only two parameters needed for the estimation and requires less computational time for its solution its application is advantageous for use in determination of fumigation cleaning schedules a the ssi model the ssi model uses the accumulated degree days defined as the excess of temperature over the minimum temperature value for the development of the species therefore the population growth in addition to having a linear relationship with temperature must also comply with the fact that the temperature must be higher than a minimum value t m i n ikemoto 2005 9 β t t m i n k where t average daily temperature c t m i n minimum temperature c k thermal constant in degree days c the t t m i n term represents the accumulated degree days obtained by subtracting the minimum temperature value needed for the survival of the species from the average temperature by day a the logan model logan s model considers that there is an optimum and a maximum temperature at which the number of insects increases furthermore it assumes that this number reaches its peak value when the temperature is equal to the optimum value once this value is exceeded the number of pests decreases and becomes 0 at the maximum temperature duarte and zenner de polanía 2009 the following expression is utilised for the growth rate of insects in this case 10 β ψ e ρ t e ρ t m t m t t m t o where ψ base growth rate 1 day ρ slope that relates growth to temperature 1 c t m maximum temperature c t o optimum temperature c for which the maximum growth is achieved 2 5 solution algorithms and software implementation once different models are available in the knowledge database for representing the insect population growth various algorithms for determining estimating the different model parameters as well as for the solution verification and validation of the resulting models are included for determining the model parameters it is necessary to perform a multi period integration of eq 4 to match the values of the pest incidence obtained during the field inspection for this purpose in the case study of the red rust thrips the mean squared error mse is defined as the objective function so that minimizing this value yields the optimized model parameters an illustration of the optimization procedure is presented in fig 7 according to the application and or case study different other objective functions may be considered e g cost function etc in the next step the experimental data is divided after the pre processing described in section 2 3 into training and validation sets depending on the model implementation and the solution tools utilised various approaches may be considered included in the knowledge database for this goal for the purpose of the example considered here the different algorithms described in this paper are implemented in python due to its large library of algorithms for tasks such as data processing integration optimization etc as well as it being freely usable and distributable the groupshufflesplit gss method ojala and garriga 2010 of the sci kit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 which provides randomized train test indices to the split data is used for dividing the experimental data an optimization algorithm is needed to determine the parameters of the model in this case study the minimize algorithm from the scipy optimize package available in python is utilised 2 5 1 cross validation given the stochastic nature in the construction of the training and validation data sets the parameters of the models themselves and the results will not be always the same as a consequence at each execution of the optimization algorithm different levels of accuracy and modelling error will be obtained for this reason a cross validation step is performed on the input data to obtain the best results in terms of quality of the prediction of the models a cross validation procedure based on split of the experimental data into training and test sets is utilised during the parameter estimation stage followed by a separate validation step using new data i e not used during model development thus in the following the cross validation set will be called the test set while the new data used for the extra validation step will be called the validation set the cross validation procedure is illustrated in fig 8 leaveonegroupout is a cross validation scheme available in the sci kit learn python library that retains samples according to a matrix of integer groups this group information can be used to encode predefined domain specific cross validation folds thus each training set consists of all samples except for those related to a specific group the shufflesplit iterator will generate a user defined number of independent splits of the training test data set the samples are first shuffled and then split into a pair of training and test sets the groupshufflesplit iterator behaves as a combination of shufflesplit and leaveonegroupout generates a sequence of random partitions in which a subset of groups is kept for each split in this research the groupshufflesplit method is used to generate the cross validation sets fig 9 and metric results are stored with each of the training and test sets to perform a statistical analysis and define optimal parameter values the best model obtained can then be used on the experimental data in the validated set to verify the model prediction power 3 results and discussion table 3 shows the parameters to be estimated in each model available in the database as discussed in section 2 4 for determining the growth of the insects for this objective a total of 113 data points fig 5 randomly divided into 100 training and test sets are used splitting into more than 100 sets showed no major improvement in the parameter estimation results for the final validation step 11 points collected from april to june 2021 are used the results of the cross validation enable the comparison between the different mathematical alternatives considered and the confirmation of their feasibility metrics such as the coefficient of determination r 2 adjusted coefficient of determination r a d j 2 and the root mean square error rmse are used to determine which model has a better fit and lowest error 3 1 the campbell model the results of the parameter estimation stage fig 10 for the first model option the campbell model show that for the 100 randomly generated sets the standard deviation is very small in most of the parameters fig 11 shows the influence of the terms that are determining the effective growth rate for the model that gives the best results for the training and test sets considered during this step the influence of the cleaning coefficient is zero as this is a linear function variation at a lower temperature could cause the growth rate to become negative in normal conditions only the effect of the mortality due to natural causes and the natural population growth rate can be observed in winter due to the decrease in ambient temperature the population growth rate reduces its effect which implies that the population of thrips will begin to reduce as well at the end of the individual analysis of the model the model predictions results for the 100 sets have been plotted against the experimental data in fig 12 the average value has been plotted with a blue line and the red margin represents the standard deviation for the prediction of each point moreover the dates at which fumigation and cleaning has been performed on the plot are represented by vertical lines as shown in fig 12 the error in the prediction of the thrips incidence is small in the case of the campbell model at the points with intermediate and low incidence values and increases for high incidence values and the dates following shortly after fumigation 3 2 the ssi model in contrast to the campbell model there is a better reference for the initial values of the parameters in the case of the ssi linear model the minimum temperature is 11 c for species similar to the red rust thrips murai 2000 mcdonald et al 1999 ganaha kikumura and kijima 2016 yadav and chang 2014 the results in the distribution of the r 2 values for the training sets show a greater dispersion compared to those obtained for the campbell model the error bars in the estimation of the parameters fig 13 show similar results in magnitude for the parameters that represent causes of mortality for the parameters that make up the linear ssi function there is a higher standard deviation in the case of the minimum temperature fig 14 shows the influence of the growth rate components which exhibits a similar behaviour as in the case of the campbell model since both models are linear like in the previous case the effect of cleaning is zero the spraying has an effect of 60 in the first days after the application of the fumigation agent and reduces exponentially although its effect remains over a period of several weeks fig 15 shows that the prediction error for medium and low values of the thrips incidence is smaller compared to the higher incidence values furthermore for the days after the fumigation larger errors are observed as well the reason for this behaviour is that the hyperparameters making up the growth rate are quite sensitive and because an exponential function is utilised to model the population growth a small variation in these values can result in large changes in the peak values of the function 3 3 the logan model unlike the campbell and the ssi models which are both linear the standard deviation of the parameter values in the estimation of the nonlinear logan model fig 16 is much smaller this means that there is a greater stability in the model and the absolute minimum of the cost function does exist for this model the spraying with pest control agents for other species and the cleanliness of the plot have a considerable influence on the effective population growth rate fig 17 while the behaviour under normal conditions is quite similar to the campbell and ssi models the prediction error fig 18 follows the same trend as the previous models but the error in the peaks of the incidence of the thrips for the logan model is lower compared to the two linear models 3 4 model comparison fig 19 illustrates the behaviour of the population growth as a function of temperature for each of the models investigated in the previous section as can be seen the nonlinearity of the logan s model could be used to predict the behaviour of the growth of the population of thrips more accurately tables 4 and 5 shows the average results in terms of r2 and rmse for the training and test sets on which it can be concluded that the logan and campbell models perform better in training and testing it should be mentioned that the campbell model is simpler to implement which facilitates its use for decision making applications such as optimization or scheduling of pest control actions as can be seen in fig 19 the linear models can have negative growth values and have a higher positive slope compared to the nonlinear logan model this could explain why the error margins in the campbell and ssi models illustrated in figs 15 and 18 respectively are larger additionally the results for the best trained ensembles are shown parameters values are summarised in the appendix for a better understanding of the difference in the behaviour of the various models investigated when choosing the best model for each of the three cases considered fig 20 the alternatives that have the r 2 value table 6 in the training set greater than the mean and the r 2 value in the test set close to the mean are selected in this way overfitting is avoided and the model can accurately predict points for which it did not have information during training the rmse values for these models are summarised in table 7 from the results in fig 20 the benefits of using a hybrid modelling approach which combines first principles with data based approaches become clear making use of the physical understanding on the population growth and flexibly implementing appropriate mathematical relationships e g linear nonlinear for the growth rates significantly improve the accuracy of the model predictions over the whole year this removes the challenge encountered in the previous work done by manrique silupu et al 2021 where only machine learning techniques were studied of not being able to accurately predict the behaviour of the pests during the spring season all models achieve high r 2 values with differences within a 10th of percent figs 21 22 23 illustrate how the population growth rate varies with the temperature during the year the linear models campbell and ssi exhibit a similar behaviour and the graphs always coincide while for the logan model the growth rate differs during the summer months the effective growth rate for each model is shown in fig 24 it can be observed that the campbell and the ssi models show quite a similar behaviour while the logan model shows a significant influence of fumigation with agent 2 f2 which is the fumigation agent for other pests than the red rust thrips the parameter estimation task described previously was attempted with 500 sets generated with the gss algorithm but the results of the three model alternatives discussed above did not vary considerably versus the results where 100 sets were considered the validation results of the models obtained for a separate data set corresponding to measurements taken between april 2021 and july 2021 not used in any of the model development phases discussed above will provide more information on the accuracy of the model alternatives available and whether they can be used for forecasting applications from these data as shown in fig 25 the logan model predictions are closer to the experimental points which is confirmed by the r 2 and rmse values shown in table 8 4 conclusions and future work the paper presents the development of a decision making framework for the prediction of the incidence of pests in agricultural crops its application is illustrated on the red thrips of organic banana cultures more specifically on the development and selection of a mathematical model for assessing the incidence of the thrips based on weather and micro climate data in order to eliminate the disadvantages of previous work which focused only on machine learning techniques to assess the development of the insects a combined first principles and regression based machine learning approach is implemented firstly knowledge on the population growth of the pests is considered starting from model representations proposed in the literature for the bacterial growth modified to account for the particularities of the insects as well as climatic and operating conditions on an organic banana farm in the depiction of the behaviour of the thrips a new definition is used for the growth rate that takes into account not only the natural life cycle of the pests but the influence of pest management actions such as the fumigation or cleaning of the banana plot as well furthermore models based on previous work campbell ssi and logan are used to define the natural growth rate of the insects secondly once this representation based on the physical understanding of the system is available regression based approaches are implemented for estimating the various model parameters using the experimental data available the application of the framework for the incidence of red thrips in organic banana crops shows improved accuracy of the resulting models versus previous work exclusively focused on machine learning approaches further demonstrating the benefit of including the knowledge and physical understanding of the insect behaviour in the mathematical representation of the system on the type of first principles models to be used the results show that the implementation of models with a linear relationship based on temperature campbell and ssi although able to provide a physical meaning for the considered variables and offer sufficient understanding of the abiotic components and spread of the pests do not correctly describe the pest behaviour across the whole temperature range however linear models can prove able to provide sufficiently accurate solutions in a reasonable amount of time for cases when a large number of iterative computations of the pest incidence are required for the current version of the model developed using data from the region of piura in peru the inclusion of other atmospheric variables e g wind speed rain fall etc was not considered due to the limited amount of data available e g only one data point with precipitation available for the period considered in the analysis nonetheless for other regions with organic banana crops the inclusion of these variables in the assessment is needed to improve the predictive accuracy of the tools the selected models can be further used in the development of tools for pest management which can enable the estimation of the increase of the thrips population in a banana crop with a small margin of error this would imply a reduction in plot inspection costs and would be much easier to implement compared to current techniques based on image processing this work is a starting point towards the development of new methodologies and decision making tools for boosting the artisanal agricultural industry which can provide a high quality product but cannot compete with highly industrialized processes since a greater amount of information will be obtained from the data acquisition system and the digitized pest registration system using the framework described here the decision making tools can be easily extended to the behaviour of other pests e g black sigatoka mycoshpaerella fijiensis west indian weevil metamasius hemipterus banana weevil cosmopolites sordidus etc that impact the organic banana production and for which data is already available in the database furthermore the approach is sufficiently generic to be applied for organic banana crops located in other regions of the world the proposed tools are implemented with the intention of improving the quality of production of the organic banana farmers in the region of piura and to facilitate monitoring and data collection allowing new projects to be initiated starting with the models developed in this contribution the optimum scheduling of fumigation and cleaning actions can be implemented to minimize the use of chemicals reduce the cost and increase the profit margin without affecting the quality of the final product as the current data acquisition system has information on the humidity of the soil modules for the monitoring control and scheduling of irrigation actions on the organic banana farm can be easily implemented and used further developments will include tools for the monitoring and scheduling of fertilizing actions as well however in this case besides the need for model representations of such processes additional sensing devices for the concentration of components such as c n p in the soil need to be installed in the data acquisition system credit authorship contribution statement jean c campos methodology software

24351,the study of community based conservation is challenged by a large number of important variables and nonlinear dynamics this complexity has made quantitative and comparative analyses notoriously difficult here we argue that analyzing the emergence and persistence of community based conservation institutions as an emergent phenomenon of individual decision making can yield important quantitative insights we first review diffusion of innovations theory doi and the broader field of cultural evolution we then simulate data on community adoption of a conservation institution contingent on feedbacks between individual behavior and environmental processes we demonstrate that fitting these data to differential models of disease transmission on which doi is founded can produce reliable estimates of the rates of adoption dropout and long term uptake of an institution overall we explore a new quantitative approach for modeling the spread of conservation behaviors using probabilistic differential equations and argue for further incorporation of cultural evolutionary theory into the field keywords community based conservation diffusion of innovations cultural

diffusion study is something like the use of radioactive tracers in studying the process of plant growth it helps illuminate the process everett m rogers diffusion of innovations 2010 1 1 motivation it is becoming increasingly apparent that humanity will not reach global conservation targets through top down policies alone dudley et al 2018 mair et al 2021 tittensor et al 2014 brockington 2002 conservationists are thus turning to local communities to self impose and maintain sustainable resource extraction limits and restore degraded natural areas amel et al 2017 catalano et al 2019 community based conservation projects aim to incentivize these behaviors in rural and often very poor communities with little to no external oversight western and wright 1994 while the details of each intervention vary considerably the general strategy is to closely link community development and conservation goals to promote robust behavioral changes in resource dependent communities brooks et al 2013 horwich and lyon 2007 while some debate still exists it is largely accepted that empowering communities to self run conservation institutions is a viable method for seeding self sustaining and ethical protections on natural resources turner et al 2007 berkes 2007 adams et al 2004 agrawal and gibson 1999 yates et al 2019 broadly defined institutions like those introduced by community based conservation interventions are socially constructed and transmitted prescriptions on behavior that often aim to incentivize collective action lott 1992 currie et al 2016 richerson and henrich 2009 in natural resource management the desired outcome of any particular institution varies on a case by case basis but may include goals like increasing the livelihood benefits produced from a resource or improving the biodiversity of a particular area agrawal 2014 regardless of the exact social or ecological outcome of interest success of a conservation institution has become synonymous with the degree to which a population adopts the particular behavioral prescription and whether or not that behavior is sustained over time agrawal 2001 yates et al 2019 decades of research have identified key contextual factors that support the durability of resource safeguarding behaviors in populations particularly with regard to common pool resources agrawal 2001 baland and platteau 1996 ostrom 1990 these factors are largely narrative descriptions of the qualities of and interactions between resource types governance structures and resource users that are most likely to lead to stable and sustainable resource management institutions ostrom 2009 scholars have identified at least 40 unique factors as contributing to the success of community based conservation institutions and some overarching patterns have begun to emerge ostrom 1990 2009 agrawal 2001 continual monitoring graduated sanctions for offenses and well defined social boundaries particularly stand out as important themes cox et al 2010 baggio et al 2016 research on common property additionally recommends that institutions be matched in scale to the underlying ecological processes of the resources they aim to manage mckean 2000 many of the factors that support the long term viability of conservation institutions are intertwined such that the applicability of one may depend on the level of another and some factors may be inextricably correlated agrawal and goyal 2001 agrawal 2003 predictors and outcomes of interest commonly exhibit threshold effects time lags feedbacks and a variety of other nonlinear dynamics making causal inference through standard regression practices difficult folke 2007 levin et al 2013 and further which individual factors are most important is highly specific to a given community or location suggesting that there is not possibly one unifying panacea for common pool resource management issues brooks et al 2012 geist and lambin 2002 agrawal and gibson 2001 this complexity of community based resource management systems and logistical constraints in measuring the sheer number of important variables has made multi site comparative analyses elusive sesmad 2014 biggs et al 2021 thus even with decades of productive research on sustainable resource management all major syntheses remain descriptive in nature lacking a robust methodology to quantify causal insights cumming et al 2020 frey 2017 mcginnis and ostrom 2014 gutiérrez et al 2011 we argue here that considering the stability of institutions within a population from the perspective of individuals rather than entire communities may provide valuable insight for implementing community based conservation projects both qualitatively and quantitatively sustainable resource management institutions are observed at the community level but in reality they are an emergent property of individual level decision making communities do not adopt behaviors individuals do currie et al 2021 the normative conditions imposed on individuals by their ecological and social environments i e the factors referenced above affect the likelihood that they will endogenously engage in cooperative resource management practices or adopt them when exogenously introduced by an intervention wilson et al 2013 andrews and borgerhoff mulder 2018 a major question in implementing these projects is if members of a population will indeed adopt a specific intervention and if so how quickly radeloff et al 2013 predicting the final proportion of a population that will adopt an intervention is critical as many interventions require buy in from nearly all community members to be effective mangubhai et al 2011 visconti et al 2019 by examining sustainable resource management institutions as the emergent outcome of individual behavioral changes we can leverage insights from other areas of social science to further guide theory on why some institutions emerge and persist and others fail to be adopted long term berkes 2004 in this article we examine one social science theory specifically focused on individual behavior adoption diffusion of innovations doi and its previous and potential applications to community based conservation institutions rogers 2010 mascia and mills 2018 our primary aim is to give a practical demonstration of how insights from doi can be applied to expand our inference about the spread and persistence of conservation interventions beyond narrative descriptions we do this by first simulating data on conservation adoption in a resource dependent population and then statistically fitting a model of diffusion to these data adopting resource safeguarding behaviors fundamentally differs from adopting more standard behaviors such as clothing choice by design conservation behaviors alter the natural environment and adjust the arena in which individuals make future choices such as to maintain the behavior our simulation highlights this feedback of interest to answer the key question of whether doi is specifically applicable to community based conservation given this unique adoption dynamic throughout this article we situate doi theory in the broader literature on cultural evolution and argue that this body of work may provide more actionable insight than doi in isolation particularly by considering underlying mechanisms of behavioral transmission 1 2 diffusion of innovations promoting the widespread adoption of some novel to the individual behavior is not an issue unique to community based conservation producers of cigarettes and snack foods as well as public health professionals have been grappling with these questions for decades doi recognizes that this process is primarily governed by the level of uncertainty an individual has about the utility of the novel behavior and their personal threshold for the amount of certainty required to make a decision rogers 2010 when an individual is introduced to a new behavior they often have a high degree of uncertainty about the risks and benefits of adopting and will wait to adopt until that uncertainty is reduced to a tolerable level the primary way individuals reduce uncertainty about the outcome of adopting a particular behavior is through second hand observation of early adopters therefore at the core of doi is the observation that individuals imitate those around them when making decisions about adopting a novel behavior rather than weighing the pros and cons independently rogers 2010 henrich et al 2001 when modifying their beliefs or behaviors people do not imitate other individuals at random bandura and walters 1977 instead they preferentially adopt traits by employing a variety of learning biases such as success biased learning where individuals who are perceived as more successful are disproportionately likely to be copied boyd and richerson 1988a laland 2004 as a result the cumulative culture of a population evolves over time as various beliefs and behaviors are preferentially copied and their frequency within a population changes while a full review of cultural evolution is beyond the scope of this paper the general intuition is that populations carry a variable pool of information that is shaped by events in the lives of individuals such as social observation or natural selection mesoudi 2016 this information affects individuals behaviors that in turn may affect their environments and feedback to further alter which traits are adopted in the future durham 1991 henrich and mcelreath 2003 observed variation among groups such as differences in resource management institutions are produced by such social and environmental histories then reinforced through conformist biased learning where the dominant behavioral trait is disproportionately copied henrich and boyd 1998 thus cultural evolution provides an intuitive way to integrate individual decision making population level patterns and even population level behavior environment feedbacks diffusion of novel beliefs and behaviors is a specific instance of cultural evolution where the trait being transmitted is new to the population and outcompetes some previous cultural variant such as in the classic example of hybrid corn seed adoption in iowa farmers mesoudi 2016 ryan and gross 1950 we observe these patterns using diffusion curves that show the proportion of a population that has adopted a belief or behavior on the y axis as a function of time on the x axis hoppitt et al 2010 rogers 2010 ryan and gross 1950 the exact shape of these diffusion curves can be highly dependent on the learning mechanism employed by individuals in the population as well as contextual factors like the population density or ease of trialing the cultural variant smaldino et al 2017 henrich 2001 rogers 2010 in the vast majority of empirical studies the diffusion of a novel trait produces a sigmoidal s shape where it initially spreads slowly followed by a period of rapid adoption then again spreads slowly until it reaches an equilibrium rogers 2010 this s shaped curve is indicative of biased social learning in contrast to the relatively rare r shaped curves observed when individuals learn through independent trial and error fig 1 henrich 2001 the curvilinear r shape produced by individual or environmental learning is a result of the fact that late adopters represent the tail of the distribution having not discovered and thus adopted the novel behavior even after many trials henrich 2001 these two curve shapes however are not completely distinct as the proportion of learning strategies employed by individuals in a population shifts more toward individual or social learning we expect to see a shift toward an r shape or s shape respectively henrich 2001 1 3 diffusion of innovations in community based conservation just as the sigmoidal pattern indicative of social learning is seen in the majority of cases on behavioral adoption broadly scholars have also noticed this pattern in over 80 of case studies on the uptake of community based conservation interventions worldwide mascia and mills 2018 mills et al 2019 fittingly high level studies have begun identifying doi as potentially useful for diagnosing why some community based conservation interventions spread and persist while others fizzle out for example in a review of 22 conservation interventions referenced above the majority of initiatives were adopted by less than 30 of potential adopters at the sigmoidal equilibrium the authors use insights from doi to suggest that practitioners may actively spread information on interventions as in abernethy et al 2014 or facilitate communication to increase adoption rates mills et al 2019 greenhalgh et al 2004 further a recent framework for understanding the establishment persistence and spread of community based conservation practices identifies qualitative insights such as intervention observability from doi as useful in guiding the development of conservation interventions mahajan et al 2020 as these high level studies suggest qualitative insights from doi have been productively applied to understand the rate and success of spread of conservation behaviors in single case studies around the world in kenya for example mbaru and barnes 2017 showed that identifying socially well connected individuals can facilitate the rapid diffusion of information on conservation objectives similarly in fort collins co researchers demonstrated that both the speed and extent of diffusion of information on native plant gardening likely increase when community members are offered incentives to increase communication niemiec et al 2021 romero de diego et al 2021 used expert interviews to identify that observability of benefits was a key driver of the rapid adoption of a voluntary wildlife management program among landholders in mexico conversely in contexts where observability and thus imitation are limited such as across neighboring islands the rate and degree of spread of community based conservation interventions is considerably attenuated pietri et al 2009 this finding mirrors those of studies which look at more general cultural adoption between islands further suggesting that conservation behaviors may spread similarly to technological or ideological innovations kline and boyd 2010 beheim and bell 2011 these studies are compelling in their conclusion that doi can be productively applied to the spread of community based conservation but have been critiqued as general narrative suggestions from doi that may miss important contextual factors unique to each intervention steenbergen et al 2021 lam et al 2020 lund and bluwstein 2018 below we make a quantitative argument for using doi to understand the spread of community based conservation interventions we envision a practitioner who is monitoring the weekly monthly or even yearly uptake rates of an intervention and is hoping to predict if and when it will take off in the population what the final proportion of adopters will be and what they can do to promote its spread in this review we therefore explicitly demonstrate how doi can be used to generate predictions about the patterns of uptake of conservation behaviors given behavior environment feedbacks and diagnose how an intervention may be best improved 1 4 quantitative applications in this section we explain how we can fit an observed pattern of diffusion mathematically to estimate rates of adoption and dropout as well as to predict the speed and degree to which a population will adopt an intervention the s shaped diffusion pattern of behavioral spread over time mirrors that of community disease transmission smaldino and jones 2020 this parallel implies that the well established mathematics used to describe disease transmission patterns can be applied to fitting models of behavioral spread cavalli sforza and feldman 1981 strang 1991 specifically the canonical susceptible infectious recovered sir model and sirs variation where individuals are added back to the pool of susceptibles after recovery eq 1 have been demonstrated to be well suited to fitting the diffusion process famil rohani et al 2019 smaldino and jones 2020 these compartmental differential equations assign every member of a population to a category s i or r depending on the proportion of individuals in the other categories and parameter values for the natural history characteristics of a given disease tolles and luong 2020 in this instantiation the natural history parameter β represents the rate of infection in the population γ represents the rate of recovery and χ is the rate that recovered individuals are added back into the pool of susceptibles 1 d s d t β s t i t χ r t d i d t β s t i t γ i t d r d t γ i t χ r t when the natural history characteristics of some pathogen are known the si sir sis sirs suite of models reliably give accurate deterministic predictions about the number of individuals in a population who will become infected and for how long a disease will persist within a population huppert and katriel 2013 for a specific conservation interventions however there is no way to precisely know the natural history features such as the rate or duration of adoption ahead of time instead the qualitative insights from doi and the study of sustainable resource management institutions referenced above aim to increase the rate of spread and reduce the rate of dropout so that the intervention persists in the population and may even spread to new communities while we can not know exactly what the rates of spread and dropout will be ahead of time we can use bayesian inference to probabilistically estimate them once the project has been implemented margossian 2019 margossian and gillespie 2017 carpenter 2018 knowing these parameters may allow us to predict the final rate of uptake from early in the project identify whether adoption or dropout are limiting the overall rate of uptake and apply the qualitative insights from doi and natural resource management institutions in a more targeted fashion the uptake of community based conservation is subject to behavior environment feedbacks a fundamental difference from behavioral adoption generally liu et al 2007 in the case of marine protected areas for example success in conserving fish populations may actually disincentivize individuals to continue supporting conservation programs christie 2004 a key question then is whether the diffusion models explained above will still reliably fit the spread of conservation behaviors when those behaviors alter the environment and changes in the environment alter the payoff structure of various behavioral choices to answer this question we use an agent based simulation to generate data on the spread of a conservation behavior via social learning contingent on feedbacks with the environment then using the five run average of just the first 30 of the data we probabilistically estimate the average rates of intervention spread dropout readoption using a bayesian instantiation of the sirs model shown in eq 1 we use these estimated parameters to predict the long term average adoption pattern for the remaining 70 of time steps and compare our predicted values to those observed in the simulations while the purpose of this example is to test whether the sirs model can capture our core dynamics of interest it also explicitly demonstrates how a practitioner or other researchers can directly apply the quantitative process described above we first briefly describe the simulation below 2 modeling 2 1 agent based simulation we seek to test whether the sirs model shown in eq 1 can produce reliable insights about community uptake of a conservation behavior especially given behavior environment feedbacks common in natural resource management institutions to answer this question we first need complete time series data in hand that are a product of our dynamics of interest to obtain these data we develop a minimal agent based model that we use to simulate data on the spread of a resource safeguarding behavior within a population müller et al 2013 smajgl et al 2011 in order to assess the impact of feedbacks between behavior and the environment we simulate data using two different social learning strategies only one of which involves a behavior environment feedback le et al 2012 kendal et al 2018 the first is random copying where agents are paired with another agent at random and have a 25 chance of adopting the strategy of the agent they are paired with independent of the harvest benefit provided by adopting the behavior or not mcelreath et al 2008 barrett 2019 this strategy does not involve a direct feedback between behavior and the environment we include it as a baseline to compare against our second strategy which does the second mechanism is success biased learning under which agents disproportionately copy the behaviors of other agents with the greatest harvesting success baldini 2013 this mechanism is formally demonstrated in eq 2 for two behaviors a b where the probability that an individual adopts behavior a is a function of the mean harvest p from each behavior at each time step and the strength of the bias β barrett 2019 under biased social learning the strength of the learning biases e g β control how disproportionately agents copy others based on a given condition e g success a β 1 in this formulation would thus mean that the probability that one agent copies another is directly proportional to the ratio of their harvests behavioral change given success biased learning is therefore dependent on feedbacks with the environment as harvest success results from agent behaviors in previous time steps 2 pr a a b t 1 exp β p a t exp β p a t exp β p b t our simulated system is conceptualized as a fishery where agents are directly compensated for forgoing resource extraction from a particular area if they choose rakotonarivo et al 2021 we establish a fishery loosely based on a global average stock integrity at 20 of its potential carrying capacity fao 2020 in the first time step we introduce an intervention that delineates 20 of the fishery as a conservation area and just 2 of agents initially change their behavior to forgo harvesting there fish reproduce proportionally to the population in each time period and move freely between the conservation area and unconserved area in each subsequent time step agents who adopted the resource safeguarding behavior enrolled receive a reward and continue to harvest just from the remaining 80 of the unconserved fishery agents not enrolled in the intervention harvest from the entire fishery and forgo the reward after each harvest period agents are randomly paired and employ either random copying or success biased learning to decide whether or not to adopt the behavior of their partner in the next time step baldini 2012 the conserved and unconserved resource pools are reduced according to agents harvesting behavior regenerate and move from one area to the other if the carrying capacity is reached in any respective area a visual description of this minimal model is shown in fig 2 and the full overview design concepts and details protocol can be found in the supplemental material s1 grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2020 we use this model to simulate data on the adoption and persistence of a conservation institution given two different learning mechanisms random copying and success biased imitation aside from the learning mechanism employed by the population all model conditions are identical for these two scenarios random copying is used as a reference as it reliably produces the standard sigmoidal s curve of behavioral adoption and does not incorporate any feedbacks between adoption and the environment under the success biased learning scenario agents compare their harvests to others in each time step and disproportionately copy more successful agents in this instantiation then adoption is dependent on harvest success and harvest success is determined largely by the amount of available resources in each area as the amount of available resources in an area is determined by the number of agents who harvest there this learning mechanism incorporates behavior environment feedbacks typical of natural resource management institutions having independently sampled from one or both environments agents then compare their harvests to those of others in each time step in this way the success biased learning scenario actually represents a mix of individual and social learning rather than a scenario where individuals make decisions purely from social information the adoption pattern observed in this simulation results in a mix between an r and s type curve reinforcing the interpretation of this scenario as a mix of individual and social learning henrich 2001 fig 3 shows the full output for five runs of the later simulation where adoption enrollment spikes initially but drops off dramatically as the resources in the unconserved area are reduced following increased harvest pressure there as a result of the conservation intervention this exact dynamic is however highly flexible given the specific parameter combinations as described in section 2 3 2 2 fitting data with probabilistic differential equations with data on adoption of conservation behavior for both learning mechanisms in hand we fit the sirs model described in eq 1 to the first 30 of observations averaged across five model runs we use multiple model runs to avoid spurious results stemming from model stochasticity alone five model runs are used as opposed to 100 or 1000 as this leaves some residual stochasticity in the adoption data that is more representative of what might be realistically observed duplicate analyses to those presented below but instead run on the average of 100 simulation runs can be found in the supplemental material s2 given these data we use probabilistic sampling to infer the parameters β γ and χ for the full bayesian eq 3 below where y t represents the total number of individuals who are enrolled in the community based intervention at any given time here infected individuals are those that are enrolled in the conservation intervention 3 y t b i n o m i a l n i t d s d t β s t i t χ r t d i d t β s t i t γ i t dr dt γ i t χ r t β γ χ n o r m a l 0 0 5 for both learning mechanisms the sirs model exhibited markon chain convergence fig 4 and resulted in an r of 1 for all estimated parameters as the parameters β γ and χ are directly interpretable as the rates of adoption dropout and willingness to retry a previously abandoned intervention accurate estimation of these values especially in the early stages of an intervention provides practical and straightforward intuition to diagnose areas for improvement in community based conservation interventions for example a practitioner might fit this model to real world participation rates during the early weeks of an intervention in order to estimate the rates of adoption and dropout if both rates are low the practitioner should focus on increasing initial adoption conversely if both rates are high they should instead focus efforts on retention of enrolled participants in addition these insights may help practitioners better decide which factors from the institutional design literature may be most impactful for their specific system this might take the form of increasing communication and observability of benefits to boost initial adoption or investing in conflict resolution mechanisms to reduce dropout we can also use these parameter values estimated from the first 30 of the time series to predict the long term patterns of adoption for a community based conservation initiative in figs 5 6 the translucent black lines show 1000 draws from the posterior predicting the proportion of the population who will be enrolled in the intervention at every time step averaged across the five model runs gray and blue points show the initial 30 of the data that was used to estimate the three parameters of interest and the remaining 70 of data respectively these figures show that the sirs model accurately captures and predicts the pattern of behavioral adoption for both random copying and environmentally mediated success biased learning further the mean absolute error mae between the simulated test data later 70 and the median model predictions for those data are 2 98 and 4 52 of the population for the random copying and success biased learning scenarios respectively indicating good model fit figs 5 and 6 also demonstrate that different scenarios and respective learning mechanisms while both producing a stable adoption rate can result in different overall rates in adoption of an intervention even under identical starting conditions in the simulation of a population employing random copying the population equilibrates at nearly 90 adoption of the intervention behavior for success biased learning on the other hand resource scarcity in the unconserved area caused the population to adopt the intervention at approximately 60 in the long term lastly the mix of social and independent learning employed by agents in the success biased learning scenario produces a somewhat r shaped curve as explained in the section above these results show that the sirs model of diffusion can reliably fit the pattern of behavioral adoption even when the pattern does not follow a strict sigmoidal s shape 2 3 example limitations parallel to the examples above we can use our agent based simulation to explore parameter combinations that expose limitations for the application of the sirs diffusion model for capturing and predicting conservation adoption dynamics under behavior environment feedbacks specifically as the parameters in the sirs model only directly account for social processes adoption dynamics resulting from abrupt environmental change are not well predicted for example in fig 7 we consider a resource pool that is relatively intact at the start of the simulation 80 of carrying capacity paired with an unsustainable harvest rate in this simulation all agents initially rapidly enroll in the conservation intervention as there is no cost to doing so resources in the unconserved area are plentiful however when the resource pool in the unconserved area is depleted agents quickly drop out of the conservation institution in favor of harvesting from the conservation area fig 8 shows the result of fitting these data with the sirs diffusion model described above the mae of this model is 43 07 indicating poor model fit to ensure that our modeling approach is generally robust against these types of ecologically driven dynamics we again ran five iterations of the agent based model and assessed sirs model fit for a wide range of parameter combinations as shown in fig 9 and in our supplemental materials s3 our approach yields reliable model fit as assessed through mae across the spectrum of realistic parameter values it is worth noting however that the sirs model fails to capture trends in conservation adoption in boundary cases such as when 80 90 of resources are designated for conservation fig 9 this indicates that the method presented in this paper may not be appropriate for real world application where adoption dynamics are expected to be heavily driven by ecological change rather than social dynamics 3 discussion 3 1 shortcomings of diffusion of innovations in community based conservation as demonstrated in figs 5 6 the standard sirs diffusion model can reliably capture the long term patterns of behavioral adoption for community based conservation interventions even when adoption is contingent on feedbacks with ecological processes fitting this model to observed data on the uptake of a behavior can provide us with estimates of the rates of adoption dropout and willingness to retry a specific intervention and allow us to predict the final stable rate of adoption in the population from early in the project these insights while useful are somewhat limited in their ability to prescribe improvements for an intervention as highlighted by the quote in the beginning of this article diffusion study can explain what is happening in a system but gives little intuition as to the mechanisms behind why it is happening rogers 2010 as first described by henrich 2001 and demonstrated in figs 5 6 we see clear changes in the population patterns of adoption when individuals employ differing levels of social or independent learning but when comparing many biased social learning mechanisms the pattern of adoption may exhibit equifinality where many different underlying mechanisms may produce similar or even identical patterns over time barrett 2019 critically this makes it virtually impossible to infer the specific biased social learning mechanism s used by a population from the pattern of adoption over time alone this information is however important for researchers and practitioners as the social transmission mechanism or mix of mechanisms employed by a population can dramatically affect the overall rates of adoption for a given behavior smaldino et al 2017 andrews and borgerhoff mulder 2018 tam et al 2021 plainly doi can tell us if an intervention is being robustly adopted or not but we need to understand the actual transmission mechanism to effectively act on this information thankfully this information is possible to collect for example tam et al 2021 and kline et al 2018 give practical examples of how to measure social learning strategies in the context of conservation and tools game survey instrument code etc with which to collect and analyze the data with information on the patterns and mechanisms of uptake of community based conservation behaviors we can more selectively apply the many narrative insights from doi and the study of natural resource management institutions in populations primarily employing prestige biased learning where prestigious individuals are disproportionately copied for instance the identification of and collaboration with community change agents may be particularly effective jiménez and mesoudi 2019 henrich and gil white 2001 dietz et al 2002 conversely the observability of both resources and the benefits of conservation are likely of increased importance when the population primarily employs content biased learning where some characteristic of the trait itself makes it more desirable than a previous trait ostrom 1990 rogers 2010 boyd and richerson 1988b 3 2 future work understanding the causal mechanisms behind the patterns of behavioral transmission is necessary to better delineate and predict how conservation will affect both people and the environment cheng et al 2020 researchers increasingly recognize that models of human caused environmental change must explicitly incorporate dynamic social processes based on realistic human cognitions that allow actors to modify their behaviors in response to new information meyfroidt 2013 turner et al 2021 polain de waroux et al 2021 behavioral adoption is not truly binary as implied by doi rather individuals modify behaviors they adopt in response to their personal experiences and needs enquist et al 2011 research on cultural evolution has accordingly begun to incorporate these cognitive processes into formal models gabora and steel 2017 2020 hence modeling human behavior in the context of community based conservation is in its infancy going forward it will require a complex dynamic systems approach in which behaviors and the biophysical environment coevolve schill et al 2019 mechanistic or process models allow for us to formally describe these complex interactions while testing the logical consequences of our assumptions and the relation of our hypothesized processes to observed data epstein 2008 the practice of applying statistical frameworks for parameter estimation to analytical process models particularly ordinary differential equations is still relatively new and has been embraced mostly in ecology hefley et al 2017 laubmeier et al 2020 morales and morán lópez 2021 this emerging methodology allows for estimating interesting and directly interpretable process parameters which is not possible with linear regression we believe this is an exciting new avenue for conservation science as the direct interpretability and applicability of process parameters lend themselves well to tight integration with applied research as is common in the field future research could extend the sirs diffusion model to include an exposure term i e seirs to allow for individual variation in the exposure to an intervention required before adoption possibly dependent on individual characteristics an additional line of research aimed at better capturing the trends shown in figs 7 8 might include a term that represents change in the environment over time and the effect of resource levels on adoption rates to more accurately reflect the social ecological coupling as exemplified in figs 7 through 9 any model that predicts human behavior due to past behavioral dynamics will fail to capture trends driven primarily by environmental conditions an example of such an extension is presented below where we include another equation for the change in a resource pool over time d e d t we also must include three additional parameters ϕ ρ and θ which represent the effect of resource level on enrollment infection the effect of harvest on the resource level and the regeneration rate of the resource respectively 4 d s d t β s t i t χ r t d i d t β s t i t γ i t ϕ e t d r d t γ i t χ r t ϕ e t d e d t ρ s t r t θ e t while process models may be preferable to simulation and linear regression approaches for predicting adoption outcomes of conservation interventions they might not always be possible in complex systems these models can quickly require many parameters in order to account for all moving parts accurately and thus are prone to issues of identifiability in parameter estimation and may even become mathematically intractable laubmeier et al 2020 further as has been demonstrated in coastal fisheries these systems can exhibit mathematical chaos where our inability to measure the parameters of interest at a fine enough resolution results in seemingly stochastic unpredictable outcomes wilson et al 1994 coupled human and natural systems commonly exhibit dynamics with thresholds time lags and heterogeneity not present in social or natural systems in isolation and therefore are difficult to model analytically liu et al 2007 in very complex cases such as these we argue that agent based simulations are the preferred approach as they allow for these features of complex systems that are difficult or even impossible to account for with analytical process models such the sirs or sirs extension model presented in eq 4 reyers et al 2018 railsback and grimm 2012 wilensky and rand 2015 agent based simulations allow modelers to impose a realism in the governance or institutional dynamics that are largely intractable in closed form mathematical equations et al 2020 bravo 2011 joffre et al 2015 further agent based simulations uniquely allow researchers to hypothesize and test causal processes in complex social ecological systems baggio and hillis 2018 schlüter et al 2019 as the number of purely subsistence communities shrinks each year worldwide and multiple levels of institutions are increasingly involved in natural resource management incorporating these features into our models is paramount for reliable inference mckean 2000 armitage et al 2009 4 conclusions overall we argue that fitting process models of behavioral diffusion to data on the spread of conservation behaviors is a practical way for researchers and practitioners to apply doi to community based conservation we test the utility of the sirs diffusion model on simulated data that highlight the feedback between behavioral adoption and environmental change commonly seen in community based conservation interventions we show that this model can be a powerful tool for estimating the natural history characteristics of a particular intervention such as the rate of spread and for predicting the long term patterns of adoption even under reciprocal behavior environment interactions we also introduce the broader field of cultural evolution as a more comprehensive body of theory for understanding the underlying mechanisms of behavioral adoption than doi alone we hope that this review provides a model for how practitioners might practically apply insights from doi to community based conservation interventions while also

24351,the study of community based conservation is challenged by a large number of important variables and nonlinear dynamics this complexity has made quantitative and comparative analyses notoriously difficult here we argue that analyzing the emergence and persistence of community based conservation institutions as an emergent phenomenon of individual decision making can yield important quantitative insights we first review diffusion of innovations theory doi and the broader field of cultural evolution we then simulate data on community adoption of a conservation institution contingent on feedbacks between individual behavior and environmental processes we demonstrate that fitting these data to differential models of disease transmission on which doi is founded can produce reliable estimates of the rates of adoption dropout and long term uptake of an institution overall we explore a new quantitative approach for modeling the spread of conservation behaviors

diffusion study is something like the use of radioactive tracers in studying the process of plant growth it helps illuminate the process everett m rogers diffusion of innovations 2010 1 1 motivation it is becoming increasingly apparent that humanity will not reach global conservation targets through top down policies alone dudley et al 2018 mair et al 2021 tittensor et al 2014 brockington 2002 conservationists are thus turning to local communities to self impose and maintain sustainable resource extraction limits and restore degraded natural areas amel et al 2017 catalano et al 2019 community based conservation projects aim to incentivize these behaviors in rural and often very poor communities with little to no external oversight western and wright 1994 while the details of each intervention vary considerably the general strategy is to closely link community development and conservation goals to promote robust behavioral changes in resource dependent communities brooks et al 2013 horwich and lyon 2007 while some debate still exists it is largely accepted that empowering communities to self run conservation institutions is a viable method for seeding self sustaining and ethical protections on natural resources turner et al 2007 berkes 2007 adams et al 2004 agrawal and gibson 1999 yates et al 2019 broadly defined institutions like those introduced by community based conservation interventions are socially constructed and transmitted prescriptions on behavior that often aim to incentivize collective action lott 1992 currie et al 2016 richerson and henrich 2009 in natural resource management the desired outcome of any particular institution varies on a case by case basis but may include goals like increasing the livelihood benefits produced from a resource or improving the biodiversity of a particular area agrawal 2014 regardless of the exact social or ecological outcome of interest success of a conservation institution has become synonymous with the degree to which a population adopts the particular behavioral prescription and whether or not that behavior is sustained over time agrawal 2001 yates et al 2019 decades of research have identified key contextual factors that support the durability of resource safeguarding behaviors in populations particularly with regard to common pool resources agrawal 2001 baland and platteau 1996 ostrom 1990 these factors are largely narrative descriptions of the qualities of and interactions between resource types governance structures and resource users that are most likely to lead to stable and sustainable resource management institutions ostrom 2009 scholars have identified at least 40 unique factors as contributing to the success of community based conservation institutions and some overarching patterns have begun to emerge ostrom 1990 2009 agrawal 2001 continual monitoring graduated sanctions for offenses and well defined social boundaries particularly stand out as important themes cox et al 2010 baggio et al 2016 research on common property additionally recommends that institutions be matched in scale to the underlying ecological processes of the resources they aim to manage mckean 2000 many of the factors that support the long term viability of conservation institutions are intertwined such that the applicability of one may depend on the level of another and some factors may be inextricably correlated agrawal and goyal 2001 agrawal 2003 predictors and outcomes of interest commonly exhibit threshold effects time lags feedbacks and a variety of other nonlinear dynamics making causal inference through standard regression practices difficult folke 2007 levin et al 2013 and further which individual factors are most important is highly specific to a given community or location suggesting that there is not possibly one unifying panacea for common pool resource management issues brooks et al 2012 geist and lambin 2002 agrawal and gibson 2001 this complexity of community based resource management systems and logistical constraints in measuring the sheer number of important variables has made multi site comparative analyses elusive sesmad 2014 biggs et al 2021 thus even with decades of productive research on sustainable resource management all major syntheses remain descriptive in nature lacking a robust methodology to quantify causal insights cumming et al 2020 frey 2017 mcginnis and ostrom 2014 gutiérrez et al 2011 we argue here that considering the stability of institutions within a population from the perspective of individuals rather than entire communities may provide valuable insight for implementing community based conservation projects both qualitatively and quantitatively sustainable resource management institutions are observed at the community level but in reality they are an emergent property of individual level decision making communities do not adopt behaviors individuals do currie et al 2021 the normative conditions imposed on individuals by their ecological and social environments i e the factors referenced above affect the likelihood that they will endogenously engage in cooperative resource management practices or adopt them when exogenously introduced by an intervention wilson et al 2013 andrews and borgerhoff mulder 2018 a major question in implementing these projects is if members of a population will indeed adopt a specific intervention and if so how quickly radeloff et al 2013 predicting the final proportion of a population that will adopt an intervention is critical as many interventions require buy in from nearly all community members to be effective mangubhai et al 2011 visconti et al 2019 by examining sustainable resource management institutions as the emergent outcome of individual behavioral changes we can leverage insights from other areas of social science to further guide theory on why some institutions emerge and persist and others fail to be adopted long term berkes 2004 in this article we examine one social science theory specifically focused on individual behavior adoption diffusion of innovations doi and its previous and potential applications to community based conservation institutions rogers 2010 mascia and mills 2018 our primary aim is to give a practical demonstration of how insights from doi can be applied to expand our inference about the spread and persistence of conservation interventions beyond narrative descriptions we do this by first simulating data on conservation adoption in a resource dependent population and then statistically fitting a model of diffusion to these data adopting resource safeguarding behaviors fundamentally differs from adopting more standard behaviors such as clothing choice by design conservation behaviors alter the natural environment and adjust the arena in which individuals make future choices such as to maintain the behavior our simulation highlights this feedback of interest to answer the key question of whether doi is specifically applicable to community based conservation given this unique adoption dynamic throughout this article we situate doi theory in the broader literature on cultural evolution and argue that this body of work may provide more actionable insight than doi in isolation particularly by considering underlying mechanisms of behavioral transmission 1 2 diffusion of innovations promoting the widespread adoption of some novel to the individual behavior is not an issue unique to community based conservation producers of cigarettes and snack foods as well as public health professionals have been grappling with these questions for decades doi recognizes that this process is primarily governed by the level of uncertainty an individual has about the utility of the novel behavior and their personal threshold for the amount of certainty required to make a decision rogers 2010 when an individual is introduced to a new behavior they often have a high degree of uncertainty about the risks and benefits of adopting and will wait to adopt until that uncertainty is reduced to a tolerable level the primary way individuals reduce uncertainty about the outcome of adopting a particular behavior is through second hand observation of early adopters therefore at the core of doi is the observation that individuals imitate those around them when making decisions about adopting a novel behavior rather than weighing the pros and cons independently rogers 2010 henrich et al 2001 when modifying their beliefs or behaviors people do not imitate other individuals at random bandura and walters 1977 instead they preferentially adopt traits by employing a variety of learning biases such as success biased learning where individuals who are perceived as more successful are disproportionately likely to be copied boyd and richerson 1988a laland 2004 as a result the cumulative culture of a population evolves over time as various beliefs and behaviors are preferentially copied and their frequency within a population changes while a full review of cultural evolution is beyond the scope of this paper the general intuition is that populations carry a variable pool of information that is shaped by events in the lives of individuals such as social observation or natural selection mesoudi 2016 this information affects individuals behaviors that in turn may affect their environments and feedback to further alter which traits are adopted in the future durham 1991 henrich and mcelreath 2003 observed variation among groups such as differences in resource management institutions are produced by such social and environmental histories then reinforced through conformist biased learning where the dominant behavioral trait is disproportionately copied henrich and boyd 1998 thus cultural evolution provides an intuitive way to integrate individual decision making population level patterns and even population level behavior environment feedbacks diffusion of novel beliefs and behaviors is a specific instance of cultural evolution where the trait being transmitted is new to the population and outcompetes some previous cultural variant such as in the classic example of hybrid corn seed adoption in iowa farmers mesoudi 2016 ryan and gross 1950 we observe these patterns using diffusion curves that show the proportion of a population that has adopted a belief or behavior on the y axis as a function of time on the x axis hoppitt et al 2010 rogers 2010 ryan and gross 1950 the exact shape of these diffusion curves can be highly dependent on the learning mechanism employed by individuals in the population as well as contextual factors like the population density or ease of trialing the cultural variant smaldino et al 2017 henrich 2001 rogers 2010 in the vast majority of empirical studies the diffusion of a novel trait produces a sigmoidal s shape where it initially spreads slowly followed by a period of rapid adoption then again spreads slowly until it reaches an equilibrium rogers 2010 this s shaped curve is indicative of biased social learning in contrast to the relatively rare r shaped curves observed when individuals learn through independent trial and error fig 1 henrich 2001 the curvilinear r shape produced by individual or environmental learning is a result of the fact that late adopters represent the tail of the distribution having not discovered and thus adopted the novel behavior even after many trials henrich 2001 these two curve shapes however are not completely distinct as the proportion of learning strategies employed by individuals in a population shifts more toward individual or social learning we expect to see a shift toward an r shape or s shape respectively henrich 2001 1 3 diffusion of innovations in community based conservation just as the sigmoidal pattern indicative of social learning is seen in the majority of cases on behavioral adoption broadly scholars have also noticed this pattern in over 80 of case studies on the uptake of community based conservation interventions worldwide mascia and mills 2018 mills et al 2019 fittingly high level studies have begun identifying doi as potentially useful for diagnosing why some community based conservation interventions spread and persist while others fizzle out for example in a review of 22 conservation interventions referenced above the majority of initiatives were adopted by less than 30 of potential adopters at the sigmoidal equilibrium the authors use insights from doi to suggest that practitioners may actively spread information on interventions as in abernethy et al 2014 or facilitate communication to increase adoption rates mills et al 2019 greenhalgh et al 2004 further a recent framework for understanding the establishment persistence and spread of community based conservation practices identifies qualitative insights such as intervention observability from doi as useful in guiding the development of conservation interventions mahajan et al 2020 as these high level studies suggest qualitative insights from doi have been productively applied to understand the rate and success of spread of conservation behaviors in single case studies around the world in kenya for example mbaru and barnes 2017 showed that identifying socially well connected individuals can facilitate the rapid diffusion of information on conservation objectives similarly in fort collins co researchers demonstrated that both the speed and extent of diffusion of information on native plant gardening likely increase when community members are offered incentives to increase communication niemiec et al 2021 romero de diego et al 2021 used expert interviews to identify that observability of benefits was a key driver of the rapid adoption of a voluntary wildlife management program among landholders in mexico conversely in contexts where observability and thus imitation are limited such as across neighboring islands the rate and degree of spread of community based conservation interventions is considerably attenuated pietri et al 2009 this finding mirrors those of studies which look at more general cultural adoption between islands further suggesting that conservation behaviors may spread similarly to technological or ideological innovations kline and boyd 2010 beheim and bell 2011 these studies are compelling in their conclusion that doi can be productively applied to the spread of community based conservation but have been critiqued as general narrative suggestions from doi that may miss important contextual factors unique to each intervention steenbergen et al 2021 lam et al 2020 lund and bluwstein 2018 below we make a quantitative argument for using doi to understand the spread of community based conservation interventions we envision a practitioner who is monitoring the weekly monthly or even yearly uptake rates of an intervention and is hoping to predict if and when it will take off in the population what the final proportion of adopters will be and what they can do to promote its spread in this review we therefore explicitly demonstrate how doi can be used to generate predictions about the patterns of uptake of conservation behaviors given behavior environment feedbacks and diagnose how an intervention may be best improved 1 4 quantitative applications in this section we explain how we can fit an observed pattern of diffusion mathematically to estimate rates of adoption and dropout as well as to predict the speed and degree to which a population will adopt an intervention the s shaped diffusion pattern of behavioral spread over time mirrors that of community disease transmission smaldino and jones 2020 this parallel implies that the well established mathematics used to describe disease transmission patterns can be applied to fitting models of behavioral spread cavalli sforza and feldman 1981 strang 1991 specifically the canonical susceptible infectious recovered sir model and sirs variation where individuals are added back to the pool of susceptibles after recovery eq 1 have been demonstrated to be well suited to fitting the diffusion process famil rohani et al 2019 smaldino and jones 2020 these compartmental differential equations assign every member of a population to a category s i or r depending on the proportion of individuals in the other categories and parameter values for the natural history characteristics of a given disease tolles and luong 2020 in this instantiation the natural history parameter β represents the rate of infection in the population γ represents the rate of recovery and χ is the rate that recovered individuals are added back into the pool of susceptibles 1 d s d t β s t i t χ r t d i d t β s t i t γ i t d r d t γ i t χ r t when the natural history characteristics of some pathogen are known the si sir sis sirs suite of models reliably give accurate deterministic predictions about the number of individuals in a population who will become infected and for how long a disease will persist within a population huppert and katriel 2013 for a specific conservation interventions however there is no way to precisely know the natural history features such as the rate or duration of adoption ahead of time instead the qualitative insights from doi and the study of sustainable resource management institutions referenced above aim to increase the rate of spread and reduce the rate of dropout so that the intervention persists in the population and may even spread to new communities while we can not know exactly what the rates of spread and dropout will be ahead of time we can use bayesian inference to probabilistically estimate them once the project has been implemented margossian 2019 margossian and gillespie 2017 carpenter 2018 knowing these parameters may allow us to predict the final rate of uptake from early in the project identify whether adoption or dropout are limiting the overall rate of uptake and apply the qualitative insights from doi and natural resource management institutions in a more targeted fashion the uptake of community based conservation is subject to behavior environment feedbacks a fundamental difference from behavioral adoption generally liu et al 2007 in the case of marine protected areas for example success in conserving fish populations may actually disincentivize individuals to continue supporting conservation programs christie 2004 a key question then is whether the diffusion models explained above will still reliably fit the spread of conservation behaviors when those behaviors alter the environment and changes in the environment alter the payoff structure of various behavioral choices to answer this question we use an agent based simulation to generate data on the spread of a conservation behavior via social learning contingent on feedbacks with the environment then using the five run average of just the first 30 of the data we probabilistically estimate the average rates of intervention spread dropout readoption using a bayesian instantiation of the sirs model shown in eq 1 we use these estimated parameters to predict the long term average adoption pattern for the remaining 70 of time steps and compare our predicted values to those observed in the simulations while the purpose of this example is to test whether the sirs model can capture our core dynamics of interest it also explicitly demonstrates how a practitioner or other researchers can directly apply the quantitative process described above we first briefly describe the simulation below 2 modeling 2 1 agent based simulation we seek to test whether the sirs model shown in eq 1 can produce reliable insights about community uptake of a conservation behavior especially given behavior environment feedbacks common in natural resource management institutions to answer this question we first need complete time series data in hand that are a product of our dynamics of interest to obtain these data we develop a minimal agent based model that we use to simulate data on the spread of a resource safeguarding behavior within a population müller et al 2013 smajgl et al 2011 in order to assess the impact of feedbacks between behavior and the environment we simulate data using two different social learning strategies only one of which involves a behavior environment feedback le et al 2012 kendal et al 2018 the first is random copying where agents are paired with another agent at random and have a 25 chance of adopting the strategy of the agent they are paired with independent of the harvest benefit provided by adopting the behavior or not mcelreath et al 2008 barrett 2019 this strategy does not involve a direct feedback between behavior and the environment we include it as a baseline to compare against our second strategy which does the second mechanism is success biased learning under which agents disproportionately copy the behaviors of other agents with the greatest harvesting success baldini 2013 this mechanism is formally demonstrated in eq 2 for two behaviors a b where the probability that an individual adopts behavior a is a function of the mean harvest p from each behavior at each time step and the strength of the bias β barrett 2019 under biased social learning the strength of the learning biases e g β control how disproportionately agents copy others based on a given condition e g success a β 1 in this formulation would thus mean that the probability that one agent copies another is directly proportional to the ratio of their harvests behavioral change given success biased learning is therefore dependent on feedbacks with the environment as harvest success results from agent behaviors in previous time steps 2 pr a a b t 1 exp β p a t exp β p a t exp β p b t our simulated system is conceptualized as a fishery where agents are directly compensated for forgoing resource extraction from a particular area if they choose rakotonarivo et al 2021 we establish a fishery loosely based on a global average stock integrity at 20 of its potential carrying capacity fao 2020 in the first time step we introduce an intervention that delineates 20 of the fishery as a conservation area and just 2 of agents initially change their behavior to forgo harvesting there fish reproduce proportionally to the population in each time period and move freely between the conservation area and unconserved area in each subsequent time step agents who adopted the resource safeguarding behavior enrolled receive a reward and continue to harvest just from the remaining 80 of the unconserved fishery agents not enrolled in the intervention harvest from the entire fishery and forgo the reward after each harvest period agents are randomly paired and employ either random copying or success biased learning to decide whether or not to adopt the behavior of their partner in the next time step baldini 2012 the conserved and unconserved resource pools are reduced according to agents harvesting behavior regenerate and move from one area to the other if the carrying capacity is reached in any respective area a visual description of this minimal model is shown in fig 2 and the full overview design concepts and details protocol can be found in the supplemental material s1 grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2020 we use this model to simulate data on the adoption and persistence of a conservation institution given two different learning mechanisms random copying and success biased imitation aside from the learning mechanism employed by the population all model conditions are identical for these two scenarios random copying is used as a reference as it reliably produces the standard sigmoidal s curve of behavioral adoption and does not incorporate any feedbacks between adoption and the environment under the success biased learning scenario agents compare their harvests to others in each time step and disproportionately copy more successful agents in this instantiation then adoption is dependent on harvest success and harvest success is determined largely by the amount of available resources in each area as the amount of available resources in an area is determined by the number of agents who harvest there this learning mechanism incorporates behavior environment feedbacks typical of natural resource management institutions having independently sampled from one or both environments agents then compare their harvests to those of others in each time step in this way the success biased learning scenario actually represents a mix of individual and social learning rather than a scenario where individuals make decisions purely from social information the adoption pattern observed in this simulation results in a mix between an r and s type curve reinforcing the interpretation of this scenario as a mix of individual and social learning henrich 2001 fig 3 shows the full output for five runs of the later simulation where adoption enrollment spikes initially but drops off dramatically as the resources in the unconserved area are reduced following increased harvest pressure there as a result of the conservation intervention this exact dynamic is however highly flexible given the specific parameter combinations as described in section 2 3 2 2 fitting data with probabilistic differential equations with data on adoption of conservation behavior for both learning mechanisms in hand we fit the sirs model described in eq 1 to the first 30 of observations averaged across five model runs we use multiple model runs to avoid spurious results stemming from model stochasticity alone five model runs are used as opposed to 100 or 1000 as this leaves some residual stochasticity in the adoption data that is more representative of what might be realistically observed duplicate analyses to those presented below but instead run on the average of 100 simulation runs can be found in the supplemental material s2 given these data we use probabilistic sampling to infer the parameters β γ and χ for the full bayesian eq 3 below where y t represents the total number of individuals who are enrolled in the community based intervention at any given time here infected individuals are those that are enrolled in the conservation intervention 3 y t b i n o m i a l n i t d s d t β s t i t χ r t d i d t β s t i t γ i t dr dt γ i t χ r t β γ χ n o r m a l 0 0 5 for both learning mechanisms the sirs model exhibited markon chain convergence fig 4 and resulted in an r of 1 for all estimated parameters as the parameters β γ and χ are directly interpretable as the rates of adoption dropout and willingness to retry a previously abandoned intervention accurate estimation of these values especially in the early stages of an intervention provides practical and straightforward intuition to diagnose areas for improvement in community based conservation interventions for example a practitioner might fit this model to real world participation rates during the early weeks of an intervention in order to estimate the rates of adoption and dropout if both rates are low the practitioner should focus on increasing initial adoption conversely if both rates are high they should instead focus efforts on retention of enrolled participants in addition these insights may help practitioners better decide which factors from the institutional design literature may be most impactful for their specific system this might take the form of increasing communication and observability of benefits to boost initial adoption or investing in conflict resolution mechanisms to reduce dropout we can also use these parameter values estimated from the first 30 of the time series to predict the long term patterns of adoption for a community based conservation initiative in figs 5 6 the translucent black lines show 1000 draws from the posterior predicting the proportion of the population who will be enrolled in the intervention at every time step averaged across the five model runs gray and blue points show the initial 30 of the data that was used to estimate the three parameters of interest and the remaining 70 of data respectively these figures show that the sirs model accurately captures and predicts the pattern of behavioral adoption for both random copying and environmentally mediated success biased learning further the mean absolute error mae between the simulated test data later 70 and the median model predictions for those data are 2 98 and 4 52 of the population for the random copying and success biased learning scenarios respectively indicating good model fit figs 5 and 6 also demonstrate that different scenarios and respective learning mechanisms while both producing a stable adoption rate can result in different overall rates in adoption of an intervention even under identical starting conditions in the simulation of a population employing random copying the population equilibrates at nearly 90 adoption of the intervention behavior for success biased learning on the other hand resource scarcity in the unconserved area caused the population to adopt the intervention at approximately 60 in the long term lastly the mix of social and independent learning employed by agents in the success biased learning scenario produces a somewhat r shaped curve as explained in the section above these results show that the sirs model of diffusion can reliably fit the pattern of behavioral adoption even when the pattern does not follow a strict sigmoidal s shape 2 3 example limitations parallel to the examples above we can use our agent based simulation to explore parameter combinations that expose limitations for the application of the sirs diffusion model for capturing and predicting conservation adoption dynamics under behavior environment feedbacks specifically as the parameters in the sirs model only directly account for social processes adoption dynamics resulting from abrupt environmental change are not well predicted for example in fig 7 we consider a resource pool that is relatively intact at the start of the simulation 80 of carrying capacity paired with an unsustainable harvest rate in this simulation all agents initially rapidly enroll in the conservation intervention as there is no cost to doing so resources in the unconserved area are plentiful however when the resource pool in the unconserved area is depleted agents quickly drop out of the conservation institution in favor of harvesting from the conservation area fig 8 shows the result of fitting these data with the sirs diffusion model described above the mae of this model is 43 07 indicating poor model fit to ensure that our modeling approach is generally robust against these types of ecologically driven dynamics we again ran five iterations of the agent based model and assessed sirs model fit for a wide range of parameter combinations as shown in fig 9 and in our supplemental materials s3 our approach yields reliable model fit as assessed through mae across the spectrum of realistic parameter values it is worth noting however that the sirs model fails to capture trends in conservation adoption in boundary cases such as when 80 90 of resources are designated for conservation fig 9 this indicates that the method presented in this paper may not be appropriate for real world application where adoption dynamics are expected to be heavily driven by ecological change rather than social dynamics 3 discussion 3 1 shortcomings of diffusion of innovations in community based conservation as demonstrated in figs 5 6 the standard sirs diffusion model can reliably capture the long term patterns of behavioral adoption for community based conservation interventions even when adoption is contingent on feedbacks with ecological processes fitting this model to observed data on the uptake of a behavior can provide us with estimates of the rates of adoption dropout and willingness to retry a specific intervention and allow us to predict the final stable rate of adoption in the population from early in the project these insights while useful are somewhat limited in their ability to prescribe improvements for an intervention as highlighted by the quote in the beginning of this article diffusion study can explain what is happening in a system but gives little intuition as to the mechanisms behind why it is happening rogers 2010 as first described by henrich 2001 and demonstrated in figs 5 6 we see clear changes in the population patterns of adoption when individuals employ differing levels of social or independent learning but when comparing many biased social learning mechanisms the pattern of adoption may exhibit equifinality where many different underlying mechanisms may produce similar or even identical patterns over time barrett 2019 critically this makes it virtually impossible to infer the specific biased social learning mechanism s used by a population from the pattern of adoption over time alone this information is however important for researchers and practitioners as the social transmission mechanism or mix of mechanisms employed by a population can dramatically affect the overall rates of adoption for a given behavior smaldino et al 2017 andrews and borgerhoff mulder 2018 tam et al 2021 plainly doi can tell us if an intervention is being robustly adopted or not but we need to understand the actual transmission mechanism to effectively act on this information thankfully this information is possible to collect for example tam et al 2021 and kline et al 2018 give practical examples of how to measure social learning strategies in the context of conservation and tools game survey instrument code etc with which to collect and analyze the data with information on the patterns and mechanisms of uptake of community based conservation behaviors we can more selectively apply the many narrative insights from doi and the study of natural resource management institutions in populations primarily employing prestige biased learning where prestigious individuals are disproportionately copied for instance the identification of and collaboration with community change agents may be particularly effective jiménez and mesoudi 2019 henrich and gil white 2001 dietz et al 2002 conversely the observability of both resources and the benefits of conservation are likely of increased importance when the population primarily employs content biased learning where some characteristic of the trait itself makes it more desirable than a previous trait ostrom 1990 rogers 2010 boyd and richerson 1988b 3 2 future work understanding the causal mechanisms behind the patterns of behavioral transmission is necessary to better delineate and predict how conservation will affect both people and the environment cheng et al 2020 researchers increasingly recognize that models of human caused environmental change must explicitly incorporate dynamic social processes based on realistic human cognitions that allow actors to modify their behaviors in response to new information meyfroidt 2013 turner et al 2021 polain de waroux et al 2021 behavioral adoption is not truly binary as implied by doi rather individuals modify behaviors they adopt in response to their personal experiences and needs enquist et al 2011 research on cultural evolution has accordingly begun to incorporate these cognitive processes into formal models gabora and steel 2017 2020 hence modeling human behavior in the context of community based conservation is in its infancy going forward it will require a complex dynamic systems approach in which behaviors and the biophysical environment coevolve schill et al 2019 mechanistic or process models allow for us to formally describe these complex interactions while testing the logical consequences of our assumptions and the relation of our hypothesized processes to observed data epstein 2008 the practice of applying statistical frameworks for parameter estimation to analytical process models particularly ordinary differential equations is still relatively new and has been embraced mostly in ecology hefley et al 2017 laubmeier et al 2020 morales and morán lópez 2021 this emerging methodology allows for estimating interesting and directly interpretable process parameters which is not possible with linear regression we believe this is an exciting new avenue for conservation science as the direct interpretability and applicability of process parameters lend themselves well to tight integration with applied research as is common in the field future research could extend the sirs diffusion model to include an exposure term i e seirs to allow for individual variation in the exposure to an intervention required before adoption possibly dependent on individual characteristics an additional line of research aimed at better capturing the trends shown in figs 7 8 might include a term that represents change in the environment over time and the effect of resource levels on adoption rates to more accurately reflect the social ecological coupling as exemplified in figs 7 through 9 any model that predicts human behavior due to past behavioral dynamics will fail to capture trends driven primarily by environmental conditions an example of such an extension is presented below where we include another equation for the change in a resource pool over time d e d t we also must include three additional parameters ϕ ρ and θ which represent the effect of resource level on enrollment infection the effect of harvest on the resource level and the regeneration rate of the resource respectively 4 d s d t β s t i t χ r t d i d t β s t i t γ i t ϕ e t d r d t γ i t χ r t ϕ e t d e d t ρ s t r t θ e t while process models may be preferable to simulation and linear regression approaches for predicting adoption outcomes of conservation interventions they might not always be possible in complex systems these models can quickly require many parameters in order to account for all moving parts accurately and thus are prone to issues of identifiability in parameter estimation and may even become mathematically intractable laubmeier et al 2020 further as has been demonstrated in coastal fisheries these systems can exhibit mathematical chaos where our inability to measure the parameters of interest at a fine enough resolution results in seemingly stochastic unpredictable outcomes wilson et al 1994 coupled human and natural systems commonly exhibit dynamics with thresholds time lags and heterogeneity not present in social or natural systems in isolation and therefore are difficult to model analytically liu et al 2007 in very complex cases such as these we argue that agent based simulations are the preferred approach as they allow for these features of complex systems that are difficult or even impossible to account for with analytical process models such the sirs or sirs extension model presented in eq 4 reyers et al 2018 railsback and grimm 2012 wilensky and rand 2015 agent based simulations allow modelers to impose a realism in the governance or institutional dynamics that are largely intractable in closed form mathematical equations et al 2020 bravo 2011 joffre et al 2015 further agent based simulations uniquely allow researchers to hypothesize and test causal processes in complex social ecological systems baggio and hillis 2018 schlüter et al 2019 as the number of purely subsistence communities shrinks each year worldwide and multiple levels of institutions are increasingly involved in natural resource management incorporating these features into our models is paramount for reliable inference mckean 2000 armitage et al 2009 4 conclusions overall we argue that fitting process models of behavioral diffusion to data on the spread of conservation behaviors is a practical way for researchers and practitioners to apply doi to community based conservation we test the utility of the sirs diffusion model on simulated data that highlight the feedback between behavioral adoption and environmental change commonly seen in community based conservation interventions we show that this model can be a powerful tool for estimating the natural history characteristics of a particular intervention such as the rate of spread and for predicting the long term patterns of adoption even under reciprocal behavior environment interactions we also introduce the broader field of cultural evolution as a more comprehensive body of theory for understanding the underlying mechanisms of behavioral adoption than doi alone we hope that this review provides a model for how practitioners might practically apply insights from doi to community based conservation interventions while also

24352,water quality improvement to avoid excessive phytoplankton blooms often requires eutrophication management where both phosphorus p and nitrogen n play a role while empirical eutrophication studies and ecological resource competition theory both provide insight into phytoplankton abundance in response to nutrient loading they are not seamlessly linked in the current state of eutrophication research we argue that understanding species competition for multiple nutrients and light in natural phytoplankton communities is key to assessing phytoplankton abundance under changing nutrient supply here we present gplake s a mechanistic model rooted in ecological resource competition theory which has only eight parameters and can predict chlorophyll a to nutrient relationships for phytoplankton communities under n p n p colimitation and light limitation gplake s offers a simple mechanistic tool to make first estimates of chlorophyll a levels and nutrient thresholds for generic lake properties accounting for variation in n p ratio preferences of phytoplankton species this makes the model supportive of water management and policy keywords water quality management consumer resource interactions ecological modelling phosphorus limitation nitrogen limitation nutrient colimitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication is a hallmark of the anthropocene all over the world increased anthropogenic input of phosphorus p and nitrogen n to aquatic ecosystems causes water quality problems conley et al 2009 thornton et al 2013 eutrophication threatens drinking water supplies fisheries bathing water and the aesthetic value of natural and recreational water bodies paerl 1988 carpenter et al 1998 these problems are due to large amounts of phytoplankton which water quality managers generally express in terms of chlorophyll a hereafter shortened to chl a levels the excessive production of phytoplankton can outcompete plants through shading scheffer et al 1993 and cause oxygen depletion hallegraeff 2003 in addition some phytoplankton species produce toxins that are harmful to humans and animals carmichael 2001 codd et al 2005 excessive phytoplankton abundance is strongly driven by p and n loading from among other sources fertilizer and sewage water inputs into aquatic ecosystems conley et al 2009 nutrient load reduction seems the most fundamental solution to mitigate eutrophication problems jeppesen et al 2007 however careful estimation of what nutrients are limiting phytoplankton abundance and to what amount nutrient inputs should be reduced are required because management efforts are costly and will have socio economic implications janssen et al 2019 2020 specifically an important question of eutrophication management is to what extent p and n loadings should be reduced to meet water quality standards that are acceptable to society and prescribed by legislation european commission 2000 there are two scientific domains that provide insight into the excessive production of phytoplankton in response to nutrient loading empirical eutrophication studies data driven models vollenweider 1968 dillon and rigler 1974 schindler 1974 nürnberg 1984 and ecological resource competition theory tilman 1982 huisman and weissing 1994 the latter approach is usually also in different forms incorporated in process based ecosystem models janse et al 2008 janssen et al 2015 empirical eutrophication studies aim to reveal which levels of phytoplankton abundance can be expected in natural systems at a given level of nutrient loading and how acceptable levels can be ensured through water quality management one of the most widely applied eutrophication models was developed by vollenweider 1968 it is an empirical model that describes the relationship between p loading and chl a levels through statistical analysis of data from several hundred lakes worldwide later on others expanded vollenweider s seminal approach to lakes with different characteristics whilst maintaining the same model structure and goal reckhow and chapra 1983 kimmel and groeger 1984 nürnberg 1984 lijklema et al 1989 based on the seminal work of schindler schindler 1974 most of the earlier studies focus on the relationship between p and chl a dillon and rigler 1974 canfield jr et al 1981 wagner et al 2011 while later empirical models also included other factors like nitrogen as evidence arose that other limitations could be equally important rousso et al 2020 filstrup and downing 2017 on the other hand ecological resource competition theory focuses on the mechanistic underpinning of species coexistence under variable ratios of nutrient supply tilman 1982 and incident light huisman and weissing 1994 but ignores the consequences for overall chl a levels while the scientific domains of empirical eutrophication studies and ecological resource competition theory both address the relationship between nutrients light and phytoplankton abundance they are not seamlessly linked empirical eutrophication studies are generally aimed at managing excessive phytoplankton abundance in aquatic ecosystems without concern for underlying mechanisms of species competition for resources vollenweider 1968 smith and schindler 2009 moreover empirical eutrophication studies have been largely focussing on p only for a long time although later models included also other factors following discussion on e g the role of n limitation in conley et al 2009 paerl 2009 ecological resource competition theory tends to focus on the outcomes of competition in terms of species coexistence and on resource depletion rather than on the resulting abundance of the community as a whole tilman 1982 huisman and weissing 1994 and offers mechanistic insights into the role of both p and n supply ratios for phytoplankton consumer resource dynamics but it mostly stays short of making predictions of total chl a levels under natural conditions here we strive to combine the ecosystem level predictions of chl a levels under changing nutrient supply from empirical eutrophication studies with a mechanistic understanding of how the balance of resources in the form of light and multiple nutrients shapes species interactions of phytoplankton communities according to ecological resource competition theory in this paper we present the gplake s model where gplake stands for generically parameterized lake model and s stands for stoichiometry the philosophy of gplake chang et al 2019 and gplake s this study is to provide simple but mechanistic tools that can give a first estimate of chl a level and limiting factor in eutrophication management for a wide range of lake characteristics chang et al 2019 specifically we aim to develop a model that gives predictions of chl a levels in natural systems under a wide range of p and n loadings based on the first principles of ecological resource competition theory tilman 1982 whereas the original gplake model focuses on the shift from a single limiting nutrient to light limitation along a gradient of nutrient loading chang et al 2019 the expanded model gplake s presented here describes the relationship between multiple limiting nutrients and average chl a levels at equilibrium for natural communities of phytoplankton a key assumption of gplake s is that the species in natural communities of phytoplankton cover a diverse spectrum of stoichiometric demands that allows the community to adjust to a range of nutrient supply ratios to develop gplake s we address the following research questions 1 what are the first principles that determine the relationship between phytoplankton abundance and the loading of two limiting nutrients according to ecological resource competition theory 2 how can we capture the stoichiometric variability in natural communities of phytoplankton for two limiting nutrients in ecological resource competition models and what assumptions do we make in doing so 3 what types of resource limitations emerge in gplake s and what are the equilibria for chl a p and n for each type 4 how can we find generic parameters for gplake s based on field lab and model data 2 methods 2 1 theoretical background for gplake s we based our model on explicit ecological resource competition theory sensu tilman 1982 for the case of a single species with biomass concentration w1 mg m 3 growing with michaelis menten kinetics michaelis and menten 1913 cornish bowden 2015 on a single resource with concentration r1 mg m 3 we defined the model with chemostat dynamics referred to further as the 1r1w tm model where 1r1w represents the case of one species competing for one resource and tm represents a tilman type model the equations for this model are as follows 1 d r 1 d t n e t s u p p l y o f r 1 c o n s u m p t i o n o f r 1 b y w 1 d r 1 i n r 1 c r 1 w 1 p w 1 m a x r 1 r 1 h r 1 w 1 w 1 2 d w 1 d t p r o d u c t i o n o f w 1 l o s s o f w 1 p w 1 m a x r 1 r 1 h r 1 w 1 w 1 l w 1 w 1 where d day 1 is the dilution rate r1 in mg m 3 the inflowing nutrient concentration cr1 w1 mg mg 1 is the stoichiometric constant describing the amount of resource per unit of species pw1 max day 1 is the maximum species specific growth rate hr1 w1 mg m 3 is the resource concentration at which the realized specific growth equals half the maximum specific growth rate and lw1 day 1 is the specific loss rate of the species the subscript r1 w1 means that the parameters with those subscripts are for the case of one resource and one phytoplankton species for this system to be in equilibrium the mass balance equation of the resource should be fulfilled fig 1 3 d r 1 i n r 1 w 1 l w 1 c r 1 w 1 w 1 where the asterisks represent equilibrium values here the left hand term reflects the amount of resources that flow into the system minus what flows out whereas the right hand term reflects the loss rate of the resource due to the loss of the species this fundamental equation forms the basis of the nutrient limited phase of gplake chang et al 2019 an important assumption in gplake is that for realistic parameterizations of phytoplankton growing under p limitation the resource concentration at equilibrium r 1 w1 mg m 3 can be ignored because it is low when phytoplankton are in the p limited growth phase and hardly affects the equilibrium concentration of biomass w 1 mg m 3 thus we simplify the above mass balance to 4 d r 1 i n l w 1 c r 1 w 1 w 1 hence this results in an explicit formula for the equilibrium phytoplankton concentration under nutrient limitation 5 w 1 d l w 1 r 1 i n c r 1 w 1 please note that the equilibrium density of species is not only inversely proportional to the stoichiometric constant cr1 w1 but also proportional to the ratio of the dilution rate d and the specific species loss rate lw1 hence the higher the specific species loss rate of species in the system the lower the abundance of the species is under chemostat conditions with d equal to lw1 this further simplifies to 6 w 1 r 1 i n c r 1 w 1 moreover when tilman s resource competition model is expanded to two species competing for two resources 2r2w the equilibrium of the model has four possible outcomes these outcomes depend on the relative magnitudes of the single species single resource equilibrium values the supply concentrations of two resources and the ratio of the stoichiometric constants see fig 2 a for the configuration we studied here and appendix 1 for the equations of the 2r2w tm model and its graphical expressions of all four possible competition outcomes 2 2 applying competition theory to natural communities the aim of this study is to focus on natural communities of phytoplankton growing under p and n limitation this calls for a version of tilman s resource competition model with a large number of n species wi competing for two resources with liebig s law of the minimum here denoted as the 2rnw tm model the basic equations for this model are 7 d r 1 d t n e t s u p p l y o f r 1 s u m o f c o n s u m p t i o n o f r 1 b y w i d r 1 i n r 1 i c r 1 w i p w i w i 8 d r 2 d t n e t s u p p l y o f r 2 s u m o f c o n s u m p t i o n o f r 2 b y w i d r 2 i n r 2 i c r 2 w i p w i w i 9 d w i d t p r o d

equations of both resources should be fulfilled 11 d r 1 i n r 1 i l w i c r 1 w i w i 12 d r 2 i n r 2 i l w i c r 2 w i w i these equations generalize equations a1 7 and a1 8 in appendix 1 to multiple species obviously there will be constraints on the maximum and minimum values of the stoichiometric constants in the community following danger et al 2008 we referred to the species with the highest value of cr2 wi cr1 wi so the species relatively high in r2 as species wα and the species with the lowest value of cr2 wi cr1 wi so relatively high in r1 as species wβ hence for any species wi in the community it should hold that c r 2 w α c r 1 w α c r 2 w i c r 1 w i c r 2 w β c r 1 w β along comparable lines of reasoning as with the 2r2w tm model the outcome of the competition between the community of species wα wβ for two resources r1 and r2 in the 2rnw tm model is determined by the relative magnitude of the single species single resource equilibrium values r 1 wi and r 2 wi the supply concentrations of nutrients r1 in and r2 in and the stoichiometric constants cr1 wi and cr2 wi the outcome can be exclusion of all but one species or coexistence of two species see fig 2a and appendix 1 for the n 2 case to implement the 2rnw model we need to parameterize it for each of the species in the community we did so by repeatedly defining new species with intermediate nutrient requirements through geometric interpolation to exemplify this for the first step from 2 to 3 species we defined 13 c r 1 w i n t e r m e d i a t e c r 1 w α c r 1 w β 14 c r 2 w i n t e r m e d i a t e c r 2 w α c r 2 w β where wα and wβ represent the two species with the most extreme ratios of the stoichiometric constants and wintermediate represents the species that have a geometrically averaged value of consumption vector from there we proceeded to define 5 species and finally 9 species assuming that a further step to 17 species and beyond would yield little additional information to concentrate our analysis on those species that potentially can coexist pairwise with the other species in the community given that the ratio at which both resources are supplied to the system is intermediate to the requirements of that specific couple of species we made the following assumptions on the r 1 wi and r 2 wi of each species such that 15 r 2 w i r 1 w i c r 2 w i c r 1 w i and we defined that 16 r 1 w i r 2 w i c r the resulting 2r9w tm model is illustrated in fig 2b 2 3 developing a model for natural communities of phytoplankton while the above described community resource competition model is of a general nature and well rooted in ecological theory in this study we specifically apply it to natural communities of phytoplankton competing for phosphorus and nitrogen in the context of empirical eutrophication studies and call the resulting model gplake s from here on therefore we refer to r1 and r2 as p mg p m 3 and n mg p m 3 respectively in the first step towards a practical model structure we examined the required model complexity in terms of the number of species n for a 2rnw model to capture the abundance of phytoplankton in terms of chl a levels mg chl a m 3 along a nutrient supply ratio gradient nin pin from zero to infinity properly given our assumptions on the characteristics of the intermediate species to do so we compared the analytical solution of chl a levels along a nutrient supply ratio gradient for an infinite number of species with model calculations of 2 3 5 and 9 species models called the 2r2w 2r3w 2r5w and 2r9w tm models respectively in the second step we parameterized the gplake s model continuing the strategy employed in gplake chang et al 2019 we generically parameterized gplake s for reasonable ranges of stoichiometric constants of natural communities of phytoplankton on the basis of field data lab data and model data 3 results 3 1 choosing the number of species in gplake s initially we studied the impact of varying the number of species to represent a natural community of phytoplankton in gplake s given our assumptions on defining intermediate species by analysing a number of tm models of increasing species complexity specifically we carried out analyses with the 2r2w 2r3w 2r5w and 2r9w tm models along a gradient of zero to infinity of ratios of inflowing nutrient concentrations pin and nin that can be described by 17 10 p i n n i n 2000 with pin 0 and nin 0 expressed in mg p m 3 and mg n m 3 respectively the unit of the number 10 used in the gradient equation is mgn mgp 1 for the parameter settings used in this analysis see appendix 2 the resulting abundance of the species and the total calculated chl a levels for the 2r2w tm model show three zones along a nutrient supply ratio gradient a positive linear response of chl a levels to the supply of p under p limitation a plateau with a gradual replacement of species wα by species wβ and finally a negative linear response to the supply of n under n limitation fig 3 a in the 2r3w tm model this plateau is replaced by a linear increase in chl a levels as species wα is replaced by the intermediate species wμ under colimitation by p and n and a linear decrease to as species wμ is replaced by species wβ again under colimitation fig 3b further splitting the community into 5 and 9 species fig 3c and d respectively gradually refines the zone of colimitation into a convex unimodal curve with a maximum chl a level in the case of a monoculture of the species wμ with the intermediate nutrient requirements of the community we obtained the curve for n going to infinity under colimitation by calculating the abundance of the optimal species w i i e the species for which cn wi cp wi nin pin with the additional constraint that cp wα cn wα cp wi cn wi cp wβ cn wβ under p limitation 18 200 p i n 0 19 n i n 2000 10 p i n 20 c p w i c p w α c n w α p i n n i n 21 w i p i n c p w i or we could equally have used n limitation 22 0 n i n 2000 23 p i n 200 n i n 10 24 c n w i c p w α c n w α n i n p i n 25 w i n i n c n w i resulting in the same values for w i in the zone of colimitation the 2r2w 2r3w 2r5w and 2r9w tm models show average deviations of 11 5 3 2 0 9 and 0 3 differences respectively when compared with the algebraic solution for n goes to infinity of the 2rnw tm model on the basis of these analyses we consider the 2r3w tm model with species wα wμ and wβ to be the most parsimonious and we used it to further develop gplake s 3 2 derivation of gplake s having chosen to describe the community of phytoplankton in terms of three characteristic species wα wμ and wβ we can now derive equations for the expected n p and chl a concentrations for any given combination of pin and nin here α denotes the species with the highest n p ratio while β represents the species with the lowest n p ratio and μ is the species that is intermediate in its requirements for p and n for these three species we derived equations for the equilibrium chl a p and n concentration under five types of limitation 1 a p limited system with a monoculture of wα 2 a p and n co limited system with the coexistence of wα and wμ 3 a p and n co limited system with the coexistence of wμ and wβ 4 an n limited system with a monoculture of wβ and finally 5 a light limited system with an undefined coexistence of wα wμ and wβ these equations represent five planes with pin as x coordinate nin as the y coordinate and chl a as the z coordinate projecting out of the plane fig 4 please note that in deriving these equations we made the same assumption as in gplake namely that for realistic parameterizations of phytoplankton growing under nutrient limitation the r value of the limiting nutrient can be ignored because it hardly affects the equilibrium concentration w plane 1 p limited plane with a monoculture of wα 26 c h l p d l p i n c p w α 27 n p n i n c n w α c p w α p i n 28 p p 0 plane 2 p and n limited plane with the coexistence

respect to light competition of the α β and μ species in the light limited phase instead we here assume that the stoichiometric composition of the phytoplankton under light limitation complies with that of the μ species each plane represents a limitation and the realized equilibrium chl a level is determined by 39 c h l g p l a k e s min c h l p c h l p n c h l n p c h l n c h l l thus the limiting factor can be identified by checking in which planes the realized equilibrium chl a level is the minimum under certain nutrients supply once this limitation is known the matching equations for calculating p and n can be applied we call this model gplake s as it represents the stoichiometric extension of the original gplake model see table 1 for a full list of symbols of gplake s with units and descriptions 3 3 parameterization of gplake s to enable gplake s to be applied to real cases we needed a set of parameters defining stoichiometric characteristics of the extreme species α and β and of the intermediate species μ in gplake s please note that we express n p ratios throughout this study as ratios of weights as noted in the definitions for eq 17 empirically measured ranges of n p mass ratios under field conditions are given by downing and mccauley 1992 from their table we took the n p mass ratio of 20 0 for algae p deficient as an estimate of cn wα cp wα and their value of 7 0 for algae whole community as an estimate of cn wβ cp wβ for an empirically measured range of n p ratios under experimental conditions we referred to the work by klausmeier et al 2004 and took their value of 20 0 for synechococcus spp as an estimate of cn wα cn wα and their value of 3 2 for melosira binderana as an estimate of cn wβ cp wβ for model data we referred to the parameters of the bloom ii model of phytoplankton dynamics los 2009 specifically we used the values of 19 3 for aphanizomenon spp phosphorus type i e phosphorus limited type as an estimate of cn wα cp wα and their value of 4 1 for microcystis spp nitrogen type i e nitrogen limited type as an estimate of cn wβ cp wβ see table 2 for an overview of these parameters we assume that these data sources cover the stoichiometry variability of phytoplankton species in a wide range of p deficient n deficient and colimitation conditions and hence can provide a sufficiently wide range for the stoichiometric variability of a phytoplankton community under natural conditions as explained above we defined the n p mass ratio of the intermediate species wμ through geometric averaging of the n p mass ratios of the α and β species resulting in an estimate of cn wμ cp wμ 9 44 the next step in parameterizing gplake s consists of obtaining values of the stoichiometric constraints nutrient chla ratios for the α β and μ species based on the bloom ii parameter table los 2009 we chose cp wμ 0 7 g p g chl a for the intermediate species setting this value allows us to calculate the other five stoichiometric constants given the average n p mass ratio of 9 44 we got cn wμ 6 61 g n g chl a next we calculated the stoichiometric constants of the α and β species on basis of two considerations 1 the ratio of n p of the α and β species should comply with the estimate of cn wα cp wα and cn wβ cp wβ respectively and 2 the multiplication of the n and the p content of each species should obey a tradeoff comparable to the tradeoff that we assume for the r values here this tradeoff is defined as cp wα cn wα cp wμ cn wμ cp wβ cn wβ see appendix 3 for the resulting equations and table 3 for the resulting parameter values the last step in the parameterization aims at making sure that gplake s complies with gplake we did so by assuming that gplake represents the mono culture of the μ species and that in gplake the ratio of nin and pin complies with cn wμ cp wμ in that case we can make the two models compatible by first calculating the slope parameter of gplake chang et al 2019 given the depth and residence time of the lake of interest and from there calculate the ratio between the dilution rate over the community loss rate of phytoplankton with the formula d l cp wμ slopegplake moreover we can calculate the maximum level of chl a at which light limitation occurs in gplake s based on the plateau parameter of gplake chang et al 2019 calculated for the same set of lake characteristics as was used for calculating the slope parameter 3 4 outcome of gplake s we are now in the position to make predictions of chl a levels for any given combination of pin and nin based on the depth and residence time of a system of interest as an example we chose the same set of characteristics that were used in gplake chang et al 2019 this example dealt with a lake a depth of 2 meters and a residence time of 167 days the resulting values of the slope and plateau parameters of gplake were 0 689 g chl a g p 1 and 97 0 mg chl a m 3 respectively table 3 please note that these values of slopegplake and plateaugplake were obtained by calculating pin in mg p m 3 from nutrient loading in mg p m 2 year 1 using vollenweider s method for normalization by water depth and residence time see eq 9 and the explanation thereof in chang et al 2019 from there the ratio between the dilution rate and the community loss rate of phytoplankton was calculated by d l cp wμ slopegplake this resulted in a dimensionless value of 0 483 for d l with this we had values for all parameters needed to calculate the five planes of gplake s each of them representing a specific type of limitation according to the equations for chl a p chl a pn chl a np chl a n and chl a l as a function of pin and nin presented above and as a final step we calculated the predicted value of chl a gplake s by taking the minimum of these values and in doing so identified which factor actually limits phytoplankton abundance this knowledge then allowed us to calculate p gplake s and n gplake s by using the equations that match the corresponding limitation planes fig 4 we present the outcomes of gplake s in this study for a range of inflowing p concentrations of 0 pin 250 mg p m 3 and on the basis of the average ratio between p and n in our modelled community of phytoplankton for a range of inflowing n concentrations of 0 nin 2500 mg n m 3 the resulting values of chl a gplake s are presented in fig 4 by the intensity of the green colour this figure shows which type of limitation occurred for a given combination of pin and nin p limitation pn colimitation np colimitation n limitation or light limitation the equations for the lines that specify the levels of inflowing nutrients where switches between types of limitations occur are shown in appendix 4 3 5 applying gplake s along a nutrient supply ratio gradient finally we compared our prediction of chl a by gplake s along a nutrient supply ratio gradient dashed line in fig 4 against the predicted chl a levels for each of the phytoplankton species and types that are covered by the bloom ii model los 2009 and against the prediction made by gplake chang et al 2019 to start with the latter comparison gplake focusses on p limitation only while assuming that the supply of n varies accordingly to meet the stoichiometric demands of those phytoplankton species that are present in the system this means that gplake deals with those combinations of supply ratios that fall on the line that separates the pn co limited from the np co limited planes of gplake s as depicted in fig 4 and this also means that gplake only makes predictions for a single line that is a single value of nutrient supply ratio on the nutrient supply ratio gradient depicted in fig 4 when compared with the predictions for phytoplankton species and types that are covered by the bloom ii parameter table see appendix 5 two things catch the eye following the logic of our community expansion of the tilman model for resource competition each of these species is plotted along the nutrient supply ratio gradient according to its stoichiometric demands the range in these demands closely matches the zones of pn and np colimitation this stems from the fact that the range of stoichiometric demands of the species and types in bloom ii coincides well with the combined range based on field lab and model data presented in table 2 with respect to chl a predictions the gplake s prediction matches the average of the wide variation in predictions per species and types from the bloom ii parameter table fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 towards a generically parameterized model of lake eutrophication that takes stoichiometric ratios and constraints into account in developing gplake s we have taken an important step forward in understanding and predicting the impacts of eutrophication by multiple potentially limiting nutrients on phytoplankton abundance in natural systems our aims with the model are to provide water quality managers with a model that 1 can be used for predicting chl a levels considering combinations of p and n loadings 2 can identify the limiting factor i e phosphorus nitrogen both phosphorus and nitrogen or light of the target ecosystem 3 can be parameterized with data sources from lab field and model studies and 4 is easy to use and requires a limited number of inputs that are available to water quality managers while eutrophication is often considered as a singular pressure the body of evidence of it being two conjoint pressures in freshwater systems namely p and n pollution has become undeniable paerl et al 2016b lewis et al 2020 while ecological resource competition theory has long delved into such concepts the link towards chl a prediction using these models has remained largely absent gplake s fills this gap building on ecological resource competition theory to deliver a minimalist mechanistic model for predicting chl a under scenarios of two competing nutrients our results of the gplake s model show it to be capable of distinguishing between different types of limitation n p n p and light limitation commonly described in real world lake systems see e g lewis et al 2020 while predicting the resulting chl a as a measure of phytoplankton abundance 4 2 design considerations underlying gplake s the basis of the gplake s model is firmly rooted in ecological resource competition theory sensu tilman 1982 and huisman and weissing 1995 the basis of stoichiometric limits i e the α and β species is well accepted in the field of ecological stoichiometry and has a clear empirical basis klausmeier et al 2004 danger et al 2008 teurlincx et al 2017 the selection of the optimal number of species to describe the nutrient to chl a relationship fig 3 may be questioned however the concept of productivity and its link to biodiversity is often debated and examined in the context of biodiversity ecosystem functioning bef literature striebel et al 2009 2012 jochum et al 2020 within the bef framework small increases in ecosystem functioning e g resource use or other processes can often be attributed to increasing biodiversity leading to the notion that the inclusion of more species in a model is per definition meaningful our goal however is somewhat different in that we are looking for first order estimates of phytoplankton abundance in the form of chl a levels rather than to try to answer the question regarding biodiversity and productivity per se this has led us to choose what is model wise the least complex solution with a reasonable fit we restrict ourselves to the questions posed in eutrophication management revolve around the amount of chl a produced nonetheless it is important to note that the inclusion of some level of biodiversity i e three species in the model is necessary to make sound predictions of chl a nutrient relations given our assumption of the characteristics of those species such interest for biodiversity in simple models has gained increasing traction in ecological consumer resource based bef modelling danger et al 2008 parain et al 2019 here we show that biodiversity in terms of functional algal groups is also important when using ecological consumer resource theory to predict chl a as a measure of phytoplankton abundance 4 3 the empirical basis of gplake s a total of eight parameters are required to apply gplake s the six stoichiometric constants for p and n of the three species α β and μ the ratio between the dilution rate and the phytoplankton community loss rate and finally the upper limit of chl a due to light limitation these latter two parameters are derived from the slope and plateau of gplake to calculate the slope and plateau of gplake we need the c1 and c2 parameters of that model and the depth and residence time of the lake under consideration the resulting parameters of gplake s for the default setting of gplake for a lake with a depth of 2 meters and a residence time 167 days are given in table 3 and the equations to calculate them in appendix 3 following the design principles of gplake we collected information about the stoichiometric variability in terms of maximum and minimum n p ratios based on field lab and model data n p ratios of phytoplankton are widely published hillebrand et al 2013 de senerpont domis et al 2014 tanioka and matsumoto 2020 and have historically been used to define the limiting nutrient in lake ecosystems see e g faafeng and hessen 1993 less common is information about the p chl a and n chl a ratios needed to parameterize the six stoichiometric constants of gplake s of the three data sources used for the n p ratios only the bloom ii parameter table also specifies the p chl a and n chl a ratios using carbon content as an intermediate step this is not a coincidence as the approach taken in the bloom ii model overlaps with that of gplake s in the sense that both models recognize the importance of algal n p ratios in predicting algal abundances and take into account that a semi continuous range of those ratios is present in natural algal communities for some of the basic design principles of bloom ii and how these relate to the tilman model of ecological resource competition see appendix 6 because the parameter value of stoichiometric constant is key to gplake s we chose to estimate the stoichiometric constant of the intermediate species μ for phosphorus cp wμ from the bloom ii parameter table and calculated the other five stoichiometric constants based on that value using the equations provided in appendix 3 one may question this approach for two reasons what are the consequences of starting with the parametrization with cp wμ instead of one of the other five stoichiometric constants and in what way are the predicted chl a levels dependent on the specific value we chose acknowledging that we used a single data source here in contradiction with the gplake philosophy to combine the strength of field lab and model data in finding generic parameters the simple but also surprising answer to these questions is that neither the order of parametrization nor even the value we chose for cp wμ has an impact on the chl a levels predicted by gplake s this insensitivity exists because for reasons of consistency of gplake s with gplake we estimated the ratio of the dilution rate over the phytoplankton community loss rate d l gplake s by multiplying the slope parameter obtained from gplake by the estimated value of cp wμ according to the formula d l cp wμ slopegplake any change in our estimate of cp wμ will therefore result in a proportional change in d l gplake s and in each of the equations of gplake s whether it be the equations within the planes where the chl a levels are predicted as functions of pin and nin under the five different limitations or it be in the equations of the lines that specify the relation between pin and nin at which there is a switch in the type of limitation these proportional changes in each of the six stoichiometric constants and d l gplake s will cancel out this leaves the predicted chl a levels and the type of limitation that occurs unchanged this brings us to the important conclusion that gplake s inherits its estimates for the intermediate species that thrive under intermediate n p ratios from the elaborate parametrization of gplake based on the vollenweider data the selected lab experiments and the runs with pclake see chang et al 2019 this also leads to the conclusion that the only additional empirical data needed to parameterize gplake s given a parameterized gplake are the n p ratios of the α and β species 4 4 omitting light nutrient colimitation in gplake s in the development of gplake s we expanded the contrast between nutrient and light limitation that is key to gplake to the concept of nutrient colimitation in combination with the choice to represent stoichiometric variability in natural communities of phytoplankton in three species α β and μ that represent a high low and intermediate n p ratio this results in five possible types of limitation as depicted in fig 4 of course these limitations are only a subset of the factors that might limit phytoplankton abundance under natural conditions prominent among these factors is the colimitation of light and nutrients brauer et al 2012 this occurs when in the light gradient over depth phytoplankton is nutrient limited near the surface but light limited near the sediment while addressing such colimitation would fit in our philosophy of gplake s with respect to ecological complexity we omitted it for the practical reason that we do not know of analytical expressions for the equilibrium values of chl a under such colimitation adding light nutrient limitation would therefore prohibit us from developing a simple tool for applying gplake s in water quality management e g it would cause technical complexity to the use of gplake s that we considered undesirable as a result the predictions of gplake s for pin and nin values for which light nutrient colimitation would likely occur will be overestimated being necessarily an overestimate the gplake s chl a should therefore be seen as a worst case scenario under those circumstances in field fig 6 4 5 relevance for water management and policy freshwater eutrophication management and policy have a long history of focussing on the reduction of phosphorus inputs to lakes to attempt to revert the damage to the ecosystem by anthropogenic pollution see e g carpenter et al 1999 whether lakes respond and can be recovered by p loading alone is an ongoing and long lasting scientific discussion see e g schindler et al 2016 and paerl et al 2016a increasing evidence of colimitation of lake systems across large spatial scales lewis et al 2020 is suggesting that both nutrients can be limiting to phytoplankton abundance and therefore can be relevant to consider when diagnosing lake eutrophication issues gplake s allows a first order estimate of chl a while allowing for colimitation as well as a single nutrient limitation offering a simple mechanistic tool to managers to determine the state of their lake given the nutrient loading see appendix 7 for a simple excel gplake s tool reducing nutrient loads either of n or of p may be achieved through a variety of management interventions and measures but their effect is strongly dependent on the shape of the response of chl a to nutrient loading schallenberg 2020 the response to a reduction in p loading may be markedly different than the response of the lake system to a reduction of n loading making the consideration of both nutrients in the management assessment relevant gplake s offers a simple yet mechanistic and theory based model that can be used to make a first order assessment of the chl a levels and the impacts of both p and n reduction efficacy all with limited data requirements it is thus a valuable tool next to the more detailed dynamical models janssen et al 2015 only by considering both nutrients and their impact on the lake phytoplankton chl a levels can water managers make cost effective decisions with maximal ecological recovery ecological recovery from anthropogenic deterioration is needed to meet the growing demands of both nature biodiversity and human well being which are dependent on these freshwater ecosystems mueller et al 2016

24352,water quality improvement to avoid excessive phytoplankton blooms often requires eutrophication management where both phosphorus p and nitrogen n play a role while empirical eutrophication studies and ecological resource competition theory both provide insight into phytoplankton abundance in response to nutrient loading they are not seamlessly linked in the current state of eutrophication research we argue that understanding species competition for multiple nutrients and light in natural phytoplankton communities is key to assessing phytoplankton abundance under changing nutrient supply here we present gplake s a mechanistic model rooted in ecological resource competition theory which has only eight parameters and can predict chlorophyll a to nutrient relationships for phytoplankton communities under n p n p colimitation and light limitation gplake s offers a simple mechanistic tool to make first estimates of chlorophyll a levels and nutrient thresholds for generic lake properties accounting for variation in n p ratio preferences of phytoplankton species this makes the model supportive of water management and policy keywords water quality management consumer resource interactions ecological modelling phosphorus limitation nitrogen limitation nutrient colimitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication is a hallmark of the anthropocene all over the world increased anthropogenic input of phosphorus p and nitrogen n to aquatic ecosystems causes water quality problems conley et al 2009 thornton et al 2013 eutrophication threatens drinking water supplies fisheries bathing water and the aesthetic value of natural and recreational water bodies paerl 1988 carpenter et al 1998 these problems are due to large amounts of phytoplankton which water quality managers generally express in terms of chlorophyll a hereafter shortened to chl a levels the excessive production of phytoplankton can outcompete plants through shading scheffer et al 1993 and cause oxygen depletion hallegraeff 2003 in addition some phytoplankton species produce toxins that are harmful to humans and animals carmichael 2001 codd et al 2005 excessive phytoplankton abundance is strongly driven by p and n loading from among other sources fertilizer and sewage water inputs into aquatic ecosystems conley et al 2009 nutrient load reduction seems the most fundamental solution to mitigate eutrophication problems jeppesen et al 2007 however careful estimation of what nutrients are limiting phytoplankton abundance and to what amount nutrient inputs should be reduced are required because management efforts are costly and will have socio economic implications janssen et al 2019 2020 specifically an important question of eutrophication management is to what extent p and n loadings should be reduced to meet water quality standards that are acceptable to society and prescribed by legislation european commission 2000 there are two scientific domains that provide insight into the excessive production of phytoplankton in response to nutrient loading empirical eutrophication studies data driven models vollenweider 1968 dillon and rigler 1974 schindler 1974 nürnberg 1984 and ecological resource competition theory tilman 1982 huisman and weissing 1994 the latter approach is usually also in different forms incorporated in process based ecosystem models janse et al 2008 janssen et al 2015 empirical eutrophication studies aim to reveal which levels of phytoplankton abundance can be expected in natural systems at a given level of nutrient loading and how acceptable levels can be ensured through water quality management one of the most widely applied eutrophication models was developed by vollenweider 1968 it is an empirical model that describes the relationship between p loading and chl a levels through statistical analysis of data from several hundred lakes worldwide later on others expanded vollenweider s seminal approach to lakes with different characteristics whilst maintaining the same model structure and goal reckhow and chapra 1983 kimmel and groeger 1984 nürnberg 1984 lijklema et al 1989 based on the seminal work of schindler schindler 1974 most of the earlier studies focus on the relationship between p and chl a dillon and rigler 1974 canfield jr et al 1981 wagner et al 2011 while later empirical models also included other factors like nitrogen as evidence arose that other limitations could be equally important rousso et al 2020 filstrup and downing 2017 on the other hand ecological resource competition theory focuses on the mechanistic underpinning of species coexistence under variable ratios of nutrient supply tilman 1982 and incident light huisman and weissing 1994 but ignores the consequences for overall chl a levels while the scientific domains of empirical eutrophication studies and ecological resource competition theory both address the relationship between nutrients light and phytoplankton abundance they are not seamlessly linked empirical eutrophication studies are generally aimed at managing excessive phytoplankton abundance in aquatic ecosystems without concern for underlying mechanisms of species competition for resources vollenweider 1968 smith and schindler 2009 moreover empirical eutrophication studies have been largely focussing on p only for a long time although later models included also other factors following discussion on e g the role of n limitation in conley et al 2009 paerl 2009 ecological resource competition theory tends to focus on the outcomes of competition in terms of species coexistence and on resource depletion rather than on the resulting abundance of the community as a whole tilman 1982 huisman and weissing 1994 and offers mechanistic insights into the role of both p and n supply ratios for phytoplankton consumer resource dynamics but it mostly stays short of making predictions of total chl a levels under natural conditions here we strive to combine the ecosystem level predictions of chl a levels under changing nutrient supply from empirical eutrophication studies with a mechanistic understanding of how the balance of resources in the form of light and multiple nutrients shapes species interactions of phytoplankton communities according to ecological resource competition theory in this paper we present the gplake s model where gplake stands for generically parameterized lake model and s stands for stoichiometry the philosophy of gplake chang et al 2019 and gplake s this study is to provide simple but mechanistic tools that can give a first estimate of chl a level and limiting factor in eutrophication management for a wide range of lake characteristics chang et al 2019 specifically we aim to develop a model that gives predictions of chl a levels in natural systems under a wide range of p and n loadings based on the first principles of ecological resource competition theory tilman 1982 whereas the original gplake model focuses on the shift from a single limiting nutrient to light limitation along a gradient of nutrient loading chang et al 2019 the expanded model gplake s presented here describes the relationship between multiple limiting nutrients and average chl a levels at equilibrium for natural communities of phytoplankton a key assumption of gplake s is that the species in natural communities of phytoplankton cover a diverse spectrum of stoichiometric demands that allows the community to adjust to a range of nutrient supply ratios to develop gplake s we address the following research questions 1 what are the first principles that determine the relationship between phytoplankton abundance and the loading of two limiting nutrients according to ecological resource competition theory 2 how can we capture the stoichiometric variability in natural communities of phytoplankton for two limiting nutrients in ecological resource competition models and what assumptions do we make in doing so 3 what types of resource limitations emerge in gplake s and what are the equilibria for chl a p and n for each type 4 how can we find generic parameters for gplake s based on field lab and model data 2 methods 2 1 theoretical background for gplake s we based our model on explicit ecological resource competition theory sensu tilman 1982 for the case of a single species with biomass concentration w1 mg m 3 growing with michaelis menten kinetics michaelis and menten 1913 cornish bowden 2015 on a single resource with concentration r1 mg m 3 we defined the model with chemostat dynamics referred to further as the 1r1w tm model where 1r1w represents the case of one species competing for one resource and tm represents a tilman type model the equations for this model are as follows 1 d r 1 d t n e t s u p p l y o f r 1 c o n s u m p t i o n o f r 1 b y w 1 d r 1 i n r 1 c r 1 w 1 p w 1 m a x r 1 r 1 h r 1 w 1 w 1 2 d w 1 d t p r o d u c t i o n o f w 1 l o s s o f w 1 p w 1 m a x r 1 r 1 h r 1 w 1 w 1 l w 1 w 1 where d day 1 is the dilution rate r1 in mg m 3 the inflowing nutrient concentration cr1 w1 mg mg 1 is the stoichiometric constant describing the amount of resource per unit of species pw1 max day 1 is the maximum species specific growth rate hr1 w1 mg m 3 is the resource concentration at which the realized specific growth equals half the maximum specific growth rate and lw1 day 1 is the specific loss rate of the species the subscript r1 w1 means that the parameters with those subscripts are for the case of one resource and one phytoplankton species for this system to be in equilibrium the mass balance equation of the resource should be fulfilled fig 1 3 d r 1 i n r 1 w 1 l w 1 c r 1 w 1 w 1 where the asterisks represent equilibrium values here the left hand term reflects the amount of resources that flow into the system minus what flows out whereas the right hand term reflects the loss rate of the resource due to the loss of the species this fundamental equation forms the basis of the nutrient limited phase of gplake chang et al 2019 an important assumption in gplake is that for realistic parameterizations of phytoplankton growing under p limitation the resource concentration at equilibrium r 1 w1 mg m 3 can be ignored because it is low when phytoplankton are in the p limited growth phase and hardly affects the equilibrium concentration of biomass w 1 mg m 3 thus we simplify the above mass balance to 4 d r 1 i n l w 1 c r 1 w 1 w 1 hence this results in an explicit formula for the equilibrium phytoplankton concentration under nutrient limitation 5 w 1 d l w 1 r 1 i n c r 1 w 1 please note that the equilibrium density of species is not only inversely proportional to the stoichiometric constant cr1 w1 but also proportional to the ratio of the dilution rate d and the specific species loss rate lw1 hence the higher the specific species loss rate of species in the system the lower the abundance of the species is under chemostat conditions with d equal to lw1 this further simplifies to 6 w 1 r 1 i n c r 1 w 1 moreover when tilman s resource competition model is expanded to two species competing for two resources 2r2w the equilibrium of the model has four possible outcomes these outcomes depend on the relative magnitudes of the single species single resource equilibrium values the supply concentrations of two resources and the ratio of the stoichiometric constants see fig 2 a for the configuration we studied here and appendix 1 for the equations of the 2r2w tm model and its graphical expressions of all four possible competition outcomes 2 2 applying competition theory to natural communities the aim of this study is to focus on natural communities of phytoplankton growing under p and n limitation this calls for a version of tilman s resource competition model with a large number of n species wi competing for two resources with liebig s law of the minimum here denoted as the 2rnw tm model the basic equations for this model are 7 d r 1 d t n e t s u p p l y o f r 1 s u m o f c o n s u m p t i o n o f r 1 b y w i d r 1 i n r 1 i c r 1 w i p w i w i 8 d r 2 d t n e t s u p p l y o f r 2 s u m o f c o n s u m p t i o n o f r 2 b y w i d r 2 i n r 2 i c r 2 w i p w i w i 9 d w i d t p r o d

equations of both resources should be fulfilled 11 d r 1 i n r 1 i l w i c r 1 w i w i 12 d r 2 i n r 2 i l w i c r 2 w i w i these equations generalize equations a1 7 and a1 8 in appendix 1 to multiple species obviously there will be constraints on the maximum and minimum values of the stoichiometric constants in the community following danger et al 2008 we referred to the species with the highest value of cr2 wi cr1 wi so the species relatively high in r2 as species wα and the species with the lowest value of cr2 wi cr1 wi so relatively high in r1 as species wβ hence for any species wi in the community it should hold that c r 2 w α c r 1 w α c r 2 w i c r 1 w i c r 2 w β c r 1 w β along comparable lines of reasoning as with the 2r2w tm model the outcome of the competition between the community of species wα wβ for two resources r1 and r2 in the 2rnw tm model is determined by the relative magnitude of the single species single resource equilibrium values r 1 wi and r 2 wi the supply concentrations of nutrients r1 in and r2 in and the stoichiometric constants cr1 wi and cr2 wi the outcome can be exclusion of all but one species or coexistence of two species see fig 2a and appendix 1 for the n 2 case to implement the 2rnw model we need to parameterize it for each of the species in the community we did so by repeatedly defining new species with intermediate nutrient requirements through geometric interpolation to exemplify this for the first step from 2 to 3 species we defined 13 c r 1 w i n t e r m e d i a t e c r 1 w α c r 1 w β 14 c r 2 w i n t e r m e d i a t e c r 2 w α c r 2 w β where wα and wβ represent the two species with the most extreme ratios of the stoichiometric constants and wintermediate represents the species that have a geometrically averaged value of consumption vector from there we proceeded to define 5 species and finally 9 species assuming that a further step to 17 species and beyond would yield little additional information to concentrate our analysis on those species that potentially can coexist pairwise with the other species in the community given that the ratio at which both resources are supplied to the system is intermediate to the requirements of that specific couple of species we made the following assumptions on the r 1 wi and r 2 wi of each species such that 15 r 2 w i r 1 w i c r 2 w i c r 1 w i and we defined that 16 r 1 w i r 2 w i c r the resulting 2r9w tm model is illustrated in fig 2b 2 3 developing a model for natural communities of phytoplankton while the above described community resource competition model is of a general nature and well rooted in ecological theory in this study we specifically apply it to natural communities of phytoplankton competing for phosphorus and nitrogen in the context of empirical eutrophication studies and call the resulting model gplake s from here on therefore we refer to r1 and r2 as p mg p m 3 and n mg p m 3 respectively in the first step towards a practical model structure we examined the required model complexity in terms of the number of species n for a 2rnw model to capture the abundance of phytoplankton in terms of chl a levels mg chl a m 3 along a nutrient supply ratio gradient nin pin from zero to infinity properly given our assumptions on the characteristics of the intermediate species to do so we compared the analytical solution of chl a levels along a nutrient supply ratio gradient for an infinite number of species with model calculations of 2 3 5 and 9 species models called the 2r2w 2r3w 2r5w and 2r9w tm models respectively in the second step we parameterized the gplake s model continuing the strategy employed in gplake chang et al 2019 we generically parameterized gplake s for reasonable ranges of stoichiometric constants of natural communities of phytoplankton on the basis of field data lab data and model data 3 results 3 1 choosing the number of species in gplake s initially we studied the impact of varying the number of species to represent a natural community of phytoplankton in gplake s given our assumptions on defining intermediate species by analysing a number of tm models of increasing species complexity specifically we carried out analyses with the 2r2w 2r3w 2r5w and 2r9w tm models along a gradient of zero to infinity of ratios of inflowing nutrient concentrations pin and nin that can be described by 17 10 p i n n i n 2000 with pin 0 and nin 0 expressed in mg p m 3 and mg n m 3 respectively the unit of the number 10 used in the gradient equation is mgn mgp 1 for the parameter settings used in this analysis see appendix 2 the resulting abundance of the species and the total calculated chl a levels for the 2r2w tm model show three zones along a nutrient supply ratio gradient a positive linear response of chl a levels to the supply of p under p limitation a plateau with a gradual replacement of species wα by species wβ and finally a negative linear response to the supply of n under n limitation fig 3 a in the 2r3w tm model this plateau is replaced by a linear increase in chl a levels as species wα is replaced by the intermediate species wμ under colimitation by p and n and a linear decrease to as species wμ is replaced by species wβ again under colimitation fig 3b further splitting the community into 5 and 9 species fig 3c and d respectively gradually refines the zone of colimitation into a convex unimodal curve with a maximum chl a level in the case of a monoculture of the species wμ with the intermediate nutrient requirements of the community we obtained the curve for n going to infinity under colimitation by calculating the abundance of the optimal species w i i e the species for which cn wi cp wi nin pin with the additional constraint that cp wα cn wα

deviations of 11 5 3 2 0 9 and 0 3 differences respectively when compared with the algebraic solution for n goes to infinity of the 2rnw tm model on the basis of these analyses we consider the 2r3w tm model with species wα wμ and wβ to be the most parsimonious and we used it to further develop gplake s 3 2 derivation of gplake s having chosen to describe the community of phytoplankton in terms of three characteristic species wα wμ and wβ we can now derive equations for the expected n p and chl a concentrations for any given combination of pin and nin here α denotes the species with the highest n p ratio while β represents the species with the lowest n p ratio and μ is the species that is intermediate in its requirements for p and n for these three species we derived equations for the equilibrium chl a p and n concentration under five types of limitation 1 a p limited system with a monoculture of wα 2 a p and n co limited system with the coexistence of wα and wμ 3 a p and n co limited system with the coexistence of wμ and wβ 4 an n limited system with a monoculture of wβ and finally 5 a light limited system with an undefined coexistence of wα wμ and wβ these equations represent five planes with pin as x coordinate nin as the y coordinate and chl a as the z coordinate projecting out of the plane fig 4 please note that in deriving these equations we made the same assumption as in gplake namely that for realistic parameterizations of phytoplankton growing under nutrient limitation the r value of the limiting nutrient can be ignored because it hardly affects the

respect to light competition of the α β and μ species in the light limited phase instead we here assume that the stoichiometric composition of the phytoplankton under light limitation complies with that of the μ species each plane represents a limitation and the realized equilibrium chl a level is determined by 39 c h l g p l a k e s min c h l p c h l p n c h l n p c h l n c h l l thus the limiting factor can be identified by checking in which planes the realized equilibrium chl a level is the minimum under certain nutrients supply once this limitation is known the matching equations for calculating p and n can be applied we call this model gplake s as it represents the stoichiometric extension of the original gplake model see table 1 for a full list of symbols of gplake s with units and descriptions 3 3 parameterization of gplake s to enable gplake s to be applied to real cases we needed a set of parameters defining stoichiometric characteristics of the extreme species α and β and of the intermediate species μ in gplake s please note that we express n p ratios throughout this study as ratios of weights as noted in the definitions for eq 17 empirically measured ranges of n p mass ratios under field conditions are given by downing and mccauley 1992 from their table we took the n p mass ratio of 20 0 for algae p deficient as an estimate of cn wα cp wα and their value of 7 0 for algae whole community as an estimate of cn wβ cp wβ for an empirically measured range of n p ratios under experimental conditions we referred to the work by klausmeier et al 2004 and took their value of 20 0 for synechococcus spp as an estimate of cn wα cn wα and their value of 3 2 for melosira binderana as an estimate of cn wβ cp wβ for model data we referred to the parameters of the bloom ii model of phytoplankton dynamics los 2009 specifically we used the values of 19 3 for aphanizomenon spp phosphorus type i e phosphorus limited type as an estimate of cn wα cp wα and their value of 4 1 for microcystis spp nitrogen type i e nitrogen limited type as an estimate of cn wβ cp wβ see table 2 for an overview of these parameters we assume that these data sources cover the stoichiometry variability of phytoplankton species in a wide range of p deficient n deficient and colimitation conditions and hence can provide a sufficiently wide range for the stoichiometric variability of a phytoplankton community under natural conditions as explained above we defined the n p mass ratio of the intermediate species wμ through geometric averaging of the n p mass ratios of the α and β species resulting in an estimate of cn wμ cp wμ 9 44 the next step in parameterizing gplake s consists of obtaining values of the stoichiometric constraints nutrient chla ratios for the α β and μ species based on the bloom ii parameter table los 2009 we chose cp wμ 0 7 g p g chl a for the intermediate species setting this value allows us to calculate the other five stoichiometric constants given the average n p mass ratio of 9 44 we got cn wμ 6 61 g n g chl a next we calculated the stoichiometric constants of the α and β species on basis of two considerations 1 the ratio of n p of the α and β species should comply with the estimate of cn wα cp wα and cn wβ cp wβ respectively and 2 the multiplication of the n and the p content of each species should obey a tradeoff comparable to the tradeoff that we assume for the r values here this tradeoff is defined as cp wα cn wα cp wμ cn wμ cp wβ cn wβ see appendix 3 for the resulting equations and table 3 for the resulting parameter values the last step in the parameterization aims at making sure that gplake s complies with gplake we did so by assuming that gplake represents the mono culture of the μ species and that in gplake the ratio of nin and pin complies with cn wμ cp wμ in that case we can make the two models compatible by first calculating the slope parameter of gplake chang et al 2019 given the depth and residence time of the lake of interest and from there calculate the ratio between the dilution rate over the community loss rate of phytoplankton with the formula d l cp wμ slopegplake moreover we can calculate the maximum level of chl a at which light limitation occurs in gplake s based on the plateau parameter of gplake chang et al 2019 calculated for the same set of lake characteristics as was used for calculating the slope parameter 3 4 outcome of gplake s we are now in the position to make predictions of chl a levels for any given combination of pin and nin based on the depth and residence time of a system of interest as an example we chose the same set of characteristics that were used in gplake chang et al 2019 this example dealt with a lake a depth of 2 meters and a residence time of 167 days the resulting values of the slope and plateau parameters of gplake were 0 689 g chl a g p 1 and 97 0 mg chl a m 3 respectively table 3 please note that these values of slopegplake and plateaugplake were obtained by calculating pin in mg p m 3 from nutrient loading in mg p m 2 year 1 using vollenweider s method for normalization by water depth and residence time see eq 9 and the explanation thereof in chang et al 2019 from there the ratio between the dilution rate and the community loss rate of phytoplankton was calculated by d l cp wμ slopegplake this resulted in a dimensionless value of 0 483 for d l with this we had values for all parameters needed to calculate the five planes of gplake s each of them representing a specific type of limitation according to the equations for chl a p chl a pn chl a np chl a n and chl a l as a function of pin and nin presented above and as a final step we calculated the predicted value of chl a gplake s by taking the minimum of these values and in doing so identified which factor actually limits phytoplankton abundance this knowledge then allowed us to calculate p gplake s and n gplake s by using the equations that match the corresponding limitation planes fig 4 we present the outcomes of gplake s in this study for a range of inflowing p concentrations of 0 pin 250 mg p m 3 and on the basis of the average ratio between p and n in our modelled community of phytoplankton for a range of inflowing n concentrations of 0 nin 2500 mg n m 3 the resulting values of chl a gplake s are presented in fig 4 by the intensity of the green colour this figure shows which type of limitation occurred for a given combination of pin and nin p limitation pn colimitation np colimitation n limitation or light limitation the equations for the lines that specify the levels of inflowing nutrients where switches between types of limitations occur are shown in appendix 4 3 5 applying gplake s along a nutrient supply ratio gradient finally we compared our prediction of chl a by gplake s along a nutrient supply ratio gradient dashed line in fig 4 against the predicted chl a levels for each of the phytoplankton species and types that are covered by the bloom ii model los 2009 and against the prediction made by gplake chang et al 2019 to start with the latter comparison gplake focusses on p limitation only while assuming that the supply of n varies accordingly to meet the stoichiometric demands of those phytoplankton species that are present in the system this means that gplake deals with those combinations of supply ratios that fall on the line that separates the pn co limited from the np co limited planes of gplake s as depicted in fig 4 and this also means that gplake only makes predictions for a single line that is a single value of nutrient supply ratio on the nutrient supply ratio gradient depicted in fig 4 when compared with the predictions for phytoplankton species and types that are covered by the bloom ii parameter table see appendix 5 two things catch the eye following the logic of our community expansion of the tilman model for resource competition each of these species is plotted along the nutrient supply ratio gradient according to its stoichiometric demands the range in these demands closely matches the zones of pn and np colimitation this stems from the fact that the range of stoichiometric demands of the species and types in bloom ii coincides well with the combined range based on field lab and model data presented in table 2 with respect to chl a predictions the gplake s prediction matches the average of the wide variation in predictions per species and types from the bloom ii parameter table fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 towards a generically parameterized model of lake eutrophication that takes stoichiometric ratios and constraints into account in developing gplake s we have taken an important step forward in understanding and predicting the impacts of eutrophication by multiple potentially limiting nutrients on phytoplankton abundance in natural systems our aims with the model are to provide water quality managers with a model that 1 can be used for predicting chl a levels considering combinations of p and n loadings 2 can identify the limiting factor i e phosphorus nitrogen both phosphorus and nitrogen or light of the target ecosystem 3 can be parameterized with data sources from lab field and model studies and 4 is easy to use and requires a limited number of inputs that are available to water quality managers while eutrophication is often considered as a singular pressure the body of evidence of it being two conjoint pressures in freshwater systems namely p and n pollution has become undeniable paerl et al 2016b lewis et al 2020 while ecological resource competition theory has long delved into such concepts the link towards chl a prediction using these models has remained largely absent gplake s fills this gap building on ecological resource competition theory to deliver a minimalist mechanistic model for predicting chl a under scenarios of two competing nutrients our results of the gplake s model show it to be capable of distinguishing between different types of limitation n p n p and light limitation commonly described in real world lake systems see e g lewis et al 2020 while predicting the resulting chl a as a measure of phytoplankton abundance 4 2 design considerations underlying gplake s the basis of the gplake s model is firmly rooted in ecological resource competition theory sensu tilman 1982 and huisman and weissing 1995 the basis of stoichiometric limits i e the α and β species is well accepted in the field of ecological stoichiometry and has a clear empirical basis klausmeier et al 2004 danger et al 2008 teurlincx et al 2017 the selection of the optimal number of species to describe the nutrient to chl a relationship fig 3 may be questioned however the concept of productivity and its link to biodiversity is often debated and examined in the context of biodiversity ecosystem functioning bef literature striebel et al 2009 2012 jochum et al 2020 within the bef framework small increases in ecosystem functioning e g resource use or other processes can often be attributed to increasing biodiversity leading to the notion that the inclusion of more species in a model is per definition meaningful our goal however is somewhat different in that we are looking for first order estimates of phytoplankton abundance in the form of chl a levels rather than to try to answer the question regarding biodiversity and productivity per se this has led us to choose what is model wise the least complex solution with a reasonable fit we restrict ourselves to the questions posed in eutrophication management revolve around the amount of chl a produced nonetheless it is important to note that the inclusion of some level of biodiversity i e three species in the model is necessary to make sound predictions of chl a nutrient relations given our assumption of the characteristics of those species such interest for biodiversity in simple models has gained increasing traction in ecological consumer resource based bef modelling danger et al 2008 parain et al 2019 here we show that biodiversity in terms of functional algal groups is also important when using ecological consumer resource theory to predict chl a as a measure of phytoplankton abundance 4 3 the empirical basis of gplake s a total of eight parameters are required to apply gplake s the six stoichiometric constants for p and n of the three species α β and μ the ratio between the dilution rate and the phytoplankton community loss rate and finally the upper limit of chl a due to light limitation these latter two parameters are derived from the slope and plateau of gplake to calculate the slope and plateau of gplake we need the c1 and c2 parameters of that model and the depth and residence time of the lake under consideration the resulting parameters of gplake s for the default setting of gplake for a lake with a depth of 2 meters and a residence time 167 days are given in table 3 and the equations to calculate them in appendix 3 following the design principles of gplake we collected information about the stoichiometric variability in terms of maximum and minimum n p ratios based on field lab and model data n p ratios of phytoplankton are widely published hillebrand et al 2013 de senerpont domis et al 2014 tanioka and matsumoto 2020 and have historically been used to define the limiting nutrient in lake ecosystems see e g faafeng and hessen 1993 less common is information about the p chl a and n chl a ratios needed to parameterize the six stoichiometric constants of gplake s of the three data sources used for the n p ratios only the bloom ii parameter table also specifies the p chl a and n chl a ratios using carbon content as an intermediate step this is not a coincidence as the approach taken in the bloom ii model overlaps with that of gplake s in the sense that both models recognize the importance of algal n p ratios in predicting algal abundances and take into account that a semi continuous range of those ratios is present in natural algal communities for some of the basic design principles of bloom ii and how these relate to the tilman model of ecological resource competition see appendix 6 because the parameter value of stoichiometric constant is key to gplake s we chose to estimate the stoichiometric constant of the intermediate species μ for phosphorus cp wμ from the bloom ii parameter table and calculated the other five stoichiometric constants based on that value using the equations provided in appendix 3 one may question this approach for two reasons what are the consequences of starting with the parametrization with cp wμ instead of one of the other five stoichiometric constants and in what way are the predicted chl a levels dependent on the specific value we chose acknowledging that we used a single data source here in contradiction with the gplake philosophy to combine the strength of field lab and model data in finding generic parameters the simple but also surprising answer to these questions is that neither the order of parametrization nor even the value we chose for cp wμ has an impact on the chl a levels predicted by gplake s this insensitivity exists because for reasons of consistency of gplake s with gplake we estimated the ratio of the dilution rate over the phytoplankton community loss rate d l gplake s by multiplying the slope parameter obtained from gplake by the estimated value of cp wμ according to the formula d l cp wμ slopegplake any change in our estimate of cp wμ will therefore result in a proportional change in d l gplake s and in each of the equations of gplake s whether it be the equations within the planes where the chl a levels are predicted as functions of pin and nin under the five different limitations or it be in the equations of the lines that specify the relation between pin and nin at which there is a switch in the type of limitation these proportional changes in each of the six stoichiometric constants and d l gplake s will cancel out this leaves the predicted chl a levels and the type of limitation that occurs unchanged this brings us to the important conclusion that gplake s inherits its estimates for the intermediate species that thrive under intermediate n p ratios from the elaborate parametrization of gplake based on the vollenweider data the selected lab experiments and the runs with pclake see chang et al 2019 this also leads to the conclusion that the only additional empirical data needed to parameterize gplake s given a parameterized gplake are the n p ratios of the α and β species 4 4 omitting light nutrient colimitation in gplake s in the development of gplake s we expanded the contrast between nutrient and light limitation that is key to gplake to the concept of nutrient colimitation in combination with the choice to represent stoichiometric variability in natural communities of phytoplankton in three species α β and μ that represent a high low and intermediate n p ratio this results in five possible types of limitation as depicted in fig 4 of course these limitations are only a subset of the factors that might limit phytoplankton abundance under natural conditions prominent among these factors is the colimitation of light and nutrients brauer et al 2012 this occurs when in the light gradient over depth phytoplankton is nutrient limited near the surface but light limited near the sediment while addressing such colimitation would fit in our philosophy of gplake s with respect to ecological complexity we omitted it for the practical reason that we do not know of analytical expressions for the equilibrium values of chl a under such colimitation adding light nutrient limitation would therefore prohibit us from developing a simple tool for applying gplake s in water quality management e g it would cause technical complexity to the use of gplake s that we considered undesirable as a result the predictions of gplake s for pin and nin values for which light nutrient colimitation would likely occur will be overestimated being necessarily an overestimate the gplake s chl a should therefore be seen as a worst case scenario under those circumstances in field fig 6 4 5 relevance for water management and policy freshwater eutrophication management and policy have a long history of focussing on the reduction of phosphorus inputs to lakes to attempt to revert the damage to the ecosystem by anthropogenic pollution see e g carpenter et al 1999 whether lakes respond and can be recovered by p loading alone is an ongoing and long lasting scientific discussion see e g schindler et al 2016 and paerl et al 2016a increasing evidence of colimitation of lake systems across large spatial scales lewis et al 2020 is suggesting that both nutrients can be limiting to phytoplankton abundance and therefore can be relevant to consider when diagnosing lake eutrophication issues gplake s allows a first order estimate of chl a while allowing for colimitation as well as a single nutrient limitation offering a simple mechanistic tool to managers to determine the state of their lake given the nutrient loading see appendix 7 for a simple excel gplake s tool reducing nutrient loads either of n or of p may be achieved through a variety of management interventions and measures but their effect is strongly dependent on the shape of the response of chl a to nutrient loading schallenberg 2020 the response to a reduction in p loading may be markedly different than the response of the lake system to a reduction of n loading making the consideration of both nutrients in the management assessment relevant gplake s offers a simple yet mechanistic and theory based model that can be used to make a first order assessment of the chl a levels and the impacts of both p and n reduction efficacy all with limited data requirements it is thus a valuable tool next to the more detailed dynamical models janssen et al 2015 only by considering both nutrients and their impact on the lake phytoplankton chl a levels can water managers make cost effective decisions with maximal ecological recovery ecological recovery from anthropogenic deterioration is needed to meet the growing demands of both nature biodiversity and human well being which are dependent on these freshwater ecosystems mueller et al 2016

24353,aquaculture can play a key role in providing sustainable and low cost protein sources with the potential to help particularly the socially and economically vulnerable population although many coastal populations already complement their diet by extracting wild brown mussels perna perna mytilidae from the environment an explicit assessment for mussel growth potential along the brazilian coast has been conspicuously lacking we provide a large scale assessment for prospecting and developing mussel culture by applying a dynamic energy budget deb model coupled with remote sensing we estimated deb parameters for the p perna brazilian population and used satellite derived yearly data was used as forcing variables containing information of chlorophyll a concentration as a proxy for food concentration sea surface temperature to modulate metabolic performance and particulate organic carbon discounted the contribution of chlorophyll a to take into account the negative effect of particles in the mussel ingestion rates we then simulated mussel growth along a large region of the brazilian coast and obtained the time it takes for the mussel to reach a 5 cm market relevant length within each pixel as a means to visualize mapped mussel growth potential indicating the time it takes to reach commercial length our results highlight the regions where mussel growth can be relevant for supporting subsistence livelihoods and also for securing income for local communities by performing economic activities as many of the identified regions do not yet have active mussel culture sites we also show that mussels can be used for ecosystem services in regions where farming for human consumption is not advisable our study provides further evidence that bioenergetic models coupled

gentry et al 2017 understanding the dynamics of mussel growth through spatial gradients can provide data that support such economic activities helping not only improve food security but could also provide access to better livelihoods though modeling techniques to assess mussel growth over large areas are available such an assessment for mussel growth potential is lacking in brazil we assessed the spatial distribution of growth potential for the brown mussel perna perna by applying a dynamic energy budget model coupled with remote sensing over a large latitudinal gradient in the southwestern atlantic along the brazilian coast satellite derived chlorophyll a proxy for food availability particulate organic carbon representing the negative effects of suspended particles in mussel feeding and temperature for metabolic rate corrections data was used as forcing variables in a deb model calibrated with the local population p perna parameters we then simulated the mussel

quantitatively understanding energy and mass flows associated with the individual level metabolism of an organism this theory can be used to study a wide range of life history dynamics including growth in which different species can be represented by adjusting the appropriate parameter values within the same model structure we used a standard deb model the most straightforward form that is expressed by deb theory with minor adaptations for feeding dynamics described below the organism state and its environment are combined through the deb model in order to build predictions for the farming time needed by the brown mussel to reach a desired length detailed explanations of this model structure are abundantly available throughout the literature jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 sousa

that takes into account a negative effect of non food particles on feeding processes kooijman 2006 marn et al 2020 we assumed food availability throughout the simulation time defined in the simulation section to be constant in order to capture the overall growth potential within each location growth dynamics of the standard deb model for constant food concentrations are represented in equations 4 5

estimates performed by tagliarolo et al 2016 readily available at the add my pet database marques et al 2018 an open repository containing parameter estimates for over 3250 different metazoan species at the present moment to take into account the local properties of deb parameters within the standard deb model framework we estimated parameters for a standard deb model representing the brazilian p perna population we stress that although both models south african and brazilian populations describe the same species the respective parameters are not directly comparable as the estimates available in the add my pet database considers an additional development stage with growth acceleration between birth and metamorphosis abj deb model while the model presented in this work focused on a straightforward assessment for development after maturity and settlement assumes isomorphic growth standard deb model parameters were estimated using the debtool for matlab lika et al 2011 using the covariation method in which the estimates are performed simultaneously minimizing the distance between empirical datasets and model predictions with a nelder mead simplex algorithm this was done using four datasets m b henriques and casarini 2009 marenzi and branco 2005 marques et al 1991 mugabe and ferreira 2010 with information about p perna growth in field experiments conducted along the study region model parameter values and details are available in the supplementary material environmental data used to calibrate our model was obtained from the satellite derived values of chlorophyll a sea surface temperature and particulate organic carbon in the same year and pixel an alias for location where the specific field experiments were conducted for experiments conducted in years outside of our dataset we used the mean values of all the years for that pixel the carbon to chlorophyll ratio for the phytoplankton community within each pixel from equation 1 was assumed to be constant c c h l 52 as this value represents a realistic approximation for estuarine phytoplankton in the study region marone et al 2005 the resulting parameters were then used to simulate growth curves using equation 8 such that l t l l 0 exp r b t expressing body length as a function of time this allowed us to assess the accuracy of the parameters obtained by the estimation process with errors between experimental data and the simulations were then evaluated using two different metrics root mean squared error rmse and explained variance ev 2 5 simulation equations 1 to 7 were then numerically solved in order to obtain growth coefficient r b and ultimate length l values in each available year and pixel within the study region using the forcing variables described above this allowed us to obtain mapped information for r b and l with yearly changes in growth performance throughout the region since our interest is also to identify the potential of mussel growth for human consumption within a particular area we solved equation 8 for the time it takes to reach the smallest marketable length of five centimeters for p perna found in the literature henriques et al 2018 to represent a realistic value for the mean starting size l 0 in which mussels begin their growth phase in the aquaculture sites an initial size of three centimeters was used suplicy 2018b this approach allowed us to have a unified spatial output for the mussel growth potential represented as a function of time to marketable length for all 19 years available in the data set the model was programmed to output empty values unless the pixel yielded an ultimate length l larger than the marketable size and growth coefficient r b values that allowed a marketable length to be reached within 12 months this allowed us to assess if each site has the potential to achieve yearly yields of mussel production we then obtained the final maps with yearly values for the time to reach marketable size throughout the study region lastly we visualized the time to marketable length in the locations corresponding to the selected regions pointed out in fig 1 in all years from 2002 to 2020 by doing so we identified if each region has the potential for mussel production and how consistent mussel growth was throughout the years 3 results 3 1 parameter estimation growth curves simulated with the estimated deb parameters for the brazilian brown mussel population and their comparison to experimental data are shown in fig 2 regions corresponding to sc 1 and sp 2 show rmse values close to 0 6 while sp 3 yielded the smallest values of 0 39 the sc 2 region showed the largest rmse with a value of 1 77 while ev values for all sites remained close to 0 9 indicating a reasonable model fit 3 2 simulation the first step of our simulation led to the production of yearly maps with values of growth coefficients and ultimate length along the study region in fig 3 we show the mean value of these maps throughout the years of our time scale fig 3 a represents spatial changes in growth coefficient values that relate strongly with the 200 m bathymetry line as well as the bay close to rj 1 while lower values seem to occur within our study region towards the south of sc 1 fig 3 b shows the ultimate length that brown mussels are able to reach within each pixel higher values are concentrated within the 200 m bathymetry line yet higher ultimate lengths occur only in areas with proximity to the coast by using the growth coefficient and ultimate length pixel values in equation 8 we obtained yearly maps representing the time to reach a marketable mussel size of five centimeters we show the median values of these yearly plots in fig 4 where dark areas represent the areas where mussels do not reach this size threshold within a period of 12 months lower times to reach a marketable size are colored from red lowest to yellow highest the results show that mussels grow faster in areas with continental water output and restricted circulation dynamics yet the possibility of yearly mussel production was a common occurrence across the whole study region with the exception of rj 1 and most of the surrounding region close to sp 3 results show potential in regions closer to the coast but no potential was identified beyond coastal areas fig 5 represents the yearly values for the time to reach a marketable length in all of our selected regions we identified farming potential in all locations with the exception of sp 3 and rj 1 with the latter having only one year containing predictions where mussels reach a marketable length within a period of 12 months rj 2 showed the most consistent and the shortest overall time to reach marketable length followed by rj 3 sc 1 and pr 1 the remaining regions show a higher variability yet mussels were able to reach market lengths within the simulated period 4 discussion there are possibilities that go beyond that of economic relevance for understanding spatialized metabolic dynamics from an ecosystem perspective our results provide a bottom up regional assessment without the influence of environmental interactions such as density dependence or predation showing a spatial layer for the potential of metabolic performance in specific real world conditions this presents a valuable unbiased base layer for modeling other interactions and helps understand the mechanisms of energy distribution in ecosystems as field data is seldom free from other higher level environmental drivers like ecological interactions the model manages to capture a general growth trend for p perna throughout the southeastern brazilian coast values of the rmse are expressed in centimeters and the errors obtained were all smaller than one centimeter with the exception of sc 2 fig 2 this result can be expected mostly due to the spatial heterogeneity of the large scale assessment at hand a plausible explanation is a variation in phytoplankton community composition that wasn t taken into account in this study and directly affects the carbon to chlorophyll ratio c c h l which was considered constant in our simulations moreover performing a detailed large scale assessment of this ratio could prove itself costly and resource intensive and is beyond the scope of this project by calibrating the model using in situ data that already takes into account the regional p perna feeding dynamics we managed to capture the overall growth dynamics for mussel culture sites along a large area of the brazilian coast the growth coefficient within deb theory is a value proportional to a temperature correction factor when used in simulations equations 7 and 8 this means that it is strongly dependent on the sea surface temperature thus showing higher values in warmer waters fig 3 high growth coefficient values near rj 1 can be explained by the presence of a nuclear facility in the region with reported impacts of runoff water on the local biodiversity mayer pinto et al 2012 teixeira et al 2009 the outer region of the 200 m bathymetry line also demonstrated higher values possibly due to the presence of the tropical waters with the surface layer for the brazil current bringing warmer water to the limits of the continental shelf yet this region goes beyond the depth established by gentry et al 2017 for offshore aquaculture ultimate lengths in deb theory on the other hand are strongly affected by food availability since chlorophyll a was used as our proxy for food availability coastal regions fertilized by continental water outputs strongly influence the surrounding areas yielding higher values yet taking into account the negative effect of non food particles in the water allowed us to also identify larger ultimate lengths in areas with fewer suspended particles and reasonable chlorophyll concentrations such as sc 1 and sc 2 regions known for their mussel culture activities fig 4 shows that there is relevant potential for mussel culture throughout most of the study region and fig 5 shows the temporal dynamics of this potential for brazilian mussel farming in the selected regions the 4 km resolution of each pixel in our simulation is enough to identify sites within the scale of our study region but to pinpoint exact sites where production is relevant one must take into account more specific dynamics such as the geomorphological aspects and specific conditions for each site vertical variation of the forcing variables used in this study was also not considered while using satelite images to perform growth assessments may be practical variables that represent temperature primary production and suspended particles may vary significantly with depth this is true especially for coastal regions where the influence of continental water and dynamics related to vertical mixing can be factors relevant for mussel culture this also means that regions that we did not identify as relevant for mussel culture can potentially have productive sites within their respective pixels that we were not able to detect but regions that we did identify certainly house a potential to develop mussel farming activities this remains relevant especially for regions sp 3 and rj 1 which did not show any significant production potential for mussel farming in our simulations however they could still house specific locations with farming potential that was not detected in this study all the other studied regions showed potential for yearly yields in mussel production with the highest being rj 2 this region is known as a good location for bivalve farming and focuses its economic activities on more lucrative species such as scallops we did not identify any favorable conditions for offshore mussel culture though we identified high growth coefficients in regions close to the 200 meter depth line the ultimate lengths that those regions are able to provide yield mussels that are too small for any commercial purposes we also obtained high growth potential in regions heavily impacted by industrial activity impacted regions such as pr 1 can benefit from mussel farming as it provides other relevant ecosystem services van der schatte olivier et al 2018 such as bio remediation and water clarification in this case farming can be used to control eutrophication and develop healthier environments kotta et al 2020 other than mussel production for food consumption taking the ecosystem services provided by the proposed activity into account when designing and planning a site can ensure more efficient management in these regions building a path towards a more sustainable and efficient land or water use gentry et al 2020 we pointed out several areas where mussel culture can be effectively performed these assessments can be helpful when using techniques like the spatial multi criteria evaluation as used by brigolin et al 2017 as a criterion for identifying suitable aquaculture sites areas with good environmental conditions can be used as a base for regional social economic development initiatives as proposed by carranza et al 2009 for south american mussels in areas like the sp 1 and sp 2 there are no large scale mussel farming activities suplicy 2018a shows that mussel farming can provide high quality food for the growing societal demand more sustainably even suggesting the use of gis for detecting suitable aquaculture sites the model can also be useful in finding a balance between production costs and production yield in different environmental scenarios as done by timmermann et al 2014 understanding the key components of biological communities is relevant in developing effective ecosystem based management actions and also serves as a complement for marine spatial planning crowder and norse 2008 especially in face of high demands for innovative solutions to counter increasing food insecurity our study provides further evidence that bioenergetic models can be coupled with remote sensing offering a pragmatic path to assess conditions for bivalve growth potential along spatial gradients these findings can be used in the context of developing policies for regional development helping the coastal communities obtain important and accessible food sources and also providing knowledge about areas where the brown mussel ecosystem services can be effectively implemented the model allows discussions for spatial management to take place in a broader perspective as using spatialized growth projections can help multiple sectors improve decision making spatial management and simulate possible scenarios in a changing environment authors contributions t t y and f s v conceived the project carried out the

coastal populations already complement their diet by extracting wild brown mussels perna perna mytilidae from the environment an explicit assessment for mussel growth potential along the brazilian coast has been conspicuously lacking we provide a large scale assessment for prospecting and developing mussel culture by applying a dynamic energy budget deb model coupled with remote sensing we estimated deb parameters for the p perna brazilian population and used satellite derived yearly data was used as forcing variables containing information of chlorophyll a concentration as a proxy for food concentration sea surface temperature to modulate metabolic performance and particulate organic carbon discounted the contribution of chlorophyll a to take into account the negative effect of particles in the mussel ingestion rates we then simulated mussel growth along a large region of the brazilian coast and obtained the time it takes for the mussel to reach a 5 cm market relevant length within each pixel as a means to visualize mapped mussel growth potential indicating the time it takes to reach commercial length our results highlight the regions where mussel growth can be relevant for supporting subsistence livelihoods and also for securing income for local communities by performing economic activities as many of the identified regions do not yet have active mussel culture sites we also show that mussels can be used for ecosystem services in regions where farming for human consumption is not advisable our study provides further evidence that bioenergetic models coupled with remote sensing allow for a pragmatic and cost effective path to assess growth performance along large regions with implications for developmental policy and spatial planning graphical abstract

services ranging from eutrophication control kotta et al 2020 transferring energy from the pelagic to the benthic food chains to adding complexity to ecological systems with their shell structures borthagaray and carranza 2007 burlakova et al 2012 yurek et al 2021 in brazilian coastal environments the brown mussel perna perna mytilidae is an important member of the native biodiversity and the only farmed mytilid species in the country lopes and fonseca 2008 with many coastal populations already complementing their diet by extracting wild brown mussels from the environment bio energetic models can provide a pragmatic path to assess mussel growth across environmental gradients by coupling metabolic theories such as dynamic energy budget deb with spatialized environmental variables one can obtain information about how the metabolic properties of an organism lead to different performance over heterogeneous environments lavaud et al 2021 the deb model has been used to predict a variety of characteristics from different organisms such as species ranges population dynamics and life history traits kearney 2012 kooijman et al 2021 maury and poggiale 2013 as well as the effects of climate change species distribution and habitat quality lavaud et al 2021 monaco et al 2019 teal et al 2012 spatialized deb models have also been used to understand the potential of economic activities such as predicting effective aquaculture sites and their carrying capacities cheng et al 2018 filgueira et al 2021 these models show effectiveness and versatility when used to identify a region s natural predisposition to perform activities such as aquaculture minimizing the resources needed to achieve sustainable production yields filgueira et al 2019 following the sustainable development goals and fao s blue growth initiative fao 2016 mussel farming can play an important role in providing accessible protein sources and improving food security especially in developing countries godfray et al 2010 suplicy 2018a brazil faces a serious food security crisis driven by a recent sharp increase in food prices there have been reports of growing food insecurity for the economically vulnerable population de carvalho et al 2021 with worsening effects driven by the covid 19 pandemic manfrinato et al 2021 many coastal populations are particularly vulnerable in these situations due to higher population density and social displacement during regional development commonly leading to the loss of livelihoods and cultural roots hanazaki et al 2013 ogello and munguti 2016 mussel farming can be a tool to improve food security suplicy 2018a and activities such as offshore aquaculture have been described to be a relevant pathway for sustainable protein production gentry et al 2017 understanding the dynamics of mussel growth through spatial gradients can provide data that support such economic activities helping not only improve food security but could also provide access to better livelihoods though modeling techniques to assess mussel growth over large areas are available such an assessment for mussel growth potential is lacking in brazil we assessed the spatial distribution of growth potential for the brown mussel perna perna by applying a dynamic energy budget model coupled with remote sensing over a large latitudinal gradient in the southwestern atlantic along the brazilian coast satellite derived chlorophyll a proxy for food availability particulate organic carbon representing the negative effects of suspended particles in mussel feeding and temperature for metabolic rate corrections data was used as forcing variables in a deb model calibrated with the local population p perna parameters we then simulated the mussel growth potential along a large region along the brazilian coast and evaluated specific sites in their predisposition for mussel production 2 methods 2 1 study region this study focused on a polygon latitude 20 9 s to 29 9 s longitude 51 6 w to 39 9 w representing the proximity of the coastal regions along the southeastern brazilian shelf this choice of the region makes it easier to understand

quantitatively understanding energy and mass flows associated with the individual level metabolism of an organism this theory can be used to study a wide range of life history dynamics including growth in which different species can be represented by adjusting the appropriate parameter values within the same model structure we used a standard deb model the most straightforward form that is expressed by deb theory with minor adaptations for feeding dynamics described below the organism state and its environment are combined through the deb model in order to build predictions for the farming time needed by the brown mussel to reach a desired length detailed explanations of this model structure are abundantly available throughout the literature jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 sousa et al 2010 and equations used in our simulation are summarized in table 1 equations 1 2 and 3 simulate a holling type ii functional response holling 1959 with a dynamic half saturation coefficient that takes into account a negative effect of non food particles on feeding processes kooijman 2006 marn et al 2020 we assumed food availability throughout the simulation time defined in the simulation section to be constant in order to capture the overall growth potential within each location growth dynamics of the standard deb model for constant food concentrations are represented in equations 4 5 6 and 8 with the last being an inverted pütter von bertalanffy like growth equation kearney 2021 written in terms of time to reach the desired length l temperature dependence on physiological rates equation 7 was obtained by applying an arrhenius like temperature correction factor similar to that derived from schoolfield et al 1981 used in deb theory to simulate a metabolic performance curve at different temperatures 2 3 forcing variables we used three forcing variables in our simulation sea surface temperature representing temperature dependent changes in metabolic rates chlorophyll a as a proxy for phytoplankton concentration and thus food availability and particulate organic carbon concentration discounted the phytoplankton contribution in terms of carbon as shown in equation 1 representing the negative effects of the suspended particles in the water column on mussel feeding rates kooijman 2006 these variables were obtained in the form of satellite images with a 4 km spatial resolution and one year temporal resolution level 3 mapped rasters were extracted from the ocean color database nasa ocean biology processing group 2017a nasa ocean biology processing group 2017b nasa jpl 2020 for the years 2002 to 2020 2 4 parameter estimation though deb parameters are species specific different populations distributed over large spatial scales can differ in growth dynamics for several reasons such as phenotypic plasticity or unaccounted environmental conditions monaco et al 2019 p perna parameter estimates exist in the literature for the south african population with estimates performed by tagliarolo et al 2016 readily available at the add my pet database marques et al 2018 an open repository containing parameter estimates for over 3250 different metazoan species at the present moment to take into account the local properties of deb parameters within the standard deb model framework we estimated parameters for a standard deb model representing the brazilian p perna population we stress that although both models south african and brazilian populations describe the same species the respective parameters are not directly comparable as the estimates available in the add my pet database considers an additional development stage with growth acceleration between birth and metamorphosis abj deb model while the model presented in this work focused on a straightforward assessment for development after maturity and settlement assumes isomorphic growth standard deb model parameters were estimated using the debtool for matlab lika et al 2011 using the covariation method in which the estimates are performed simultaneously minimizing the distance between empirical datasets and model predictions with a nelder mead simplex algorithm this was done using four datasets m b henriques and casarini 2009 marenzi and branco 2005 marques et al 1991 mugabe and ferreira 2010 with information about p perna growth in field experiments conducted along the study region model parameter values and details are available in the supplementary material environmental data used to calibrate our model was obtained from the satellite derived values of chlorophyll a sea surface temperature and particulate organic carbon in the same year and pixel an alias for location where the specific field experiments were conducted for experiments conducted in years outside of our dataset we used the mean values of all the years for that pixel the carbon to chlorophyll ratio for the phytoplankton community within each pixel from equation 1 was assumed to be constant c c h l 52 as this value represents a realistic approximation for estuarine phytoplankton in the study region marone et al 2005 the resulting parameters were then used to simulate growth curves using equation 8 such that l t l l 0 exp r b t expressing body length as a function of time this allowed us to assess the accuracy of the parameters obtained by the estimation process with errors between experimental data and the simulations were then evaluated using two different metrics root mean squared error rmse and explained variance ev 2 5 simulation equations 1 to 7 were then numerically solved in order to obtain growth coefficient r b and ultimate length l values in each available year and pixel within the study region using the forcing variables described above this allowed us to obtain mapped information for r b and l with yearly changes in growth performance throughout the region since our interest is also to identify the potential of mussel growth for human consumption within a particular area we solved equation 8 for the time it takes to reach the smallest marketable length of five centimeters for p perna found in the literature henriques et al 2018 to represent a realistic value for the mean starting size l 0 in which mussels begin their growth phase in the aquaculture sites an initial size of three centimeters was used suplicy 2018b this approach allowed us to have a unified spatial output for the mussel growth potential represented as a function of time to marketable length for all 19 years available in the data set the model was programmed to output empty values unless the pixel yielded an ultimate length l larger than the marketable size and growth coefficient r b values that allowed a marketable length to be reached within 12 months this allowed us to assess if each site has the potential to achieve yearly yields of mussel production we then obtained the final maps with yearly values for the time to reach marketable size throughout the study region lastly we visualized the time to marketable length in the locations corresponding to the selected regions pointed out in fig 1 in all years from 2002 to 2020 by doing so we identified if each region has the potential for mussel production and how consistent mussel growth was throughout the years 3 results 3 1 parameter estimation growth curves simulated with the estimated deb parameters for the brazilian brown mussel population and their comparison to experimental data are shown in fig 2 regions corresponding to sc 1 and sp 2 show rmse values close to 0 6 while sp 3 yielded the smallest values of 0 39 the sc 2 region showed the largest rmse with a value of 1 77 while ev values for all sites remained close to 0 9 indicating a reasonable model fit 3 2 simulation the first step of our simulation led to the production of yearly maps with values of growth coefficients and ultimate length along the study region in fig 3 we show the mean value of these maps throughout the years of our time scale fig 3 a represents spatial changes in growth coefficient values that relate strongly with the 200 m bathymetry line as well as the bay close to rj 1 while lower values seem to occur within our study region towards the south of sc 1 fig 3 b shows the ultimate length that brown mussels are able to reach within each pixel higher values are concentrated within the 200 m bathymetry line yet higher ultimate lengths occur only in areas with proximity to the coast by using the growth coefficient and ultimate length pixel values in equation 8 we obtained yearly maps representing the time to reach a marketable mussel size of five centimeters we show the median values of these yearly plots in fig 4 where dark areas represent the areas where mussels do not reach this size threshold within a period of 12 months lower times to reach a marketable size are colored from red lowest to yellow highest the results show that mussels grow faster in areas with continental water output and restricted circulation dynamics yet the possibility of yearly mussel production was a common occurrence across the whole study region with the exception of rj 1 and most of the surrounding region close to sp 3 results show potential in regions closer to the coast but no potential was identified beyond coastal areas fig 5 represents the yearly values for the time to reach a marketable length in all of our selected regions we identified farming potential in all locations with the exception of sp 3 and rj 1 with the latter having only one year containing predictions where mussels reach a marketable length within a period of 12 months rj 2 showed the most consistent and the shortest overall time to reach marketable length followed by rj 3 sc 1 and pr 1 the remaining regions show a higher variability yet mussels were able to reach market lengths within the simulated period 4 discussion there are possibilities that go beyond that of economic relevance for understanding spatialized metabolic dynamics from an ecosystem perspective our results provide a bottom up regional assessment without the influence of environmental interactions such as density dependence or predation showing a spatial layer for the potential of metabolic performance in specific real world conditions this presents a valuable unbiased base layer for modeling other interactions and helps understand the mechanisms of energy distribution in ecosystems as field data is seldom free from other higher level environmental drivers like ecological interactions the model manages to capture a general growth trend for p perna throughout the southeastern brazilian coast values of the rmse are expressed in centimeters and the errors obtained were all smaller than one centimeter with the exception of sc 2 fig 2 this result can be expected mostly due to the spatial heterogeneity of the large scale assessment at hand a plausible explanation is a variation in phytoplankton community composition that wasn t taken into account in this study and directly affects the carbon to chlorophyll ratio c c h l which was considered constant in our simulations moreover performing a detailed large scale assessment of this ratio could prove itself costly and resource intensive and is beyond the scope of this project by calibrating the model using in situ data that already takes into account the regional p perna feeding dynamics we managed to capture the overall growth dynamics for mussel culture sites along a large area of the brazilian coast the growth coefficient within deb theory is a value proportional to a temperature correction factor when used in simulations equations 7 and 8 this means that it is strongly dependent on the sea surface temperature thus showing higher values in warmer waters fig 3 high growth coefficient values near rj 1 can be explained by the presence of a nuclear facility in the region with reported impacts of runoff water on the local biodiversity mayer pinto et al 2012 teixeira et al 2009 the outer region of the 200 m bathymetry line also demonstrated higher values possibly due to the presence of the tropical waters with the surface layer for the brazil current bringing warmer water to the limits of the continental shelf yet this region goes beyond the depth established by gentry et al 2017 for offshore aquaculture ultimate lengths in deb theory on the other hand are strongly affected by food availability since chlorophyll a was used as our proxy for food availability coastal regions fertilized by continental water outputs strongly influence the surrounding areas yielding higher values yet taking into account the negative effect of non food particles in the water allowed us to also identify larger ultimate lengths in areas with fewer suspended particles and reasonable chlorophyll concentrations such as sc 1 and sc 2 regions known for their mussel culture activities fig 4 shows that there is relevant potential for mussel culture throughout most of the study region and fig 5 shows the temporal dynamics of this potential for brazilian mussel farming in the selected regions the 4 km resolution of each pixel in our simulation is enough to identify sites within the scale of our study region but to pinpoint exact sites where production is relevant one must take into account more specific dynamics such as the geomorphological aspects and specific conditions for each site vertical variation of the forcing variables used in this study was also not considered while using satelite images to perform growth assessments may be practical variables that represent temperature primary production and suspended particles may vary significantly with depth this is true especially for coastal regions where the influence of continental water and dynamics related to vertical mixing can be factors relevant for mussel culture this also means that regions that we did not identify as relevant for mussel culture can potentially have productive sites within their respective pixels that we were not able to detect but regions that we did identify certainly house a potential to develop mussel farming activities this remains relevant especially for regions sp 3 and rj 1 which did not show any significant production potential for mussel farming in our simulations however they could still house specific locations with farming potential that was not detected in this study all the other studied regions showed potential for yearly yields in mussel production with the highest being rj 2 this region is known as a good location for bivalve farming and focuses its economic activities on more lucrative species such as scallops we did not identify any favorable conditions for offshore mussel culture though we identified high growth coefficients in regions close to the 200 meter depth line the ultimate lengths that those regions are able to provide yield mussels that are too small for any commercial purposes we also obtained high growth potential in regions heavily impacted by industrial activity impacted regions such as pr 1 can benefit from mussel farming as it provides other relevant ecosystem services van der schatte olivier et al 2018 such as bio remediation and water clarification in this case farming can be used to control eutrophication and develop healthier environments kotta et al 2020 other than mussel production for food consumption taking the ecosystem services provided by the proposed activity into account when designing and planning a site can ensure more efficient management in these regions building a path towards a more sustainable and efficient land or water use gentry et al 2020 we pointed out several areas where mussel culture can be effectively performed these assessments can be helpful when using techniques like the spatial multi criteria evaluation as used by brigolin et al 2017 as a criterion for identifying suitable aquaculture sites areas with good environmental conditions can be used as a base for regional social economic development initiatives as proposed by carranza et al 2009 for south american mussels in areas like the sp 1 and sp 2 there are no large scale mussel farming activities suplicy 2018a shows that mussel farming can provide high quality food for the growing societal demand more sustainably even suggesting the use of gis for detecting suitable aquaculture sites the model can also be useful in finding a balance between production costs and production yield in different environmental scenarios as done by timmermann et al 2014 understanding the key components of biological communities is relevant in developing effective ecosystem based management actions and also serves as a complement for marine spatial planning crowder and norse 2008 especially in face of high demands for innovative solutions to counter increasing food insecurity our study provides further evidence that bioenergetic models can be coupled with remote sensing offering a pragmatic path to assess conditions for bivalve growth potential along spatial gradients these findings can be used in the context of developing policies for regional development helping the coastal communities obtain important and accessible food sources and also providing knowledge about areas where the brown mussel ecosystem services can be effectively implemented the model allows discussions for spatial management to take place in a broader perspective as using spatialized growth projections can

24354,blooms of toxic or harmful phytoplankton known as harmful algal blooms or habs pose a significant and increasing threat to human health and fisheries throughout the globe the most interesting nature of these habs is their irregularity in terms of both magnitude and frequency of occurrence which makes the prediction of habs difficult although such irregularities are very common in nature the reasons behind them are not well understood here we study a food web model consisting of nutrients toxic phytoplankton non toxic phytoplankton and grazer zooplankton the toxic substance produced by the toxic phytoplankton provides an advantage to both phytoplankton species by suppressing the grazer population we find that the seasonal variation in nutrient concentration shapes the phytoplankton community while the toxic effect results in different seasonal successional patterns additionally our results provide a new mechanism for the irregularity in hab formation examining the impact of toxins on the timing frequency and magnitude of toxic blooms we demonstrate that the bloom dynamics of toxic phytoplankton become irregular and more severe in the presence of high toxic effects while the non toxic phytoplankton show annual blooms we also find that the concentrations of zooplankton and non toxic phytoplankton at the beginning of the year can be indicative of the timing and severity of habs the most severe habs occur during summer and are related to very low zooplankton together with certain specific concentrations of non toxic phytoplankton this improved level of understanding of the factors regulating the timing frequency and severity of habs can help to predict and determine strategies to mitigate the impact of habs on ecosystems and society keywords toxic phytoplankton harmful algal blooms irregular blooms toxin seasonal succession data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction worldwide harmful algal blooms habs are increasing in number and spatial extent wells et al 2020 these blooms can have severe negative impacts on coastal ecosystems potentially leading to serious economic and ecological losses e g gibble et al 2016 dyson and huppert 2010 trainer et al 2000 many hab species produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish and propagate up the food web harming organisms at higher trophic levels such as sea birds sea lions and whales beltrán et al 1997 geraci et al 1989 goldstein et al 2008 in recent years there has been a growing awareness worldwide regarding the production of toxins by a number of hab forming species due to their severe consequences for ecosystem functioning anderson et al 2012 hallegraeff 1993 many factors are suggested to influence the formation and persistence of habs such as nutrient availability and composition anderson et al 2002 light intensity wells et al 2015 and biotic factors such as competition granéli and hansen 2006 and grazing turner 2006 for many hab forming species however the specific mechanisms and environmental conditions required to proliferate are still not well understood especially given the distinctive irregularity of their blooms in terms of both occurrence and abundance anderson et al 2021 bach et al 2019 chakraborty et al 2007 cram et al 2018 mukhopadhyay and bhattacharyya 2006 raw and mishra 2019 stein 1990 compared to the recurrent predictable blooms like spring blooms such unexpected blooms are therefore difficult to predict by researchers and to manage by ecosystem managers harmful algae comprise of a wide variety of different taxa and among them dinoflagellates contribute the highest proportion with 75 80 of hab species smayda and reynolds 2003 adverse effects of harmful algae may be either caused by intracellular toxins e g dutz 1998 frangópulos et al 2000 or by extracellular allelopathic compounds bagøien et al 1996 silva et al 2013 yan et al 2009 these effects are highly variable depending on the strain species investigated and the target species tillmann and john 2002 turner and tester 1997 toxic effects on metazooplankton zooplankton with body composed of cells differentiated into tissues and organs occur when either predators ingest toxic cells demott and moxter 1991 or toxins are released into the water after autolysis feuillade 1994 or cell lysis after a fungal or viral attack berg et al 1987 by contrast adverse effects on protistan consumers do not have cells differentiated into tissues which constitute a major part of the microzooplankton community do not seem to be related to intracellular toxin content e g tillmann and john 2002 but rather to allelopathic substances produced by a variety of harmful algae dinoflagellate allelochemicals are poorly characterized in their chemical nature but may directly damage external membranes and cell integrity ma et al 2011 tillmann and john 2002 these chemicals induce several effects on protistan consumers including growth inhibition e g hattenrath lehmann and gobler 2011 poulson ellestad et al 2014 encystment tillmann et al 2007 cell lysis e g ma et al 2009 tillmann et al 2008 and immobilization of target cells e g tillmann and john 2002 tillmann et al 2008 2007 bloom forming dinoflagellates are often considered inferior competitors compared to other phytoplankton such as diatoms and other flagellates due to their slower growth and nutrient uptake rates banse 1982 honjo 1987 honjo and tabata 1985 smayda 1997 tang 1996 thus for the formation of habs the net growth rate of these species must be comparatively high irrespective of any competitive disadvantage at the level of resource acquisition since grazing by microzooplankton is considered as an important factor in controlling the growth of dinoflagellates calbet et al 2003 stoecker et al 2005 reduced grazing by producing harmful chemicals may support the ecological success of hab forming dinoflagellates and facilitate their dominance in a plankton community overall the production of toxins and allelopathic substances by hab species may offset grazing control by zooplankton van donk and hessen 1993 watanabe et al 1994 either indirectly by shifting grazing preferences to other non toxic competitors guisande et al 2002 and or by direct deleterious effects on the physiology and fertility of predators buskey and hyatt 1995 huntley et al 1986 sukhanov and omelko 2002 teegarden 1999 teramoto et al 1979 turner and anderson 1983 wolfe 2000 however such direct effects do not only benefit the harmful species but also provide a growth advantage to its competitors flynn 2008 and thus cannot be a feasible evolutionary strategy for a weak competitor for resources consequently the question remains how advantageous toxin production is in the presence of competitors that may equally profit from this toxin production in natural systems and what the consequences for plankton dynamics are therefore the mechanisms of direct and indirect toxic or allelopathic effects in a food web context are important to consider in order to unveil their importance for other organisms bloom dynamics and finally ecosystems in the present paper we consider a diamond food web model consisting of nutrients non toxic phytoplankton toxic phytoplankton and zooplankton to investigate how the direct toxic effect on the grazer affects hab dynamics the indirect effect of toxins resulting from the avoidance of toxic species by the grazer during the emergence of habs was previously examined by chakraborty and feudel 2014 here for the first time we have introduced both direct and indirect effects of toxins in a model with seasonal nutrient dynamics we do not distinguish between the impact of toxins and allelopathic substances since both mechanisms though different in their specific action on the grazer can be modelled by the same means namely enhanced mortality of the grazer depending on the concentration of the harmful species throughout this paper we will use the terms toxic species toxicity and toxic effect to simplify explanations however addressing both toxic and allelopathic effects we have chosen toxicity as the most important parameter to vary in this study since a single toxic species can exhibit large variability in toxicity depending on the environmental conditions including the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients anderson 1994 cembella 1998 flynn et al 1996 johansson and granéli 1999 ulitzur and shilo 1964 the effects of the strength of toxicity on irregular toxic bloom dynamics are investigated in an environment with periodic nutrient input here we focus on investigating whether such irregular toxic blooms can result from the internal dynamics of the system specifically we investigate how the toxic effect on zooplankton affects the 1 timing 2 frequency and 3 magnitude of toxic blooms and the 4 seasonal succession of phytoplankton 2 methods 2 1 model description we have considered a model consisting of a nutrient n e g nitrate a non toxic phytoplankton species p n a toxin producing phytoplankton species p t and zooplankton z the two phytoplankton species exploit the nutrient and zooplankton as the grazer feed on the two phytoplankton species n p n p t and z are presented in the same unit of g c m 3 after using the conversion equivalences of 1 g carbon 20 mg chlorophyll 10 mmol nitrate steele and henderson 1981 and the time unit is in days the interactions between different components are determined by the growth of toxic and non toxic phytoplankton upon the nutrient and their competition the growth of zooplankton grazing upon both phytoplankton as well as on the respiration of phytoplankton and the mortality of zooplankton the toxic species is considered as a weak competitor for the resource which is true for many toxic dinoflagellates brand et al 2012 frangópulos et al 2004 but obtains benefit due to grazing avoidance by zooplankton via toxin production guisande et al 2002 plankton growth is assumed to take place in a spatially homogenous oceanic mixed layer the vertical exchange of nutrients and phytoplankton between the mixed layer and deep water due to mixing and sinking respectively are also taken into account together with the recycling of nutrients by bacteria however without explicitly considering equations for bacterial populations deep water is assumed to contain a constant amount of nutrients but no phytoplankton although zooplankton are present throughout the water column they are assumed to be able to maintain their position in the water column and not affected by mixing all these processes are reflected in the following system of differential equations 1a d n d t uptake recycling mixing 1b d p n d t growth respiration grazing by z sinking mixing 1c d p t dt growth respiration grazing by z sinking mixing 1d dz dt growth natural mortality mortality due to toxin in

water and the mixed layer eqs 2a 2b 2c the term n h n represents the nutrient limited growth of phytoplankton where h is the half saturation constant eqs 2a 2b 2c another term a i b c p n c p t a i a n a t describes the limitations of phytoplankton growth due to light attenuation by the water b and self shading of phytoplankton c a n b and a t b represent the maximum daily nutrient uptake rates averaged over the depth of the mixed layer by the non toxic and toxic phytoplankton respectively eqs 2a 2b 2c we assume that both types of phytoplankton only differ in their competitive ability for nutrients non toxic phytoplankton are better competitors for nutrients with a higher nutrient uptake rate compared to the toxic one a n a t this allows the non toxic phytoplankton to acquire higher growth rates compared to the toxic phytoplankton although in natural systems there are some toxic species with high growth rates we stick to the more general case by considering a lower growth rate of toxic phytoplankton species compared to the non toxic ones since this is the case for dinoflagellates brand and guillard 1981 chan 1980 flynn 2008 reynolds 1984 the combined respiratory and natural mortality loss of phytoplankton is denoted by r eqs 2a 2b which is recycled into nutrient eq 2c the vertical transport of phytoplankton consists of two paths firstly get mixed with the phytoplankton devoid deep water at a rate k and secondly sink out of the mixed layer at a rate s eqs 2b 2c the grazing rate is given by the term λ ϕ i p i 2 z μ 2 ϕ n p n 2 ϕ t p t 2 ϕ i p i 2 ϕ n p n 2 ϕ t p t 2 morozov 2010 ryabchenko et al 1997 where λ is the maximum specific zooplankton grazing rate μ is the zooplankton grazing half saturation constant ϕ n and ϕ t are the preferences termed palatability by evans 1988 for non toxic and toxic phytoplankton species eqs 2b 2c respectively and satisfy the condition ϕ n ϕ t 1 we consider a trade off between preferences for toxic and non toxic phytoplankton by zooplankton in such a way that an increase in the preference for one particular prey type would decrease the preference for the other one a higher feeding preference for non toxic phytoplankton ϕ n ϕ t is assumed to be based on evidence that faster growing phytoplankton classes are grazed at highest rates burkill et al 1987 latasa et al 1997 strom and welschmeyer 1991 such preference can also be explained as a trade off between the competitive ability and the grazing resistance of toxic phytoplankton where the toxic species are specialized in defence against predators but are inferior competitors for nutrients the fraction α of the grazed non toxic and toxic phytoplankton fuels the growth of zooplankton eq 2d and another fraction β representing excretion regenerates immediately into utilizable nutrients eq 2a the remaining fraction 1 α β representing faecal pellets produced by zooplankton sink out of the mixed layer and are lost from the system d represents the natural mortality of zooplankton eq 2d where a fraction γ p of dead zooplankton is recycled back into usable nutrient eq 2a whereas the other fraction sink out of the mixed layer apart from natural mortality zooplankton also suffer from additional mortality due to the toxic effect h p t eq 2d previously linear monod and sigmoidal functions were used to represent the mortality due to toxic effects chattopadhayay et al 2002 rehim et al 2015 and references therein in the present paper a sigmoidal functional form is chosen based on the recent experiments by busch 2016 studying the influence of allelochemicals released by the dinoflagellate alexandrium catenella on the growth of the grazer rotifer brachionus plicatilis she observed a sigmoidal declining pattern of b plicatilis with an increase in the cell concentrations of a catenella i e significant inhibition of the growth of the grazer at very high cell densities of toxic prey whereas the growth inhibition remained remarkably low at low toxic prey densities earlier experiments with toxic strains of ochromonas and poterioochromonas on the cladoceran daphnia magna and the rotifer platyias sp also showed similar significant toxic effects only at high cell densities boenigk and stadler 2004 note that a sigmoidal shaped function was previously used by mitra and flynn 2006 to represent toxic interactions between a hab and a non hab forming species based on these results h p t is chosen as a sigmoidal shaped function in the following form 3 h p t θ p t 2 ν 2 p t 2 where θ represents the strength of the toxic effect on zooplankton and ν denotes the half saturation constant sketched in fig 1 a fraction γ t of the dead zooplankton due to toxic effect is recycled back into usable nutrient and the remaining fraction sink out of the mixed layer allelopathic substances may have very different effects on the growth of different target competitor species depending on the cell concentration of donor and target cells as well as on the target s growth rate arzul et al 1999 specifically the sensitivity of the target population decreases if the target cells replicate faster than new allelochemical substances are produced since the allelopathic substances are adsorbed to a variety of surfaces the increase in the number of target cells leads to the removal of compounds from the medium ma et al 2009 the latter finding could be interpreted as a dilution of the allelopathic effect due to a high density of target cells since according to our assumption non toxic phytoplankton grow faster than the toxic one we neglect the toxic effect on the non toxic competitor 2 2 model simulation we have performed numerical simulations to investigate how the toxic effect on zooplankton affects the system dynamics the model was solved numerically using the matlab ode45 solver matlab 2020 except the ordinary differential equation ode calculations for the bifurcation diagrams and the computation of the maximal lyapunov exponent in the supplementary file which were done in fortran using the vode ode solver brown et al 1989 the system was simulated for a total of 650 000 days and the initial 600 000 days were discarded as transients for the bifurcation diagram and the lyapunov exponent calculations additionally an ensemble size of 10 initial conditions for each strength of toxicity θ was used and the parameter θ was varied in steps of 0 002 in the range 0 1 for these calculations to observe the effects of toxicity on seasonal bloom dynamics the temporal variation of the nutrient pool below the mixed layer n 0 are investigated deuser 1986 although plankton blooms depend on the seasonal changes of several environmental factors e g nutrient input light intensity temperature staehr and sand jensen 2006 sundby et al 2016 in the present paper only annual changes in nutrient concentrations are assumed to drive seasonality in phytoplankton specifically n 0 is considered as a periodic function with a period of one year as n 0 σ 1 σ 2 cos 2 π t 365 where t is in units of days and t 0 stands for the first of january although different nutrients like phosphate nitrate or silicate possess different phase shifts as for example measured in the helgoland roads in the north sea freund et al 2006 we neglect this shift to investigate the general impact of a seasonal cycle from a conceptual point of view as in chakraborty and feudel 2014 in the current formulation the seasonal forcing is mainly controlled by two parameters σ 1 and σ 2 σ 1 is the average nutrient concentration during one year and σ 2 0 σ 2 σ 1 is the amplitude of its variation notice that the maximum and minimum values of n 0 t are given by σ 1 σ 2 respectively for numerical simulations we have chosen σ 1 1 g c m 3 and σ 2 0 8 g c m 3 so that the nutrient supply n 0 always remains within the range prescribed in table 1 to provide a quantitative measure of how often a hab would occur on average and how their peak abundances would change with increasing toxic effect the mean time interval between two subsequent habs the mean peak abundances and their variances are computed we assumed that a successful hab is developed when the toxic phytoplankton concentration exceeds 0 05 g c m 3 which is obtained by multiplying the highest cell count of 17 387 cells l 1 observed during a bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate alexandrium catenella at a nearshore site in monterey bay jester et al 2009 with the cellular carbon mass of 3000 pg c cell 1 blossom et al 2019 to analyse the formation of habs in more detail we looked at the time series at a specific toxicity level θ 0 24 in this part we focus only on the seasonally forced model for two reasons 1 seasonal forcing is relevant for most places on the globe where habs are observed and 2 only small toxic effects are necessary to reveal irregular strong blooms which also resembles many natural situations where non toxic blooms occur regularly within a seasonal cycle but toxic ones occur only once in several years belgrano et al 1999 furthermore we picked three separate years showing different successional patterns of bloom formation and explain the mechanisms of succession to quantify the conditions of hab development we looked at the variables at the beginning of the year this helps to understand the conditions that eventually lead to a successful toxic bloom formation we run our simulation for 1400 years and chose the last 1000 years to plot concentrations of nutrient non toxic phytoplankton and zooplankton at the beginning of every year with the maximum concentration of toxic phytoplankton in the same year 3 results 3 1 effects of toxin production on the system dynamics the time series of toxic phytoplankton p t reveal that the system converges to a stable equilibrium fig 2 a in the absence of the toxic effect θ 0 all populations maintain constant biomass after a transient time with a higher abundance of the toxic species though being the inferior competitor compared to the non toxic one which suffers from high grazing pressure due to selectivity an increase in the toxic effect θ 0 2 results in a limit cycle oscillation fig 2b i e the abundances of all populations fluctuate periodically an even higher toxic effect θ 0 43 leads to chaotic behaviour with irregular peak abundances of the toxic species fig 2c with further increase in the toxic effect the bloom dynamics become more complex fig s1 in the supplementary file the presence of chaos is confirmed based on a positive lyapunov exponent used as an indicator fig s2 in the supplementary file from the biological perspective the direct effect of toxins on the grazer shows three different consequences 1 an increasing toxic effect destabilizes the equilibrium between all populations in the system leading first to oscillations representing regular periodic bloom dynamics which become increasingly complex and finally chaotic at rather high toxicities 2 the maximum abundances of toxic phytoplankton are significantly higher in oscillatory and chaotic states compared to the equilibrium and 3 a rather large toxic effect leads to highly fluctuating abundances of the toxic species with rather long time intervals between subsequent blooms 3 2 dynamics in a seasonally varying environment 3 2 1 effects of toxicity on the timing and frequency of habs in a seasonally varying environment fig 3 both phytoplankton form annual early spring blooms followed by small fluctuations in abundances during summer fig 3a d with an increase in the direct toxic effect on zooplankton θ 0 24 habs exhibit irregularity in terms of timing and peak abundance fig 3e while blooms of non toxic phytoplankton still occur every year though temporarily diminished during habs and even persist for longer periods fig 3b this behaviour becomes even more pronounced when the strength of the toxic effect is further increased θ 0 5 leading to rare hab events fig 3f as the frequency of their occurrence becomes very irregular therefore with increasing toxicity the timing of hab events becomes more erratic while its frequency of occurrence becomes lower and irregular fig 4 provides quantitative measures of how the mean time interval between two subsequent habs fig 4a mean peak abundances fig 4c and their variances fig 4b d vary with the strength of toxicity although the correlations appear to be very weak except for the mean time difference with r squared values 0 89 0 05 0 22 0 14 all the measures show increasing trends with toxicity while the time interval between toxic blooms increases strongly with increasing toxic effects the same applies to the average peak abundance and the variabilities reflected by the variance of the time between successive blooms and peak abundances 3 2 2 the mechanism of hab formation the time series of non toxic and toxic phytoplankton in a seasonally varying environment exhibits yearly blooms of the non toxic phytoplankton but rare blooms for the toxic species when the toxicity level is fixed at a particular value θ 0 24 upper panel of fig 5 while non toxic phytoplankton exhibit higher abundances toxic phytoplankton are mostly very low in abundance and only once in several years develop a larger bloom the same dynamics were presented in fig 3b e but with the focus on investigating the variability in the toxic bloom initiation timing on the contrary fig 5 is devoted to explore different seasonal successional patterns which becomes more obvious in a time series plot than in the condensed representation of fig 3b e in general we can explain the formation of a hab as a result of the top down control regulating the bloom dynamics in this model when looking at the details of how a hab emerges three different kinds of successional patterns between non toxic and toxic phytoplankton have been observed corresponding years are marked with a b and c in the upper panel of fig 5 a a small hab with toxic phytoplankton peak concentration of 0 26 g c m 3 emerges early in the year when the zooplankton population is rather large 0 027 g c m 3 at the beginning of the year fig 5a in this case grazers control the bloom of the non toxic species provide a competitive advantage to the toxic one and consequently help to increase its abundance such an increase in toxic species diminishes zooplankton abundance substantially 4 10 4 g c m 3 leading to a recovery of the non toxic species which consequently blooms peak concentration 1 25 g c m 3 and suppresses the toxic one b when the zooplankton abundance is low 5 10 3 g c m 3 at the beginning of the year the non toxic species experiences low grazing pressure and develops a bloom peak concentration 0 6 g c m 3 fig 5b this bloom in turn gives rise to an increasing zooplankton population which finally terminates the non toxic bloom in the middle of the year since abundances of both toxic and non toxic phytoplankton are very low for some time interval known as clear water phase nutrients that enter the mixed layer accumulate with a maximum concentration 0 6 g c m 3 and are used by the toxic species that forms a bloom peak concentration 0 66 g c m 3 leading to low zooplankton abundances 1 10 7 g c m 3 this loss of grazing pressure enables the non toxic species to bloom again in autumn peak concentration 0 92 g c m 3 c the third scenario starts with very low zooplankton abundances 1 10 4 g c m 3 giving rise to a large bloom of the non toxic species peak concentration 1 21 g c m 3 which successfully outcompetes the toxic species for most of the year fig 5c due to a high abundance of non toxic species the zooplankton population recovers by the end of the year peak concentration 0 43 g c m 3 which leads to an increase in the population of the toxic species during autumn peak concentration 0 4 g c m 3 all three different scenarios are crucially dependant on the zooplankton abundance at the beginning of the year emphasizing the strong top down control in this ecosystem model moreover it explains the timing and bloom abundances of habs as a result of such top down control to better understand the conditions of successful toxic bloom formation we plotted nutrient non toxic phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations at the beginning of the year fig 6 two situations are found to be responsible for high toxic phytoplankton concentrations 0 4 g c m 3 1 low zooplankton 0 02 g c m 3 with non toxic phytoplankton concentration 0 12 g c m 3 at the beginning of the year fig 6b c non toxic phytoplankton increase in the beginning of the year however this also increases zooplankton and finally suppresses the non toxic phytoplankton resulting in a toxic phytoplankton bloom in summer or autumn fig 5c d 2 relatively lower non toxic phytoplankton 0 12 g c m 3 with zooplankton concentration 0 02 g c m 3 at the beginning of the year fig 6b c there is a small peak of toxic phytoplankton during spring however this suppresses zooplankton and helps non toxic phytoplankton to dominate for the rest of the year fig 5a therefore it is clear that summer is the ideal time for toxic phytoplankton to bloom and it needs certain concentrations of non toxic phytoplankton 0 12 p n 0 16 g c m 3 and zooplankton 0 02 g c m 3 4 discussion our study aimed to explore the potential role of harmful substances produced by toxic phytoplankton on herbivores and to investigate the feedback on phytoplankton dynamics particularly on the formation of habs inspired by the experimental observations of busch 2016 we incorporated the impact of harmful substances produced by the toxic species on the grazer by employing enhanced mortality of the grazer depending on the abundance of the harmful species in this specific experiment the observed impact on grazer mortality was mainly due to allelopathic substances our model is designed to be more general and applicable for the impact of both toxins and allelopathic substances on the consumer focusing on the direct toxic effects we found several consequences for the dynamics of the toxic blooms 4 1 model validation we compared simulated biomasses with empirical data to evaluate how well the model matches real ecosystems we chose the data for the allelopathic and toxin producing dinoflagellate alexandrium catenella associated with elevated shellfish toxicity from the highly productive central california coast during the summers of 2004 and 2005 a maximum a catenella concentration of 17 387 cells l 1 was measured at a nearshore site in monterey bay jester et al 2009 after converting cell densities to carbon mass by using 3000 pg c cell 1 blossom et al 2019 the peak a catenella concentration becomes 0 05 g c m 3 for another dense bloom forming ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate karlodinium veneficum which is known for its toxic effects on grazers and massive fish kills in several parts of the globe general bloom concentrations lie between 10 4 cells ml 1 and 10 5 cells ml 1 adolf et al 2007 hall et al 2008 converting to carbon mass using 120 pg carbon per cell brownlee et al 2008 the range turns into 1 2 g c m3 12 g c m 3 clearly our simulated range of the mean peak toxic phytoplankton concentrations 0 1 g c m 3 1 g c m 3 during toxic bloom events fig 4b lies within observed toxic phytoplankton bloom concentrations 0 05 g c m 3 12 g c m 3 in natural systems data from the gotland sea southern baltic sea show a range of biomasses of non toxic phytoplankton using 0 01 g chl g c 1 geider 1993 and zooplankton as 0 2 g c m 3 2 4 g c m 3 and 0 02 g c m 3 0 4 g c m 3 casini et al 2008 that match nicely with our simulated range 0 8 g c m 3 1 3 g c m 3 and 0 2 g c m 3 0 6 g c m 3 however these maximum bloom biomasses can vary between ecosystems depending on nutrient availability and other factors 4 2 effects of toxins on the system stability an increase in the strength of the toxic effect on zooplankton leads to a destabilization of the system i e first it shows limit cycle oscillations and finally exhibits chaotic oscillations at very high toxic effects a similar destabilizing role of toxic chemicals can be found in other models studying hab dynamics where toxic effects are characterized as one of the responsible factors for promoting habs chakraborty et al 2015 raw and mishra 2019 scotti et al 2015 by contrast a large number of modelling studies demonstrate a stabilizing role of toxic chemicals for system dynamics by diminishing oscillations in the system chattopadhayay et al 2002 jang et al 2014 mukhopadhyay and bhattacharyya 2006 interestingly toxic effects have also been found to have both stabilizing and destabilizing effects in a system depending on the strength of toxin production rate jang and allen 2015 the stability of a dynamical system depends on the positive and negative feedback loops generated due to interactions between different components of the system berryman and millstein 1989 the positive feedback processes e g reproduction cooperative behaviour interspecific competition lead to instability via exponential growth oscillation or chaotic behaviour whereas the negative feedback components e g predator numerical responses food depletion and recovery promote stability therefore a system becomes chaotic when the negative feedback is overcompensated and the system is continuously displaced into its positive feedback domain although it is argued that feedbacks are responsible for generating chaos in dynamic systems density dependence is central to the notion of chaos in ecology berryman and millstein 1989 the present study reveals that the growth suppression of zooplankton by toxic chemicals which depends on the concentration of toxic phytoplankton provides a growth advantage to both phytoplankton species and acts as a positive feedback that can result in chaotic oscillation in plankton systems additionally during the destabilization our system shows dangerously small population sizes there is a variety of mechanisms such as demographic stochasticity environmental stochasticity natural catastrophes genetic inbreeding edge effects the antirescue effect and the allee effect that threaten small populations by leading them to extinction e g lande 1988 pimm et al 1988 soulé 1987 analysis of real data and laboratory experiments also support the view that large fluctuations are severe enough to increase the likelihood of population extinction belovsky et al 1999 fagan et al 2001 however in the real world plankton populations are distributed over large spatial scales where several other mechanisms e g immigration prevent local population extinction hufbauer et al 2015 4 3 effects of toxins on bloom dynamics due to their inferior competitive ability for nutrients the toxic species is suppressed by its competitor and unable to reach high abundances in the absence of any selective predation by the grazer chakraborty and feudel 2014 selective feeding leading to a low preference for toxic phytoplankton by the grazer yields better growth conditions for toxic phytoplankton despite the higher growth rate of the non toxic species its abundance is significantly decreased due to high grazing pressure the presence of a simultaneous toxic effect shows surprising consequences for the bloom dynamics as the toxic species grows the negative effect sets in diminishing zooplankton abundance and subsequently decreasing the grazing pressure on both phytoplankton species consequently the non toxic species can recover and grow again and due to its superior competitive ability suppress the toxic species this indicates that toxin production which negatively affects the grazers does finally not pay off for a weak competitor for resources unless the grazer population shows selective predation in response to toxin production to provide a growth advantage to the toxic species toxins that affect the grazer directly provide an advantage to the species with higher competitive ability for nutrients therefore because of being the superior nutrient competitor non toxic phytoplankton obtain an advantage due to the direct toxic effect however during the initial phase of a bloom when nutrient conditions are not limiting selective predation rather than direct toxic effects plays an important role in bloom formation of toxin producing phytoplankton solé et al 2005 the direct toxic effect becomes important only when the abundance of toxic phytoplankton becomes significantly higher compared to their competitors and is able to compensate their competitive disadvantage although the toxic species obtains the competitive advantage only for a short time period as high toxic species abundance diminishes the grazer too heavily as a result the competitor is released from the grazing pressure and can increase in abundance again and finally outcompetes the toxic species however under natural conditions even at low average cell concentrations spatial variation in cell concentration may be high patches of increased a catenella cell numbers can occur when for instance cells are being transported onshore during relaxation favourable winds langlois and smith 2001 price et al 1991 and thus accumulate in shallow nearshore waters the formation of localized patches and thin layers which can also be observed for alexandrium spp in culture flasks grown under non turbulent conditions within which toxic phytoplankton can increase in cell numbers to abundances high enough to deter potential grazers and competitors by the accumulation of allelochemicals may therefore constitute a key factor for bloom initiation tillmann et al 2008 4 4 frequency and severity of habs at higher toxicity levels the emergence of habs becomes irregular in peak abundance and frequency while the non toxic species blooms regularly every year this irregularity of hab formation is purely deterministic and does not need any stochastic forcing therefore the results obtained in this model are novel and distinct from other studies which also aim at explaining irregularity in the emergence of habs bailey et al 2004 chakraborty and feudel 2014 freund et al 2006 while in other models irregularity is imposed due to a stochastic forcing such as fluctuations of temperature freund et al 2006 or grazer abundance chakraborty and feudel 2014 the mechanism presented here is solely based on nonlinear positive feedback between the abundance of the toxic species and the mortality of zooplankton due to toxins periodic variations in environmental factors were also found to result in pure deterministic irregular bloom dynamics chakraborty et al 2007 jang and allen 2015 however the presence of irregular blooms by toxic phytoplankton and regular annual blooms by non toxic phytoplankton in a single model makes the present study unique the irregular occurrence of habs in nature has been emphasized several times belgrano et al 1999 cardoso 2012 hotes and pearson 1977 padmakumar et al 2012 pick 2016 however only a few studies have specifically focused on the role of toxins on the emergence of irregularities in hab formation so far chakraborty and feudel 2014 showed that selective predation by grazers on different phytoplankton populations can yield irregularity in the occurrence of toxic phytoplankton blooms such selectivity in predation can also occur due to an indirect effect of toxin production waggett et al 2008 by contrast we investigate the role of a direct toxic effect on the grazer in the present study and the mechanisms of bloom formation are completely different from chakraborty and feudel 2014 our results show that an increase in toxicity results in the skipping of hab formation in some years while very strong toxic effects make hab events even rarer this is due to the fact that with increasing toxic effects the abundance of zooplankton becomes so low that this population needs a long recovery time and consequently habs disappear for a longer time period therefore toxic effects may not only be important for the toxic bloom dynamics in the same year but may also affect the bloom dynamics in subsequent years by contrast as the mean peak abundances and the variance of the peaks increase a strong toxic effect leads to habs with extremely large peak abundances in response to increasing irregularity in occurrence leading to a decreasing frequency of habs the co occurring species and grazers would not receive frequent challenges to respond to toxins so that they might lose the ability to select their prey and to develop a specific resistance which would make the impact of habs on these co occurring species more severe 4 5 seasonal succession of plankton plankton seasonal succession is generally considered as a series of transitions between different community states resulting from the internal dynamics of species replacements affected by external perturbations klausmeier and litchman 2012 the seasonal variation in nutrient concentration is known to shape the phytoplankton community and together with physical factors result in the seasonal succession pilkaityte and razinkovas 2007 in the present study the toxic effect on zooplankton plays the role of an indirect physical factor by affecting zooplankton negatively and results in different seasonal successional patterns for a certain range of the strength of toxicity our results demonstrate that a spring bloom of highly preferred non toxic phytoplankton is followed by a bloom of slow growing grazing resistant and toxin producing phytoplankton in the summer and finally another bloom of non toxic phytoplankton in the fall this kind of phytoplankton succession is very common in many lakes vanni and temte 1990 as well as in marine systems roden 1984 when the toxic effect becomes high toxic blooms sometimes can occur earlier in the season such early seasonal dominance of grazing resistant inferior competitors has been reported by deneke and nixdorf 1999 and klausmeier and litchman 2012 as well also the influence of allelopathic interactions among phytoplankton competitors on seasonal succession was previously observed by keating 1977 in a freshwater pond system 4 6 the generality of the model although the present study focuses on the role of dinoflagellate toxins that negatively affect grazers either by increasing mortality or reducing the growth rate and or reproduction rate of the grazer the model can also be applied to toxic cyanobacteria or any other phytoplankton species showing defence against predation the main criteria are that the organism should be an inferior competitor for resources and must have a direct negative effect on the grazer since many toxic cyanobacterial strains are weaker competitors than non toxic strains kardinaal et al 2007 our model can be applied to cyanobacteria dominated systems many species of phytoplankton which are weak competitors have evolved certain defensive traits that negatively affect grazers thus reducing predation pressure on the defended organisms for example due to the bioluminescent nature of some dinoflagellates buskey and swift 1983 the swimming behaviour of grazers gets disturbed resulting in reduced feeding efficiency of these organisms buskey et al 1983 buskey and swift 1983 at the same time flashes of light attract secondary predators that incur extra mortality on the grazer fleisher and case 1995 mesinger and case 1992 under nutrient limiting conditions the nutritional value of some phytoplankton decreases resulting in reduced ingestion rates by grazers cowles et al 1988 van donk and hessen 1993 and can simultaneously lead to a reduction in growth rates yoshida et al 2003 yoshida et al 2004 that can make that species a weak competitor therefore many other species apart from toxic dinoflagellates can also have the potential to form irregular blooms 4 7 future work validation of current theoretical results using field observations sets the stage for further work to this end separating diverse natural communities into functional groups would be the primary step to match with our model structure among different groups of phytoplankton some specific groups showing rare but recurrent success e g hab species need rigorous modelling studies supported by experimental data sets that include complex feedback between ecosystem components furthermore the current model can be extended by introducing several grazers and non toxic species with different sensitivities to toxins and allelopathic substances together with feedback from higher trophic level organisms roman and mccarthy 2010 another interesting future step would be to extend the model by incorporating horizontal movement either passive or active of nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton as dispersal was shown to strongly affect hab competition and bloom dynamics along horizontal gradients e g purz et al 2021 the work on more complex models would provide further insights into this problem by revealing the effect of toxins on community level consequences it will also lead to a better and clearer understanding of the mechanisms for the initiation of such devastating events and will help to regulate local coastal habs or oceanic blooms of

24354,blooms of toxic or harmful phytoplankton known as harmful algal blooms or habs pose a significant and increasing threat to human health and fisheries throughout the globe the most interesting nature of these habs is their irregularity in terms of both magnitude and frequency of occurrence which makes the prediction of habs difficult although such irregularities are very common in nature the reasons behind them are not well understood here we study a food web model consisting of nutrients toxic phytoplankton non toxic phytoplankton and grazer zooplankton the toxic substance produced by the toxic phytoplankton provides an advantage to both phytoplankton species by suppressing the grazer population we find that the seasonal variation in nutrient concentration shapes the phytoplankton community while the toxic effect results in different seasonal successional patterns additionally our results provide a new mechanism for the irregularity in hab formation examining the impact of toxins on the timing frequency and magnitude of toxic blooms we demonstrate that the bloom dynamics of toxic phytoplankton become irregular and more severe in the presence of high toxic effects while the non toxic phytoplankton show annual blooms we also find that the concentrations of zooplankton and non toxic phytoplankton at the beginning of the year can be indicative of the timing and severity of habs the most severe habs occur during summer and are related to very low zooplankton together with certain specific concentrations of non toxic phytoplankton this improved level of understanding of the factors regulating the timing frequency and severity of habs can help to predict and determine strategies to mitigate the impact of habs on ecosystems and society keywords toxic phytoplankton harmful algal blooms irregular blooms toxin seasonal succession data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction worldwide harmful algal blooms habs are increasing in number and spatial extent wells et al 2020 these blooms can have severe negative impacts on coastal ecosystems potentially leading to serious economic and ecological losses e g gibble et al 2016 dyson and huppert 2010 trainer et al 2000 many hab species produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish and propagate up the food web harming organisms at higher trophic levels such as sea birds sea lions and whales beltrán et al 1997 geraci et al 1989 goldstein et al 2008 in recent years there has been a growing awareness worldwide regarding the production of toxins by a number of hab forming species due to their severe consequences for ecosystem functioning anderson et al 2012 hallegraeff 1993 many factors are suggested to influence the formation and persistence of habs such as nutrient availability and composition anderson et al 2002 light intensity wells et al 2015 and biotic factors such as competition granéli and hansen 2006 and grazing turner 2006 for many hab forming species however the specific mechanisms and environmental conditions required to proliferate are still not well understood especially given the distinctive irregularity of their blooms in terms of both occurrence and abundance anderson et al 2021 bach et al 2019 chakraborty et al 2007 cram et al 2018 mukhopadhyay and bhattacharyya 2006 raw and mishra 2019 stein 1990 compared to the recurrent predictable blooms like spring blooms such unexpected blooms are therefore difficult to predict by researchers and to manage by ecosystem managers harmful algae comprise of a wide variety of different taxa and among them dinoflagellates contribute the highest proportion with 75 80 of hab species smayda and reynolds 2003 adverse effects of harmful algae may be either caused by intracellular toxins e g dutz 1998 frangópulos et al 2000 or by extracellular allelopathic compounds bagøien et al 1996 silva et al 2013 yan et al 2009 these effects are highly variable depending on the strain species investigated and the target species tillmann and john 2002 turner and tester 1997 toxic effects on metazooplankton zooplankton with body composed of cells differentiated into tissues and organs occur when either predators ingest toxic cells demott and moxter 1991 or toxins are released into the water after autolysis feuillade 1994 or cell lysis after a fungal or viral attack berg et al 1987 by contrast adverse effects on protistan consumers do not have cells differentiated into tissues which constitute a major part of the microzooplankton community do not seem to be related to intracellular toxin content e g tillmann and john 2002 but rather to allelopathic substances produced by a variety of harmful algae dinoflagellate allelochemicals are poorly characterized in their chemical nature but may directly damage external membranes and cell integrity ma et al 2011 tillmann and john 2002 these chemicals induce several effects on protistan consumers including growth inhibition e g hattenrath lehmann and gobler 2011 poulson ellestad et al 2014 encystment tillmann et al 2007 cell lysis e g ma et al 2009 tillmann et al 2008 and immobilization of target cells e g tillmann and john 2002 tillmann et al 2008 2007 bloom forming dinoflagellates are often considered inferior competitors compared to other phytoplankton such as diatoms and other flagellates due to their slower growth and nutrient uptake rates banse 1982 honjo 1987 honjo and tabata 1985 smayda 1997 tang 1996 thus for the formation of habs the net growth rate of these species must be comparatively high irrespective of any competitive disadvantage at the level of resource acquisition since grazing by microzooplankton is considered as an important factor in controlling the growth of dinoflagellates calbet et al 2003 stoecker et al 2005 reduced grazing by producing harmful chemicals may support the ecological success of hab forming dinoflagellates and facilitate their dominance in a plankton community overall the production of toxins and allelopathic substances by hab species may offset grazing control by zooplankton van donk and hessen 1993 watanabe et al 1994 either indirectly by shifting grazing preferences to other non toxic competitors guisande et al 2002 and or by direct deleterious effects on the physiology and fertility of predators buskey and hyatt 1995 huntley et al 1986 sukhanov and omelko 2002 teegarden 1999 teramoto et al 1979 turner and anderson 1983 wolfe 2000 however such direct effects do not only benefit the harmful species but also provide a growth advantage to its competitors flynn 2008 and thus cannot be a feasible evolutionary strategy for a weak competitor for resources consequently the question remains how advantageous toxin production is in the presence of competitors that may equally profit from this toxin production in natural systems and what the consequences for plankton dynamics are therefore the mechanisms of direct and indirect toxic or allelopathic effects in a food web context are important to consider in order to unveil their importance for other organisms bloom dynamics and finally ecosystems in the present paper we consider a diamond food web model consisting of nutrients non toxic phytoplankton toxic phytoplankton and zooplankton to investigate how the direct toxic effect on the grazer affects hab dynamics the indirect effect of toxins resulting from the avoidance of toxic species by the grazer during the emergence of habs was previously examined by chakraborty and feudel 2014 here for the first time we have introduced both direct and indirect effects of toxins in a model with seasonal nutrient dynamics we do not distinguish between the impact of toxins and allelopathic substances since both mechanisms though different in their specific action on the grazer can be modelled by the same means namely enhanced mortality of the grazer depending on the concentration of the harmful species throughout this paper we will use the terms toxic species toxicity and toxic effect to simplify explanations however addressing both toxic and allelopathic effects we have chosen toxicity as the most important parameter to vary in this study since a single toxic species can exhibit large variability in toxicity depending on the environmental conditions including the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients anderson 1994 cembella 1998 flynn et al 1996 johansson and granéli 1999 ulitzur and shilo 1964 the effects of the strength of toxicity on irregular toxic bloom dynamics are investigated in an environment with periodic nutrient input here we focus on investigating whether such irregular toxic blooms can result from the internal dynamics of the system specifically we investigate how the toxic effect on zooplankton affects the 1 timing 2 frequency and 3 magnitude of toxic blooms and the 4 seasonal succession of phytoplankton 2 methods 2 1 model description we have considered a model consisting of a nutrient n e g nitrate a non toxic phytoplankton species p n a toxin producing phytoplankton species p t and zooplankton z the two phytoplankton species exploit the nutrient and zooplankton as the grazer feed on the two phytoplankton species n p n p t and z are presented in the same unit of g c m 3 after using the conversion equivalences of 1 g carbon 20 mg chlorophyll 10 mmol nitrate steele and henderson 1981 and the time unit is in days the interactions between different components are determined by the growth of toxic and non toxic phytoplankton upon the nutrient and their competition the growth of zooplankton grazing upon both phytoplankton as well as on the respiration of phytoplankton and the mortality of zooplankton the toxic species is considered as a weak competitor for the resource which is true for many toxic dinoflagellates brand et al 2012 frangópulos et al 2004 but obtains benefit due to grazing avoidance by zooplankton via toxin production guisande et al 2002 plankton growth is assumed to take place in a spatially homogenous oceanic mixed layer the vertical exchange of nutrients and phytoplankton between the mixed layer and deep water due to mixing and sinking respectively are also taken into account together with the recycling of nutrients by bacteria however without explicitly considering equations for bacterial populations deep water is assumed to contain a constant amount of nutrients but no phytoplankton although zooplankton are present throughout the water column they are assumed to be able to maintain their position in the water column and not affected by mixing all these processes are reflected in the following system of differential equations 1a d n d t uptake recycling mixing 1b d p n d t growth respiration grazing by z sinking mixing 1c d p t dt growth respiration grazing by z sinking mixing 1d dz dt growth natural mortality mortality due to toxin in explicit functional forms the model reads 2a d n d t i n t n h n a i p i b c p n c p t r i n t p i β i n t λ ϕ i p i 2 z μ 2 ϕ n p n 2 ϕ t p t 2 γ p d z γ t h p t z k n 0 n 2b d p n d t n h n a n p n

p n 2 ϕ t p t 2 dz h p t z here n 0 is the nutrient concentration in the deep water and enters the mixed layer due to diffusive mixing eq 2a where k is the exchange rate of water between the deep water and the mixed layer eqs 2a 2b 2c the term n h n represents the nutrient limited growth of phytoplankton where h is the half saturation constant eqs 2a 2b 2c another term a i b c p n c p t a i a n a t describes the limitations of phytoplankton growth due to light attenuation by the water b and self shading of phytoplankton c a n b and a t b represent the maximum daily nutrient uptake rates averaged over the depth of the mixed layer by the non toxic and toxic phytoplankton respectively eqs 2a 2b 2c we assume that both types of phytoplankton only differ in their competitive ability for nutrients non toxic phytoplankton are better competitors for nutrients with a higher nutrient uptake rate compared to the toxic one a n a t this allows the non toxic phytoplankton to acquire higher growth rates compared to the toxic phytoplankton although in natural systems there are some toxic species with high growth rates we stick to the more general case by considering a lower growth rate of toxic phytoplankton species compared to the non toxic ones since this is the case for dinoflagellates brand and guillard 1981 chan 1980 flynn 2008 reynolds 1984 the combined respiratory and natural mortality loss of phytoplankton is denoted by r eqs 2a 2b which is recycled into nutrient eq 2c the vertical transport of phytoplankton consists of two paths firstly get mixed with the phytoplankton devoid deep water at a rate k and secondly sink out of the mixed layer at a rate s eqs 2b 2c the grazing rate is given by the term λ ϕ i p i 2 z μ 2 ϕ n p n 2 ϕ t p t 2 ϕ i p i 2 ϕ n p n 2 ϕ t p t 2 morozov 2010 ryabchenko et al 1997 where λ is the maximum specific zooplankton grazing rate μ is the zooplankton grazing half saturation constant ϕ n and ϕ t are the preferences termed palatability by evans 1988 for non toxic and toxic phytoplankton species eqs 2b 2c respectively and satisfy the condition ϕ n ϕ t 1 we consider a trade off between preferences for toxic and non toxic phytoplankton by zooplankton in such a way that an increase in the preference for one particular prey type would decrease the preference for the other one a higher feeding preference for non toxic phytoplankton ϕ n ϕ t is assumed to be based on evidence that faster growing phytoplankton classes are grazed at highest rates burkill et al 1987 latasa et al 1997 strom and welschmeyer 1991 such preference can also be explained as a trade off between the competitive ability and the grazing resistance of toxic phytoplankton where the toxic species are specialized in defence against predators but are inferior competitors for nutrients the fraction α of the grazed non toxic and toxic phytoplankton fuels the growth of zooplankton eq 2d and another fraction β representing excretion regenerates immediately into utilizable nutrients eq 2a the remaining fraction 1 α β representing faecal pellets produced by zooplankton sink out of the mixed layer and are lost from the system d represents the natural mortality of zooplankton eq 2d where a fraction γ p of dead zooplankton is recycled back into usable nutrient eq 2a whereas the other fraction sink out of the mixed layer apart from natural mortality zooplankton also suffer from additional mortality due to the toxic effect h p t eq 2d previously linear monod and sigmoidal functions were used to represent the mortality due to toxic effects chattopadhayay et al 2002 rehim et al 2015 and references therein in the present paper a sigmoidal functional form is chosen based on the recent experiments by busch 2016 studying the influence of allelochemicals released by the dinoflagellate alexandrium catenella on the growth of the grazer rotifer brachionus plicatilis she observed a sigmoidal declining pattern of b plicatilis with an increase in the cell concentrations of a catenella i e significant inhibition of the growth of the grazer at very high cell densities of toxic prey whereas the growth inhibition remained remarkably low at low toxic prey densities earlier experiments with toxic strains of ochromonas and poterioochromonas on the cladoceran daphnia magna and the rotifer platyias sp also showed similar significant toxic effects only at high cell densities boenigk and stadler 2004 note that a sigmoidal shaped function was previously used by mitra and flynn 2006 to represent toxic interactions between a hab and a non hab forming species based on these results h p t is chosen as a sigmoidal shaped function in the following form 3 h p t θ p t 2 ν 2 p t 2 where θ represents the strength of the toxic effect on zooplankton and ν denotes the half saturation constant sketched in fig 1 a fraction γ t of the dead zooplankton due to toxic effect is recycled back into usable nutrient and the remaining fraction sink out of the mixed layer allelopathic substances may have very different effects on the growth of different target competitor species depending on the cell concentration of donor and target cells as well as on the target s growth rate arzul et al 1999 specifically the sensitivity of the target population decreases if the target cells replicate faster than new allelochemical substances are produced since the allelopathic substances are adsorbed to a variety of surfaces the increase in the number of target cells leads to the removal of compounds from the medium ma et al 2009 the latter finding could be interpreted as a dilution of the allelopathic effect due to a high density of target cells since according to our assumption non toxic phytoplankton grow faster than the toxic one we neglect the toxic effect on the non toxic competitor 2 2 model simulation we have performed numerical simulations to investigate how the toxic effect on zooplankton affects the system dynamics the model was solved numerically using the matlab ode45 solver matlab 2020 except the ordinary differential equation ode calculations for the bifurcation diagrams and the computation of the maximal lyapunov exponent in the supplementary file which were done in fortran using the vode ode solver brown et al 1989 the system was simulated for a total of 650 000 days and the initial 600 000 days were discarded as transients for the bifurcation diagram and the lyapunov exponent calculations additionally an ensemble size of 10 initial conditions for each strength of toxicity θ was used and the parameter θ was varied in steps of 0 002 in the range 0 1 for these calculations to observe the effects of toxicity on seasonal bloom dynamics the temporal variation of the nutrient pool below the mixed layer n 0 are investigated deuser 1986 although plankton blooms depend on the seasonal changes of several environmental factors e g nutrient input light intensity temperature staehr and sand jensen 2006 sundby et al 2016 in the present paper only annual changes in nutrient concentrations are assumed to drive seasonality in phytoplankton specifically n 0 is considered as a periodic function with a period of one year as n 0 σ 1 σ 2 cos 2 π t 365 where t is in units of days and t 0 stands for the first of january although different nutrients like phosphate nitrate or silicate possess different phase shifts as for example measured in the helgoland roads in the north sea freund et al 2006 we neglect this shift to investigate the general impact of a seasonal cycle from a conceptual point of view as in chakraborty and feudel 2014 in the current formulation the seasonal forcing is mainly controlled by two parameters σ 1 and σ 2 σ 1 is the average nutrient concentration during one year and σ 2 0 σ 2 σ 1 is the amplitude of its variation notice that the maximum and minimum values of n 0 t are given by σ 1 σ 2 respectively for numerical simulations we have chosen σ 1 1 g c m 3 and σ 2 0 8 g c m 3 so that the nutrient supply n 0 always remains within the range prescribed in table 1 to provide a quantitative measure of how often a hab would occur on average and how their peak abundances would change with increasing toxic effect the mean time interval between two subsequent habs the mean peak abundances and their variances are computed we assumed that a successful hab is developed when the toxic phytoplankton concentration exceeds 0 05 g c m 3 which is obtained by multiplying the highest cell count of 17 387 cells l 1 observed during a bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate alexandrium catenella at a nearshore site in monterey bay jester et al 2009 with the cellular carbon mass of 3000 pg c cell 1 blossom et al 2019 to analyse the formation of habs in more detail we looked at the time series at a specific toxicity level θ 0 24 in this part we focus only on the seasonally forced model for two reasons 1 seasonal forcing is relevant for most places on the globe where habs are observed and 2 only small toxic effects are necessary to reveal irregular strong blooms which also resembles many natural situations where non toxic blooms occur regularly within a seasonal cycle but toxic ones occur only once in several years belgrano et al 1999 furthermore we picked three separate years showing different successional patterns of bloom formation and explain the mechanisms of succession to quantify the conditions of hab development we looked at the variables at the beginning of the year this helps to understand the conditions that eventually lead to a successful toxic bloom formation we run our simulation for 1400 years and chose the last 1000 years to plot concentrations of nutrient non toxic phytoplankton and zooplankton at the beginning of every year with the maximum concentration of toxic phytoplankton in the same year 3 results 3 1 effects of toxin production on the system dynamics the time series of toxic phytoplankton p t reveal that the system converges to a stable equilibrium fig 2 a in the absence of the toxic effect θ 0 all populations maintain constant biomass after a transient time with a higher abundance of the toxic species though being the inferior competitor compared to the non toxic one which suffers from high grazing pressure due to selectivity an increase in the toxic effect θ 0 2 results in a limit cycle oscillation fig 2b i e the abundances of all populations fluctuate periodically an even higher toxic effect θ 0 43 leads to chaotic behaviour with irregular peak abundances of the toxic species fig 2c with further increase in the toxic effect the bloom dynamics become more complex fig s1 in the supplementary file the presence of chaos is confirmed based on a positive lyapunov exponent used as an indicator fig s2 in the supplementary file from the biological perspective the direct effect of toxins on the grazer shows three different consequences 1 an increasing toxic effect destabilizes the equilibrium between all populations in the system leading first to oscillations representing regular periodic bloom dynamics which become increasingly complex and finally chaotic at rather high toxicities 2 the maximum abundances of toxic phytoplankton are significantly higher in oscillatory and chaotic states compared to the equilibrium and 3 a rather large toxic effect leads to highly fluctuating abundances of the toxic species with rather long time intervals between subsequent blooms 3 2 dynamics in a seasonally varying environment 3 2 1 effects of toxicity on the timing and frequency of habs in a seasonally varying environment fig 3 both phytoplankton form annual early spring blooms followed by small fluctuations in abundances during summer fig 3a d with an increase in the direct toxic effect on zooplankton θ 0 24 habs exhibit irregularity in terms of timing and peak abundance fig 3e while blooms of non toxic phytoplankton still occur every year though temporarily diminished during habs and even persist for longer periods fig 3b this behaviour becomes even more pronounced when the strength of the toxic effect is further increased θ 0 5 leading to rare hab events fig 3f as the frequency of their occurrence becomes very irregular therefore with increasing toxicity the timing of hab events becomes more erratic while its frequency of occurrence becomes lower and irregular fig 4 provides quantitative measures of how the mean time interval between two subsequent habs fig 4a mean peak abundances fig 4c and their variances fig 4b d vary with the strength of toxicity although the correlations appear to be very weak except for the mean time difference with r squared values 0 89 0 05 0 22 0 14 all the measures show increasing trends with toxicity while the time interval between toxic blooms increases strongly with increasing toxic effects the same applies to the average peak abundance and the variabilities reflected by the variance of the time between successive blooms and peak abundances 3 2 2 the mechanism of hab formation the time series of non toxic and toxic phytoplankton in a seasonally varying environment exhibits yearly blooms of the non toxic phytoplankton but rare blooms for the toxic species when the toxicity level is fixed at a particular value θ 0 24 upper panel of fig 5 while non toxic phytoplankton exhibit higher abundances toxic phytoplankton are mostly very low in abundance and only once in several years develop a larger bloom the same dynamics were presented in fig 3b e but with the focus on investigating the variability in the toxic bloom initiation timing on the contrary fig 5 is devoted to explore different seasonal successional patterns which becomes more obvious in a time series plot than in the condensed representation of fig 3b e in general we can explain the formation of a hab as a result of the top down control regulating the bloom dynamics in this model when looking at the details of how a hab emerges three different kinds of successional patterns between non toxic and toxic phytoplankton have been observed corresponding years are marked with a b and c in the upper panel of fig 5 a a small hab with toxic phytoplankton peak concentration of 0 26 g c m 3 emerges early in the year when the zooplankton population is rather large 0 027 g c m 3 at the beginning of the year fig 5a in this case grazers control the bloom of the non toxic species provide a competitive advantage to the toxic one and consequently help to increase its abundance such an increase in toxic species diminishes zooplankton abundance substantially 4 10 4 g c m 3 leading to a recovery of the non toxic species which consequently blooms peak concentration 1 25 g c m 3 and suppresses the toxic one b when the zooplankton abundance is low 5 10 3 g c m 3 at the beginning of the year the non toxic species experiences low grazing pressure and develops a bloom peak concentration 0 6 g c m 3 fig 5b this bloom in turn gives rise to an increasing zooplankton population which finally terminates the non toxic bloom in the middle of the year since abundances of both toxic and non toxic phytoplankton are very low for some time interval known as clear water phase nutrients that enter the mixed layer accumulate with a maximum concentration 0 6 g c m 3 and are used by the toxic species that forms a bloom peak concentration 0 66 g c m 3 leading to low zooplankton abundances 1 10 7 g c m 3 this loss of grazing pressure enables the non toxic species to bloom again in autumn peak concentration 0 92 g c m 3 c the third scenario starts with very low zooplankton abundances 1 10 4 g c m 3 giving rise to a large bloom of the non toxic species peak concentration 1 21 g c m 3 which successfully outcompetes the toxic species for most of the year fig 5c due to a high abundance of non toxic species the zooplankton population recovers by the end of the year peak concentration 0 43 g c m 3 which leads to an increase in the population of the toxic species during autumn peak concentration 0 4 g c m 3 all three different scenarios are crucially dependant on the zooplankton abundance at the beginning of the year emphasizing the strong top down control in this ecosystem model moreover it explains the timing and bloom abundances of habs as a result of such top down control to better understand the conditions of successful toxic bloom formation we plotted nutrient non toxic phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations at the beginning of the year fig 6 two situations are found to be responsible for high toxic phytoplankton concentrations 0 4 g c m 3 1 low zooplankton 0 02 g c m 3 with non toxic phytoplankton concentration 0 12 g c m 3 at the beginning of the year fig 6b c non toxic phytoplankton increase in the beginning of the year however this also increases zooplankton and finally suppresses the non toxic phytoplankton resulting in a toxic phytoplankton bloom in summer or autumn fig 5c d 2 relatively lower non toxic phytoplankton 0 12 g c m 3 with zooplankton concentration 0 02 g c m 3 at the beginning of the year fig 6b c there is a small peak of toxic phytoplankton during spring however this suppresses zooplankton and helps non toxic phytoplankton to dominate for the rest of the year fig 5a therefore it is clear that summer is the ideal time for toxic phytoplankton to bloom and it needs certain concentrations of non toxic phytoplankton 0 12 p n 0 16 g c m 3 and zooplankton 0 02 g c m 3 4 discussion our study aimed to explore the potential role of harmful substances produced by toxic phytoplankton on herbivores and to investigate the feedback on phytoplankton dynamics particularly on the formation of habs inspired by the experimental observations of busch 2016 we incorporated the impact of harmful substances produced by the toxic species on the grazer by employing enhanced mortality of the grazer depending on the abundance of the harmful species in this specific experiment the observed impact on grazer mortality was mainly due to allelopathic substances our model is designed to be more general and applicable for the impact of both toxins and allelopathic substances on the consumer focusing on the direct toxic effects we found several consequences for the dynamics of the toxic blooms 4 1 model validation we compared simulated biomasses with empirical data to evaluate how well the model matches real ecosystems we chose the data for the allelopathic and toxin producing dinoflagellate alexandrium catenella associated with elevated shellfish toxicity from the highly productive central california coast during the summers of 2004 and 2005 a maximum a catenella concentration of 17 387 cells l 1 was measured at a nearshore site in monterey bay jester et al 2009 after converting cell densities to carbon mass by using 3000 pg c cell 1 blossom et al 2019 the peak a catenella concentration becomes 0 05 g c m 3 for another dense bloom forming ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate karlodinium veneficum which is known for its toxic effects on grazers and massive fish kills in several parts of the globe general bloom concentrations lie between 10 4 cells ml 1 and 10 5 cells ml 1 adolf et al 2007 hall et al 2008 converting to carbon mass using 120 pg carbon per cell brownlee et al 2008 the range turns into 1 2 g c m3 12 g c m 3 clearly our simulated range of the mean peak toxic phytoplankton concentrations 0 1 g c m 3 1 g c m 3 during toxic bloom events fig 4b lies within observed toxic phytoplankton bloom concentrations 0 05 g c m 3 12 g c m 3 in natural systems data from the gotland sea southern baltic sea show a range of biomasses of non toxic phytoplankton using 0 01 g chl g c 1 geider 1993 and zooplankton as 0 2 g c m 3 2 4 g c m 3 and 0 02 g c m 3 0 4 g c m 3 casini et al 2008 that match nicely with our simulated range 0 8 g c m 3 1 3 g c m 3 and 0 2 g c m 3 0 6 g c m 3 however these maximum bloom biomasses can vary between ecosystems depending on nutrient availability and other factors 4 2 effects of toxins on the system stability an increase in the strength of the toxic effect on zooplankton leads to a destabilization of the system i e first it shows limit cycle oscillations and finally exhibits chaotic oscillations at very high toxic effects a similar destabilizing role of toxic chemicals can be found in other models studying hab dynamics where toxic effects are characterized as one of the responsible factors for promoting habs chakraborty et al 2015 raw and mishra 2019 scotti et al 2015 by contrast a large number of modelling studies demonstrate a stabilizing role of toxic chemicals for system dynamics by diminishing oscillations in the system chattopadhayay et al 2002 jang et al 2014 mukhopadhyay and bhattacharyya 2006 interestingly toxic effects have also been found to have both stabilizing and destabilizing effects in a system depending on the strength of toxin production rate jang and allen 2015 the stability of a dynamical system depends on the positive and negative feedback loops generated due to interactions between different components of the system berryman and millstein 1989 the positive feedback processes e g reproduction cooperative behaviour interspecific competition lead to instability via exponential growth oscillation or chaotic behaviour whereas the negative feedback components e g predator numerical responses food depletion and recovery promote stability therefore a system becomes chaotic when the negative feedback is overcompensated and the system is continuously displaced into its positive feedback domain although it is argued that feedbacks are responsible for generating chaos in dynamic systems density dependence is central to the notion of chaos in ecology berryman and millstein 1989 the present study reveals that the growth suppression of zooplankton by toxic chemicals which depends on the concentration of toxic phytoplankton provides a growth advantage to both phytoplankton species and acts as a positive feedback that can result in chaotic oscillation in plankton systems additionally during the destabilization our system shows dangerously small population sizes there is a variety of mechanisms such as demographic stochasticity environmental stochasticity natural catastrophes genetic inbreeding edge effects the antirescue effect and the allee effect that threaten small populations by leading them to extinction e g lande 1988 pimm et al 1988 soulé 1987 analysis of real data and laboratory experiments also support the view that large fluctuations are severe enough to increase the likelihood of population extinction belovsky et al 1999 fagan et al 2001 however in the real world plankton populations are distributed over large spatial scales where several other mechanisms e g immigration prevent local population extinction hufbauer et al 2015 4 3 effects of toxins on bloom dynamics due to their inferior competitive ability for nutrients the toxic species is suppressed by its competitor and unable to reach high abundances in the absence of any selective predation by the grazer chakraborty and feudel 2014 selective feeding leading to a low preference for toxic phytoplankton by the grazer yields better growth conditions for toxic phytoplankton despite the higher growth rate of the non toxic species its abundance is significantly decreased due to high grazing pressure the presence of a simultaneous toxic effect shows surprising consequences for the bloom dynamics as the toxic species grows the negative effect sets in diminishing zooplankton abundance and subsequently decreasing the grazing pressure on both phytoplankton species consequently the non toxic species can recover and grow again and due to its superior competitive ability suppress the toxic species this indicates that toxin production which negatively affects the grazers does finally not pay off for a weak competitor for resources unless the grazer population shows selective predation in response to toxin production to provide a growth advantage to the toxic species toxins that affect the grazer directly provide an advantage to the species with higher competitive ability for nutrients therefore because of being the superior nutrient competitor non toxic phytoplankton obtain an advantage due to the direct toxic effect however during the initial phase of a bloom when nutrient conditions are not limiting selective predation rather than direct toxic effects plays an important role in bloom formation of toxin producing phytoplankton solé et al 2005 the direct toxic effect becomes important only when the abundance of toxic phytoplankton becomes significantly higher compared to their competitors and is able to compensate their competitive disadvantage although the toxic species obtains the competitive advantage only for a short time period as high toxic species abundance diminishes the grazer too heavily as a result the competitor is released from the grazing pressure and can increase in abundance again and finally outcompetes the toxic species however under natural conditions even at low average cell concentrations spatial variation in cell concentration may be high patches of increased a catenella cell numbers can occur when for instance cells are being transported onshore during relaxation favourable winds langlois and smith 2001 price et al 1991 and thus accumulate in shallow nearshore waters the formation of localized patches and thin layers which can also be observed for alexandrium spp in culture flasks grown under non turbulent conditions within which toxic phytoplankton can increase in cell numbers to abundances high enough to deter potential grazers and competitors by the accumulation of allelochemicals may therefore constitute a key factor for bloom initiation tillmann et al 2008 4 4 frequency and severity of habs at higher toxicity levels the emergence of habs becomes irregular in peak abundance and frequency while the non toxic species blooms regularly every year this irregularity of hab formation is purely deterministic and does not need any stochastic forcing therefore the results obtained in this model are novel and distinct from other studies which also aim at explaining irregularity in the emergence of habs bailey et al 2004 chakraborty and feudel 2014 freund et al 2006 while in other models irregularity is imposed due to a stochastic forcing such as fluctuations of temperature freund et al 2006 or grazer abundance chakraborty and feudel 2014 the mechanism presented here is solely based on nonlinear positive feedback between the abundance of the toxic species and the mortality of zooplankton due to toxins periodic variations in environmental factors were also found to result in pure deterministic irregular bloom dynamics chakraborty et al 2007 jang and allen 2015 however the presence of irregular blooms by toxic phytoplankton and regular annual blooms by non toxic phytoplankton in a single model makes the present study unique the irregular occurrence of habs in nature has been emphasized several times belgrano et al 1999 cardoso 2012 hotes and pearson 1977 padmakumar et al 2012 pick 2016 however only a few studies have specifically focused on the role of toxins on the emergence of irregularities in hab formation so far chakraborty and feudel 2014 showed that selective predation by grazers on different phytoplankton populations can yield irregularity in the occurrence of toxic phytoplankton blooms such selectivity in predation can also occur due to an indirect effect of toxin production waggett et al 2008 by contrast we investigate the role of a direct toxic effect on the grazer in the present study and the mechanisms of bloom formation are completely different from chakraborty and feudel 2014 our results show that an increase in toxicity results in the skipping of hab formation in some years while very strong toxic effects make hab events even rarer this is due to the fact that with increasing toxic effects the abundance of zooplankton becomes so low that this population needs a long recovery time and consequently habs disappear for a longer time period therefore toxic effects may not only be important for the toxic bloom dynamics in the same year but may also affect the bloom dynamics in subsequent years by contrast as the mean peak abundances and the variance of the peaks increase a strong toxic effect leads to habs with extremely large peak abundances in response to increasing irregularity in occurrence leading to a decreasing frequency of habs the co occurring species and grazers would not receive frequent challenges to respond to toxins so that they might lose the ability to select their prey and to develop a specific resistance which would make the impact of habs on these co occurring species more severe 4 5 seasonal succession of plankton plankton seasonal succession is generally considered as a series of transitions between different community states resulting from the internal dynamics of species replacements affected by external perturbations klausmeier and litchman 2012 the seasonal variation in nutrient concentration is known to shape the phytoplankton community and together with physical factors result in the seasonal succession pilkaityte and razinkovas 2007 in the present study the toxic effect on zooplankton plays the role of an indirect physical factor by affecting zooplankton negatively and results in different seasonal successional patterns for a certain range of the strength of toxicity our results demonstrate that a spring bloom of highly preferred non toxic phytoplankton is followed by a bloom of slow growing grazing resistant and toxin producing phytoplankton in the summer and finally another bloom of non toxic phytoplankton in the fall this kind of phytoplankton succession is very common in many lakes vanni and temte 1990 as well as in marine systems roden 1984 when the toxic effect becomes high toxic blooms sometimes can occur earlier in the season such early seasonal dominance of grazing resistant inferior competitors has been reported by deneke and nixdorf 1999 and klausmeier and litchman 2012 as well also the influence of allelopathic interactions among phytoplankton competitors on seasonal succession was previously observed by keating 1977 in a freshwater pond system 4 6 the generality of the model although the present study focuses on the role of dinoflagellate toxins that negatively affect grazers either by increasing mortality or reducing the growth rate and or reproduction rate of the grazer the model can also be applied to toxic cyanobacteria or any other phytoplankton species showing defence against predation the main criteria are that the organism should be an inferior competitor for resources and must have a direct negative effect on the grazer since many toxic cyanobacterial strains are weaker competitors than non toxic strains kardinaal et al 2007 our model can be applied to cyanobacteria dominated systems many species of phytoplankton which are weak competitors have evolved certain defensive traits that negatively affect grazers thus reducing predation pressure on the defended organisms for example due to the bioluminescent nature of some dinoflagellates buskey and swift 1983 the swimming behaviour of grazers gets disturbed resulting in reduced feeding efficiency of these organisms buskey et al 1983 buskey and swift 1983 at the same time flashes of light attract secondary predators that incur extra mortality on the grazer fleisher and case 1995 mesinger and case 1992 under nutrient limiting conditions the nutritional value of some phytoplankton decreases resulting in reduced ingestion rates by grazers cowles et al 1988 van donk and hessen 1993 and can simultaneously lead to a reduction in growth rates yoshida et al 2003 yoshida et al 2004 that can make that species a weak competitor therefore many other species apart from toxic dinoflagellates can also have the potential to form irregular blooms 4 7 future work validation of current theoretical results using field observations sets the stage for further work to this end separating diverse natural communities into functional groups would be the primary step to match with our model structure among different groups of phytoplankton some specific groups showing rare but recurrent success e g hab species need rigorous modelling studies supported by experimental data sets that include complex feedback between ecosystem components furthermore the current model can be extended by introducing several grazers and non toxic species with different sensitivities to toxins and allelopathic substances together with feedback from higher trophic level organisms roman and mccarthy 2010 another interesting future step would be to extend the model by incorporating horizontal movement either passive or active of nutrients phytoplankton and zooplankton as dispersal was shown to strongly affect hab competition and bloom dynamics along horizontal gradients e g purz et al 2021 the work on more complex models would provide further insights into this problem by revealing the effect of toxins on community level consequences it will also lead to a better and clearer understanding of the mechanisms for the initiation of such devastating events and will help to regulate local coastal habs or oceanic blooms of
