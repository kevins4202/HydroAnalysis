17205,foaming is a common operational problem in anaerobic digestion ad systems where hydrophobic filamentous microorganisms are usually considered to be the major cause however little is known about the identity of foam stabilising microorganisms in ad systems and control measures are lacking this study identified putative foam forming microorganisms in 13 full scale mesophilic digesters located at 11 wastewater treatment plants in denmark using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing with species level resolution and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish for visualization a foaming potential aeration test was applied to classify the digester sludges according to their foaming propensity a high foaming potential for sludges was linked to the abundance of species from the genus candidatus microthrix immigrating with the feed stream surplus activated sludge but also to several novel phylotypes potentially growing in the digester these species were classified to the genera ca brevefilum ca b fermentans and tetrasphaera midas s 5 the families st 12k33 midas s 22 and rikenellaceae midas s 141 and the archaeal genus methanospirillum midas s 2576 application of fish showed that these potential foam forming organisms all had a filamentous morphology additionally it was shown that concentrations of ammonium and total nitrogen correlated strongly to the presence of foam formers this study provided new insight into the identity of putative foam forming microorganisms in mesophilic ad systems allowing for the subsequent surveillance of their abundances and studies of their ecology such information will importantly inform the development of control measures for these problematic microorganisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion mesophilic foaming foam forming microorganism s microbial community structure 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an efficient microbial mediated biotechnological process for degrading organic materials to generate renewable energy biogas and for the stabilization of primary and surplus sludge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps narihiro and sekiguchi 2007 methane production in ad systems is accomplished by synergistic activities of several major metabolic groups including hydrolytic fermentative and proton reducing acetogenic bacteria and archaeal methanogens zinder and koch 1984 however the microbial communities in ads at wwtps are still poorly characterised and the functions of the predominantly uncultivated microorganisms are largely unknown kirkegaard et al 2017 rivière et al 2009 importantly the recent application of 16s rrna gene amplicon based community profiling of danish digesters at wwtps revealed that less than 5 of the operational taxonomic units otus 97 similarity cut off accounted for 80 of the total amplicon reads suggesting that a relatively low number of species are responsible for key processes and overall system performance kirkegaard et al 2017 mcilroy et al 2017a thus targeted detailed investigations of species linked to performance or operational problems may have generic value for our understanding of digesters at wwtps one common operational problem is the formation of foam in the upper part of the digester sludge which causes inefficient gas recovery digester breakage overflowing sludge blockages of gas mixing and fouling of gas collection pipes with ongoing maintenance costs ganidi et al 2009 kougias et al 2014 moeller and görsch 2015 pagilla et al 1997 westlund et al 1998 overgrowth of specific microorganisms theoretically leads to stable foam formation due to their hydrophobic cell surface and or possible production of surfactants petrovski et al 2011 soddell and seviour 1990 similarly to activated sludge as foaming biological causes are more common than chemical ones since foam produced by microorganisms is more viscous and stable di bella et al 2011 ganidi et al 2009 hence a good understanding of microbial communities and the identity of specific populations contributing to foam formation surfactant producing organisms and or hydrophobic organisms is needed for developing efficient control measures against foaming events in ads according to the literature filamentous bacteria from the genera ca microthrix and gordonia formerly nocardia both well known foam formers in as are primarily thought responsible for foaming events in mesophilic and thermophilic ad systems at wwtps see table 1 gordonia and ca microthrix likely enter the ads via surplus activated sludge and have the potential to survive under the anaerobic conditions found there for a few days andreasen and nielsen 2000 kirkegaard et al 2017 mcilroy et al 2013 putative foam formers in ads have routinely been identified and quantified by morphology based microscopic methods table 1 however today it is clear that these methods are unreliable and culture independent molecular approaches such as 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing should be applied recently nguyen et al 2019 and he et al 2017 applied 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to associate foam formation with several phylogenetically diverse microbes in ads treating wastewater sludge and food waste including members of the archaeal order methanosarcinales and the bacterial genera actinomyces corynebacterium and lactobacillus filamentous microorganisms belonging to the class anaerolineae phylum chloroflexi lee et al 2012 rivière et al 2009 candidate phylum ksb3 sekiguchi et al 2015 yamada et al 2007a and methane producing species in the genus methanothrix formerly methanosaeta albers and meyer 2011 demirel and scherer 2008 have also been linked to foaming incidents in ad systems thus it is likely that microbial groups other than ca microthrix and gordonia also play a role in foam formation in the ads at wwtps moreover the bacterial and archaeal communities are distinct for the thermophilic and mesophilic ads kirkegaard et al 2017 with the microorganisms responsible for foam formation likely to be unique to either system little is known about factors stimulating growth of foam formers in anaerobic digesters but some studies have indicated that organic overloading temperature fluctuations and inadequate mixing can be important ganidi et al 2011 2009 kougias et al 2013 kougias et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019 ross and ellis 1992 subramanian and pagilla 2014 moreover as vfas and n containing substances tend to accumulate during organic overloading monitoring of their concentrations has been suggested as an indirect indicator for potential foaming events boe et al 2012 he et al 2017 kougias et al 2013 moeller and görsch 2015 yenigün and demirel 2013 in our previous study a simple protocol for monitoring foam properties in digester sludge was proposed that classifies digester sludges into three groups based on their foaming properties non foaming unstable foam and foaming jiang et al 2018 here we have applied this method to assess the foaming potential of sludges from 13 mesophilic ads from 11 wwtps across denmark and related this property to the composition of their microbial community to identify putative foam formers in addition the physicochemical parameters associated with foaming events were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection parameters and storage sludge samples were obtained from mesophilic ads at danish wwtps transported overnight and analyzed immediately upon arrival in the laboratory physicochemical parameters such as total solids ts volatile solids vs ph total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and orthophosphate po4 3 were measured according to apha et al 2005 total volatile fatty acids tvfas were analyzed by hplc as described by hao et al 2020 all measurements were performed in triplicate samples were stored as 2 ml aliquots at 20 c for dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing for fish analyses diluted digester samples 1 4 in 1 phosphate buffered saline were fixed with 4 w v paraformaldehyde and stored in 50 v v ethanol 1 phosphate buffered saline solution at 20 c as previously described by daims et al 2005 2 2 foaming potential aeration test the foaming potential of digester sludge was measured using an aeration test developed previously jiang et al 2018 the apparatus was constructed from a plexiglass tube inner diameter of 3 cm height of 85 cm containing a diffuser stone attached to the bottom the flow rate of 500 ml min 10 min aeration time and digester sludge volume of 50 ml were selected for obtaining an appropriate foam height in this study foam height and stability measures were applied to describe the foaming potential of digester sludge maximum foam height during aeration hmax and foam height immediately after the aeration hafter were recorded the parameter of hmax hafter hmax after was used to evaluate the foam stability with a high hmax after value indicating low foam stability jiang et al 2018 2 3 bubble enrichment test for the identification of potential foam forming species to investigate if any microbial populations could be enriched in the bubble layer compared with digester sludge 19 digester samples taken from 11 danish wwtps in october 2016 march 2017 were tested at fixed ts value 20 g l the microbial community of both digester sludge and bubble layer samples collected during the foaming potential test were analyzed the physicochemical parameters of digester sludge are presented in table s1 the supernatant of sludge or condensed biomass from the same sample was applied for adjusting ts 2 4 sludge foaming potential classification digester sludges were classified into three groups non foaming unstable foam and foaming by our previously described foaming potential test at various ts concentrations 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 g l jiang et al 2018 for this analysis ad sludges were sampled from 13 mesophilic ads at 11 wwtps in february december 2016 the supernatant of sludge or condensed biomass from the same sample was applied for adjusting ts dna was extracted from each sample for subsequent community composition profiling via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 2 5 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing dna was extracted from 50 µl aliquots of ad samples with the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the standard protocol except for a fourfold increase in the duration of the bead beating step albertsen et al 2015 the dna concentration was examined using the qubit dsdna br assay thermo fisher scientific usa on an infinite m200 pro tecan switzerland plate reader the library preparation protocol for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing targeting bacteria and archaea was described by kirkegaard et al 2017 the bacterial primers used were 27f agagtttgatcctggctcag and 534r attaccgcggctgctgg which amplify a dna fragment of 500 bp of the 16s rrna gene variable regions 1 3 the archaeal primers used were 340f ccctahggggygcasca and 915r gwgcycccccgycaattc which amplify a dna fragment of 560 bp of the 16s rrna gene variable regions 3 5 all pcr reactions were run in duplicate and pooled afterward library concentration was measured with qubit dsdna hs assay thermo fisher scientific usa and the quality validated with a tapestation 2200 using d1000 screentapes agilent usa the bacteria and archaea amplicon libraries were pooled separately and paired end sequenced 2 300 bp on the illumina miseq using reagent kit v3 a 10 20 phix control library was added to mitigate low diversity library effects 2 6 bioinformatic processing of amplicon data the bacterial and archaeal raw reads were processed separately by usearch v 11 0 667 edgar 2016 for v1 3 filter phix fastx truncate trunclen 250 and fastq filter with fastq maxee 1 0 were applied to filter the raw fastq files for phix sequences trimmed to 250 bp and quality filtered to dereplicate the sequences fastx uniques with sizeout relabel uniq was used amplicon sequence variants asvs were generated using unoise3 edgar 2016 and asv tables were created by mapping the raw reads to the asvs using otutab with the zotus and strand both options taxonomy was assigned using sintax with the strand both and sintax cutoff 0 8 for v3 5 the amplicon data were analyzed in the same way except that only the reverse read was used and the primer binding site was removed during the trimming using fastx truncate stripleft 18 trunclen 250 in this study we used the autotax based midas 3 reference database dueholm et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2020 to assign the taxonomy which is a comprehensive ecosystem specific reference database for activated sludge and anaerobic digesters with species level taxonomic resolution 2 7 data processing and statistical analyses all the downstream processing of sequence data utilized the r environment v3 6 2 r development core team 2017 and qiime v1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 samples were randomly subsampled to 19 078 and 5 452 sequences for bacteria and archaea respectively using qiime script single rarefaction py no sample was filtered after rarefaction analysis of beta diversity was performed by calculating the pairwise weighted unifrac lozupone and knight 2005 distance between each pair of samples qiime s beta diversity py script and the resulting distance matrix was used for all downstream statistical tests of sample similarity the significance of sample groupings was assessed using anosim compare categories py for categorical variables with 999 permutations of the randomized data set heat maps and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were performed to compare microbial profiles for dissimilarities using the r package ampvis2 v2 5 8 albertsen et al 2015 differential abundance of asvs between sample groups was conducted with r package deseq2 v1 26 0 love et al 2014 pearson tests were performed using the r package hmisc v4 3 0 harreii and dupont 2018 to identify correlations between the abundance of microorganisms and foam heights which were visualized with the r package corrplot v0 84 fdr p 0 05 wei and simko 2017 the correlation between physicochemical parameters and the microbial community structure was analyzed utilizing canonical correspondence analysis cca from the ampvis2 v2 5 8 r package 2 8 fish fish was performed as described by daims et al 2005 probes were applied with the competitors and helpers at the stringency conditions given in their original publications see table 2 the non eub nonsense probe was used as a negative hybridization control wallner et al 1993 microscopy was performed with either an axioskop epifluorescence microscope carl zeiss oberkochen germany or a white light laser confocal microscope leica tcs sp8 x fitted with a 405 nm diode laser leica microsystems kista sweden 2 9 data availability the raw amplicon sequencing reads have been deposited in ncbi under the bioproject accession number prjna645373 3 results 3 1 assessment of the ability to identify foam forming microorganisms by their enrichment during foaming potential tests according to the theoretical role of microbial cells in foam formation in ads the cells of species responsible should become enriched in the foam layer given the difficulty in sampling foam from inside an operational ad we used amplicon 16s rrna gene community profiling to identify potential foam forming microorganisms by their enrichment in the bubble layer produced during our foaming potential test of 19 sampled ad sludges table s1 at the time of sampling foaming was reported to be occurring within the full scale digesters at mariagerfjord esbjerg vest and egaa noting that plant operators are not always aware that foaming is occurring consistent with these observations mariagerfjord had the highest foam height with high stability hmax after followed by søholt esbjerg vest rt1b and esbjerg vest rt2b figure s1 surprisingly the amplicon sequencing data showed very similar community profiles for the digester sludge and the bubble layer sampled during the foaming test for each plant figure s2 for bacteria figure s3 for archaea no asv showed significantly higher abundances in the bubble layer sample compared with digester sludge deseq2 log fold difference with an adjusted fdr p value of 0 05 figure s4 furthermore an nmds plot of weighted unifrac distances figure s5a showed that the bacterial communities of all samples were distinct anosim r 0 095 p 0 001 and that cross sample variation was higher than differences between digester sludge and bubble layer samples anosim r 0 087 p 0 032 the archaeal profiles were even more similar between the digester sludge and bubble layer figure s5b anosim r 0 004 p 0 49 in general the results suggested that this approach was not suitable for the enrichment and subsequent identification of potential foam formers 3 2 correlating the abundance of microbial species with ad sludge foaming potential 3 2 1 classification of digester sludge by their foaming potential in order to identify potential foam forming microorganisms in full scale ad systems sampled sludges were first classified according to their foaming propensity using our previously described method jiang et al 2018 for this method the foaming propensity of a sludge is based on values for hmax hafter and hmax after given foam formation is strongly influenced by ts which varies for danish ad sludges 10 50 g l the tests were carried out at various ts concentrations figure s6 the physicochemical parameters of the 13 digester sludges are presented in table 3 foaming was reported on site for mariagerfjord and esbjerg vest rt2b sludges from viborg rt1 randers rt1 randers rt2 slagelse rt1 hjørring and avedøre rt1 were classified as non foaming group 1 hmax 200 mm at all ts concentrations figure s6 samples from søholt damhusaaen rt1 and esbjerg vest rt1a had high foam height and low foam stability corresponding to unstable foam group 2 hmax 200 mm and hmax after 200 mm at some of ts concentrations figure s6 sludges from mariagerfjord and esbjerg vest rt2b exhibited the same high foam height as those of group 2 but with higher foam stability and were classified as foaming group 3 hmax 200 mm at some ts concentrations and hmax after 200 mm at all ts concentrations red lines in figure s6 while the identification of non foaming group 1 versus foaming sludge groups 2 and 3 is clear the cut off between groups 2 and 3 is somewhat arbitrary however these groups were putatively defined to provide a standard classification system for the purpose of subsequent analyses further experience in the application of our foaming potential test for ad surveillance will likely allow refinement of these cut off values 3 2 2 microbial community composition analyses the 25 most abundant bacterial asvs across all the sampled ad sludges are displayed in figure 1 asv23 of ca brevefilum fermentans was in relatively higher abundances in sludges classified to groups 2 søholt 9 2 and 3 ejby mølle 9 mariagerfjord 8 5 compared to those of the non foaming group 1 0 0 4 additionally the well known foam former ca microthrix midas s 2 asv5 was also in higher abundances in group 3 sludges 1 5 3 1 of the reads except ejby mølle relative to group 1 and 2 sludges 0 1 0 8 other asvs also appeared to be enriched in group 3 sludges including asv125 of midas s 156 family anaerolineaceae esbjerg vest rt2b 5 4 and the asv64 of midas s 141 family rikenellaceae fornæs 4 5 mariagerfjord 8 8 in contrast several asvs were associated with group 1 sludges including asv80 of ca fermentibacter daniensis phylum fermentibacteriota and asv128 of thermoanaerobaculum phylum acidobacteria the nmds plot of weighted unifrac distances figure 2 a showed the bacterial communities of groups 1 and 3 differed significantly anosim r 0 56 p 0 006 and separated along the second axis there was also significant difference between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 together anosim r 0 26 p 0 024 there was no significant difference identified when the bacterial communities of group 1 were compared to group 2 anosim r 0 37 p 0 063 or when group 2 were compared to group 3 anosim r 0 31 p 0 97 differential abundance analysis revealed six asvs enriched in group 3 relative to group 1 according to the deseq2 log fold difference with an adjusted fdr p value of 0 05 figure 2 c we reasoned that comparative statistical analysis of the microbial communities of non foaming group 1 and foaming groups 2 and 3 sludges could reveal surfactant producing organisms figure s7a and subsequent comparisons between the communities of sludges producing unstable group 2 and stable group 3 foams could identify the hydrophobic organisms responsible for stabilizing the foams figure s7b based on these hypotheses among the top 25 most abundant bacterial asvs figure 1 those classified to ca brevefilum fermentans asv23 midas s 22 family st 12k33 asv173 midas s 5 tetrasphaera asv1 and midas s 301 genus ca cloacimonas asv187 might represent surfactant producing organisms and those classified to midas s 2 genus ca microthrix asv5 and midas s 141 family rikenellaceae asv64 potentially represent hydrophobic organisms conversely some asvs were associated with group 1 such as asv128 genus thermoanaerobaculum among the archaea genus methanothrix was dominant in all samples 41 9 77 8 of the archaeal reads figure s8 the second most abundant methanogen methanolinea was clearly more abundant in group 1 13 8 26 of the reads with the exception of hjørring at 0 1 than group 3 0 3 of the reads the archaeal communities of all plants sampled were less distinct from each other relative to the cross plant variation observed for bacterial communities as shown in the nmds plot based on weighted unifrac distances figure 2 b anosim r 0 154 p 0 14 as with the bacterial community analyses there was significant differences between the archaeal communities of group 1 and 3 sludges anosim r 0 38 p 0 016 also we did observe the significant enrichment of two members classified to the genus methanomethylovorans asv9 and the family methanoregulaceae asv19 in group 3 sludges figure 2 d figure s9 but each was abundant in only a single plant asv9 in ejby mølle and asv19 in fornæs based on the hypotheses outlined earlier statistical analysis indicates that members affiliated to the genus methanospirillum asv8 may be surfactant producing and hydrophobic organisms figure s7c s7d 3 2 3 pearson correlations between microorganisms and foam height pearson correlation analyses were performed to visualize possible relationships between the top 65 abundant microorganisms 50 bacteria and 15 archaea and foam heights with all samples in both the preliminary bubble enrichment test and the foaming classification experiment figure s10 s11 this analysis revealed some positive relationships among certain asvs and foam heights fdr p 0 05 such as asv173 family st 12k33 midas s 22 and asv1 genus tetrasphaera midas s 5 in addition asv173 showed positive correlation with asv23 ca brevefilum fermentans in both experiments and there were also positive relationships between asv64 family rikenellaceae midas s 141 and asv8 genus methanospirillum midas s 2576 these four species all grow in the digesters jiang et al 2020 there was also a positive relationship between species coming with surplus activated sludge asv5 genus ca microthrix midas s 2 and asv9 genus dechloromonas midas s 96 although the latter did not cause foaming 3 2 4 visualization of potential foam formers by fish fish was applied to confirm the relative abundance morphology and spatial arrangement of potential foam forming populations selected from those identified with the 16s rrna gene amplicon surveys these populations included ca brevefilum fermentans midas s 5 genus tetrasphaera midas s 141 family rikenellaceae midas s 22 family st 12k33 midas s 2 genus ca microthrix and species in the methanospirillum in mariagerfjord sludge samples cells of the genus ca brevefilum targeted by the cfx a6 mix probe appeared as short filaments approx 3 8 0 4 µm in size dispersed throughout the flocs figure 3 a these organisms were also observed at lengths of approx 50 μm in samples from søholt and fredericia figure 3 b tetrasphaera populations tetra183 and tetra617 probe mix in sludge from esbjerg vest 1a both hybridized with different morphologies including small micro colonies of cocci and filaments with a diameter of approx 0 8 μm figure 3 c as reported before ca microthrix mcx840 probe appeared as thin bent filaments with a diameter of approx 0 6 μm and a length of often up to 100 μm figure 3 d the cf319a phylum level probe was used to target members of midas g 141 phylotype phylum bacteroidetes due to lack of species specific gene probe for this population this probe hybridized to relatively abundant filaments approx 1 2 μm thick and 100 μm long figure 3 e and distributed throughout the flocs in both the egaa and mariagerfjord sludges the genus methanospirillum mg1200b probe was observed in sludge from mariagerfjord as short filamentous morphology approx 0 7 μm wide and 8 μm long figure 3 f consistent with the morphology reported for other phylotypes of the genus ferry et al 1974 iino et al 2010 parshina et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 3 3 correlations between physicochemical parameters and microbial community structure several of the physicochemical parameters varied between digesters such as ts 15 45 g l and nh4 n concentration 249 to 1745 mg l table 3 the nh4 n concentrations were all below the suggested ad inhibition cut off level of approx 5000 mg l of nh4 n parameswaran and rittmann 2012 also the tvfa values were far below the suggested cut off concentration for stable plant operation 50 70 mm ahring et al 1995 ferrer et al 2010 to explore relationships between the ad plant physicochemical parameters ph nh4 tn po4 3 tvfas and microbial community structure of digester sludge canonical correspondence analysis cca was performed the concentrations of nh4 and tn were significantly correlated with the distribution of the three foaming propensity sludge groupings both for the bacterial figure 4 a p 0 05 and archaeal communities figure 4 b p 0 05 4 discussion many studies have evaluated the foaming potential of anaerobic digester sludge and suggested microorganisms potentially responsible for foam formation but these associations have not been supported by statistical evidence ganidi et al 2011 subramanian et al 2015 subramanian and pagilla 2014 furthermore the identification of the microorganisms was often based on unreliable morphological characteristics see table 1 here we have applied a standard foam potential test 16s rrna gene based community analyses and fish confirmation of morphology and abundance to establish statistically significant links between the foaming potential of mesophilic digester sludge and putative foam forming microorganisms in contrast to activated sludge systems the closed anaerobic digester tanks make it difficult to observe and monitor foaming events complicating efforts for their prevention and control our proposed foaming potential test is a simple method for monitoring the general foaming propensity of ad sludges in support of our approach verified foaming events at mariagerfjord and esbjerg vest rt2b were consistent with the classification of these sludge to group 3 foaming sludge in contrast to expectations no abundant species were significantly enriched in the bubble layer formed during the foam propensity test in the preliminary bubble enrichment experiment this may be due to the short aeration time or floccular nature of the biomass where microorganisms not contributing to foam formation are still enriched due to their physical association with those that are as an alternate approach we applied a community profiling to identify the enrichment of potential foam formers in digester sludge with high foaming propensity the significant differences in bacterial community structure between non foaming group 1 and foaming group 3 sludges supported the suggestion that the community composition influenced the foaming properties of the sludge moreover differential abundance analysis identified potential roles for asvs with those enriched in sludge producing foams groups 2 and 3 suggested to produce surfactants and those enriched in sludges forming stable foams group 3 potentially having hydrophobic cell surfaces that contribute to stabilizing the foam group 3 in support of these conclusions ca microthrix was observed to be enriched in group 3 foaming sludges and is known to have a hydrophobic cell surface in situ nielsen et al 2002 archaeal species midas s 2576 genus methanospirillum asv8 potentially produces surfactants and is also known to have a hydrophobic cell wall in addition statistically significant relationships between asvs belonging to the species ca b fermentans midas s 22 family st 12k33 asv173 and tetrasphaera midas s 5 and the foaming propensity and or height were identified these observations indicate the potential importance of these phylotypes to foam formation in mesophilic ads for the first time very little is known of the ecophysiology of these putative foam forming organisms a culture independent study revealed that members of the uncultured genus ca brevefilum are fermentative chemoorganoheterotrophs with a filamentous morphology mcilroy et al 2017b these observations are consistent with the findings from other species belonging to the family anaerolineaceae in anaerobic digester systems sekiguchi et al 2003 sun et al 2016 yamada et al 2007b 2006 interestingly the asvs of ca b fermentans were found to be positively related with asv10 family methanoregulaceae figure s11 indicating a potential for parallel growth of these microorganisms physical association of the ca b fermentans with methanothrix was observed with fish previously mcilroy et al 2017b suggesting that the former genus may form symbiotic relationships with a range of methanogens members of the genera tetrasphaera and ca microthrix are well known and abundant in danish full scale wastewater treatment plants designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and are fed into ad systems with the influent where they may persist but are unlikely to grow jiang et al 2020 kirkegaard et al 2017 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the tetrasphaera species have diverse physiology including a capability for fermentative growth and intracellular accumulation of fermentation by products and amino acids kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 while the ca microthrix are involved in lipid metabolism mcilroy et al 2013 nothing is known of the physiology of midas s 22 and midas s 141 which are classified to the family st 12k33 and rikenellaceae respectively the only studied isolate in these two families belonging to the genus blvii28 wastewater sludge group suggests that they are anaerobic chemoorganotrophs that ferment carbohydrates su et al 2014 the details of the potential relationships between the ca b fermentans midas s 22 midas s 141 and methanospirillum are worth further investigation and the development of control measures for these putative foam forming organisms will importantly require further studies of their physiology and ecology archaea have previous been linked to foaming events or settling problems in anaerobic digester systems yamada et al 2007a members of the genus methanothrix have previously been suggested as the primary archaeal candidates they are commonly observed in mesophilic uasb reactors and digester sludge and are known to possess a filamentous morphology and hydrophobic cell surface daffonchio et al 1995 dueholm et al 2015 grotenhuis et al 1992 however they were also observed to be the dominant methanogens in both foaming and non foaming mesophilic digesters at danish wwtps jiang et al 2020 with no significant correlation to the foaming propensity of samples analyzed in this study recently foaming issues in ad systems co digesting wastewater sludge and food waste were also linked to archaea with members from the class methanomicrobia reportedly enriched in the top foaming layer nguyen et al 2019 our study revealed that members of the genus methanospirillum class methanomicrobia were filamentous and were enriched in foaming sludge from mariagerfjord members of the methanospirillum have previously been reported to have filamentous morphology ferry et al 1974 iino et al 2010 parshina et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 but not a hydrophobic cell surface grotenhuis et al 1992 however a recent study has revealed that this genus has an amyloidic sheath structure that is usually hydrophobic christensen et al 2018 little is known about the causes of most foaming events in full scale ads our study indicates that the microorganisms responsible are both phylogenetically and physiologically diverse complicating our understanding of the operational conditions that lead to microbial mediated foaming in addition our ability to prevent or control foaming needs to also consider the conditions of the activated sludge system feeding the anaerobic digester given the identified role of immigrating species such as ca microthrix in foam formation in both systems our analyses of ad systems suggest that ammonium concentration strongly correlated to the microbial community structure and the foaming potential of sludge this is consistent with findings by he et al 2017 who showed that foaming in food waste digesters could be induced by ammonia inhibition however the ammonium concentration ranges were very different in the two studies 441 1324 mg l in our reactors and 900 4500 mg l in theirs and other factors could also be of importance e g specific substrates or the mode of loading 5 conclusion a comprehensive investigation of putative foam forming microorganisms in mesophilic ads treating surplus activated sludge was performed with 16s rrna gene amplicon and fish based microbial community analyses significant differences were observed between the microbial communities of non foaming and foaming mesophilic digesters consistent with the findings of previous studies species from genus ca microthrix coming from the surplus activated sludge were frequently associated with foaming in addition several novel species level phylotypes potentially growing in the digester were enriched in sludges with a high foaming propensity indicating their potential role in foam formation including members of the genera ca brevefilum ca b fermentans the families st 12k33 midas s 22 and rikenellaceae midas s 141 and the archaeal genus methanospirillum midas s 2576 we suggest that the proliferation of these species can be used as early warning indicators for foaming events moreover increased concentrations of ammonium and tn were found to be positively correlated with the foaming propensity of sludges further full scale studies are needed to find potential control measures for putative foam forming populations and to assess their value along with other physical parameters as early warning indicators of imminent foaming events overall this study identified several new putative foam forming microorganisms in mesophilic ad systems allowing for the subsequent surveillance of their abundances and studies of their ecology that will importantly inform the development of

17205,foaming is a common operational problem in anaerobic digestion ad systems where hydrophobic filamentous microorganisms are usually considered to be the major cause however little is known about the identity of foam stabilising microorganisms in ad systems and control measures are lacking this study identified putative foam forming microorganisms in 13 full scale mesophilic digesters located at 11 wastewater treatment plants in denmark using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing with species level resolution and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish for visualization a foaming potential aeration test was applied to classify the digester sludges according to their foaming propensity a high foaming potential for sludges was linked to the abundance of species from the genus candidatus microthrix immigrating with the feed stream surplus activated sludge but also to several novel phylotypes potentially growing in the digester these species were classified to the genera ca brevefilum ca b fermentans and tetrasphaera midas s 5 the families st 12k33 midas s 22 and rikenellaceae midas s 141 and the archaeal genus methanospirillum midas s 2576 application of fish showed that these potential foam forming organisms all had a filamentous morphology additionally it was shown that concentrations of ammonium and total nitrogen correlated strongly to the presence of foam formers this study provided new insight into the identity of putative foam forming microorganisms in mesophilic ad systems allowing for the subsequent surveillance of their abundances and studies of their ecology such information will importantly inform the development of control measures for these problematic microorganisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion mesophilic foaming foam forming microorganism s microbial community structure 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad is an efficient microbial mediated biotechnological process for degrading organic materials to generate renewable energy biogas and for the stabilization of primary and surplus sludge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps narihiro and sekiguchi 2007 methane production in ad systems is accomplished by synergistic activities of several major metabolic groups including hydrolytic fermentative and proton reducing acetogenic bacteria and archaeal methanogens zinder and koch 1984 however the microbial communities in ads at wwtps are still poorly characterised and the functions of the predominantly uncultivated microorganisms are largely unknown kirkegaard et al 2017 rivière et al 2009 importantly the recent application of 16s rrna gene amplicon based community profiling of danish digesters at wwtps revealed that less than 5 of the operational taxonomic units otus 97 similarity cut off accounted for 80 of the total amplicon reads suggesting that a relatively low number of species are responsible for key processes and overall system performance kirkegaard et al 2017 mcilroy et al 2017a thus targeted detailed investigations of species linked to performance or operational problems may have generic value for our understanding of digesters at wwtps one common operational problem is the formation of foam in the upper part of the digester sludge which causes inefficient gas recovery digester breakage overflowing sludge blockages of gas mixing and fouling of gas collection pipes with ongoing maintenance costs ganidi et al 2009 kougias et al 2014 moeller and görsch 2015 pagilla et al 1997 westlund et al 1998 overgrowth of specific microorganisms theoretically leads to stable foam formation due to their hydrophobic cell surface and or possible production of surfactants petrovski et al 2011 soddell and seviour 1990 similarly to activated sludge as foaming biological causes are more common than chemical ones since foam produced by microorganisms is more viscous and stable di bella et al 2011 ganidi et al 2009 hence a good understanding of microbial communities and the identity of specific populations contributing to foam formation surfactant producing organisms and or hydrophobic organisms is needed for developing efficient control measures against foaming events in ads according to the literature filamentous bacteria from the genera ca microthrix and gordonia formerly nocardia both well known foam formers in as are primarily thought responsible for foaming events in mesophilic and thermophilic ad systems at wwtps see table 1 gordonia and ca microthrix likely enter the ads via surplus activated sludge and have the potential to survive under the anaerobic conditions found there for a few days andreasen and nielsen 2000 kirkegaard et al 2017 mcilroy et al 2013 putative foam formers in ads have routinely been identified and quantified by morphology based microscopic methods table 1 however today it is clear that these methods are unreliable and culture independent molecular approaches such as 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing should be applied recently nguyen et al 2019 and he et al 2017 applied 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to associate foam formation with several phylogenetically diverse microbes in ads treating wastewater sludge and food waste including members of the archaeal order methanosarcinales and the bacterial genera actinomyces corynebacterium and lactobacillus filamentous microorganisms belonging to the class anaerolineae phylum chloroflexi lee et al 2012 rivière et al 2009 candidate phylum ksb3 sekiguchi et al 2015 yamada et al 2007a and methane producing species in the genus methanothrix formerly methanosaeta albers and meyer 2011 demirel and scherer 2008 have also been linked to foaming incidents in ad systems thus it is likely that microbial groups other than ca microthrix and gordonia also play a role in foam formation in the ads at wwtps moreover the bacterial and archaeal communities are distinct for the thermophilic and mesophilic ads kirkegaard et al 2017 with the microorganisms responsible for foam formation likely to be unique to either system little is known about factors stimulating growth of foam formers in anaerobic digesters but some studies have indicated that organic overloading temperature fluctuations and inadequate mixing can be important ganidi et al 2011 2009 kougias et al 2013 kougias et al 2014 nguyen et al 2019 ross and ellis 1992 subramanian and pagilla 2014 moreover as vfas and n containing substances tend to accumulate during organic overloading monitoring of their concentrations has been suggested as an indirect indicator for potential foaming events boe et al 2012 he et al 2017 kougias et al 2013 moeller and görsch 2015 yenigün and demirel 2013 in our previous study a simple protocol for monitoring foam properties in digester sludge was proposed that classifies digester sludges into three groups based on their foaming properties non foaming unstable foam and foaming jiang et al 2018 here we have applied this method to assess the foaming potential of sludges from 13 mesophilic ads from 11 wwtps across denmark and related this property to the composition of their microbial community to identify putative foam formers in addition the physicochemical parameters associated with foaming events were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection parameters and storage sludge samples were obtained from mesophilic ads at danish wwtps transported overnight and analyzed immediately upon arrival in the laboratory physicochemical parameters such as total solids ts volatile solids vs ph total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and orthophosphate po4 3 were measured according to apha et al 2005 total volatile fatty acids tvfas were analyzed by hplc as described by hao et al 2020 all measurements were performed in triplicate samples were stored as 2 ml aliquots at 20 c for dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing for fish analyses diluted digester samples 1 4 in 1 phosphate buffered saline were fixed with 4 w v paraformaldehyde and stored in 50 v v ethanol 1 phosphate buffered saline solution at 20 c as previously described by daims et al 2005 2 2 foaming potential aeration test the foaming potential of digester sludge was measured using an aeration test developed previously jiang et al 2018 the apparatus was constructed from a plexiglass tube inner diameter of 3 cm height of 85 cm containing a diffuser stone attached to the bottom the flow rate of 500 ml min 10 min aeration time and digester sludge volume of 50 ml were selected for obtaining an appropriate foam height in this study foam height and stability measures were applied to describe the foaming potential of digester sludge maximum foam height during aeration hmax and foam height immediately after the aeration hafter were recorded the parameter of hmax hafter hmax after was used to evaluate the foam stability with a high hmax after value indicating low foam stability jiang et al 2018 2 3 bubble enrichment test for the identification of potential foam forming species to investigate if any microbial populations could be enriched in the bubble layer compared with digester sludge 19 digester samples taken from 11 danish wwtps in october 2016 march 2017 were tested at fixed ts value 20 g l the microbial community of both digester sludge and bubble layer samples collected during the foaming potential test were analyzed the physicochemical parameters of digester sludge are presented in table s1 the supernatant of sludge or condensed biomass from the same sample was applied for adjusting ts 2 4 sludge foaming potential classification digester sludges were classified into three groups non foaming unstable foam and foaming by our previously described foaming potential test at various ts concentrations 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 g l jiang et al 2018 for this analysis ad sludges were sampled from 13 mesophilic ads at 11 wwtps in february december 2016 the supernatant of sludge or condensed biomass from the same sample was applied for adjusting ts dna was extracted from each sample for subsequent community composition profiling via 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 2 5 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing dna was extracted from 50 µl aliquots of ad samples with the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa following the standard protocol except for a fourfold increase in the duration of the bead beating step albertsen et al 2015 the dna concentration was examined using the qubit dsdna br assay thermo fisher scientific usa on an infinite m200 pro tecan switzerland plate reader the library preparation protocol for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing targeting bacteria and archaea was described by kirkegaard et al 2017 the bacterial primers used were 27f agagtttgatcctggctcag and 534r attaccgcggctgctgg which amplify a dna fragment of 500 bp of the 16s rrna gene variable regions 1 3 the archaeal primers used were 340f ccctahggggygcasca and 915r gwgcycccccgycaattc which amplify a dna fragment of 560 bp of the 16s rrna gene variable regions 3 5 all pcr reactions were run in duplicate and pooled afterward library concentration was measured with qubit dsdna hs assay thermo fisher scientific usa and the quality validated with a tapestation 2200 using d1000 screentapes agilent usa the bacteria and archaea amplicon libraries were pooled separately and paired end sequenced 2 300 bp on the illumina miseq using reagent kit v3 a 10 20 phix control library was added to mitigate low diversity library effects 2 6 bioinformatic processing of amplicon data the bacterial and archaeal raw reads were processed separately by usearch v 11 0 667 edgar 2016 for v1 3 filter phix fastx truncate trunclen 250 and fastq filter with fastq maxee 1 0 were applied to filter the raw fastq files for phix sequences trimmed to 250 bp and quality filtered to dereplicate the sequences fastx uniques with sizeout relabel uniq was used amplicon sequence variants asvs were generated using unoise3 edgar 2016 and asv tables were created by mapping the raw reads to the asvs using otutab with the zotus and strand both options taxonomy was assigned using sintax with the strand both and sintax cutoff 0 8 for v3 5 the amplicon data were analyzed in the same way except that only the reverse read was used and the primer binding site was removed during the trimming using fastx truncate stripleft 18 trunclen 250 in this study we used the autotax based midas 3 reference database dueholm et al 2019 nierychlo et al 2020 to assign the taxonomy which is a comprehensive ecosystem specific reference database for activated sludge and anaerobic digesters with species level taxonomic resolution 2 7 data processing and statistical analyses all the downstream processing of sequence data utilized the r environment v3 6 2 r development core team 2017 and qiime v1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 samples were randomly subsampled to 19 078 and 5 452 sequences for bacteria and archaea respectively using qiime script single rarefaction py no sample was filtered after rarefaction analysis of beta diversity was performed by calculating the pairwise weighted unifrac lozupone and knight 2005 distance between each pair of samples qiime s beta diversity py script and the resulting distance matrix was used for all downstream statistical tests of sample similarity the significance of sample groupings was assessed using anosim compare categories py for categorical variables with 999 permutations of the randomized data set heat maps and non metric multidimensional scaling nmds were performed to compare microbial profiles for dissimilarities using the r package ampvis2 v2 5 8 albertsen et al 2015 differential abundance of asvs between sample groups was conducted with r package deseq2 v1 26 0 love et al 2014 pearson tests were performed using the r package hmisc v4 3 0 harreii and dupont 2018 to identify correlations between the abundance of microorganisms and foam heights which were visualized with the r package corrplot v0 84 fdr p 0 05 wei and simko 2017 the correlation between physicochemical parameters and the microbial community structure was analyzed utilizing canonical correspondence analysis cca from the ampvis2 v2 5 8 r package 2 8 fish fish was performed as described by daims et al 2005 probes were applied with the competitors and helpers at the stringency conditions given in their original publications see table 2 the non eub nonsense probe was used as a negative hybridization control wallner et al 1993 microscopy was performed with either an axioskop epifluorescence microscope carl zeiss oberkochen germany or a white light laser confocal microscope leica tcs sp8 x fitted with a 405 nm diode laser leica microsystems kista sweden 2 9 data availability the raw amplicon sequencing reads have been deposited in ncbi under the bioproject accession number prjna645373 3 results 3 1 assessment of the ability to identify foam forming microorganisms by their enrichment during foaming potential tests according to the theoretical role of microbial cells in foam formation in ads the cells of species responsible should become enriched in the foam layer given the difficulty in sampling foam from inside an operational ad we used amplicon 16s rrna gene community profiling to identify potential foam forming microorganisms by their enrichment in the bubble layer produced during our foaming potential test of 19 sampled ad sludges table s1 at the time of sampling foaming was reported to be occurring within the full scale digesters at mariagerfjord esbjerg vest and egaa noting that plant operators are not always aware that foaming is occurring consistent with these observations mariagerfjord had the highest foam height with high stability hmax after followed by søholt esbjerg vest rt1b and esbjerg vest rt2b figure s1 surprisingly the amplicon sequencing data showed very similar community profiles for the digester sludge and the bubble layer sampled during the foaming test for each plant figure s2 for bacteria figure s3 for archaea no asv showed significantly higher abundances in the bubble layer sample compared with digester sludge deseq2 log fold difference with an adjusted fdr p value of 0 05 figure s4 furthermore an nmds plot of weighted unifrac distances figure s5a showed that the bacterial communities of all samples were distinct anosim r 0 095 p 0 001 and that cross sample variation was higher than differences between digester sludge and bubble layer samples anosim r 0 087 p 0 032 the archaeal profiles were even more similar between the digester sludge and bubble layer figure s5b anosim r 0 004 p 0 49 in general the results suggested that this approach was not suitable for the enrichment and subsequent identification of potential foam formers 3 2 correlating the abundance of microbial species with ad sludge foaming potential 3 2 1 classification of digester sludge by their foaming potential in order to identify potential foam forming microorganisms in full scale ad systems sampled sludges were first classified according to their foaming propensity using our previously described method jiang et al 2018 for this method the foaming propensity of a sludge is based on values for hmax hafter and hmax after given foam formation is strongly influenced by ts which varies for danish ad sludges 10 50 g l the tests were carried out at various ts concentrations figure s6 the physicochemical parameters of the 13 digester sludges are presented in table 3 foaming was reported on site for mariagerfjord and esbjerg vest rt2b sludges from viborg rt1 randers rt1 randers rt2 slagelse rt1 hjørring and avedøre rt1 were classified as non foaming group 1 hmax 200 mm at all ts concentrations figure s6 samples from søholt damhusaaen rt1 and esbjerg vest rt1a had high foam height and low foam stability corresponding to unstable foam group 2 hmax 200 mm and hmax after 200 mm at some of ts concentrations figure s6 sludges from mariagerfjord and esbjerg vest rt2b exhibited the same high foam height as those of group 2 but with higher foam stability and were classified as foaming group 3 hmax 200 mm at some ts concentrations and hmax after 200 mm at all ts concentrations red lines in figure s6 while the identification of non foaming group 1 versus foaming sludge groups 2 and 3 is clear the cut off between groups 2 and 3 is somewhat arbitrary however these groups were putatively defined to provide a standard classification system for the purpose of subsequent analyses further experience in the application of our foaming potential test for ad surveillance will likely allow refinement of these cut off values 3 2 2 microbial community composition analyses the 25 most abundant bacterial asvs across all the sampled ad sludges are displayed in figure 1 asv23 of ca brevefilum fermentans was in relatively higher abundances in sludges classified to groups 2 søholt 9 2 and 3 ejby mølle 9 mariagerfjord 8 5 compared to those of the non foaming group 1 0 0 4 additionally the well known foam former ca microthrix midas s 2 asv5 was also in higher abundances in group 3 sludges 1 5 3 1 of the reads except ejby mølle relative to group 1 and 2 sludges 0 1 0 8 other asvs also appeared to be enriched in group 3 sludges including asv125 of midas s 156 family anaerolineaceae esbjerg vest rt2b 5 4 and the asv64 of midas s 141 family rikenellaceae fornæs 4 5 mariagerfjord 8 8 in contrast several asvs were associated with group 1 sludges including asv80 of ca fermentibacter daniensis phylum fermentibacteriota and asv128 of thermoanaerobaculum phylum acidobacteria the nmds plot of weighted unifrac distances figure 2 a showed the bacterial communities of groups 1 and 3 differed significantly anosim r 0 56 p 0 006 and separated along the second axis there was also significant difference between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 together anosim r 0 26 p 0 024 there was no significant difference identified when the bacterial communities of group 1 were compared to group 2 anosim r 0 37 p 0 063 or when group 2 were compared to group 3 anosim r 0 31 p 0 97 differential abundance analysis revealed six asvs enriched in group 3 relative to group 1 according to the deseq2 log fold difference with an adjusted fdr p value of 0 05 figure 2 c we reasoned that comparative statistical analysis of the microbial communities of non foaming group 1 and foaming groups 2 and 3 sludges could reveal surfactant producing organisms figure s7a and subsequent comparisons between the communities of sludges producing unstable group 2 and stable group 3 foams could identify the hydrophobic organisms responsible for stabilizing the foams figure s7b based on these hypotheses among the top 25 most abundant bacterial asvs figure 1 those classified to ca brevefilum fermentans asv23 midas s 22 family st 12k33 asv173 midas s 5 tetrasphaera asv1 and midas s 301 genus ca cloacimonas asv187 might represent surfactant producing organisms and those classified to midas s 2 genus ca microthrix asv5 and midas s 141 family rikenellaceae asv64 potentially represent hydrophobic organisms conversely some asvs were associated with group 1 such as asv128 genus thermoanaerobaculum among the archaea genus methanothrix was dominant in all samples 41 9 77 8 of the archaeal reads figure s8 the second most abundant methanogen methanolinea was clearly more abundant in group 1 13 8 26 of the reads with the exception of hjørring at 0 1 than group 3 0 3 of the reads the archaeal communities of all plants sampled were less distinct from each other relative to the cross plant variation observed for bacterial communities as shown in the nmds plot based on weighted unifrac distances figure 2 b anosim r 0 154 p 0 14 as with the bacterial community analyses there was significant differences between the archaeal communities of group 1 and 3 sludges anosim r 0 38 p 0 016 also we did observe the significant enrichment of two members classified to the genus methanomethylovorans asv9 and the family methanoregulaceae asv19 in group 3 sludges figure 2 d figure s9 but each was abundant in only a single plant asv9 in ejby mølle and asv19 in fornæs based on the hypotheses outlined earlier statistical analysis indicates that members affiliated to the genus methanospirillum asv8 may be surfactant producing and hydrophobic organisms figure s7c s7d 3 2 3 pearson correlations between microorganisms and foam height pearson correlation analyses were performed to visualize possible relationships between the top 65 abundant microorganisms 50 bacteria and 15 archaea and foam heights with all samples in both the preliminary bubble enrichment test and the foaming classification experiment figure s10 s11 this analysis revealed some positive relationships among certain asvs and foam heights fdr p 0 05 such as asv173 family st 12k33 midas s 22 and asv1 genus tetrasphaera midas s 5 in addition asv173 showed positive correlation with asv23 ca brevefilum fermentans in both experiments and there were also positive relationships between asv64 family rikenellaceae midas s 141 and asv8 genus methanospirillum midas s 2576 these four species all grow in the digesters jiang et al 2020 there was also a positive relationship between species coming with surplus activated sludge asv5 genus ca microthrix midas s 2 and asv9 genus dechloromonas midas s 96 although the latter did not cause foaming 3 2 4 visualization of potential foam formers by fish fish was applied to confirm the relative abundance morphology and spatial arrangement of potential foam forming populations selected from those identified with the 16s rrna gene amplicon surveys these populations included ca brevefilum fermentans midas s 5 genus tetrasphaera midas s 141 family rikenellaceae midas s 22 family st 12k33 midas s 2 genus ca microthrix and species in the methanospirillum in mariagerfjord sludge samples cells of the genus ca brevefilum targeted by the cfx a6 mix probe appeared as short filaments approx 3 8 0 4 µm in size dispersed throughout the flocs figure 3 a these organisms were also observed at lengths of approx 50 μm in samples from søholt and fredericia figure 3 b tetrasphaera populations tetra183 and tetra617 probe mix in sludge from esbjerg vest 1a both hybridized with different morphologies including small micro colonies of cocci and filaments with a diameter of approx 0 8 μm figure 3 c as reported before ca microthrix mcx840 probe appeared as thin bent filaments with a diameter of approx 0 6 μm and a length of often up to 100 μm figure 3 d the cf319a phylum level probe was used to target members of midas g 141 phylotype phylum bacteroidetes due to lack of species specific gene probe for this population this probe hybridized to relatively abundant filaments approx 1 2 μm thick and 100 μm long figure 3 e and distributed throughout the flocs in both the egaa and mariagerfjord sludges the genus methanospirillum mg1200b probe was observed in sludge from mariagerfjord as short filamentous morphology approx 0 7 μm wide and 8 μm long figure 3 f consistent with the morphology reported for other phylotypes of the genus ferry et al 1974 iino et al 2010 parshina et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 3 3 correlations between physicochemical parameters and microbial community structure several of the physicochemical parameters varied between digesters such as ts 15 45 g l and nh4 n concentration 249 to 1745 mg l table 3 the nh4 n concentrations were all below the suggested ad inhibition cut off level of approx 5000 mg l of nh4 n parameswaran and rittmann 2012 also the tvfa values were far below the suggested cut off concentration for stable plant operation 50 70 mm ahring et al 1995 ferrer et al 2010 to explore relationships between the ad plant physicochemical parameters ph nh4 tn po4 3 tvfas and microbial community structure of digester sludge canonical correspondence analysis cca was performed the concentrations of nh4 and tn were significantly correlated with the distribution of the three foaming propensity sludge groupings both for the bacterial figure 4 a p 0 05 and archaeal communities figure 4 b p 0 05 4 discussion many studies have evaluated the foaming potential of anaerobic digester sludge and suggested microorganisms potentially responsible for foam formation but these associations have not been supported by statistical evidence ganidi et al 2011 subramanian et al 2015 subramanian and pagilla 2014 furthermore the identification of the microorganisms was often based on unreliable morphological characteristics see table 1 here we have applied a standard foam potential test 16s rrna gene based community analyses and fish confirmation of morphology and abundance to establish statistically significant links between the foaming potential of mesophilic digester sludge and putative foam forming microorganisms in contrast to activated sludge systems the closed anaerobic digester tanks make it difficult to observe and monitor foaming events complicating efforts for their prevention and control our proposed foaming potential test is a simple method for monitoring the general foaming propensity of ad sludges in support of our approach verified foaming events at mariagerfjord and esbjerg vest rt2b were consistent with the classification of these sludge to group 3 foaming sludge in contrast to expectations no abundant species were significantly enriched in the bubble layer formed during the foam propensity test in the preliminary bubble enrichment experiment this may be due to the short aeration time or floccular nature of the biomass where microorganisms not contributing to foam formation are still enriched due to their physical association with those that are as an alternate approach we applied a community profiling to identify the enrichment of potential foam formers in digester sludge with high foaming propensity the significant differences in bacterial community structure between non foaming group 1 and foaming group 3 sludges supported the suggestion that the community composition influenced the foaming properties of the sludge moreover differential abundance analysis identified potential roles for asvs with those enriched in sludge producing foams groups 2 and 3 suggested to produce surfactants and those enriched in sludges forming stable foams group 3 potentially having hydrophobic cell surfaces that contribute to stabilizing the foam group 3 in support of these conclusions ca microthrix was observed to be enriched in group 3 foaming sludges and is known to have a hydrophobic cell surface in situ nielsen et al 2002 archaeal species midas s 2576 genus methanospirillum asv8 potentially produces surfactants and is also known to have a hydrophobic cell wall in addition statistically significant relationships between asvs belonging to the species ca b fermentans midas s 22 family st 12k33 asv173 and tetrasphaera midas s 5 and the foaming propensity and or height were identified these observations indicate the potential importance of these phylotypes to foam formation in mesophilic ads for the first time very little is known of the ecophysiology of these putative foam forming organisms a culture independent study revealed that members of the uncultured genus ca brevefilum are fermentative chemoorganoheterotrophs with a filamentous morphology mcilroy et al 2017b these observations are consistent with the findings from other species belonging to the family anaerolineaceae in anaerobic digester systems sekiguchi et al 2003 sun et al 2016 yamada et al 2007b 2006 interestingly the asvs of ca b fermentans were found to be positively related with asv10 family methanoregulaceae figure s11 indicating a potential for parallel growth of these microorganisms physical association of the ca b fermentans with methanothrix was observed with fish previously mcilroy et al 2017b suggesting that the former genus may form symbiotic relationships with a range of methanogens members of the genera tetrasphaera and ca microthrix are well known and abundant in danish full scale wastewater treatment plants designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and are fed into ad systems with the influent where they may persist but are unlikely to grow jiang et al 2020 kirkegaard et al 2017 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 the tetrasphaera species have diverse physiology including a capability for fermentative growth and intracellular accumulation of fermentation by products and amino acids kristiansen et al 2013 nguyen et al 2015 while the ca microthrix are involved in lipid metabolism mcilroy et al 2013 nothing is known of the physiology of midas s 22 and midas s 141 which are classified to the family st 12k33 and rikenellaceae respectively the only studied isolate in these two families belonging to the genus blvii28 wastewater sludge group suggests that they are anaerobic chemoorganotrophs that ferment carbohydrates su et al 2014 the details of the potential relationships between the ca b fermentans midas s 22 midas s 141 and methanospirillum are worth further investigation and the development of control measures for these putative foam forming organisms will importantly require further studies of their physiology and ecology archaea have previous been linked to foaming events or settling problems in anaerobic digester systems yamada et al 2007a members of the genus methanothrix have previously been suggested as the primary archaeal candidates they are commonly observed in mesophilic uasb reactors and digester sludge and are known to possess a filamentous morphology and hydrophobic cell surface daffonchio et al 1995 dueholm et al 2015 grotenhuis et al 1992 however they were also observed to be the dominant methanogens in both foaming and non foaming mesophilic digesters at danish wwtps jiang et al 2020 with no significant correlation to the foaming propensity of samples analyzed in this study recently foaming issues in ad systems co digesting wastewater sludge and food waste were also linked to archaea with members from the class methanomicrobia reportedly enriched in the top foaming layer nguyen et al 2019 our study revealed that members of the genus methanospirillum class methanomicrobia were filamentous and were enriched in foaming sludge from mariagerfjord members of the methanospirillum have previously been reported to have filamentous morphology ferry et al 1974 iino et al 2010 parshina et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 but not a hydrophobic cell surface grotenhuis et al 1992 however a recent study has revealed that this genus has an amyloidic sheath structure that is usually hydrophobic christensen et al 2018 little is known about the causes of most foaming events in full scale ads our study indicates that the microorganisms responsible are both phylogenetically and physiologically diverse complicating our understanding of the operational conditions that lead to microbial mediated foaming in addition our ability to prevent or control foaming needs to also consider the conditions of the activated sludge system feeding the anaerobic digester given the identified role of immigrating species such as ca microthrix in foam formation in both systems our analyses of ad systems suggest that ammonium concentration strongly correlated to the microbial community structure and the foaming potential of sludge this is consistent with findings by he et al 2017 who showed that foaming in food waste digesters could be induced by ammonia inhibition however the ammonium concentration ranges were very different in the two studies 441 1324 mg l in our reactors and 900 4500 mg l in theirs and other factors could also be of importance e g specific substrates or the mode of loading 5 conclusion a comprehensive investigation of putative foam forming microorganisms in mesophilic ads treating surplus activated sludge was performed with 16s rrna gene amplicon and fish based microbial community analyses significant differences were observed between the microbial communities of non foaming and foaming mesophilic digesters consistent with the findings of previous studies species from genus ca microthrix coming from the surplus activated sludge were frequently associated with foaming in addition several novel species level phylotypes potentially growing in the digester were enriched in sludges with a high foaming propensity indicating their potential role in foam formation including members of the genera ca brevefilum ca b fermentans the families st 12k33 midas s 22 and rikenellaceae midas s 141 and the archaeal genus methanospirillum midas s 2576 we suggest that the proliferation of these species can be used as early warning indicators for foaming events moreover increased concentrations of ammonium and tn were found to be positively correlated with the foaming propensity of sludges further full scale studies are needed to find potential control measures for putative foam forming populations and to assess their value along with other physical parameters as early warning indicators of imminent foaming events overall this study identified several new putative foam forming microorganisms in mesophilic ad systems allowing for the subsequent surveillance of their abundances and studies of their ecology that will importantly inform the development of

17206,the removal of micropollutants from wastewater is an emerging issue that currently concerns the wastewater sector the most granular activated carbon gac has gained recognition as a suitable technology for dealing with this problem this study assesses the performance of six gac filters for the removal of micropollutants installed as final treatment step at a municipal wastewater treatment plant the influence of the gac type and the empty bed contact time ebct on the filter performance was evaluated the breakthrough behaviour of 13 selected micropollutants as well as the removal of the dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorption at 254 nm were investigated besides the adsorbed doc qdoc was introduced as assessment parameter adsorbed and biodegraded doc instead of the commonly used treated bed volume finally size exclusion chromatography sec with online doc and uv254nm detection was applied for a better understanding of the influent and effluent characteristics the results showed that the pore size distribution is a crucial feature of the activated carbon a balanced proportion of macro meso and micropores may play a role in the better removal of micropollutants in presence of doc regardless of the gac type a minimum ebct between 20 30 min was necessary we proved that a short ebct would not fully use the sorption capacity whereas a long ebct would increase the carbon demand without improving of the removal lastly according to the sec results after a short operation time no difference between the influent and effluent chromatographable fractions doc and uv254nm was observed keywords activated carbon filtration adsorption dissolved organic carbon empty bed contact time micropollutants size exclusion chromatography 1 introduction granular activated carbon gac is a well established process for the removal of micropollutants in the drinking water sector knowledge transfer for wastewater applications is still ongoing guidelines and recommendations are being developed for the efficient design and operation of gac filters in wastewater treatment plants see dwa 2020 and böhler et al 2020 the removal mechanism implemented in the gac filters is the adsorptive binding of micropollutants onto the activated carbon surface sontheimer et al 1988 the removal is substance specific and depends on wastewater matrix process parameters and gac type benstöm et al 2017 jekel et al 2015 sontheimer et al 1988 one of the most important process parameters is the contact time the contact time is the period during which the liquid phase and the activated carbon are able to interact i e the time the dissolved substances have to be transferred from the liquid phase to the carbon surface two definitions of this parameter are commonly used the empty bed contact time ebct and the effective contact time the ebct is defined as the ratio between the volume of the filter bed and the influent flow whereas effective contact time is defined as the product of ebct and the bed porosity sontheimer et al 1988 worch 2012 several studies have already demonstrated that for water treatment applications the ebct should be in the range of 10 50 min benstöm et al 2017 pöpel et al 1988 sontheimer et al 1988 zietzschmann et al 2014 moreover krückels et al 1976 found out that the breakthrough point depends only on the ebct a desired ebct can be obtained by adjusting the filter velocity vf and the height of the filter bed however due to mass transfer and process considerations it is recommended to set vf between 5 15 m h cloirec and faur 2006 dvgw 2011 jekel and czekalla 2017 letterman 1999 sontheimer et al 1988 tchobanoglous et al 2014 as shown in table i of the supplementary material in the last few years many studies on the removal of micropollutants by gac have appeared the experiments were carried out either directly after secondary clarification after an advanced filtration stage or after pre ozonation the ebct in these studies varied between 10 75 min table i benstöm et al 2017 made a comprehensive meta analysis of 44 published studies they found that the ebct did not have a statistically significant effect on the breakthrough however these results are not conclusive due the insufficient amount and heterogeneity of the analysed data this work aims to investigate the different factors that affect the performance of gac filters for the removal of micropollutants from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent it presents operational data collected from a pilot plant located right after a conventional municipal wwtp the influence of gac type and ebct is thoroughly investigated breakthrough curves for individual micropollutants as well as the removal of doc uv254nm and sum of micropollutants s are evaluated biodegradation in the gac filters is also investigated for the long term operation unlike other studies this work introduces for the first time the adsorbed doc qdoc as assessment parameter adsorbed and biodegraded doc so that the results are comparable regardless of the influent conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot plant design and operation the effluent of a municipal wwtp in southern hesse germany was treated by a pilot plant for 32 months the wwtp population equivalents 70 000 average dry weather flow 10 300 m³ d is equipped with a mechanical pre treatment as well as three activated sludge tanks with denitrification and nitrification including phosphorus removal by iron chloride coagulation the sludge is treated in an anaerobic digester and the reject water is returned to the wwtp without any further treatment the pilot plant average inflow 30 35 m³ d consisted of a pre treatment stage for secondary phosphorus and suspended solids removal as well as a battery of gac filters for effluent polishing fig 1 for pre treatment either cloth filtration cf mecana umwelttechnik gmbh switzerland or membrane filtration microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf pall corporation germany in combination with coagulation iron iii chloride or aluminium iii chloride was used table ii supplementary material the effluent of the pre treatment corresponded to the inflow to the gac filters three different effluents were used as influent for the gac filters effluent cf effluent combination cf and mf uf effluent mf uf see table 1 the different influents were used to investigate the backwash behaviour and the influence on the biological activity in the filters fundneider et al 2021 due to the experimental set up the influent was almost saturated with oxygen without additional aeration detailed information about the pilot plant is also available in fundneider 2020 as shown in fig 1 the gac battery consisted of one full scale gac filter s1 and five pilot scale gac filters s2 s6 the filters differed in the diameter s1 1 6 m s2 s6 0 143 m and in the filter bed height see table 1 inside of the pilot scale gac filters s2 s6 there were also supporting layers of gravel 1 height 0 05 m diameter 6 8 mm 2 height 0 05 m diameter 4 6 mm 3 height 0 055 m diameter 4 2 mm the six filters were operated with different pre treated effluents and different types of activated carbon hydraffin ar and hydraffin cc plus in addition vf as well as ebcts varied between 3 7 9 7 m h and 6 35 min respectively table iii in the supplementary material summarizes the characteristics of the gac types the gac filters were fed top down and backwashed bottom up the filters were backwashed manually using air and water backwashing was initiated when the maximum gac filter pressure s1 3 6 bar s2 s6 200 300 mbar was reached after the filtration process was interrupted the filter bed was loosened by compressed air s1 vair 10 20 m h t 5 10 min s2 s6 vair 50 70 m h t 5 min and water flushing s1 vbw 4 m h t 5 15 min s2 s6 vbw 10 20 m h t 5 10 min so that the filter bed expanded by about 10 30 afterwards the filter bed was rinsed with water until the backwash water was no longer turbid s1 vbw 4 m h t 15 30 min s2 s6 vbw 10 20 m h t 10 20 min allowing the filtration to continue the average backwash frequency of the gac filter with membrane based pre treatment was 0 1 1 week compared to cf pre treatment and the mixture with 1 2 1 week fundneider et al 2021 table 1 contains a full description of the filter operation 2 2 sampling and chemical analyses 2 2 1 wastewater sampling for the assessment of the filters 24 h flow proportional mixed samples 24 h ms were taken daily by an automatic sampler at the sample points shown in fig 1 p2 p14 the 24 h ms were collected in 5 l glass bottles and stored dark storage at 4 c out of these samples weekly mixed samples w ms were prepared for each sampling point 50 ml of each 24 h ms were transferred into a 500 ml glass bottle and again stored dark storage at 4 c prior to further analysis further information about the sampling can be found in the supplementary material 2 2 2 analysis of conventional parameters and micropollutants doc was measured with a vario toc cube elementar analysesysteme germany these samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane filter polyethersulfone vwr the uv254nm was determined with an uv vis spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach lange 50 mm qs cuvette hellma analytics chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble cod scod were measured using hach cuvette tests lck 1414 and a hach photometer dr 5000 the list of micropollutants covered in this study included 13 substances from the categories of human pharmaceuticals metabolites and industrial chemicals amisulpride asp benzotriazole bta candesartan cst carbamazepine cbz citalopram ctp diclofenac dcf gabapentin gpt gpt lactam gpt l irbesartan ibs metoprolol met primidone pmd sum 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole 45bta venlafaxine vlf see table iv in the supplementary material the selection was based on their occurrence and concentration in the wwtp effluent the different substance properties jekel et al 2015 as well as their regulatory relevance uvek 2016 the substances used were classified as strongly well or moderately poorly adsorbable as well as biodegradable or non biodegradable according to jekel et al 2015 rizzo et al 2019 and boix et al 2016 the analysis was performed using two different methods and laboratories ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms of filtered samples 0 45 µm with and without sample pre concentration was conducted by fresenius university of applied sciences hsf idstein germany measurements were carried out in accordance with din 38 407 36 2014 din 2014 and din 38 407 47 2017 din 2017 in addition high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms without enrichment was conducted by the federal institute of hydrology bfg in koblenz germany according to the method described by hermes et al 2018 the standard analyses were performed by hsf whereas an extended selection of substances was measured by bfg table iv supplementary material 2 2 3 size exclusion chromatography with online organic carbon oc and uv254 nm detection doc was further analysed by size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with online doc and uv254 nm detection frimmel and abbt braun 1999 frimmel and abbt braun 2011 huber et al 2011 huber and frimmel 1991 the analysis was performed by the engler bunte institut water chemistry and water technology at the karlsruhe institute of technology for the chromatographic separation a toyopearl tsk hw 50s resin column 250 20 mm was used exclusion and permeate volume of the sec column was set by dextran blue 2 106 g mol retention time 28 8 min and methanol 32 g mol retention time 69 1 min hence the calibration was done with polyethylene glycols 100 000 200 g mol diethylene glycol 106 g mol and ethylene glycol 62 g mol resulting in the assignment of nominal weight fractions in the range of 2 106 62 g mol retention time 28 8 69 1 min in a first attempt the retention times are inversely correlated with the molecular size and in good approximation with the molecular weight of the eluted substances a phosphate buffer 1 5 g l na2hpo4 2h2o 2 5 g l kh2po4 was used as eluent at a flow rate of 1 1 ml min the injection volume was 1 ml for the determination of the chromatographable doc cdoc the doc of each sample was analysed within a by pass potassium hydrogen phthalate was used as calibration standard the cdoc was in the range of 56 98 the hydrophobic fraction of doc hdoc was determined from the difference between doc measured via the bypass and cdoc a more detailed description of the experimental set up of the sec system is given elsewhere huber and frimmel 1994 for analysis 24 h ms under dry as well as rainy weather conditions were used and filtered through syringe attachment filters 0 45 µm polyethersulfone vwr after sampling with a disposable syringe 5 ml injekt b braun melsungen ag the samples were stored in 40 ml centrifuge tubes vwr at 4 c dark until cooled shipping after maximum 7 d according to the specifications of the analytical laboratory the samples were then injected into the system directly or after dilution with deionized water without further treatment thus for a further characterization of the different size fractions the doc and uv254nm chromatograms are divided into five fractions based on the retention time fractions i to v plus the hdoc due to the fact that doc contains many unknown organic substances it is impossible to perform the calibration with authentic molecules fatoorehchi et al 2018 the relative distribution of different fractions is based on the peak area of the chromatographable organic compounds 2 3 data processing the ratio between influent and effluent concentrations of gac filters c c0 from w ms is required for the analysis of the system performance similarly to the breakthrough limits selected by uvek 2016 and koms bw 2018 or used in benstöm et al 2017 knopp et al 2016 this work considered that a relative removal c c0 for micropollutants of 0 2 is needed this is a theoretical limit introduced for an easier comparison of the results for the calculation of the ratio the effluent concentration from the pre treatment of the pilot plant p2 p4 was considered as the concentration of the influent for the gac filters for the influent concentrations below the limit of quantification loq were not taken into account for the effluent concentrations below loq were set to the concentration of the loq value this approach prevents an overestimation in the performance of the gac filters for substances which concentration is close to the loq this may lead to uncertainties in the calculation of the removal efficiency the qdoc was determined through a mass balance for each gac filter using the measurements from the w ms due to the biological activity detected in the gac filters the calculated qdoc includes not only the adsorbed doc but also the doc that is biologically removed within the gac filters for the evaluation of the removal doc uv254nm individual micropollutants and s were used s is defined as the average removal of the following substances asp bta cst cbz ctp dcf ibs met 45bta and vlf for the analysis and graphic representation of the results the micropollutant concentrations doc and uv254nm measured from the w ms were allocated to the mean value of the treated bed volume bv and qdoc during the week under consideration 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of activated carbon type fig 2 presents a comparison between the evaluated gac types based on the removal of selected micropollutants as well as the doc and s the chosen micropollutants were selected as examples that represent certain groups of substances with specific characteristics out of the six gac filters the filters s2 and s4 operated with hydraffin ar and s3 and s5 operated with hydraffin cc plus were evaluated here they operated under the same conditions in terms of ebct vf and influent quality therefore the differences in these results could be attributed solely to the gac type bta and primidone pmd showed a higher affinity to hydraffin cc plus cst and dcf showed a higher affinity to hydraffin ar whereas met and cbz were equally removed by both gac types table v in the supplementary material contains the average removal for each of the investigated micropollutants doc as well as uv254nm the main differences between these activated carbons are the raw material and the pore size distribution specifically mesopore and micropore volume hydraffin ar had a specific mesopore and micropore volume of 0 270 cm³ g and 0 321 cm³ g respectively whereas hydraffin cc plus had values of 0 135 cm³ g and 0 440 cm³ g respectively bta has a molecular weight of 119 g mol hence it can be considered a small molecule compared to the other micropollutants investigated for bta the gac filters s3 s5 using hydraffin cc plus s3 s5 had an average c c0 0 04 whereas the filters with hydraffin ar s2 s4 had an average c c0 0 15 this means hydraffin cc plus removed 75 more bta than those filters using hydraffin ar fig 2 a substances with a medium molecular weight such as cbz 236 g mol and met 267 g mol were removed by hydraffin ar and hydraffin cc plus to a similar extent in contrast substances with a high molecular weight like dcf 296 g mol and cst 440 g mol were better removed by hydraffin ar several studies have reported that gacs with a high proportion of micropores such as hydraffin cc plus are more affected by pore blockages due the adsorption of doc on macro and mesopores and hence they would probably remove less micropollutants guillossou et al 2020a 2020b newcombe et al 2002 we hypothesize that in the case of hydraffin ar a balanced proportion of macro meso and micropores might have played a role in the better removal of micropollutants in presence of doc alves et al 2018 showed that the mesopore volume has a strong influence in the micropollutants removal in the absence of doc however in the presence of doc the effect of the mesopore volume might be outweighed by the effect of the chemical properties of the carbon similarly even though the molecular weight contributes to determine the adsorption behaviour of a given substance it is not the only property that does so other physicochemical properties such as polarity and aromaticity play also a role in the adsorption behaviour zietzschmann 2016 the influence of those properties as well as ph of the water were however not within the scope of this work the gac type had a rather slight effect on the removal of doc and s as fig 2 shows hydraffin ar removed approximately 15 30 more of the doc and s than hydraffin cc plus as doc is a sum parameter and s represents the sum of measurements of several micropollutants the differences in their removal are not as prominent as in the case of the individual micropollutants at high c c0 ratios for doc c c0 0 8 and s c c0 0 4 the performance of both gac types was nearly equal fig 2 this points towards a greater dominance of biological processes rather than adsorption activated carbon close to saturation the influence of gac type on the removal of other investigated micropollutants uv254nm and qdoc is shown in figure i of the supplementary material our findings indicate that the gac type had a strong effect on the individual micropollutant removal but only a minor effect on the removal of doc and s these results are however only valid for the specific effluent tested in this study fig 3 shows qdoc in relation to the c c0 ratio of s a b and uv254nm removal c d for the gac filters s1 s5 qdoc is the doc mass that remained whithin the gac filters over the operation time qdoc allows the comparison between gac filters with different start up times and influent concentrations if the influent doc concentration does not strongly fluctuate bv is also a suitable parameter of comparison it is important to underline that the described changes in the sorption capacity measured as qdoc do not necessarly reflect the individual micropolllutant removal the breakthrough curves are depicted for ebcts ranging from 6 33 min according to the literature a higher utilization of the gac capacity is likely to occur with an increasing ebct bitterwolf et al 2017 freihardt et al 2017 nowotny 2008 zietzschmann et al 2014 regardless of gac type the ebct had a similar effect on the performance owning to the similar grain sizes of hydraffin ar and hydraffin cc plus table iii supplementary material the smaller the grain size the larger the specific surface area of the gac and the shorter the ebct to set the equilibrium sontheimer et al 1988 the results as quantified by the qdoc confirmed the effect of ebct on the utilization of the sorption capacity for ebcts between 6 24 min for the same relative removal c c0 the measured qdoc was higher for those gac filters operating at higher ebcts in contrast no difference in qdoc was found between ebcts of 24 33 min which supports the existence of a ebct after which the utilization capacity of the gac cannot be further improved due to the specific characteristics of the two gac types different sorption capacities were expected for the same relative removal c c0 of uv254nm and s the filters using hydraffin ar reached a higher qdoc than those with hydraffin cc plus this supports the results from fig 2 which pointed out that hydraffin ar was more suitable for the removal of s and doc than hydraffin cc plus fig 3 shows that regardless of the gac type and the ebct from a qdoc 50 mgdoc ggac the uv254nm curve becomes steeper with qdoc which indicates that the uv254nm ratio slowly begins to settle down the fact that this ratio never reaches 1 is caused by the overlapping of adsorptive and biological processes fundneider et al 2021 as to be expected the shorter the ebct the more pronounced the change i e the worse the removal however the change in the removal of s with qdoc was not as pronounced as it was for uv254nm it is known that the removal of uv254nm absorbing substances have an earlier breakthrough than micropollutants the removal of micropollutants like in the group of s correlates with the removal of uv absorbing substances however the uv254nm decrease is not necessarily caused by the micropollutants removal itself but is rather a result of the organic matter removal altmann et al 2016 the correlation between uv254nm and s for the gacs are showing figure ii in the supplementary material finally the value of the minimum ebct proved to be independent of the gac type for both hydraffin ar and hydrafinn cc plus as fig 3 shows a ebct longer than 25 min seemed to be the most advatnageous for the operation this is however only valid for gac types which grain size is similar as it was the case of the present study 3 2 influence of ebct on gac utilization and removal of substances operation time and or bv at which the breakthrough point is attained are often used as assessment parameters for gac filters sontheimer et al 1988 comparing systems based on these parameters seems to be problematic as fluctuations in the influent concentration and load are often present influent variations change the filter lifetime and or treated bv at which breakthrough occurs flow variations also result in the change of the ebct which in turn interferes with both adsorptive and biological removal lower flows result in an increase in ebct whereas an increase in flow causes a decrease in ebct this work uses for the first time qdoc as assessment parameter of pilot and full scale gac filters because it has the advantage of being independent from the influent variations in concentration and flow the implementation of qdoc as routine operation criterion can be challenging due to the need of frequent determination of doc and it is not intended to replace bv for effluents that show a correlation between doc and uv254nm an indirect on line determination of doc and qdoc is feasible in our study the influent variations did not affect the doc composition in terms of adsorbability or biodegradability fundneider 2020 zietzschmann et al 2016 already proposed that for comparing filters with different doc concentrations and doc fractions e g drinking water and wastewater the breakthrough curves for doc and the low molecular weight doc fraction have to be normalized by the mass of carbon although it is already known that longer ebcts enhance the removal of doc and micropollutants the maximum value from which ebct stops influencing the utilization of the sorption capacity has still to be determined bitterwolf et al 2017 freihardt et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2014 the data corresponding to the filters using hydraffin ar s1 s2 s4 was used for an analysis of the influence of the ebct on the activated carbon utilization and the removal performance this work systematically investigates such an influence at a pilot scale figs 4 a and b compare the influence of ebct for different removal levels of s and uv254nm the qdoc displayed in the figures is specific for the evaluated c c0 ratios ebcts 20 min showed a linear correlation with qdoc for the c c0 ratios for both parameters whereas for ebcts 20 min no changes on the qdoc were observed which was more pronounced for uv254nm figs 4 c and d show the influence of ebct on qdoc for individual micropollutants until the breakthrough limit c c0 0 2 was met fig 4 c presents the data for strongly well adsorbable micropollutants bta cbz and ibs and fig 4 d for moderately poorly adsorbable micropollutants cst pmd and gpt both groups presented the same tendency for the s and uv254nm linear correlation followed by the stagnation after ebct 20 min however an ebct 20 min had a stronger influence on the removal of well adsorbable micropollutants than on the removal of poorly moderately adsorbable micropollutants for example for bta increasing the ebct from 12 24 min resulted in an increase of qdoc of 47 mgdoc ggac in contrast for gpt qdoc increased only by 11 mgdoc ggac studies of benstöm 2017 have shown the same trend doubling the ebct from 15 33 min shifted the breakthrough point by a factor of 1 6 for cbz and by a factor of 2 0 for doc carbon usage rate cur and bv are commonly used for the assessment of gac filters sontheimer et al 1988 figs 4 e and f display the relationship between cur and bv with qdoc long ebcts led to a better utilization of the gac capacity and thus to longer filter lifetimes the influent doc doc0 concentration plays an important role however it is not considered in cur and bv high doc0 concentrations lead to a faster exhaustion of the gac capacity the results suggest that from an ebct between 20 30 min any further increase would not enhance the removal performance of the gac filters in addition the effect of the vf ranging between 3 7 9 3 m h at comparable ebcts of 33 min and 25 min see table 1 on the activated carbon utilization was not evident we recommend an ebct between 20 30 min as minimum for the gac filter design the selection of a proper ebct guarantees a better utilization of the sorption capacity although the gac and pac grain sizes are different by setting the ebct properly the cur for gac filters become comparable to those for pac systems bitterwolf et al 2017 found that gac filters operating with gac with a grain size of 1 18 2 36 mm an ebct of 25 min and low doc0 concentration 5 6 mg l have similar cur than a pac system whereas böhler et al 2012 observed an increase in the cur in gac filters operated at ebct 10 15 min our findings along with the results of bitterwolf et al 2017 and böhler et al 2012 provide evidence that a comparison between pac and gac is only meaningful when the ebct is properly selected moreover the cur of gac systems can be further reduced by the parallel operation of several filters in doing so a more efficient operation is expected from a gac system than from a pac system although qdoc comprises doc removed by both adsorptive and biological processes the effect of the ebct was clearly observed and a minimum value for the ebct could be determined based on the qdoc calculated through mass balances 3 3 influence of ebct on the chromatographable doc and uv254nm fractions the doc of influent and effluent samples was characterized by sec at different operation times to get further information on the composition of the doc fractions fig 5 shows the relative distribution of five size fractions uv254nm for different qdoc and ebcts values for the experiments using hydraffin ar fraction i is attributed to compounds with the highest molecular weight large size whereas fraction v contains the substances with the smallest molecular weight small size however due to adsorption and ion exchange phenomena occurring between the resin material and the analytes high molecular weight compounds may elute later than expected frimmel and abbt braun 2011 lankes et al 2009 the chromatograms and the relative distribution of the corresponding doc and uv254nm fractions for the influent are included in figure iii of the supplementary material for qdoc 30 mgdoc ggac the uv254nm absorbable higher molecular size fractions ii iii and iv were better removed than fraction v which dominated the effluent starting from approximately qdoc 28 mgdoc ggac the changes in the relative distribution of the fractions are small and seem to be independent from the ebct the data of influent and effluent look similar which shows that there is no selective removal by the gac filters this was observed for qdoc 28 mgdoc ggac and qdoc 31 mgdoc ggac there was no difference in the relative distribution of the five fractions at ebcts of 15 and 33 min the same was valid for qdoc 131 mgdoc ggac and qdoc 132 mgdoc ggac the distributions were similar despite the differences in the ebcts 16 and 6 min respectively a similar behaviour was observed for the gac filters operated with hydraffin cc plus figure iv supplementary material similarly to the discussed results for the filters filled with hydraffin ar the influent and effluent chromatographable uv254nm fractions equalized from a certain qdoc onwards and the ebct did not affect them fraction v which mainly represents molecules of small size was better removed by hydraffin cc plus than hydraffin ar which is a result of the different pore size distributions of these gacs as discussed in the previous sections hydraffin cc plus also showed higher preference to low molecular weight substances which might be also related to the better removal of the fraction v from the uv254nm the results for the cdoc fractions for hydraffin ar were similar to the ones for the uv254nm fractions figure v supplementary material with increasing qdoc the hdoc in the effluent increased up to about 15 at q 152 mgdoc ggac in contrast to the cdoc and uv254nm fractions the hdoc in the effluent never reached the values of the influent approximately 30 as shown in figure v in the supplementary material this suggests that the hdoc was continuously but not completely removed and thus this fraction is mainly responsible for the measured doc removal the studies showed that there was no change in the relative distribution of cdoc and uv254nm size fractions in the effluent when qdoc achieved a certain level hydraffin ar 30 mgdoc ggac hydraffin cc plus 17 mgdoc ggac from those qdoc values onwards mainly the hdoc was removed our findings confirm the observations of previous studies benstöm 2017 already observed that after about bv 1100 m³ m³ there is no change in the composition of the cdoc fractions and that the doc removal is mainly caused by the hdoc likewise zietzschmann et al 2014 showed through rapid small scale column tests that the adsorption selectivity of the cdoc fractions decreases with increasing bv studies with small scale filters ebct 40 min vgac 0 09 l showed that there were no changes in the size distribution of the cdoc fractions in the effluent for bvs between 3500 30 000 m³ m³ pramanik et al 2016 the results in this section indicate that the distribution of the uv254nm singal as well as the cdoc are independent of the ebct however the distributions are influenced by the gac type our results also show that after a certain qdoc dependant on the gac type the effluent distributions of uv254nm singal and cdoc approach the ones of the influent further research is needed to clarify the mechanism underlying these phenomena and their implications to the micropollutants removal and to the gac filters operation 3 4 breakthrough behaviour and performance for micropollutant removal the breakthrough behaviour of micropollutants can only be compared under similar conditions such as ebct gac type biofilm amount and activity doc concentration and fractionation fig 6 summarises the effect of the ebct the adsorbability of micropollutants as well as other processes on the breakthrough point as a function of qdoc the traditional breakthrough curves of the investigated micropollutants as a function of the treated bv can be found in the supplementary material see figure vi figure xii fig 6 a shows an example of the effect of ebct on adsorptive processes for strongly and moderately adsorbable substances like bta and cst respectively for both substances a better performance was observed with increasing ebct furthermore there was no significance difference for the curves corresponding to ebct 24 min and 33 min the breakthrough time and qdoc at which the breakthrough of micropollutants occurs is affected by the adsorption behaviour of the micropollutants the lower the affinity the earlier the breakthrough time however the breakthrough time can be shifted by increasing the ebct the effect is more pronounced for strongly adsorbable than for moderately poorly adsorbable substances fig 6 b shows that pmd which is poorly adsorbable and non biodegradable is moderately affected by the increase in ebct in contrast met which is well adsorbable and biodegradable presented a clearer effect of the ebct on the breakthrough the effect is also visible for cbz which is also well adsorbable and non biodegradable or asp dcf and vlf which are well adsorbable and biodegradable figure xiii supplementary material fig 6 c shows that after a certain time establishment of the biological community c c0 fluctuates instead of becoming constant as expected for a purely adsorptive removal this is an indication of biological activity fundneider et al 2021 and or desorption the influent doc concentration ranged between 4 0 7 9 mg l 6 4 1 0 mg l n 134 so we assume that desorption had a slight influence considering that adequate growth conditions for the biofilm were given substrate and nutrients availability as well as redox conditions fundneider 2020 longer ebcts have also a positive effect on biological processes occurring within the gac filter as an increase in the ebct improves the substrate uptake by the biofilm fig 6 c shows for example that gpt which is poorly adsorbable and biodegradable is removed 2 3 times better at ebct 24 min compared to ebct 6 min the biodegradation of gpt as well as the production of the metabolite gpt l were monitored for all gac filters figure xiv supplementary material this strongly suggests that the gpt removal was almost exclusively attributed to biological processes as already reported by henning et al 2018 sperlich et al 2017 in case of ibs a well adsorbable and moderately biodegradable substance boix et al 2016 the same trend was observed however due to simultaneous occurrence of adsorption and biological processes c c0 fluctuates only slightly 4 conclusions gac filters are an alternative to pac processes for the removal of micropollutants form wastewater full and pilot scale experiments under real conditions were conducted to quantify the effect of ebct on micropollutant uv254nm and doc removal based on the presented results the following conclusions can be drawn the gac type affects the removal of individual micropollutants a balanced proportion of macro meso and micropores may play a role in the better removal of micropollutants in presence of doc ebct does not influence the relative distribution of the cdoc and uv254nm signal in the effluent after a certain qdoc the relative distribution of the cdoc and uv254nm signal in the effluent approaches the one of the influent the ebct is the key factor for the design of gac filters for wastewater treatment the ebct greatly influences the breakthrough point of individual micropollutants doc and uv254nm absorbing substances there is a minimum ebct for the adsorptive removal of micropollutants increasing the ebct leads to a better removal of the micropollutants and to a better utilization of the sorption capacity however after approximately 20 30 min a further increase does not enhance the overall filter performance anymore declaration of

17206,the removal of micropollutants from wastewater is an emerging issue that currently concerns the wastewater sector the most granular activated carbon gac has gained recognition as a suitable technology for dealing with this problem this study assesses the performance of six gac filters for the removal of micropollutants installed as final treatment step at a municipal wastewater treatment plant the influence of the gac type and the empty bed contact time ebct on the filter performance was evaluated the breakthrough behaviour of 13 selected micropollutants as well as the removal of the dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorption at 254 nm were investigated besides the adsorbed doc qdoc was introduced as assessment parameter adsorbed and biodegraded doc instead of the commonly used treated bed volume finally size exclusion chromatography sec with online doc and uv254nm detection was applied for a better understanding of the influent and effluent characteristics the results showed that the pore size distribution is a crucial feature of the activated carbon a balanced proportion of macro meso and micropores may play a role in the better removal of micropollutants in presence of doc regardless of the gac type a minimum ebct between 20 30 min was necessary we proved that a short ebct would not fully use the sorption capacity whereas a long ebct would increase the carbon demand without improving of the removal lastly according to the sec results after a short operation time no difference between the influent and effluent chromatographable fractions doc and uv254nm was observed keywords activated carbon filtration adsorption dissolved organic carbon empty bed contact time micropollutants size exclusion chromatography 1 introduction granular activated carbon gac is a well established process for the removal of micropollutants in the drinking water sector knowledge transfer for wastewater applications is still ongoing guidelines and recommendations are being developed for the efficient design and operation of gac filters in wastewater treatment plants see dwa 2020 and böhler et al 2020 the removal mechanism implemented in the gac filters is the adsorptive binding of micropollutants onto the activated carbon surface sontheimer et al 1988 the removal is substance specific and depends on wastewater matrix process parameters and gac type benstöm et al 2017 jekel et al 2015 sontheimer et al 1988 one of the most important process parameters is the contact time the contact time is the period during which the liquid phase and the activated carbon are able to interact i e the time the dissolved substances have to be transferred from the liquid phase to the carbon surface two definitions of this parameter are commonly used the empty bed contact time ebct and the effective contact time the ebct is defined as the ratio between the volume of the filter bed and the influent flow whereas effective contact time is defined as the product of ebct and the bed porosity sontheimer et al 1988 worch 2012 several studies have already demonstrated that for water treatment applications the ebct should be in the range of 10 50 min benstöm et al 2017 pöpel et al 1988 sontheimer et al 1988 zietzschmann et al 2014 moreover krückels et al 1976 found out that the breakthrough point depends only on the ebct a desired ebct can be obtained by adjusting the filter velocity vf and the height of the filter bed however due to mass transfer and process considerations it is recommended to set vf between 5 15 m h cloirec and faur 2006 dvgw 2011 jekel and czekalla 2017 letterman 1999 sontheimer et al 1988 tchobanoglous et al 2014 as shown in table i of the supplementary material in the last few years many studies on the removal of micropollutants by gac have appeared the experiments were carried out either directly after secondary clarification after an advanced filtration stage or after pre ozonation the ebct in these studies varied between 10 75 min table i benstöm et al 2017 made a comprehensive meta analysis of 44 published studies they found that the ebct did not have a statistically significant effect on the breakthrough however these results are not conclusive due the insufficient amount and heterogeneity of the analysed data this work aims to investigate the different factors that affect the performance of gac filters for the removal of micropollutants from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent it presents operational data collected from a pilot plant located right after a conventional municipal wwtp the influence of gac type and ebct is thoroughly investigated breakthrough curves for individual micropollutants as well as the removal of doc uv254nm and sum of micropollutants s are evaluated biodegradation in the gac filters is also investigated for the long term operation unlike other studies this work introduces for the first time the adsorbed doc qdoc as assessment parameter adsorbed and biodegraded doc so that the results are comparable regardless of the influent conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 pilot plant design and operation the effluent of a municipal wwtp in southern hesse germany was treated by a pilot plant for 32 months the wwtp population equivalents 70 000 average dry weather flow 10 300 m³ d is equipped with a mechanical pre treatment as well as three activated sludge tanks with denitrification and nitrification including phosphorus removal by iron chloride coagulation the sludge is treated in an anaerobic digester and the reject water is returned to the wwtp without any further treatment the pilot plant average inflow 30 35 m³ d consisted of a pre treatment stage for secondary phosphorus and suspended solids removal as well as a battery of gac filters for effluent polishing fig 1 for pre treatment either cloth filtration cf mecana umwelttechnik gmbh switzerland or membrane filtration microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf pall corporation germany in combination with coagulation iron iii chloride or aluminium iii chloride was used table ii supplementary material the effluent of the pre treatment corresponded to the inflow to the gac filters three different effluents were used as influent for the gac filters effluent cf effluent combination cf and mf uf effluent mf uf see table 1 the different influents were used to investigate the backwash behaviour and the influence on the biological activity in the filters fundneider et al 2021 due to the experimental set up the influent was almost saturated with oxygen without additional aeration detailed information about the pilot plant is also available in fundneider 2020 as shown in fig 1 the gac battery consisted of one full scale gac filter s1 and five pilot scale gac filters s2 s6 the filters differed in the diameter s1 1 6 m s2 s6 0 143 m and in the filter bed height see table 1 inside of the pilot scale gac filters s2 s6 there were also supporting layers of gravel 1 height 0 05 m diameter 6 8 mm 2 height 0 05 m diameter 4 6 mm 3 height 0 055 m diameter 4 2 mm the six filters were operated with different pre treated effluents and different types of activated carbon hydraffin ar and hydraffin cc plus in addition vf as well as ebcts varied between 3 7 9 7 m h and 6 35 min respectively table iii in the supplementary material summarizes the characteristics of the gac types the gac filters were fed top down and backwashed bottom up the filters were backwashed manually using air and water backwashing was initiated when the maximum gac filter pressure s1 3 6 bar s2 s6 200 300 mbar was reached after the filtration process was interrupted the filter bed was loosened by compressed air s1 vair 10 20 m h t 5 10 min s2 s6 vair 50 70 m h t 5 min and water flushing s1 vbw 4 m h t 5 15 min s2 s6 vbw 10 20 m h t 5 10 min so that the filter bed expanded by about 10 30 afterwards the filter bed was rinsed with water until the backwash water was no longer turbid s1 vbw 4 m h t 15 30 min s2 s6 vbw 10 20 m h t 10 20 min allowing the filtration to continue the average backwash frequency of the gac filter with membrane based pre treatment was 0 1 1 week compared to cf pre treatment and the mixture with 1 2 1 week fundneider et al 2021 table 1 contains a full description of the filter operation 2 2 sampling and chemical analyses 2 2 1 wastewater sampling for the assessment of the filters 24 h flow proportional mixed samples 24 h ms were taken daily by an automatic sampler at the sample points shown in fig 1 p2 p14 the 24 h ms were collected in 5 l glass bottles and stored dark storage at 4 c out of these samples weekly mixed samples w ms were prepared for each sampling point 50 ml of each 24 h ms were transferred into a 500 ml glass bottle and again stored dark storage at 4 c prior to further analysis further information about the sampling can be found in the supplementary material 2 2 2 analysis of conventional parameters and micropollutants doc

spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach lange 50 mm qs cuvette hellma analytics chemical oxygen demand cod and soluble cod scod were measured using hach cuvette tests lck 1414 and a hach photometer dr 5000 the list of micropollutants covered in this study included 13 substances from the categories of human pharmaceuticals metabolites and industrial chemicals amisulpride asp benzotriazole bta candesartan cst

supplementary material the selection was based on their occurrence and concentration in the wwtp effluent the different substance properties jekel et al 2015 as well as their regulatory relevance uvek 2016 the substances used were classified as strongly well or moderately poorly adsorbable as well as biodegradable or non biodegradable according to jekel et al 2015 rizzo et al 2019 and boix et al 2016 the analysis was performed using two different methods and laboratories ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms of filtered samples 0 45 µm with and without sample pre concentration was conducted by fresenius university of applied sciences hsf idstein germany measurements were carried out in accordance with din 38 407 36 2014 din 2014 and din 38 407 47 2017 din 2017 in addition high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms without enrichment was conducted by the federal institute of hydrology bfg in koblenz germany according to the method described by hermes et al 2018 the standard analyses were performed by hsf whereas an extended selection of substances was measured by bfg table iv supplementary material 2 2 3 size exclusion chromatography with online organic carbon oc and uv254 nm detection doc was further analysed by size exclusion chromatography sec coupled with online doc and uv254 nm detection frimmel and abbt braun 1999 frimmel and abbt braun 2011 huber et al 2011 huber and frimmel 1991 the analysis was performed by the engler bunte institut water chemistry and water technology at the karlsruhe institute of technology for the chromatographic separation a toyopearl tsk hw 50s resin column 250 20 mm was used exclusion and permeate volume of the sec column was set by dextran blue 2 106 g mol retention time 28 8 min and methanol 32 g mol retention time 69 1 min hence the calibration was done with polyethylene glycols 100 000 200 g mol diethylene glycol 106 g mol and ethylene glycol 62 g mol resulting in the assignment of nominal weight fractions in the range of 2 106 62 g mol retention time 28 8 69 1 min in a first attempt the retention times are inversely correlated with the molecular size and in good approximation with the molecular weight of the eluted substances a phosphate buffer 1 5 g l na2hpo4 2h2o 2 5 g l kh2po4 was used as eluent at a flow rate of 1 1 ml min the injection volume was 1 ml for the determination of the chromatographable doc cdoc the doc of each sample was analysed within a by pass potassium hydrogen phthalate was used as calibration standard the cdoc was in the range of 56 98 the hydrophobic fraction of doc hdoc was determined from the difference between doc measured via the bypass and cdoc a more detailed description of the experimental set up of the sec system is given elsewhere huber and frimmel 1994 for analysis 24 h ms under dry as well as rainy weather conditions were used and filtered through syringe attachment filters 0 45 µm polyethersulfone vwr after sampling with a disposable syringe 5 ml injekt b braun melsungen ag the samples were stored in 40 ml centrifuge tubes vwr at 4 c dark until cooled shipping after maximum 7 d according to the specifications of the analytical laboratory the samples were then injected into the system directly or after dilution with deionized water without further treatment thus for a further characterization of the different size fractions the doc and uv254nm chromatograms are divided into five fractions based on the retention time fractions i to v plus the hdoc due to the fact that doc contains many unknown organic substances it is impossible to perform the calibration with authentic molecules fatoorehchi et al 2018 the relative distribution of different fractions is based on the peak area of the chromatographable organic compounds 2 3 data processing the ratio between influent and effluent concentrations of gac filters c c0 from w ms is required for the analysis of the system performance similarly to the breakthrough limits selected by uvek 2016 and koms bw 2018 or used in benstöm et al 2017 knopp et al 2016 this work considered that a relative removal c c0 for micropollutants of 0 2 is needed this is a theoretical limit introduced for an easier comparison of the results for the calculation of the ratio the effluent concentration from the pre treatment of the pilot plant p2 p4 was considered as the concentration of the influent for the gac filters for the influent concentrations below the limit of quantification loq were not taken into account for the effluent concentrations below loq were set to the concentration of the loq value this approach prevents an overestimation in the performance of the gac filters for substances which concentration is close to the loq this may lead to uncertainties in the calculation of the removal efficiency the qdoc was determined through a mass balance for each gac filter using the measurements from the w ms due to the biological activity detected in the gac filters the calculated qdoc includes not only the adsorbed doc but also the doc that is biologically removed within the gac filters for the evaluation of the removal doc uv254nm individual micropollutants and s were used s is defined as the average removal of the following substances asp bta cst cbz ctp dcf ibs met 45bta and vlf for the analysis and graphic representation of the results the micropollutant concentrations doc and uv254nm measured from the w ms were allocated to the mean value of the treated bed volume bv and qdoc during the week under consideration 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of activated carbon type fig 2 presents a comparison between the evaluated gac types based on the removal of selected micropollutants as well as the doc and s the chosen micropollutants were selected as examples that represent certain groups of substances with specific characteristics out of the six gac filters the filters s2 and s4 operated with hydraffin ar and s3 and s5 operated with hydraffin cc plus were evaluated here they operated under the same conditions in terms of ebct vf and influent quality therefore the differences in these results could be attributed solely to the gac type bta and primidone pmd showed a higher affinity to hydraffin cc plus cst and dcf showed a higher affinity to hydraffin ar whereas met and cbz were equally removed by both gac types table v in the supplementary material contains the average removal for each of the investigated micropollutants doc as well as uv254nm the main differences between these activated carbons are the raw material and the pore size distribution specifically mesopore and micropore volume hydraffin ar had a specific mesopore and micropore volume of 0 270 cm³ g and 0 321 cm³ g respectively whereas hydraffin cc plus had values of 0 135 cm³ g and 0 440 cm³ g respectively bta has a molecular weight of 119 g mol hence it can be considered a small molecule compared to the other micropollutants investigated for bta the gac filters s3 s5 using hydraffin cc plus s3 s5 had an average c c0 0 04 whereas the filters with hydraffin ar s2 s4 had an average c c0 0 15 this means hydraffin cc plus removed 75 more bta than those filters using hydraffin ar fig 2 a substances with a medium molecular weight such as cbz 236 g mol and met 267 g mol were removed by hydraffin ar and hydraffin cc plus to a similar extent in contrast substances with a high molecular weight like dcf 296 g mol and cst 440 g mol were better removed by hydraffin ar several studies have reported that gacs with a high proportion of micropores such as hydraffin cc plus are more affected by pore blockages due the adsorption of doc on macro and mesopores and hence they would probably remove less micropollutants guillossou et al 2020a 2020b newcombe et al 2002 we hypothesize that in the case of hydraffin ar a balanced proportion of macro meso and micropores might have played a role in the better removal of micropollutants in presence of doc alves et al 2018 showed that the mesopore volume has a strong influence in the micropollutants removal in the absence of doc however in the presence of doc the effect of the mesopore volume might be outweighed by the effect of the chemical properties of the carbon similarly even though the molecular weight contributes to determine the adsorption behaviour of a given substance it is not the only property that does so other physicochemical properties such as polarity and aromaticity play also a role in the adsorption behaviour zietzschmann 2016 the influence of those properties as well as ph of the water were however not within the scope of this work the gac type had a rather slight effect on the removal of doc and s as fig 2 shows hydraffin ar removed approximately 15 30 more of the doc and s than hydraffin cc plus as doc is a sum parameter and s represents the sum of measurements of several micropollutants the differences in their removal are not as prominent as in the case of the individual micropollutants at high c c0 ratios for doc c c0 0 8 and s c c0 0 4 the performance of both gac types was nearly equal fig 2 this points towards a greater dominance of biological processes rather than adsorption activated carbon close to saturation the influence of gac type on the removal of other investigated micropollutants uv254nm and qdoc is shown in figure i of the supplementary material our findings indicate that the gac type had a strong effect on the individual micropollutant removal but only a minor effect on the removal of doc and s these results are however only valid for the specific effluent tested in this study fig 3 shows qdoc in relation to the c c0 ratio of s a b and uv254nm removal c d for the gac filters s1 s5 qdoc is the doc mass that remained whithin the gac filters over the operation time qdoc allows the comparison between gac filters with different start up times and influent concentrations if the influent doc concentration does not strongly fluctuate bv is also a suitable parameter of comparison it is important to underline that the described changes in the sorption capacity measured as qdoc do not necessarly reflect the individual micropolllutant removal the breakthrough curves are depicted for ebcts ranging from 6 33 min according to the literature a higher utilization of the gac capacity is likely to occur with an increasing ebct bitterwolf et al 2017 freihardt et al 2017 nowotny 2008 zietzschmann et al 2014 regardless of gac type the ebct had a similar effect on the performance owning to the similar grain sizes of hydraffin ar and hydraffin cc plus table iii supplementary material the smaller the grain size the larger the specific surface area of the gac and the shorter the ebct to set the equilibrium sontheimer et al 1988 the results as quantified by the qdoc confirmed the effect of ebct on the utilization of the sorption capacity for ebcts between 6 24 min for the same relative removal c c0 the measured qdoc was higher for those gac filters operating at higher ebcts in contrast no difference in qdoc was found between ebcts of 24 33 min which supports the existence of a ebct after which the utilization capacity of the gac cannot be further improved due to the specific characteristics of the two gac types different sorption capacities were expected for the same relative removal c c0 of uv254nm and s the filters using hydraffin ar reached a higher qdoc than those with hydraffin cc plus this supports the results from fig 2 which pointed out that hydraffin ar was more suitable for the removal of s and doc than hydraffin cc plus fig 3 shows that regardless of the gac type and the ebct from a qdoc 50 mgdoc ggac the uv254nm curve becomes steeper with qdoc which indicates that the uv254nm ratio slowly begins to settle down the fact that this ratio never reaches 1 is caused by the overlapping of adsorptive and biological processes fundneider et al 2021 as to be expected the shorter the ebct the more pronounced the change i e the worse the removal however the change in the removal of s with qdoc was not as pronounced as it was for uv254nm it is known that the removal of uv254nm absorbing substances have an earlier breakthrough than micropollutants the removal of micropollutants like in the group of s correlates with the removal of uv absorbing substances however the uv254nm decrease is not necessarily caused by the micropollutants removal itself but is rather a result of the organic matter removal altmann et al 2016 the correlation between uv254nm and s for the gacs are showing figure ii in the supplementary material finally the value of the minimum ebct proved to be independent of the gac type for both hydraffin ar and hydrafinn cc plus as fig 3 shows a ebct longer than 25 min seemed to be the most advatnageous for the operation this is however only valid for gac types which grain size is similar as it was the case of the present study 3 2 influence of ebct on gac utilization and removal of substances operation time and or bv at which the breakthrough point is attained are often used as assessment parameters for gac filters sontheimer et al 1988 comparing systems based on these parameters seems to be problematic as fluctuations in the influent concentration and load are often present influent variations change the filter lifetime and or treated bv at which breakthrough occurs flow variations also result in the change of the ebct which in turn interferes with both adsorptive and biological removal lower flows result in an increase in ebct whereas an increase in flow causes a decrease in ebct this work uses for the first time qdoc as assessment parameter of pilot and full scale gac filters because it has the advantage of being independent from the influent variations in concentration and flow the implementation of qdoc as routine operation criterion can be challenging due to the need of frequent determination of doc and it is not intended to replace bv for effluents that show a correlation between doc and uv254nm an indirect on line determination of doc and qdoc is feasible in our study the influent variations did not affect the doc composition in terms of adsorbability or biodegradability fundneider 2020 zietzschmann et al 2016 already proposed that for comparing filters with different doc concentrations and doc fractions e g drinking water and wastewater the breakthrough curves for doc and the low molecular weight doc fraction have to be normalized by the mass of carbon although it is already known that longer ebcts enhance the removal of doc and micropollutants the maximum value from which ebct stops influencing the utilization of the sorption capacity has still to be determined bitterwolf et al 2017 freihardt et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2014 the data corresponding to the filters using hydraffin ar s1 s2 s4 was used for an analysis of the influence of the ebct on the activated carbon utilization and the removal performance this work systematically investigates such an influence at a pilot scale figs 4 a and b compare the influence of ebct for different removal levels of s and uv254nm the qdoc displayed in the figures is specific for the evaluated c c0 ratios ebcts 20 min showed a linear correlation with qdoc for the c c0 ratios for both parameters whereas for ebcts 20 min no changes on the qdoc were observed which was more pronounced for uv254nm figs 4 c and d show the influence of ebct on qdoc for individual micropollutants until the breakthrough limit c c0 0 2 was met fig 4 c presents the data for strongly well adsorbable micropollutants bta cbz and ibs and fig 4 d for moderately poorly adsorbable micropollutants cst pmd and gpt both groups presented the same tendency for the s and uv254nm linear correlation followed by the stagnation after ebct 20 min however an ebct 20 min had a stronger influence on the removal of well adsorbable micropollutants than on the removal of poorly moderately adsorbable micropollutants for example for bta increasing the ebct from 12 24 min resulted in an increase of qdoc of 47 mgdoc ggac in contrast for gpt qdoc increased only by 11 mgdoc ggac studies of benstöm 2017 have shown the same trend doubling the ebct from 15 33 min shifted the breakthrough point by a factor of 1 6 for cbz and by a factor of 2 0 for doc carbon usage rate cur and bv are commonly used for the assessment of gac filters sontheimer et al 1988 figs 4 e and f display the relationship between cur and bv with qdoc long ebcts led to a better utilization of the gac capacity and thus to longer filter lifetimes the influent doc doc0 concentration plays an important role however it is not considered in cur and bv high doc0 concentrations lead to a faster exhaustion of the gac capacity the results suggest that from an ebct between 20 30 min any further increase would not enhance the removal performance of the gac filters in addition the effect of the vf ranging between 3 7 9 3 m h at comparable ebcts of 33 min and 25 min see table 1 on the activated carbon utilization was not evident we recommend an ebct between 20 30 min as minimum for the gac filter design the selection of a proper ebct guarantees a better utilization of the sorption capacity although the gac and pac grain sizes are different by setting the ebct properly the cur for gac filters become comparable to those for pac systems bitterwolf et al 2017 found that gac filters operating with gac with a grain size of 1 18 2 36 mm an ebct of 25 min and low doc0 concentration 5 6 mg l have similar cur than a pac system whereas böhler et al 2012 observed an increase in the cur in gac filters operated at ebct 10 15 min our findings along with the results of bitterwolf et al 2017 and böhler et al 2012 provide evidence that a comparison between pac and gac is only meaningful when the ebct is properly selected moreover the cur of gac systems can be further reduced by the parallel operation of several filters in doing so a more efficient operation is expected from a gac system than from a pac system although qdoc comprises doc removed by both adsorptive and biological processes the effect of the ebct was clearly observed and a minimum value for the ebct could be determined based on the qdoc calculated through mass balances 3 3 influence of ebct on the chromatographable doc and uv254nm fractions the doc of influent and effluent samples was characterized by sec at different operation times to get further information on the composition of the doc fractions fig 5 shows the relative distribution of five size fractions uv254nm for different qdoc and ebcts values for the experiments using hydraffin ar fraction i is attributed to compounds with the highest molecular weight large size whereas fraction v contains the substances with the smallest molecular weight small size however due to adsorption and ion exchange phenomena occurring between the resin material and the analytes high molecular weight compounds may elute later than expected frimmel and abbt braun 2011 lankes et al 2009 the chromatograms and the relative distribution of the corresponding doc and uv254nm fractions for the influent are included in figure iii of the supplementary material for qdoc 30 mgdoc ggac the uv254nm absorbable higher molecular size fractions ii iii and iv were better removed than fraction v which dominated the effluent starting from approximately qdoc 28 mgdoc ggac the changes in the relative distribution of the fractions are small and seem to be independent from the ebct the data of influent and effluent look similar which shows that there is no selective removal by the gac filters this was observed for qdoc 28 mgdoc ggac and qdoc 31 mgdoc ggac there was no difference in the relative distribution of the five fractions at ebcts of 15 and 33 min the same was valid for qdoc 131 mgdoc ggac and qdoc 132 mgdoc ggac the distributions were similar despite the differences in the ebcts 16 and 6 min respectively a similar behaviour was observed for the gac filters operated with hydraffin cc plus figure iv supplementary material similarly to the discussed results for the filters filled with hydraffin ar the influent and effluent chromatographable uv254nm fractions equalized from a certain qdoc onwards and the ebct did not affect them fraction v which mainly represents molecules of small size was better removed by hydraffin cc plus than hydraffin ar which is a result of the different pore size distributions of these gacs as discussed in the previous sections hydraffin cc plus also showed higher preference to low molecular weight substances which might be also related to the better removal of the fraction v from the uv254nm the results for the cdoc fractions for hydraffin ar were similar to the ones for the uv254nm fractions figure v supplementary material with increasing qdoc the hdoc in the effluent increased up to about 15 at q 152 mgdoc ggac in contrast to the cdoc and uv254nm fractions the hdoc in the effluent never reached the values of the influent approximately 30 as shown in figure v in the supplementary material this suggests that the hdoc was continuously but not completely removed and thus this fraction is mainly responsible for the measured doc removal the studies showed that there was no change in the relative distribution of cdoc and uv254nm size fractions in the effluent when qdoc achieved a certain level hydraffin ar 30 mgdoc ggac hydraffin cc plus 17 mgdoc ggac from those qdoc values onwards mainly the hdoc was removed our findings confirm the observations of previous studies benstöm 2017 already observed that after about bv 1100 m³ m³ there is no change in the composition of the cdoc fractions and that the doc removal is mainly caused by the hdoc likewise zietzschmann et al 2014 showed through rapid small scale column tests that the adsorption selectivity of the cdoc fractions decreases with increasing bv studies with small scale filters ebct 40 min vgac 0 09 l showed that there were no changes in the size distribution of the cdoc fractions in the effluent for bvs between 3500 30 000 m³ m³ pramanik et al 2016 the results in this section indicate that the distribution of the uv254nm singal as well as the cdoc are independent of the ebct however the distributions are influenced by the gac type our results also show that after a certain qdoc dependant on the gac type the effluent distributions of uv254nm singal and cdoc approach the ones of the influent further research is needed to clarify the mechanism underlying these phenomena and their implications to the micropollutants removal and to the gac filters operation 3 4 breakthrough behaviour and performance for micropollutant removal the breakthrough behaviour of micropollutants can only be compared under similar conditions such as ebct gac type biofilm amount and activity doc concentration and fractionation fig 6 summarises the effect of the ebct the adsorbability of micropollutants as well as other processes on the breakthrough point as a function of qdoc the traditional breakthrough curves of the investigated micropollutants as a function of the treated bv can be found in the supplementary material see figure vi figure xii fig 6 a shows an example of the effect of ebct on adsorptive processes for strongly and moderately adsorbable substances like bta and cst respectively for both substances a better performance was observed with increasing ebct furthermore there was no significance difference for the curves corresponding to ebct 24 min and 33 min the breakthrough time and qdoc at which the breakthrough of micropollutants occurs is affected by the adsorption behaviour of the micropollutants the lower the affinity the earlier the breakthrough time however the breakthrough time can be shifted by increasing the ebct the effect is more pronounced for strongly adsorbable than for moderately poorly adsorbable substances fig 6 b shows that pmd which is poorly adsorbable and non biodegradable is moderately affected by the increase in ebct in contrast met which is well adsorbable and biodegradable presented a clearer effect of the ebct on the breakthrough the effect is also visible for cbz which is also well adsorbable and non biodegradable or asp dcf and vlf which are well adsorbable and biodegradable figure xiii supplementary material fig 6 c shows that after a certain time establishment of the biological community c c0 fluctuates instead of becoming constant as expected for a purely adsorptive removal this is an indication of biological activity fundneider et al 2021 and or desorption the influent doc concentration ranged between 4 0 7 9 mg l 6 4 1 0 mg l n 134 so we assume that desorption had a slight influence considering that adequate growth conditions for the biofilm were given substrate and nutrients availability as well as redox conditions fundneider 2020 longer ebcts have also a positive effect on biological processes occurring within the gac filter as an increase in the ebct improves the substrate uptake by the biofilm fig 6 c shows for example that gpt which is poorly adsorbable and biodegradable is removed 2 3 times better at ebct 24 min compared to ebct 6 min the biodegradation of gpt as well as the production of the metabolite gpt l were monitored for all gac filters figure xiv supplementary material this strongly suggests that the gpt removal was almost exclusively attributed to biological processes as already reported by henning et al 2018 sperlich et al 2017 in case of ibs a well adsorbable and moderately biodegradable substance boix et al 2016 the same trend was observed however due to simultaneous occurrence of adsorption and biological processes c c0 fluctuates only slightly 4 conclusions gac filters are an alternative to pac processes for the removal of micropollutants form wastewater full and pilot scale experiments under real conditions were conducted to quantify the effect of ebct on micropollutant uv254nm and doc removal based on the presented results the following conclusions can be drawn the gac type affects the removal of individual micropollutants a balanced proportion of macro meso and micropores may play a role in the better removal of micropollutants in presence of doc ebct does not influence the relative distribution of the cdoc and uv254nm signal in the effluent after a certain qdoc the relative distribution of the cdoc and uv254nm signal in the effluent approaches the one of the influent the ebct is the key factor for the design of gac filters for wastewater treatment the ebct greatly influences the breakthrough point of individual micropollutants doc and uv254nm absorbing substances there is a minimum ebct for the adsorptive removal of micropollutants increasing the ebct leads to a better removal of the micropollutants and to a better utilization of the sorption capacity however after approximately 20 30 min a further increase does not enhance the overall filter performance anymore declaration of

17207,sustainable urban drainage systems suds help in stormwater management by reducing runoff volume increasing runoff concentration time and thereby improving the drainage system capacity this study investigated the potential and cost effectiveness of suds in reducing combined sewer overflows csos we simulated the performance of four suds techniques bioretention cell permeable pavement rain barrel and green roof at incremental levels of spatial coverage for a small urban catchment with a combined sewer system we also used an analytic hierarchy process ahp considering end point cso land use imperviousness slope and elevation criteria to identify priority areas for suds deployment results showed that cso volume attenuation ranged a maximum of 50 99 for the catchment depending on the deployment strategy and underlying mechanisms of each technology we also found that deployment of suds in ahp selected sub catchments improved cso reduction only for rain barrels and green roofs but not for bioretention cells and permeable pavements suds were also a cost effective retrofit option for a 40 volume reduction the suds cost at most 25 of the equivalent cost required for a large cso tank outcomes of this study demonstrate the efficacy of suds in controlling csos adding yet another tangible benefit to their increasingly recognised multi functionality graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords analytic hierarchy process ahp combined sewer system life cycle costing lcc storm water management model swmm urban drainage modelling 1 introduction combined sewer systems capture and convey both stormwater and municipal sewage through a single sewer line towards a central treatment facility typically only a limited amount of stormwater is processed in the treatment plant anything that exceeds this capacity is directly released to the receiving water body through designated storage and overflow structures a process referred to as combined sewer overflows csos csos have garnered much interest around the world since many cities have combined sewer systems in place komínková et al 2016 llopart mascaró et al 2015 xu et al 2018 csos adversely impact water quality and are considered one of the leading causes of urban surface water pollution copetti et al 2018 passerat et al 2011 riechel et al 2016 weyrauch et al 2010 xu et al 2018 exceeded drainage capacity can also lead to urban floods which might cause traffic disruption economic damage and jeopardise human health qin et al 2013 both issues csos and exceeded drainage capacity are proliferated in expanding urban areas in which the increase in impervious coverage puts a strain on existing drainage infrastructure and shortens catchment response time thereby bringing reduced infiltration higher flood magnitudes and shorter flood duration martin mikle et al 2015 traditionally cso and urban flood reduction measures have a strong focus on the expansion of buffer volume or conveyance capacities of existing sewer systems tavakol davani et al 2016 wan and lemmon 2007 integrated approaches have also assessed the combined control of sewer and wastewater treatment plant to maximise in sewer storage thereby prolonging the need for additional new infrastructure erbe and schütze 2005 langeveld et al 2013 however many of these highly engineered grey approaches are costly and largely focus on collecting and removing waters from urban areas montalto et al 2007 tavakol davani et al 2016 over decades the application of distributed runoff management strategies has gained traction in which stormwater runoff volume and peak time are controlled by reducing surface imperviousness increasing infiltration and retention as well as reusing stormwater on or near the site of runoff generation lund et al 2019 qin et al 2013 these measures are collectively known using different terminologies such as sustainable drainage system suds water sensitive urban design wsud low impact development lid best management practices bmps green infrastructure gi or stormwater control measures scms amongst other terms the use of which depends upon the context region and the primary focus of these measures fletcher et al 2015 irrespective of the terminology these measures comprise structural i e physical infrastructure and non structural i e policy planning controls education and operational measures to manage drainage systems while also providing additional benefits such as alternative water supply and improvements in amenity biodiversity water quality and urban micro climate fletcher et al 2015 riechel et al 2016 amongst other ecosystem services kuller et al 2017 selected examples of such suds the term we henceforth use to refer to these interventions include permeable pavements green roofs bioretention cells and rain barrels literature can be found assessing on the one hand the efficacy of suds under different rainfall characteristics and at different spatial extents in reducing csos and on the other hand the impact of their spatial arrangement on cso reduction outcomes for example qin et al 2013 presented the application of suds in a district in shenzhen china in which swales permeable pavement and green roofs were able to reduce local urban flooding under rainfall storms of different return periods duration and peak ratios tao et al 2017 concluded that suds were effective in reducing peak urban runoff and cso volume for low intensity and short duration rainfall events but not for high intensity events freni et al 2010 have compared the performance of infiltration based suds termed distributed bmp solution in their study with a centralised storage grey option and a mixed option distributed bmp combined with centralised storage concluding that centralised storage was more robust and effective this is in contrast to the conclusions of a comprehensive study by lucas and sample 2015 that compared cso reduction performance of grey infrastructure storage against suds termed gi in their paper with and without outlet control for a high intensity rainfall event they concluded that while grey infrastructure was better able to reduce cso frequency cso volume was better attenuated with outlet controlled suds many of these studies are useful yet at times provide conflicting insights into suds performance in reducing csos warranting further research into their efficacy system configuration and the key underlying mechanism affecting their performance this knowledge gap constitutes the fundamental basis of this paper furthermore many of these studies which use modelling as their primary methodology adopt event based simulations to make inferences about cso reduction processes tao et al 2017 tavakol davani et al 2016 simulating with a continuous long term rainfall data however would allow for a clearer more comprehensive analysis as it better captures the variations in the rainfall patterns and the subsequent hydrological changes yielding more accurate approximations of the hydrographs grimaldi et al 2012 and in turn the interaction of suds and cso outfalls lucas and sample 2015 the second thematic in the literature focuses on the deployment strategy i e the spatial arrangement of suds which is typically based upon design manuals and guidelines for example connecticut department of environmental protection dep 2011 and spatial planning tools for examples uwot by makropoulos et al 2008 and urbanbeats by bach et al 2020 that leverage appropriate land use type slope soil properties and elevation most of these tools however often aim for a broader perspective of stormwater management usually reducing urban runoff and or increasing the time of runoff concentration and do not explicitly focus on the requirements for cso reduction kuller et al 2017 makropoulos et al 2008 the design planning and deployment of suds thus rely upon tools that offer only an implicit guideline for cso reduction an exception to this is the spatial planning approach by fu et al 2019 which considers cso location as one of its design criteria but suffers drawbacks when defining its role for cso reduction this raises questions as to whether existing design criteria and guidelines for suds deployment are also effective and applicable for cso reduction the lack of attention to this objective in existing approaches is a key knowledge worth understanding as it would allow better quantification of a potential functionality of suds that appears to be overlooked amongst its many other benefits and further contribute its business case this paper aims to investigate the impact of suds implementation on csos in particular we address the aforementioned knowledge gaps through three specific objectives i elicit the long term efficacy 35 years of suds in reducing csos encompassing events with varying rainfall patterns ii assess the impact of spatial deployment strategies for suds i e targeting selective sub catchments as opposed to uniform catchment wide implementation and iii understand the cost effectiveness of suds from a life cycle costing perspective in particular we adapt the methodology of montalto et al 2007 tavakol davani et al 2016 and johnson and geisendorf 2019 to compare different types of suds our study is limited to four common suds technologies bioretention systems rain barrels porous pavements and green roofs these represent the most relevant suds processes retention storage infiltration and their combination and therefore the methodology is transferable to other measures 2 material methods 2 1 overview an overview of this study is illustrated in fig 1 all spatial analyses e g terrain processing for selecting sites for suds implementation or calculating roof areas was performed in arcgis desktop v10 6 hereafter referred to as gis adapting the methodology proposed by jack 2012 and ahiablame shakya 2016 hydrologic hydraulic simulation was performed using us epa s storm water management model epa swmm v5 1 hereafter referred to as swmm rossman 2010 2015 the first part of the study involved the setup and calibration of an urban drainage model of the fehraltorf sewer catchment as our case study described in section 2 2 using topographical data and the pre existing sewer network originally developed in swmm by keller 2016 we calibrated and validated the model against available data on flow conditions therein blumensaat et al 2019 used as our reference scenario which we compare to scenarios of suds implementation more details in section 2 3 then we simulated the model using a continuous 35 year rainfall time series section 2 4 in which different suds interventions were included section 2 5 1 and their performance evaluated against reference flows firstly for different rainfall events of varying intensity duration and volume as identified within the time series and subsequently over a long term period section 2 5 2 in determining if implementing suds in selected sub catchments was more beneficial than distributing them uniformly throughout the entire catchment we used the analytic hierarchy process ahp in which different locational criteria were considered to identify a ranking of specific sites to deploy suds described in section 2 5 3 finally a cost effectiveness analysis of suds techniques was conducted to compare the life cycle cost lcc incurred for cso reduction described in section 2 6 2 2 case study description the fehraltorf catchment is located 15 km east of zurich switzerland about 82 ha of the municipality is connected to a combined sewer system shown in fig 2 domestic sewage generated from fehraltorf and two neighbouring municipalities rumlikon and russikon not shown in fig 2 are collected and conveyed together with stormwater runoff to a treatment plant with a maximum treatment capacity of 180 ls 1 during large storm events when the conveyance and the treatment capacities are exceeded sewage overflow is directly released from the cso structures triangles in fig 2 to rohrbach and luppmen creeks that flow through the catchment we selected the fehraltorf catchment as our case study as it is of a reasonable size to conduct an exploratory analysis using long term simulation the catchment also has a rich existing data set with which we can set up and calibrate our urban drainage model blumensaat et al 2019 keller 2016 including a well documented spatial database of sewer assets 2 3 urban drainage model all hydrodynamic analyses in the study were performed using a sewer network model implemented in swmm by keller et al 2016 the model includes 246 sub catchments that drain into 427 junction nodes manholes connected by 431 links conduits and seven cso structures as shown in fig 2 the infiltration process was simulated using the hortonian model which implies the generation of an overland flow when precipitation exceeds the infiltration rate routing was simulated using the dynamic wave method groundwater infiltration into the drainage system was included in terms of monthly values keller 2016 for dry weather flows municipal sewage hourly variations for different days of a week were included keller 2016 the swmm model was calibrated by changing the manning s coefficient infiltration rates and depression storage for both permeable and impermeable fractions of all the sub catchments table s1 in the supplementary material for the calibration and validation processes rainfall and flow observation data of 1 minute temporal resolution between february 10 2016 and june 28 2018 were used blumensaat et al 2019 we compared the observed and simulated flows at the inlet of the treatment plant for which the flows from two areas located upstream russikon and rumlikon were also included as separate direct inflows in swmm since the measured flow included inflows from all three municipalities model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash sutcliffe 1970 presented in section s1 in the supplementary material the model calibration and validation results depicted in fig s1 shows a good approximation of low flows but the peaks were under represented hence the relatively low nse coefficients nse 0 74 for calibration and nse 0 44 and 0 24 for validation however considering that we are making relative assessments of the changes in the cso events due to suds implementation we believe the calibrated model serves as an adequate baseline for benchmarking the suds scenarios since the flow dynamics are well replicated by the model 2 4 rainfall data for long term simulation a 35 year long rainfall time series between january 1st 1981 to december 31st 2016 at a 10 minute temporal resolution was used from the station in kloten 20 km away from the study site downloaded from the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss repository we assumed an intra arrival time of four hours for event based simulation gaál et al 2014 staufer et al 2012 and that the rainfall events had a minimum sum of 12 mm a minimum duration of three hours and a threshold 10 minute peak intensity of 0 7 mm to limit the number of rainfall events this results in 600 rain events over the 35 years from the long term simulation we filtered out the performance of suds for three contrasting rainfall events to analyse their performance in reducing csos 1 41 1 mm 2 83 day rain event in january 2001 that had the highest rainfall duration 2 31 7 mm 7 33 h rain event of may 1988 that had the highest intensity 109 7 mm h and 3 107 9 mm 1 6 day rain event of september 1987 that had the highest volume 2 5 suds deployment and simulation scenarios 2 5 1 a general impression of suds in swmm in this study four suds techniques were considered bioretention cells green roofs permeable pavements and rain barrels we chose these systems because of their scalability allowing for local scale implementation and their contrasting underlying functionality for stormwater management rossman 2015 2010 allowing for a broader understanding of how their different mechanisms of suds can support cso reduction if at all for instance bioretention cells primarily offer infiltration and evapotranspiration whereas rain barrels only store stormwater from rooftops before releasing to the pervious fraction of the sub catchments permeable pavements detain water temporarily before releasing slowly from the underdrain into the sub catchment outlet whereas green roofs behave similar to bioretention cells except that they capture only direct rainfall but no runon from roofs from which water infiltrates into the underlying soil and drainage mat in swmm these suds techniques are represented using a combination of vertical layers of surface soil and storage fig 3 a rossman 2015 the surface receives run on and direct rainfall as inflows water is lost through runoff evapotranspiration et and infiltration into the soil layer the latter constitutes an amended soil mix from which water may be lost through et and can percolate into the underlying storage layer rossman 2015 this layer comprises coarse stone or gravel from which water is lost either by infiltration into natural soil layer or by outflow through an underdrain commonly a perforated pipe table 1 shows the characteristics of the suds considered in the study using typical values found in the literature such as rossman 2015 and chui et al 2016 further details on the suds techniques are provided in section s2 2 5 2 scenario 1 deployment across all sub catchments the first deployment strategy was to target the runoff generated from the impervious fraction of the sub catchment as illustrated in fig 3b which shows that the runoff from impervious fraction surfaces was specified to be diverted to the suds the outlet of the suds as overflow or underdrain was set differently for each suds based on its working mechanism the performance of suds techniques was assessed in terms of cso volume and frequency at varying incremental spatial coverage that ranged from 0 to 100 with non linear increment for each of the suds the values of coverage can be understood as following all sub catchments contain different amounts of pervious and impervious fractions and a different number of buildings and roof areas therefore a 5 coverage of permeable pavement would mean replacing 5 of impervious areas not counting the building or roof area of all sub catchments by the pavements similarly a 10 coverage of rain barrels would imply installing rain barrels at 10 of the households in all the sub catchments a 100 implementation represents the best possible case for the four suds at the given configuration which can be argued to be unlikely to be met in the municipality especially for bioretention cells and permeable pavements however it is expected that its outcome will serve as a benchmark to compare the cso reduction for all other scenarios further details on calculations of suds spatial coverage is provided in section s3 in this first implementation scenario our analysis entailed simulating using a 35 year long rainfall data from which we reported the cso outfalls first for selected rainfall events with different key characteristics see section 2 4 and then for the entire 35 year period to compute total cso volume and average annual frequency a cso event was assumed when the flow rate in the system exceeded 180 ls 1 the maximum capacity of the treatment plant to distinguish one cso event from another an intra event time of four hours was further assumed gaál et al 2014 staufer et al 2012 the total cso volume was computed by adding the volume of overflow water from the cso structures for all the 35 years the average annual cso frequency by dividing the total number of cso events by 35 years for the uncertainty analysis of cso reduction the performance was recorded for the four suds options when the two most sensitive parameters for each suds option were changed to their maximum and minimum values table 1 and the results compared with those obtained using typical parameter values at the inflection point of the cso reduction curve for the four suds techniques 2 5 3 scenario 2 deployment in selected sub catchments the second implementation scenario aimed at mimicking an engineering approach to identify the most suitable areas for suds implementation the sub catchments for priority deployment are chosen using different criteria such as but not limited to the topography of the area land use land availability and soil properties the influence of these factors differs from one geographical location to another which calls for an analytic tool to systematically rank these variables based on their relative importance analytic hierarchy process ahp is one such tool that has been used extensively to rank multiple criteria and their sub criteria of same or different units to create a relative importance hierarchy to establish coefficients using a set of eigenvectors section s4 and identify appropriate locations where suds can be most effective ahammed et al 2012 jack 2012 we performed two sets of ahp study first only four major criteria land use imperviousness slope and elevation were considered with a set of sub criteria for each of these fig 4 of the four primary criteria used land use was assigned the highest importance followed by imperviousness slope and elevation respectively thereby prioritising source runoff control at residential areas at relatively higher elevations these criteria sub criteria and their relative importance their ranks and relative weights were assigned based on available gis data literature recommendations connecticut department of environmental protection dep 2011 eckart et al 2017 and prior knowledge and experience of the co authors of this study note that we only used this approach of selecting the criteria and assigning the weights to implement the suds systematically in spatially appropriate locations and not to make the suds selection second we also included the end point cso criterion which considers the cso structures that each of the sub catchment ultimately drains into the objective of this assignment was to determine if the location of cso structures played a role in cso mitigation each of the criteria and their relative importance were first ranked using a numeric scale of 1 least important to 5 highly important followed by constructing a pair wise chart and then computing eigenvectors to assign coefficients to the primary criteria the eigenvectors were used to transform the relative weights into normalised coefficients based on a 0 to 1 scale jack 2012 the construction of the pair wise matrix and the computation of eigenvectors were repeated for every criterion and sub criterion fig 4 we determined suitable sites for suds deployment using raster overlay analysis of the weighted criteria from previous steps in gis to calculate the site suitability index ssi using the additive approach in eq 1 1 ssi β c v c where ssi site suitability index for suds c end point cso land use imperviousness slope elevation βc variable coefficients eigenvectors of the criteria vc product of the sub criteria weights and their variable coefficients in the equation the β values are the variable coefficients eigenvectors whereas the v values are the product of the sub criteria weights and their coefficients for example high imperviousness 60 criterion has a coefficient of 0 4254 fig 4 thus an individual raster cell of imperviousness rating of 70 has a v value of 0 70 0 4254 0 2978 for imperviousness the β value is 0 3045 and so the compound variable β v is 0 3045 0 2978 this was done for all criteria and sub criteria and added to obtain a suitability index for each raster cell finally the raster cells were classified using natural breaks into five relative categories in gis ranging from least suitable to most suitable for suds implementation based on their ssi values jack 2012 for the second ahp study the end point cso criterion was assigned a weight of 0 5 and the other criteria the half the values assigned in the first ahp study in this case the corresponding sub criteria to the seven cso structures were assigned proportional weights based on the volume of outfalls from each of these to determine if incorporation of suds in selected sub catchments was more effective than distributing them uniformly throughout all sub catchments a comparison was made between the cso volume reduction when equivalent areas of each of the four suds techniques were incorporated in the two sets of ahp identified sub catchments versus when they were incorporated uniformly in all sub catchments this means that the cso reduction after implementing for example permeable pavements covering 2 5 ha in the 35 ahp identified sub catchments were compared against when an equivalent area was implemented in all sub catchments 2 6 cost effectiveness analysis although technical assessment of the suds in cso reduction may explain the physical processes their implementation in practice is bound to be determined by the financial investments as well to this end we analysed the cost effectiveness of the suds by calculating the life cycle cost lcc required for each of the suds the lcc analysis included the installation and operation and management o m of the suds over different life spans as shown in table 2 decommissioning costs of suds were not included assuming that they will be rehabilitated during or beyond their functional life span which either occurs beyond the planning horizon of the economic analysis or becomes a negligible amount after discounting the horizon was taken to be 40 years the lowest common multiple of the life span of the suds techniques park 2013 all suds implementation were assumed to occur at year zero taken as 2019 and the o m costs were assumed to be 1 5 of the installation costs montalto et al 2007 the life cycle costs incurred were evaluated and compared for analysis of cost effectiveness using the net present value npv eq 2 with a discount rate of 2 a typical value used for swiss urban water infrastructure logar et al 2014 2 npv i 0 n f v i 1 r i where fvi future value of the cost at year i us r discount rate n planning horizon years to determine the cost effectiveness of suds against a typical grey option we also compared the npvs of different sizes of cso tanks small medium and large yielding 25 35 and 40 cso volume reduction as described by montalto et al 2007 here the comparison is simply based on the costs incurred for the respective cso volume reduced from a single cso tank as if all flows from the municipality is drained to it this is a simplistic comparison since the number size and spatial distribution and also the different costs for construction of tanks is disregarded that nevertheless predisposes a tentative idea of the cost effectiveness of the suds techniques in comparison to the grey option 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of suds during selected rainfall events the performance of suds during the three selected rainfall events described in section 2 4 were compared in terms of the changes in the hydrographs representing cso outflows as illustrated in fig 5 the hydrographs and the cso exceedance probability curves for the high duration rainfall event in january 2001 fig 5a and 5b depict a clear reduction in cso outflow for bioretention cells and permeable pavements throughout the rainfall event including the peak rainfall of 6 mm h in which the peak flow rates were shaved off by 80 and 74 respectively and reduced below the threshold value of 180 ls 1 the high duration rainfall event was steady but not intense at no point in time during this storm event did the precipitation rate exceed the infiltration rate in bioretention cells that precluded the generation of an infiltration excess runoff as for permeable pavements the attenuation was largely from infiltration of water into the storage bottom and the bypass of infiltration excess runoff into the pervious fraction although rain barrels and green roofs showed considerable reductions in the peak outflows as well nearly 34 the outflows still exceeded the threshold the persistent intense rainfall may likely have filled the barrels and fully saturated the roofs hydrographs for the high intensity rainfall event which had a spell of intense rain and a dry spell before and after the peak showed a peak outflow over 8200 ls 1 for the reference condition fig 5c the peak was reduced when bioretention cells were implemented during which dry antecedent soil moisture conditions allowed for water to infiltrate at a maximum rate although permeable pavements reduced peak outflow by nearly 97 to 241 ls 1 fig 5d the rainfall event was too intense to attenuate the outflow below the threshold value likewise green roofs and rain barrels also showed limited impact peak outflow was reduced by 68 and 55 to 2645 ls 1 and 3670 ls 1 respectively for the high volume rainfall event of september 1987 fig 5e and 5f the reference case showed a peak flow of 1537 ls 1 in this case as well only bioretention cells were able to reduce peak flow and this reduction was largely due to runoff attenuation brought about by surface infiltration for the first few hours followed by percolation and exfiltration into the natural soil for permeable pavements there was an outflow due to both infiltration excess runoff as well as a delayed release from the storage layer for green roofs the intense sustained rainfall allowed only a marginal reduction in csos interestingly peak cso outflow for rain barrels exceeded the reference case possibly because the barrels were filled by persistent steady rainfall before the peak occurred causing the overflow to spill over the previous fraction this alongside the runoff from the impervious fraction for the sustained rainfall as well as flows from the underdrain of the barrels may have caused the peak cso flow rate to even exceed the reference value these results highlight that cso attenuation is limited during high rainfall duration and intensity echoing the conclusions drawn by tao et al 2017 antecedent conditions of soil and composite suds layers also seem to play a significant role in determining the occurrence of csos thereby highlighting the importance of using long term rainfall data for event based analyses 3 2 effectiveness of suds in reducing csos the responses of the four suds to the selected rainfall events section 3 1 also help explain their overall effectiveness in reducing cso volume and frequency for all precipitation data between 1981 and 2016 see fig 6 the figure elucidates that each of the suds technologies with their different dimensions dissimilar working mechanism and unique deployment requirements exhibited contrasting efficiencies in cso reduction the performance also depended on the volume of water direct rainfall runoff or runon routed to the suds bioretention cells deployed in the permeable fractions of the sub catchments received direct rainfall and runoff from the entire impervious fraction of the sub catchments infiltration and et of water from the composite layers as well as the exfiltration of water into natural soil resulted in a notable csos reduction despite a mere 2 spatial coverage of the bioretention cells cso volume reduction exceeded 71 fig 6a further increasing the spatial coverages of the bioretention cells exceeded that of the impervious areas in the sub catchments resulting in a diminishing return of cso volume reduction when spatial coverage was increased to 30 equivalent to roughly 14 ha cso volume reduction increased logarithmically to nearly 99 and the number of annual cso events was reduced to one which can be argued based on fig 5 to have occurred during an intense rainfall event permeable pavements were implemented in the impervious fractions of the sub catchments thereby reducing the surface runoff generation in all rainfall events excluding those of high intensity and long duration fig 5 as such total cso volume reduction was only about 86 even at 100 coverage fig 6b the trend for cso reduction was also somewhat different there was logarithmic growth in cso volume reduction up to a 30 coverage 6 ha followed by a linear increase in which we anticipate that cso events arising from all but highly intense rainfall events were attenuated rain barrels and green roofs both showed incremental improvement in cso reduction with an increase in spatial extents fig 6c and d respectively it is also interesting to note that although green roofs were better able to reduce cso volume rain barrels fared better in reducing cso frequency 41 annual events for green roofs against 39 events for rain barrels at 100 coverage green roofs like bioretention cells offer evapotranspiration and infiltration except that they receive only direct rainfall the evaporation of waters from the roofs may have led to a higher reduction in cso volumes on the other hand rain barrels only offered temporary storage of stored water the delayed release may have led to a higher reduction in cso frequencies and since they did not have et the volume reduction was relatively lower the uncertainty analysis using the range of minimum and maximum parameter values presented in table 3 show that bioretention cells exhibited the highest deviation due to a wide range of design depth configurations available for the soil layer that greatly affects the infiltration and evapotranspiration processes interestingly increasing the height of rain barrels inversely affected the cso volume reduction process the comparison at different rainfall events for large and small tank sizes shown in section s5 show that large tanks fared well during short bursts of intense rainfall and relatively poorly when the rainfall was steady but not intense in fact the times at which the flows from larger tanks exceeded the smaller tanks were not when the rain subsided they occurred during the rainfall this could possibly be because the tank might have been filled when the rainfall occurred as the tanks were emptying gradually when large tanks were more filled than smaller tanks any occurrence of rainfall could have resulted in more storage of water in small tanks than in large tanks and hence more spills for the latter 3 3 effectiveness of implementing suds in ahp identified sub catchments the criteria and sub criteria used in the two ahp cases to calculate the ssi identified nearly 14 of the total area to be either most suitable or suitable for the placement of suds fig 7 a in the first case the hierarchy of the criteria and sub criteria as well as the weights assigned to each of these suggested prioritising interventions geared towards source control in urbanised residential areas fig 7a left however given the relatively homogeneous distribution of residential areas fig 2 other criteria elevation and slope may have taken precedence the identified areas were largely concentrated at higher elevations away from the trunk line fig 2 the average imperviousness was about 37 with a mean runoff coefficient of 0 35 in the second case areas contributing to cso 7 sub catchments in the north west were identified as suitable for suds deployment fig 7a right in addition to the sub catchments in the south that were identified from the previous ahp case the comparison of cso volume reduction from the distributed implementation versus that in ahp identified sub catchments is depicted in fig 7b implementing suds in ahp identified sub catchments without considering the end point cso locations was not effective for bioretention cells and permeable pavements the cso reduction for the two suds techniques were 40 and 36 respectively which is considerably lower than in the distributed case 95 and 71 respectively for rain barrels and green roofs the targeted ahp approach showed only a marginal improvement in cso volume reduction the evolution of outflows from the cso structures for an equivalent spatial coverage for the two ahp and distributed cases fig 8 helps explain the results of fig 7b the location of cso structures played an important role those located downstream of the catchment csos 6 and 7 had the two largest outflows nearly 67 for reference case and thus a greater influence on the occurrence of cso events and consequently in the efforts to reduce them the total reduction in cso volume from distributed implementation was caused by a decrease in the outflows from all seven cso structures for all four suds for the ahp case the reduction was largely from cso structures 1 2 and 6 and hardly had any effect on cso 7 resulting in a lower cso reduction in comparison with the distributed case this effect was not as prominent in the case of rain barrels and green roofs because of the relatively sparse distribution of buildings in the areas contributing to csos 6 and 7 the criteria set in the ahp based on design manuals led to the selection of areas where surface runoff was high however by including the end point criterion in the second ahp study the location and distribution of cso structures were given due emphasis leading to suds deployment in several sub catchments that largely drain to csos 6 and 7 this improved the cso volume reduction for all four suds techniques more so for the rain barrels than for other suds which remarkably showed nearly 39 cso reduction in this case targeted deployment disconnects the flows from rooftops preventing or at least delaying flows draining into the cso structures the analysis also shows that the effect of targeted suds deployment for cso reduction cannot be generalised while targeted deployment favour rain barrels and green roofs it is rather beneficial to have bioretention cells and permeable pavements distributed throughout the catchment in other words the deployment can be based on other benefits for suds for example runoff reduction or improvement in amenity and can still yield significant of cso reduction 3 4 cost effectiveness analysis of suds the result of the cost effectiveness analysis is shown in fig 9 in which the curves for each of the four suds show the npvs of the cost incurred for the cso volume reduced for different spatial extents the npvs of the costs of cso tanks of three different sizes montalto et al 2007 are also provided for comparison as described in section 2 6 at first glance npvs of the suds are considerably lower than those for cso tanks for 25 35 and 40 cso volume reduction for example reducing the cso volume by 40 using green roofs for which the npv is the highest amongst the four suds costs only 25 of that required using a large cso tank other suds cost much lower for this level of cso volume reduction although simplistic in the calculation the high disparity in costs between the cso tanks and suds implies that the latter may be considered a cost effective retrofitting option to attenuate outflows amongst the four suds bioretention cells had the highest total unit cost due to incremental conversion of the pervious areas resulting in higher spatial coverage and considerable investments required for the plants soil sand layer gravel and the excavation works considering that costs required for operation and maintenance were assumed to be proportional to the capital investment bioretention cells also had the highest o m cost nearly three times higher than that of the green roof the second highest in the list however the cso volume reduction for bioretention cells was so high even at low spatial coverage and the difference in performance so large over that of other suds that they emerge as high cost high reward option interestingly the curve for bioretention cells showed a clear diminishing return of cso volume reduction for any investment made above us 15 million this represented the upper limit of the cost required to effectively reduce csos in the studied system the analysis also positioned permeable pavements as a cost effective option they delivered high cso reduction for less than half the land area required for bioretention cells they also required lesser excavation depth to accommodate the soil pavement and storage layers 750 mm deep than bioretention cells 900 mm deep which had a much deeper soil layer table 1 this had direct implications in terms of the costs required for excavation gravel or soil sand as shown in table 2 these results are in line with conclusions of liu et al 2015 and liu et al 2016 but contradict that of chui et al 2016 in which permeable pavements were more cost effective than bioretention cells this is because of the differences in the composite layers and design configurations for example the presence or lack thereof of soil sand layer in permeable pavements and in the unit costs of the components in the two papers for example excavation costs thereby emphasising the significance of an uncertainty analysis which we have shown in fig 9 in shaded colours for each of the four suds techniques at the other extreme green roofs were the least cost effective option because of the high investments required for drainage mat and waterproofing in addition to those required for roof protection the soil layer and the operation and maintenance the low cost effectiveness of green roofs for cso reduction also conforms to the conclusions by montalto et al 2007 liu et al 2015 and chui et al 2016 on the other hand rain barrels had the lowest unit cost of the four suds techniques as there were no expenses for waterproofing the soil sand layer or excavation table 2 due to the low capital investment the o m cost was also quite low thus rain barrels despite having the lowest cso attenuation for distributed case were effective for the investments required the cost effectiveness analysis thus facilitated a direct comparison of the four suds techniques which in turn allowed for a new perspective in addition to the technical analysis of cso volume and frequency reduction as observed in the case of rain barrels this corroborates the need for an integrated technical economic assessment for a comprehensive assessment of suds in reducing csos 4 further discussion although our study has established the effectiveness of different suds techniques in reducing csos we acknowledge that the swmm model might profit from further calibration for example different runoff coefficients for different types of surface covers for a better approximation of the peak flows that could in turn yield a more accurate representation of cso events as the measured observed inflows at wwtp were computed indirectly from water level values using manning strickler equation this may also have led to errors in estimating the flows and hence contributed to the relatively low nse values however considering that we are conducting relative assessments of the changes in the cso events due to suds implementation the calibrated model serves as a reasonable baseline for benchmarking the suds scenarios as the flow dynamics are well replicated by the model this is especially relevant since our model comprises various complex hydrological and hydraulic processes the presented simple sensitivity analysis table 3 showed consistent results over the different suds considered in this study the influence of the model parameters that characterise the suds i e the composite layers of the four suds could however warrant further sensitivity analysis the use of threshold criteria of 180 l s 1 to define a cso event is also simplistic as cso structures typically detain excess water before discharge into the receiving water body incorporating this feature of cso structures into the study could result in a more accurate estimation of cso volume and frequency 5 conclusion our study to investigate the performance of suds techniques in reducing csos using a 35 year long rainfall data allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the suds performance for rainfall events of different key characteristics we also investigated if targeting selected few sub catchments for suds implementation was more effective than distributing them uniformly all over the study site finally to determine the cost effectiveness of the suds we used the npv of the life cycle cost to compare the performance of the suds techniques against cso tanks of different sizes all four suds techniques showed considerable reduction in csos although this largely depended upon underlying mechanism and deployment specifically we found that 1 performance under different rainfall events could also be considered robust especially for bioretention cells which significantly attenuated csos including those originating from high intensity and high duration rainfall events other suds techniques showed limited cso reduction during high intensity rainfall events 2 location and distribution of cso structures were crucial in regulating cso outflows for rain barrels and green roofs but the criteria from current design guidelines used in our ahp analysis were valid and significant but were poor guidance for reducing csos 3 cost effectiveness analysis showed that bioretention cells may have the highest return of investment amongst the four suds despite their high unit cost at the other extreme green roofs emerged as the least cost effective option the cost effectiveness analysis also showed a rather high return of investment for rain barrels that could yield a significant cso volume reduction with strategic placement at a considerably low cost nevertheless this study has shown that the potential of suds in controlling csos is undoubtedly significant findings support yet another benefit of such multi functional decentralised measures in integrated urban drainage management and deserve more attention in future research and

17207,sustainable urban drainage systems suds help in stormwater management by reducing runoff volume increasing runoff concentration time and thereby improving the drainage system capacity this study investigated the potential and cost effectiveness of suds in reducing combined sewer overflows csos we simulated the performance of four suds techniques bioretention cell permeable pavement rain barrel and green roof at incremental levels of spatial coverage for a small urban catchment with a combined sewer system we also used an analytic hierarchy process ahp considering end point cso land use imperviousness slope and elevation criteria to identify priority areas for suds deployment results showed that cso volume attenuation ranged a maximum of 50 99 for the catchment depending on the deployment strategy and underlying mechanisms of each technology we also found that deployment of suds in ahp selected sub catchments improved cso reduction only for rain barrels and green roofs but not for bioretention cells and permeable pavements suds were also a cost effective retrofit option for a 40 volume reduction the suds cost at most 25 of the equivalent cost required for a large cso tank outcomes of this study demonstrate the efficacy of suds in controlling csos adding yet another tangible benefit to their increasingly recognised multi functionality graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords analytic hierarchy process ahp combined sewer system life cycle costing lcc storm water management model swmm urban drainage modelling 1 introduction combined sewer systems capture and convey both stormwater and municipal sewage through a single sewer line towards a central treatment facility typically only a limited amount of stormwater is processed in the treatment plant anything that exceeds this capacity is directly released to the receiving water body through designated storage and overflow structures a process referred to as combined sewer overflows csos csos have garnered much interest around the world since many cities have combined sewer systems in place komínková et al 2016 llopart mascaró et al 2015 xu et al 2018 csos adversely impact water quality and are considered one of the leading causes of urban surface water pollution copetti et al 2018 passerat et al 2011 riechel et al 2016 weyrauch et al 2010 xu et al 2018 exceeded drainage capacity can also lead to urban floods which might cause traffic disruption economic damage and jeopardise human health qin et al 2013 both issues csos and exceeded drainage capacity are proliferated in expanding urban areas in which the increase in impervious coverage puts a strain on existing drainage infrastructure and shortens catchment response time thereby bringing reduced infiltration higher flood magnitudes and shorter flood duration martin mikle et al 2015 traditionally cso and urban flood reduction measures have a strong focus on the expansion of buffer volume or conveyance capacities of existing sewer systems tavakol davani et al 2016 wan and lemmon 2007 integrated approaches have also assessed the combined control of sewer and wastewater treatment plant to maximise in sewer storage thereby prolonging the need for additional new infrastructure erbe and schütze 2005 langeveld et al 2013 however many of these highly engineered grey approaches are costly and largely focus on collecting and removing waters from urban areas montalto et al 2007 tavakol davani et al 2016 over decades the application of distributed runoff management strategies has gained traction in which stormwater runoff volume and peak time are controlled by reducing surface imperviousness increasing infiltration and retention as well as reusing stormwater on or near the site of runoff generation lund et al 2019 qin et al 2013 these measures are collectively known using different terminologies such as sustainable drainage system suds water sensitive urban design wsud low impact development lid best management practices bmps green infrastructure gi or stormwater control measures scms amongst other terms the use of which depends upon the context region and the primary focus of these measures fletcher et al 2015 irrespective of the terminology these measures comprise structural i e physical infrastructure and non structural i e policy planning controls education and operational measures to manage drainage systems while also providing additional benefits such as alternative water supply and improvements in amenity biodiversity water quality and urban micro climate fletcher et al 2015 riechel et al 2016 amongst other ecosystem services kuller et al 2017 selected examples of such suds the term we henceforth use to refer to these interventions include permeable pavements green roofs bioretention cells and rain barrels literature can be found assessing on the one hand the efficacy of suds under different rainfall characteristics and at different spatial extents in reducing csos and on the other hand the impact of their spatial arrangement on cso reduction outcomes for example qin et al 2013 presented the application of suds in a district in shenzhen china in which swales permeable pavement and green roofs were able to reduce local urban flooding under rainfall storms of different return periods duration and peak ratios tao et al 2017 concluded that suds were effective in reducing peak urban runoff and cso volume for low intensity and short duration rainfall events but not for high intensity events freni et al 2010 have compared the performance of infiltration based suds termed distributed bmp solution in their study with a centralised storage grey option and a mixed option distributed bmp combined with centralised storage concluding that centralised storage was more robust and effective this is in contrast to the conclusions of a comprehensive study by lucas and sample 2015 that compared cso reduction performance of grey infrastructure storage against suds termed gi in their paper with and without outlet control for a high intensity rainfall event they concluded that while grey infrastructure was better able to reduce cso frequency cso volume was better attenuated with outlet controlled suds many of these studies are useful yet at times provide conflicting insights into suds performance in reducing csos warranting further research into their efficacy system configuration and the key underlying mechanism affecting their performance this knowledge gap constitutes the fundamental basis of this paper furthermore many of these studies which use modelling as their primary methodology adopt event based simulations to make inferences about cso reduction processes tao et al 2017 tavakol davani et al 2016 simulating with a continuous long term rainfall data however would allow for a clearer more comprehensive analysis as it better captures the variations in the rainfall patterns and the subsequent hydrological changes yielding more accurate approximations of the hydrographs grimaldi et al 2012 and in turn the interaction of suds and cso outfalls lucas and sample 2015 the second thematic in the literature focuses on the deployment strategy i e the spatial arrangement of suds which is typically based upon design manuals and guidelines for example connecticut department of environmental protection dep 2011 and spatial planning tools for examples uwot by makropoulos et al 2008 and urbanbeats by bach et al 2020 that leverage appropriate land use type slope soil properties and elevation most of these tools however often aim for a broader perspective of stormwater management usually reducing urban runoff and or increasing the time of runoff concentration and do not explicitly focus on the requirements for cso reduction kuller et al 2017 makropoulos et al 2008 the design planning and deployment of suds thus rely upon tools that offer only an implicit guideline for cso reduction an exception to this is the spatial planning approach by fu et al 2019 which considers cso location as one of its design criteria but suffers drawbacks when defining its role for cso reduction this raises questions as to whether existing design criteria and guidelines for suds deployment are also effective and applicable for cso reduction the lack of attention to this objective in existing approaches is a key knowledge worth understanding as it would allow better quantification of a potential functionality of suds that appears to be overlooked amongst its many other benefits and further contribute its business case this paper aims to investigate the impact of suds implementation on csos in particular we address the aforementioned knowledge gaps through three specific objectives i elicit the long term efficacy 35 years of suds in reducing csos encompassing events with varying rainfall patterns ii assess the impact of spatial deployment strategies for suds i e targeting selective sub catchments as opposed to uniform catchment wide implementation and iii understand the cost effectiveness of suds from a life cycle costing perspective in particular we adapt the methodology of montalto et al 2007 tavakol davani et al 2016 and johnson and geisendorf 2019 to compare different types of suds our study is limited to four common suds technologies bioretention systems rain barrels porous pavements and green roofs these represent the most relevant suds processes retention storage infiltration and their combination and therefore the methodology is transferable to other measures 2 material methods 2 1 overview an overview of this study is illustrated in fig 1 all spatial analyses e g terrain processing for selecting sites for suds implementation or calculating roof areas was performed in arcgis desktop v10 6 hereafter referred to as gis adapting the methodology proposed by jack 2012 and ahiablame shakya 2016 hydrologic hydraulic simulation was performed using us epa s storm water management model epa swmm v5 1 hereafter referred to as swmm rossman 2010 2015 the first part of the study involved the setup and calibration of an urban drainage model of the fehraltorf sewer catchment as our case study described in section 2 2 using topographical data and the pre existing sewer network originally developed in swmm by keller 2016 we calibrated and validated the model against available data on flow conditions therein blumensaat et al 2019 used as our reference scenario which we compare to scenarios of suds implementation more details in section 2 3 then we simulated the model using a continuous 35 year rainfall time series section 2 4 in which different suds interventions were included section 2 5 1 and their performance evaluated against reference flows firstly for different rainfall events of varying intensity duration and volume as identified within the time series and subsequently over a long term period section 2 5 2 in determining if implementing suds in selected sub catchments was more beneficial than distributing them uniformly throughout the entire catchment we used the analytic hierarchy process ahp in which different locational criteria were considered to identify a ranking of specific sites to deploy suds described in section 2 5 3 finally a cost effectiveness analysis of suds techniques was conducted to compare the life cycle cost lcc incurred for cso reduction described in section 2 6 2 2 case study description the fehraltorf catchment is located 15 km east of zurich switzerland about 82 ha of the municipality is connected to a combined sewer system shown in fig 2 domestic sewage generated from fehraltorf and two neighbouring municipalities rumlikon and russikon not shown in fig 2 are collected and conveyed together with stormwater runoff to a treatment plant with a maximum treatment capacity of 180 ls 1 during large storm events when the conveyance and the treatment capacities are exceeded sewage overflow is directly released from the cso structures triangles in fig 2 to rohrbach and luppmen creeks that flow through the catchment we selected the fehraltorf catchment as our case study as it is of a reasonable size to conduct an exploratory analysis using long term simulation the catchment also has a rich existing data set with which we can set up and calibrate our urban drainage model blumensaat et al 2019 keller 2016 including a well documented spatial database of sewer assets 2 3 urban drainage model all hydrodynamic analyses in the study were performed using a sewer network model implemented in swmm by keller et al 2016 the model includes 246 sub catchments that drain into 427 junction nodes manholes connected by 431 links conduits and seven cso structures as shown in fig 2 the infiltration process was simulated using the hortonian model which implies the generation of an overland flow when precipitation exceeds the infiltration rate routing was simulated using the dynamic wave method groundwater infiltration into the drainage system was included in terms of monthly values keller 2016 for dry weather flows municipal sewage hourly variations for different days of a week were included keller 2016 the swmm model was calibrated by changing the manning s coefficient infiltration rates and depression storage for both permeable and impermeable fractions of all the sub catchments table s1 in the supplementary material for the calibration and validation processes rainfall and flow observation data of 1 minute temporal resolution between february 10 2016 and june 28 2018 were used blumensaat et al 2019 we compared the observed and simulated flows at the inlet of the treatment plant for which the flows from two areas located upstream russikon and rumlikon were also included as separate direct inflows in swmm since the measured flow included inflows from all three municipalities model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash sutcliffe 1970 presented in section s1 in the supplementary material the model calibration and validation results depicted in fig s1 shows a good approximation of low flows but the peaks were under represented hence the relatively low nse coefficients nse 0 74 for calibration and nse 0 44 and 0 24 for validation however considering that we are making relative assessments of the changes in the cso events due to suds implementation we believe the calibrated model serves as an adequate baseline for benchmarking the suds scenarios since the flow dynamics are well replicated by the model 2 4 rainfall data for long term simulation a 35 year long rainfall time series between january 1st 1981 to december 31st 2016 at a 10 minute temporal resolution was used from the station in kloten 20 km away from the study site downloaded from the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss repository we assumed an intra arrival time of four hours for event based simulation gaál et al 2014 staufer et al 2012 and that the rainfall events had a minimum sum of 12 mm a minimum duration of three hours and a threshold 10 minute peak intensity of 0 7 mm to limit the number of rainfall events this results in 600 rain events over the 35 years from the long term simulation we filtered out the performance of suds for three contrasting rainfall events to analyse their performance in reducing csos 1 41 1 mm 2 83 day rain event in january 2001 that had the highest rainfall duration 2 31 7 mm 7 33 h rain event of may 1988 that had the highest intensity 109 7 mm h and 3 107 9 mm 1 6 day rain event of september 1987 that had the highest volume 2 5 suds deployment and simulation scenarios 2 5 1 a general impression of suds in swmm in this study four suds techniques were considered bioretention cells green roofs permeable pavements and rain barrels we chose these systems because of their scalability allowing for local scale implementation and their contrasting underlying functionality for stormwater management rossman 2015 2010 allowing for a broader understanding of how their different mechanisms of suds can support cso reduction if at all for instance bioretention cells primarily offer infiltration and evapotranspiration whereas rain barrels only store stormwater from rooftops before releasing to the pervious fraction of the sub catchments permeable pavements detain water temporarily before releasing slowly from the underdrain into the sub catchment outlet whereas green roofs behave similar to bioretention cells except that they capture only direct rainfall but no runon from roofs from which water infiltrates into the underlying soil and drainage mat in swmm these suds techniques are represented using a combination of vertical layers of surface soil and storage fig 3 a rossman 2015 the surface receives run on and direct rainfall as inflows water is lost through runoff evapotranspiration et and infiltration into the soil layer the latter constitutes an amended soil mix from which water may be lost through et and can percolate into the underlying storage layer rossman 2015 this layer comprises coarse stone or gravel from which water is lost either by infiltration into natural soil layer or by outflow through an underdrain commonly a perforated pipe table 1 shows the characteristics of the suds considered in the study using typical values found in the literature such as rossman 2015 and chui et al 2016 further details on the suds techniques are provided in section s2 2 5 2 scenario 1 deployment across all sub catchments the first deployment strategy was to target the runoff generated from the impervious fraction of the sub catchment as illustrated in fig 3b which shows that the runoff from impervious fraction surfaces was specified to be diverted to the suds the outlet of the suds as overflow or underdrain was set differently for each suds based on its working mechanism the performance of suds techniques was assessed in terms of cso volume and frequency at varying incremental spatial coverage that ranged from 0 to 100 with non linear increment for each of the suds the values of coverage can be understood as following all sub catchments contain different amounts of pervious and impervious fractions and a different number of buildings and roof areas therefore a 5 coverage of permeable pavement would mean replacing 5 of impervious areas not counting the building or roof area of all sub catchments by the pavements similarly a 10 coverage of rain barrels would imply installing rain barrels at 10 of the households in all the sub catchments a 100 implementation represents the best possible case for the four suds at the given configuration which can be argued to be unlikely to be met in the municipality especially for bioretention cells and permeable pavements however it is expected that its outcome will serve as a benchmark to compare the cso reduction for all other scenarios further details on calculations of suds spatial coverage is provided in section s3 in this first implementation scenario our analysis entailed simulating using a 35 year long rainfall data from which we reported the cso outfalls first for selected rainfall events with different key characteristics see section 2 4 and then for the entire 35 year period to compute total cso volume and average annual frequency a cso event was assumed when the flow rate in the system exceeded 180 ls 1 the maximum capacity of the treatment plant to distinguish one cso event from another an intra event time of four hours was further assumed gaál et al 2014 staufer et al 2012 the total cso volume was computed by adding the volume of overflow water from the cso structures for all the 35 years the average annual cso frequency by dividing the total number of cso events by 35 years for the uncertainty analysis of cso reduction the performance was recorded for the four suds options when the two most sensitive parameters for each suds option were changed to their maximum and minimum values table 1 and the results compared with those obtained using typical parameter values at the inflection point of the cso reduction curve for the four suds techniques 2 5 3 scenario 2 deployment in selected sub catchments the second implementation scenario aimed at mimicking an engineering approach to identify the most suitable areas for suds implementation the sub catchments for priority deployment are chosen using different criteria such as but not limited to the topography of the area land use land availability and soil properties the influence of these factors differs from one geographical location to another which calls for an analytic tool to systematically rank these variables based on their relative importance analytic hierarchy process ahp is one such tool that has been used extensively to rank multiple criteria and their sub criteria of same or different units to create a relative importance hierarchy to establish coefficients using a set of eigenvectors section s4 and identify appropriate locations where suds can be most effective ahammed et al 2012 jack 2012 we performed two sets of ahp study first only four major criteria land use imperviousness slope and elevation were considered with a set of sub criteria for each of these fig 4 of the four primary criteria used land use was assigned the highest importance followed by imperviousness slope and elevation respectively thereby prioritising source runoff control at residential areas at relatively higher elevations these criteria sub criteria and their relative importance their ranks and relative weights were assigned based on available gis data literature recommendations connecticut department of environmental protection dep 2011 eckart et al 2017 and prior knowledge and experience of the co authors of this study note that we only used this approach of selecting the criteria and assigning the weights to implement the suds systematically in spatially appropriate locations and not to make the suds selection second we also included the end point cso criterion which considers the cso structures that each of the sub catchment ultimately drains into the objective of this assignment was to determine if the location of cso structures played a role in cso mitigation each of the criteria and their relative importance were first ranked using a numeric scale of 1 least important to 5 highly important followed by constructing a pair wise chart and then computing eigenvectors to assign coefficients to the primary criteria the eigenvectors were used to transform the relative weights into normalised coefficients based on a 0 to 1 scale jack 2012 the construction of the pair wise matrix and the computation of eigenvectors were repeated for every criterion and sub criterion fig 4 we determined suitable sites for suds deployment using raster overlay analysis of the weighted criteria from previous steps in gis to calculate the site suitability index ssi using the additive approach in eq 1 1 ssi β c v c where ssi site suitability index for suds c end point cso land use imperviousness slope elevation βc variable coefficients eigenvectors of the criteria vc product of the sub criteria weights and their variable coefficients in the equation the β values are the variable coefficients eigenvectors whereas the v values are the product of the sub criteria weights and their coefficients for example high imperviousness 60 criterion has a coefficient of 0 4254 fig 4 thus an individual raster cell of imperviousness rating of 70 has a v value of 0 70 0 4254 0 2978 for imperviousness the β value is 0 3045 and so the compound variable β v is 0 3045 0 2978 this was done for all criteria and sub criteria and added to obtain a suitability index for each raster cell finally the raster cells were classified using natural breaks into five relative categories in gis ranging from least suitable to most suitable for suds implementation based on their ssi values jack 2012 for the second ahp study the end point cso criterion was assigned a weight of 0 5 and the other criteria the half the values assigned in the first ahp study in this case the corresponding sub criteria to the seven cso structures were assigned proportional weights based on the volume of outfalls from each of these to determine if incorporation of suds in selected sub catchments was more effective than distributing them uniformly throughout all sub catchments a comparison was made between the cso volume reduction when equivalent areas of each of the four suds techniques were incorporated in the two sets of ahp identified sub catchments versus when they were incorporated uniformly in all sub catchments this means that the cso reduction after implementing for example permeable pavements covering 2 5 ha in the 35 ahp identified sub catchments were compared against when an equivalent area was implemented in all sub catchments 2 6 cost effectiveness analysis although technical assessment of the suds in cso reduction may explain the physical processes their implementation in practice is bound to be determined by the financial investments as well to this end we analysed the cost effectiveness of the suds by calculating the life cycle cost lcc required for each of the suds the lcc analysis included the installation and operation and management o m of the suds over different life spans as shown in table 2 decommissioning costs of suds were not included assuming that they will be rehabilitated during or beyond their functional life span which either occurs beyond the planning horizon of the economic analysis or becomes a negligible amount after discounting the horizon was taken to be 40 years the lowest common multiple of the life span of the suds techniques park 2013 all suds implementation were assumed to occur at year zero taken as 2019 and the o m costs were assumed to be 1 5 of the installation costs montalto et al 2007 the life cycle costs incurred were evaluated and compared for analysis of cost effectiveness using the net present value npv eq 2 with a discount rate of 2 a typical value used for swiss urban water infrastructure logar et al 2014 2 npv i 0 n f v i 1 r i where fvi future value of the cost at year i us r discount rate n planning horizon years to determine the cost effectiveness of suds against a typical grey option we also compared the npvs of different sizes of cso tanks small medium and large yielding 25 35 and 40 cso volume reduction as described by montalto et al 2007 here the comparison is simply based on the costs incurred for the respective cso volume reduced from a single cso tank as if all flows from the municipality is drained to it this is a simplistic comparison since the number size and spatial distribution and also the different costs for construction of tanks is disregarded that nevertheless predisposes a tentative idea of the cost effectiveness of the suds techniques in comparison to the grey option 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of suds during selected rainfall events the performance of suds during the three selected rainfall events described in section 2 4 were compared in terms of the changes in the hydrographs representing cso outflows as illustrated in fig 5 the hydrographs and the cso exceedance probability curves for the high duration rainfall event in january 2001 fig 5a and 5b depict a clear reduction in cso outflow for bioretention cells and permeable pavements throughout the rainfall event including the peak rainfall of 6 mm h in which the peak flow rates were shaved off by 80 and 74 respectively and reduced below the threshold value of 180 ls 1 the high duration rainfall event was steady but not intense at no point in time during this storm event did the precipitation rate exceed the infiltration rate in bioretention cells that precluded the generation of an infiltration excess runoff as for permeable pavements the attenuation was largely from infiltration of water into the storage bottom and the bypass of infiltration excess runoff into the pervious fraction although rain barrels and green roofs showed considerable reductions in the peak outflows as well nearly 34 the outflows still exceeded the threshold the persistent intense rainfall may likely have filled the barrels and fully saturated the roofs hydrographs for the high intensity rainfall event which had a spell of intense rain and a dry spell before and after the peak showed a peak outflow over 8200 ls 1 for the reference condition fig 5c the peak was reduced when bioretention cells were implemented during which dry antecedent soil moisture conditions allowed for water to infiltrate at a maximum rate although permeable pavements reduced peak outflow by nearly 97 to 241 ls 1 fig 5d the rainfall event was too intense to attenuate the outflow below the threshold value likewise green roofs and rain barrels also showed limited impact peak outflow was reduced by 68 and 55 to 2645 ls 1 and 3670 ls 1 respectively for the high volume rainfall event of september 1987 fig 5e and 5f the reference case showed a peak flow of 1537 ls 1 in this case as well only bioretention cells were able to reduce peak flow and this reduction was largely due to runoff attenuation brought about by surface infiltration for the first few hours followed by percolation and exfiltration into the natural soil for permeable pavements there was an outflow due to both infiltration excess runoff as well as a delayed release from the storage layer for green roofs the intense sustained rainfall allowed only a marginal reduction in csos interestingly peak cso outflow for rain barrels exceeded the reference case possibly because the barrels were filled by persistent steady rainfall before the peak occurred causing the overflow to spill over the previous fraction this alongside the runoff from the impervious fraction for the sustained rainfall as well as flows from the underdrain of the barrels may have caused the peak cso flow rate to even exceed the reference value these results highlight that cso attenuation is limited during high rainfall duration and intensity echoing the conclusions drawn by tao et al 2017 antecedent conditions of soil and composite suds layers also seem to play a significant role in determining the occurrence of csos thereby highlighting the importance of using long term rainfall data for event based analyses 3 2 effectiveness of suds in reducing csos the responses of the four suds to the selected rainfall events section 3 1 also help explain their overall effectiveness in reducing cso volume and frequency for all precipitation data between 1981 and 2016 see fig 6 the figure elucidates that each of the suds technologies with their different dimensions dissimilar working mechanism and unique deployment requirements exhibited contrasting efficiencies in cso reduction the performance also depended on the volume of water direct rainfall runoff or runon routed to the suds bioretention cells deployed in the permeable fractions of the sub catchments received direct rainfall and runoff from the entire impervious fraction of the sub catchments infiltration and et of water from the composite layers as well as the exfiltration of water into natural soil resulted in a notable csos reduction despite a mere 2 spatial coverage of the bioretention cells cso volume reduction exceeded 71 fig 6a further increasing the spatial coverages of the bioretention cells exceeded that of the impervious areas in the sub catchments resulting in a diminishing return of cso volume reduction when spatial coverage was increased to 30 equivalent to roughly 14 ha cso volume reduction increased logarithmically to nearly 99 and the number of annual cso events was reduced to one which can be argued based on fig 5 to have occurred during an intense rainfall event permeable pavements were implemented in the impervious fractions of the sub catchments thereby reducing the surface runoff generation in all rainfall events excluding those of high intensity and long duration fig 5 as such total cso volume reduction was only about 86 even at 100 coverage fig 6b the trend for cso reduction was also somewhat different there was logarithmic growth in cso volume reduction up to a 30 coverage 6 ha followed by a linear increase in which we anticipate that cso events arising from all but highly intense rainfall events were attenuated rain barrels and green roofs both showed incremental improvement in cso reduction with an increase in spatial extents fig 6c and d respectively it is also interesting to note that although green roofs were better able to reduce cso volume rain barrels fared better in reducing cso frequency 41 annual events for green roofs against 39 events for rain barrels at 100 coverage green roofs like bioretention cells offer evapotranspiration and infiltration except that they receive only direct rainfall the evaporation of waters from the roofs may have led to a higher reduction in cso volumes on the other hand rain barrels only offered temporary storage of stored water the delayed release may have led to a higher reduction in cso frequencies and since they did not have et the volume reduction was relatively lower the uncertainty analysis using the range of minimum and maximum parameter values presented in table 3 show that bioretention cells exhibited the highest deviation due to a wide range of design depth configurations available for the soil layer that greatly affects the infiltration and evapotranspiration processes interestingly increasing the height of rain barrels inversely affected the cso volume reduction process the comparison at different rainfall events for large and small tank sizes shown in section s5 show that large tanks fared well during short bursts of intense rainfall and relatively poorly when the rainfall was steady but not intense in fact the times at which the flows from larger tanks exceeded the smaller tanks were not when the rain subsided they occurred during the rainfall this could possibly be because the tank might have been filled when the rainfall occurred as the tanks were emptying gradually when large tanks were more filled than smaller tanks any occurrence of rainfall could have resulted in more storage of water in small tanks than in large tanks and hence more spills for the latter 3 3 effectiveness of implementing suds in ahp identified sub catchments the criteria and sub criteria used in the two ahp cases to calculate the ssi identified nearly 14 of the total area to be either most suitable or suitable for the placement of suds fig 7 a in the first case the hierarchy of the criteria and sub criteria as well as the weights assigned to each of these suggested prioritising interventions geared towards source control in urbanised residential areas fig 7a left however given the relatively homogeneous distribution of residential areas fig 2 other criteria elevation and slope may have taken precedence the identified areas were largely concentrated at higher elevations away from the trunk line fig 2 the average imperviousness was about 37 with a mean runoff coefficient of 0 35 in the second case areas contributing to cso 7 sub catchments in the north west were identified as suitable for suds deployment fig 7a right in addition to the sub catchments in the south that were identified from the previous ahp case the comparison of cso volume reduction from the distributed implementation versus that in ahp identified sub catchments is depicted in fig 7b implementing suds in ahp identified sub catchments without considering the end point cso locations was not effective for bioretention cells and permeable pavements the cso reduction for the two suds techniques were 40 and 36 respectively which is considerably lower than in the distributed case 95 and 71 respectively for rain barrels and green roofs the targeted ahp approach showed only a marginal improvement in cso volume reduction the evolution of outflows from the cso structures for an equivalent spatial coverage for the two ahp and distributed cases fig 8 helps explain the results of fig 7b the location of cso structures played an important role those located downstream of the catchment csos 6 and 7 had the two largest outflows nearly 67 for reference case and thus a greater influence on the occurrence of cso events and consequently in the efforts to reduce them the total reduction in cso volume from distributed implementation was caused by a decrease in the outflows from all seven cso structures for all four suds for the ahp case the reduction was largely from cso structures 1 2 and 6 and hardly had any effect on cso 7 resulting in a lower cso reduction in comparison with the distributed case this effect was not as prominent in the case of rain barrels and green roofs because of the relatively sparse distribution of buildings in the areas contributing to csos 6 and 7 the criteria set in the ahp based on design manuals led to the selection of areas where surface runoff was high however by including the end point criterion in the second ahp study the location and distribution of cso structures were given due emphasis leading to suds deployment in several sub catchments that largely drain to csos 6 and 7 this improved the cso volume reduction for all four suds techniques more so for the rain barrels than for other suds which remarkably showed nearly 39 cso reduction in this case targeted deployment disconnects the flows from rooftops preventing or at least delaying flows draining into the cso structures the analysis also shows that the effect of targeted suds deployment for cso reduction cannot be generalised while targeted deployment favour rain barrels and green roofs it is rather beneficial to have bioretention cells and permeable pavements distributed throughout the catchment in other words the deployment can be based on other benefits for suds for example runoff reduction or improvement in amenity and can still yield significant of cso reduction 3 4 cost effectiveness analysis of suds the result of the cost effectiveness analysis is shown in fig 9 in which the curves for each of the four suds show the npvs of the cost incurred for the cso volume reduced for different spatial extents the npvs of the costs of cso tanks of three different sizes montalto et al 2007 are also provided for comparison as described in section 2 6 at first glance npvs of the suds are considerably lower than those for cso tanks for 25 35 and 40 cso volume reduction for example reducing the cso volume by 40 using green roofs for which the npv is the highest amongst the four suds costs only 25 of that required using a large cso tank other suds cost much lower for this level of cso volume reduction although simplistic in the calculation the high disparity in costs between the cso tanks and suds implies that the latter may be considered a cost effective retrofitting option to attenuate outflows amongst the four suds bioretention cells had the highest total unit cost due to incremental conversion of the pervious areas resulting in higher spatial coverage and considerable investments required for the plants soil sand layer gravel and the excavation works considering that costs required for operation and maintenance were assumed to be proportional to the capital investment bioretention cells also had the highest o m cost nearly three times higher than that of the green roof the second highest in the list however the cso volume reduction for bioretention cells was so high even at low spatial coverage and the difference in performance so large over that of other suds that they emerge as high cost high reward option interestingly the curve for bioretention cells showed a clear diminishing return of cso volume reduction for any investment made above us 15 million this represented the upper limit of the cost required to effectively reduce csos in the studied system the analysis also positioned permeable pavements as a cost effective option they delivered high cso reduction for less than half the land area required for bioretention cells they also required lesser excavation depth to accommodate the soil pavement and storage layers 750 mm deep than bioretention cells 900 mm deep which had a much deeper soil layer table 1 this had direct implications in terms of the costs required for excavation gravel or soil sand as shown in table 2 these results are in line with conclusions of liu et al 2015 and liu et al 2016 but contradict that of chui et al 2016 in which permeable pavements were more cost effective than bioretention cells this is because of the differences in the composite layers and design configurations for example the presence or lack thereof of soil sand layer in permeable pavements and in the unit costs of the components in the two papers for example excavation costs thereby emphasising the significance of an uncertainty analysis which we have shown in fig 9 in shaded colours for each of the four suds techniques at the other extreme green roofs were the least cost effective option because of the high investments required for drainage mat and waterproofing in addition to those required for roof protection the soil layer and the operation and maintenance the low cost effectiveness of green roofs for cso reduction also conforms to the conclusions by montalto et al 2007 liu et al 2015 and chui et al 2016 on the other hand rain barrels had the lowest unit cost of the four suds techniques as there were no expenses for waterproofing the soil sand layer or excavation table 2 due to the low capital investment the o m cost was also quite low thus rain barrels despite having the lowest cso attenuation for distributed case were effective for the investments required the cost effectiveness analysis thus facilitated a direct comparison of the four suds techniques which in turn allowed for a new perspective in addition to the technical analysis of cso volume and frequency reduction as observed in the case of rain barrels this corroborates the need for an integrated technical economic assessment for a comprehensive assessment of suds in reducing csos 4 further discussion although our study has established the effectiveness of different suds techniques in reducing csos we acknowledge that the swmm model might profit from further calibration for example different runoff coefficients for different types of surface covers for a better approximation of the peak flows that could in turn yield a more accurate representation of cso events as the measured observed inflows at wwtp were computed indirectly from water level values using manning strickler equation this may also have led to errors in estimating the flows and hence contributed to the relatively low nse values however considering that we are conducting relative assessments of the changes in the cso events due to suds implementation the calibrated model serves as a reasonable baseline for benchmarking the suds scenarios as the flow dynamics are well replicated by the model this is especially relevant since our model comprises various complex hydrological and hydraulic processes the presented simple sensitivity analysis table 3 showed consistent results over the different suds considered in this study the influence of the model parameters that characterise the suds i e the composite layers of the four suds could however warrant further sensitivity analysis the use of threshold criteria of 180 l s 1 to define a cso event is also simplistic as cso structures typically detain excess water before discharge into the receiving water body incorporating this feature of cso structures into the study could result in a more accurate estimation of cso volume and frequency 5 conclusion our study to investigate the performance of suds techniques in reducing csos using a 35 year long rainfall data allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the suds performance for rainfall events of different key characteristics we also investigated if targeting selected few sub catchments for suds implementation was more effective than distributing them uniformly all over the study site finally to determine the cost effectiveness of the suds we used the npv of the life cycle cost to compare the performance of the suds techniques against cso tanks of different sizes all four suds techniques showed considerable reduction in csos although this largely depended upon underlying mechanism and deployment specifically we found that 1 performance under different rainfall events could also be considered robust especially for bioretention cells which significantly attenuated csos including those originating from high intensity and high duration rainfall events other suds techniques showed limited cso reduction during high intensity rainfall events 2 location and distribution of cso structures were crucial in regulating cso outflows for rain barrels and green roofs but the criteria from current design guidelines used in our ahp analysis were valid and significant but were poor guidance for reducing csos 3 cost effectiveness analysis showed that bioretention cells may have the highest return of investment amongst the four suds despite their high unit cost at the other extreme green roofs emerged as the least cost effective option the cost effectiveness analysis also showed a rather high return of investment for rain barrels that could yield a significant cso volume reduction with strategic placement at a considerably low cost nevertheless this study has shown that the potential of suds in controlling csos is undoubtedly significant findings support yet another benefit of such multi functional decentralised measures in integrated urban drainage management and deserve more attention in future research and

17208,biodegradation of dissolved organic matter dom plays a key role in regulating both production of greenhouse gases and accumulation and stabilisation of soil organic matter som however the mechanisms by which natural vegetation restoration affects the extent rate and temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation are poorly understood elucidating these mechanisms is important for som management especially in light of future climate warming scenarios in this study a laboratory dom solution incubation experiment was conducted to comprehensively investigate the effects of temperature

introduction although dissolved organic matter dom is a minor fraction of total organic matter in soils 0 25 it is the most mobile and actively cycling organic matter additionally it plays a key role in carbon storage and cycling provides plant available nutrients and serves as an energy source for microorganisms kalbitz et al 2000 marschner and kalbitz 2003 mcdowell et al 2006 moreover dom biodegradation significantly affects the soil organic matter som dynamics in soils further it regulates the production of greenhouse gases i e co2 ch4 and n2o by providing electrons and reducing the soil o2 content required for methanogenesis and denitrification lu et al 2000 mcdowell et al 2006 finally it helps indicate processes that control som accumulation and stabilisation kaiser and kalbitz 2012 therefore understanding the dynamics of dom biodegradation is important for som management and global climate change mitigation natural vegetation restoration without anthropic interference is considered as an efficient measure for recovering both soil fertility and ecosystems with degraded soils prach and walker 2011 re vegetation significantly affects the dom dynamics by altering the

succession rate of fungi has been shown to be significantly higher than that of bacteria in the ziwuling forest region of loess plateau china further the relative abundances of microbial genes responsible for c and n cycling have been shown to decrease and increase with successional stages respectively wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 however the effects of natural vegetation restoration on dom biodegradation are poorly understood further the mechanisms underlying dom biodegradability are largely unknown previous studies have concluded that microbial decomposition of soil organic matter and enzyme activities associated with soil c n and p cycling increased with increasing temperature a bear et al 2014 german et al 2012 min et al 2019 nazaries et al 2015 pang et al 2015 ylla et al 2012 reported that labile organic matter om was rapidly cycled irrespective of the temperature while microbial degradation of recalcitrant substances increased with increasing temperatures recalcitrant organic carbon oc fractions comprise more biochemically complex compounds than labile oc fractions therefore the decomposition of recalcitrant substrates requires greater activation energy von lützow and kögel knabner 2009 the carbon quality temperature hypothesis states that temperature sensitivity increases with the increasing biochemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter davidson et al 2006 specifically the arrhenius equation dictates high temperature sensitivities for oc decomposition reactions occurring at high activation energies conant et al 2011 mao and li 2018 concluded that the carbon quality temperature hypothesis is applicable to doc biodegradation further doc quality and ph are powerful predictors of the temperature sensitivity of biodegradable doc in

soil ph and microbial properties i e gram negative bacterial plfa fungal plfa and fungi to bacteria ratio liu et al 2017a ma et al 2019 wang et al 2018 additionally the carbon quality temperature hypothesis is applicable to n mineralisation because its activation energy is strongly correlated with substrate quality miller and geisseler 2018 schutt et al 2014 previous studies have reported that the temperature sensitivity of n mineralisation is affected by soil total nitrogen soil c to n ratio and soil ph liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017b miller and geisseler 2018 although several studies have focused on mechanisms regulating the temperature sensitivity of som decomposition key factors regulating the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation are largely unknown further the mechanism by which natural vegetation restoration affects the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation is poorly understood this study selected vegetation converted from adjacent farmlands with ages of 30 60 100 130 and 160 years this long term and well dated vegetation restoration chronosequence allowed comprehensive investigation of mechanisms by which natural vegetation restoration and temperature regulated dom biodegradation in the ziwuling forest region of the loess plateau china the dom composition was investigated using three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy which is a reagent free rapid sensitive and selective technique for fingerprinting organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems chen et al 2003 this study aimed to elucidate the effects of natural vegetation restoration and temperature on dom biodegradation further the key factors driving dom biodegradability were identified finally the roles of substance quality and microbial properties in regulating the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation were elucidated we hypothesised that 1 dom biodegradation significantly decreases after farmland abandonment further variations in the biodegradation of doc don and dissolved organic p dop could be attributed to mineralogical differences and different driving forces 2 an increase in temperature significantly promotes dom biodegradation by enhancing the decomposition of chemically recalcitrant substances 3 natural vegetation restoration significantly decreases the q10 of dom biodegradation especially at the forest stage this could be attributed to increased labile organic matter in dom solutions and decreased q10 of enzyme activities resulting from altered microbial communities 2 methods 2 1 study

forest farm is located in the hinterland of the ziwuling forest region of the chinese loess plateau and covers a total area of 23 000 km2 the study area is characterised by mid temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 10 c and an average annual rainfall of 587 mm this area has landforms typical of hilly gully loess topography the soils of this region developed from primary and secondary loess parent materials and are classified as inceptisols usda soil taxonomical system or loesses the soils are evenly distributed above red earth comprising calcareous cinnamon soils at depths ranging from 50 to 130 m the soil ph ranges from 7 92 to 8 31 species rich uniform forests cover this area and the canopy density ranges from 80 to 95 according to previous studies local inhabitants emigrated from the ziwuling forest region due a national conflict 1842 1866 the subsequent secondary succession allowed natural regeneration of forests in the abandoned croplands in particular the complete sequence of natural vegetation succession following farmland abandonment can be observed in the study area chen 1954 investigated vegetation recovery in the ziwuling forest region and reported that p davidiana constituted 70 of the vegetation cover after 100 years zou et al 2002 investigated vegetation succession in this region at three temporal points 1962 1982 and 2000 and concluded that p davidiana forests had been replaced by q liaotungensis forests after 50 years the ages of herbaceous and shrub communities 60 years of succession were verified by consultations with local elders and by assessing land contracts between farmers and the government the ages of forest communities with 60 years of recovery were determined by evaluating tree rings and examining relevant written sources five vegetation succession stages were selected as experimental sites 1 grassland 30 years s30 2 shrubland 60 years s60 3 pioneer forest 100 years s100 4 mingled forest 130 years s130 5 climax forest 160 years s160 the dominant plant species for each vegetation succession stage is listed in table s1 notably maize zea mays l was the only crop cultivated in the study area therefore a maize farm with more than 200 years of cultivation history was selected as the reference 0 year the aboveground biomasses of crops were harvested annually further chemical fertilisers were applied annually although the rate of application varied across the years study sites indicated similar elevations gradients and slopes and had been previously farmed in similar manners zhong et al 2018 the detailed geographical and vegetation characteristics of the study sites are presented in table s1 additionally the soil chemical properties are listed in table s2 in this study four sites each were established at distances ranging from 0 3 to 1 km for the restoration stages in august 2017 further a plot 20 20 m was established at each site soil samples were collected from the top 20 cm using a stainless steel corer diameter 5 cm after removing the litter horizons all sampling points were free of lichens biological crusts and any other vegetation within a radius of 0 75 m twenty soil cores were randomly collected along an s shaped pattern from each plot a total of 24 samples 6 sites 4 replicate plots per site were collected all samples were sieved through a 2 mm screen to remove roots and other debris one subsample was stored at 4 c for subsequent use in the incubation experiment and another subsample was air dried for physicochemical analysis 2 2 preparation of dom solutions

surface area for the establishment of biofilms kalbitz et al 2003b these solutions were incubated in the dark at 4 20 and 35 c for a duration of 60 days temperature is known to stimulate microbial activity within the physiological range of 0 35 c paul and clark 1996 the solutions were gently shaken by hand for 2 min daily to mix the samples further the incubation bottles were opened daily to aerate the dom solutions subsamples were collected after 0 1 3 7 14 22 30 and 60 days each subsample was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane to remove both particulate matter and microorganisms a total of 528 subsamples were collected and frozen prior to further laboratory analysis the unfiltered subsamples were utilised for enzyme activity analysis 2 4 sample analysis the doc

bran luebbe germany the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus srp was determined using the phospho molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 the don and dop were calculated as tdn nh4 no3 and tdp srp respectively if the don or dop is less than 20 of dissolved inorganic n or srp respectively then the measurement errors might have negative influence on the precision of calculated results in this study don or dop were at least at the same order of magnitude compared to dissolved inorganic n or srp respectively conforming that the calculation process of don and dop was valid analytical methods for determining other soil chemical properties and microbial parameters have been described in the materials and methods section of the supplementary material the eem spectrograms of the subsamples were obtained using an ls 55 fluorescence spectrometer perkinelmer usa the slits for both excitation and emission were 5 nm with a scanning speed of 1200 nm min 1 the eems were recorded at 2 nm intervals for excitation wavelengths 200 495 nm and at 5 nm intervals for emission wavelengths 250 500 nm the wavelength dependent intensity of the light source and the light sensitivity of the detector were corrected before conducting the measurements correction factors supplied by the manufacturer were utilised to correct the excitation and emission intensities for instrument specific biases the unfiltered subsamples were prepared for enzyme analysis specifically the activities of β glucosidase n acetyl β glucosaminidase and alkaline phosphatase were measured using standard fluorimetric techniques described by deforest 2009 briefly 50 μl 200 μm substrate of the fluorimetric substrate solution and 150 μl of the subsample were mixed in a microplate and incubated for 2 h at the incubation temperature of the dom solutions subsequently 10 μl of 1 0 m naoh was added to stop the reaction fluorescence was measured using a microplate fluorimeter molecular devices spectramax m2

1 2 5 parallel factor parafac analysis each eem was corrected for inner filtering effects by multiplying with a correction matrix calculated for each wavelength pair from the sample absorbances in this regard the assumed excitation ex and emission em pathlengths were 0 5 cm in a 1 cm cuvette ohno 2002 data from the same vegetation communities were combined to avoid the admixing of various sources or environmental samples the eem spectrogram data were combined into six 3 dimensional arrays 88 samples 51 excitations 41 emissions the raman and rayleigh scatter effects were removed from the data according to liu et al 2019 in order to identify the number of components in the model and to prove the validity of these components four approaches including residual analysis examine the spectral properties of each component split half analysis and random initialization was used figure s2 presents the fluorescent components and the proportional distributions of soil dom components the

dop biodegradation after the 60 day incubation period and the proportion of labile dop p 0 05 fig s4 table s5 specifically farmland abandonment decreased the biodegradation rates of both labile and stable dops table s5 soluble reactive p srp concentration in the dom solution was low and remained relatively stable during the incubation period further no significant differences in srp

temperature after the 60 day incubation period fig 1 however s160 indicated the highest doc biodegradation at 20 c fig 1b the biodegradation rate constant of labile doc pool k1 during 30 to 130 years of vegetation restoration was lowest at 35 c while highest biodegradation rate constant of stable doc pool k2 during the first 100 years of vegetation restoration was observed at 35 c fig 2 in contrast to the farmland natural restoration significantly increased the q10 of the doc biodegradation rate between days 1 and 7 fig 3 a further the q10 was the highest at s130 followed by s100 s60 and s30 and the lowest at s160 elevated temperatures significantly promoted don biodegradation after the 60 day incubation period fig s3 however the q10 values of don biodegradation rates at s30 s60 s100 and s130 were significantly lower than those of doc biodegradation rates fig 3b additionally no significant differences in the q10 values of the don biodegradation rates were observed among the different vegetation restoration stages temperature exerted a negligible effect on the no3 dynamics during the incubation period p 0 05 however nh4 concentrations in the dom solutions were the lowest at 20 c fig s3 dop biodegradation significantly increased with increasing temperature after the 60 day incubation period fig s4 in contrast to the farmland vegetation restoration significantly increased the q10 of the dop biodegradation rate between days 1 and 7 further the q10 was the highest at s100 and s130 followed by s30 and s60 and the lowest at s160 fig 3c the srp concentrations in the dom solutions were the lowest at 4 c fig s4 3 3 changes in dom composition during incubation natural vegetation restoration significantly affected the initial dom composition and its dynamics during the incubation period p 0 05 fig 4 the initial concentrations of c1 c2 and c3 in dom solutions from s130 and of c4 in dom solutions from s30 and s130 were significantly higher than those from

temperature on dom composition varied with the different vegetation restoration stages specifically elevated temperatures significantly increased the concentrations of c1 from s0 and s30 and of c2 c3 and c4 from s30 however elevated temperatures significantly decreased the concentrations of c1 and c2 from s160 and of c3 and c4 from s130 and s160 additionally the concentrations of c1 c2 and c4 from s60 and s100 were the lowest at 20 c and the highest at 35 c 3 4 changes in enzyme activities during incubation natural vegetation restoration and temperature significantly affected the enzyme

the highest at s0 and s60 followed by s30 s130 and s160 and the lowest at s100 fig 3e finally the q10 of ap was the highest at s0 followed by s60 and the lowest at s30 s100 s130 and s160 fig 3f 3 5 factors affecting dom biodegradation the backward stepwise regression model indicated that fungal plfa amf and the fungi to bacteria ratio significantly affected doc biodegradation at 4 c while c3 and c4 exerted significant effects at 20 and 35 c table 3 bg activity significantly affected the doc biodegradation rate at 4 and 20 c table 2 microbial biomass carbon mbc affected both labile and stable doc biodegradation rates at 4 c table 3 further the fungi to bacteria ratio affected the labile doc biodegradation rate at 4 c both labile and stable doc biodegradation rates were affected by fungal plfa at 20 c additionally microbial biomass phosphorus mbp and amf positively affected the labile at 30 c and stable doc biodegradation rates respectively the backward stepwise regression model also indicated that c1 c4 gram positive and gram negative bacterial plfa amf and the fungi to bacteria ratio significantly affected don biodegradation table 3 further bg nag ap and c1 significantly affected the don biodegradation rate during incubation table 2 additionally c3 concentrations in the dom solutions affected the don biodegradation rate only at 4 c table 3 notably c3 c4 gram positive and gram negative bacterial plfa mbp and the fungi to bacteria ratio significantly affected dop biodegradation table 3 further nag ap and c1 significantly affected the dop biodegradation rate during incubation table 2 factors affecting dop biodegradation shifted from c2 gram negative bacterial plfa mbp and the fungi to bacteria ratio at 4 c to mbp at 20 c and microbial biomass nitrogen mbn at 35 c table 3 3 6 factors affecting the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation the sem 1 explained 60 24 and 67 of the variance in the q10 values of the doc biodegradation rate bg activity and ap activity respectively fig 6 the concentrations of c1 and c4 and the q10 of bg and ap activities exerted direct negative effects on the q10 of the doc biodegradation rate while amf exerted a direct positive effect notably the q10 values of bg and ap activities were determined by mbc mbn mbp and fungal plfa further mbn exerted a significant negative effect on the q10 of bg and ap activities amf and fungal plfa the sem 2 explained 43 70 and 53 of the variance in the q10 values of the don biodegradation rate nag activity and ap activity respectively fig s5a the q10 of nag and ap activities exerted direct positive effects on the q10 of the don biodegradation rate further amf and mbp exerted significant negative effects on the q10 of nag additionally mbc exerted direct effects on amf mbp and the q10 of nag and ap activities the sem 3 explained 47 70 and 83 of the variance in the q10 of the dop biodegradation rate ap activity and nag activity respectively fig s5b the q10 of nag and ap activities exerted direct negative effects on the q10 of the dop biodegradation rate while c4 concentration exerted a direct positive effect the q10 of ap activity was negatively affected by fungal plfa and mbn fungal plfa exerted direct negative effects on the q10 of nag and ap activities and were directly and positively affected by mbc and mbn 4 discussion 4 1 effects of natural vegetation restoration on dom biodegradation previous studies conducted in the ziwuling forest region indicated that both litter and soil organic carbon decomposition rate decreased during the succession from grasslands to climax forests with the highest rate observed for grasslands deng et al 2016 zhong et al 2018 in this study consistent with our hypothesis 1 doc biodegradation significantly decreased in response to natural vegetation restoration after the 60 day incubation period p 0 05 fig 1 this result is partly supported by a previous study conducted in the loess plateau which concluded that the conversion of sloped croplands to grasslands shrublands and woodlands significantly decreased doc biodegradation liu et al 2019 further it has been reported that arable lands and grasslands in north eastern germany exhibit significantly high degradation of doc in contrast to natural forests which is consistent with our results kalbitz et al 2003a the backward stepwise regression analysis indicated that doc biodegradation and its rate were affected by both dom composition and microbial properties tables 2 and 3 doc biodegradation was positively affected by the initial concentration of high molecular weight and aromatic humic component c3 fungi and the fungi to bacteria ratio after the 60 day incubation period but negatively affected by the initial concentration of low molecular weight humic component c4 amf and mbc this could be attributed to the following 1 c4 is more recalcitrant than c3 because humic acids with high molecular weights are readily degradable kisand et al 2008 2 the succession rate of fungi was significantly higher than that of bacteria in the ziwuling forest region further the relative abundances of c cycle genes decreased with the successional stages wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 3 fungi exhibit a significant capacity for utilising recalcitrant soil organic matter by producing a wide range of extracellular enzymes that decompose recalcitrant structural compounds such as lignocelluloses and humus peay et al 2008 further the fungi to bacteria ratio is significantly correlated with ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling goberna et al 2012 4 although amf generally lack saprotrophic capability they can compete with saprotrophic microbes specific to oc degradation for n and p sources morrison et al 2017 teutscherova et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 this could diminish the microbial doc decomposition activity in n and p deficient soils therefore the increased recalcitrant component of humic materials in dom fig 4 and amf table s6 along with vegetation restoration exerted direct and indirect effects to inhibit doc biodegradation this is important for reducing the loss of bioavailable c in the loess plateau additionally the doc biodegradation rate during incubation was primarily affected by the enzyme activities involved in c n and p cycling soil microbes preferentially use readily available substrates when available n is sufficient while soil microbes decompose som for mining n when n is limiting blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2008 fontaine et al 2003 luo et al 2016 contrarily c2 a protein like material highly related to biodegradable doc played a negligible role in regulating doc biodegradation fellman et al 2008 farmland abandonment significantly decreased don biodegradation p 0 05 fig s3 which supported our hypothesis 1 specifically pioneer forests 100 y and grasslands 30 y indicated significantly lower don biodegradation than shrubs 60 y mingled forests 130 y and climax forests 160 y zhong et al 2018 reported that s100 indicated the highest potential for ammonia and nitrate assimilation further unlike c cycle genes the relative abundances of n cycle genes increased from s30 to s100 the backward stepwise regression analysis indicated that fulvic acid played a key role in regulating don biodegradation and its biodegradation rate van hees et al 2005 notably fulvic acid is an important component of doc which affects the biological availability of organic chemicals additionally don biodegradation was affected by bacteria amf and the fungi to bacteria ratio it has been reported that vegetation restoration resulted in the shift of bacterial communities from slow growing oligotrophic groups gemmatimonadetes and chloroflexi to fast growing copiotrophic groups alpha and betaproteobacteria wang et al 2019 the results of our study indicated that enzyme activities involved in c and p cycling affected don biodegradation which is partly supported by schmidt et al 2011 who reported that don decomposition was driven by the microbial c demand in agreement with ghani et al 2013 no decreases were observed in the concentrations of no3 and nh4 during incubation thus conforming that don was the most microbial preferred source of n consistent with our hypothesis 1 farmland abandonment significantly decreased dop biodegradation p 0 05 fig s4 with the lowest value observed for mingled forests 130 y this could be attributed to the decreased turnover rates of both labile and stable dops after vegetation restoration dop biodegradation was affected by gram positive bacteria mbp and the fungi to bacteria ratio further the dop biodegradation rate was affected by enzyme activities involved in n and p cycling during incubation in contrast to gram negative bacteria gram positive bacteria are known to utilise a higher variety of substrates ranging from easily available to more complex compounds ali et al 2015 müller et al 2016 the results of this study indicated that microbial phosphorus availability and microbial phosphorus assimilation ability played a significant role in regulating dop biodegradation notably n availability significantly increased within the first 130 y of vegetation restoration table s2 consequently n limitation for microbes was relieved while p limitation for microbes increased during the later stages of vegetation restoration ortiz álvarez et al 2018 schmidt et al 2011 zhong et al 2018 4 2 effects of natural vegetation restoration on the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation numerous studies have reported that an increase in temperature increases both microbial decomposition of soil organic matter and enzyme activities related to soil c n and p cycling a bear et al 2014 german et al 2012 liu et al 2017a min et al 2019 nazaries et al 2015 pang et al 2015 in the present study an increase in temperature significantly increased doc biodegradation except at s160 which indicated the highest doc biodegradation at 20 c which supported our hypothesis 2 the backward stepwise regression analysis indicated that doc biodegradation at 4 c was limited by microbial properties such as fungal plfa amf plfa and the fungi to bacteria ratio contrarily doc biodegradation at 20 and 35 c was limited by humic like materials in the dom solutions the low concentrations of c3 and c4 at s160 restricted microbial degradation at high temperatures thus resulting in low doc biodegradation at 35 c the doc biodegradation rate was affected by high molecular weight humic materials at 4 c and low molecular weight humic materials at 20 and 35 c these results are in agreement with those of allison et al 2010 and frey et al 2013 and confirm that increasing temperatures promoted the microbial utilisation efficiency of more recalcitrant humic substrates von lützow and kögel knabner 2009 this could be attributed to the higher activation energy required for the decomposition of recalcitrant substrates notably bg activity which significantly increased with increasing temperature did not limit the doc biodegradation rate at 35 c furthermore the microbial utilisation efficiency of labile carbon indicated by increased gram negative bacterial plfa and mbc was an important factor that limited the doc turnover rate at low temperatures in contrast recalcitrant c substrates e g fulvic acid and aromatic humic like materials and microorganisms responsible for recalcitrant carbon decomposition e g fungi and gram positive bacteria determined the turnover rates of both labile and stable docs with increasing temperature the temperature sensitivity q10 of the doc biodegradation significantly increased over the first 130 years of vegetation restoration but rapidly decreased between 130 y and 160 y which partly supported our hypothesis 3 specifically the value at s160 was as low as that at s0 fig 3 the carbon quality temperature hypothesis states that temperature sensitivity increases with the biochemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter davidson et al 2006 previous studies have concluded that substrate quality i e soil c n ratio soil lignin and fatty acid content and soil ph and microbial properties i e gram negative bacterial plfa fungal plfa fungi to bacteria ratio and actinomycetes to bacteria ratio affect the temperature sensitivity of som decomposition liu et al 2017a ma et al 2019 wang et al 2018 in this study the results of sem 1 highlighted that the temperature sensitivity of doc biodegradation was directly affected by the initial concentrations of c1 and c4 the temperature sensitivity q10 of enzyme activities involved in c and p cycling and amf a previous study concluded that amf increased the decomposition of soil organic carbon in response to elevated co2 levels by stimulating i e priming the saprotrophs in soils cheng et al 2012 further the study concluded that amf microbiome interactions via carbon and phosphorus exchange likely enhanced the mineralisation of organic p zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 therefore the temperature sensitivity of doc biodegradation was affected by factors regulating c cycling i e biochemical recalcitrant substances and q10 of bg and amf and the factors related to p cycling q10 of ap and amf significantly decreased initial concentrations of c1 and c4 from 130 to 160 y as well as decreased plfa of gram negative bacteria fungi and amf from 100 to 160 y contributed to the low temperature sensitivity of doc biodegradation at the climax forest stage as our hypothesis 2 an increase in temperature significantly promoted don biodegradation after the 60 day incubation period fig s3 liu et al 2016 reported a strong correlation between the activation energy of nitrogen mineralisation and the substrate quality index further they highlighted the applicability of the carbon quality temperature hypothesis to n mineralisation in this study concentrations of high molecular weight and aromatic humic materials c3 negatively affected the don biodegradation rate at 4 c but had a negligible effect on don biodegradation rate at 20 and 35 c thus indicating that don biodegradation at 4 c was limited by microbial c degradation and microbial c3 degradation promoted don biodegradation with increasing temperature however the temperature sensitivity q10 of don biodegradation was significantly lower than that of doc biodegradation these results are supported by schutt et al 2014 who concluded that microorganisms prefer to mineralise n rich organic substrates and the temperature sensitivity of n mineralisation is lower than that of c mineralisation additionally natural vegetation restoration exerted a negligible effect on the temperature sensitivity of don biodegradation which was inconsistent with our hypothesis 3 the sem 2 results indicated that the temperature sensitivity of the don biodegradation was directly affected by the temperature sensitivity of enzyme activities involved in n and p cycling further mbc played a vital role in regulating the temperature sensitivity of the don biodegradation it has been reported that the temperature sensitivity of n mineralisation is affected by soil total nitrogen soil c n ratio and soil ph liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017b miller and geisseler 2018 our results indicated that the temperature sensitivity of don biodegradation was likely related to p cycling processes and microbial carbon availability dop biodegradation significantly increased with increasing temperature after the 60 day incubation period fig s4 which was in agreement with our hypothesis 2 however this is in contrast to andry et al 2019 who reported that temperature exerted a negligible effect on the p fixation process in ferralsol due to high soil p sorption capacity factors affecting dop biodegradation shifted from c2 gram negative bacterial plfa mbp and the fungi to bacteria ratio at 4 c to mbp at 20 c and mbn at 35 c therefore it is likely that protein like substrates and microbial phosphorus availability limited dop biodegradation at low temperatures while microbial nitrogen availability influenced dop biodegradation at high temperatures the temperature sensitivity of the dop biodegradation significantly increased within the first 130 years of vegetation restoration rapidly decreased between 130 and 160 y and finally was as low as that at s0 fig 4 which partly supported our hypothesis 3 the sem 3 results indicated that the temperature sensitivity of the dop biodegradation was directly affected by c4 concentrations and the temperature sensitivity of enzyme activities involved in n and p cycling which was directly affected by soil fungi therefore the low temperature sensitivity of the dop biodegradation rate at s160 was affected by the significantly decreased concentrations of c4 and soil fungi 130 160 y and the low temperature sensitivity of nag and ap activities s160 5 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the effects of natural vegetation restoration and temperature on dom biodegradation in the ziwuling forest region of the loess plateau china doc biodegradation significantly decreased in response to natural vegetation restoration further farmland abandonment significantly decreased the biodegradation of don and dop generally an increase in temperature significantly promoted the biodegradation of doc don and dop by enhancing the microbial utilisation efficiencies of recalcitrant humic substrates i e low molecular weight humic materials significantly decreased concentrations of c1 and c4 from 130 to 160 y increased microbial plfa i e gram negative bacteria fungi and amf from 100 to 160 y and low temperature sensitivities of nag and ap activities contributed to the low temperature sensitivities of the doc and dop biodegradation rates at the climax forest stage however natural vegetation restoration exerted a negligible effect on the temperature sensitivity of the don biodegradation rate our results suggest that dom biodegradability and the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation were regulated by interactions between the biodegradation processes of doc don and dop natural vegetation restoration could prevent dom biodegradation thus increasing the bioavailable organic matter in the loess plateau soils specifically pioneer populus davidiana and mingled populus davidiana and quercus liaotungensis forest stages were important for the recovery and accumulation of soil don and dop respectively further the climax forest community quercus liaotungensis played a vital role in reducing doc and dop losses due to reduced temperature sensitivity of biodegradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17208,biodegradation of dissolved organic matter dom plays a key role in regulating both production of greenhouse gases and accumulation and stabilisation of soil organic matter som however the mechanisms by which natural vegetation restoration affects the extent rate and temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation are poorly understood elucidating these mechanisms is important for som management especially in light of future climate warming scenarios in this study a laboratory dom solution incubation experiment was conducted to comprehensively investigate the effects of temperature and natural vegetation restoration spanning a period of 160 y on dom biodegradation in the loess plateau china the results indicated that dissolved organic c doc biodegradation significantly decreased with vegetation restoration after an incubation period of 60 d further biodegradation of dissolved organic n don and dissolved organic p dop significantly decreased after farmland abandonment specifically the lowest values were observed in pioneer populus davidiana and mingled populus davidiana and quercus liaotungensis forests generally an increase in temperature significantly promoted the biodegradation of doc don and dop by enhancing the microbial utilisation efficiencies of recalcitrant humic substrates i e low molecular weight humic materials our results suggest that dom biodegradability and its temperature sensitivity were regulated by dom substrate quality i e recalcitrant humic materials and microbial properties i e gram negative bacterial and fungal plfa enzyme activities additionally our results suggest that climax forest communities quercus liaotungensis played a vital role in reducing doc and dop losses this could be attributed to the low q10 of the doc

introduction although dissolved organic matter dom is a minor fraction of total organic matter in soils 0 25 it is the most mobile and actively cycling organic matter additionally it plays a key role in carbon storage and cycling provides plant available nutrients and serves as an energy source for microorganisms kalbitz et al 2000 marschner and kalbitz 2003 mcdowell et al 2006 moreover dom biodegradation significantly affects the soil organic matter som dynamics in soils further it regulates the production of greenhouse gases i e co2 ch4 and n2o by providing electrons and reducing the soil o2 content required for methanogenesis and denitrification lu et al 2000 mcdowell et al 2006 finally it helps indicate processes that control som accumulation and stabilisation kaiser and kalbitz 2012 therefore understanding the dynamics of dom biodegradation is important for som management and global climate change mitigation natural vegetation restoration without anthropic interference is considered as an efficient measure for recovering both soil fertility and ecosystems with degraded soils prach and walker 2011 re vegetation significantly affects the dom dynamics by altering the input of organic matter and influencing the rates extent and pathways of microbial degradation kalbitz et al 2000 liu et al 2019 specifically dom biodegradation is affected by intrinsic dom characteristics e g chemical structures of dom compounds and soil factors e g nutrient availability microbial community structures and microbial enzyme activities marschner and kalbitz 2003 the conversion of sloped croplands to grasslands shrublands and woodlands has been shown to significantly increase the concentrations of dissolved organic c doc dissolved organic n don and recalcitrant substances e g humic like materials and fulvic acid in dom solutions and decrease doc biodegradation in the loess plateau china huang et al 2015 kalbitz et al 2003a liu et al 2019 moreover the succession rate of fungi has been shown to be significantly higher than that of bacteria in the ziwuling forest region of loess plateau china further the relative abundances of microbial genes responsible for c and n cycling have been shown to decrease and increase with successional stages respectively wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 however the effects of natural vegetation restoration on dom biodegradation are poorly understood further the mechanisms underlying dom biodegradability are largely unknown previous studies have concluded that microbial decomposition of soil organic matter and enzyme activities associated with soil c n and p cycling increased with increasing temperature a bear et al 2014 german et al 2012 min et al 2019 nazaries et al 2015 pang et al 2015 ylla et al 2012 reported that labile organic matter om was rapidly cycled irrespective of the temperature while microbial degradation of recalcitrant substances increased with increasing temperatures recalcitrant organic carbon oc fractions comprise more biochemically complex compounds than labile oc fractions therefore the decomposition of recalcitrant substrates requires greater activation energy von lützow and kögel knabner 2009 the carbon quality temperature hypothesis states that temperature sensitivity increases with the increasing biochemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter davidson et al 2006 specifically the arrhenius equation dictates high temperature sensitivities for oc decomposition reactions occurring at high activation energies conant et al 2011 mao and li 2018 concluded that the carbon quality temperature hypothesis is applicable to doc biodegradation further doc quality and ph are powerful predictors of the temperature sensitivity of biodegradable doc in subtropical rivers it has been reported that the temperature sensitivity of som decomposition is generally affected by substrate quality i e soil c to n ratio soil lignin and fatty acid content and soil ph and microbial properties i e gram negative bacterial plfa fungal plfa and fungi to bacteria ratio liu et al 2017a ma et al 2019 wang et al 2018 additionally the carbon quality temperature hypothesis is applicable to n mineralisation because its activation energy is strongly correlated with substrate quality miller and geisseler 2018 schutt et al 2014 previous studies have reported that the temperature sensitivity of n mineralisation is affected by soil total nitrogen soil c to n ratio and soil ph liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017b miller and geisseler 2018 although several studies have focused on mechanisms regulating the temperature sensitivity of som decomposition key factors regulating the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation are largely unknown further the mechanism by which natural vegetation restoration affects the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation is poorly understood this study selected vegetation converted from adjacent farmlands with ages of 30 60 100 130 and 160 years this long term and well dated vegetation restoration chronosequence allowed comprehensive investigation of mechanisms by which natural vegetation restoration and temperature regulated dom biodegradation in the ziwuling forest region of the loess plateau china the dom composition was investigated using three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy which is a reagent free rapid sensitive and selective technique for fingerprinting organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems chen et al 2003 this study aimed to elucidate the effects of natural vegetation restoration and temperature on dom biodegradation further the key factors driving dom biodegradability were identified finally the roles of substance quality and microbial properties in regulating the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation were elucidated we hypothesised that 1 dom biodegradation significantly decreases after farmland abandonment further variations in the biodegradation of doc don and dissolved organic p dop could be attributed to mineralogical differences and different driving forces 2 an increase in temperature significantly promotes dom biodegradation by enhancing the decomposition of chemically recalcitrant substances 3 natural vegetation restoration significantly decreases the q10 of dom biodegradation especially at the forest stage this could be attributed to increased labile organic matter in dom solutions and decreased q10 of enzyme activities resulting from altered microbial communities 2 methods 2 1 study sites and soil sampling the study sites were established on the lianjiabian forest farm 35 03 36 37 n 108 10 109 18 e 1211 1453 m a s l in heshui county ganshu province china fig s1 the lianjiabian forest farm is located in the hinterland of the ziwuling forest region of the chinese loess plateau and covers a total area of 23 000 km2 the study area is characterised by mid temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 10 c and an average annual rainfall of 587 mm this area has landforms typical of hilly gully loess topography the soils of this region developed from primary and secondary loess parent materials and are classified as inceptisols usda soil taxonomical system or loesses the soils are evenly distributed above red earth comprising calcareous cinnamon soils at depths ranging from 50 to 130 m the soil ph ranges from 7 92 to 8 31 species rich uniform forests cover this area and the canopy density ranges from 80 to 95 according to previous studies local inhabitants emigrated from the ziwuling forest region due a national conflict 1842 1866 the subsequent secondary succession allowed natural regeneration of forests in the abandoned croplands in particular the complete sequence of natural vegetation succession following farmland abandonment can be observed in the study area chen 1954 investigated vegetation recovery in the ziwuling forest region and reported that p davidiana constituted 70 of the vegetation cover after 100 years zou et al 2002 investigated vegetation succession in this region at three temporal points 1962 1982 and 2000 and concluded that p davidiana forests had been replaced by q liaotungensis forests after 50 years the ages of herbaceous and shrub communities 60 years of succession were verified by consultations with local elders and by assessing land contracts between farmers and the government the ages of forest communities with 60 years of recovery were determined by evaluating tree rings and examining

and s30 and the lowest at s160 elevated temperatures significantly promoted don biodegradation after the 60 day incubation period fig s3 however the q10 values of don biodegradation rates at s30 s60 s100 and s130 were significantly lower than those of doc biodegradation rates fig 3b additionally no significant differences in the q10 values of the don biodegradation rates were observed among the different vegetation restoration stages temperature exerted a negligible effect on the no3 dynamics during the incubation period p 0 05 however nh4 concentrations in the dom solutions were the lowest at 20 c fig s3 dop biodegradation significantly increased with increasing temperature after the 60 day incubation period fig s4 in contrast to the farmland vegetation restoration significantly increased the q10 of the dop biodegradation rate between days 1 and 7 further the q10 was the highest at s100 and s130 followed by s30 and s60 and the lowest at s160 fig 3c the srp concentrations in

temperature on dom composition varied with the different vegetation restoration stages specifically elevated temperatures significantly increased the concentrations of c1 from s0 and s30 and of c2 c3 and c4 from s30 however elevated temperatures significantly decreased the concentrations of c1 and c2 from s160 and of c3 and c4 from s130 and s160 additionally the concentrations of c1 c2 and c4 from

factors affecting dom biodegradation the backward stepwise regression model indicated that fungal plfa amf and the fungi to bacteria ratio significantly affected doc biodegradation at 4 c while c3 and c4 exerted significant effects at 20 and 35 c table 3 bg activity significantly affected the doc biodegradation rate at 4 and 20 c table 2 microbial biomass carbon mbc affected both labile and stable doc biodegradation rates at 4 c table 3 further the fungi to bacteria ratio affected the labile doc biodegradation rate at 4 c both labile and stable doc biodegradation rates were affected by fungal

indicated that c1 c4 gram positive and gram negative bacterial plfa amf and the fungi to bacteria ratio significantly affected don biodegradation table 3 further bg nag ap and c1 significantly affected the don biodegradation rate during incubation table 2 additionally c3 concentrations in the dom solutions affected the don biodegradation rate only at 4 c table 3 notably c3 c4 gram positive and gram negative bacterial plfa mbp and the fungi to bacteria ratio significantly affected dop biodegradation table 3 further nag ap and c1 significantly affected the dop biodegradation rate during incubation table 2 factors affecting dop biodegradation shifted from c2 gram negative bacterial plfa mbp and the fungi to bacteria ratio at 4 c to mbp at 20 c and microbial biomass nitrogen mbn at 35 c table 3 3 6 factors affecting the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation the sem 1 explained 60 24 and 67 of the variance in the q10 values of the doc biodegradation rate bg activity and ap activity respectively fig 6 the concentrations of c1 and c4 and the q10 of bg and ap activities exerted direct negative effects on the q10 of the doc biodegradation rate while amf exerted a direct positive effect notably the q10 values of bg and ap activities were determined by mbc mbn mbp and fungal plfa further mbn exerted a significant negative effect on the q10 of bg and ap activities amf and fungal plfa the sem 2 explained 43 70 and 53 of the variance in the q10 values of the don biodegradation rate nag activity and ap activity respectively fig s5a the q10 of nag and ap activities exerted direct positive effects on the q10 of the don biodegradation rate further amf and mbp exerted significant negative effects on the q10 of nag additionally mbc exerted direct effects on amf mbp and the q10 of nag and ap activities the sem 3 explained 47 70 and 83 of the variance in the q10 of the dop biodegradation rate ap activity and nag activity respectively fig s5b the q10 of nag and ap

restoration on dom biodegradation previous studies conducted in the ziwuling forest region indicated that both litter and soil organic carbon decomposition rate decreased during the succession from grasslands to climax forests with the highest rate observed for grasslands deng et al 2016 zhong et al 2018 in this study consistent with our hypothesis 1 doc biodegradation significantly decreased in response to natural vegetation restoration after the 60 day incubation period p 0 05 fig 1 this result is partly supported by a previous study conducted in the loess plateau which concluded that the conversion of sloped croplands to grasslands shrublands and woodlands significantly decreased doc biodegradation liu et al 2019 further it has been reported that arable lands and grasslands in north eastern germany exhibit significantly high degradation of doc in contrast to natural forests which is consistent with our results kalbitz et al 2003a the backward stepwise regression analysis indicated that doc biodegradation and its rate were affected by both dom composition and microbial properties tables 2 and 3 doc biodegradation was positively affected by the initial concentration of high molecular weight and aromatic humic component c3 fungi and the fungi to bacteria ratio after the 60 day incubation period but negatively affected by the initial concentration of low molecular weight humic component c4 amf and mbc this could be attributed to the following 1 c4 is more recalcitrant than c3 because humic acids with high molecular weights are readily degradable kisand et al 2008 2 the succession rate of fungi was significantly higher than that of bacteria in the ziwuling forest region further the relative abundances of c cycle genes decreased with the successional stages wang et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 3 fungi exhibit a significant capacity for utilising recalcitrant soil organic matter by producing a wide range of extracellular enzymes that decompose recalcitrant structural compounds such as lignocelluloses and humus peay et al 2008 further the fungi to bacteria ratio is significantly correlated with ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling goberna et al 2012 4 although amf generally lack saprotrophic capability they can compete with saprotrophic microbes specific to oc degradation for n and p sources morrison et al 2017 teutscherova et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 this could diminish the microbial doc decomposition activity in n and p deficient soils therefore the increased recalcitrant component of humic materials in dom fig 4 and amf table s6 along with vegetation restoration exerted direct and indirect effects to inhibit doc biodegradation this is important for reducing the loss of bioavailable c in the loess plateau additionally the doc biodegradation rate during incubation was primarily affected by the enzyme activities involved in c n and p cycling soil microbes preferentially use readily available substrates when available n is sufficient while soil microbes decompose som for mining n when n is limiting blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2008 fontaine et al 2003 luo et al 2016 contrarily c2 a protein like material highly related to biodegradable doc played a negligible role in regulating doc biodegradation fellman et al 2008 farmland abandonment significantly decreased don biodegradation p 0 05 fig s3 which supported our hypothesis 1 specifically pioneer forests 100 y and grasslands 30 y indicated significantly lower don biodegradation than shrubs 60 y mingled forests 130 y and climax forests 160 y zhong et al 2018 reported that s100 indicated the highest potential for ammonia and nitrate assimilation further unlike c cycle genes the relative abundances of n cycle genes increased from s30 to s100 the backward stepwise regression analysis indicated that fulvic acid played a key role in regulating don biodegradation and its biodegradation rate van hees et al 2005 notably fulvic acid is an important component of doc which affects the biological availability of organic chemicals additionally don biodegradation was affected by bacteria amf and the fungi to bacteria ratio it has been reported that vegetation restoration resulted in the shift of bacterial communities from slow growing oligotrophic groups gemmatimonadetes and chloroflexi to fast growing copiotrophic groups alpha and betaproteobacteria wang et al 2019 the results of our study indicated that enzyme activities involved in c and p cycling affected don biodegradation which is partly supported by schmidt et al 2011 who reported that don decomposition was driven by the microbial c demand in agreement with ghani et al 2013 no decreases were observed in the concentrations of no3 and nh4 during incubation thus conforming that don was the most microbial preferred source of n consistent with our hypothesis 1 farmland abandonment significantly decreased dop biodegradation p 0 05 fig s4 with the lowest value observed for mingled forests 130 y this could be attributed to the decreased turnover rates of both labile and stable dops after vegetation restoration dop biodegradation was affected by gram positive bacteria mbp and the fungi to bacteria ratio further the dop biodegradation rate was affected by enzyme activities involved in n and p cycling during incubation in contrast to gram negative bacteria gram positive bacteria are known to utilise a higher variety of substrates ranging from easily available to more complex compounds ali et al 2015 müller et al 2016 the results of this study indicated that microbial phosphorus availability and microbial phosphorus assimilation ability played a significant role in regulating dop biodegradation notably n availability significantly increased within the first 130 y of vegetation restoration table s2 consequently n limitation for microbes was relieved while p limitation for microbes increased during the later stages of vegetation restoration ortiz álvarez et al 2018 schmidt et al 2011 zhong et al 2018 4 2 effects of natural vegetation restoration on the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation numerous studies have reported that an increase in temperature increases both microbial decomposition of soil organic matter and enzyme activities related to soil c n and p cycling a bear et al 2014 german et al 2012 liu et al 2017a min et al 2019 nazaries et al 2015 pang et al 2015 in the present study an increase in temperature significantly increased doc biodegradation except at s160 which indicated the highest doc biodegradation at 20 c which supported our hypothesis 2 the backward stepwise regression analysis indicated that doc biodegradation at 4 c was limited by microbial properties such as fungal plfa amf plfa and the fungi to bacteria ratio contrarily doc biodegradation at 20 and 35 c was limited by humic like materials in the dom solutions the low concentrations of c3 and c4 at s160 restricted microbial degradation at high temperatures thus resulting in low doc biodegradation at 35 c the doc biodegradation rate was affected by high molecular weight humic materials at 4 c and low molecular weight humic materials at 20 and 35 c these results are in agreement with those of allison et al 2010 and frey et al 2013 and confirm that increasing temperatures promoted the microbial utilisation efficiency of more recalcitrant humic substrates von lützow and kögel knabner 2009 this could be attributed to the higher activation energy required for the decomposition of recalcitrant substrates notably bg activity which significantly increased with increasing temperature did not limit the doc biodegradation rate at 35 c furthermore the microbial utilisation efficiency of labile carbon indicated by increased gram negative bacterial plfa and mbc was an important factor that limited the doc turnover rate at low temperatures in contrast recalcitrant c substrates e g fulvic acid and aromatic humic like materials and microorganisms responsible for recalcitrant carbon decomposition e g fungi and gram positive bacteria determined the turnover rates of both labile and stable docs with increasing temperature the temperature sensitivity q10 of the doc biodegradation significantly increased over the first 130 years of vegetation restoration but rapidly decreased between 130 y and 160 y which partly supported our hypothesis 3 specifically the value at s160 was as low as that at s0 fig 3 the carbon quality temperature hypothesis states that temperature sensitivity increases with the biochemical recalcitrance of soil organic matter davidson et al 2006 previous studies have concluded that substrate quality i e soil c n ratio soil lignin and fatty acid content and soil ph and microbial properties i e gram negative bacterial plfa fungal plfa fungi to bacteria ratio and actinomycetes to bacteria ratio affect the temperature sensitivity of som decomposition liu et al 2017a ma et al 2019 wang et al 2018 in this study the results of sem 1 highlighted that the temperature sensitivity of doc biodegradation was directly affected by the initial concentrations of c1 and c4 the temperature sensitivity q10 of enzyme activities involved in c and p cycling and amf a previous study concluded that amf increased the decomposition of soil organic carbon in response to elevated co2 levels by stimulating i e priming the saprotrophs in soils cheng et al 2012 further the study concluded that amf microbiome interactions via carbon and phosphorus exchange likely enhanced the mineralisation of organic p zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 therefore the temperature sensitivity of doc biodegradation was affected by factors regulating c cycling i e biochemical recalcitrant substances and q10 of bg and amf and the factors related to p cycling q10 of ap and amf significantly decreased initial concentrations of c1 and c4 from 130 to 160 y as well as decreased plfa of gram negative bacteria fungi and amf from 100 to 160 y contributed to the low temperature sensitivity of doc biodegradation at the climax forest stage as our hypothesis 2 an increase in temperature significantly promoted don biodegradation after the 60 day incubation period fig s3 liu et al 2016 reported a strong correlation between the activation energy of nitrogen mineralisation and the substrate quality index further they highlighted the applicability of the carbon quality temperature hypothesis to n mineralisation in this study concentrations of high molecular weight and aromatic humic materials c3 negatively affected the don biodegradation rate at 4 c but had a negligible effect on don biodegradation rate at 20 and 35 c thus indicating that don biodegradation at 4 c was limited by microbial c degradation and microbial c3 degradation promoted don biodegradation with increasing temperature however the temperature sensitivity q10 of don biodegradation was significantly lower than that of doc biodegradation these results are supported by schutt et al 2014 who concluded that microorganisms prefer to mineralise n rich organic substrates and the temperature sensitivity of n mineralisation is lower than that of c mineralisation additionally natural vegetation restoration exerted a negligible effect on the temperature sensitivity of don biodegradation which was inconsistent with our hypothesis 3 the sem 2 results indicated that the temperature sensitivity of the don biodegradation was directly affected by the temperature sensitivity of enzyme activities involved in n and p cycling further mbc played a vital role in regulating the temperature sensitivity of the don biodegradation it has been reported that the temperature sensitivity of n mineralisation is affected by soil total nitrogen soil c n ratio and soil ph liu et al 2016 liu et al 2017b miller and geisseler 2018 our results indicated that the temperature sensitivity of don biodegradation was likely related to p cycling processes and microbial carbon availability dop biodegradation significantly increased with increasing temperature after the 60 day incubation period fig s4 which was in agreement with our hypothesis 2 however this is in contrast to andry et al 2019 who reported that temperature exerted a negligible effect on the p fixation process in ferralsol due to high soil p sorption capacity factors affecting dop biodegradation shifted from c2 gram negative bacterial plfa mbp and the fungi to bacteria ratio at 4 c to mbp at 20 c and mbn at 35 c therefore it is likely that protein like substrates and microbial phosphorus availability limited dop biodegradation at low temperatures while microbial nitrogen availability influenced dop biodegradation at high temperatures the temperature sensitivity of the dop biodegradation significantly increased within the first 130 years of vegetation restoration rapidly decreased between 130 and 160 y and finally was as low as that at s0 fig 4 which partly supported our hypothesis 3 the sem 3 results indicated that the temperature sensitivity of the dop biodegradation was directly affected by c4 concentrations and the temperature sensitivity of enzyme activities involved in n and p cycling which was directly affected by soil fungi therefore the low temperature sensitivity of the dop biodegradation rate at s160 was affected by the significantly decreased concentrations of c4 and soil fungi 130 160 y and the low temperature sensitivity of nag and ap activities s160 5 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the effects of natural vegetation restoration and temperature on dom biodegradation in the ziwuling forest region of the loess plateau china doc biodegradation significantly decreased in response to natural vegetation restoration further farmland abandonment significantly decreased the biodegradation of don and dop generally an increase in temperature significantly promoted the biodegradation of doc don and dop by enhancing the microbial utilisation efficiencies of recalcitrant humic substrates i e low molecular weight humic materials significantly decreased concentrations of c1 and c4 from 130 to 160 y increased microbial plfa i e gram negative bacteria fungi and amf from 100 to 160 y and low temperature sensitivities of nag and ap activities contributed to the low temperature sensitivities of the doc and dop biodegradation rates at the climax forest stage however natural vegetation restoration exerted a negligible effect on the temperature sensitivity of the don biodegradation rate our results suggest that dom biodegradability and the temperature sensitivity of dom biodegradation were regulated by interactions between the biodegradation processes of doc don and dop natural vegetation restoration could prevent dom biodegradation thus increasing the bioavailable organic matter in the loess plateau soils specifically pioneer populus davidiana and mingled populus davidiana and quercus liaotungensis forest stages were important for the recovery and accumulation of soil don and dop respectively further the climax forest community quercus liaotungensis played a vital role in reducing doc and dop losses due to reduced temperature sensitivity of biodegradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17209,microplastic pathways in the environment must be better understood to help select appropriate mitigation strategies in this 2 year long field study microplastics were characterized and quantified in urban stormwater runoff and through a bioretention cell a type of low impact development infrastructure concentrations of microparticles ranged from below the detection limit to 704 microparticles l and the dominant morphology found were fibers high rainfall intensity and longer antecedent dry days resulted in larger microparticle concentrations in addition atmospheric deposition was a source of microplastics to urban runoff overall these results demonstrate that urban stormwater runoff is a concentrated source of microplastics whose concentrations depend on specific climate variables the bioretention cell showed an 84 decrease in median microparticle concentration in the 106 5 000 µm range and thus is effective in filtering out microplastics and preventing their spread

pathway for microplastics into aquatic environments carney almroth et al 2018 dris et al 2015 piehl et al 2018 potential sources of plastics in urban stormwater include tire wear road wear plastic litter artificial turf paints building materials footwear pre production pellets and powders industrial waste spills from trash collection and landfill leachate coalition clean baltic 2017 sutton et al 2019 textile fibers may also be found in urban stormwater runoff from synthetic clothing carpets home furnishings outdoor items and lint from clothing dryers sutton et al 2019 generally urban stormwater runoff receives little to no intentional treatment before discharging usepa 1999 when it is treated it is usually as part of a combined sewer system during a large rain event it may still go untreated due to overflow usepa 1999 it is therefore expected that stormwater will be another important pathway for microplastics into receiving aquatic systems in addition to treated wastewater to date four publications reporting on studies in the us san francisco bay area mexico germany and sweden have characterized microplastics in urban stormwater runoff i e directly from street runoff or at a stormwater catchment collection point prior to discharge eisentraut et al 2018 gilbreath et al 2019 järlskog et al 2020 piñon colin et al 2020 of these the highest reported concentration was found in mexico with median concentrations ranging from 66 to 191 particles l piñon colin et al 2020 compared to relatively lower concentrations of 0 4 3 2 particles l gilbreath et al 2019 in san francisco and 1 2 particles l in sweden järlskog et al 2020 microplastics measured in the german study eisentraut et al 2018 were reported by weight supporting information si table s1 other studies have measured urban stormwater microplastic concentrations by sampling slightly downstream of storm drains in small tributaries such as one study sutton et al 2019 in san francisco bay with 1 3 to 30 microparticles l or in other urban source streams with concentrations of 0 017 0 3 items l dikareva and simon 2019 0 4 17 4 particles l hitchcock 2020 and 15 4 particles l grbić et al 2020 from catchment sizes ranging from 59 to 89 353 ha others still have reported average concentrations ranges of 0 49 22 9 microplastics l liu et al 2019a 5 4 10 microparticles l coalition clean baltic 2017 and 270 microplastics l olesen et al 2019 in stormwater receiving ponds one study noted that their stormwater results are several orders of magnitude higher than microplastic concentrations in treated wastewater effluents 0 063 microparticles l that discharged to the san francisco bay sutton et al 2019 it is difficult to directly compare microplastic concentrations due to differences in sample collection lab processing size fractions analyzed counting and polymer identification methods between studies sutton et al 2019 however these high concentrations suggest that urban stormwater runoff is a significant pathway for microplastics in the environment bioretention cells have been suggested to be a preventative measure for microplastics in urban areas gilbreath et al 2019 bioretention cells are a type of low impact development system consisting of depressions filled with engineered porous media covered with mulch and vegetation roy poirier et al 2010 they are used to mitigate flooding by allowing runoff to collect on cell surfaces and permeate through underlying media roy poirier et al 2010 while their efficiency at decreasing concentrations of dissolved contaminants is variable spraakman et al 2020 they are effective in retaining total suspended solids tss through physical filtration lefevre et al 2015 li and davis 2008 we therefore hypothesize that microplastics as a type of suspended particle would be effectively removed from stormwater by filtration through bioretention cells one publication to date did a brief study of microplastic removal using a bioretention cell and reported microplastic reductions larger than 80 from three sampled storm events gilbreath et al 2019 pollutant removal for low impact development technologies specifically bioretention cells is highly variable depending on site characteristics design and implementation as well as climate brown and hunt 2012 roy poirier et al 2010 thus to fully characterize the variability in removal performance multi year monitoring following system establishment is required roy poirier et al 2010 spraakman et al 2020 the objectives of this study were to quantify and characterize microplastics in urban stormwater runoff and to give an in depth evaluation of a bioretention cell for its efficiency to filter out microplastics using a multi year dataset to support statistical analysis this study also correlates climatic variables with microplastic concentrations in non diluted source urban stormwater runoff and suggests a novel relationship between the behavior of microplastics and tss 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site was located at the toronto and region conservation authority trca kortright center in vaughan ontario canada described in details elsewhere spraakman et al 2020 and in section s2 stormwater samples were collected from the inlet and outlet of a bioretention cell receiving stormwater runoff from an adjacent parking lot with a 265 m2 drainage area fig s1 and consisting of non permeable composite brick pavers of recycled tire derived rubber eco flex churchill this parking lot provides public parking for nearby hiking trails a visitor center and event space effluent from the bioretention cell drains into a monitoring hut containing sampling equipment 2 2 sample collection samples were collected during the summer and fall of 2018 and 2019 a total of 19 runoff events were sampled resulting in 17 inlet and 14 outlet samples of which there were 12 inlet outlet pairs section s3 automated sampling was performed using two 6712 full size portable samplers teledyne isco lincoln usa at the bioretention cell inlet and outlet each autosampler contained twenty four polypropylene 1 l sample collection bottles the autosampler inlet was fed through plastic tubing connected to a low flow stainless steel strainer from avensys toronto canada with 10 mm openings the strainer drew stormwater runoff from an aluminum pan at the bioretention cell inlet when stormwater pooled in this pan and there were more than 4 cm of runoff passing through the flume at any point during a rainfall event the isco autosampler was activated water samples were combined by hand in a 10 l low density polyethylene ldpe nalgene bottle to make flow weighted composite samples and were transported to campus in high density polyethylene hdpe 2 l collection bottles from fisher scientific whitby canada samples ranged in volume from 0 5 to 2 l depending on the amount of runoff or effluent generated by the rain event 2 3 sample preparation the water samples were sieved in the lab to a threshold size fraction of 106 μm using a stainless steel sieve obtained from fisher scientific isopropyl alcohol purity 68 0 72 0 fisher scientific was added to each sample on site at a concentration of 10 by volume to reduce organic growth using stainless steel sieves the samples were then sieved to four size fractions 106 300 μm 300 500 μm 500 μm 1 mm and 1 mm the 106 300 μm and 300 500 μm size fractions were subjected to a density separation using a filtered 1 4 g cm3 anhydrous calcium chloride solution cacl2 fisher scientific for a minimum of 24 h 2 4 particle quantification plastic particles were visually identified using an sm 1b binocular zoom stereo microscope with 80 magnification from amscope irvine usa particles were categorized based on morphology fiber fragment film foam rubbery fragment sphere or pellet see fig s2 and color within each of the above described four size fractions the distinction between anthropogenic versus organic particles was based on visual characteristics and feel adapted from previous studies greaves and saville 1995 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 meri 2015 2015 noren 2007 all colored particles that matched anthropogenic descriptions were identified as suspected anthropogenic microparticles and microfibers all transparent colored fibers were tested for texture and identified conservatively the first ten suspected anthropogenic microparticles in each morphology and color category within each size fraction were collected on double sided tape for polymer identification collected anthropogenic microparticles and microfibers from one inlet and one outlet sample were photographed using a 5mp usb digital microscope camera from omax ojeong gu south korea section s3 and measured using toupview software from touptek photonics hangzhou china actual measurements were compared to the size fractions in which the measured particles were found 2 5 polymer identification section s4 outlines microplastic and related definitions used in this paper of the collected anthropogenic microparticles and microfibers from stormwater samples 10 per sample were randomly selected for polymer identification within each morphology and color category following two previously published subsampling methods grbić et al 2020 huntington et al 2020 this led to analyzing 482 particles i e 10 5 of total collected particles spectroscopy results are reported as percentages and were not used to correct anthropogenic microparticle concentrations used in statistical analysis plated anthropogenic microparticles and microfibers from stormwater samples and field blanks were analyzed for polymer identification with two horiba xplora plus confocal raman microscopes with lab spec6 software v 6 6 1 11 a µftir spectrometer was used to analyze all suspected black rubbery particles as they burned or did not produce interpretable spectra on the raman spectrometer section s5 prior to spectral matching baseline corrections were applied to spectra as needed raman spectra were compared to a number of commercial libraries section s5 as well as the slopp and slopp e libraries created for microplastics in environmental samples munno et al 2020 in each case the top identified material based on hit quality was selected when a spectrum matched clearly with a polymer type we report the plastic type sometimes spectra have band overlay from dyes and fillers for these samples we created our own particle identification categories anthropogenic microparticles categorized as anthropogenic synthetic were plasticizers e g fm20 pvc impact modifier anthropogenic cellulosic particles identified a dye on cellulose or on cellulose acetate anthropogenic unknown particles were identified as dyes e g indigo carmine with no added spectral information about material type munno et al 2020 co polymers were defined as microplastics composed of two or more plastic types unknown particles consisted of those where we were unable to produce a clear raman spectrum within the maximum analysis time of 20 min additionally unknown burn was a separate category for particles that burned at low raman laser settings i e 785 nm laser with a filter of 0 1 10 particles that burn quickly at such low laser settings are potentially natural based confirmed natural based categories included cellulose and cellulose acetate as well as other natural compounds e g iron oxide although cellulose acetate is a type of microplastic we conservatively reported it as natural since the spectrum for cellulose is similar to that of cellulose acetate 2 6 quality assurance and quality control qa qc an inlet and outlet autosampler field blank was collected for every sampled rain event to quantify the extent of contamination during sampling i e while the 24 1 l bottles of the autosamplers were left open to the atmosphere of the autosampler and during transportation from the field site to the field lab approximately 100 m away these included a blank isco autosample bottle at the inlet and outlet of the bioretention cell where 1 of the 24 1 l bottles was filled in advance of a rain event with reverse osmosis ro water obtained using an ro 1070 water storage tank section s3 this twenty fourth bottle was placed inside the autosampler uncapped during any antecedent dry days after setting up the sampler and for the duration of the rain event field blanks underwent the same sample preparation process as the samples in the lab 100 cotton lab coats and nitrile gloves were worn whenever handling samples glassware and sieves were washed with dish soap and tap water followed by a triple rinse with ro water before and in between uses to reduce procedural contamination two lab blanks were collected with a 1 l volume to approximately match field blank and sample volumes the lab blanks consisted of ro water that followed the same sample preparation process as a regular sample samples were quantified by more than one analyst we took several steps to try to reduce and quantify uncertainty artificial samples consisting of 30 fibers and 25 non fiber microplastic particles total 55 were prepared section s3 seven identical artificial samples were counted by seven analysts the mean and standard deviation was 79 26 n 7 i e a 33 variation among the analysts for all particles together and 53 23 n 7 i e a 43 variation for fibers only section s3 these results indicate a moderate counting reproducibility among different analysts therefore no individual rain event samples were divided among analysts for counting and inlet outlet pairs of samples were counted by the same analyst to measure repeatability one analyst counted three identical artificial samples and observed higher fiber 47 2 n 3 and total particle counts 73 3 n 3 than the spiked values at 30 and 55 respectively but with smaller standard deviations leading to very good repeatability with a corresponding variation at 4 despite efforts to avoid contamination the number of particles counted was larger than the number of particles spiked this led to moderate accuracy with corresponding error at 43 for all particles and poor accuracy 78 error for fibers only finally artificial samples n 3 were used in a spike and recovery test the recovery was 82 5 table s2 2 7 statistical analyses microparticle concentrations at the bioretention inlet and outlet were censored using non parametric survival analysis methods specifically the regression on statistics and kaplan meier methods concentrations below the average field blank concentration were considered below the limit of detection and the relative ranks of data points were used when calculating summary statistics the limit of detection lod for this process was set as the average of the inlet and outlet field blank microparticle concentrations for each size fraction and for all size fractions together and for all microparticles together including microfibers microparticles excluding microfibers and for microfibers only table s3 the shapiro wilk test was used to test data normality the paired generalized wilcoxon test was used to test significance between inlet and outlet concentrations calculations of percent concentration and load reductions and pearson correlation analysis are described in sections s3 and s6 respectively all statistical tests were performed in r with a significance level of 0 05 r development core team 2020 3 results 3 1 qa qc the two lab blanks had concentrations of 15 and 31 microparticles l the field blanks showed similar anthropogenic microparticle concentrations to the bioretention cell outlet samples with an average inlet and outlet field blank concentration of 89 and 85 particles l respectively while no lab blank correction was made on the sample microparticle concentrations the field blank average value at 87 microparticles l was used as the lod in the statistical analyses described above approximately 95 of the field blank microparticles were fibers and the lab blank consisted entirely of fibers 3 2 distribution of microplastics by morphology and color considering all sizes together inlet samples showed a wider distribution of particle morphology than outlet samples fig 1 this difference in diversity between inlet and outlet samples was less prominent in the two largest size fractions but increased in the two smallest size fractions fig s3 in both locations fibers were dominant and rubbery fragments were only found in inlet samples these results suggest that the rubbery fragments likely coming from tire wear and the recycled tire pavement of the drainage area were retained in the bioretention cell both inlet and outlet samples contained a large variety of microparticle colors but in both cases clear microparticles dominated and a lower number of black particles were found in the outlet than in the inlet fig s4 3 3 characterization of polymer types of all the inlet and outlet sample particles analyzed 78 were confirmed anthropogenic including both cellulose based or plastic based that had undergone some chemical treatment i e plastic co polymer anthropogenic synthetic anthropogenic cellulosic anthropogenic unknown fig 2 of these plastic accounted for 28 i e plastic co polymer anthropogenic synthetic cellulose related accounted for 34 i e cellulose and cellulose acetate anthropogenic cellulosic and 36 were still of unknown origin i e unknown anthropogenic unknown unknown burn the rest i e 1 was of natural origin the most frequently detected plastic polymer types observed in the inlet samples were polyester 34 polyurethane 23 and polyethylene 13 the outlet samples had similar polymer type distributions to field blanks for polyester 24 in outlet samples 20 in field blank polyurethane 12 10 and polyethylene 12 10 but they had a larger fraction of acrylic 16 0 and less pvc 4 and 30 than field blanks section s9 no particles were confirmed as plastic in the lab blank in which anthropogenic cellulosic dominated 67 section s9 the top two most frequently detected polymers i e polyester and polyurethane are commonly used in clothing while the third most detected polymer i e polyethylene is commonly used in packaging the majority of analyzed films were plastic 74 many fragments were identified as plastic 42 however some were identified as anthropogenic unknown 21 where the polymer type was masked by the dye signal nearly half of microfibers 41 were identified as cellulose or anthropogenic cellulosic and a small proportion were identified as plastic 20 limited results were obtained for the rubbery particles section s9 likely due to issues with fluorescence and infrared light absorption common for black particles as well as rubber compositions in products like tires that vary by application and can include natural rubbers as well as a host of fillers and property enhancing agents eisentraut et al 2018 käppler et al 2016 wagner et al 2018 natural based microparticles i e cellulose cellulose acetate other natural and unknown burn had similar distributions in both inlet 10 and outlet samples 12 as well as field blanks 12 3 4 effect of climatic variables on microparticle concentrations no climate variables studied were found to have a statistically significant correlation with the total anthropogenic microparticle concentrations the only statistically significant correlation was found between anthropogenic particles excluding fibers and maximum rainfall intensity spearman rho 0 56 p 0 030 section s6 however microparticle concentrations at the bioretention cell inlet appeared to be proportional to the number of antecedent dry days fig 3 low microparticle concentrations were observed with low antecedent dry days while samples collected after longer dry periods had high microplastic concentrations 3 5 bioretention cell efficiency at limiting microplastic contamination sampled rain events ranged from 2 6 to 39 mm of these events 53 were less than the bioretention cell s storage capacity of 15 mm spraakman et al 2020 outflows produced from events below this storage capacity were due to saturated soil from a previous rain event or high rainfall intensities during sample collection suspected anthropogenic microparticle hereinafter referred to as microparticles concentrations were significantly higher at the bioretention cell inlet than at the outlet p value 0 001 overall the mean concentration was 186 173 particles l at the inlet and 31 35 particles l at the outlet for all microparticles including microfibers section s11 microparticle contamination was frequently below detection limits at the outlet for 86 of the samples likewise per size fraction microparticle concentrations were significantly larger at the inlet than the outlet and were the largest for the smallest size fraction the inlet and outlet average concentrations were respectively 34 13 and 4 8 microparticles l for 1 mm 19 6 microparticles l and lod for 500 µm 1 mm 27 9 and 7 12 microparticles l for 300 500 µm and 105 157 and 7 17 microparticles l for 106 300 µm fig s10 the median microparticle percent reduction produced by the bioretention cell was 84 for all particles together including microfibers median microparticle concentrations were reduced by 76 for the 300 500 μm size range and 95 for the other three size fractions given that the bioretention cell had significant volume reduction on average at 93 12 during the monitoring period the microparticle load reductions were high for all sizes together ranging from 92 to 100 censored boxplots with concentration and load reductions for microfibers and microparticles excluding microfibers are presented in figs s11 and s12 the percent concentration reductions for the microparticles excluding microfibers were similar to those reported above for all microparticles together with an overall median microparticle concentration reduction of 89 the lowest percent concentration decrease was 45 for the 300 500 μm size range and very high concentration decreases 89 were obtained for the other three size fractions contrary to what was observed for all microparticles together the concentrations of microparticles excluding microfibers increased with decreasing size fraction in comparison all outlet microfiber concentrations were lod and microfiber concentrations did not increase or decrease with size fractions the probability distribution plot of all anthropogenic microparticles fig 4 showed that 35 and 90 of observations were lod for inlet and outlet samples respectively the hypothesis that microparticles are well removed by bioretention is supported by our data as there is a 65 chance that they will be found in stormwater influent compared to a 10 chance to be present in the effluent after bioretention filtration for all size fractions although not currently regulated future microplastic concentration targets or ecotoxicological limits can be compared to probability plots to determine the probability of exceedance 4 discussion 4 1 stormwater is a major entry pathway for microplastics in the environment our study showed that urban stormwater runoff can be associated with large concentrations of microparticles ranging up to 704 microparticles l for sizes ranging from 106 µm to 5 mm this work therefore demonstrates that urban stormwater runoff is a major entry pathway for microplastics and microfibers into the environment especially considering the low use of the sampling site i e limited daily vehicles and pedestrians and no commercial traffic even when censored for field blanks table s8 the microparticle concentrations found in this study were higher than those typically observed in stormwater and other freshwater environments table s1 for example in comparison to the three other direct urban stormwater runoff studies with particle count concentrations gilbreath et al 2019 sutton et al 2019 microparticle concentrations in our samples were 58 to 458 times higher than two of these studies gilbreath et al 2019 järlskog et al 2020 however they were similar in concentration to one study where mean concentrations for 5 sites ranged from 88 to 289 particles l exceeding our mean concentration of 186 particles l at some sampling locations piñon colin et al 2020 the kortright center drainage area was a 265 m2 impervious parking lot made of recycled tire rubber pavers whereas the drainage area of the san francisco bay bioretention study was a 4080 m2 impervious area made of 67 roads 13 buildings and 20 residential gilbreath et al 2019 in comparison the tributary san francisco stormwater study had a variety of land uses at its 12 sampling locations generally with higher proportions of residential and commercial spaces in significantly larger drainage areas compared to our study s drainage area by a factor of at least 2 0 104 sutton et al 2019 like in our study gilbreath et al 2019 sampled stormwater at its source specifically collecting runoff from pavement at ground elevation at the drainage area outlet conversely sutton et al 2019 collected stormwater further from the source in small tributaries using a depth integrated method and at one location a surface water grab sample despite the smaller but similarly highly impervious drainage area the kortright center stormwater runoff had higher microparticle concentrations than reported in gilbreath et al 2019 since we used similar methods to those from gilbreath et al 2019 i e minimum studied particle size autosample collection and visual quantification with raman verification the difference in microparticle concentration is likely explained by differences in climatic factors see next section land use and catchment area material composition as well as from dilution due to larger sample sizes differences in microparticle concentrations could also be explained by differences in sampling location relative to microplastic sources and sampling technique microplastics become more diluted as they move downstream and therefore sampling during rain events in tributaries could lead to more diluted microparticle concentrations than when samples are collected at the immediate outlet of a drainage area e g at street level or stormwater catch basin rubberized pavements are desirable as they recycle a waste material have a higher non slip surface and provide noise abatement like all pavement types they degrade over time from weathering and traffic loadings and can therefore become a source of microplastics likewise all pavements may have undesired or unintended environmental effects to ecosystems and human health such as dna damage and inflammatory effects resulting from inhalation of rubberized pavement particles baensch baltruschat et al 2020 lefevre et al 2016 rubber vulcanizers used in vehicle tire manufacturing known to be toxic to various organisms and a contact allergen for humans can leach from tire dust particles thus further contributing negative impacts on human and ecosystem health lefevre et al 2016 although we were unable to confirm their chemical composition with µftir or raman spectroscopy the rubbery particles found in stormwater in this study confirm the need for control measures to reduce their contamination in the downstream environment 4 2 rainfall intensity and antecedent dry days are climatic variables that influence the microplastic concentration in runoff our results showed that the maximum rainfall intensity was the best statistically significant predictor of anthropogenic microparticle excluding fibers concentration in urban stormwater runoff increasing rainfall intensity may influence how settled microplastics on pavements are dislodged and enter stormwater during a rain event although not statistically significant antecedent dry days also showed a positive trend with microparticle concentration which can be explained by build up of particles during increasing times between rain events we were only able to obtain samples from three events with antecedent dry days greater than 6 days due to variation in the weather however more events with similarly large dry days may lead to a more pronounced correlation similar correlations were observed between antecedent dry days and tss cheema et al 2017 gunawardena et al 2013 and for microparticle abundance and antecedent rainfall depth hitchcock 2020 an increase in microplastic load in urban stormwater runoff was also observed for rain events with increasing precipitation depth piñon colin et al 2020 other impacting factors for microplastic concentrations are land use in the drainage area grbić et al 2020 sutton et al 2019 sampling time during the hydrograph and size of the drainage area as observed for tss concentrations cheema et al 2017 suggesting that an analogy can be made between tss and microplastics therefore existing tss transport models can likely be used as a first approximation to simulate deposition and wash off mechanisms of microplastics in urban areas and predict their transport in stormwater runoff likewise some atmospheric microplastic studies have suggested that climatic factors including rainfall depth may influence microplastic concentrations in runoff allen et al 2019 dris et al 2016 2015 allen et al 2019 found a strong significant correlation between precipitation depths r 0 8 p 0 05 and microplastic count as well as a significant positive correlation r 0 9 p 0 05 between rainfall intensity and microplastic count others studying tss have found weak or no correlations between the first flush of tss concentrations and antecedent dry days deletic 1998 han et al 2006 lee et al 2002 saget et al 1996 rainfall intensity deletic 1998 han et al 2006 saget et al 1996 rainfall depth deletic 1998 saget et al 1996 and rainfall duration deletic 1998 the relationship between climatic factors and microplastic concentrations is important to construct accurate and reliable models these models can be used to explore various scenarios and quantify the impact of input variables such as land use changes and urban growth on microplastic contamination such models are needed to inform policy and support decision making more research should evaluate a wider range of antecedent dry days rainfall intensity and duration on microplastic concentrations in urban stormwater runoff longer inter event time may allow for more build up of particles in the bioretention cell drainage area including both tss and microplastics 4 3 atmospheric deposition is a major source of microfibers in urban stormwater atmospheric deposition appears to be a major pathway for microplastic entry into the environment in this study the field blanks had high concentrations of microparticles sometimes exceeding concentrations in outlet samples whereas the lab blank had lower but non null concentrations of microparticles these data demonstrate that both indoor and outdoor air microplastic contamination represents a major source of microplastics in analyzed urban stormwater therefore actions targeted to reducing air microplastic concentrations may also contribute to decreasing contamination in aquatic environments in both field blanks and bioretention cell samples fibers were the dominant type of microplastic 79 of the total number of particles observed the lab blank in comparison had a lower microparticle concentration and entirely consisted of fibers this dominance of fibers in indoor and outdoor air microplastic contamination matches the few studies to date that quantified atmospheric deposition of microplastics table s19 allen et al 2019 dris et al 2017 2016 2015 liu et al 2019b stanton et al 2019 these microfibers may have come locally from clothing of visitors and staff in the study site area or globally from long range transport of microfibers emitted in other places indeed high concentrations of microfibers were found in isolated and sparsely populated areas allen et al 2019 bergmann et al 2019 huntington et al 2020 fibers identified in the field blanks and outlet samples had similar raman spectroscopy results outlet samples and field blanks were composed of 15 and 16 plastic and 47 and 46 cellulose respectively compared to 24 plastic and 36 cellulose in the inlet samples since similar distributions of microparticle types were found in both field blanks and outlet samples they are likely from the same source of contamination thought to be atmospheric deposition raman results with 0 confirmed plastic in one lab blank supports that other cellulose based contamination came from the lab during sample processing 4 4 bioretention cells are very efficient treatment practices for microplastic contamination the first major result of this study is the demonstration of the high efficiency of bioretention cells for microplastic removal over the two year study period the bioretention cell reduced median microplastic concentrations by 84 and loads by more than 92 this is consistent with the only other existing study that incorporated microplastic data in a bioretention cell located in the san francisco bay area which reports percent concentration reductions of 90 from 2 49 to 0 25 particle l 83 from 0 41 to 0 07 particles l and 95 from 3 15 to 0 17 particles l from three inlet outlet pairs of samples gilbreath et al 2019 as a suspended solid microplastics are likely removed from stormwater within the bioretention cell through physical filtration in comparison to stormwater other aquatic pathways of microplastics into the environment have shown lower mean concentrations likely due to dilution in upstream sources such as wastewater effluent 0 063 particles l sutton et al 2019 0 05 particles l mason et al 2016 freshwater 2 78 103 1 93 105 particles km2 for four major canadian lakes anderson et al 2017 and marine water 0 00246 particles l in north east atlantic ocean lusher et al 2014 it is therefore important to mitigate the spread of microplastics at the stormwater level to prevent entry into downstream water bodies in canada it is recommended that bioretention cell media should consist of 75 90 sand 0 05 mm 2 mm in size 7 22 of silt 0 002 0 05 mm in size and 3 12 clay 0 002 mm for infiltration site specific goals canadian standards association group 2018 porosity is typically set to 0 35 0 4 canadian standards association group 2018 given that its filter media parameters follow these guidelines and that other bioretention cell guidelines list similar recommended media compositions table s7 the kortright bioretention cell is a conventional cell by design and therefore this study s data is applicable to other conventionally designed cells while pore size does not perfectly correlate with porosity pore size distribution data are rare compared to porosity data pore size distribution can increase or decrease over time due to the accumulation of fine particles brown and hunt 2012 the presence of vegetation roots and series of freezing and thawing cycles ding et al 2019 the average field derived porosity for the bioretention cell of this study was determined as 43 across the cell surface area in november 2017 spraakman et al 2020 which is within the range of typical sandy bioretention media high infiltration rates were maintained 4 5 years post construction spraakman et al 2020 in this cell thus confirming the absence of significant clogging in another bioretention cell soil from ajax on approximately 65 km away from the kortright site average pore diameters of 32 44 µm were measured using x ray tomography ding et al 2019 with a minimum sieve pore size of 106 µm all studied microparticles were theoretically larger than a large portion of the bioretention cell pore diameter and should therefore be removed by physical filtration this is consistent with the large concentration reductions and the low outlet microparticle concentrations lod for the 500 µm to 1 mm size fraction and 7 microparticles l observed for all other size fractions in our study microfibers were well removed from stormwater via the bioretention cell as their median concentration dropped from 89 97 microparticles l at the inlet to lod at the outlet for all sizes in comparison microfiber concentration had similar median concentrations in each size fraction i e 23 14 6 9 and 29 microparticles l for size fractions in decreasing order in addition 72 and 89 of particles in an inlet and outlet sample respectively were found to be outside the range of the sieve size fractions for fibers only 74 and 87 of particles were out of the sieve size fractions section s12 these similar concentrations in each size fraction and large proportions of particles out of the sieve size fractions may be due to the long narrow morphology of fibers which allowed them to pass through any sieve depending on their orientation resulting in fibers getting collected on sieves not reflective of their length in one pair of inlet outlet samples particle size measurements showed that fibers had an average diameter of 18 µm and varying lengths ranging from 47 µm to 5 mm in this inlet sample 97 of fibers in the smallest size fraction were larger in length than the upper limit of the size fraction 300 µm these results show that no interpretation of microfiber concentrations and concentration reductions can be made per size fraction when those are obtained from sieving due to the major contribution of fibers in the total microparticle counts overall microparticle concentrations and concentration reductions per size fraction cannot be interpreted either likewise microfibers may be underestimated in concentrations as their small widths may allow them to pass through the smallest sieve of 106 µm during sample processing for microparticles excluding microfibers particles in most size fractions and all sizes largely did not occur in the correct sieved size ranges except for the 106 300 µm fraction where 64 of particles were within the correct size range this size fraction of microparticles excluding microfibers had the largest concentration of the four size fractions of 45 102 microparticles l which can be explained by a larger abundance of increasingly small microparticles in the environment due to particle fragmentation through sun exposure and mechanical stress over time finally another possible factor affecting particle retention is the underdrain slot size in this study the bioretention cell underdrain had a diameter of 10 cm a maximum slot length of 22 mm and a maximum slot width of 3 mm depending on their orientation microplastic particles larger than 3 mm that infiltrated the soil and reached the underdrain may not have been able to enter the underdrain in addition the potential development of biofilm and build up of sediment on the underdrain slots can result in further reduction of the entry point size for microplastics and microfibers to the bioretention cell outlet 5 conclusion this work highlights the role of atmospheric microfiber deposition onto urban surfaces as a key input into stormwater runoff when microparticles are washed off by rain events it showed that urban stormwater can exhibit large concentrations of microparticles including natural and plastic fibers and non fiber particles while this contamination can contribute significant impairment of downstream ecosystems our bioretention cell monitoring results demonstrated that vegetated stormwater infiltration systems can be very efficient in trapping microplastics future work should evaluate the effects of media type and depth on the efficiency of microplastic retention and the contribution of microplastic to bioretention media clogging for both urban stormwater runoff and infiltration systems such as bioretention cells future research should characterize the fate of smaller particle sizes 106 µm and that of chemicals associated with microplastics these chemicals include those incorporated during plastic or cotton manufacturing and those that adsorbed onto plastic or natural particles during their transport in air or stormwater the transport and potential impact of microplastics from bioretention cells to groundwater should also be studied finally this study showed the analogy between the well studied tss and microplastics in both urban runoff and bioretention cells this suggests that existing tss fate models built to predict generation transport and fate in urban stormwater and bioretention cells can be used as a first approximation to estimate microplastics concentration in stormwater and concentration reduction in bioretention cells declaration of competing interest the

17209,microplastic pathways in the environment must be better understood to help select appropriate mitigation strategies in this 2 year long field study microplastics were characterized and quantified in urban stormwater runoff and through a bioretention cell a type of low impact development infrastructure concentrations of microparticles ranged from below the detection limit to 704 microparticles l and the dominant morphology found were fibers high rainfall intensity and longer antecedent dry days resulted in larger microparticle concentrations in addition atmospheric deposition was a source of microplastics to urban runoff overall these results demonstrate that urban stormwater runoff is a concentrated source of microplastics whose concentrations depend on specific climate variables the bioretention cell showed an 84 decrease in median microparticle concentration in the 106 5 000 µm range and thus is effective in filtering out microplastics and preventing their spread to downstream environments altogether these results highlight the large contribution of urban stormwater runoff to microplastic contamination in larger aquatic systems and demonstrate the potential for current infiltration based low impact development practices to limit the spread of microplastic contamination downstream graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioretention microplastic microfiber water quality stormwater 1 introduction microplastics are plastic particles less than 5 mm in size of varying morphologies including fragments films and fibers in the environment suspected anthropogenic microparticles are confirmed as microplastics through methods such as raman or fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy sutton et al 2019 studies have shown that microplastics are ubiquitous in the environment and that there are negative impacts on aquatic and terrestrial organisms baeza et al 2020 foley et al 2018 jin et al 2019 white et al 2018 this has led to concerns about transport through the food chain barboza et al 2018 cox et al 2019 schymanski et al 2018 recent but limited studies have suggested stormwater runoff as a significant entry pathway for microplastics into aquatic environments carney almroth et al 2018 dris et al 2015 piehl et al 2018 potential sources of plastics in urban stormwater include tire wear road wear plastic litter artificial turf paints building materials footwear pre production pellets and powders industrial waste spills from trash collection and landfill leachate coalition clean baltic 2017 sutton et al 2019 textile fibers may also be found in urban stormwater runoff from synthetic clothing carpets home furnishings outdoor items and lint from clothing dryers sutton et al 2019 generally urban stormwater runoff receives little to no intentional treatment before discharging usepa 1999 when it is treated it is usually as part of a combined sewer system during a large rain event it may still go untreated due to overflow usepa 1999 it is therefore expected that stormwater will be another important pathway for microplastics into receiving aquatic systems in addition to treated wastewater to date four publications reporting on studies in the us san francisco bay area mexico germany and sweden have characterized microplastics in urban stormwater runoff i e directly from street runoff or at a stormwater catchment collection point prior to discharge eisentraut et al 2018 gilbreath et al 2019 järlskog et al 2020 piñon colin et al 2020 of these the highest reported concentration was found in mexico with median concentrations ranging from 66 to 191 particles l piñon colin et al 2020 compared to relatively lower concentrations of 0 4 3 2 particles l gilbreath et al 2019 in san francisco and 1 2 particles l in sweden järlskog et al 2020 microplastics measured in the german study eisentraut et al 2018 were reported by weight supporting information si table s1 other studies have measured urban stormwater microplastic concentrations by sampling slightly downstream of storm drains in small tributaries such as one study sutton et al 2019 in san francisco bay with 1 3 to 30 microparticles l or in other urban source streams with concentrations of 0 017 0 3 items l dikareva and simon 2019 0 4 17 4 particles l hitchcock 2020 and 15 4 particles l grbić et al 2020 from catchment sizes ranging from 59 to 89 353 ha others still have reported average concentrations ranges of 0 49 22 9 microplastics l liu et al 2019a 5 4 10 microparticles l coalition clean baltic 2017 and 270 microplastics l olesen et al 2019 in stormwater receiving ponds one study noted that their stormwater results are several orders of magnitude higher than microplastic concentrations in treated wastewater effluents 0 063 microparticles l that discharged to the san francisco bay sutton et al 2019 it is difficult to directly compare microplastic concentrations due to differences in sample collection lab processing size fractions analyzed counting and polymer identification methods between studies sutton et al 2019 however these high concentrations suggest that urban stormwater runoff is a significant pathway for microplastics in the environment bioretention cells have been suggested to be a preventative measure for microplastics in urban areas gilbreath et al 2019 bioretention cells are a type of low impact development system consisting of depressions filled with engineered porous media covered with mulch and vegetation roy poirier et al 2010 they are used to mitigate flooding by allowing runoff to collect on cell surfaces and permeate through underlying media roy poirier et al 2010 while their efficiency at decreasing concentrations of dissolved contaminants is variable spraakman et al 2020 they are effective in retaining total suspended solids tss through physical filtration lefevre et al 2015 li and davis 2008 we therefore hypothesize that microplastics as a type of suspended particle would be effectively removed from stormwater by filtration through bioretention cells one publication to date did a brief study of microplastic removal using a bioretention cell and reported microplastic reductions larger than 80 from three sampled storm events gilbreath et al 2019 pollutant removal for low impact development technologies specifically bioretention cells is highly variable depending on site characteristics design and implementation as well as climate brown and hunt 2012 roy poirier et al 2010 thus to fully characterize the variability in removal performance multi year monitoring following system establishment is required roy poirier et al 2010 spraakman et al 2020 the objectives of this study were to quantify and characterize microplastics in urban stormwater runoff and to give an in depth evaluation of a bioretention cell for its efficiency to filter out microplastics using a multi year dataset to support statistical analysis this study also correlates climatic variables with microplastic concentrations in non diluted source urban stormwater runoff and suggests a novel relationship between the behavior of microplastics and tss 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site was located at the toronto and region conservation authority trca kortright center in vaughan ontario canada described in details elsewhere spraakman et al 2020 and in section s2 stormwater samples were collected from the inlet and outlet of a bioretention cell receiving stormwater runoff from an adjacent parking lot with a 265 m2 drainage area fig s1 and consisting of non permeable composite brick pavers of recycled tire derived rubber eco flex churchill this parking lot provides public parking for nearby hiking trails a visitor center and event space effluent from the bioretention cell drains into a monitoring hut containing sampling equipment 2 2 sample collection samples were collected during the summer and fall of 2018 and 2019 a total of 19 runoff events were sampled resulting in 17 inlet and 14 outlet samples of which there were 12 inlet outlet pairs section s3 automated sampling was performed using two 6712 full size portable samplers teledyne isco lincoln usa at the bioretention cell inlet and outlet each autosampler contained twenty four polypropylene 1 l sample collection bottles the autosampler inlet was fed through plastic tubing connected to a low flow stainless steel strainer from avensys toronto canada with 10 mm openings the strainer drew stormwater runoff from an aluminum pan at the bioretention cell inlet when stormwater pooled in this pan and there were more than 4 cm of runoff passing through the flume at any point during a rainfall event the isco autosampler was activated water samples were combined by hand in a 10 l low density polyethylene ldpe nalgene bottle to make flow weighted composite samples and were transported to campus in high density polyethylene hdpe 2 l collection bottles from fisher scientific whitby canada samples ranged in volume from 0 5 to 2 l depending on the amount of runoff or effluent generated by the rain event 2 3 sample preparation the water samples were sieved in the lab to a threshold size fraction of 106 μm using a stainless steel sieve obtained from fisher scientific isopropyl alcohol purity 68 0 72 0 fisher scientific was added to each sample on site at a concentration of 10 by volume to reduce organic growth using stainless steel sieves the samples were then sieved to four size fractions 106 300 μm 300 500 μm 500 μm 1 mm and 1 mm the 106 300 μm and 300 500 μm size fractions were subjected to a density separation using a filtered 1 4 g cm3 anhydrous calcium chloride solution cacl2 fisher scientific for a minimum of 24 h 2 4 particle quantification plastic particles were visually identified using an sm 1b binocular zoom stereo microscope with 80 magnification from amscope irvine usa particles were categorized based on morphology fiber fragment film foam rubbery fragment sphere or pellet see fig s2 and color within each of the above described four size fractions the distinction between anthropogenic versus organic particles was based on visual characteristics and feel adapted from previous studies greaves and saville 1995 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 meri 2015 2015 noren 2007 all colored particles that matched anthropogenic descriptions were identified as suspected anthropogenic microparticles and microfibers all transparent colored fibers were tested for texture and identified conservatively the first ten suspected anthropogenic microparticles in each morphology and color category within each size fraction were collected on double sided tape for polymer identification collected anthropogenic microparticles and microfibers from one inlet and one outlet sample were photographed using a 5mp usb digital microscope camera from omax ojeong gu south korea section s3 and measured using toupview software from touptek photonics hangzhou china actual measurements were compared to the size fractions in which the measured particles were found 2 5 polymer identification section s4 outlines microplastic and related definitions used in this paper of the collected anthropogenic microparticles and microfibers from stormwater samples 10 per sample were randomly selected for polymer identification within each morphology and color category following two previously published subsampling methods grbić et al 2020 huntington et al 2020 this led to analyzing 482 particles i e 10 5 of total collected particles spectroscopy results are reported as percentages and were not used to correct anthropogenic microparticle concentrations used in statistical analysis plated anthropogenic microparticles and microfibers from stormwater samples and field blanks were analyzed for polymer identification with two horiba xplora plus confocal raman microscopes with lab spec6 software v 6 6 1 11 a µftir spectrometer was used to analyze all suspected black rubbery particles as they burned or did not produce interpretable spectra on the raman spectrometer section s5 prior to spectral matching baseline corrections were applied to spectra as needed raman spectra were compared to a number of commercial libraries section s5 as well as the slopp and slopp e libraries created for microplastics in environmental samples munno et al 2020 in each case the top identified material based on hit quality was selected when a spectrum matched clearly with a polymer type we report the plastic type sometimes spectra have band overlay from dyes and fillers for these samples we created our own particle identification categories anthropogenic microparticles categorized as anthropogenic synthetic were plasticizers e g fm20 pvc impact modifier anthropogenic cellulosic particles identified a dye on cellulose or on cellulose acetate anthropogenic unknown particles were identified as dyes e g indigo carmine with no added spectral information about material type munno et al 2020 co polymers were defined as microplastics composed of two or more plastic types unknown particles consisted of those where we were unable to produce a clear raman spectrum within the maximum analysis time of 20 min additionally unknown burn was a separate category for particles that burned at low raman laser settings i e 785 nm laser with a filter of 0 1 10 particles that burn quickly at such low laser settings are potentially natural based confirmed natural based categories included cellulose and cellulose acetate as well as other natural compounds e g iron oxide although cellulose acetate is a type of microplastic we conservatively reported it as natural since the spectrum for cellulose is similar to that of cellulose acetate 2 6 quality assurance and quality control qa qc an inlet and outlet autosampler field blank was collected for every sampled rain event to quantify the extent of contamination during sampling i e while the 24 1 l bottles of the autosamplers were left open to the atmosphere of the autosampler and during transportation from the field site to the field lab approximately 100 m away these included a blank isco autosample bottle at the inlet and outlet of the bioretention cell where 1 of the 24 1 l bottles was filled in advance of a rain event with reverse osmosis ro water obtained using an ro 1070 water storage tank section s3 this twenty fourth bottle was placed inside the autosampler uncapped during any antecedent dry days after setting up the sampler and for the duration of the rain event field blanks underwent the same sample preparation process as the samples in the lab 100 cotton lab coats and nitrile gloves were worn whenever handling samples glassware and sieves were washed with dish soap and tap water followed by a triple rinse with ro water before and in between uses to reduce procedural contamination two lab blanks were collected with a 1 l volume to approximately match field blank and sample volumes the lab blanks consisted of ro water that followed the same sample preparation process as a regular sample samples were quantified by more than one analyst we took several steps to try to reduce and quantify uncertainty artificial samples consisting of 30 fibers and 25 non fiber microplastic particles total 55 were prepared section s3 seven identical artificial samples were counted by seven analysts the mean and standard deviation was 79 26 n 7 i e a 33 variation among the analysts for all particles together and 53 23 n 7 i e a 43 variation for fibers only section s3 these results indicate a moderate counting reproducibility among different analysts therefore no individual rain event samples were divided among analysts for counting and inlet outlet pairs of samples were counted by the same analyst to measure repeatability one analyst counted three identical artificial samples and observed higher fiber 47 2 n 3 and total particle counts 73 3 n 3 than the spiked values at 30 and 55 respectively but with smaller standard deviations leading to very good repeatability with a corresponding variation at 4 despite efforts to avoid contamination the number of particles counted was larger than the number of particles spiked this led to moderate accuracy with corresponding error at 43 for all particles and poor accuracy 78 error for fibers only finally artificial samples n 3 were used in a spike and recovery test the recovery was 82 5 table s2 2 7 statistical analyses microparticle concentrations at the bioretention inlet and outlet were censored using non parametric survival analysis methods specifically the regression on statistics and kaplan meier methods concentrations below the average field blank concentration were considered below the limit of detection and the relative ranks of data points were used when calculating summary statistics the limit of detection lod for this process was set as the average of the inlet and outlet field blank microparticle concentrations for each size fraction and for all size fractions together and for all microparticles together including microfibers microparticles excluding microfibers and for microfibers only table s3 the shapiro wilk test was used to test data normality the paired generalized wilcoxon test was used to test significance between inlet and outlet concentrations calculations of percent concentration and load reductions and pearson correlation analysis are described in sections s3 and s6 respectively all statistical tests were performed in r with a significance level of 0 05 r development core team 2020 3 results 3 1 qa qc the two lab blanks had concentrations of 15 and 31 microparticles l the field blanks showed similar anthropogenic microparticle concentrations to the bioretention cell outlet samples with an average inlet and outlet field blank concentration of 89 and 85 particles l respectively while no lab blank correction was made on the sample microparticle concentrations the field blank average value at 87 microparticles l was used as the lod in the statistical analyses described above approximately 95 of the field blank microparticles were fibers and the lab blank consisted entirely of fibers 3 2 distribution of microplastics by morphology and color considering all sizes together inlet samples showed a wider distribution of particle morphology than outlet samples fig 1 this difference in diversity between inlet and outlet samples was less prominent in the two largest size fractions but increased in the two smallest size fractions fig s3 in both locations fibers were dominant and rubbery fragments were only found in inlet samples these results suggest that the rubbery fragments likely coming from tire wear and the recycled tire pavement of the drainage area were retained in the bioretention cell both inlet and outlet samples contained a large variety of microparticle colors but in both cases clear microparticles dominated and a lower number of black particles were found in the outlet than in the inlet fig s4 3 3 characterization of polymer types of all the inlet and outlet sample particles analyzed 78 were confirmed anthropogenic including both cellulose based or plastic based that had undergone some chemical treatment i e plastic co polymer anthropogenic synthetic anthropogenic cellulosic anthropogenic unknown fig 2 of these plastic accounted for 28 i e plastic co polymer anthropogenic synthetic cellulose related accounted for 34 i e cellulose and cellulose acetate anthropogenic cellulosic and 36 were still of unknown origin i e unknown anthropogenic unknown unknown burn the rest i e 1 was of natural origin the most frequently detected plastic polymer types observed in the inlet samples were polyester 34 polyurethane 23 and polyethylene 13 the outlet samples had similar polymer type distributions to field blanks for polyester 24 in outlet samples 20 in field blank polyurethane 12 10 and polyethylene 12 10 but they had a larger fraction of acrylic 16 0 and less pvc 4 and 30 than field blanks section s9 no particles were confirmed as plastic in the lab blank in which anthropogenic cellulosic dominated 67 section s9 the top two most frequently detected polymers i e polyester and polyurethane are commonly used in clothing while the third most detected polymer i e polyethylene is commonly used in packaging the majority of analyzed films were plastic 74 many fragments were identified as plastic 42 however some were identified as anthropogenic unknown 21 where the polymer type was masked by the dye signal nearly half of microfibers 41 were identified as cellulose or anthropogenic cellulosic and a small proportion were identified as plastic 20 limited results were obtained for the rubbery particles section s9 likely due to issues with fluorescence and infrared light absorption common for black particles as well as rubber compositions in products like tires that vary by application and can include natural rubbers as well as a host of fillers and property enhancing agents eisentraut et al 2018 käppler et al 2016 wagner et al 2018 natural based microparticles i e cellulose cellulose acetate other natural and unknown burn had similar distributions in both inlet 10 and outlet samples 12 as well as field blanks 12 3 4 effect of climatic variables on microparticle concentrations no climate variables studied were found to have a statistically significant correlation with the total anthropogenic microparticle concentrations the only statistically significant correlation was found between anthropogenic particles excluding fibers and maximum rainfall intensity spearman rho 0 56 p 0 030 section s6 however microparticle concentrations at the bioretention cell inlet appeared to be proportional to the number of antecedent dry days fig 3 low microparticle concentrations were observed with low antecedent dry days while samples collected after longer dry periods had high microplastic concentrations 3 5 bioretention cell efficiency at limiting microplastic contamination sampled rain events ranged from 2 6 to 39 mm of these events 53 were less than the bioretention cell s storage capacity of 15 mm spraakman et al 2020 outflows produced from events below this storage capacity were due to saturated soil from a previous rain event or high rainfall intensities during sample collection suspected anthropogenic microparticle hereinafter referred to as microparticles concentrations were significantly higher at the bioretention cell inlet than at the outlet p value 0 001 overall the mean concentration was 186 173 particles l at the inlet and 31 35 particles l at the outlet for all microparticles including microfibers section s11 microparticle contamination was frequently below detection limits at the outlet for 86 of the samples likewise per size fraction microparticle concentrations were significantly larger at the inlet than the outlet and were the largest for the smallest size fraction the inlet and outlet average concentrations were respectively 34 13 and 4 8 microparticles l for 1 mm 19 6 microparticles l and lod for 500 µm 1 mm 27 9 and 7 12 microparticles l for 300 500 µm and 105 157 and 7 17 microparticles l for 106 300 µm fig s10 the median microparticle percent reduction produced by the bioretention cell was 84 for all particles together including microfibers median microparticle concentrations were reduced by 76 for the 300 500 μm size range and 95 for the other three size fractions given that the bioretention cell had significant volume reduction on average at 93 12 during the monitoring period the microparticle load reductions were high for all sizes together ranging from 92 to 100 censored boxplots with concentration and load reductions for microfibers and microparticles excluding microfibers are presented in figs s11 and s12 the percent concentration reductions for the microparticles excluding microfibers were similar to those reported above for all microparticles together with an overall median microparticle concentration reduction of 89 the lowest percent concentration decrease was 45 for the 300 500 μm size range and very high concentration decreases 89 were obtained for the other three size fractions contrary to what was observed for all microparticles together the concentrations of microparticles excluding microfibers increased with decreasing size fraction in comparison all outlet microfiber concentrations were lod and microfiber concentrations did not increase or decrease with size fractions the probability distribution plot of all anthropogenic microparticles fig 4 showed that 35 and 90 of observations were lod for inlet and outlet samples respectively the hypothesis that microparticles are well removed by bioretention is supported by our data as there is a 65 chance that they will be found in stormwater influent compared to a 10 chance to be present in the effluent after bioretention filtration for all size fractions although not currently regulated future microplastic concentration targets or ecotoxicological limits can be compared to probability plots to determine the probability of exceedance 4 discussion 4 1 stormwater is a major entry pathway for microplastics in the environment our study showed that urban stormwater runoff can be associated with large concentrations of microparticles ranging up to 704 microparticles l for sizes ranging from 106 µm to 5 mm this work therefore demonstrates that urban stormwater runoff is a major entry pathway for microplastics and microfibers into the environment especially considering the low use of the sampling site i e limited daily vehicles and pedestrians and no commercial traffic even when censored for field blanks table s8 the microparticle concentrations found in this study were higher than those typically observed in stormwater and other freshwater environments table s1 for example in comparison to the three other direct urban stormwater runoff studies with particle count concentrations gilbreath et al 2019 sutton et al 2019 microparticle concentrations in our samples were 58 to 458 times higher than two of these studies gilbreath et al 2019 järlskog et al 2020 however they were similar in concentration to one study where mean concentrations for 5 sites ranged from 88 to 289 particles l exceeding our mean concentration of 186 particles l at some sampling locations piñon colin et al 2020 the kortright center drainage area was a 265 m2 impervious parking lot made of recycled tire rubber pavers whereas the drainage area of the san francisco bay bioretention study was a 4080 m2 impervious area made of 67 roads 13 buildings and 20 residential gilbreath et al 2019 in comparison the tributary san francisco stormwater study had a variety of land uses at its 12 sampling locations generally with higher proportions of residential and commercial spaces in significantly larger drainage areas compared to our study s drainage area by a factor of at least 2 0 104 sutton et al 2019 like in our study gilbreath et al 2019 sampled stormwater at its source specifically collecting runoff from pavement at ground elevation at the drainage area outlet conversely sutton et al 2019 collected stormwater further from the source in small tributaries using a depth integrated method and at one location a surface water grab sample despite the smaller but similarly highly impervious drainage area the kortright center stormwater runoff had higher microparticle concentrations than reported in gilbreath et al 2019 since we used similar methods to those from gilbreath et al 2019 i e minimum studied particle size autosample collection and visual quantification with raman verification the difference in microparticle concentration is likely explained by differences in climatic factors see next section land use and catchment area material composition as well as from dilution due to larger sample sizes differences in microparticle concentrations could also be explained by differences in sampling location relative to microplastic sources and sampling technique microplastics become more diluted as they move downstream and therefore sampling during rain events in tributaries could lead to more diluted microparticle concentrations than when samples are collected at the immediate outlet of a drainage area e g at street level or stormwater catch basin rubberized pavements are desirable as they recycle a waste material have a higher non slip surface and provide noise abatement like all pavement types they degrade over time from weathering and traffic loadings and can therefore become a source of microplastics likewise all pavements may have undesired or unintended environmental effects to ecosystems and human health such as dna damage and inflammatory effects resulting from inhalation of rubberized pavement particles baensch baltruschat et al 2020 lefevre et al 2016 rubber vulcanizers used in vehicle tire manufacturing known to be toxic to various organisms and a contact allergen for humans can leach from tire dust particles thus further contributing negative impacts on human and ecosystem health lefevre et al 2016 although we were unable to confirm their chemical composition with µftir or raman spectroscopy the rubbery particles found in stormwater in this study confirm the need for control measures to reduce their contamination in the downstream environment 4 2 rainfall intensity and antecedent dry days are climatic variables that influence the microplastic concentration in runoff our results showed that the maximum rainfall intensity was the best statistically significant predictor of anthropogenic microparticle excluding fibers concentration in urban stormwater runoff increasing rainfall intensity may influence how settled microplastics on pavements are dislodged and enter stormwater during a rain event although not statistically significant antecedent dry days also showed a positive trend with microparticle concentration which can be explained by build up of particles during increasing times between rain events we were only able to obtain samples from three events with antecedent dry days greater than 6 days due to variation in the weather however more events with similarly large dry days may lead to a more pronounced correlation similar correlations were observed between antecedent dry days and tss cheema et al 2017 gunawardena et al 2013 and for microparticle abundance and antecedent rainfall depth hitchcock 2020 an increase in microplastic load in urban stormwater runoff was also observed for rain events with increasing precipitation depth piñon colin et al 2020 other impacting factors for microplastic concentrations are land use in the drainage area grbić et al 2020 sutton et al 2019 sampling time during the hydrograph and size of the drainage area as observed for tss concentrations cheema et al 2017 suggesting that an analogy can be made between tss and microplastics therefore existing tss transport models can likely be used as a first approximation to simulate deposition and wash off mechanisms of microplastics in urban areas and predict their transport in stormwater runoff likewise some atmospheric microplastic studies have suggested that climatic factors including rainfall depth may influence microplastic concentrations in runoff allen et al 2019 dris et al 2016 2015 allen et al 2019 found a strong significant correlation between precipitation depths r 0 8 p 0 05 and microplastic count as well as a significant positive correlation r 0 9 p 0 05 between rainfall intensity and microplastic count others studying tss have found weak or no correlations between the first flush of tss concentrations and antecedent dry days deletic 1998 han et al 2006 lee et al 2002 saget et al 1996 rainfall intensity deletic 1998 han et al 2006 saget et al 1996 rainfall depth deletic 1998 saget et al 1996 and rainfall duration deletic 1998 the relationship between climatic factors and microplastic concentrations is important to construct accurate and reliable models these models can be used to explore various scenarios and quantify the impact of input variables such as land use changes and urban growth on microplastic contamination such models are needed to inform policy and support decision making more research should evaluate a wider range of antecedent dry days rainfall intensity and duration on microplastic concentrations in urban stormwater runoff longer inter event time may allow for more build up of particles in the bioretention cell drainage area including both tss and microplastics 4 3 atmospheric deposition is a major source of microfibers in urban stormwater atmospheric deposition appears to be a major pathway for microplastic entry into the environment in this study the field blanks had high concentrations of microparticles sometimes exceeding concentrations in outlet samples whereas the lab blank had lower but non null concentrations of microparticles these data demonstrate that both indoor and outdoor air microplastic contamination represents a major source of microplastics in analyzed urban stormwater therefore actions targeted to reducing air microplastic concentrations may also contribute to decreasing contamination in aquatic environments in both field blanks and bioretention cell samples fibers were the dominant type of microplastic 79 of the total number of particles observed the lab blank in comparison had a lower microparticle concentration and entirely consisted of fibers this dominance of fibers in indoor and outdoor air microplastic contamination matches the few studies to date that quantified atmospheric deposition of microplastics table s19 allen et al 2019 dris et al 2017 2016 2015 liu et al 2019b stanton et al 2019 these microfibers may have come locally from clothing of visitors and staff in the study site area or globally from long range transport of microfibers emitted in other places indeed high concentrations of microfibers were found in isolated and sparsely populated areas allen et al 2019 bergmann et al 2019 huntington et al 2020 fibers identified in the field blanks and outlet samples had similar raman spectroscopy results outlet samples and field blanks were composed of 15 and 16 plastic and 47 and 46 cellulose respectively compared to 24 plastic and 36 cellulose in the inlet samples since similar distributions of microparticle types were found in both field blanks and outlet samples they are likely from the same source of contamination thought to be atmospheric deposition raman results with 0 confirmed plastic in one lab blank supports that other cellulose based contamination came from the lab during sample processing 4 4 bioretention cells are very efficient treatment practices for microplastic contamination the first major result of this study is the demonstration of the high efficiency of bioretention cells for microplastic removal over the two year study period the bioretention cell reduced median microplastic concentrations by 84 and loads by more than 92 this is consistent with the only other existing study that incorporated microplastic data in a bioretention cell located in the san francisco bay area which reports percent concentration reductions of 90 from 2 49 to 0 25 particle l 83 from 0 41 to 0 07 particles l and 95 from 3 15 to 0 17 particles l from three inlet outlet pairs of samples gilbreath et al 2019 as a suspended solid microplastics are likely removed from stormwater within the bioretention cell through physical filtration in comparison to stormwater other aquatic pathways of microplastics into the environment have shown lower mean concentrations likely due to dilution in upstream sources such as wastewater effluent 0 063 particles l sutton et al 2019 0 05 particles l mason et al 2016 freshwater 2 78 103 1 93 105 particles km2 for four major canadian lakes anderson et al 2017 and marine water 0 00246 particles l in north east atlantic ocean lusher et al 2014 it is therefore important to mitigate the spread of microplastics at the stormwater level to prevent entry into downstream water bodies in canada it is recommended that bioretention cell media should consist of 75 90 sand 0 05 mm 2 mm in size 7 22 of silt 0 002 0 05 mm in size and 3 12 clay 0 002 mm for infiltration site specific goals canadian standards association group 2018 porosity is typically set to 0 35 0 4 canadian standards association group 2018 given that its filter media parameters follow these guidelines and that other bioretention cell guidelines list similar recommended media compositions table s7 the kortright bioretention cell is a conventional cell by design and therefore this study s data is applicable to other conventionally designed cells while pore size does not perfectly correlate with porosity pore size distribution data are rare compared to porosity data pore size distribution can increase or decrease over time due to the accumulation of fine particles brown and hunt 2012 the presence of vegetation roots and series of freezing and thawing cycles ding et al 2019 the average field derived porosity for the bioretention cell of this study was determined as 43 across the cell surface area in november 2017 spraakman et al 2020 which is within the range of typical sandy bioretention media high infiltration rates were maintained 4 5 years post construction spraakman et al 2020 in this cell thus confirming the absence of significant clogging in another bioretention cell soil from ajax on approximately 65 km away from the kortright site average pore diameters of 32 44 µm were measured using x ray tomography ding et al 2019 with a minimum sieve pore size of 106 µm all studied microparticles were theoretically larger than a large portion of the bioretention cell pore diameter and should therefore be removed by physical filtration this is consistent with the large concentration reductions and the low outlet microparticle concentrations lod for the 500 µm to 1 mm size fraction and 7 microparticles l observed for all other size fractions in our study microfibers were well removed from stormwater via the bioretention cell as their median concentration dropped from 89 97 microparticles l at the inlet to lod at the outlet for all sizes in comparison microfiber concentration had similar median concentrations in each size fraction i e 23 14 6 9 and 29 microparticles l for size fractions in decreasing order in addition 72 and 89 of particles in an inlet and outlet sample respectively were found to be outside the range of the sieve size fractions for fibers only 74 and 87 of particles were out of the sieve size fractions section s12 these similar concentrations in each size fraction and large proportions of particles out of the sieve size fractions may be due to the long narrow morphology of fibers which allowed them to pass through any sieve depending on their orientation resulting in fibers getting collected on sieves not reflective of their length in one pair of inlet outlet samples particle size measurements showed that fibers had an average diameter of 18 µm and varying lengths ranging from 47 µm to 5 mm in this inlet sample 97 of fibers in the smallest size fraction were larger in length than the upper limit of the size fraction 300 µm these results show that no interpretation of microfiber concentrations and concentration reductions can be made per size fraction when those are obtained from sieving due to the major contribution of fibers in the total microparticle counts overall microparticle concentrations and concentration reductions per size fraction cannot be interpreted either likewise microfibers may be underestimated in concentrations as their small widths may allow them to pass through the smallest sieve of 106 µm during sample processing for microparticles excluding microfibers particles in most size fractions and all sizes largely did not occur in the correct sieved size ranges except for the 106 300 µm fraction where 64 of particles were within the correct size range this size fraction of microparticles excluding microfibers had the largest concentration of the four size fractions of 45 102 microparticles l which can be explained by a larger abundance of increasingly small microparticles in the environment due to particle fragmentation through sun exposure and mechanical stress over time finally another possible factor affecting particle retention is the underdrain slot size in this study the bioretention cell underdrain had a diameter of 10 cm a maximum slot length of 22 mm and a maximum slot width of 3 mm depending on their orientation microplastic particles larger than 3 mm that infiltrated the soil and reached the underdrain may not have been able to enter the underdrain in addition the potential development of biofilm and build up of sediment on the underdrain slots can result in further reduction of the entry point size for microplastics and microfibers to the bioretention cell outlet 5 conclusion this work highlights the role of atmospheric microfiber deposition onto urban surfaces as a key input into stormwater runoff when microparticles are washed off by rain events it showed that urban stormwater can exhibit large concentrations of microparticles including natural and plastic fibers and non fiber particles while this contamination can contribute significant impairment of downstream ecosystems our bioretention cell monitoring results demonstrated that vegetated stormwater infiltration systems can be very efficient in trapping microplastics future work should evaluate the effects of media type and depth on the efficiency of microplastic retention and the contribution of microplastic to bioretention media clogging for both urban stormwater runoff and infiltration systems such as bioretention cells future research should characterize the fate of smaller particle sizes 106 µm and that of chemicals associated with microplastics these chemicals include those incorporated during plastic or cotton manufacturing and those that adsorbed onto plastic or natural particles during their transport in air or stormwater the transport and potential impact of microplastics from bioretention cells to groundwater should also be studied finally this study showed the analogy between the well studied tss and microplastics in both urban runoff and bioretention cells this suggests that existing tss fate models built to predict generation transport and fate in urban stormwater and bioretention cells can be used as a first approximation to estimate microplastics concentration in stormwater and concentration reduction in bioretention cells declaration of competing interest the
