25250,understanding the mechanisms driving species biogeography and biodiversity remains a major challenge in phytoplankton ecology using a model of two phytoplankton species with a gleaner opportunist trade off and competing for light and a limiting nutrient we show that the diel light cycle may be an essential factor to explain large scale ecological patterns when only the seasonal light cycle is considered control scenario the model predicts that independently of the nutrient supply gleaners should dominate across all latitudes and opportunists can obtain a temporal niche only at high latitudes however the diel light cycle makes the competition outcome also a function of nutrient supply by affecting the amplitude of diel nutrient oscillations with gleaners dominating when nutrient supply is low opportunists when nutrient supply is high and both species coexisting at intermediate levels of nutrient supply the combined effects of seasonal and diel light cycles diel scenario shape a latitudinal diversity gradient with decreasing diversity towards higher latitudes and a unimodal dependence of diversity on nutrient supply and therefore on ecosystem productivity the proposed mechanism can help interpret the biogeography of major phytoplankton functional groups in the global ocean and link them with large scale biodiversity patterns keywords phytoplankton biogeography biodiversity diel light cycle nutrient oscillations resource competition 1 introduction in order to understand mechanisms that govern biodiversity ecologists have focused on large scale patterns of biodiversity along environmental gradients two of the most studied global biodiversity patterns are the latitudinal biodiversity gradient and the productivity diversity relationship for many marine and terrestrial taxa there is evidence for biodiversity declining towards high latitudes willig et al 2003 hillebrand 2004 supporting the hypothesis of a global biodiversity decline from tropical to polar regions pianka 1966 the productivity biodiversity relationship although still under debate strong 2010 adler et al 2011 has been suggested to be either increasing diversity with productivity or unimodal with a maximum of diversity at intermediate productivity mittelbach et al 2001 gillman and wright 2006 fraser et al 2015 understanding whether and why such global biodiversity patterns exist is of great importance as an increasing number of empirical studies supports a strong association of biodiversity with ecosystem functioning tilman et al 2014 phytoplankton the base of plankton food webs play a major role for global ocean productivity and biogeochemical cycles although it has been suggested that the composition of microbial communities should be driven by similar rules as that of macro organisms martiny et al 2006 whether phytoplankton diversity follows consistent patterns on a global scale is not clear a latitudinal diversity gradient with decreasing diversity towards higher latitudes has been observed in freshwater phytoplankton stomp et al 2011 while measurements of marine phytoplankton diversity did not reveal any pattern cermeño et al 2008 the productivity diversity relationship in phytoplankton has been found to be unimodal peaking at intermediate productivity levels li 2002 irigoien et al 2004 stomp et al 2011 however no such relationship has been observed by cermeño et al 2013 indicating that more extensive observations are needed the complexity of ecological systems has led to a great number of hypotheses to explain the latitudinal diversity gradient pianka 1966 rohde 1992 colwell and lees 2000 allen et al 2002 barton et al 2010 and the productivity diversity relationship connell 1978 huston 1979 wright 1983 tilman 1985 palmer 1994 abrams 1995 leibold 1996 cardinale et al 2009 vallina et al 2014 trait based ecology aims to disentangle this complexity by linking functional traits of organisms with ecological patterns lavorel and garnier 2002 kneitel and chase 2004 litchman and klausmeier 2008 and to define the key trait trade offs that are necessary to explain patterns of biodiversity willig 2011 phytoplankton might be the best example to link functional traits with biodiversity patterns satellite observations have revealed consistent biogeographic patterns of phytoplankton functional types along the latitudinal and productivity gradients phytoplankton cell size a master trait of phytoplankton physiology litchman and klausmeier 2008 finkel et al 2010 marañón et al 2013 marañón 2015 increases on average with increasing productivity and latitude smaller phytoplankton cells dominate in oligotrophic environments and low latitudes e g oligotrophic subtropical gyres while larger cells dominate in eutrophic environments e g upwelling areas and high latitudes kostadinov et al 2009 brewin et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 roy et al 2013 this pattern is likely related to two important taxonomic groups of phytoplankton cyanobacteria prochlorococcus sp and diatoms small prochlorococcus sp dominate in oligotrophic environments and at low latitudes while larger size diatoms are dominant in eutrophic conditions and at high latitudes bracher et al 2009 hirata et al 2011 flombaum et al 2013 vogt et al 2013 soppa et al 2014 in phytoplankton models the dynamics of these two functional groups is often explained by the so called gleaner opportunist trade off i e a trade off between affinity for nutrient uptake and maximal growth rate follows et al 2007 small phytoplankton such as prochlorococcus sp can be characterized as gleaners as their high surface to volume ratio gives them the ability to grow faster under low nutrient concentrations marañón et al 2013 by contrast larger phytoplankton species like diatoms are considered opportunists due to their higher maximal growth rates marañón et al 2013 the existence of the gleaner opportunist trade off in phytoplankton is supported by models of cell functioning klausmeier et al 2004 arrigo 2005 resource competition theory grover 1990 and experimental observations edwards et al 2012 2013 marañón 2015 resource competition theory posits that the competitive interaction between gleaners and opportunists is tightly related with temporal variations of resources in the presence of resource variations phytoplankton species can coexist by sharing temporal niches sommer 1984 grover 1990 cermeño et al 2011 gleaners are at an advantage during phases of low resource concentrations whereas opportunists perform better during phases of high resource concentrations the most important natural factor for this mechanism of coexistence is the seasonality of light the seasonal light cycle induces oscillations of limiting nutrients as phytoplankton nutrient uptake and growth are higher during spring summer and lower during winter falkowski and raven 2013 this process leads to a general pattern of phytoplankton seasonal succession with opportunistic species dominating during the spring bloom period and gleaners during the post bloom period harris 1986 taylor et al 1993 alvain et al 2008 another factor potentially affecting the dynamics of gleaners and opportunists is the diel light cycle similarly to seasonality the diel light cycle induces oscillations of limiting nutrients because phytoplankton nutrient uptake is generally higher during the day than at night ditullio and laws 1986 harrison and denman 1991 johnson et al 2006 heffernan and cohen 2010 experimental and modelling work has shown that the diel light cycle can delay competitive exclusion thus constituting a stabilizing mechanism and affect competition outcomes between gleaners and opportunists through light induced nutrient oscillations litchman 1998 2003 litchman and klausmeier 2001 litchman et al 2004 thus phytoplankton gleaners dominate at no or only weak diel oscillations of resources as they are better competitors under constant conditions while opportunistic species dominate in the presence of stronger resource oscillations however in spite of the potential effects of the diel light cycle on the gleaner opportunist competition its potential role to understand large scale ecological patterns has not been explored here we use a zero dimensional local resource competition model to investigate the potential effects of the diel light cycle on gleaner opportunist dynamics and biodiversity along latitudinal and nutrient supply gradients comparing simulations with and without diel light cycles we show that gleaner opportunist competition under diel light oscillations might be an important factor contributing to the large scale patterns of phytoplankton biogeography and diversity 2 methods we simulate competition for light i and a limiting nutrient n between two phytoplankton species a gleaner p 1 and an opportunist p 2 table 1 the model assumes chemostat like conditions with nutrient concentration nin in the supply and dilution rate d in a zero dimensional system so the model simulations represent the results of local resource competition in a well mixed environment thus the inflow rate of nutrient equals dnin and the outflow rates are dn for nutrients and d p i for species populations the specific growth rate μ i of population p i is modelled as the product of limitations by nutrient and light using the monod and poisson models respectively eq 1 monod 1950 dubinsky et al 1986 here μ m a x is the maximal growth rate and a n is the nutrient affinity a n μ m a x k n where k n is the half saturation constant of phytoplankton growth the two competitors have a trade off between affinity for nutrient uptake and maximal growth rate gleaners have higher an and opportunists have higher μmax fig 1 gleaners compared to opportunists reach a higher growth rate when n n c r i t while opportunists grow faster when n n c r i t the level of n c r i t is indicated by the red dashed line in fig 1 the growth parameters used are within the ranges of measured values in nitrate limited phytoplankton cultures table 1 dynamics of populations are described as the balance between population specific growth and loss through outflow eq 2 while the limiting nutrient n changes as the difference between the gain of the nutrient from the supply and loss through phytoplankton nutrient uptake and outflow eq 3 1 μ i n i μ m a x i a n n a n n μ m a x i 1 e a l i 2 d p i d t μ i n i p i d p i 3 d n d t μ i n i p i d n d n i n we model the dynamics of light intensity as a function of latitude and day of year using the light equations of brock 1981 light in the subsurface layer of a water column was estimated as the light intensity at 5 m depth 4 i i b r o c k t l e k z where i b r o c k t l is the surface light intensity at latitude l and time t the light intensity in the water decreases exponentially with the light attenuation coefficient k kirk 1994 and we choose a depth of 5 m in order to focus on phytoplankton growth without the effect of strong light limitation due to vertical attenuation brock s equations describe the light intensity at the ocean surface under a clear sky as a function of latitude day of year and time of day the seasonal and diel variations in light intensity affect phytoplankton growth and therefore nutrient consumption which in turn induces oscillations of nutrient concentrations during spring phytoplankton nutrient uptake increases and nutrient concentrations drop to a minimal level in summer during autumn nutrient uptake decreases and nutrient concentrations approach those in the nutrient supply n i n in winter a similar mechanism causes diel nutrient oscillations with nutrients dropping during the day and increasing during the night in order to investigate the effects of the diel light cycle along the latitudinal and productivity gradients we simulate the model for light conditions of different latitudes 0 70 n and nutrient supply concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 17 μm nitrate encompassing nitrate concentrations from oligotrophic to eutrophic regions marañón et al 2014 to disentangle the effects of seasonal and diel light cycles we examine two scenarios for light intensity 1 in the control scenario light intensity is constant throughout each day and equal to the average diel light intensity but varies seasonally fig 3 2 in the diel scenario the seasonal light cycle is complemented with the diel cycle in accordance with the conditions at the given latitude fig 4 in order to minimize the influence of the initial conditions we run all simulations for five years to get a repeating annual time course this model time span was enough to obtain less than 1 difference between the annual average of total biomass during the last two successive years for all simulations the annual mean of competition outcomes and biodiversity were calculated during the last 5th year of our simulations competition outcomes were characterized by the annual mean ratio of opportunist biomass to total biomass this quantity equals 0 when only the gleaner is present 0 5 when both populations are equally abundant and 1 when only the opportunist is present biodiversity was calculated as the annual mean effective species number defined as the exponent of shannon index leinster and cobbold 2012 the effective species number ranges from 1 when only gleaners or opportunists survive to 2 when both populations are equally abundant 3 results simulations considering seasonal light cycles only control scenario show a transition of dominance from gleaners to coexistence of gleaners and opportunists with latitude fig 2 a thus the control scenario predicts that independently of nutrient supply concentrations diversity increases with latitude fig 2c the competition outcomes change drastically in the diel scenario where both seasonal and diel light cycles are included fig 2b here gleaners dominate only in the range of low latitudes with low nutrient supply while opportunists dominate at high nutrient supply concentrations and high latitudes these competition outcomes lead to a unimodal dependence of diversity on the nutrient supply at low and temperate latitudes with a maximum of diversity at intermediate nutrient supply fig 2d the unimodal relationship is strongest at equator weakens at temperate latitudes and disappears poleward of 45 n the weakening of the unimodal relationship with latitude leads to a decrease in diversity with latitude for intermediate nutrient supplies from 6 5 to 13 μmol l 1 as productivity increases monotonically with nutrient supply fig s1 this result can be interpreted as a unimodal relationship of diversity with productivity the general mechanism shaping these patterns is the periodic nutrient oscillations driven by light cycles affecting the competition outcome between gleaners and opportunists in the control scenario the seasonal light changes at low latitudes are not strong enough to induce seasonal nutrient oscillations fig 3 0 and 30 n under these conditions independently of the nutrient supply gleaners outcompete opportunists as they deplete nutrient concentration to the level at which opportunists cannot survive tilman 1980 at latitudes higher than 50 n the seasonality of light induces strong nutrient oscillations fig 3 60 n and both populations coexist by sharing seasonal niches opportunists dominate during the spring bloom period when nutrient concentrations are greater than n c r i t see fig 1 while gleaners become dominant during summer when nutrient concentrations drop to a level below n c r i t this difference in the nutrient conditions between high and low latitudes matches the latitudinal variations in the annual average day time nutrient concentrations the isoline at which the average day time nutrient concentrations equal n c r i t red dashed line in fig 2a mostly resides in a narrow latitude band between 45 n and 50 n and divides the phase plane into a northern part with average nutrient levels greater than n c r i t and a southern part with average nutrient levels smaller than n c r i t in the diel scenario the daily light oscillations generate an additional transition from the dominance of gleaners to the dominance of opportunists with increasing nutrient supply fig 4 the mechanism of this transition is similar to the seasonal species turnover described above but occurs on a diel time scale as shown in fig 5 the diel light cycle increases nutrient uptake during the day and decreases it during the night leading to diel nutrient oscillations when the nutrient supply is low the amplitude of diel nutrient oscillations is small nutrient concentrations never rise above n c r i t and therefore the growth rate of opportunists is always smaller than the growth rate of gleaners fig 5 left however with increasing nutrient supply the amplitude of nutrient oscillations increases so that the daily maxima of nutrient concentration exceed n c r i t providing a temporal niche for opportunists both the duration of conditions favorable for opportunists and the difference in growth rate increase with nutrient supply fig 5 middle and right this leads first to the coexistence of both populations fig 4 middle and then to the competitive exclusion of gleaners by opportunists fig 4 right this change in the competition outcomes can again be illustrated by the n c r i t isoline red dashed line fig 2b unlike the control scenario in the diel scenario this isoline is restricted to latitudes south of 45 n and stays within a relatively small range of nitrate supply concentrations 6 μm it matches the pattern of competition outcomes and separates the range with low average day time nutrient concentrations at low nutrient supply from the range with high average day time nutrient levels at high nutrient supply 4 discussion our modelling analysis stresses the importance of the diel light cycle for understanding patterns of phytoplankton biogeography and diversity along the latitudinal and productivity gradients in order to focus on the main mechanism we consider a zero dimensional chemostat like model where gleaners and opportunists compete for light and a limiting nutrient competition was simulated under two different light regimes 1 only seasonal light cycles control scenario and 2 both seasonal and diel light cycles diel scenario to focus on the effects of light cycles and productivity we use a highly simplified model which does not consider factors affecting spatial dynamics of phytoplankton e g vertical or horizontal diffusion of biomass and nutrients spatial gradients of light and nutrients and variations of nutrient turnover rates and mixed layer depths simulating the model for different latitudinal conditions of light and nutrient supply we show that independent of nutrient supply seasonal light oscillations only control scenario lead to a transition from dominance of gleaners at low latitudes to coexistence of both populations at high latitudes fig 2a and c thus contradictory to observations supporting a decreasing latitudinal diversity gradient willig et al 2003 hillebrand 2004 however simulations with both seasonal and diel light cycles diel scenario show a strong effect of nutrient supply on the competition outcome by inducing diel nutrient oscillations with gleaners dominating only at low latitudes and low nutrient supply and opportunists dominating at high latitudes and high nutrient supply fig 2b the competition outcomes of the diel scenario lead to a latitudinal diversity gradient with decreasing diversity with latitude and a unimodal relationship between productivity and diversity fig 2d the results of the diel scenario agree thus better with observations on phytoplankton biogeography and large scale biodiversity patterns the transition from dominance of gleaners to dominance of opportunists with productivity and latitude can be associated with transitions in phytoplankton cell size distribution kostadinov et al 2009 brewin et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 roy et al 2013 and shifts in the distributions of major taxonomic groups cyanobacteria diatoms in the global ocean bracher et al 2009 hirata et al 2011 flombaum et al 2013 vogt et al 2013 soppa et al 2014 furthermore our simulations also agree with observed large scale patterns of phytoplankton diversity such as the decrease of diversity with increasing latitude stomp et al 2011 and the unimodal productivity diversity relationship li 2002 irigoien et al 2004 stomp et al 2011 indicating that the diel light cycle may be an important factor linking species biogeography with biodiversity patterns in global ocean models addressing phytoplankton biogeography a framework has been established in which the gleaner opportunist trade off and selective predation play a central role follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 prowe et al 2012 ward et al 2012 prowe et al 2014 these studies similar to our model have described the increasing fitness of opportunists over gleaners with increasing latitude and attributed it to the seasonality of limiting resources however the same transition of dominance with nutrient supply has been mainly attributed to selective predation considering that increasing nutrient supply leads to higher zooplankton grazing rates that in turn increase the relative fitness of large phytoplankton cells kiørboe 1993 hansen et al 1994 1997 irigoien et al 2005 applications of this framework have led to several hypotheses regarding the origins of global biodiversity patterns in phytoplankton barton et al 2010 showed that the higher number of coexisting gleaner types at low latitudes and coexistence of fewer opportunistic species at high latitudes can explain a decreasing latitudinal diversity gradient of phytoplankton in the global ocean vallina et al 2014 studied the productivity diversity relationship in marine phytoplankton showing that kill the winner predation can lead to a unimodal productivity diversity relationship our results suggest that the effect of the diel light cycle on nutrient dynamics can contribute to shaping both a decreasing latitudinal diversity gradient and a unimodal productivity diversity relationship thus suggesting an additional biodiversity mechanism to be explored in a global ecosystem setting going beyond the classic gleaner opportunist trade off diel light cycles might help to understand the role of additional phytoplankton physiological traits such as nutrient storage and pigments for light harvesting in our model nutrient uptake is directly coupled with light harvesting as a result accumulation of nutrients during the nighttime drives diel nutrient oscillations although diel oscillations of limiting nutrients are observed in aquatic systems harrison and denman 1991 johnson et al 2006 the ability of phytoplankton to store nutrients sommer 1984 pedersen and borum 1997 should dampen the amplitude of nutrient oscillations indicating that species specialized on storing nutrients during the night can obtain a competitive advantage furthermore phytoplankton exhibit a high diversity in pigment composition among species specialized in harvesting different parts of the light spectrum kirk 1994 stomp et al 2004 falkowski and raven 2013 diel variations of the light spectrum in the water column might offer an additional mechanism for creating temporal niches and allowing coexistence of various phytoplankton

diversity towards higher latitudes has been observed in freshwater phytoplankton stomp et al 2011 while measurements of marine phytoplankton diversity did not reveal any pattern cermeño et al 2008 the productivity diversity relationship in phytoplankton has been found to be unimodal peaking at intermediate productivity levels li 2002 irigoien et al 2004 stomp et al 2011 however no such relationship has been observed by cermeño et al 2013 indicating that more extensive observations are needed the complexity of ecological systems has led to a great number of hypotheses to explain the latitudinal

environments e g upwelling areas and high latitudes kostadinov et al 2009 brewin et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 roy et al 2013 this pattern is likely related to two important taxonomic groups of phytoplankton cyanobacteria prochlorococcus sp and diatoms small prochlorococcus sp dominate in oligotrophic environments and at low latitudes while larger size diatoms are dominant in eutrophic conditions and at high latitudes bracher et al 2009 hirata et al 2011 flombaum et al 2013 vogt et al 2013 soppa et al 2014 in phytoplankton models the dynamics of these two functional groups is often explained by the so called gleaner opportunist trade off i e a trade off between affinity for nutrient uptake and maximal growth rate follows et al 2007 small phytoplankton such as prochlorococcus sp can be characterized as gleaners as their high surface to volume ratio gives them the ability to grow faster under low nutrient concentrations marañón et al 2013 by contrast larger phytoplankton species like diatoms are considered opportunists due to their higher maximal growth rates marañón et al 2013 the existence of the gleaner opportunist trade off in phytoplankton is supported by models of cell functioning klausmeier et al 2004 arrigo 2005 resource competition theory grover 1990 and experimental observations edwards et al 2012 2013 marañón 2015 resource competition theory posits that the competitive interaction between gleaners and opportunists is tightly related with temporal variations of resources in the presence of resource variations phytoplankton species can coexist by sharing temporal niches sommer 1984 grover 1990 cermeño et al 2011 gleaners are at an advantage during phases of low resource concentrations whereas opportunists perform better during phases of high resource concentrations the most important natural factor for this mechanism of coexistence is the seasonality of light the seasonal light cycle induces oscillations of limiting nutrients as phytoplankton nutrient uptake and growth are higher during spring summer and lower during winter falkowski and raven 2013 this process leads to a general pattern of phytoplankton seasonal succession with opportunistic species dominating during the spring bloom period and gleaners during the post bloom period harris 1986 taylor et al 1993 alvain et al 2008 another factor potentially affecting the dynamics of gleaners and opportunists is the diel light cycle similarly to seasonality the diel light cycle induces oscillations of limiting nutrients because phytoplankton nutrient uptake is generally higher during the day than at night ditullio and laws 1986 harrison and denman 1991 johnson et al 2006 heffernan and cohen 2010 experimental and modelling work has shown that the diel light cycle can delay competitive exclusion thus constituting a stabilizing mechanism and affect competition outcomes between gleaners and opportunists through light induced nutrient oscillations litchman 1998 2003 litchman and klausmeier 2001 litchman et al 2004 thus phytoplankton gleaners dominate at no or only weak diel oscillations of resources as they are better competitors under constant conditions while opportunistic species dominate in the presence of stronger resource oscillations however in spite of the potential effects of the diel light cycle on the gleaner opportunist competition its potential role to understand large scale ecological patterns has not been explored here we use a zero dimensional local resource competition model to investigate the potential effects of the diel light cycle on gleaner opportunist dynamics and biodiversity along latitudinal and nutrient supply gradients comparing simulations with and without diel light cycles we show that gleaner opportunist competition under diel light oscillations might be an important factor contributing to the large scale patterns of phytoplankton biogeography and diversity 2 methods we simulate competition for light i and a limiting nutrient n between two phytoplankton species a gleaner p 1 and an opportunist p 2 table 1 the model assumes chemostat like conditions with nutrient concentration nin in the supply and dilution rate d in a zero dimensional system so the model simulations represent the results of local resource competition in a well mixed environment thus the inflow rate of nutrient equals dnin and the outflow rates are dn for nutrients and d p i for species populations the specific growth rate μ i of population p i is modelled as the product of limitations by nutrient and light using the monod and poisson models respectively eq 1 monod 1950 dubinsky et al 1986 here μ m a x is the maximal growth rate and a n is the nutrient affinity a n μ m a x k n where k n is the half saturation constant of phytoplankton growth the two competitors have a trade off between affinity for nutrient uptake and maximal growth rate gleaners have higher an and opportunists have higher μmax fig 1 gleaners compared to opportunists reach a higher growth rate when n n c r i t while opportunists grow faster when n n c r i t the level of n c r i t is indicated by the red dashed line in fig 1 the growth parameters used are within the ranges of measured values in nitrate limited phytoplankton cultures table 1 dynamics of populations are described as the balance between population specific growth and loss through outflow eq 2 while the limiting nutrient n changes as the difference between the gain of the nutrient from the supply and loss through phytoplankton nutrient uptake and outflow eq 3 1 μ i n i μ m a x i a n n a n n μ m a x i 1 e a l i 2 d p i d t μ i n i p i d p i 3 d n d t μ i n i p i d n d n i n we model the dynamics of light intensity as a function of latitude and day of year using the light equations of brock 1981 light in the subsurface layer of a water column was estimated as the light intensity at 5 m depth 4 i i b r o c k t l e k z where i b r o c k t l is the surface light intensity at latitude l and time t the light intensity in the water decreases exponentially with the light attenuation coefficient k kirk 1994 and we choose a depth of 5 m in order to focus on phytoplankton growth without the effect of strong light limitation due to vertical attenuation brock s equations describe the light intensity at the ocean surface under a clear sky as a function of latitude day of year and time of day the seasonal and diel variations in light intensity affect phytoplankton growth and therefore nutrient consumption which in turn induces oscillations of nutrient concentrations during spring phytoplankton nutrient uptake increases and nutrient concentrations drop to a minimal level in summer during autumn nutrient uptake decreases and nutrient concentrations approach those in the nutrient supply n i n in winter a similar mechanism causes diel nutrient oscillations with nutrients dropping during the day and increasing during the night in order to investigate the effects of the diel light cycle along the latitudinal and productivity gradients we simulate the model for light conditions of different latitudes 0 70 n and nutrient supply concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 17 μm nitrate encompassing nitrate concentrations from oligotrophic to eutrophic regions marañón et al 2014 to disentangle the effects of seasonal and diel light cycles we examine two scenarios for light intensity 1 in the control scenario light intensity is constant throughout each day and equal to the average diel light intensity but varies seasonally fig 3 2 in the diel scenario the seasonal light cycle is complemented with the diel cycle in accordance with the conditions at the given latitude fig 4 in order to minimize the influence of the initial conditions we run all simulations for five years to get a repeating annual time course this model time span was enough to obtain less than 1 difference between the annual average of total biomass during the last two successive years for all simulations the annual mean of competition outcomes and biodiversity were calculated during the last 5th year of our simulations competition outcomes were characterized by the annual mean ratio of opportunist biomass to total biomass this quantity equals 0 when only the gleaner is present 0 5 when both populations are equally abundant and 1 when only the opportunist is present biodiversity was calculated as the annual mean effective species number defined as the exponent of shannon index leinster and cobbold 2012 the effective species number ranges from 1 when only gleaners or opportunists survive to 2 when both populations are equally abundant 3 results simulations considering seasonal light cycles only control scenario show a transition of dominance from gleaners to coexistence of gleaners and opportunists with latitude fig 2 a thus the control scenario predicts that independently of nutrient supply concentrations diversity increases with latitude fig 2c the competition outcomes change drastically in the diel scenario where both seasonal and diel light cycles are included fig 2b here gleaners dominate only in the range of low latitudes with low nutrient supply while opportunists dominate at high nutrient supply concentrations and high latitudes these competition outcomes lead to a unimodal dependence of diversity on the nutrient supply at low and temperate latitudes with a maximum of diversity at intermediate nutrient supply fig 2d the unimodal relationship is strongest at equator weakens at temperate latitudes and disappears poleward of 45 n the weakening of the unimodal relationship with latitude leads to a decrease in diversity with latitude for intermediate nutrient supplies from 6 5 to 13 μmol l 1 as productivity increases monotonically with nutrient supply fig s1 this result can be interpreted as a unimodal relationship of diversity with productivity the general mechanism shaping these patterns is the periodic nutrient oscillations driven by light cycles affecting the competition outcome between gleaners and opportunists in the control scenario the seasonal light changes at low latitudes are not strong enough to induce seasonal nutrient oscillations fig 3 0 and 30 n under these conditions independently of the nutrient supply gleaners outcompete opportunists as they deplete nutrient concentration to the level at which opportunists cannot survive tilman 1980 at latitudes higher than 50 n the seasonality of light induces strong nutrient oscillations fig 3 60 n and both populations coexist by sharing seasonal niches opportunists dominate during the spring bloom period when nutrient concentrations are greater than n c r i t see fig 1 while gleaners become dominant during summer when nutrient concentrations drop to a level below n c r i t this difference in the nutrient conditions between high and low latitudes matches the latitudinal variations in the annual average day time nutrient concentrations the isoline at which the average day time nutrient concentrations equal n c r i t red dashed line in fig 2a mostly resides in a narrow latitude band between 45 n and 50 n and divides the phase plane into a northern part with average nutrient levels greater than n c r i t and a southern part with average nutrient levels smaller than n c r i t in the diel scenario the daily light oscillations generate an additional transition from the dominance of gleaners to the dominance of opportunists with increasing nutrient supply fig 4 the mechanism of this transition is similar to the seasonal species turnover described above but occurs on a diel time scale as shown in fig 5 the diel light cycle increases nutrient uptake during the day and decreases it during the night leading to diel nutrient oscillations when the nutrient supply is low the amplitude of diel nutrient oscillations is small nutrient concentrations never rise above n c r i t and therefore the growth rate of opportunists is always smaller than the growth rate of gleaners fig 5 left however with increasing nutrient supply the amplitude of nutrient oscillations increases so that the daily maxima of nutrient concentration exceed n c r i t providing a temporal niche for opportunists both the duration of conditions favorable for opportunists and the difference in growth rate increase with nutrient supply fig 5 middle and right this leads first to the coexistence of both populations fig 4 middle and then to the competitive exclusion of gleaners by opportunists fig 4 right this change in the competition outcomes can again be illustrated by the n c r i t isoline red dashed line fig 2b unlike the control scenario in the diel scenario this isoline is restricted to latitudes south of 45 n and stays within a relatively small range of nitrate supply concentrations 6 μm it matches the pattern of competition outcomes and separates the range with low average day time nutrient concentrations at low nutrient supply from the range with high average day time nutrient levels at high nutrient supply 4 discussion our modelling analysis stresses the importance of the diel light cycle for understanding patterns of phytoplankton biogeography and diversity along the latitudinal and productivity gradients in order to focus on the main mechanism we consider a zero dimensional chemostat like model where gleaners and opportunists compete for light and a limiting nutrient competition was simulated under two different light regimes 1 only seasonal light cycles control scenario and 2 both seasonal and diel light cycles diel scenario to focus on the effects of light cycles and productivity we use a highly simplified model which does not consider factors affecting spatial dynamics of phytoplankton e g vertical or horizontal diffusion of biomass and nutrients spatial gradients of light and nutrients and variations of nutrient turnover rates and mixed layer depths simulating the model for different latitudinal conditions of light and nutrient supply we show that independent of nutrient supply seasonal light oscillations only control scenario lead to a transition from dominance of gleaners at low latitudes to coexistence of both populations at high latitudes fig 2a and c thus contradictory to observations supporting a decreasing latitudinal diversity gradient willig et al 2003 hillebrand 2004 however simulations with both seasonal and diel light cycles diel scenario show a strong effect of nutrient supply on the competition outcome by inducing diel nutrient oscillations with gleaners dominating only at low latitudes and low nutrient supply and opportunists dominating at high latitudes and high nutrient supply fig 2b the competition outcomes of the diel scenario lead to a latitudinal diversity gradient with decreasing diversity with latitude and a unimodal relationship between productivity and diversity fig 2d the results of the diel scenario agree thus better with observations on phytoplankton biogeography and large scale biodiversity patterns the transition from dominance of gleaners to dominance of opportunists with productivity and latitude can be associated with transitions in phytoplankton cell size distribution kostadinov et al 2009 brewin et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 roy et al 2013 and shifts in the distributions of major taxonomic groups cyanobacteria diatoms in the global ocean bracher et al 2009 hirata et al 2011 flombaum et al 2013 vogt et al 2013 soppa et al 2014 furthermore our simulations also agree with observed large scale patterns of phytoplankton diversity such as the decrease of diversity with increasing latitude stomp et al 2011 and the unimodal productivity diversity relationship li 2002 irigoien et al 2004 stomp et al 2011 indicating that the diel light cycle may be an important factor linking species biogeography with biodiversity patterns in global ocean models addressing phytoplankton biogeography a framework has been established in which the gleaner opportunist trade off and selective predation play a central role follows et al 2007 dutkiewicz et al 2009 prowe et al 2012 ward et al 2012 prowe et al 2014 these studies similar to our model have described the increasing fitness of opportunists over gleaners with increasing latitude and attributed it to the seasonality of limiting resources however the same transition of dominance with nutrient supply has been mainly attributed to selective predation considering that increasing nutrient supply leads to higher zooplankton grazing rates that in turn increase the relative fitness of large phytoplankton cells kiørboe 1993 hansen et al 1994 1997 irigoien et al 2005 applications of this framework have led to several hypotheses regarding the origins of global biodiversity patterns in phytoplankton barton et al 2010 showed that the higher number of coexisting gleaner types at low latitudes and coexistence of fewer opportunistic species at high latitudes can explain a decreasing latitudinal diversity gradient of phytoplankton in the global ocean vallina et al 2014 studied the productivity diversity relationship in marine phytoplankton showing that kill the winner predation can lead to a unimodal productivity diversity relationship our results suggest that the effect of the diel light cycle on nutrient dynamics can contribute to shaping both a decreasing latitudinal diversity gradient and a unimodal productivity diversity relationship thus suggesting an additional biodiversity mechanism to be explored in a global ecosystem setting going beyond the classic gleaner opportunist trade off diel light cycles might help to understand the role of additional phytoplankton physiological traits such as nutrient storage and pigments for light harvesting in our model nutrient uptake is directly coupled with light harvesting as a result accumulation of nutrients during the nighttime drives diel nutrient oscillations although diel oscillations of limiting nutrients are observed in aquatic systems harrison and denman 1991 johnson et al 2006 the ability of phytoplankton to store nutrients sommer 1984 pedersen and borum 1997 should dampen the amplitude of nutrient oscillations indicating that species specialized on storing nutrients during the night can obtain a competitive advantage furthermore phytoplankton exhibit a high diversity in pigment composition among species specialized in harvesting different parts of the light spectrum kirk 1994 stomp et al 2004 falkowski and raven 2013 diel variations of the light spectrum in the water column might offer an additional mechanism for creating temporal niches and allowing coexistence of various phytoplankton

25251,tradeoffs are supposed to play a key role in driving the maintenance and the generation of biodiversity although an extensive literature exists on the effect of single tradeoffs the interplay of simultaneous tradeoffs is not well studied especially from an ecological point of view we propose an adaptive resource based model with tradeoffs at the level of resource acquisition and processing which allows us to assess the level of specialization of populations and how it depends on tradeoff characteristics and environmental conditions furthermore we analyze the effect of structuring on such measurements for such purpose the results of the spatial model are compared to those from the well mixed counterpart as well as to the case in which the influence kin selection is mitigated among our findings we observe that the existence of multiple tradeoffs drives the individuals to higher efficiencies in the process of conversion of resource into energy additionally the results demonstrate that structuring leads to more specialization in almost every scenario surveyed keywords evolutionary theory tradeoff trait adaptation 1 introduction a tradeoff is a functional relationship between two traits which occurs everytime an increase in fitness due to a change in one trait is linked to a detrimental change in a second trait stearns 1989 saeki et al 2014 amado and campos 2017 this gives rise to a negative correlation between these two fitness components tradeoffs have been an issue of intense inquiry in the context of life history theory and are key to the understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics stearns 1989 bell 1980 roff and fairbairn 2007 the most classical example of a tradeoff in life history traits is the one concerning reproductive effort and future survival and reproduction bell 1980 roff and fairbairn 2007 being demonstrated in a huge body of studies reznick 1985 blomquist 2009 tradeoffs are assumed to be a driving mechanism of species diversity patterns in communities kneitel and chase 2004 interspecific tradeoffs play a key role in determining species coexistence in communities especially at small spatial scales thus impacting ecosystem processes tilman 1990 2000 chesson 2000 despite their importance to life history theory there is a historical difficulty in assessing tradeoffs due to the fact that tradeoffs are likely to occur in multiple dimensions edwards et al 2011 for example functional constraints between two fitness related traits may not be seem as a negative trait correlation as it can be masked by strong environmental variation in resource acquisition van noordwijk et al 1986 in this sense the huge body of lab experiments with microbes has provided a unique opportunity for probing the essence of the tradeoffs as well as their influence on spatial structure and dynamics of microbial communities litchman et al 2015 in particular the trait based framework has been developed and employed in lab experiments with microbes to assess community composition and to identify the main mechanisms that rule the fate of those microbial communities litchman and klausmeier 2008 wallenstein and hall 2012 krause et al 2014 most of the recent progress is concerned with their metabolic strategies mainly focusing on surveying how resource acquisition and utilization traits can impact community composition and its feedback to the environment lavorel and garnier 2002 owing to biophysical constraints the species cannot optimize all traits simultaneously and form a superspecies that will drive all other species extinct tilman 1982 growth and efficiency is such an example in fact the energy cost due to additional synthesis of protein devoted to nutrient transportation at the expense of synthesizing others reduces the net yield at which the nutrient is converted into usable energy pfeiffer et al 2001 maclean 2008 wong et al 2009 frank 2010 despite the considerable efforts unleashed in recent years many tradeoffs are still unveiled and undocumented and even not addressed within a theoretical perspective the first step should be to identify the important functional traits hence tradeoffs could be detected by surveying community response to environmental variation edwards et al 2011 litchman et al 2015 the situation can be more subtle as multi dimensional tradeoffs are also observed such as the three way tradeoff between nitrogen and phosphorus competitive abilities and cell size edwards et al 2011 the portrayal of the shape of a tradeoff relationship is also of great value as it can rule out ecological interactions yielding different evolutionary predictions jessup and bohannan 2008 hoyle et al 2008 however due to different ecological feedbacks their implications may depend not only on the tradeoff being considered but also on the ecological scenario hoyle et al 2008 some insights have been gained about how the shape of a tradeoff relationship affects the outcome of the evolutionary dynamics and more precisely how it influences levels of specialization and division of labor within groups colonies this problem has been mostly debated within the context of germ soma specialization and its consequence to the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms michod et al 2006 leslie et al 2017 gavrilets 2010 amado et al 2018b 2016 these works demonstrate that the curvature of the tradeoffs is key for the within group dynamics with cell specialization and division of labor evolving under convex tradeoffs whereas for concave and linear tradeoffs selection against specialization is quite robust michod et al 2006 in the current work we aim to investigate how environmental conditions such as resource availability can impact the composition and more specifically how it affects the levels of specialization in a given population contrary to previous approaches in which this problem has been mainly discussed within the framework of specialization inside groups and its consequences to the appearance of a higher level of biological organization here the motivation lies on more ecological groundings more importantly here we address how the interplay between multiple tradeoffs can change the predictions from the ones verified under simpler scenarios we will investigate how the coupling among the tradeoffs and their shapes can change evolutionary outcomes and their response to ecological feedbacks in comparison with the known results for single tradeoff situations in our modelling the evolutionary dynamics is driven by resource availability the system is adaptive as it is assumed that through mutation individuals can evolve the resource uptake rates and their corresponding efficiencies in transforming the resources into usable energy in order to explore the system we rely on resource based computer simulations the impact of structuring is also addressed with this intent the results of the spatially structured population model is contrasted to those found for well mixed populations in order to probe and relieve the influence of kinship selection in our outcomes a modified version of the original spatial model is also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model the problem of the coupling among multiple tradeoffs is here addressed within a framework of adaptive resource based modelling as such it is assumed that there exists an inflow of two different resources into the system here denoted as r 1 and r 2 the population consists of organisms that compete for the two resources and the strength of this competition will be primarily determined by the individuals resource uptake rates the individuals with larger resource uptake rates are stronger competitors i e they seize a larger portion of the resources the seized resources are then converted into energy leading to biomass growth as the individual s energy repository attains a threshold value e split the organism undergoes binary fission with each offspring inheriting half of the parent s energy storage individuals are also vulnerable to removal death which takes place at a constant rate ν the system is adaptive as during replication daughter cells can differ from their parents in their metabolic properties the population is spatially structured and so resource diffusion is explicitly considered with resource diluting faster in the direction of larger resource gradients in the following the model will be detailedly described for the sake of simplicity one can think of the organisms as single cell organisms like bacteria 2 1 1 resource uptake and conversion into energy as aforementioned the individuals in the population are provided with two different resources r 1 and r 2 and their abilities in competing for the resources are outlined by the uptake constants a k k 1 2 for the sake of clarity table 1 summarizes the meanings of the parameters the population is distributed over a square lattice of size l l each site of the lattice can be occupied by at most one individual there exists a continuous supply of resource to the system which we denote by δs 1 and δs 2 1 1 we will shorten this to δs quite often since the same influx rate is considered in the simulations for each resource whenever a parameter does not include resource index it can be assumed to be the same for both resources the total influx of resource into the system is distributed over the lattice n loc locations sites are randomly chosen to act as food sources which means that every time step an amount δs k n loc of a given resource is added to each of those locations the choices of the n loc locations occur independently for each resource type and these locations remain in the same place for the duration of each simulation the resources spread out on the lattice through diffusion in the implementation one employs a discretized version of the diffusion equation 1 ds k r t dt d 2 s k r t in which the diffusion parameter d is a constant and s k denotes the amount of the resource type k in position r at time t for each site one collects the information about the amount of each resource type the flow of resource will be larger in the direction of the largest gradient each individual can only seize resources which are available in its location at each time step the amount of resource type k caught by an individual in position i j of the grid is estimated as 2 j i j k a i j k s i j k s i j k a i j k δ t where once again a i j k corresponds to the uptake rate of resource r k pfeiffer et al 2001 note that the above definition is alternative to the classical models based on monod and michaelis menten formulations rockwood 2015 in the above equation we simply look for a function that approaches zero when the amount of resource in a given location is small and saturates when the resource abounds as we address tradeoffs involving resource consumption it is quite important to choose a proper function that does not depend on many parameters instead if one assumed a general michaelis menten form one would have to deal with additional parameters making the approach more cumbersome the factor δt is explicitly included in order to fulfill a consistent dimensional analysis nevertheless we take δt 1 since our simulations are defined in discrete time the next stage corresponds to the conversion of the seized resources into energy the amount of energy assembled in the process depends on the efficiency of the metabolic machinery and may vary between resource types as well as among individuals in the following η i j k stands for the efficiency of the process of conversion of resource k into energy for individual at position i j the increase of the energetic reservoir for the individual in position i j is thus given by 3 δ e i j k j i j k η i j k e max 1 η i j k e min where the sum is taken over the two resource types and e max and e min corresponds to upper and lower bounds of this conversion process if we picture single cell organisms such as bacteria or yeast η denotes the efficiency of their metabolic pathway and as η increases one switches from an inefficient mode of metabolism e g fermentation to an efficient mode e g cellular respiration in such case one can assign e max 36 and e min 2 as for respiration each glucose molecule is converted into 36 atp molecules whereas for the fermentation mode only two atp molecules are obtained from one glucose molecule therefore we expect that the energy increase will be proportional to those quantities although our formulation can be considered in a more general context not only applied to microorganisms e max 36 and e min 2 will be used as reference values in this work we will focus on studying the level of specialization achieved under diverse tradeoff and environmental conditions as a measure of the specialization level in a population we will consider the fraction of individuals for which the ratio between parameters surpasses a certain threshold r spec for the case of specialization in yield we sum the contributions due to each resource resulting in a specialization level that can take values in the range 0 2 as an illustration we will say that an individual is specialized in seizing the resource r 1 if a 1 a 2 r spec and that it is specialized in capturing r 2 if a 2 a 1 r spec if none of these conditions are verified we label the individual as generalist for the purposes of this analysis we take r spec 2 5 the same reasoning applies when the traits under scrutiny are uptake rate and efficiency 2 1 2 reproduction mutation and death the energy storage of each individual increases everytime food is converted into energy in real organisms this energy is used to carry out all the biochemical processes inside the cell hence leading to a biomass increase if we think of unicellular organisms their biomass cannot grow indefinitely but as its volume reaches a critical size controlling mechanisms are triggered and the process of cell division is initiated similarly one assumes that as the energy level of a given individual reaches the critical value e split cell division occurs with daughter cells inheriting half of the parent s energy level at this point the daughter cells are not metabolically identical to their parent but can differ slightly during replication mutations occur and so the uptake rates can be affected the resulting change is considerably small and denoted by δa in the simulations δa is set at δa 0 02 quite small compared to typical values of a k considered in the simulations besides reproducing individuals die at a constant rate ν initially the population is isogenic i e the metabolic properties of any individual are exactly the same the uptake rate a 1 is set at a 1 a max 2 and all other quantities are derived from a 1 using the tradeoff relationships as we deal with structured populations the reproduction process is constrained to include the focal site and its neighborhood for which the von neumann neighborhood is considered fig 1 presents an illustration of the basic processes of the model when a cell divides one of the daughter cells remain in the focal site whereas the remaining one is placed at a randomly chosen empty neighbor site if there is no empty site in its neighborhood the daughter cell randomly replaces one of its neighbors the equilibrium results from the balance between reproduction and death but also from competition arising due to space limitation 2 2 tradeoffs a key feature of the current modelling is that tradeoffs play a relevant role in forging the evolutionary dynamics the model relies on the premise of existence of multiple tradeoffs which rule the relationship between uptake rates and between uptake rates and the efficiencies of their corresponding metabolic pathways those tradeoffs are corroborated by empirical studies especially in microbial communities maclean and gudelj 2006 maclean 2008 pfeiffer et al 2001 litchman et al 2015 a higher uptake rate can allow organisms to grow faster by grabbing a large amount of resources per time unit but renders the process of atp production very inefficient pfeiffer et al 2001 litchman et al 2015 the tradeoff between the acquisition of different resources is one of the major tradeoffs found in nature tilman 1982 1990 these tradeoffs are mainly settled on the fact that cells have a limited surface that can be committed to the uptake of a given nutrient or even its limited cell volume to hold the cellular machinery to process different resources on the other hand the tradeoff between rate and yield can be derived using thermodynamical arguments maclean 2008 exposes this argument in a particularly clear and intuitive way arguing that the reaction rate is proportional to the difference of gibbs free energy of the products and the substrate if all the energy of the reaction is conserved in the form of atp then the free energy difference is null and the reaction rate approaches zero as less energy is conserved as atp the yield of the reaction decreases but the reaction accelerates the rate increases since glycolysis is a complex multistep reaction a more detailed study such as heinrich et al 1997 can be done concerning the phases where it is more favorable to invest energy in order to optimize the reaction in this way we assume that the uptake rates of resources r 1 and r 2 namely a 1 and a 2 are related with each other through the relation 4 a 2 a max 1 a 1 a max γ uptake where a max corresponds to the maximum uptake rate that can be achieved likewise the tradeoff between efficiency and uptake rate for a given resource r k is described by 5 a k a max 1 η k γ yield note that the maximum efficiency is one and so there is no need to rescale η when the exponent γ 1 the tradeoff is depicted by a concave function while in the range 0 γ 1 the tradeoff curve is convex see fig 2 as there exist two nutrients types we end up with three tradeoff relationships one relating a 2 to a 1 and the two remaining ones sketching the tradeoff between the resource uptake rates a k and their corresponding efficiencies η k k 1 2 in the illustration fig 2 γ yield 0 5 and two situations are exemplified for the tradeoff between a 2 and a 1 γ uptake 0 5 convex curve and γ uptake 2 concave curve considering only the tradeoff between uptake rates the former situation favors the appearance of specialists i e individuals cannot concomitantly achieve considerably high uptake rates for both nutrients as the benefit of increasing one trait is decreasingly costly on the other hand the latter case favors the appearance and establishment of generalists as it is possible to evolve to moderate uptake rates for both resources since that corresponds to a condition of an accelerating costly tradeoff hoyle et al 2008 3 simulation results the model here developed allows us to explore the level of cell specialization achieved in an ecosystem and its dependence on the tradeoff characteristics as well as on environmental factors such as resource availability in order to understand how the interplay among the different tradeoffs drives the evolutionary dynamics of the ecosystem it is necessary to start by probing the simpler case where the different tradeoff types do not coexist and hence quantify the level of specialization under these conditions this will allow us to identify which contribution arises from the tradeoffs individually and what depends on their linkage for that purpose two scenarios are relevant i a tradeoff between the resource uptake rates a 1 a 2 but no tradeoff between the uptake rates and their corresponding efficiencies η k which are kept fixed at η 1 η 2 0 25 ii the tradeoff between a 1 and a 2 is absent though the tradeoffs rate vs yield are operative a k η k this analysis is presented in fig 3 where i is shown in the upper panels while the situation ii is displayed in the lower panels the results depicted in the plot reflect some of the knowledge from classical ecological scenarios hoyle et al 2008 when γ uptake 5 fig 3a that in essence favors the establishment of generalists concave curve specialization is in fact not observed on the other hand for γ uptake 0 2 fig 3b in which some degree of specialization is expected to emerge convex curve one sees that the outcome depends on the influx of resources into the system at small δs the system evolves to a configuration in which the majority of individuals specialize in capturing a single resource as δs is augmented though the degree of specialization is substantially reduced and nearly vanishes for large food supply δs for the situation ii although there is no tradeoff between resource uptake rates a 1 and a 2 a specialization due to the tradeoff between resource uptake rate and yield could indirectly induce a specialization in resource uptake for instance suppose that you achieve high efficiency for resource r 1 and high uptake rate for resource r 2 due to these tradeoffs this would lead to a specialization in uptake of resource r 2 even without a direct tradeoff between the uptake rates a 1 a 2 such outcome is not verified meaning that in the lack of multiple tradeoffs no incidental specialization in resource uptake follows from the tradeoff uptake rate vs yield for the sake of clarity our measurements for the degree of specialization that stems from rate vs yield tradeoff will only account individuals specialized in high yield i e they are a measure of specialization in high efficiency as predicted specialization does not flourish under a concave relationship γ yield 5 fig 3c nonetheless specialization in high yield also does not hold even if the tradeoff relationship is convex as seen for γ yield 0 2 and over a broad range of the resource influx rate fig 3d in this scenario a microscopic analysis of the system at equilibrium reveals that specialization actually occurs in the reverse direction with individuals evolving preferentially to high resource uptake rates nevertheless a sharp increase at the degree of specialization occurs at δs 10 000 at this point resources are so plentiful that individuals are already working on a saturated regime i e they seize the maximum amount of resource they can and an additional advantage arises by shifting the strategy to boost the efficiency of the metabolic pathways this indicates that the primary response of selection comes from the competition for resources and the enhancement of the efficiency of the conversion of resources into energy occurs in a second stage once established the emerging pattern of the evolutionary dynamics under a single type of tradeoff let us now probe the response of the dynamics under the coexistence and connection between tradeoffs as we see in fig 4 the set of tradeoffs the individuals are subject to are described by three relations in our measurements we discern specialization in resource uptake from that in yield the former means that the individual evolved to a situation in which the resource uptake of one of the resource types is reasonably larger than the other one therefore we are explicitly analyzing the single relation a 1 a 2 on the other hand when looking at the levels of specialization in yield we are scrutinizing both relations a 1 η 1 and a 2 η 2 in our metric the level of specialization in yield is defined in the range 0 2 where values between one and two signify that specialization was observed in both relations to some extent the maximum value two corresponds to individuals that achieve total specialization in high yield for both r 1 and r 2 resources before going through the simulation results there is another aspect that deserves special attention depending on the constraints imposed by the tradeoffs it is possible to observe circumstances under which the whole population goes extinct this aspect is explored in fig 5 particularly if the tradeoff a 1 a 2 is characterized by a concave relationship the likelihood of population extinction is greatly enhanced interestingly the extinction probability is greater not at small δs but at intermediate and large δs and it is appreciable when the number of resource locations n loc is not large if the number of resource locations is increased this phenomenon is greatly weakened we see from the plot that already for n loc 1 000 the extinction probability is considerably small or null over the whole range of δs in the spatial model the time response for accessing the resource is dependent on diffusion of the resource through the lattice the observed phenomenon is similar to the tragedy of commons hardin 1968 where initially the individuals keep their reproductive rates high but as the population grows the resources become scarce this problem is enhanced in spatial structures as the time for the resource to become available in a given site can be long the emergence of this tragedy of the commons picture is mainly determined by the shape of the tradeoff between a 1 and a 2 when γ uptake 1 and so the shape of the tradeoff changes to a convex form the likelihood of extinction is greatly reduced even for small n loc in homogeneous populations all the resources are promptly available to the whole population in contrast in spatially structured populations the resources are made available to the whole habitat through diffusion depending on the number of food sources the time that it takes to turn the nutrients available to distant locations of the lattice can be considerably large additionally individuals on the route path work as barriers hampering the access to the resource in fig 6 we investigate how the coupling among distinct tradeoffs can effectively change the composition of the evolving population simulation results are presented for quite distinct scenarios in panel 6a all tradeoffs display concave curvatures with γ uptake γ yield 5 and under these conditions specialization does not develop with these constraints the individuals can keep all traits at moderate values with reduced cost although this can sound beneficial for the individuals at first glance since it can maximize individual growth rate it is known from outcomes shown in fig 5 that these sets of strategies can lead to the tragedy of commons hence driving the population to extinction in the other extreme one has tradeoffs of convex curvatures with γ uptake γ yield 0 2 panel 6b now the levels of specialization can be relatively high especially for small δs though the resource influx rate plays a central role in the dynamics increasing the resource influx rates leads to less specialization essentially at small δs every individual simultaneously specializes in seizing one resource type and increases its efficiency in energy production for the remaining resource this situation can be visualized in fig 7 which shows the spatial distribution of the four trait values a 1 a 2 top panels η 1 and η 2 bottom panels actually the degree of specialization achieved for resource uptake is similar to that reached even if the tradeoff a k η k is absent this outcome promptly induces us to conjecture that the tradeoff in resource uptake a 1 a 2 seems to be indirectly promoting the specialization in high yield as the tradeoff rate vs yield by its own is not enough to select for high efficiencies see fig 3d at the bottom panels of fig 6 one evaluates the emerging patterns under a scenario of opposite curvatures i e for one tradeoff the conditions are friendly to the establishment of specialization whereas generalists are expected to emerge in face of the second tradeoff if considered in isolation in panel 6c results are displayed for γ uptake 5 and γ yield 0 2 which in theory suggests that specialization in resource uptake will not thrive counter intuitively we check that especially for highly diffused resources nearly all individuals get specialized in the uptake of one of the resources whereas a negligible fraction of them specialize in high yield indeed the rate vs efficiency tradeoff works as the driving mechanism towards high values of a k k 1 2 at the expense of their corresponding efficiencies in energy production if one looks at the distribution of the individuals resource uptake rates one notices that specialization in resource uptake is indirectly imposed by the tradeoff between rate and yield data not shown though the evolved a 1 and a 2 are such that one of them is kept sufficiently larger in order to fulfill the condition a i a j r spec in panel d the reversed condition is addressed γ uptake 0 2 and γ yield 5 a quite distinct scenario comes up at small δs nearly every individual specializes in the uptake of one resource while maximizing its efficiency in the process of energy conversion for the other resource however as the supply of resource is enhanced the degree of specialization in the resource uptake decreases while specialization in high yield rises 3 1 loose tradeoffs in the sequel we discuss the situation in which the biophysical constraints that induce the tradeoff relationship between two traits are not so narrow in the sense that the tradeoffs are now expressed not by a single curve but being circumscribed by an area in trait space the realm of allowed trait values is now delimited by two curves outlined by the exponents γ inf and γ sup which we will represent by γ γ inf γ sup the phenotypic changes and trait variations enabled by mutation are less constrained than before as shown in the appendix see fig s1 the loosening of these constraints renders the adaptive system almost insensitive to the environmental variable δs in order to have a microscopic view of the system and its response to the constraints imposed by the tradeoffs fig 8 presents scatter plots of individuals resource uptake rates a 1 a 2 and scatter plots of individuals resource uptake rate a 1 vs efficiency η 1 three scenarios are explored in the lower panels the tradeoffs are characterized by γ 0 2 5 in the middle panels one has opposing concavities with the tradeoff covering a domain of the trait space delimited by γ uptake 0 2 0 5 for the relationship a 1 a 2 whereas γ yield 2 5 for the relationship a k η k and finally in the upper panels one has the situation in which the tradeoff is portrayed by a single curve with γ uptake 0 2 and γ yield 5 i e the tradeoff is strict for the first case lower panels the traits are relatively unconstrained as can be seen the distribution of trait values seems to be unbiased and an almost uniform sweep of the allowed domain in the trait space is accomplished an interesting feature deserves attention as fig s1 see appendix shows the level of specialization under such conditions is not null but close to 0 5 thus we can think of this amount of specialization as the expected level of specialization when trait values are completely uncorrelated and so specialization occurs by chance when the tradeoffs are conflicting but not strict middle panels that is no longer the expected outcome although the distribution of the pairs a 1 a 2 covers almost uniformly the supported domain in the space a 1 a 2 an asymmetry in the plot a 1 vs efficiency η 1 is verified we see that there is a propensity for the individuals to evolve to higher efficiencies in energy production this feature becomes even more pronounced when the tradeoff gets strongly constrained in the upper panels the distribution of resource uptake rates is now more restricted to the range of intermediate values while the efficiencies η 1 are restrained at high values all these aspects are in agreement with the results displayed in fig 6d where the level of specialization in high yield is larger than in resource uptake 3 2 model with random placement the results of the model in the form presented here include effects of kin selection since kin cells tend to accumulate around a given location in order to separate the effects of kin selection from the remaining selective pressures we introduce a variant of the aforementioned model in this modified version it is now assumed that upon reproduction the offspring are not placed in the neighborhood of the parental cell but are instead placed in a random location of the lattice this way we are removing the influence of kinship selection from the dynamics in fig 9 the resulting levels of specialization are plotted for the same set of scenarios as presented in fig 6 comparing the results with those of the original model one notices some dissimilarities the key outcome of the model with random placement relies on the achievement of greater levels of specialization in yield as seen in both situation in which γ uptake 0 2 for instance in the case γ yield 5 0 and γ uptake 0 2 full specialization in high yield is already attained at small resource input whereas in the original model the observed highest level is only settled at very high resource input another remarkable outcome regards the near independence of the specialization levels on resource influx δs 3 3 well mixed populations a second variant of the original model is addressed now here we take a step backwards and propose a well mixed population i e the role of structuring is completely removed from the dynamics as such the resources are now accessible to all individuals simultaneously every generation it is assumed that the resource influx is depleted by the population and those individuals that have enhanced uptake rates seize a larger portion of the food thus the amount of resource captured by individual i is simply 6 j i k δ s k a i k j a j k where δs k is the resource influx rate for resource r k one important aspect of this well mixed population model is that the population size at stationarity is ruled by the evolutionary dynamics itself being strongly affected by the resource influx rates δs metabolic properties of the evolved organisms and the death rate another point to highlight is that in this case there is no space limitation like in section 3 2 the specialization levels are analyzed for the four scenarios studied in figs 6 and 9 the results are presented in fig 10 the most visible feature is that now the evolved levels of specialization are usually considerably smaller in all scenarios but the most drastic reductions occur at the levels of specialization in high yield roughly speaking specialized individuals in high yield are now only found for the set γ uptake 0 2 and γ yield 5 but even though their levels are about two fold smaller than recorded in the spatial models once again like the spatial model with random placement one also observes that the outcomes of the well mixed population model are nearly independent of δs 4 conclusions in this contribution we propose an adaptive approach to investigate the role of tradeoffs in the composition of a population and how this can lead to specialization more importantly we study how the connection between tradeoffs and their shape can affect the evolutionary dynamics the study of tradeoffs and their consequences are an issue of intense debate in the current literature little is known about the influence of tradeoffs in natural populations and communities as even the characterization of tradeoffs is quite troublesome edwards et al 2011 in this context theoretical developments can provide helpful insights into the subject and provide possible evolutionary scenarios that emerge from established relations between traits the issue of specialization has been largely discussed within the context of division of labor most of the investigations are either concerned with the evolution of multicellularity amado et al 2018a b amado and campos 2017 rueffler et al 2012 or are elaborated within the framework of social evolution beshers and fewell 2001 duarte et al 2012 regardless the context in those approaches the target of selection is not the individual but the organism or the group hence it is crucial to understand what are the evolutionary mechanisms that can drive and establish differentiation among the lower level units within the context of evolution of multicellularity division of labor ensues from the assumption that the whole organism must function on optimal conditions amado et al 2018a a fact that is corroborated by empirical observations dekel and alon 2005 division of labor thus permits the multicellular organism to concomitantly undertake several physiological processes simpson 2012 specialization and division of labor in the social context is linked to an increased efficiency and colony fitness gordon 2016 as it may increase individual s task performance and reduce time wasted moving between tasks here we are not concerned about linking specialization to division of labor as all the processes are assumed to occur at the individual level i e there is no transition from a lower level unit to a higher level organism rather the problem is more properly addressed within an evolutionary ecology approach which aims to appreciate how environmental circumstances can change and alter the metabolic properties of the individuals and their responses under the constraints imposed by physiological limitations which are then represented by the tradeoff relationships taking this into consideration some previous results from classical ecological studies hoyle et al 2008 provide the emerging evolutionary dynamics from simpler situations in which single tradeoffs exist according to those works the shape of the tradeoff relationship can determine the population composition for instance if the tradeoff is better characterized by a convex function then there is a propensity to evolve specialization whereas concave curvatures favor the establishment of generalists jessup and bohannan 2008 hoyle et al 2008 these conclusions are our starting points and may help us to unveil the complex patterns that come out whenever more than one tradeoff is involved the presence of multiple tradeoffs that are not independent leads to higher order interactions as most of the recent advances in this field originate from lab experiments in microbial populations aimed to contemplate their adapting metabolic states pfeiffer et al 2001 lavorel and garnier 2002 litchman et al 2015 it sounds natural that a resource based modelling appears as a prompt tool to theoretically scrutinize the intrincate subject matter regarding the interplay of multiple tradeoffs the formulation has the additional advantage of allowing us to probe the influence of environmental factors such as resource availability on the evolutionary dynamics for such purposes we consider that the metabolic properties of the individuals in population are at the mercy of two well documented tradeoffs i between resource uptake rates a 1 a 2 ii between uptake rate and yield which in the case of two resource types provide two additional relations a 1 η 1 for resource r 1 and a 2 η 2 resource r 2 note that by changing for instance a 1 we are concomitantly adjusting a 2 due to the relation a 1 a 2 but also the efficiencies η 1 and η 2 owing to the dependencies provided by the two relations a 1 η 1 and a 2 η 2 several types of tradeoffs and resource influx levels are explored and also the effect of structuring is investigated more specifically one addresses the following scenarios i both exponents are greater than one γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 and thus all the tradeoff relationships are described by concave functions ii the converse situation at which γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 i e all the tradeoff relationships are described by convex functions and finally the situations of opposing tradeoff curvatures iii γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 and iv γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 the former condition γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 exhibits the simplest scenario for single tradeoffs an exponent greater than one favors the appearance of generalists jessup and bohannan 2008 hoyle et al 2008 from our results we observe that this scenario remains unchanged for more than one tradeoff and is not influenced by structuring the second condition γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 if considered isolatedly would endorse specialization in one resource type due to the relation a 1 a 2 and additional specialization stemming from the other two relations a k η k k 1 2 is expected to emerge however from previous investigations we know that in well mixed populations the tradeoff between uptake rate and yield is directed favoring specialization only in resource uptake maclean 2008 amado et al 2016 we checked this prediction for a structured population see fig 3 and the same pattern occurs regardless the level of structuring of the population however when multiple tradeoffs are present the conclusions are modified and one also observes that structuring plays an important role analyzing the well mixed population we see that no specialization evolves at all in fact the relations a k η k k 1 2 seem dominating and as expected from single tradeoffs they favor the evolution of high uptake rates for both resource types and the role of a 1 a 2 is weakened though in the structured models the scenario changes compared to that found for well mixed populations now it is possible to see that under scarcity of food the individuals tend to specialize in the uptake of one resource type while maintaining a high efficiency for the other this is the reason why for small δs we get specialization levels close to one for resource uptake and yield when the resources are abundant the outcome approaches that seen for well mixed populations one important point to highlight is that the enhancement of specialization in structured population is not due to kin selection in fact the random replacement model exhibits higher specialization levels for a wider range of δs therefore the enhancement in specialization may be related to aspects of space limitation and local competition for resource now let us address the situation of opposing curvatures due to the lack of data in the literature for multiple tradeoffs the predictions of the evolutionary outcomes for such cases are much more subtle the condition γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 if analyzed independently would favor the establishment of generalists for resource uptake but the condition γ yield 1 would favor the appearance of specialists either in resource uptake or high yield once again here the role of the relation a 1 a 2 is diminished and the level of specialization in the uptake of resources is found for the whole range of the resource influx rate δs and it is independent of structuring the last condition namely γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 would lead us to predict the presence of specialization in resource uptake but not in high yield if addressed separately the outcomes are quite counterintuitive under scarcity of food small δs individuals tend to specialize in the uptake of one resource and this seems to induce specialization in high yield for the remaining resource though as δs increases the importance of the relation a 1 a 2 weakens and the relations a k η k k 1 2 increase their influence and for the structured models at large δs the specialization levels in high yield approaches 2 meaning that the individuals achieve high efficiencies for both resources on the other hand the augment of the efficiencies leads to a reduction on the uptake rates for both resources and so does the specialization level in resource uptake for well mixed populations specialization levels in high yield are still high but around one meaning that high yield is achieved only for one resource type once again one verifies that kin selection is not promoting specialization in high yield and their levels are indeed higher for almost the range of δs in comparison to the model in which there is a considerable degree of kinship between individuals in the spatial neighborhood in general we can draw the conclusion that the existence of multiple tradeoffs can allow individuals to improve their efficiencies in the process of conversion of resource into energy a phenomenon not seem if selection only operates at the individual level this aspect poses the appearance of the multicellular form of life as a required step for the establishment of efficient metabolic pathways amado et al 2016 therefore the interplay of multiple tradeoffs may provide an alternative mechanism for the evolution of specialization of efficient individuals in energetic terms even in well mixed populations additionally we can say that structuring leads to more specialization in almost all the scenarios but importantly kin selection is not the driving mechanism higher levels of specialization seem to be more related to aspects of space limitation and local diffusion of the resources acknowledgements vmo

fellowship from the program pnpd sponsored by coordenação de aperfeiçoamento de pessoal de nível superior capes we also acknowledge the suggestions of two anonymous reviewers that helped us to improve this contribution appendix a level of specialization loose tradeoffs here we show how the level of specialization evolves when the constraints are relaxed such that the tradeoff is not characterized by a single curve in trait space but instead the traits are allowed to assume values within a broad domain in panel a of fig 11 the tradeoff region in trait space is defined by γ uptake 0 2 0 5 and γ yield 0 2 0 5 comparing with the simulation results presented in fig 6b we see that the levels of specialization are now much less responsive to the resource influx rate δs instead of a sharp drop with δs one now observes that the specialization level for both resource uptake and high yield attains levels around 0 5 at large δs in panel b we have γ uptake 2 5 and γ yield 0 2 0 5 which can be compared with the scenario shown in fig 6c the specialization level slightly decreases with δs and then levels off at intermediate levels note that now a non null specialization level in high yield is found in contrast with the case of strict tradeoffs as addressed in fig 6c in panel 11c once again one discusses a situation of opposing curvatures but now γ uptake 0 2 0 5 and γ yield 2 5 surprisingly it is found that the population evolves to configurations in which the amount of specialized individuals is completely independent of δs with more individuals evolving towards a higher efficiency in energy production in panel 11d the population is now allowed to evolve over a broad domain of the trait space including regions of opposite curvatures in the plot both tradeoffs are defined by γ inf 0 2 and γ sup 5 thus including the curve defined by γ 1 which sets apart the domain of the generalists from the domain of specialists in fact here we have a scenario where the tradeoff is effectively very weak and the individuals are allowed to evolve to a broad spectrum of metabolic strategies similarly the levels of specialization in resource uptake and high yield are roughly the same fluctuating around 0 5 and as before being independent of the influx of resources into the system appendix b simulation procedure our simulation results correspond to averages over a certain number of independent runs for the spatial models the results consist of average values over 1000 replicates for the well mixed population model the data points represent averages over 50 independent runs in general the computational cost of simulating the well mixed population model is considerably higher than observed for the spatial counterparts mainly because in the former the population size is variable and determined by the dynamics itself and not limited by the lattice size as in the spatial model in each run the system evolved for 50 000 generations we have ascertained that this time is more than enough to assure that an equilibrium regime has been reached in all cases one discrete generation consists of the implementation of the processes resource diffusion resource distribution and resource seizing cell death and finally cell division these four stages are implemented in the order indicated in the first stage resource diffusion the resources are diffused over the lattice basically obeying the discretized version of the diffusion equation following this step an additional amount of resource δs is then distributed over the n loc and in the following the dynamics of resource capture by the individuals is implemented as described in the main text section 2 1 1 the captured resources are then converted into energy next the third stage every individual is checked for surviving the removal mechanism which happens at a constant rate ν then those individuals that were not removed are examined whether their energy storage surpass or not the energy threshold e split those individuals whose energy e i j e split divide according to the rules pointed out in section 2 1 2 we would like to emphasize that for the spatial models the n loc food sources are kept in the same location over the replicate in the beginning of the simulations these locations are randomly chosen our codes were developed in c c 
25251,tradeoffs are supposed to play a key role in driving the maintenance and the generation of biodiversity although an extensive literature exists on the effect of single tradeoffs the interplay of simultaneous tradeoffs is not well studied especially from an ecological point of view we propose an adaptive resource based model with tradeoffs at the level of resource acquisition and processing which allows us to assess the level of specialization of populations and how it depends on tradeoff characteristics and environmental conditions furthermore we analyze the effect of structuring on such measurements for such purpose the results of the spatial model are compared to those from the well mixed counterpart as well as to the case in which the influence kin selection is mitigated among our findings we observe that the existence of multiple tradeoffs drives the individuals to higher efficiencies in the process of conversion of resource into energy additionally the results demonstrate that structuring leads to more specialization in almost every scenario surveyed keywords evolutionary theory tradeoff trait adaptation 1 introduction a tradeoff is a functional relationship between two traits which occurs everytime an increase in fitness due to a change in one trait is linked to a detrimental change in a second trait stearns 1989 saeki et al 2014 amado and campos 2017 this gives rise to a negative correlation between these two fitness components tradeoffs have been an issue of intense inquiry in the context of life history theory and are key to the understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics stearns 1989 bell 1980 roff and fairbairn 2007 the most classical example of a tradeoff in life history traits is the one concerning reproductive effort and future survival and reproduction bell 1980 roff and fairbairn 2007 being demonstrated in a huge body of studies reznick 1985 blomquist 2009 tradeoffs are assumed to be a driving mechanism of species diversity patterns in communities kneitel and chase 2004 interspecific tradeoffs play a key role in determining species coexistence in communities especially at small spatial scales thus impacting ecosystem processes tilman 1990 2000 chesson 2000 despite their importance to life history theory there is a historical difficulty in assessing tradeoffs due to the fact that tradeoffs are likely to occur in multiple dimensions edwards et al 2011 for example functional constraints between two fitness related traits may not be seem as a negative trait correlation as it can be masked by strong environmental variation in resource acquisition van noordwijk et al 1986 in this sense the huge body of lab experiments with microbes has provided a unique opportunity for probing the essence of the tradeoffs as well as their influence on spatial structure and dynamics of microbial communities litchman et al 2015 in particular the trait based framework has been developed and employed in lab experiments with microbes to assess community composition and to identify the main mechanisms that rule the fate of those microbial communities litchman and klausmeier 2008 wallenstein and hall 2012 krause et al 2014 most of the recent progress is concerned with their metabolic strategies mainly focusing on surveying how resource acquisition and utilization traits can impact community composition and its feedback to the environment lavorel and garnier 2002 owing to biophysical constraints the species cannot optimize all traits simultaneously and form a superspecies that will drive all other species extinct tilman 1982 growth and efficiency is such an example in fact the energy cost due to additional synthesis of protein devoted to nutrient transportation at the expense of synthesizing others reduces the net yield at which the nutrient is converted into usable energy pfeiffer et al 2001 maclean 2008 wong et al 2009 frank 2010 despite the considerable efforts unleashed in recent years many tradeoffs are still unveiled and undocumented and even not addressed within a theoretical perspective the first step should be to identify the important functional traits hence tradeoffs could be detected by surveying community response to environmental variation edwards et al 2011 litchman et al 2015 the situation can be more subtle as multi dimensional tradeoffs are also observed such as the three way tradeoff between nitrogen and phosphorus competitive abilities and cell size edwards et al 2011 the portrayal of the shape of a tradeoff relationship is also of great value as it can rule out ecological interactions yielding different evolutionary predictions jessup and bohannan 2008 hoyle et al 2008 however due to different ecological feedbacks their implications may depend not only on the tradeoff being considered but also on the ecological scenario hoyle et al 2008 some insights have been gained about how the shape of a tradeoff relationship affects the outcome of the evolutionary dynamics and more precisely how it influences levels of specialization and division of labor within groups colonies this problem has been mostly debated within the context of germ soma specialization and its consequence to the transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms michod et al 2006 leslie et al 2017 gavrilets 2010 amado et al 2018b 2016 these works demonstrate that the curvature of the tradeoffs is key for the within group dynamics with cell specialization and division of labor evolving under convex tradeoffs whereas for concave and linear tradeoffs selection against specialization is quite robust michod et al 2006 in the current work we aim to investigate how environmental conditions such as resource availability can impact the composition and more specifically how it affects the levels of specialization in a given population contrary to previous approaches in which this problem has been mainly discussed within the framework of specialization inside groups and its consequences to the appearance of a higher level of biological organization here the motivation lies on more ecological groundings more importantly here we address how the interplay between multiple tradeoffs can change the predictions from the ones verified under simpler scenarios we will investigate how the coupling among the tradeoffs and their shapes can change evolutionary outcomes and their response to ecological feedbacks in comparison with the known results for single tradeoff situations in our modelling the evolutionary dynamics is driven by resource availability the system is adaptive as it is assumed that through mutation individuals can evolve the resource uptake rates and their corresponding efficiencies in transforming the resources into usable energy in order to explore the system we rely on resource based computer simulations the impact of structuring is also addressed with this intent the results of the spatially structured population model is contrasted to those found for well mixed populations in order to probe and relieve the influence of kinship selection in our outcomes a modified version of the original spatial model is also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model the problem of the coupling among multiple tradeoffs is here addressed within a framework of adaptive resource based modelling as such it is assumed that there exists an inflow of two different resources into the system here denoted as r 1 and r 2 the population consists of organisms that compete for the two resources and the strength of this competition will be primarily determined by the individuals resource uptake rates the individuals with larger resource uptake rates are stronger competitors i e they seize a larger portion of the resources the seized resources are then converted into energy leading to biomass growth as the individual s energy repository attains a threshold value e split the organism undergoes binary fission with each offspring inheriting half of the parent s energy storage individuals are also vulnerable to removal death which takes place at a constant rate ν the system is adaptive as during replication daughter cells can differ from their parents in their metabolic properties the population is spatially structured and so resource diffusion is explicitly considered with resource diluting faster in the direction of larger resource gradients in the following the model will be detailedly described for the sake of simplicity one can think of the organisms as single cell organisms like bacteria 2 1 1 resource uptake and conversion into energy as aforementioned the individuals in the population are provided with two different resources r 1 and r 2 and their abilities in competing for the resources are outlined by the uptake constants a k k 1 2 for the sake of clarity table 1 summarizes the meanings of the parameters the population is distributed over a square lattice of size l l each site of the lattice can be occupied by at most one individual there exists a continuous supply of resource to the system which we denote by δs 1 and δs 2 1 1 we will shorten this to δs quite often since the same influx rate is considered in the simulations for each resource whenever a parameter does not include resource index it can be assumed to be the same for both resources the total influx of resource into the system is distributed over the lattice n loc locations sites are randomly chosen to act as food sources which means that every time step an amount δs k n loc of a given resource is added to each of those locations the choices of the n loc locations occur independently for each resource type and these locations remain in the same place for the duration of each simulation the resources spread out on the lattice through diffusion in the implementation one employs a discretized version of the diffusion equation 1 ds k r t dt d 2 s k r t in which the diffusion parameter d is a constant and s k denotes the amount of the resource type k in position r at time t for each site one collects the information about the amount of each resource type the flow of resource will be larger in the direction of the largest gradient each individual can only seize resources which are available in its location at each time step the amount of resource type k caught by an individual in position i j of the grid is estimated as 2 j i j k a i j k s i j k s i j k a i j k δ t where once again a i j k corresponds to the uptake rate of resource r k pfeiffer et al 2001 note that the above definition is alternative to the classical models based on monod and michaelis menten formulations rockwood 2015 in the above equation we simply look for a function that approaches zero when the amount of resource in a given location is small and saturates when the resource abounds as we address tradeoffs involving resource consumption it is quite important to choose a proper function that does not depend on many parameters instead if one assumed a general michaelis menten form one would have to deal with additional parameters making the approach more cumbersome the factor δt is explicitly included in order to fulfill a consistent dimensional analysis nevertheless we take δt 1 since our simulations are defined in discrete time the next stage corresponds to the conversion of the seized resources into energy the amount of energy assembled in the process depends on the efficiency of the metabolic machinery and may vary between resource types as well as among individuals in the following η i j k stands for the efficiency of the process of conversion of resource k into energy for individual at position i j the increase of the energetic reservoir for the individual in position i j is thus given by 3 δ e i j k j i j k η i j k e max 1 η i j k e min where the sum is taken over the two resource types and e max and e min corresponds to upper and lower bounds of this conversion process if we picture single cell organisms such as bacteria or yeast η denotes the efficiency of their metabolic pathway and as η increases one switches from an inefficient mode of metabolism e g fermentation to an efficient mode e g cellular respiration in such case one can assign e max 36 and e min 2 as for respiration each glucose molecule is converted into 36 atp molecules whereas for the fermentation mode only two atp molecules are obtained from one glucose molecule therefore we expect that the energy increase will be proportional to those quantities although our formulation can be considered in a more general context not only applied to microorganisms e max 36 and e min 2 will be used as reference values in this work we will focus on studying the level of specialization achieved under diverse tradeoff and environmental conditions as a measure of the specialization level in a population we will consider the fraction of individuals for which the ratio between parameters surpasses a certain threshold r spec for the case of specialization in yield we sum the contributions due to each resource resulting in a specialization level that can take values in the range 0 2 as an illustration we will say that an individual is specialized in seizing the resource r 1 if a 1 a 2 r spec and that it is specialized in capturing r 2 if a 2 a 1 r spec if none of these conditions are verified we label the individual as generalist for the purposes of this analysis we take r spec 2 5 the same reasoning applies when the traits under scrutiny are uptake rate and efficiency 2 1 2 reproduction mutation and death the energy storage of each individual increases everytime food is converted into energy in real organisms this energy is used to carry out all the biochemical processes inside the cell hence leading to a biomass increase if we think of unicellular organisms their biomass cannot grow indefinitely but as its volume reaches a critical size controlling mechanisms are triggered and the process of cell division is initiated similarly one assumes that as the energy level of a given individual reaches the critical value e split cell division occurs with daughter cells inheriting half of the parent s energy level at this point the daughter cells are not metabolically identical to their parent but can differ slightly during replication mutations occur and so the uptake rates can be affected the resulting change is considerably small and denoted by δa in the simulations δa is set at δa 0 02 quite small compared to typical values of a k considered in the simulations besides reproducing individuals die at a constant rate ν initially the population is isogenic i e the metabolic properties of any individual are exactly the same the uptake rate a 1 is set at a 1 a max 2 and all other quantities are derived from a 1 using the tradeoff relationships as we deal with structured populations the reproduction process is constrained to include the focal site and its neighborhood for which the von neumann neighborhood is considered fig 1 presents an illustration of the basic processes of the model when a cell divides one of the daughter cells remain in the focal site whereas the remaining one is placed at a randomly chosen empty neighbor site if there is no empty site in its neighborhood the daughter cell randomly replaces one of its neighbors the equilibrium results from the balance between reproduction and death but also from competition arising due to space limitation 2 2 tradeoffs a key feature of the current modelling is that tradeoffs play a relevant role in forging the evolutionary dynamics the model relies on the premise of existence of multiple tradeoffs which rule the relationship between uptake rates and between uptake rates and the efficiencies of their corresponding metabolic pathways those tradeoffs are corroborated by empirical studies especially in microbial communities maclean and gudelj 2006 maclean 2008 pfeiffer et al 2001 litchman et al 2015 a higher uptake rate can allow organisms to grow faster by grabbing a large amount of resources per time unit but renders the process of atp production very inefficient pfeiffer et al 2001 litchman et al 2015 the tradeoff between the acquisition of different resources is one of the major tradeoffs found in nature tilman 1982 1990 these tradeoffs are mainly settled on the fact that cells have a limited surface that can be committed to the uptake of a given nutrient or even its limited cell volume to hold the cellular machinery to process different resources on the other hand the tradeoff between rate and yield can be derived using thermodynamical arguments maclean 2008 exposes this argument in a particularly clear and intuitive way arguing that the reaction rate is proportional to the difference of gibbs free energy of the products and the substrate if all the energy of the reaction is conserved in the form of atp then the free energy difference is null and the reaction rate approaches zero as less energy is conserved as atp the yield of the reaction decreases but the reaction accelerates the rate increases since glycolysis is a complex multistep reaction a more detailed study such as heinrich et al 1997 can be done concerning the phases where it is more favorable to invest energy in order to optimize the reaction in this way we assume that the uptake rates of resources r 1 and r 2 namely a 1 and a 2 are related with each other through the relation 4 a 2 a max 1 a 1 a max γ uptake where a max corresponds to the maximum uptake rate that can be achieved likewise the tradeoff between efficiency and uptake rate for a given resource r k is described by 5 a k a max 1 η k γ yield note that the maximum efficiency is one and so there is no need to rescale η when the exponent γ 1 the tradeoff is depicted by a concave function while in the range 0 γ 1 the tradeoff curve is convex see fig 2 as there exist two nutrients types we end up with three tradeoff relationships one relating a 2 to a 1 and the two remaining ones sketching the tradeoff between the resource uptake rates a k and their corresponding efficiencies η k k 1 2 in the illustration fig 2 γ yield 0 5 and two situations are exemplified for the tradeoff between a 2 and a 1 γ uptake 0 5 convex curve and γ uptake 2 concave curve considering only the tradeoff between uptake rates the former situation favors the appearance of specialists i e individuals cannot concomitantly achieve considerably high uptake rates for both nutrients as the benefit of increasing one trait is decreasingly costly on the other hand the latter case favors the appearance and establishment of generalists as it is possible to evolve to moderate uptake rates for both resources since that corresponds to a condition of an accelerating costly tradeoff hoyle et al 2008 3 simulation results the model here developed allows us to explore the level of cell specialization achieved in an ecosystem and its dependence on the tradeoff characteristics as well as on environmental factors such as resource availability in order to understand how the interplay among the different tradeoffs drives the evolutionary dynamics of the ecosystem it is necessary to start by probing the simpler case where the different tradeoff types do not coexist and hence quantify the level of specialization under these conditions this will allow us to identify which contribution arises from the tradeoffs individually and what depends on their linkage for that purpose two scenarios are relevant i a tradeoff between the resource uptake rates a 1 a 2 but no tradeoff between the uptake rates and their corresponding efficiencies η k which are kept fixed at η 1 η 2 0 25 ii the tradeoff between a 1 and a 2 is absent though the tradeoffs rate vs yield are operative a k η k this analysis is presented in fig 3 where i is shown in the upper panels while the situation ii is displayed in the lower panels the results depicted in the plot reflect some of the knowledge from classical ecological scenarios hoyle et al 2008 when γ uptake 5 fig 3a that in essence favors the establishment of generalists concave curve specialization is in fact not observed on the other hand for γ uptake 0 2 fig 3b in which some degree of specialization is expected to emerge convex curve one sees that the outcome depends on the influx of resources into the system at small δs the system evolves to a configuration in which the majority of individuals specialize in capturing a single resource as δs is augmented though the degree of specialization is substantially reduced and nearly vanishes for large food supply δs for the situation ii although there is no tradeoff between resource uptake rates a 1 and a 2 a specialization due to the tradeoff between resource uptake rate and yield could indirectly induce a specialization in resource uptake for instance suppose that you achieve high efficiency for resource r 1 and high uptake rate for resource r 2 due to these tradeoffs this would lead to a specialization in uptake of resource r 2 even without a direct tradeoff between the uptake rates a 1 a 2 such outcome is not verified meaning that in the lack of multiple tradeoffs no incidental specialization in resource uptake follows from the tradeoff uptake rate vs yield for the sake of clarity our measurements for the degree of specialization that stems from rate vs yield tradeoff will only account individuals specialized in high yield i e they are a measure of specialization in high efficiency as predicted specialization does not flourish under a concave relationship γ yield 5 fig 3c nonetheless specialization in high yield also does not hold even if the tradeoff relationship is convex as seen for γ yield 0 2 and over a broad range of the resource influx rate fig 3d in this scenario a microscopic analysis of the system at equilibrium reveals that specialization actually occurs in the reverse direction with individuals evolving preferentially to high resource uptake rates nevertheless a sharp increase at the degree of specialization occurs at δs 10 000 at this point resources are so plentiful that individuals are already working on a saturated regime i e they seize the maximum amount of resource they can and an additional advantage arises by shifting the strategy to boost the efficiency of the metabolic pathways this indicates that the primary response of selection comes from the competition for resources and the enhancement of the efficiency of the conversion of resources into energy occurs in a second stage once established the emerging pattern of the evolutionary dynamics under a single type of tradeoff let us now probe the response of the dynamics under the coexistence and connection between tradeoffs as we see in fig 4 the set of tradeoffs the individuals are subject to are described by three relations in our measurements we discern specialization in resource uptake from that in yield the former means that the individual evolved to a situation in which the resource uptake of one of the resource types is reasonably larger than the other one therefore we are explicitly analyzing the single relation a 1 a 2 on the other hand when looking at the levels of specialization in yield we are scrutinizing both relations a 1 η 1 and a 2 η 2 in our metric the level of specialization in yield is defined in the range 0 2 where values between one and two signify that specialization was observed in both relations to some extent the maximum value two corresponds to individuals that achieve total specialization in high yield for both r 1 and r 2 resources before going through the simulation results there is another aspect that deserves special attention depending on the constraints imposed by the tradeoffs it is possible to observe circumstances under which the whole population goes extinct this aspect is explored in fig 5 particularly if the tradeoff a 1 a 2 is characterized by a concave relationship the likelihood of population extinction is greatly enhanced interestingly the extinction probability is greater not at small δs but at intermediate and large δs and it is appreciable when the number of resource locations n loc is not large if the number of resource locations is increased this phenomenon is greatly weakened we see from the plot that already for n loc 1 000 the extinction probability is considerably small or null over the whole range of δs in the spatial model the time response for accessing the resource is dependent on diffusion of the resource through the lattice the observed phenomenon is similar to the tragedy of commons hardin 1968 where initially the individuals keep their reproductive rates high but as the population grows the resources become scarce this problem is enhanced in spatial structures as the time for the resource to become available in a given site can be long the emergence of this tragedy of the commons picture is mainly determined by the shape of the tradeoff between a 1 and a 2 when γ uptake 1 and so the shape of the tradeoff changes to a convex form the likelihood of extinction is greatly reduced even for small n loc in homogeneous populations all the resources are promptly available to the whole population in contrast in spatially structured populations the resources are made available to the whole habitat through diffusion depending on the number of food sources the time that it takes to turn the nutrients available to distant locations of the lattice can be considerably large additionally individuals on the route path work as barriers hampering the access to the resource in fig 6 we investigate how the coupling among distinct tradeoffs can effectively change the composition of the evolving population simulation results are presented for quite distinct scenarios in panel 6a all tradeoffs display concave curvatures with γ uptake γ yield 5 and under these conditions specialization does not develop with these constraints the individuals can keep all traits at moderate values with reduced cost although this can sound beneficial for the individuals at first glance since it can maximize individual growth rate it is known from outcomes shown in fig 5 that these sets of strategies can lead to the tragedy of commons hence driving the population to extinction in the other extreme one has tradeoffs of convex curvatures with γ uptake γ yield 0 2 panel 6b now the levels of specialization can be relatively high especially for small δs though the resource influx rate plays a central role in the dynamics increasing the resource influx rates leads to less specialization essentially at small δs every individual simultaneously specializes in seizing one resource type and increases its efficiency in energy production for the remaining resource this situation can be visualized in fig 7 which shows the spatial distribution of the four trait values a 1 a 2 top panels η 1 and η 2 bottom panels actually the degree of specialization achieved for resource uptake is similar to that reached even if the tradeoff a k η k is absent this outcome promptly induces us to conjecture that the tradeoff in resource uptake a 1 a 2 seems to be indirectly promoting the specialization in high yield as the tradeoff rate vs yield by its own is not enough to select for high efficiencies see fig 3d at the bottom panels of fig 6 one evaluates the emerging patterns under a scenario of opposite curvatures i e for one tradeoff the conditions are friendly to the establishment of specialization whereas generalists are expected to emerge in face of the second tradeoff if considered in isolation in panel 6c results are displayed for γ uptake 5 and γ yield 0 2 which in theory suggests that specialization in resource uptake will not thrive counter intuitively we check that especially for highly diffused resources nearly all individuals get specialized in the uptake of one of the resources whereas a negligible fraction of them specialize in high yield indeed the rate vs efficiency tradeoff works as the driving mechanism towards high values of a k k 1 2 at the expense of their corresponding efficiencies in energy production if one looks at the distribution of the individuals resource uptake rates one notices that specialization in resource uptake is indirectly imposed by the tradeoff between rate and yield data not shown though the evolved a 1 and a 2 are such that one of them is kept sufficiently larger in order to fulfill the condition a i a j r spec in panel d the reversed condition is addressed γ uptake 0 2 and γ yield 5 a quite distinct scenario comes up at small δs nearly every individual specializes in the uptake of one resource while maximizing its efficiency in the process of energy conversion for the other resource however as the supply of resource is enhanced the degree of specialization in the resource uptake decreases while specialization in high yield rises 3 1 loose tradeoffs in the sequel we discuss the situation in which the biophysical constraints that induce the tradeoff relationship between two traits are not so narrow in the sense that the tradeoffs are now expressed not by a single curve but being circumscribed by an area in trait space the realm of allowed trait values is now delimited by two curves outlined by the exponents γ inf and γ sup which we will represent by γ γ inf γ sup the phenotypic changes and trait variations enabled by mutation are less constrained than before as shown in the appendix see fig s1 the loosening of these constraints renders the adaptive system almost insensitive to the environmental variable δs in order to have a microscopic view of the system and its response to the constraints imposed by the tradeoffs fig 8 presents scatter plots of individuals resource uptake rates a 1 a 2 and scatter plots of individuals resource uptake rate a 1 vs efficiency η 1 three scenarios are explored in the lower panels the tradeoffs are characterized by γ 0 2 5 in the middle panels one has opposing concavities with the tradeoff covering a domain of the trait space delimited by γ uptake 0 2 0 5 for the relationship a 1 a 2 whereas γ yield 2 5 for the relationship a k η k and finally in the upper panels one has the situation in which the tradeoff is portrayed by a single curve with γ uptake 0 2 and γ yield 5 i e the tradeoff is strict for the first case lower panels the traits are relatively unconstrained as can be seen the distribution of trait values seems to be unbiased and an almost uniform sweep of the allowed domain in the trait space is accomplished an interesting feature deserves attention as fig s1 see appendix shows the level of specialization under such conditions is not null but close to 0 5 thus we can think of this amount of specialization as the expected level of specialization when trait values are completely uncorrelated and so specialization occurs by chance when the tradeoffs are conflicting but not strict middle panels that is no longer the expected outcome although the distribution of the pairs a 1 a 2 covers almost uniformly the supported domain in the space a 1 a 2 an asymmetry in the plot a 1 vs efficiency η 1 is verified we see that there is a propensity for the individuals to evolve to higher efficiencies in energy production this feature becomes even more pronounced when the tradeoff gets strongly constrained in the upper panels the distribution of resource uptake rates is now more restricted to the range of intermediate values while the efficiencies η 1 are restrained at high values all these aspects are in agreement with the results displayed in fig 6d where the level of specialization in high yield is larger than in resource uptake 3 2 model with random placement the results of the model in the form presented here include effects of kin selection since kin cells tend to accumulate around a given location in order to separate the effects of kin selection from the remaining selective pressures we introduce a variant of the aforementioned model in this modified version it is now assumed that upon reproduction the offspring are not placed in the neighborhood of the parental cell but are instead placed in a random location of the lattice this way we are removing the influence of kinship selection from the dynamics in fig 9 the resulting levels of specialization are plotted for the same set of scenarios as presented in fig 6 comparing the results with those of the original model one notices some dissimilarities the key outcome of the model with random placement relies on the achievement of greater levels of specialization in yield as seen in both situation in which γ uptake 0 2 for instance in the case γ yield 5 0 and γ uptake 0 2 full specialization in high yield is already attained at small resource input whereas in the original model the observed highest level is only settled at very high resource input another remarkable outcome regards the near independence of the specialization levels on resource influx δs 3 3 well mixed populations a second variant of the original model is addressed now here we take a step backwards and propose a well mixed population i e the role of structuring is completely removed from the dynamics as such the resources are now accessible to all individuals simultaneously every generation it is assumed that the resource influx is depleted by the population and those individuals that have enhanced uptake rates seize a larger portion of the food thus the amount of resource captured by individual i is simply 6 j i k δ s k a i k j a j k where δs k is the resource influx rate for resource r k one important aspect of this well mixed population model is that the population size at stationarity is ruled by the evolutionary dynamics itself being strongly affected by the resource influx rates δs metabolic properties of the evolved organisms and the death rate another point to highlight is that in this case there is no space limitation like in section 3 2 the specialization levels are analyzed for the four scenarios studied in figs 6 and 9 the results are presented in fig 10 the most visible feature is that now the evolved levels of specialization are usually considerably smaller in all scenarios but the most drastic reductions occur at the levels of specialization in high yield roughly speaking specialized individuals in high yield are now only found for the set γ uptake 0 2 and γ yield 5 but even though their levels are about two fold smaller than recorded in the spatial models once again like the spatial model with random placement one also observes that the outcomes of the well mixed population model are nearly independent of δs 4 conclusions in this contribution we propose an adaptive approach to investigate the role of tradeoffs in the composition of a population and how this can lead to specialization more importantly we study how the connection between tradeoffs and their shape can affect the evolutionary dynamics the study of tradeoffs and their consequences are an issue of intense debate in the current literature little is known about the influence of tradeoffs in natural populations and communities as even the characterization of tradeoffs is quite troublesome edwards et al 2011 in this context theoretical developments can provide helpful insights into the subject and provide possible evolutionary scenarios that emerge from established relations between traits the issue of specialization has been largely discussed within the context of division of labor most of the investigations are either concerned with the evolution of multicellularity amado et al 2018a b amado and campos 2017 rueffler et al 2012 or are elaborated within the framework of social evolution beshers and fewell 2001 duarte et al 2012 regardless the context in those approaches the target of selection is not the individual but the organism or the group hence it is crucial to understand what are the evolutionary mechanisms that can drive and establish differentiation among the lower level units within the context of evolution of multicellularity division of labor ensues from the assumption that the whole organism must function on optimal conditions amado et al 2018a a fact that is corroborated by empirical observations dekel and alon 2005 division of labor thus permits the multicellular organism to concomitantly undertake several physiological processes simpson 2012 specialization and division of labor in the social context is linked to an increased efficiency and colony fitness gordon 2016 as it may increase individual s task performance and reduce time wasted moving between tasks here we are not concerned about linking specialization to division of labor as all the processes are assumed to occur at the individual level i e there is no transition from a lower level unit to a higher level organism rather the problem is more properly addressed within an evolutionary ecology approach which aims to appreciate how environmental circumstances can change and alter the metabolic properties of the individuals and their responses under the constraints imposed by physiological limitations which are then represented by the tradeoff relationships taking this into consideration some previous results from classical ecological studies hoyle et al 2008 provide the emerging evolutionary dynamics from simpler situations in which single tradeoffs exist according to those works the shape of the tradeoff relationship can determine the population composition for instance if the tradeoff is better characterized by a convex function then there is a propensity to evolve specialization whereas concave curvatures favor the establishment of generalists jessup and bohannan 2008 hoyle et al 2008 these conclusions are our starting points and may help us to unveil the complex patterns that come out whenever more than one tradeoff is involved the presence of multiple tradeoffs that are not independent leads to higher order interactions as most of the recent advances in this field originate from lab experiments in microbial populations aimed to contemplate their adapting metabolic states pfeiffer et al 2001 lavorel and garnier 2002 litchman et al 2015 it sounds natural that a resource based modelling appears as a prompt tool to theoretically scrutinize the intrincate subject matter regarding the interplay of multiple tradeoffs the formulation has the additional advantage of allowing us to probe the influence of environmental factors such as resource availability on the evolutionary dynamics for such purposes we consider that the metabolic properties of the individuals in population are at the mercy of two well documented tradeoffs i between resource uptake rates a 1 a 2 ii between uptake rate and yield which in the case of two resource types provide two additional relations a 1 η 1 for resource r 1 and a 2 η 2 resource r 2 note that by changing for instance a 1 we are concomitantly adjusting a 2 due to the relation a 1 a 2 but also the efficiencies η 1 and η 2 owing to the dependencies provided by the two relations a 1 η 1 and a 2 η 2 several types of tradeoffs and resource influx levels are explored and also the effect of structuring is investigated more specifically one addresses the following scenarios i both exponents are greater than one γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 and thus all the tradeoff relationships are described by concave functions ii the converse situation at which γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 i e all the tradeoff relationships are described by convex functions and finally the situations of opposing tradeoff curvatures iii γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 and iv γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 the former condition γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 exhibits the simplest scenario for single tradeoffs an exponent greater than one favors the appearance of generalists jessup and bohannan 2008 hoyle et al 2008 from our results we observe that this scenario remains unchanged for more than one tradeoff and is not influenced by structuring the second condition γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 if considered isolatedly would endorse specialization in one resource type due to the relation a 1 a 2 and additional specialization stemming from the other two relations a k η k k 1 2 is expected to emerge however from previous investigations we know that in well mixed populations the tradeoff between uptake rate and yield is directed favoring specialization only in resource uptake maclean 2008 amado et al 2016 we checked this prediction for a structured population see fig 3 and the same pattern occurs regardless the level of structuring of the population however when multiple tradeoffs are present the conclusions are modified and one also observes that structuring plays an important role analyzing the well mixed population we see that no specialization evolves at all in fact the relations a k η k k 1 2 seem dominating and as expected from single tradeoffs they favor the evolution of high uptake rates for both resource types and the role of a 1 a 2 is weakened though in the structured models the scenario changes compared to that found for well mixed populations now it is possible to see that under scarcity of food the individuals tend to specialize in the uptake of one resource type while maintaining a high efficiency for the other this is the reason why for small δs we get specialization levels close to one for resource uptake and yield when the resources are abundant the outcome approaches that seen for well mixed populations one important point to highlight is that the enhancement of specialization in structured population is not due to kin selection in fact the random replacement model exhibits higher specialization levels for a wider range of δs therefore the enhancement in specialization may be related to aspects of space limitation and local competition for resource now let us address the situation of opposing curvatures due to the lack of data in the literature for multiple tradeoffs the predictions of the evolutionary outcomes for such cases are much more subtle the condition γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 if analyzed independently would favor the establishment of generalists for resource uptake but the condition γ yield 1 would favor the appearance of specialists either in resource uptake or high yield once again here the role of the relation a 1 a 2 is diminished and the level of specialization in the uptake of resources is found for the whole range of the resource influx rate δs and it is independent of structuring the last condition namely γ uptake 1 and γ yield 1 would lead us to predict the presence of specialization in resource uptake but not in high yield if addressed separately the outcomes are quite counterintuitive under scarcity of food small δs individuals tend to specialize in the uptake of one resource and this seems to induce specialization in high yield for the remaining resource though as δs increases the importance of the relation a 1 a 2 weakens and the relations a k η k k 1 2 increase their influence and for the structured models at large δs the specialization levels in high yield approaches 2 meaning that the individuals achieve high efficiencies for both resources on the other hand the augment of the efficiencies leads to a reduction on the uptake rates for both resources and so does the specialization level in resource uptake for well mixed populations specialization levels in high yield are still high but around one meaning that high yield is achieved only for one resource type once again one verifies that kin selection is not promoting specialization in high yield and their levels are indeed higher for almost the range of δs in comparison to the model in which there is a considerable degree of kinship between individuals in the spatial neighborhood in general we can draw the conclusion that the existence of multiple tradeoffs can allow individuals to improve their efficiencies in the process of conversion of resource into energy a phenomenon not seem if selection only operates at the individual level this aspect poses the appearance of the multicellular form of life as a required step for the establishment of efficient metabolic pathways amado et al 2016 therefore the interplay of multiple tradeoffs may provide an alternative mechanism for the evolution of specialization of efficient individuals in energetic terms even in well mixed populations additionally we can say that structuring leads to more specialization in almost all the scenarios but importantly kin selection is not the driving mechanism higher levels of specialization seem to be more related to aspects of space limitation and local diffusion of the resources acknowledgements vmo

this contribution appendix a level of specialization loose tradeoffs here we show how the level of specialization evolves when the constraints are relaxed such that the tradeoff is not characterized by a single curve in trait space but instead the traits are allowed to assume values within a broad domain in panel a of fig 11 the tradeoff region in trait space is defined by γ uptake 0 2 0 5 and γ yield 0 2 0 5 comparing with the simulation results presented in fig 6b we see that the levels of specialization are now much less responsive to the resource influx rate δs instead of a sharp drop with δs one now observes that the specialization level for both resource uptake and high yield attains levels around 0 5 at large δs in panel b we have γ uptake 2 5 and γ yield 0 2 0 5 which can be compared with the scenario shown in fig 6c the specialization level slightly decreases with δs and then levels off at intermediate levels note that now a non null specialization level in high yield is found in contrast with the case of strict tradeoffs as addressed in fig 6c in panel 11c once again one discusses a situation of opposing curvatures but now γ uptake 0 2 0 5 and γ yield 2 5 surprisingly it is found that the population evolves to configurations in which the amount of specialized individuals is completely independent of δs with more individuals evolving towards a higher efficiency in energy production in panel 11d the population is now allowed to evolve over a broad domain of the trait space including regions of opposite curvatures in the plot both tradeoffs are defined by γ inf 0 2 and γ sup 5 thus including the curve defined by γ 1 which sets apart the domain of the generalists from the domain of specialists in fact here we have a scenario where the tradeoff is effectively very weak and the individuals are allowed to evolve to a broad spectrum of metabolic strategies similarly the levels of specialization in resource uptake and high yield are roughly the same fluctuating around 0 5 and as before being independent of the influx of resources into the system appendix b simulation procedure our simulation results correspond to averages over a certain number of independent runs for the spatial models the results consist of average values over 1000 replicates for the well mixed population model the data points represent averages over 50 independent runs in general the computational cost of simulating the well mixed population model is considerably higher than observed for the spatial counterparts mainly because in the former the population size is variable and determined by the dynamics itself and not limited by the lattice size as in the spatial model in each run the system evolved for 50 000 generations we have ascertained that this time is more than enough to assure that an equilibrium regime has been reached in all cases one discrete generation consists of the implementation of the processes resource diffusion resource distribution and resource seizing cell death and finally cell division these four stages are implemented in the order indicated in the first stage resource diffusion the resources are diffused over the lattice basically obeying the discretized version of the diffusion equation following this step an additional amount of resource δs is then distributed over the n loc and in the following the dynamics of resource capture by the individuals is implemented as described in the main text section 2 1 1 the captured resources are then converted into energy next the third stage every individual is checked for surviving the removal mechanism which happens at a constant rate ν then those individuals that were not removed are examined whether their energy storage surpass or not the energy threshold e split those individuals whose energy e i j e split divide according to the rules pointed out in section 2 1 2 we would like to emphasize that for the spatial models the n loc food sources are kept in the same location over the replicate in the beginning of the simulations these locations are randomly chosen our codes were developed in c c

keywords co2 uptake carbon burial carbonate chemistry carbon nutrient oxygen cycles food web benthic pelagic coupling 1 introduction fossil fuel combustion and changes in land use after the industrial revolution have been known to destabilize the carbon equilibrium state between the atmosphere and ocean on a global scale and it is estimated that it will take several millennia to regain equilibrium hoffert et al 1979 the global ocean contains approximately 50 times more carbon than does the atmosphere archer and brovkin 2008 and it is an important sink of atmospheric co2 houghton and intergovernmental panel on climate change houghton 2001 major global carbon reservoirs are comprised of the atmosphere oceans terrestrial biosphere fossil fuels and lithosphere kerogens and

shallow coastal waters comprised of estuaries shallows salt marshes seagrass mangroves and intertidal flats have been included in these past estimations mcleod et al 2011 recently despite their relatively small areal coverage of 0 5 of the global earth unep several studies have focused on exploring the potential of shallow coastal waters as carbon reservoirs stocks and sinks flows due to their dense biological activities alongi et al 2016 chen et al 2013 chmura et al 2003 donato et al 2011 fourqurean et al 2012 frankignoulle et al 1998 kubo et al 2017 kuwae et al 2016 murdiyarso et al 2015 our definition of ocean functions for carbon capture and storage the so called climate mitigation functions of the ocean are those classified into 1 a co2 uptake function 2 a dissolved inorganic carbon dic capture function and 3 a carbon storage function fig 1 the co2 uptake function is absorption of atmospheric co2 into the ocean by an air sea co2 gas exchange physical co2 uptake while the dic capture function is temporally fixing dic as organisms or as caco3 by biological production biological dic capture and the carbon storage function is long term on a geological time scale carbon sequestration deep into the sediment when considering the shallow coastal water as composed of benthic and pelagic systems and focused on captured and stored carbon stocks within the ecosystem the amount of carbon remaining in the system results in the following fluxes flux 1 is the burial of the particulate organic carbon poc comprised of detritus and calcium carbonate caco3 into a sedimentation zone on a geological time scale flux 2 is the air sea co2 gas exchange flux 3 is inflows of poc dissolved organic carbon doc and dic which is comprised of co2 aq h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 from the river and flux 4 is the inflow outflow of poc doc caco3 and dic into the continental shelf or deep sea fig 1 here the effects of the input of dic and doc through groundwater flow and volcanic activity the subtraction of dic and the doc associated with non resident fish are omitted in fig 1 and are also currently excluded from our research objectives if the value of flux 1 burial is higher the geological time scale carbon stock that exists as fossil fuels and caco3 in the shallow coastal system increases if the sum of fluxes 2 3 and 4 is positive the temporal carbon stock in the shallow coastal area increases and conversely it decreases if the sum of the fluxes is negative the flux directly affecting atmospheric co2 is flux 2 and its effect is relatively in the short term in contrast flux 1 affects atmospheric co2 indirectly but long term fluxes 3 and 4 affect fluxes 1 and 2 through the biochemical and physical processes in the shallow coastal ecosystem as for the value of flux 1 burial rates of organic carbon in vegetated shallow coastal waters are exceptionally high exceeding those in the soils of terrestrial forests by 30 to 50 fold duarte et al 2013 globally coastal vegetated habitats and terrestrial forests bury comparable amounts of organic carbon annually despite the extent of coastal marine vegetation being less than 3 of forests although this estimated value has great uncertainty duarte 2017 duarte and cebrian 1996 duarte et al 2005 as for the value of flux 2 some shallow coastal waters are recognized to be net emitters of co2 to the atmosphere through air sea co2 gas exchange borges and abril 2011 cai 2011 chen et al 2013 laruelle et al 2013 however some studies have indicated co2 uptake kone et al 2009 kubo et al 2017 kuwae et al 2016 in terms of flux 3 chen et al 2012 estimated the air sea co2 gas exchange from the head to the mouth of large river estuaries and concluded that the head of the estuary is a strong co2 source while the mouth of the estuary functions as a large co2 sink kuwae et al 2016 also argued that the nutrient load from rivers affects the air sea co2 gas exchange in terms of flux 4 several sources estimate the inflow outflow of doc dic and poc in terms of the carbon stock of shallow coastal areas based on observations or budget models algesten et al 2006 eyre and mckee 2002 kubo et al 2015 mahmud et al 2017 in general estimations of fluxes 1 2 3 4 and shallow coastal carbon stock are derived from the limited observations and statistical analyses on each flux in addition available observational data from particular systems are insufficient to cover the large spatial and temporal variability of carbon cycles furthermore fluxes 1 2 3 4 and the carbon stock of shallow coastal areas are influenced by biological dic capture flux flux 5 in fig 1 and all these factors are the result of interactions between physical and biochemical processes in the shallow coastal ecosystem therefore the ecosystem model describing the physical and biochemical processes i e the ecological connectivity is a powerful tool 1 to understand the spatiotemporal patterns and variability 2 to pursue the key mechanisms and interactions and 3 to predict the ecosystem response to environmental measures in addition the model s representation of the results from the ecological connectivity enables us to reveal the unknown partial processes from the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in fact while taking into account the above advantages of the ecosystem model a number of ecosystem models describing the ocean biogeochemistry and the lower trophic levels of the food web have emerged over the last two decades in a variety of contexts ranging from simulations of batch cultures or mesocosms over the shallow coastal waters to the global ocean aumont et al 2003 butenschoen et al 2016 fasham et al 1990 flynn 2010 geider et al 1997 stock et al 2014 wild allen et al 2010 yool et al 2013 zavatarelli and pinardi 2003 when the ecosystem model is applied to shallow coastal waters with high biological productivity and is used to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluxes 1 5 fig 1 as results of ecological connectivity it is significant for it to satisfy the following requirements simultaneously i coupling the benthic and pelagic ecosystems to demonstrate the series of processes in which carbon is captured in water or sediment surfaces and is stored in deeper sediments ii describing the food web of detritus phytoplankton zooplankton and benthic fauna to estimate the carbon capture function associated with grazing at the trophic level iii incorporating the carbonic chemistry theory among dic total alkalinity ph and partial pressure of co2 pco2 while describing detailed

production to demonstrate the effects of hypoxia on a benthic fauna its mortality processes which affects the biological dic capture functions and b bacterial processes such as the oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization and re oxidation of the oxygen demand unit odu comprised of mn2 fe2 and s2 soetaert et al 1996 which affect the alkalinity production consumption vi integration with the hydrodynamic model to estimate the carbon transport in the estuary and at the offshore boundary most of the ecosystem models treating the coupling of the benthic and pelagic ecosystems were produced with an emphasis on studying eutrophication cerco et al 2006 fennel et al 2011 lancelot et al 2005 meire et al 2013 reed et al 2011 soetaert et al 2001 soetaert and middelburg 2009 yakushev et al 2017 the biochemical processes considered in these models are mainly the bacterial biogeochemical processes due to their focus on deoxygenation and redox biogeochemistry at the sediment and sediment water interface thus they treat vertical micro profiles of biochemical processes and do not treat the benthic fauna explicitly as for the food web modeling currently one of the most well known and established coupled models is the european regional seas ecosystem ersem model which demonstrates c n o p si fe coupled cycles and the food web including benthic fauna butenschoen et al 2016 as for the carbonate chemistry biochemical processes can lead to either an increase or decrease of both dic and alkalinity soetaert et al 2007 wolf gladrow et al 2007 and there exist various treatment methods especially for alkalinity production consumption for example the bottom redox model brom yakushev et al 2017 and the dream ocean global research integration model dongri sohma et al 2005 treat the total alkalinity as a model variable and calculate the increase and decrease of alkalinity due to the oxidization reduction linked to biogeochemical processes ersem treats the nutrient concentration effect on the alkalinity artioli et al 2012 the model emagin b c ver 1 0 the ecosystem model for aquatic geologic integrated network for blue carbon introduced herein is unique in that it simultaneously meets all the requirements in items i to vi the objectives of emagin b c are to demonstrate the spatiotemporal dynamics of flux 1 the burial of poc and caco3 flux 2 the air sea co2

pelagic systems and 3 the formation dissolution of caco3 as a result emagin b c represents mechanistically the dynamics of carbon capture and storage functions in the shallow coastal area as a result of the linkage among the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system the food web system and the carbonate chemistry system emagin b c is composed of two models a hydrodynamic model and an ecological model the analysis flow of emagin b c and the forcing factors of the hydrodynamic and ecological models are illustrated in fig 2 through coupling with the hydrodynamic model emagin b c can estimate the carbon transport within the estuary and at the offshore boundary of the estuary 2 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model simulates the three dimensional physical field in the pelagic system of the estuary and demonstrates long term variability of the flow field salt and heat transport the driving forces of the flow field considered in the model are tidal forces surface winds and the local density gradient with realistic coastal topography and bathymetry an overview of the model is shown in appendix f more details on the hydrodynamic model are well described by nakata et al 1983a 1983b and sohma et al 2008 the target area is a mesoscale estuary 1 100 km2 defined as a semi enclosed shallow coastal water body where seawater mingles with freshwater from rivers pritchard 1967 2 2 ecological model the ecological model is a system of equations that establishes the components governing the dynamics of the coastal carbon stock and its related environmental phenomena as model variables the model describes the interaction among model variables as the transformations that c n p ca and o2 undergo as the result of biochemical processes while considering the physical transport the dynamics and spatial distribution of the model variables are described by partial differential equations refer to appendix a the equations satisfy the mass conservation of c n p ca and o2 and are comprised of the production and consumption terms of biochemical processes and transport terms triggered by physical processes each path of the c n p ca o coupled cycle as biochemical processes is derived from empirical and experimental formulations the formulations of each biochemical reaction are based on a first order reaction and include a several model variables b environmental variables obtained from prescribed functions and data e g temperature light intensity c biochemical parameters and d universal constants the values of the biochemical processes are calculated and changed at each time step changes in the biochemical processes affect the dynamics and spatial distribution of the model variables and vice versa the ecological model simulates the ecosystem dynamics as the result of this entanglement of various interactions the biochemical processes and model variables treated in emagin b c are described in fig 3 a and b refer to appendix b for details 2 3 biochemical processes we focus on biochemical processes affecting the climate change mitigation function i e physical co2 uptake dic biological capture and carbon storage in fig 1 conceptually it includes three systems a the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system comprised of plankton primary production and bacterial biogeochemical processes b the food web system from planktons to benthic fauna and detritus to benthic fauna and c the carbonate chemistry system among dic which is comprised of co2 i e sum of co2aq and h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 and ph the three systems are linked to each other and govern the climate change mitigation function the conceptual simplified diagram related to the climate change mitigation function comprised of the three systems in the shallow coastal areas are shown in fig 4 the red arrows indicate dic increase decrease mechanisms linked to co2 uptake release and poc burial mainly dominated by the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system and the food web system the blue arrows indicate alkalinity increase decrease mechanisms linked to co2 uptake release and caco3 burial mainly driven by the carbonate chemistry system and the food web system i e shell formation both dic and alkalinity increases decreases result in changes in pco2 and ph millero 1995 pco2 at the ocean surface is the governing element of co2 uptake release at the ocean surface as formulated below 1 f s e p c o 2 w a t e r p c o 2 a i r where fs is the co2 uptake release flux at the ocean surface the net flux of co2 between the air and sea systems μgc cm 2 s 1 e is the gas exchange coefficient μgc cm 2 s 1 μatm 1 and pco2 water and pco2 air are the partial pressures in the surface water and in the atmosphere μatm respectively for e there are several empirical functions such as the function for wind speed wanninkhof and mcgillis 1999 and the function for temperature and salinity sorai and ohsumi 2005 both of which can be selected in the model appendix c the model s descriptions of the three systems are as follows 2 3 1 carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system the photosynthetic and biogeochemical processes connecting phytoplankton zooplankton detritus dissolved organic matter dom nutrients nh4 n no3 n po4 p dissolved oxygen are the same as in emagin e h sohma et al 2008 the processes are formulated based on a first order reaction formula multiplied by functions of 1 the nonlinear or linear reactions that represent the limitations of light intensity in photosynthesis and the limitations or inhibitions of model variables e g nutrient limitation in photosynthesis oxygen limitation in oxic mineralization and nitrification and 2 the response to temperature the formulations are described in tables b6 and b7 in appendix b 2 3 2 food web system the benthic fauna is divided into suspension feeders and deposit feeders in the model suspension feeders feed on particulate organic matter i e phytoplankton zooplankton detritus and dom while deposit feeders feed on detritus and dom in the benthic system the parts of the feeding phytoplankton zooplankton detritus dom are assimilated as the feeders biomass the mortality of benthic fauna due to hypoxia were considered formulated to estimate the effect of hypoxia on benthic fauna for climate change mitigation table b7 in appendix b 2 3 3 carbonate chemistry system as for the carbonate chemistry system inorganic carbonate chemistry and partial pressure physics are well understood and can be reproduced with fair accuracy even in a simple carbonate chemistry theory that considers the chemical relations among dic which is comprised of co2 hco3 and co3 2 talk pco2 and ph to be at chemical equilibrium hoffert et al 1979 millero 1995 dickson 1981 1990 dickson et al 2007 mehrbach et al 1973 at each time step of calculation emagin b c first calculates the production consumption of dic i e the sum of co2 hco3 and co3 2 and talk due to biochemical processes treated in the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system as well as due to caco3 formation dissolution by using the stoichiometric relations shown in table 1 then pco2 and ph are solved from dic and talk through the theory of inorganic carbonate chemistry using chemical equilibrium constants among co2 hco3 and co3 2 here the chemical equilibrium constants are given as empirical functions of ambient temperature and salinity e g weiss 1974 dickson and goyet 1994 millero 1995 the calcium carbonate formation is considered to be proportional to feeding of benthic fauna suspension feeders and deposit feeders and the calcium carbonate dissolution is formulated based on differences from the concentration of co3 2 calculated at each time step to the saturated concentration of co3 2 the saturated concentration of co3 2 is described as a function of ocean depth broecker and takahashi 1978 the formulations are described in tables b6 and b7 in appendix b all three systems comprise the benthic and pelagic coupled ecosystem and are sensitive to the vertical profiles at the microscale in the benthic system i e dissolved oxygen concentration ratio of oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization nitrification and mn2 fe2 and s2 odu oxidization emagin b c describes the processes in fig 4 via the benthic and pelagic coupled system and describes the vertical micro profiles of the biogeochemical processes in the benthic system 3 implementation emagin b c was applied to tokyo bay and was used to calculate the daily and seasonal dynamics of the average year i e the ecological dynamics in a year long period called the annual periodical steady state of the existing tokyo bay the implementation method is almost identical to that in sohma et al 2008 therefore we summarize the explanation here and discuss the new components of the implementation the prescribed functions forcing functions of the hydrodynamic and ecological models i e freshwater nutrients and carbon input from rivers meteorological conditions e g light intensity wind and open boundary conditions of model variables were set as one year periodic functions based on data observed from 1998 to 2002 the convergence state of this simulation describes the dynamics in a one year period the horizontal spatial resolution for the simulation is different from those in the hydrodynamic and ecological models in the hydrodynamic model a 2 2 km grid was implemented whereas in the ecological model the tokyo bay area under consideration was divided into 26 zones boxes fig 5 the input data for the ecological model from the hydrodynamic model e g flow velocity eddy viscosity and temperature were averaged spatially and adjusted to the 26 boxes of the ecological model while respecting the flow continuity equation of water volume the vertical grid interval in the benthic system was set to 0 1 12 mm and the vertical spatial resolution in the pelagic system was set at 1 2 m furthermore the time step was set at 0 2 h enabling the demonstration of both daily and seasonal dynamics for the biochemical and physical parameters values were set within range of or at the same order as the field experimental data or the data used in other models the parameter values set in this study are listed in appendix d 4 validation the model was validated by confirming the reproducibility of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ecosystem through a comparison between the observed data and the model outputs the outputs are the result of the self sustained ecological connectivity among biochemical physical processes in the benthic and pelagic systems therefore reproduction with all model variables is difficult however if it succeeds it will be strong evidence that the model closely approximates the real ecosystem and its mechanisms samples of the seasonal dynamics of the model outputs concerned with the carbonate chemistry system i e dic talk pco2 and ph are shown in fig 6 in the zones where observed data exist the data are plotted in fig 4 simultaneously in addition pearson s correlation coefficient r between the observed and calculated values the p values p and the sample number n of the observed data are shown in table 2 as shown in fig 6 and table 2 the model has been mostly successful in reproducing the observed values in the model variables with carbonate chemistry except for the ph of the bottom layer at i j 3 5 whose correlation coefficient r is 0 17 p 0 463 and whose p value is the highest among the variables however except for the data on 1 august 1 september and 3 september the correlation coefficient of the ph of the bottom layer is 0 62 p 0 008 and its reliability increases the reproducibility of the seasonal variations daily variations and spatial distributions of the model variables e g phytoplankton detritus dom nutrients dissolved oxygen benthic algae and benthic fauna concerned with the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system and the food web system is at the same level as that of the carbonate chemistry system i e dic pco2 and ph refer to appendix e 5 sample of the model output carbon budget in tokyo bay in this section the model results of the annual average of the carbon budget including co2 physical uptake dic biological capture and the carbon storage functions in tokyo bay are introduced as output examples using the validated emagin b c in fig 7 left the carbon cycle for all of tokyo bay the entire calculation area in fig 5 in spring may summer august autumn november and winter february are shown fig 7 right shows the vertical profile of the dic production consumption due to biochemical processes and the air sea co2 gas exchange physical co2 uptake flux in fig 1 and the burial flux into deeper sediment carbon storage flux in fig 1 at zone ij 5 4 table 3 shows the breakdown of biochemical and physical fluxes which summarizes the fluxes described in fig 7 left as for the physical co2 uptake flux and the carbon storage flux fig 7 right shows that the carbon storage flux remains mostly stable in all seasons in contrast the physical co2 uptake flux varies by about eight 0 252 0 035 times depending on the season this is because the carbon storage flux is largely dominated by the burial of refractory detritus and caco3 that were accumulated in deeper sediments over the past 10 to 100 year timescale therefore daily fluctuations in the pelagic ecosystem or climatic conditions have lower impacts on the burial flux compared to the air sea co2 gas exchange for the biochemical process fig 7 left shows that biological dic capture flux i e the net biological production from dic to organisms and caco3 is highest in spring and lowest negative value in winter in addition fig 7 right shows that dic production occurs mainly at the sediment or sediment water interface and the dic production is derived from the mineralization of the benthic detritus and respiration of benthic fauna from the viewpoint of the vertical integral value at zone i j 5 4 dic consumption is larger than dic production biochemically in the spring and summer seasons incidentally in the model the shell formation of caco3 is mainly due to the growth of bivalves suspension feeders in shallow areas as for the carbon inflows of river origins and the carbon outflows offshore of tokyo bay the carbon flowing into tokyo bay through rivers is largest in the summer concerning the amount of carbon transported outside of tokyo bay at the offshore boundary the total amount of organic carbon poc and doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic carried away is also largest in the summer however with respect to dic i e flux 4 2 in fig 7 left a larger amount is transported outside the bay in winter and autumn than in summer in addition a minimum amount of dic is transported outside the bay in the spring although the dic inflow from the river in spring is the second largest among all the seasons these results indicate that the summer and spring ecosystems of tokyo bay have a higher biological dic capture function than do autumn and winter during the winter organic carbon poc and doc is brought into tokyo bay this phenomenon results from lower poc and doc concentrations on the inside compared to the outside of tokyo bay which is attributed to the low biological production i e low biological dic capture flux inside tokyo bay previous studies on tokyo bay revealed part of the carbon flow and the amount of benthic organic matter in the entire carbon cycle based on observational data kubo and kanda 2017 ogawa and ogura 1997 sato et al 2006 in addition there have been cases in which the annual average value of the carbon balance has been analyzed by the carbon budget model yanagi et al 1993 however the analysis by emagin b c presented herein quantitatively shows the relationship between the detailed biological chemical physical processes and the resultant seasonal variations in the carbon cycle for the first time fig 8 left shows the annual averaged carbon cycle one year carbon budget throughout the tokyo bay the entire calculation area and fig 8 right shows the vertical profile of the annual averaged dic production consumption biochemically and the air sea co2 gas exchange as well as the burial flux into the deeper sediments at zone i j 5 4 as shown in section 3 since the model simulation calculates an annual cycle steady state that returns to the same model variable values on a one year cycle the sum of carbon inflows outflows between the tokyo bay area and its outside area described by this calculation is zero i e steady state in fig 8 left in the one year carbon budget 96 1 of the total carbon flowing into tokyo bay from the atmosphere and river flows out to the offshore area outside of tokyo bay i e flux 4 flux 2 flux 3 in fig 8 left and 3 9 is stored in deeper sediment layer i e flux 1 flux 2 flux 3 in fig 8 left in addition 81 6 of the dic flowing into the tokyo bay from the atmosphere and river flows out to the offshore area as dic i e flux 4 2 flux 2 flux 3 2 in fig 8 left and 16 6 of the dic flowing into the tokyo bay from the atmosphere and rivers is temporally captured as organic matter and caco3 by biological dic capture flux i e flux 5 flux 2 flux 3 2 these results indicate that tokyo bay captures dic from rivers and co2 from the atmosphere as organic carbon and caco3 in tokyo bay and stores carbon by burial of poc andcaco3 these results suggest that the tokyo bay system could sequester a small percentage of the carbon entering the system when considering a snapshot of the system at a single level this may not sound like much but it is not insignificant however at larger or even global scales or as a result of time either the loss or remediation of tidal flats estuaries could have a non negligible impact on climate change this model has the potential to reveal estimate predict its impact and system mechanisms by 1 analyzing the patterns and variability of the carbon stock and flow described in the model from a more diversified perspective and 2 pursuing the key processes and interactions through sensitivity analysis in addition the model has the potential to be both a communication platform among scientists as well as among scientists and policymakers since the model is based on processes and makes it possible to explain the causes of carbon dynamics the model introduced herein is the basis for these future projects 6 conclusion the final goal of the emagin b c project is to reveal the co2 physical uptake dic biological capture and carbon storage function on the basis of biogeochemical and physical processes and to estimate and predict the climate change mitigation function of all types of shallow coastal ecosystems with high biological productivity as a first step we developed an ecosystem model emagin b c ver 1 0 applicable to eutrophic enclosed urbanized waters with river inflow where many observed data exist and is relatively less complex compared to other high biological productive coastal areas i e mangroves coral reefs and salt marshes emagin b c ver 1 0 is a new model that possesses the features described below for demonstrating the series of processes in which carbon is captured in water or sediment surfaces and is stored into deeper sediments the model is composed of benthic and pelagic ecosystems for estimating the carbon capture function associated with grazing at the trophic level the model describes the food web among detritus phytoplankton zooplankton and benthic fauna for estimating the air sea co2 gas exchange the model incorporates the carbonic chemistry theory among dic total alkalinity ph and pco2 as well as describes alkalinity production consumption through biochemical processes in detail for estimating the primary production affecting the biological dic capture functions the model considers carbon nitrogen phosphorus oxygen calcium coupled cycles for demonstrating a the effect of hypoxia on benthic fauna that affect the biological dic capture functions and b the oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization and re oxidation of the oxygen demand unit odu comprised of mn2 fe2 and s2 soetaert et al 1996 which affect the alkalinity production the model describes the vertical profiles of biochemical processes at the microscale mm scale pitch in the sediments related to oxygen consumption production for estimating the carbon transport in the estuary and at the offshore boundary the model was integrated with the hydrodynamic model emagin b c ver 1 0 was applied to tokyo bay and validated by the reproducibility of the seasonal ecosystem variations with observed and calculated values using the validated model we analyzed the carbon budget including co2 uptake dic capture and the carbon storage functions in tokyo bay obtaining the following results firstly the dynamics of the air sea co2 gas exchange flux changed greatly on a seasonal time scale however the buried carbon flux in deeper sediments was fairly stable secondly in the summer a high amount of dic was transported to tokyo bay from the atmosphere and river and was stored in tokyo bay as organic carbon or calcium carbonate by high biological production activities thirdly in the winter dic consumption due to biological production was low and dic production due to mineralization of organic matter occurred although it was relatively lower than in the summer as a result more dic flowed out to the offshore area than was transported originated from the atmosphere and river finally in terms of the annual carbon budget tokyo bay incorporated inorganic and organic carbon from the river and absorbed co2 from the atmosphere then of the incorporated and absorbed carbon 3 9 was stored in the benthic permanent sedimentary layer and 96 1 was transported to the offshore area of tokyo bay the stored dic as the organic carbon or the calcium carbonate formed by biological productivity was 16 6 of dic from the rivers and air sea co2 gas exchange 81 6 of dic flowing into tokyo bay from the atmosphere and river flowed out to the offshore area this paper highlighted various components of a specific model 1 the model concept clarification of the viewpoint of the model 2 the numerical construction and its linkage with the model concept and 3 the model demonstration applied to tokyo bay to check the model s reliability and the possibility of analyzing patterns and variability that might reveal the processes and interactions for carbon management as shown in this paper emagin b c can be a powerful tool to 1 predict estimate the patterns and variability of co2 uptake dic capture and carbon storage capacity of the estuary 2 understand the processes and interactions that dominate the carbon balance in the estuary and 3 be used for management as the communication platform among scientists and policymakers in efforts made toward climate change mitigation in addition by extending the applied area of the model to other shallow coastal areas mangroves coral reefs salt marshes seagrass beds reef seaweed beds and fjords the climate change mitigation functions of those areas on a global scale would be possible to estimate predict as for tokyo bay we predict future 1 analyses of its patterns and variability from a more diversified perspective of carbon stock and flow 2

field in the pelagic system of the estuary and demonstrates the long term variability of the flow field salt and heat transport the target area of the model is an estuary i e a mesoscale 1 100 km semi

25252,an ecosystem model called the emagin b c ver 1 0 ecosystem model for aquatic geologic integrated network for blue carbon describing the carbon nitrogen phosphorus oxygen calcium cycle was developed to estimate predict carbon capture and storage in estuaries emagin b c analyzes 1 carbon burial wherein carbon is captured biologically in the pelagic and benthic ecosystems and stored in

16 6 of the dic from the atmosphere and river as organic matter by biological processes and 3 9 of the total carbon flowing from the atmosphere and river was stored in the deeper sediment layer keywords co2 uptake carbon burial carbonate chemistry carbon nutrient oxygen cycles food web benthic pelagic coupling 1 introduction fossil fuel combustion and changes in land use after the industrial revolution have been known to destabilize the carbon equilibrium state between the atmosphere and ocean on a global scale and it is estimated that it will take several millennia to regain equilibrium hoffert et al 1979 the global ocean contains approximately 50 times more carbon than does the atmosphere archer and brovkin 2008 and it is an important sink of atmospheric co2 houghton and intergovernmental panel on climate change houghton 2001 major global carbon reservoirs are comprised of the atmosphere oceans terrestrial biosphere fossil fuels and lithosphere kerogens and sedimentary rocks among which the oceans are the second largest reservoir falkowski et al 2000 solomon 2007 mcleod et al 2011 however it is unclear whether the carbon reserved sequestered by the shallow coastal waters comprised of estuaries shallows salt marshes seagrass mangroves and intertidal flats have been included in these past estimations mcleod et al 2011 recently despite their relatively small areal coverage of 0 5 of the global earth unep several studies have focused on exploring the potential of shallow coastal waters as carbon reservoirs stocks and sinks flows due to their dense biological activities alongi et al 2016 chen et al 2013 chmura et al 2003 donato et al 2011 fourqurean et al 2012 frankignoulle et al 1998 kubo et al 2017 kuwae et al 2016 murdiyarso et al 2015 our definition of ocean functions for carbon capture and storage the so called climate mitigation functions of the ocean are those classified into 1 a co2 uptake function 2 a dissolved inorganic carbon dic capture function and 3 a carbon storage function fig 1 the co2 uptake function is absorption of atmospheric co2 into the ocean by an air sea co2 gas exchange physical co2 uptake while the dic capture function is temporally fixing dic as organisms or as caco3 by biological production biological dic capture and the carbon storage function is long term on a geological time scale carbon sequestration deep into the sediment when considering the shallow coastal water as composed of benthic and pelagic systems and focused on captured and stored carbon stocks within the ecosystem the amount of carbon remaining in the system results in the following fluxes flux 1 is the burial of the particulate organic carbon poc comprised of detritus and calcium carbonate caco3 into a sedimentation zone on a geological time scale flux 2 is the air sea co2 gas exchange flux 3 is inflows of poc dissolved organic carbon doc and dic which is comprised of co2 aq h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 from the river and flux 4 is the inflow outflow of poc doc caco3 and dic into the continental shelf or deep sea fig 1 here the effects of the input of dic and doc through groundwater flow and volcanic activity the subtraction of dic and the doc associated with non resident fish are omitted in fig 1 and are also currently excluded from our research objectives if the value of flux 1 burial is higher the geological time scale carbon stock that exists as fossil fuels and caco3 in the shallow coastal system increases if the sum of fluxes 2 3 and 4 is positive the temporal carbon stock in the shallow coastal area increases and conversely it decreases if the sum of the fluxes is negative the flux directly affecting atmospheric co2 is flux 2 and its effect is relatively in the short term in contrast flux 1 affects atmospheric co2 indirectly but long term fluxes 3 and 4 affect fluxes 1 and 2 through the biochemical and physical processes in the shallow coastal ecosystem as for the value of flux 1 burial rates of organic carbon in vegetated shallow coastal waters are exceptionally high exceeding those in the soils of terrestrial forests by 30 to 50 fold duarte et al 2013 globally coastal vegetated habitats and terrestrial forests bury comparable amounts of organic carbon annually despite the extent of coastal marine vegetation being less than 3 of forests although this estimated value has great uncertainty duarte 2017 duarte and cebrian 1996 duarte et al 2005 as for the value of flux 2 some shallow coastal waters are recognized to be net emitters of co2 to the atmosphere through air sea co2 gas exchange borges and abril 2011 cai 2011 chen et al 2013 laruelle et al 2013 however some studies have indicated co2 uptake kone et al 2009 kubo et al 2017 kuwae et al 2016 in terms of flux 3 chen et al 2012 estimated the air sea co2 gas exchange from the head to the mouth of large river estuaries and concluded that the head of the estuary is a strong co2 source while the mouth of the estuary functions as a large co2 sink kuwae et al 2016 also argued that the nutrient load from rivers affects the air sea co2 gas exchange in terms of flux 4 several sources estimate the inflow outflow of doc dic and poc in terms of the carbon stock of shallow coastal areas based on observations or budget models algesten et al 2006 eyre and mckee 2002 kubo et al 2015 mahmud et al 2017 in general estimations of fluxes 1 2 3 4 and shallow coastal carbon stock are derived from the limited observations and statistical analyses on each flux in addition available observational data from particular systems are insufficient to cover the large spatial and temporal variability of carbon cycles furthermore fluxes 1 2 3 4 and the carbon stock of shallow coastal areas are influenced by biological dic capture flux flux 5 in fig 1 and all these factors are the result of interactions between physical and biochemical processes in the shallow coastal ecosystem therefore the ecosystem model describing the physical and biochemical processes i e the ecological connectivity is a powerful tool 1 to understand the spatiotemporal patterns and variability 2 to pursue the key mechanisms and interactions and 3 to predict the ecosystem response to environmental measures in addition the model s representation of the results from the ecological connectivity enables us to reveal the unknown partial processes from the dynamics of the whole ecosystem in fact while taking into account the above advantages of the ecosystem model a number of ecosystem models describing the ocean biogeochemistry and the lower trophic levels of the food web have emerged over the last two decades in a variety of contexts ranging from simulations of batch cultures or mesocosms over the shallow coastal waters to the global ocean aumont et al 2003 butenschoen et al 2016 fasham et al 1990 flynn 2010 geider et al 1997 stock et al 2014 wild allen et al 2010 yool et al 2013 zavatarelli and pinardi 2003 when the ecosystem model is applied to shallow coastal waters with high biological productivity and is used to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluxes 1 5 fig 1 as results of ecological connectivity it is significant for it to satisfy the following requirements simultaneously i coupling the benthic and pelagic ecosystems to demonstrate the series of processes in which carbon is captured in water or sediment surfaces and is stored in deeper sediments ii describing the food web of detritus phytoplankton zooplankton and benthic fauna to estimate the carbon capture function associated with grazing at the trophic level iii incorporating the carbonic chemistry theory among dic total alkalinity ph and partial pressure of co2 pco2 while describing detailed alkalinity production consumption through biochemical processes to estimate the air sea co2 gas exchange iv treating carbon nitrogen phosphorus oxygen calcium coupled cycles to estimate the biological production that affects the biological dic capture functions v describing the vertical profiles of biochemical processes at micro scales mm scale pitch in the sediments related to oxygen consumption production to demonstrate the effects of hypoxia on a benthic fauna its mortality processes which affects the biological dic capture functions and b bacterial processes such as the oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization and re oxidation of the oxygen demand unit odu comprised of mn2 fe2 and s2 soetaert et al 1996 which affect the alkalinity production consumption vi integration with the hydrodynamic model to estimate the carbon transport in the estuary and at the offshore boundary most of the ecosystem models treating the coupling of the benthic and pelagic ecosystems were produced with an emphasis on studying eutrophication cerco et al 2006 fennel et al 2011 lancelot et al 2005 meire et al 2013 reed et al 2011 soetaert et al 2001 soetaert and middelburg 2009 yakushev et al 2017 the biochemical processes considered in these models are mainly the bacterial biogeochemical processes due to their focus on deoxygenation and redox biogeochemistry at the sediment and sediment water interface thus they treat vertical micro profiles of biochemical processes and do not treat the benthic fauna explicitly as for the food web modeling currently one of the most well known and established coupled models is the european regional seas ecosystem ersem model which demonstrates c n o p si fe coupled cycles and the food web including benthic fauna butenschoen et al 2016 as for the carbonate chemistry biochemical processes can lead to either an increase or decrease of both dic and alkalinity soetaert et al 2007 wolf gladrow et al 2007 and there exist various treatment methods especially for alkalinity production consumption for example the bottom redox model brom yakushev et al 2017 and the dream ocean global research integration model dongri sohma et al 2005 treat the total alkalinity as a model variable and calculate the increase and decrease of alkalinity due to the oxidization reduction linked to biogeochemical processes ersem treats the nutrient concentration effect on the alkalinity artioli et al 2012 the model emagin b c ver 1 0 the ecosystem model for aquatic geologic integrated network for blue carbon introduced herein is unique in that it simultaneously meets all the requirements in items i to vi the objectives of emagin b c are to demonstrate the spatiotemporal dynamics of flux 1 the burial of poc and caco3 flux 2 the air sea co2 gas exchange physical co2 uptake flux 3 inflows of poc doc and dic from rivers flux 4 the inflow outflow of poc doc caco3 carbon storage and dic into the continental shelf or deep sea and lastly flux 5 biological production biological dic capture to estimate predict the carbon stock of the estuary the final goal of emagin b c is to reveal the mechanisms interactions of biochemical physical processes linked to carbon stock in various shallow coastal areas such as salt marshes sea grass beds tidal flats mangroves coral reefs and urbanized enclosed estuaries and fjords and to estimate predict their mitigating effects on climate change as a first step emagin b c ver 1 0 was developed and applied to tokyo bay whose coastal type is classified as a eutrophic semi closed estuary with river inflows tokyo bay was chosen because the ecosystem is less complex and comprehensive observed data were present as compared to in other shallow vegetated coastal areas in this paper we introduce the emagin b c ver 1 0 model and validate the model by application to tokyo bay in addition we demonstrate the carbon stock co2 uptake dic capture and carbon storage functions of tokyo bay through an analysis of the carbon cycle mechanisms derived from emagin b c 2 model description emagin b c was developed based on the previous developed ecological connectivity hypoxia model sohma et al 2008 referred to here as emagin e h the ecosystem model for aquatic geologic integrated network for eutrophication and hypoxia which focused on the estimation and prediction of the eutrophication hypoxia

c n p o coupled cycles 4 the description of the benthic vertical micro scale variations of the benthic biogeochemical processes such as the oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization denitrification nitrification and oxidation of odu mn2 fe2 s2 and 5 the interaction between the central bay hypoxic area and tidal flat ecosystems the processes added to emagin b c that did not exist in emagin e h are in the carbonate system including 1 the carbonate chemistry theory among dic total alkalinity talk pco2 and ph 2 dic and talk production consumption due to biochemical processes in the benthic and pelagic systems and 3 the formation dissolution of caco3 as a result emagin b c represents mechanistically the dynamics of carbon capture and storage functions in the shallow coastal area as a result of the linkage among the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system the food web system and the carbonate chemistry system emagin b c is composed of two models a hydrodynamic model and an ecological model the analysis flow of emagin b c and the forcing factors of the hydrodynamic and ecological models are illustrated in fig 2 through coupling with the hydrodynamic model emagin b c can estimate the carbon transport within the estuary and at the offshore boundary of the estuary 2 1 hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model simulates the three dimensional physical field in the pelagic system of the estuary and demonstrates long term variability of the flow field salt and heat transport the driving forces of the flow field considered in the model are tidal forces surface winds and the local density gradient with realistic coastal topography and bathymetry an overview of the model is shown in appendix f more details on the hydrodynamic model are well described by nakata et al 1983a 1983b and sohma et al 2008 the target area is a mesoscale estuary 1 100 km2 defined as a semi enclosed shallow coastal water body where seawater mingles with freshwater from rivers pritchard 1967 2 2 ecological model the ecological model is a system of equations that establishes the components governing the dynamics of the coastal carbon stock and its related environmental phenomena as model variables the model describes the interaction among model variables as the transformations that c n p ca and o2 undergo as the result of biochemical processes while considering the physical transport the dynamics and spatial distribution of the model variables are described by partial differential equations refer to appendix a the equations satisfy the mass conservation of c n p ca and o2 and are comprised of the production and consumption terms of biochemical processes and transport terms triggered by physical processes each path of the c n p ca o coupled cycle as biochemical processes is derived from empirical and experimental formulations the formulations of each biochemical reaction are based on a first order reaction and include a several model variables b environmental variables obtained from prescribed functions and data e g temperature light intensity c biochemical parameters and d universal constants the values of the biochemical processes are calculated and changed at each time step changes in the biochemical processes affect the dynamics and spatial distribution of the model variables and vice versa the ecological model simulates the ecosystem dynamics as the result of this entanglement of various interactions the biochemical processes and model variables treated in emagin b c are described in fig 3 a and b refer to appendix b for details 2 3 biochemical processes we focus on biochemical processes affecting the climate change mitigation function i e physical co2 uptake dic biological capture and carbon storage in fig 1 conceptually it includes three systems a the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system comprised of plankton primary production and bacterial biogeochemical processes b the food web system from planktons to benthic fauna and detritus to benthic fauna and c the carbonate chemistry system among dic which is comprised of co2 i e sum of co2aq and h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 and ph the three systems are linked to each other and govern the climate change mitigation function the conceptual simplified diagram related to the climate change mitigation function comprised of the three systems in the shallow coastal areas are shown in fig 4 the red arrows indicate dic increase decrease mechanisms linked to co2 uptake release and poc burial mainly dominated by the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system and the food web system the blue arrows indicate alkalinity increase decrease mechanisms linked to co2 uptake release and caco3 burial mainly driven by the carbonate chemistry system and the food web system i e shell formation both dic and alkalinity increases decreases result in changes in pco2 and ph millero 1995 pco2 at the ocean surface is the governing element of co2 uptake release at the ocean surface as formulated below 1 f s e p c o 2 w a t e r p c o 2 a i r where fs is the co2 uptake release flux at the ocean surface the net flux of co2 between the air and sea systems μgc cm 2 s 1 e is the gas exchange coefficient μgc cm 2 s 1 μatm 1 and pco2 water and pco2 air are the partial pressures in the surface water and in the atmosphere μatm respectively for e there are several empirical functions such as the function for wind speed wanninkhof and mcgillis 1999 and the function for temperature and salinity sorai and ohsumi 2005 both of which can be selected in the model appendix c the model s descriptions of the three systems are as follows 2 3 1 carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system the photosynthetic and biogeochemical processes connecting phytoplankton zooplankton detritus dissolved organic matter dom nutrients nh4 n no3 n po4 p dissolved oxygen are the same as in emagin e h sohma et al 2008 the processes are formulated based on a first order reaction formula multiplied by functions of 1 the nonlinear or linear reactions that represent the limitations of light intensity in photosynthesis and the limitations or inhibitions of model variables e g nutrient limitation in photosynthesis oxygen limitation in oxic mineralization and nitrification and 2 the response to temperature the formulations are described in tables b6 and b7 in appendix b 2 3 2 food web system the benthic fauna is divided into suspension feeders and deposit feeders in the model suspension feeders feed on particulate organic matter i e phytoplankton zooplankton detritus and dom while deposit feeders feed on detritus and dom in the benthic system the parts of the feeding phytoplankton zooplankton detritus dom are assimilated as the feeders biomass the mortality of benthic fauna due to hypoxia were considered formulated to estimate the effect of hypoxia on benthic fauna for climate change mitigation table b7 in appendix b 2 3 3 carbonate chemistry system as for the carbonate chemistry system inorganic carbonate chemistry and partial pressure physics are well understood and can be reproduced with fair accuracy even in a simple carbonate chemistry theory that considers the chemical relations among dic which is comprised of co2 hco3 and co3 2 talk pco2 and ph to be at chemical equilibrium hoffert et al 1979 millero 1995 dickson 1981 1990 dickson et al 2007 mehrbach et al 1973 at each time step of calculation emagin b c first calculates the production consumption of dic i e the sum of co2 hco3 and co3 2 and talk due to biochemical processes treated in the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system as well as due to caco3 formation dissolution by using the stoichiometric relations shown in table 1 then pco2 and ph are solved from dic and talk through the theory of inorganic carbonate chemistry using chemical equilibrium constants among co2 hco3 and co3 2 here the chemical equilibrium constants are given as empirical functions of ambient temperature and salinity e g weiss 1974 dickson and goyet 1994 millero 1995 the calcium carbonate formation is considered to be proportional to feeding of benthic fauna suspension feeders and deposit feeders and the calcium carbonate dissolution is formulated based on differences from the concentration of co3 2 calculated at each time step to the saturated concentration of co3 2 the saturated concentration of co3 2 is described as a function of ocean depth broecker and takahashi 1978 the formulations are described in tables b6 and b7 in appendix b all three systems comprise the benthic and pelagic coupled ecosystem and are sensitive to the vertical profiles at the microscale in the benthic system i e dissolved oxygen concentration ratio of oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization nitrification and mn2 fe2 and s2 odu oxidization emagin b c describes the processes in fig 4 via the benthic and pelagic coupled system and describes the vertical micro profiles of the biogeochemical processes in the benthic system 3 implementation emagin b c was applied to tokyo bay and was used to calculate the daily and seasonal dynamics of the average year i e the ecological dynamics in a year long period called the annual periodical steady state of the existing tokyo bay the implementation method is almost identical to that in sohma et al 2008 therefore we summarize the explanation here and discuss the new components of the implementation the prescribed functions forcing functions of the hydrodynamic and ecological models i e freshwater nutrients and carbon input from rivers meteorological conditions e g light intensity wind and open boundary conditions of model variables were set as one year periodic functions based on data observed from 1998 to 2002 the convergence state of this simulation describes the dynamics in a one year period the horizontal spatial resolution for the simulation is different from those in the hydrodynamic and ecological models in the hydrodynamic model a 2 2 km grid was implemented whereas in the ecological model the tokyo bay area under consideration was divided into 26 zones boxes fig 5 the input data for the ecological model from the hydrodynamic model e g flow velocity eddy viscosity and temperature were averaged spatially and adjusted to the 26 boxes of the ecological model while respecting the flow continuity equation of water volume the vertical grid interval in the benthic system was set to 0 1 12 mm and the vertical spatial resolution in the pelagic system was set at 1 2 m furthermore the time step was set at 0 2 h enabling the demonstration of both daily and seasonal dynamics for the biochemical and physical parameters values were set within range of or at the same order as the field experimental data or the data used in other models the parameter values set in this study are listed in appendix d 4 validation the model was validated by confirming the reproducibility of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ecosystem through a comparison between the observed data and the model outputs the outputs are the result of the self sustained ecological connectivity among biochemical physical processes in the benthic and pelagic systems therefore reproduction with all model variables is difficult however if it succeeds it will be strong evidence that the model closely approximates the real ecosystem and its mechanisms samples of the seasonal dynamics of the model outputs concerned with the carbonate chemistry system i e dic talk pco2 and ph are shown in fig 6 in the zones where observed data exist the data are plotted in fig 4 simultaneously in addition pearson s correlation coefficient r between the observed and calculated values the p values p and the sample number n of the observed data are shown in table 2 as shown in fig 6 and table 2 the model has been mostly successful in reproducing the observed values in the model variables with carbonate chemistry except for the ph of the bottom layer at i j 3 5 whose correlation coefficient r is 0 17 p 0 463 and whose p value is the highest among the variables however except for the data on 1 august 1 september and 3 september the correlation coefficient of the ph of the bottom layer is 0 62 p 0 008 and its reliability increases the reproducibility of the seasonal variations daily variations and spatial distributions of the model variables e g phytoplankton detritus dom nutrients dissolved oxygen benthic algae and benthic fauna concerned with the carbon nutrients oxygen cycling system and the food web system is at the same level as that of the carbonate chemistry system i e dic pco2 and ph refer to appendix e 5 sample of the model output carbon budget in tokyo bay in this section the model results of the annual average of the carbon budget including co2 physical uptake dic biological capture and the carbon storage functions in tokyo bay are introduced as output examples using the validated emagin b c in fig 7 left the carbon cycle for all of tokyo bay the entire calculation area in fig 5 in spring may summer august autumn november and winter february are shown fig 7 right shows the vertical profile of the dic production consumption due to biochemical processes and the air sea co2 gas exchange physical co2 uptake flux in fig 1 and the burial flux into deeper sediment carbon storage flux in fig 1 at zone ij 5 4 table 3 shows the breakdown of biochemical and physical fluxes which summarizes the fluxes described in fig 7 left as for the physical co2 uptake flux and the carbon storage flux fig 7 right shows that the carbon storage flux remains mostly stable in all seasons in contrast the physical co2 uptake flux varies by about eight 0 252 0 035 times depending on the season this is because the carbon storage flux is largely dominated by the burial of refractory detritus and caco3 that were accumulated in deeper sediments over the past 10 to 100 year timescale therefore daily fluctuations in the pelagic ecosystem or climatic conditions have lower impacts on the burial flux compared to the air sea co2 gas exchange for the biochemical process fig 7 left shows that biological dic capture flux i e the net biological production from dic to organisms and caco3 is highest in spring and lowest negative value in winter in addition fig 7 right shows that dic production occurs mainly at the sediment or sediment water interface and the dic production is derived from the mineralization of the benthic detritus and respiration of benthic fauna from the viewpoint of the vertical integral value at zone i j 5 4 dic consumption is larger than dic production biochemically in the spring and summer seasons incidentally in the model the shell formation of caco3 is mainly due to the growth of bivalves suspension feeders in shallow areas as for the carbon inflows of river origins and the carbon outflows offshore of tokyo bay the carbon flowing into tokyo bay through rivers is largest in the summer concerning the amount of carbon transported outside of tokyo bay at the offshore boundary the total amount of organic carbon poc and doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic carried away is also largest in the summer however with respect to dic i e flux 4 2 in fig 7 left a larger amount is transported outside the bay in winter and autumn than in summer in addition a minimum amount of dic is transported outside the bay in the spring although the dic inflow from the river in spring is the second largest among all the seasons these results indicate that the summer and spring ecosystems of tokyo bay have a higher biological dic capture function than do autumn and winter during the winter organic carbon poc and doc is brought into tokyo bay this phenomenon results from lower poc and doc concentrations on the inside compared to the outside of tokyo bay which is attributed to the low biological production i e low biological dic capture flux inside tokyo bay previous studies on tokyo bay revealed part of the carbon flow and the amount of benthic organic matter in the entire carbon cycle based on observational data kubo and kanda 2017 ogawa and ogura 1997 sato et al 2006 in addition there have been cases in which the annual average value of the carbon balance has been analyzed by the carbon budget model yanagi et al 1993 however the analysis by emagin b c presented herein quantitatively shows the relationship between the detailed biological chemical physical processes and the resultant seasonal variations in the carbon cycle for the first time fig 8 left shows the annual averaged carbon cycle one year carbon budget throughout the tokyo bay the entire calculation area and fig 8 right shows the vertical profile of the annual averaged dic production consumption biochemically and the air sea co2 gas exchange as well as the burial flux into the deeper sediments at zone i j 5 4 as shown in section 3 since the model simulation calculates an annual cycle steady state that returns to the same model variable values on a one year cycle the sum of carbon inflows outflows between the tokyo bay area and its outside area described by this calculation is zero i e steady state in fig 8 left in the one year carbon budget 96 1 of the total carbon flowing into tokyo bay from the atmosphere and river flows out to the offshore area outside of tokyo bay i e flux 4 flux 2 flux 3 in fig 8 left and 3 9 is stored in deeper sediment layer i e flux 1 flux 2 flux 3 in fig 8 left in addition 81 6 of the dic flowing into the tokyo bay from the atmosphere and river flows out to the offshore area as dic i e flux 4 2 flux 2 flux 3 2 in fig 8 left and 16 6 of the dic flowing into the tokyo bay from the atmosphere and rivers is temporally captured as organic matter and caco3 by biological dic capture flux i e flux 5 flux 2 flux 3 2 these results indicate that tokyo bay captures dic from rivers and co2 from the atmosphere as organic carbon and caco3 in tokyo bay and stores carbon by burial of poc andcaco3 these results suggest that the tokyo bay system could sequester a small percentage of the carbon entering the system when considering a snapshot of the system at a single level this may not sound like much but it is not insignificant however at larger or even global scales or as a result of time either the loss or remediation of tidal flats estuaries could have a non negligible impact on climate change this model has the potential to reveal estimate predict its impact and system mechanisms by 1 analyzing the patterns and variability of the carbon stock and flow described in the model from a more diversified perspective and 2 pursuing the key processes and interactions through sensitivity analysis in addition the model has the potential to be both a communication platform among scientists as well as among scientists and policymakers since the model is based on processes and makes it possible to explain the causes of carbon dynamics the model introduced herein is the basis for these future projects 6 conclusion the final goal of the emagin b c project is to reveal the co2 physical uptake dic biological capture and carbon storage function on the basis of biogeochemical and physical processes and to estimate and predict the climate change mitigation function of all types of shallow coastal ecosystems with high biological productivity as a first step we developed an ecosystem model emagin b c ver 1 0 applicable to eutrophic enclosed urbanized waters with river inflow where many observed data exist and is relatively less complex compared to other high biological productive coastal areas i e mangroves coral reefs and salt marshes emagin b c ver 1 0 is a new model that possesses the features described below for demonstrating the series of processes in which carbon is captured in water or sediment surfaces and is stored into deeper sediments the model is composed of benthic and pelagic ecosystems for estimating the carbon capture function associated with grazing at the trophic level the model describes the food web among detritus phytoplankton zooplankton and benthic fauna for estimating the air sea co2 gas exchange the model incorporates the carbonic chemistry theory among dic total alkalinity ph and pco2 as well as describes alkalinity production consumption through biochemical processes in detail for estimating the primary production affecting the biological dic capture functions the model considers carbon nitrogen phosphorus oxygen calcium coupled cycles for demonstrating a the effect of hypoxia on benthic fauna that affect the biological dic capture functions and b the oxic suboxic and anoxic mineralization and re oxidation of the oxygen demand unit odu comprised of mn2 fe2 and s2 soetaert et al 1996 which affect the alkalinity production the model describes the vertical profiles of biochemical processes at the microscale mm scale pitch in the sediments related to oxygen consumption production for estimating the carbon transport in the estuary and at the offshore boundary the model was integrated with the hydrodynamic model emagin b c ver 1 0 was applied to tokyo bay and validated by the reproducibility of the seasonal ecosystem variations with observed and calculated values using the validated model we analyzed the carbon budget including co2 uptake dic capture and the carbon storage functions in tokyo bay obtaining the following results firstly the dynamics of the air sea co2 gas exchange flux changed greatly on a seasonal time scale however the buried carbon flux in deeper sediments was fairly stable secondly in the summer a high amount of dic was transported to tokyo bay from the atmosphere and river and was stored in tokyo bay as organic carbon or calcium carbonate by high biological production activities thirdly in the winter dic consumption due to biological production was low and dic production due to mineralization of organic matter occurred although it was relatively lower than in the summer as a result more dic flowed out to the offshore area than was transported originated from the atmosphere and river finally in terms of the annual carbon budget tokyo bay incorporated inorganic and organic carbon from the river and absorbed co2 from the atmosphere then of the incorporated and absorbed carbon 3 9 was stored in the benthic permanent sedimentary layer and 96 1 was transported to the offshore area of tokyo bay the stored dic as the organic carbon or the calcium carbonate formed by biological productivity was 16 6 of dic from the rivers and air sea co2 gas exchange 81 6 of dic flowing into tokyo bay from the atmosphere and river flowed out to the offshore area this paper highlighted various components of a specific model 1 the model concept clarification of the viewpoint of the model 2 the numerical construction and its linkage with the model concept and 3 the model demonstration applied to tokyo bay to check the model s reliability and the possibility of analyzing patterns and variability that might reveal the processes and interactions for carbon management as shown in this paper emagin b c can be a powerful tool to 1 predict estimate the patterns and variability of co2 uptake dic capture and carbon storage capacity of the estuary 2 understand the processes and interactions that dominate the carbon balance in the estuary and 3 be used for management as the communication platform among scientists and policymakers in efforts made toward climate change mitigation in addition by extending the applied area of the model to other shallow coastal areas mangroves coral reefs salt marshes seagrass beds reef seaweed beds and fjords the climate change mitigation functions of those areas on a global scale would be possible to estimate predict as for tokyo bay we predict future 1 analyses of its patterns and variability from a more diversified perspective of carbon stock and flow 2 sensitivity analyses for pursuing the key processes and interactions and predicting future scenarios and 3 extension of the applied area of the model we also foresee a more extensive model development

field in the pelagic system of the estuary and demonstrates the long term variability of the flow field salt and heat transport the target area of the model is an estuary i e a mesoscale 1 100 km semi

25253,exploring the mechanism of plant species persistence in fragmented landscapes has already become a major issue in spatial ecology most of previous models predicted that habitat loss and fragmentation negatively impact plant species persistence while empirical studies found diverse responses of plant species to habitat fragmentation suggesting that some critical process may be overlooked in these models clonal species has the ability to well explore the resources under habitat fragmentation via clonal integration however responses of such species to habitat fragmentation have rarely been considered especially in the aforementioned models here we developed a pair approximation model by considering clonal integration to explore the underlying mechanism of species diverse responses to habitat fragmentation the persistence of global dispersers i e species with seed reproduction depends on habitat loss not habitat fragmentation whereas the persistence of local dispersers i e species with clonal reproduction or mixed dispersers i e species with both seed and clonal reproduction is influenced by both habitat loss and habitat fragmentation furthermore habitat fragmentation shows diverse effects i e positive neutral or negative effects on the persistence of local dispersers or mixed dispersers via clonal integration our results provide theoretical guidance for species conservation which highlights the crucial role of species ecological traits in response to habitat loss and fragmentation keywords pair approximation model extinction threshold habitat loss habitat fragmentation clonal integration 1 introduction habitat destruction including two extreme forms habitat loss and habitat fragmentation is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss wilcox and murphy 1985 tilman et al 1994 liao et al 2017a b c exploring the underlying mechanism of species persistence under habitat destruction has consequently become a critical topic in biodiversity conservation dytham 1995 fahrig 2003 bruggeman et al 2010 heinrichs et al 2016 habitat loss refers to the reduction of habitat availability and habitat fragmentation reflects the configurational fragmentation of the remaining habitat liao et al 2013a b numerical studies have theoretically investigated the impacts of habitat loss and or habitat fragmentation on plant population dynamics bender et al 1998 hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a 2016a b a critical species extinction threshold of habitat loss was found above which a species cannot persist anymore and it will go extinct bascompte 2003 moreover to maintain species persistence at high levels of habitat fragmentation more suitable habitats are needed and vice versa when suitable habitats are clustered i e low level of habitat fragmentation however contrary to predictions from most of previous modelling some recent studies have found that habitat fragmentation can both negatively and positively affect species survival dufour and buttler 2006 alofs and fowler 2010 fahrig 2017 liao et al 2017c such contradictory findings suggest that some crucial process may be overlooked in previous models in natural condition clonal plant species firstly exploit resources and then redistribute energy or resources between parental genets and ramets through connections such as rhizome and stolon alpert and mooney 1986 wijesinghe and handel 1994 pennings and callaway 2000 such process of reallocation resources is known as clonal integration which allows some ramets to grow on resource low sites to survive by receiving resources from the interconnected ramets that growing on resource rich sites stuefer et al 1994 price and marshall 1999 oborny et al 2000 clonal plant species tend to be better competitors on fragmented landscapes for example comparing with clonal plant species on fragmented landscapes short lived and non clonal plant species went extinct faster since they were more susceptible to habitat loss and isolation lindborg 2007 lindborg and pärtel 2012 therefore we conjecture clonal integration may be one of the important processes that have been ignored in the abovementioned models our previous study found that different reproduction modes of plant species can affect their performances in the lattice habitat by analysing the pair approximation ying et al 2014 here we extend our pair approximation model by taking the process of clonal integration into account then we simulate the responses of different plant species to habitat loss and habitat fragmentation hence habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are expected to influence the persistence of clonal species differently i e positive neutral or negative which greatly depend on their reproduction modes sexual or asexual reproduction as well as the clonal integration 2 method 2 1 model assumptions to simplify a plant species is assumed to grow on an ideal landscape which includes two types of habitats i e suitable and unsuitable denoted as s and u respectively only the s sites are able to be colonized by plants each habitat site only has one status either empty denoted as 0 or occupied by a plant individual denoted as 1 collectively there are four cases considering the types of habitat and the statue of the habitat suitable and empty denoted as s 0 suitable and occupied denoted as s 1 unsuitable and empty denoted as u 0 and unsuitable and occupied denoted as u 1 all individuals are assumed to be genetically identical each individual can propagate by sexual reproduction and or by asexual reproduction where the former mainly refers to seed reproduction with long range dispersal via animals wind or water global dispersal ran 2006 he et al 2009 while the latter reflects that plants reproduce offspring e g rhizome and stolon through clonal growth with distance limited extension local dispersal santamaría 2002 silvertown 2008 in our case clonal plants are assumed to have the ability to randomly propagate in any empty site via sexual reproduction or to the nearest neighboring sites via asexual reproduction each site has a few z nearest neighboring sites in our case z 4 adopting von neumann neighbourship from lohn and reggia 2002 moreover we assume that the offspring reproduced via sexual reproduction can only survive in suitable sites while the offspring reproduced via clonal growth can survive in both suitable and unsuitable sites due to clonal integration 2 2 landscape patterns the landscape pattern in our case is described by using the total density of s sites in the landscape p s and the clumping degree of s sites q s s matsuda et al 1992 the q s s is defined as the probability that the neighbour of an s site is also an s site i e q s s p s s p s where the pair density p s s is the probability that a randomly chosen pair of neighbouring sites are both s sites it is clear that the degree of habitat loss can be described by p u 1 p s i e total density of u sites while the fragmented parameter q u s 1 q s s can be used to describe the habitat fragmentation since the clumping degree of s sites q s s is a measurement of the aggregation of s sites i e the average fragment size the maximum possible degree of habitat fragmentation is constrained by habitat loss hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2017a b c 1 q u s p u 1 p u different values of the parameters p u and q u s can generate various fragmented landscapes hiebeler 2000 2007 fig 1 if p u q u s the unsuitable habitats are randomly distributed in the landscape fig 1a while p u q u s and p u q u s represent the over dispersal i e high fragmented patterns fig 1b and clustered or low fragmented patterns fig 1c and d respectively in the following simulations the dynamic model of clonal plant species on destructive landscapes is investigated for landscapes with varying values of the parameters p u and q u s 2 3 modelling species persistence in fragmented landscapes the dynamics of clonal plant species in fragmented landscapes can be described as 2a d p s 1 d t c 1 q s 1 s 0 c 2 q u 1 s 0 p s 0 c l o n a l r e p r o d u c t i o n s 1 p s 1 s 2 p u 1 p

frequency of s 1 sites and u 1 sites in the whole lattice landscape respectively and other parameters are summarized in table 1 eq 2a describes the dynamic of clonal plants density in the suitable sites p s 1 the density of clonal plants in the suitable habitats is influenced by the ecological processes i e clonal reproduction seed reproduction and mortality the s 0 sites can transfer to s 1 sites via clonal reproduction from its neighboring parental plant in the suitable site c 1 q s 1 s 0 or in the unsuitable site c 2 q u 1 s 0 with local dispersal or via seed reproduction of the clonal plants in the suitable habitat s 1 p s 1 or in the unsuitable habitat s 2 p u 1 with randomly global dispersal the s 1 sites can shift into s 0 sites due to the mortality of clonal plants in the suitable sites eq 2b describes the dynamic of clonal plants density in the unsuitable sites p u 1 only the offspring via clonal reproduction from parental plant in the suitable site can survive in the unsuitable sites due to clonal integration so the u 0 sites can transform to u 1 sites via clonal reproduction from its neighboring parental plant in the suitable site c 1 q s 1 u 0 and the u 1 sites can transfer to u 0 sites via death of clonal plants in the unsuitable sites with the spreading of clonal plants q s 1 s 0 q u 1 s 0 and q s 1 u 0 vary more equations are required for constituting a closed pa system based on the conditions of the variables appendix a seven variables i e p s 1 p u 1 p s 1 s 1 p s 0 s 0 p s 0 u 0 p u 1 u 1 p u 0 u 0 which can express all the other global density p i pair density p i j and local density q i j i j s 1 s 0 u 1 u 0 s u are selected to describe the dynamics of clonal plants in fragmented landscapes the dynamics of these variables are characterized by moment closure in eqs a4a a4g appendix a which constitute a closed pa system describing the dynamics of clonal plants in fragmented landscapes 2 4 system analysis to investigate the effects of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation arising on a given landscape on the species persistence numerical methods are used to derive non trivial solutions for this system to explore the interactive effects of clonal integration and habitat destruction on species persistence we assumed that an equal reproductive rate of clonal reproduction sexual reproduction and an equal mortality rates in the suitable sites and unsuitable sites i e c 1 c 2 c s 1 s 2 s d 1 d 2 d these assumptions are reasonable because ramets of clonal plants share the same energy or resources e g photosynthetic products nutrients and other materials via clonal integration moreover to explore the effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on species extinction thresholds we simulated the dynamic model in the landscape with different p u and q u s under three situations plants only reproduce sexually i e the global dispersers reproduce both sexually and asexually i e the mixed dispersers and reproduce asexually i e the local dispersers 3 results 3 1 plant species with only sexual reproduction i e global dispersers simulations of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation on the persistence of such plants demonstrate that the persistence threshold of global dispersal species under habitat destruction is determined by habitat loss p u and it is irrelevant to habitat fragmentation q u s fig 2 moreover the persistence threshold of species under habitat loss increases with the increasing of reproductive rate s in other words a species with a larger reproductive rate can withstand more habitat loss 3 2 plant species with both sexual and asexual reproduction i e mixed dispersers unlike the findings of plant species with only sexual reproduction both habitat loss and habitat fragmentation affect the persistence threshold of mixed reproduction species fig 3 interestingly when the reproductive rate is relatively small e g c s 0 1 the fragmented habitat allows species to persist in the landscape with a large habitat loss moreover species can persist in clustered habitat i e the black line in fig 3 only when there is a low level of habitat loss i e more suitable habitats these suggest that fragmented habitat stimulates the persistence of mixed dispersal species while clustered habitat hinders the persistence when the reproductive rate is relatively small when the reproductive rate increases e g c s 0 15 fragmented habitat stimulates the persistence of mixed dispersal species while clustered habitat may hinder or stimulates the persistence for mixed dispersal species i e the blue line in fig 3 as the reproductive rate is relatively large e g c s 0 2 0 25 species can persist under a relatively large habitat loss in clustered habitat i e the green and red line in fig 3 3 3 plant species with only asexual reproduction i e local dispersers more complicated results are found in this case the effects of habitat fragmentation on the persistence of species depend on the reproductive rate fig 4 when the reproductive rate is relatively small e g c 0 1 species with only asexual reproduction cannot persist irrespective of habitat loss level no black line in fig 4 when the reproductive rate increases e g c 0 15 surprisingly both clustered habitat and fragmented habitat stimulate the species persistence and more suitable habitat is needed for species persistence when habitat is randomly distributed blue line in fig 4 as the reproductive rate is relatively large e g c 0 2 0 25 more suitable habitats are needed for species persistence in fragmented habitat and less suitable habitats are needed for species persistence in clustered habitat green and red line in fig 4 it means that fragmented habitat hinders the persistence for this type of species and clustered habitat stimulates the persistence when reproductive rate is relatively large 4 discussion clonal integration is a crucial factor to influence plant performances in heterogeneous environments stuefer et al 1994 dong et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 which is a special case of habitat fragmentation however effects of clonal integration have been rarely considered in the theoretical studies on species persistence under habitat loss and habitat fragmentation hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a ying et al 2014 liao et al 2016a b by considering clonal integration we are able to demonstrate how clonal integration modifies the effects of habitat fragmentation on the persistence of species with different reproduction modes i e sexual and asexual reproduction previous theoretical studies showed that habitat loss and habitat fragmentation had a negative effect on species persistence hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a note that the positive effect was also found in this case negative effects of habitat loss are found in our model which is in line with these studies however habitat fragmentation has complex effects on the persistence of species with mixed reproduction and asexual reproduction figs 3 and 4 specifically habitat fragmented hinders and or stimulates the persistence of species the balance of the positive and negative effects determines the species persistence in fragmented landscapes in our model on the one hand the local realized reproduction c q s 0 s 1 of plant species in fragmented habitat is smaller than that in the randomly distributed habitat or clustered habitat since the conditional probability q s 0 s 1 is smaller in fragmented landscape i e negative effect of habitat fragmentation on the other hand fragmented habitat makes more connections between suitable sites and unsuitable sites thus clonal integration increases the exploitation of unsuitable patches and supply seeds or vegetative ramets to suitable patches i e positive effect of habitat fragmentation habitat fragmentation plays an intricate role in species persistence which relies on the reproductive related traits e g reproduction modes reproductive rate the effect of habitat fragmentation shifts from positive to negative with the increasing of reproductive rates figs 3 and 4 due to the locally realized reproduction c q s 0 s 1 caused by habitat fragmentation is expanded or reduced by c times remarkably a small reproductive rate of clonal plants with local dispersal may result in extinction fig 4 this is probably because asexual reproduction leads to a clumped distribution of plant species which reducing the probability of successful establishments of propagules to their suitable and vacant neighboring sites harada and iwasa 1994 1996 ying et al 2014 however such limitation disappears for species with mixed or sexual reproduction because these plant species can avoid the negative effect of their clustered spatial pattern due to global random dispersal with seeds hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013b ying et al 2014 different effects i e positive neutral or negative of habitat fragmentation on species persistence have been observed in different empirical studies fahrig 2002 dufour and buttler 2006 alofs and fowler 2010 fahrig 2017 liao et al 2017a our model shows diverse effects of habitat fragmentation by considering the clonal integration i e the clonal integration modifies the negative effects that is widely approved by previous theoretical studies hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a implying that clonal integration may be an important process for species adapting to habitat fragmentation certainly other factors can also cause a positive effect of habitat fragmentation for example habitat fragmentation could promote species persistence via reducing the intraspecific competition liao et al 2013b or reducing predation pressure liao et al 2017a in conclusion our results demonstrate that clonal integration significantly affects species extinction thresholds in fragmented landscapes which depends on reproduction mode and reproductive rate this study provides a new insight for the effect of habitat fragmentation and consequently provides theoretical guide for species conservation via controlling habitat loss and or habitat fragmentation to maintain the persistence of species with different reproduction modes acknowledgements this research was supported by the science and technology project of jiangxi provincial water resources department no kt201505 yongjie liu holds a research grant

25253,exploring the mechanism of plant species persistence in fragmented landscapes has already become a major issue in spatial ecology most of previous models predicted that habitat loss and fragmentation negatively impact plant species persistence while empirical studies found diverse responses of plant species to habitat fragmentation suggesting that some critical process may be overlooked in these models clonal species has the ability to well explore the resources under habitat fragmentation via clonal integration however responses of such species to habitat fragmentation have rarely been considered especially in the aforementioned models here we developed a pair approximation model by considering clonal integration to explore the underlying mechanism of species diverse responses to habitat fragmentation the persistence of global dispersers i e species with seed reproduction depends on habitat loss not habitat fragmentation whereas the persistence of local dispersers i e species with clonal reproduction or mixed dispersers i e species with both seed and clonal reproduction is influenced by both habitat loss and habitat fragmentation furthermore habitat fragmentation shows diverse effects i e positive neutral or negative effects on the persistence of local dispersers or mixed dispersers via clonal integration our results provide theoretical guidance for species conservation which highlights the crucial role of species ecological traits in response to habitat loss and fragmentation keywords pair approximation model extinction threshold habitat loss habitat fragmentation clonal integration 1 introduction habitat destruction including two extreme forms habitat loss and habitat fragmentation is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss wilcox and murphy 1985 tilman et al 1994 liao et al 2017a b c exploring the underlying mechanism of species persistence under habitat destruction has consequently become a critical topic in biodiversity conservation dytham 1995 fahrig 2003 bruggeman et al 2010 heinrichs et al 2016 habitat loss refers to the reduction of habitat availability and habitat fragmentation reflects the configurational fragmentation of the remaining habitat liao et al 2013a b numerical studies have theoretically investigated the impacts of habitat loss and or habitat fragmentation on plant population dynamics bender et al 1998 hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a 2016a b a critical species extinction threshold of habitat loss was found above which a species cannot persist anymore and it will go extinct bascompte 2003 moreover to maintain species persistence at high levels of habitat fragmentation more suitable habitats are needed and vice versa when suitable habitats are clustered i e low level of habitat fragmentation however contrary to predictions from most of previous modelling some recent studies have found that habitat fragmentation can both negatively and positively affect species survival dufour and buttler 2006 alofs and fowler 2010 fahrig 2017 liao et al 2017c such contradictory findings suggest that some crucial process may be overlooked in previous models in natural condition clonal plant species firstly exploit resources and then redistribute energy or resources between parental genets and ramets through connections such as rhizome and stolon alpert and mooney 1986 wijesinghe and handel 1994 pennings and callaway 2000 such process of reallocation resources is known as clonal integration which allows some ramets to grow on resource low sites to survive by receiving resources from the interconnected ramets that growing on resource rich sites stuefer et al 1994 price and marshall 1999 oborny et al 2000 clonal plant species tend to be better competitors on fragmented landscapes for example comparing with clonal plant species on fragmented landscapes short lived and non clonal plant species went extinct faster since they were more susceptible to habitat loss and isolation lindborg 2007 lindborg and pärtel 2012 therefore we conjecture clonal integration may be one of the important processes that have been ignored in the abovementioned models our previous study found that different reproduction modes of plant species can affect their performances in the lattice habitat by analysing the pair approximation ying et al 2014 here we extend our pair approximation model by taking the process of clonal integration into account then we simulate the responses of different plant species to habitat loss and habitat fragmentation hence habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are expected to influence the persistence of clonal species differently i e positive neutral or negative which greatly depend on their reproduction modes sexual or asexual reproduction as well as the clonal integration 2 method 2 1 model assumptions to simplify a plant species is assumed to grow on an ideal landscape which includes two types of habitats i e suitable and unsuitable denoted as s and u respectively only the s sites are able to be colonized by plants each habitat site only has one status either empty denoted as 0 or occupied by a plant individual denoted as 1 collectively there are four cases considering the types of habitat and the statue of the habitat suitable and empty denoted as s 0 suitable and occupied denoted as s 1 unsuitable and empty denoted as u 0 and unsuitable and occupied denoted as u 1 all individuals are assumed to be genetically identical each individual can propagate by sexual reproduction and or by asexual reproduction where the former mainly refers to seed reproduction with long range dispersal via animals wind or water global dispersal ran 2006 he et al 2009 while the latter reflects that plants reproduce offspring e g rhizome and stolon through clonal growth with distance limited extension local dispersal santamaría 2002 silvertown 2008 in our case clonal plants are assumed to have the ability to randomly propagate in any empty site via sexual reproduction or to the nearest neighboring sites via asexual reproduction each site has a few z nearest neighboring sites in our case z 4 adopting von neumann neighbourship from lohn and reggia 2002 moreover we assume that the offspring reproduced via sexual reproduction can only survive in suitable sites while the offspring reproduced via clonal growth can survive in both suitable and unsuitable sites due to clonal integration 2 2 landscape patterns the landscape pattern in our case is described by using the total density of s sites in the landscape p s and the clumping degree of s sites q s s matsuda et al 1992 the q s s is defined as the probability that the neighbour of an s site is also an s site i e q s s p s s p s where the pair density p s s is the probability that a randomly chosen pair of neighbouring sites are both s sites it is clear that the degree of habitat loss can be described by p u 1 p s i e total density of u sites while the fragmented parameter q u s 1 q s s can be used to describe the habitat fragmentation since the clumping degree of s sites q s s is a measurement of the aggregation of s sites i e the average fragment size the maximum possible degree of habitat fragmentation is constrained by habitat loss hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2017a b c 1 q u s p u 1 p u different values of the parameters p u and q u s can generate various fragmented landscapes hiebeler 2000 2007 fig 1 if p u q u s the unsuitable habitats are randomly distributed in the landscape fig 1a while p u q u s and p u q u s represent the over dispersal i e high fragmented patterns fig 1b and clustered or low fragmented patterns fig 1c and d respectively in the following simulations the dynamic model of clonal plant species on destructive landscapes is investigated for landscapes with varying values of the parameters p u and q u s 2 3 modelling species persistence in fragmented

frequency of s 1 sites and u 1 sites in the whole lattice landscape respectively and other parameters are summarized in table 1 eq 2a describes the dynamic of clonal plants density in the suitable sites p s 1 the density of clonal plants in the suitable habitats is influenced by the ecological processes i e clonal reproduction seed reproduction and mortality the s 0 sites can transfer to s 1 sites via clonal reproduction from its neighboring parental plant in the suitable site c 1 q s 1 s 0 or in the unsuitable site c 2 q u 1 s 0 with local dispersal or via seed reproduction of the clonal plants in the suitable habitat s 1 p s 1 or in the unsuitable habitat s 2 p u 1 with randomly global dispersal the s 1 sites can shift into s 0 sites due to the mortality of clonal plants in the suitable sites eq 2b describes the dynamic of clonal plants density in the unsuitable sites p u 1 only the offspring via clonal reproduction from parental plant in the suitable site can survive in the unsuitable sites due to clonal integration so the u 0 sites can transform to u 1 sites via clonal reproduction from its neighboring parental plant in the suitable site c 1 q s 1 u 0 and the u 1 sites can transfer to u 0 sites via death of clonal plants in the unsuitable sites with the spreading of clonal plants q s 1 s 0 q u 1 s 0 and q s 1 u 0 vary more equations are required for constituting a closed pa system based on the conditions of the variables appendix a seven variables i e p s 1 p u 1 p s 1 s 1 p s 0 s 0 p s 0 u 0 p u 1 u 1 p u 0 u 0 which can express all the other global density p i pair density p i j and local density q i j i j s 1 s 0 u 1 u 0 s u are selected to describe the dynamics of clonal plants in fragmented landscapes the dynamics of these variables are characterized by moment closure in eqs a4a a4g appendix a which constitute a closed pa system describing the dynamics of clonal plants in fragmented landscapes 2 4 system analysis to investigate the effects of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation arising on a given landscape on the species persistence numerical methods are used to derive non trivial solutions for this system to explore the interactive effects of clonal integration and habitat destruction on species persistence we assumed that an equal reproductive rate of clonal reproduction sexual reproduction and an equal mortality rates in the suitable sites and unsuitable sites i e c 1 c 2 c s 1 s 2 s d 1 d 2 d these assumptions are reasonable because ramets of clonal plants share the same energy or resources e g photosynthetic products nutrients and other materials via clonal integration moreover to explore the effect of habitat loss and fragmentation on species extinction thresholds we simulated the dynamic model in the landscape with different p u and q u s under three situations plants only reproduce sexually i e the global dispersers reproduce both sexually and asexually i e the mixed dispersers and reproduce asexually i e the local dispersers 3 results 3 1 plant species with only sexual reproduction i e global dispersers simulations of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation on the persistence of such plants demonstrate that the persistence threshold of global dispersal species under habitat destruction is determined by habitat loss p u and it is irrelevant to habitat fragmentation q u s fig 2 moreover the persistence threshold of species under habitat loss increases with the increasing of reproductive rate s in other words a species with a larger reproductive rate can withstand more habitat loss 3 2 plant species with both sexual and asexual reproduction i e mixed dispersers unlike the findings of plant species with only sexual reproduction both habitat loss and habitat fragmentation affect the persistence threshold of mixed reproduction species fig 3 interestingly when the reproductive rate is relatively small e g c s 0 1 the fragmented habitat allows species to persist in the landscape with a large habitat loss moreover species can persist in clustered habitat i e the black line in fig 3 only when there is a low level of habitat loss i e more suitable habitats these suggest that fragmented habitat stimulates the persistence of mixed dispersal species while clustered habitat hinders the persistence when the reproductive rate is relatively small when the reproductive rate increases e g c s 0 15 fragmented habitat stimulates the persistence of mixed dispersal species while clustered habitat may hinder or stimulates the persistence for mixed dispersal species i e the blue line in fig 3 as the reproductive rate is relatively large e g c s 0 2 0 25 species can persist under a relatively large habitat loss in clustered habitat i e the green and red line in fig 3 3 3 plant species with only asexual reproduction i e local dispersers more complicated results are found in this case the effects of habitat fragmentation on the persistence of species depend on the reproductive rate fig 4 when the reproductive rate is relatively small e g c 0 1 species with only asexual reproduction cannot persist irrespective of habitat loss level no black line in fig 4 when the reproductive rate increases e g c 0 15 surprisingly both clustered habitat and fragmented habitat stimulate the species persistence and more suitable habitat is needed for species persistence when habitat is randomly distributed blue line in fig 4 as the reproductive rate is relatively large e g c 0 2 0 25 more suitable habitats are needed for species persistence in fragmented habitat and less suitable habitats are needed for species persistence in clustered habitat green and red line in fig 4 it means that fragmented habitat hinders the persistence for this type of species and clustered habitat stimulates the persistence when reproductive rate is relatively large 4 discussion clonal integration is a crucial factor to influence plant performances in heterogeneous environments stuefer et al 1994 dong et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 which is a special case of habitat fragmentation however effects of clonal integration have been rarely considered in the theoretical studies on species persistence under habitat loss and habitat fragmentation hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a ying et al 2014 liao et al 2016a b by considering clonal integration we are able to demonstrate how clonal integration modifies the effects of habitat fragmentation on the persistence of species with different reproduction modes i e sexual and asexual reproduction previous theoretical studies showed that habitat loss and habitat fragmentation had a negative effect on species persistence hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a note that the positive effect was also found in this case negative effects of habitat loss are found in our model which is in line with these studies however habitat fragmentation has complex effects on the persistence of species with mixed reproduction and asexual reproduction figs 3 and 4 specifically habitat fragmented hinders and or stimulates the persistence of species the balance of the positive and negative effects determines the species persistence in fragmented landscapes in our model on the one hand the local realized reproduction c q s 0 s 1 of plant species in fragmented habitat is smaller than that in the randomly distributed habitat or clustered habitat since the conditional probability q s 0 s 1 is smaller in fragmented landscape i e negative effect of habitat fragmentation on the other hand fragmented habitat makes more connections between suitable sites and unsuitable sites thus clonal integration increases the exploitation of unsuitable patches and supply seeds or vegetative ramets to suitable patches i e positive effect of habitat fragmentation habitat fragmentation plays an intricate role in species persistence which relies on the reproductive related traits e g reproduction modes reproductive rate the effect of habitat fragmentation shifts from positive to negative with the increasing of reproductive rates figs 3 and 4 due to the locally realized reproduction c q s 0 s 1 caused by habitat fragmentation is expanded or reduced by c times remarkably a small reproductive rate of clonal plants with local dispersal may result in extinction fig 4 this is probably because asexual reproduction leads to a clumped distribution of plant species which reducing the probability of successful establishments of propagules to their suitable and vacant neighboring sites harada and iwasa 1994 1996 ying et al 2014 however such limitation disappears for species with mixed or sexual reproduction because these plant species can avoid the negative effect of their clustered spatial pattern due to global random dispersal with seeds hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013b ying et al 2014 different effects i e positive neutral or negative of habitat fragmentation on species persistence have been observed in different empirical studies fahrig 2002 dufour and buttler 2006 alofs and fowler 2010 fahrig 2017 liao et al 2017a our model shows diverse effects of habitat fragmentation by considering the clonal integration i e the clonal integration modifies the negative effects that is widely approved by previous theoretical studies hiebeler 2000 2007 liao et al 2013a implying that clonal integration may be an important process for species adapting to habitat fragmentation certainly other factors can also cause a positive effect of habitat fragmentation for example habitat fragmentation could promote species persistence via reducing the intraspecific competition liao et al 2013b or reducing predation pressure liao et al 2017a in conclusion our results demonstrate that clonal integration significantly affects species extinction thresholds in fragmented landscapes which depends on reproduction mode and reproductive rate this study provides a new insight for the effect of habitat fragmentation and consequently provides theoretical guide for species conservation via controlling habitat loss and or habitat fragmentation to maintain the persistence of species with different

25254,simulation models have a broad potential as decision support tools for resource management by mechanistically representing and projecting complex ecological processes in the case of socioeconomically and biologically important coral reef ecosystems models have been used to address important questions regarding the effects of human impacts on their ecological dynamics and to inform management approaches however few of the models integrate benthic and fish dynamics with the influence of external anthropogenic stressors and virtually none is available as a user friendly platform for non scientist managers to easily access we propose a new ecological model to assess the effects of simultaneous stressors on coral reef ecosystems which includes a dynamic representation of benthic and fish spatial processes linked by their ecological feedbacks seamancore is a two dimensional model representing the dynamics of local coral reefs which can be used to explore the influence of bleaching eutrophication and fishing including destructive fishing such as bomb and cyanide fishing the model is coupled with a menu based interface that allows users with no programming experience to simulate numerous scenarios in specific contexts that can be customized with depth profile maps and initial coral reef conditions of fish and benthos functional group abundance this study includes seamancore s description and shows the model s sensitivity to its parameters by means of sensitivity analyses its utility is exemplified by exploring various scenarios of no stressors

impacts on coral reefs effective science based management is needed to achieve trade offs where desired ecological states can be maintained while being less taxing on reef dependent human communities

the likely outcomes of management strategies across a range of socio ecological variables building upon earlier models developed to aid local coral reef management e g chang et al 2008 buddemeier et al 2008 holmes and johnstone 2010 weijerman et al 2015 we propose a spatially explicit simulation model for assisting the local management of coral reefs seamancore as a new user friendly ecological model to assess the effects of simultaneous global and local stressors on coral reef communities first we developed a model based on coral reef ecological theory prioritizing the processes connecting benthic substrate with the fish community and anthropogenic pressures and parameterized it to exemplify the dynamics of indo pacific coral reefs we then developed a menu based user friendly interface to allow users with no programming experience to simulate scenarios of different stressor combinations it includes a detailed and customizable setup which lets users apply the model to a range of tropical regions the data required to parameterize a case study are kept to a minimum and can be collected in a rapid assessment of the coral reef study site seamancore can be used to explore the potential temporal trajectories of coral reefs under different scenarios of depth profile nutrient levels bleaching frequency and fishery management strategies in the following sections we describe seamancore s principles and equations and perform sensitivity analyses to highlight the model s sensitivity to its ecological parameters we then exemplify its utility by exploring scenarios of no stressors and sets of four fishing and three bleaching regimes in a theoretical coral reef 2 methods seamancore is a two dimensional spatially explicit model representing the dynamics of a coral reef under the influence of local and global stressors it focuses on the dynamics of three selected fish and four benthic functional groups the ecological relationships amongst them and the influence of three stressors i e climate change fishing and eutrophication each time step represents one day which is the highest temporal resolution of the modelled processes the model domain is defined using a continuous cellular automaton ca grid which represents the benthos of one coral reef patch of up to 1000 x 1000 m 1 km2 with a resolution of 10 x 10 cm a second lower resolution grid layer is superimposed characterizing the dynamics of three idealized fish functional groups i e browsers and grazers bg scrapers s and carnivores car herbivorous functional groups were loosely based on green and bellwood 2009 the browser and grazer group represents herbivores feeding on macroalgae i e browsers including unicornfishes rudderfishes and batfishes and algal turf i e grazers such as surgeonfishes rabbitfishes and small angelfishes scrapers feed on epilithic algal turf and remove sediment and other material by closely cropping or scraping the reef surface limiting the establishment of algae and providing areas of clean substratum for coral recruitment green and bellwood 2009 the scraper group represents parrotfish species carnivores or piscivores feed on the other two fish groups and represent groupers snappers barracudas jacks and other reef piscivorous species see appendix a in supplementary material for the species included in the parameterization each fish cell represents an area of 400 m2 containing 40 000 benthos cells the model is updated asynchronously to represent the different biological processes at suitable temporal scales the fish grid is updated on a daily basis to account for the processes driving fish population dynamics and influence on the benthos i e growth recruitment feeding predation natural mortality and mortality from fishing explained in detail in section 2 3 the benthos ca is updated every seven days while the influence of disturbances including herbivorous feeding destructive fishing and bleaching is computed daily to align with their dynamic representation in the model and to prioritize their effect over slower benthic dynamic processes the model features torus conditions to avoid boundary born artefacts except for the rules updating the benthos e g vegetative growth which use a mirror approach to avoid anomalous growth leading to unrealistic compositions at different depths see details in appendix a in supplementary material the model was developed using the mason multiagent simulation toolkit http cs gmu edu eclab projects mason and is written in java programming language the software is open access and can be downloaded from this repository the link will be made publicly available upon manuscript acceptance the program requires a greyscale bathymetric map of the field site see details in appendix b in supplementary material to assign a depth category to each benthos cell depth is associated with changes in benthic composition williams et al 2013 and the functional and taxonomic diversity of reef fish tuya et al 2017 in the model depth categories influence the probability of occurrence of benthic ecological processes and determine whether grid cells will be affected by stressors a certain level of stochasticity is included in the benthos initialization and ca processes by reducing their probability of occurrence and thus adapting average execution of model rules to natural time frames the fishery module allocates fishing effort randomly choosing among the cells that meet the fishery defined characteristics the processes for each fish functional group e g growth mortality immigration etc are calculated with specific mathematical functions which are applied after all other conditions are fulfilled 2 1 grid initialization benthos initialization requires three input items a a greyscale map representing the depth profile of the reef b the initial cover ratio of each benthic category at each depth and c the cell type aggregation levels i e degree to which that habitat type is found in clumps with this information the model creates the initial benthic distribution of the reef benthos cells can be set up at a higher or lower aggregated form computing coral cells first to give them greater priority of aggregation the proportion p of cells of type c to be located inside an aggregation at a given depth d is given by 1 p c d c o v e r r a t i o c d a g g r r a t i o c d where c o v e r r a t i o c d is the benthic cover and a g g r r a t i o c d is the aggregation level of cell type c an aggregation seed is placed at a randomly selected location and then grows until attaining a predefined size s given by 2 s m i n a g g r s i z e c r u n p l a c e d c e l l s c d m i n a g g r s i z e c where m i n a g g r s i z e c is the minimum number of cells to form an aggregation r is a random value between 0 1 and u n p l a c e d c e l l s c d is the number of cells yet to be placed inside an aggregation u n p l a c e d c e l l s c d is initially calculated multiplying p c d with the total number of cells at depth d and reduced by s after building each aggregation seeds are placed until u n p l a c e d c e l l s c d m i n a g g r s i z e c after that the other cell types are distributed randomly the initial biomass of the different fish functional groups is needed as input to initialize the fish grid in this case depth is not taken into account because in the model fish can move and relocate every time step in response to benthic habitat fish biomass is distributed across the grid taking into account each group s maximum biomass k i 2 2 benthos benthos grid cells belong to one of four categories at any given time step coral c macroalgae and turf mat hard substrate hs and non stabilized substrate nss coral cells represent a generic hard coral super class and compete for space with mat the category of hard substrate is used here sensu cropped algae category in mumby 2006 and includes encrusting coralline algae short grazed algal turf and rocky bottom a substratum that is likely to increase the settlement of coral recruits vermeij 2005 mumby 2006 roth and knowlton 2009 the non stabilized substrate category refers to bare substrate currently unsuitable for settlement of algal or coral recruits e g sand rubble benthos dynamics explained in detail in appendix a in supplementary material are defined by a the rules of the cellular automaton and b disturbances applied to it cell age triggers the application of the benthos ca rules which reflect the processes of coral algae competition for space and the degree of connectivity with neighbouring coral reefs through additional coral larval supply coral and mat cells turn into hard substrate by competition with mat and coral respectively fig 1 a cell can only turn into coral or mat by transitioning through the state of hard substrate this is to mechanistically represent the mortality and posterior colonization by a competitor and the chance that colonization does not take place due to disturbances affecting the benthic patch first hard substrate turns into coral by 1 coral colonization and 2 external supply of recruits and into mat through 1 mat colonization or 2 cell maturation or aging when a hard substrate cell is not grazed by scrapers for a certain amount of time parameterized after published algal growth rates see appendix a in supplementary material it is assumed that the short grazed turf grows to become a mat mumby 2006 hard substrate aging and colonization are affected by the selected nutrient scenario nss cells can change only into hard substrate by the global pre colonization rule fig 1 this rule is seldom applied and its function is to introduce a chance of slow rebound of the reef in case of catastrophic benthic disturbance disturbances include foraging from herbivorous fish groups bleaching and destructive fishing including bomb fishing and poison or chemical fishing two widespread and prevalent fishing methods used in southeast asian coral reefs burke et al 2011 with bomb fishing homemade ammonium or potassium nitrate fertilizer fuel bombs are thrown into schools of fish resulting in a catch of up to 10 20 kg of fish mcmanus et al 1997 this unselective practice is known to damage existing benthic substrate in the detonation site turning living coral reef substrate into rubble mcmanus et al 1997 chozin 2008 in the model the bomb fishing disturbance turns every type of cell into nss and it resets the age of pre existing nss cells poison fishing is done by a diver squirting a potassium cyanide solution into holes and crevices of the reef to stun and catch high value demersal species commonly marketed in the live reef fish food trade radjawali 2012 this method causes bleaching of the coral and can kill other living benthic organisms hlavacs 2008 in the model the effect of cyanide fishing is represented by changing mat and coral cells into hard substrate fish graze and browse on mat cells changing them into a hard substrate state scraper foraging affects hard substrate cells by resetting their age bleaching mortality is represented by changing corals to hard substrate while sub lethal bleaching is also considered gates 1990 which resets coral cells age without changing the cell type 2 3 fish fish cells 20 x 20 m are governed by a biomass function that is updated every time step for each fish group fish biomass within a given fish cell is defined as 3 b i c t 1 b t i c 1 f i c b t i c where b t i c is the biomass of the fish group i in cell c and f i c b t i c is a function of the net growth for each fish functional group i the net growth function f i c b t i c accounts for the gains and losses of biomass for the functional group i and is given by 4 f i c b t i

the coral cover ratio calculated as the proportion of benthic cells within the fish cell reflecting the increased probability of fish recruitment by an increased provision of refugia and food mediated by high coral cover jones et al 2004 gurney et al 2013 kerry and bellwood 2015 internal recruitment p i n t i c occurs when the conditions for minimum reproductive biomass threshold γi and minimum biomass consumed through feeding θi are met and is defined as 7 p i n t i c ρ i c c o v e r c b t i c 1 b t i c k i where ρ i is the group s average reproduction rate and k i is the carrying capacity or the maximum biomass for the fish group if the conditions are not met p i n t i c 0 each fish group has a linear mortality term 8 m i c δ i b t i c where δ i is the group s average death rate the feeding process has different dynamics for each fish group the amount of prey consumed is calculated by group specific feeding equations and the result is transformed to obtain the biomass gained by the predator as 9 φ i c c i p π p i c where p π p i c is the summed amount of food consumed for all preys p and c i is a constant representing the group s conversion factor the feeding of both carnivores and scrapers is calculated by a reformulation of holling s disc equation to reflect multiple prey holling 1959 hilborn and walters 1992 moustahfid et al 2010 scrapers typically remove portions of the underlying carbonate substratum feeding on both hard substrate and coral cells in the model carnivores feed on both scrapers and bg for predation to take place an additional condition of minimum prey biomass ratio μ must be met the minimum prey biomass ratio is calculated as biomass of prey maximum biomass of prey k i if the minimum prey biomass is met in a cell predation of bg prey is given by 10 π b g c a r c α b g b t b g c 1 j α j τ j b t j c b t c a r c where α b g is the attack rate for browsers and grazers b t b g c is the biomass of browsers and grazers and j refers to all the prey groups eaten by carnivores i e bg and scrapers the consumed biomass of scrapers is also calculated with eq 10 the predation equation represents the predator s switching behaviour in response to prey relative abundance by which the biomass of prey caught per unit time increases when the alternative prey group has lower biomass browsers and grazers feed on mat cells turning them into hard substrate their feeding rate is a parabolic function that peaks at an optimal mat cover to reflect the reduced herbivory observed in large algal patches in contrast to open space with small food patches e g ledlie et al 2007 hoey and bellwood 2011 vergés et al 2011 browsers and grazers feeding is given by 11 π m a t b g c b t m a t c υ m a t r t c m a t r o p t 2 m a t r m i n m a t r o

be driven by habitat quality the intraspecific density of the current and surrounding cells and a permanence factor ωi the permanence factor is a weight given to the behaviour of fish remaining in a

because fish have been shown to avoid areas of high macroalgae cover friedlander and parrish 1998 friedlander et al 2007 wismer et al 2009 vergés et al 2011 potentially as a result of increased predation risk hoey and bellwood 2011 habitat quality for scrapers increases linearly with coral preferred habitat and with hard substrate cover containing the epilithic algal matrix as food resource

temporal scales can be specified in each simulation bleaching frequency nutrient levels and fishing bleaching is the model s proxy for ocean warming and has two effects on the benthos bleaching mortality and non lethal bleaching fig 1 each bleaching episode affects a proportion of randomly selected coral cells at each depth based on reported mild bleaching episodes in indonesia sartin and setiasih 2011 bridge et al 2013 appendix a in supplementary material the user can specify the frequency of bleaching episodes by changing parameter β the model can describe three nutrient scenarios low medium and high the low nutrients scenario contains the standard parameterization with average algae growth rates obtained from the literature appendix a in supplementary material in the medium nutrients scenario the benthos rules for aging and mat colonization are changed by decreasing the time needed for a hard substrate cell to become mat by 20 whereas the high nutrients scenario changes this amount by 40 we arbitrarily chose a 20 change in the growth rates because of the marked interspecific variability and high level of uncertainty in the literature due to the complexity of the processes involved the time used for applying the colonization and aging rules with nutrient scenarios can also be modified in the user interface if more information becomes available or alternative plausible values are obtained for the model s application site the fishery module operates at the fish grid level and allocates fishing effort across the cells the user can add an unlimited number of fishing techniques which are defined by a customisable set of parameters including a number of fishing units fleet b time allocation or fishing frequency c maximum catch per unit of effort d catchable proportion of the fish biomass per time step per cell e maximum number of grid cells a fishing unit can visit per time step f depth categories affected g target fish groups susceptible to fishing mortality h minimum fishable biomass per fish cell and i fishing style the fishing style parameter defines the damage done to the reef habitat non destructive fishing does not affect the benthos grid bomb fishing affects the benthos by turning a randomly selected 4 m2 area of benthos into nss cells while cyanide fishing turns all coral and mat cells in a randomly selected 1 m2 area into hard subtrate these effects are based on impacts reported by mcmanus et al 1997 and hlavacs 2008 2 5 user interface and parameterization seamancore was developed with the aim of facilitating scenario testing of particular case studies using routinely gathered monitoring data i e benthos cover fish biomass and a bathymetric map the user friendly interface has two modes of use standard and advanced the standard mode allows the user to input initial and boundary conditions i e depth profile initial benthos cover and aggregation ratios initial fish biomass and stressors while the advanced mode allows for modification of the entire suite of model parameters including biological rates and thresholds the standard mode is currently parameterized to represent coral reefs of the indo pacific appendix a in supplementary material tables a 4 5 the baseline parameterization appendix a in supplementary material was based on available literature data and plausible estimation where needed and only considering information from other regions if no sufficient information was available for the indo pacific input parameters and initial conditions can be changed according to case specific abundance of functional groups fishing pressure and biophysical conditions detailed instructions for the use of interface menus are given in appendix b in supplementary material 2 6 sensitivity analyses sensitivity analyses were run for all parameters to assess their effect on the main response variables first a baseline scenario was parameterized with no stressors to focus on the ecological interactions in a pristine scenario initial benthos cover was specified at 0 25 for all benthos groups and the initial fish biomass was 20 g m 2 for bg and scrapers and 10 g m 2 for carnivores see parameterization details in appendix a in supplementary material to measure parameter sensitivity we changed one parameter at a time and reported the relative change in the response variables namely coral cover mat cover and the biomasses of bg scrapers and carnivores between time steps 500 and 7300 the initial spin up period was intended to allow the model to stabilise for fish parameters each of the baseline values was increased and decreased by 25 for environmental parameters we gradually increased connectivity bleaching and nutrients from the baseline settings as follows nutrient scenarios medium and high bleaching frequency every 1 2 and 4 years connectivity for coral and carnivores was modified 25 and for bg and scrapers the values of 250 and 500 g were tested due to its value in the baseline being 0 finally we included simulations with two different random seeds to display the influence of stochastic effects on the simulation results 2 7 scenario testing several scenarios exemplifying different fishing conditions and bleaching frequency were run to illustrate the model s behaviour first a baseline scenario with the same parameterization as in the sensitivity analysis was run with no fishing or bleaching see appendix a in supplementary material second we explored four scenarios of fishing at all depths at a catch rate of 10 kg and 20 kg per day in scenarios of 1 non selective fishing e g all fish groups are targeted and 2 selectivity for carnivores only finally three bleaching scenarios were simulated 1 a medium frequency bleaching scenario with a bleaching episode occurring every 10 years 2 a high frequency bleaching scenario with bleaching occurring every 2 years in line with predictions by hughes et al 2018 and 3 a high bleaching frequency of 2 years combined with a high nutrients scenario each scenario was run for 20 years with 5 different seeds and their time series averaged the benthos cover and fish biomass presented is the average for the entire simulated reef with the depths averaged the results may vary if a different depth map is used as depth affects several benthic processes we used a moving average function with a window of 50 days to smooth the time series plots to better reveal the patterns in the data all data analyses were analysed using r version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter sensitivity under the model s premises mat cover was quantitatively the most sensitive variable to all parameter types while scrapers biomass bg biomass and coral cover were the least affected fig 2 fish parameters pertaining to the carnivore group were the most influential for the model variables showing top down control from predators changes in carnivore s death rate prey minimum biomass ratio and conversion factor had the highest impact as did browsers and grazers conversion factor the later by producing the largest reduction in carnivore biomass and a 100 increase in mat cover when the conversion factor was reduced by 25 fig 2 the strong effects of changes in the conversion factors of all fish groups are in agreement with the notion that trophic transfer efficiency is an important parameter for biomass fluctuations jennings et al 2008 increasing the death rate of carnivores had a positive effect on hard coral cover a result also found by holmes johnston 2010 as browsers and grazers removed more competing mat when their predation pressure was relieved a decrease in the carrying capacity of scrapers produced large reductions across all fish groups because prey biomass for carnivores was reduced and caused an increase in their feeding on browsers and grazers this however did not maintain the carnivore biomass levels of the baseline scenario the environmental parameters had a milder effect on the model variables except for the anthropogenic disturbances i e nutrient scenarios and bleaching frequency fig 3 changing the nutrient scenario both to medium and high affected the entire suite of response variables to a greatest degree fig 3 as could be expected since the nutrient scenario simultaneously changes three ca rules two by 40 and one by 20 the high nutrients scenario caused a 191 increase in mat a 52 decrease in coral cover and a 42 decrease in scrapers biomass the frequency of bleaching episodes could be seen gradually in all groups except in mat and scrapers which did not show a clear pattern the free space left by the reduction in coral cover caused an increase in mat which was quickly transferred up the trophic chain to browsers and grazers and then to carnivores scrapers lack of response to a change in bleaching frequency is because as the scraper group in our model feed on both coral and hard substrate the change did not affect their food source as bleaching only resets coral age or turns coral into hard substrate parameters pertaining to the degree of connectivity with neighbouring reefs did not have as strong an effect as the parameters explored above 3 2 scenario runs the scenario simulations included a baseline or healthy environment scenario two different fishing selectivity and catch rates and two bleaching frequencies in general the benthos time series display the trade off between hard substrate and mat and coral fig 4 due to hard substrate being the precursor of mat both by growth and colonization and coral trough colonization the small fluctuations observed in coral hs and mat cover trajectories reflect the competition and colonization processes ocurring in the benthos ca browsers and grazers had the highest fish biomass which responds to fluctuations in algae cover and proportion of coral cover coral was the predominant benthic type under all scenarios except the one where high bleaching and high nutrients occurred together fig 5 c nss remained constant due to its low probability of colonization in the baseline scenario i e no fishing and no stressors coral cover increased slowly from having the same initial coverage as the other benthic groups to stabilizing at nearly 60 cover for about 10 years fig 4 a this cover was matched in three of the fishing scenarios the two unselective and the one with a higher catch rate for carnivores fig 4 b c and e while in the low catch rate selective for carnivores coral cover remained between 30 40 fig 4 d the high biomass of browsers and grazers sustained by these fishing regimes caused in part by the release in carnivore predation pressure and partly by an optimal algal cover appears to benefit coral colonization by reducing algae cover and is the reason for the coral cover increase at the beginning of the simulations time once the dominant benthos type coral enhances fish reproduction creating a positive feedback between coral cover and fish biomass that is widely reported in the coral reef literature jones et al 2004 graham et al 2006 sandin et al 2008 this initial feedback is also responsible for sustaining high coral cover in the high frequency bleaching scenario fig 5 b which did not include any other stressors a result that suggests that the reef is able to sustain moderate levels of benthic disturbance if the frequency of disturbance does not surpass the threshold of natural variation lambert et al 2017 nevertheless the reef s capacity to cope with a new disturbance is reduced sawall et al 2013 nyström et al 2000 baker et al 2008 in the scenario combining high nutrients and high bleaching frequency fig 5 c possibly through habitat fragmentation in this scenario algae cover remains at 40 50 throughout most of the simulation time while coral cover is reduced at the beginning from 25 to about 10 but increases slowly to recover the initial 25 cover this result can be interpreted as coral taxonomic composition favouring more thermally and nutrient resistant corals alternatively model users may want to be more specific and customize coral growth rates to fit those observed in their case study benthos changes were amplified in the fish community by their feedback relationships fluctuations in mat cover produced wide variations in the biomass of bg until both stabilize by modulating one another the highest bg biomass occurred in the baseline and unselective fishing scenarios and the lowest in the selective fishing scenarios focusing all the fishing effort on carnivores reduced their biomass importantly with a subsequent release of bg from predation pressure in this case a balance is reached between mat and bg which does not give way to big fluctuations because no predation on bg means that they graze continually and mat are contained at low cover the widest amplitude in bg biomass occurred in the bleaching scenarios fig 5 and the narrowest in the selective fishing scenarios fig 4 d e bg biomass tends to stabilize around 25 30 g m 2 in all simulations consistent with biomass estimates from global data for unfished areas edwards et al 2014 scrapers biomass is quite stable and low throughout the simulated scenarios between 5 6 g m 2 these values are lower than the global 14 4 g m 2 estimated by edwards et al 2014 for unfished areas in the selective fishing scenarios their biomass is slightly higher at about 7 g m 2 once stabilized which shows that they respond to predation pressure from carnivores however it is clear that the model underestimates scraper biomass and this remains a point to be improved in the future carnivore biomass is less fluctuating than bg but responding to their variations and is maintained around 10 g m 2 in all simulations carnivore biomass is difficult to compare because it varies depending on trophic coral reef structure boaden kingsford 2015 graham et al 2017 but 10 g m 2 falls within reported values e g mccoy et al 2015 the basic model simulations suggest that a healthy coral reef may find a coral dominated equilibrium when exposed to one mild stressor if nutrients are low and there is no fishing pressure in this case the relatively mild bleaching episodes as opposed to recent catastrophic bleaching events e g hughes et al 2017 were compensated by the unaffected coral cover at depths below 10 m however the competitive advantage of corals is reduced in a scenario of combined stressors producing mat dominance of the benthos the dynamics resulting from these simulations may differ depending on the multiple context dependent characteristics considered in this model such as the total area and the depth distribution of the case study as mentioned above the goal of these simulations is to illustrate the results that seamancore can produce 3 3 model assumptions and limitations the model presented here is a simplification of a coral reef ecosystem intended to represent the processes of benthos dynamics and trophic relationships relevant to fishing yield and habitat structure within one coral reef our effort to integrate spatially explicit fish dynamics came at the expense of a simplification of coral algal demographics in comparison with other models however we expect that linking fish demographics with changing habitat quality will prove insightful for fisheries management as such model outcomes should be interpreted in the context of the underlying assumptions and the represented components and processes first seamancore represents the habitats in the fore reef and reef crest and not the lagoon or back reef and does not account for natural erosion processes and wave action we are aware that important benthic functional groups are missing from the model such as benthic invertebrates with important ecological roles sea urchins or crown of thorns starfish feeding rates can exert strong controls over the abundance of the represented benthos groups organisms which have been shown to dominate in certain phase shifts such as soft corals and sponges are included within the mat group as hard corals competitors when using field data as initial conditions for the model and other benthic invertebrates within the hard substrate type while the model could be expanded to include the specific dynamics of those organisms its current purpose is to represent competition processes between corals and its competitors given their relevance for habitat structure likewise not all corals have the same ecological functions branching corals are known to increase structural complexity and to be a preferred fish habitat while being more vulnerable to bleaching and mechanical damage grimsditch and salm 2006 baldock et al 2014 in contrast with massive corals wilson et al 2008 we averaged the growth rates of the most common species reported in some case studies of the indo pacific for the current parameterization however because of the large flexibility in community composition across coral reefs hughes et al 2012 it is important for obtaining realistic model results to derive case specific growth rate estimates according to the species composition of future study sites numerous ecological factors can influence the functional response of predators in widely diverse ways hunsicker et al 2011 that are hard to quantify and scale to entire functional groups this model does not include the effect of high predator density or the influence of seasonal patterns in water temperature on predator behaviour harborne 2012 due to a lack of mechanistic understanding in the coral reef literature stier and white 2014 we did not take into account shifts in foraging behaviour that may have been caused by predator abundance driving predator predator interactions and or antipredator behaviour in prey and had to fit the predation behaviour parameters loosely based on freshwater studies miller et al 1992 predator predator interference takes place indirectly in the migration module where habitat quality decreases for carnivorous fish with increasing congeneric density we did not delve into the effects of high prey densities in feeding rates which in some cases have been reported to decrease the feeding rate presenting a dome shaped functional response harborne 2012 jeschke et al 2004 overfishing destructive fishing and watershed pollution have been ranked as the strongest local threads faced by coral reefs around the world burke et al 2011 we chose to model them along with the largest perceived global threat i e global ocean warming however other impacts such as ocean acidification or cots outbreaks are not considered in the model additionally bleaching is assumed to occur at a fixed frequency in the form of a single event this is a gross simplification as climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of bleaching events something which other coral reef models have considered through the inclusion of published temperature projections e g ortiz et al 2014 bozec and mumby 2015 kwiatkowski et al 2015 weijerman et al 2015 ainsworth et al 2016 bozec et al 2016 the effect of land run off and pollution introducing nutrients in the system is reflected in the model by an increase in algal extension rates but not in their interaction with coral since there is no definitive evidence that nutrients increase the competitive advantage of algae e g mccook et al 2001 vermeij et al 2010 other reported effects of nutrification were not considered due to paucity in quantitative or mechanistic information available for instance terrestrial nutrients are suspected to enhance acanthaster spp larval survival pratchett et al 2014 wooldridge and brodie 2015 and to play a role in increasing the vulnerability of corals to thermal bleaching wooldridge 2016 modelling efforts such as this study would benefit from more experimental large scale field studies such as before after control impact baci experiments that gradually modify environmental factors to assess and quantify their ecosystem wide effects in detail 4 conclusions seamancore is a quantitative tool to explore potential outcomes of different resource management and environmental scenarios by simulating the dynamics of relevant coral reef functional groups the model brings together complex elements of a coral reef ecosystem in a spatially explicit setup this user friendly and computationally efficient coral reef model is intended to assist local management of coral reefs and can thus be parameterized with limited field data routinely collected in basic coral reef monitoring programs flower et al 2017 these include a greyscale bathymetric image benthic cover by group and biomass of the three functional groups appendix b in supplementary material the large variety of settings allows for substantial case study customization seamancore can be used as an exploratory tool for local management and as a tool to explore the influence of different anthropogenic stressors on the functional groups population dynamics it can be useful for testing potential synergistic effects between stressors and compare the outcomes to other models with similar scope e g gurney et al 2013 and can be used to assess whether one stressor is more detrimental than another e g nutrification vs fishing under case specific environmental conditions its menu display contains parameters that allow for the simulation of the effects of diverse fishing management strategies including fishing selectivity quotas zonation and number of fishing units it can be used to explore how a no take area or time period fisheries closure would affect the local reef seamancore s modular framework was developed to allow easy additions or

25254,simulation models have a broad potential as decision support tools for resource management by mechanistically representing and projecting complex ecological processes in the case of socioeconomically and biologically important coral reef ecosystems models have been used to address important questions regarding the effects of human impacts on their ecological dynamics and to inform management approaches however few of the models integrate benthic and fish dynamics with the influence of external anthropogenic stressors and virtually none is available as a user friendly platform for non scientist managers to easily access we propose a new ecological model to assess the effects of simultaneous stressors on coral reef ecosystems which includes a dynamic representation of benthic and fish spatial processes linked by their ecological feedbacks seamancore is a two dimensional model representing the dynamics of local coral reefs which can be used to explore the influence of bleaching eutrophication and fishing including destructive fishing such as bomb and cyanide fishing the model is coupled with a menu based interface that allows users with no programming experience to simulate numerous scenarios in specific contexts that can be customized with depth profile maps and initial coral reef conditions of fish and benthos functional group abundance this study includes seamancore s description and shows the model s sensitivity to its parameters by means of sensitivity analyses its utility is exemplified by exploring various scenarios of no stressors

reduction in the coral reef ecosystem s resilience due to previous exposure to a different stressor ban et al 2014 nyström et al 2000 pandolfi et al 2011 for instance poor water quality has been linked to lower bleaching resistance in coastal symbiotic corals compared to corals in more oligotrophic reefs wooldridge 2009 wooldridge and done 2009 these observed impacts have led to the anticipation that coral reef ecosystems as we know them will be rare by 2050 hoegh guldberg and bruno 2010 and that the emergence of novel assemblages of species composition and interactions graham et al 2014 will have consequences for subsistence based coastal societies and regional economies through impacts on fisheries coastal protection and tourism hoegh guldberg et al 2007 to mitigate negative impacts on coral reefs effective science based management is needed to achieve trade offs where desired ecological states can be maintained while being less taxing on reef dependent human communities computational models are important decision support tools and can also help improve our understanding of the complex ecological links and feedbacks found in coral reefs by providing a mechanistic

et al 2006 pratchett et al 2008 explicit habitat dynamics are rarely represented in detail in such ecosystem based management models randomness in the occurrence of interactions and the role of habitat distribution on the outcomes of those interactions make it relevant to consider spatially explicit simulations for their study wallentin 2017 detailed spatial models of coral reef benthic

dynamics of upper trophic levels a few models linking fish and benthic dynamics include works on the impact of loss of prey refugia on coral reef fish size spectra rogers et al 2014 and of coral cover on fisheries productivity ainsworth and mumby 2015 albeit not being spatially explicit furthermore most of the aforementioned models have focused on caribbean coral reefs while coral reef dynamic models for the indo pacific area remain scant in comparison indo pacific coral reef dynamics fundamentally differ from the caribbean leading to a seemingly overall greater resilience roff and mumby

the central indo pacific under future global warming and ocean acidification guinotte et al 2003 couce et al 2013 parameterizing models for pacific coral reefs is challenged by a lack of adequately collected data until the 1980 s and a likely varying historical baseline data due to subregional variation in disturbance regimes and morphology of dominant coral species bruno and selig 2007 some notable contributions include ecosim models addressing ecosystem based fisheries management research priorities for raja ampat in indonesia ainsworth et al 2008 and a spatially explicit mean field

managers despite the demonstrated power of modelling approaches for evaluating sets of management scenarios weijerman et al 2015 and the substantial progress and growing number of coral reef models their complexity and demand for technical expertise mean they remain largely out of reach for the stakeholder community nielsen et al 2017 this is unfortunate as community based conservation has been shown to be a successful and desirable management strategy white et al 1994 cinner et al 2016 particularly in regions characterized by decentralized overexploitation of marine resources the case in

from education programs and the involvement of traditional fishermen white and vogt 2000 by providing user friendly platforms with easy to obtain data requirements models can help stakeholders explore the likely outcomes of management strategies across a range of socio ecological variables building upon earlier models developed to aid local coral reef management e g chang et al 2008 buddemeier et al 2008 holmes and johnstone 2010 weijerman et al 2015 we propose a spatially explicit simulation model for assisting the local management of coral reefs seamancore as a new user friendly ecological model to assess the effects of simultaneous global and local stressors on coral reef communities first we developed a model based on coral reef ecological theory prioritizing the processes connecting benthic substrate with the fish community and anthropogenic pressures and parameterized it to exemplify the dynamics of indo pacific coral reefs we then developed a menu based user friendly interface to allow users with no programming experience to simulate scenarios of different stressor combinations it includes a detailed and customizable setup which lets users apply the model to a range of tropical regions the data required to parameterize a case study are kept to a minimum and can be collected in a rapid assessment of the coral reef study site seamancore can be used to explore the potential temporal trajectories of coral reefs under different scenarios of depth profile nutrient levels bleaching frequency and fishery management strategies in the following sections we describe seamancore s principles and equations and perform sensitivity analyses to highlight the model s sensitivity to its ecological parameters we then exemplify its utility by exploring scenarios of no stressors and sets of four fishing and three bleaching regimes in a theoretical coral reef 2 methods seamancore is a two dimensional spatially explicit model representing the dynamics of a coral reef under the influence of local and global stressors it focuses on the dynamics of three selected fish and four benthic functional groups the ecological relationships amongst them and the influence of three stressors i e climate change fishing and eutrophication each time step represents one day which is the highest temporal resolution of the modelled processes the model domain is defined using a continuous cellular automaton ca grid which represents the benthos of one coral reef patch of up to 1000 x 1000 m 1 km2 with a resolution of 10 x 10 cm a second lower resolution grid layer is superimposed characterizing the dynamics of three idealized fish functional groups i e browsers and grazers bg scrapers s and carnivores car herbivorous functional groups were loosely based on green and bellwood 2009 the browser and grazer group represents herbivores feeding on macroalgae i e browsers including unicornfishes rudderfishes and batfishes and algal turf i e grazers such as surgeonfishes rabbitfishes and small angelfishes scrapers feed on epilithic algal turf and remove sediment and other material by closely cropping or scraping the reef surface limiting the establishment of algae and providing areas of clean substratum for coral recruitment green and bellwood 2009 the scraper group represents parrotfish species carnivores or piscivores feed on the other two fish groups and represent groupers snappers barracudas jacks and other reef piscivorous species see appendix a in supplementary material for the species included in the parameterization each fish cell represents an area of 400 m2 containing 40 000 benthos cells the model is updated asynchronously to represent the different biological processes at suitable temporal scales the fish grid is updated on a daily basis to account for the processes driving fish population dynamics and influence on the benthos i e growth recruitment feeding predation natural mortality and mortality from fishing explained in detail in section 2 3 the benthos ca is updated every seven days while the influence of disturbances including herbivorous feeding destructive fishing and bleaching is computed daily to align with their dynamic representation in the model and to prioritize their effect over slower benthic dynamic processes the model features torus conditions to avoid boundary born artefacts except for the rules updating the benthos e g vegetative growth which use a mirror approach to avoid anomalous growth leading to unrealistic compositions at different depths see details in appendix a in supplementary material the model was developed using the mason multiagent simulation toolkit http cs gmu edu eclab projects mason and is written in java programming language the software is open access and can be downloaded from this repository the link will be made publicly available upon manuscript acceptance the program requires a greyscale bathymetric map of the field site see details in appendix b in supplementary material to assign a depth category to each benthos cell depth is associated with changes in benthic composition williams et al 2013 and the functional and taxonomic diversity of reef fish tuya et al 2017 in the model depth categories influence the probability of occurrence of benthic ecological processes and determine whether grid cells will be affected by stressors a certain level of stochasticity is included in the benthos initialization and ca processes by reducing their probability of occurrence and thus adapting average execution of model rules to natural time frames the fishery module allocates fishing effort randomly choosing among the cells that meet the fishery defined characteristics the processes for each fish functional group e g growth mortality immigration etc are calculated with specific mathematical functions which are applied after all other conditions are fulfilled 2 1 grid initialization benthos initialization requires three input items a a greyscale map representing the depth profile of the reef b the initial cover ratio of each benthic category at each depth and c the cell type aggregation levels i e degree to which that habitat type is found in clumps with this information the model creates the initial benthic distribution of the reef benthos cells can be set up at a higher or lower aggregated form computing coral cells first to give them greater priority of aggregation the proportion p of cells of type c to be located inside an aggregation at a given depth d is given by 1 p c d c o v e r r a t i o c d a g g r r a t i o c d where c o v e r r a t i o c d is the benthic cover and a g g r r a t i o c d is the aggregation level of cell type c an aggregation seed is placed at a randomly selected location and then grows until attaining a predefined size s given by 2 s m i n a g g r s i z e c r u n p l a c e d c e l l s c d m i n a g g r s i z e c where m i n a g g r s i z e c is the minimum number of cells to form an aggregation r is a random value between 0 1 and u n p l a c e d c e l l s c d is the number of cells yet to be placed inside an aggregation u n p l a c e d c e l l s c d is initially calculated multiplying p c d with the total number of cells at depth d and reduced by s after building each aggregation seeds are placed until u n p l a c e d c e l l s c d m i n a g g r s i z e c after that the other cell types are distributed randomly the initial biomass of the different fish functional groups is needed as input to initialize the fish grid in this case depth is not taken into account because in the model fish can move and relocate every time step in response to benthic habitat fish biomass is distributed across the grid taking into account each group s maximum biomass k i 2 2 benthos benthos grid cells belong to one of four categories at any given time step coral c macroalgae and turf mat hard substrate hs and non stabilized substrate nss coral cells represent a generic hard coral super class and compete for space with mat the category of hard substrate is used here sensu cropped algae category in mumby 2006 and includes encrusting coralline algae short grazed algal turf and rocky bottom a substratum that is likely to increase the settlement of coral recruits vermeij 2005 mumby 2006 roth and knowlton 2009 the non stabilized substrate category refers to bare substrate currently unsuitable for settlement of algal or coral recruits e g sand rubble benthos dynamics explained in detail in appendix a in supplementary material are defined by a the rules of the cellular automaton and b disturbances applied to it cell age triggers the application of the benthos ca rules which reflect the processes of coral algae competition for space and the degree of connectivity with neighbouring coral reefs through additional coral larval supply coral and mat cells turn into hard substrate by competition with mat and coral respectively fig 1 a cell can only turn into coral or mat by transitioning through the state of hard substrate this is to mechanistically represent the mortality and posterior colonization by a competitor and the chance that colonization does not take place due to disturbances affecting the benthic patch first hard substrate turns into coral by 1 coral colonization and 2 external supply of recruits and into mat through 1 mat colonization or 2 cell maturation or aging when a hard substrate cell is not grazed by scrapers for a certain amount of time parameterized after published algal growth rates see appendix a in supplementary material it is assumed that the short grazed turf grows to become a mat mumby 2006 hard substrate aging and colonization are affected by the selected nutrient scenario nss cells can change only into hard substrate by the global pre colonization rule fig 1 this rule is seldom applied and its function is to introduce a chance of slow rebound of the reef in case of catastrophic benthic disturbance disturbances include foraging from herbivorous fish groups bleaching and destructive fishing including bomb fishing and poison or chemical fishing two widespread and prevalent fishing methods used in southeast asian coral reefs burke et al 2011 with bomb fishing homemade ammonium or potassium nitrate fertilizer fuel bombs are thrown into schools of fish resulting in a catch of up to 10 20 kg of fish mcmanus et al 1997 this unselective practice is known to damage existing benthic substrate in the detonation site turning living coral reef substrate into rubble mcmanus et al 1997 chozin 2008 in the model the bomb fishing disturbance turns every type of cell into nss and it resets the age of pre existing nss cells poison fishing is done by a diver squirting a potassium cyanide solution into holes and crevices of the reef to stun and catch high value demersal species commonly marketed in the live reef fish food trade radjawali 2012 this method causes bleaching of the coral and can kill other living benthic organisms hlavacs 2008 in the model the effect of cyanide fishing is represented by changing mat and coral cells into hard substrate fish graze and browse on mat cells changing them into a hard substrate state scraper foraging affects hard substrate cells by resetting their age bleaching mortality is represented by changing corals to hard substrate while sub lethal bleaching is also considered gates 1990 which resets coral cells age without changing the cell type 2 3 fish fish cells 20 x 20 m are governed by a biomass function that is updated every time step for each fish group fish biomass within a given fish cell is defined as 3 b i c t 1 b t i c 1 f i c b t i c where b t i c is the biomass of the fish group i in cell c and f i c b t i c is a function of the net growth for each fish functional group i the net growth function f i c b t i c accounts for the gains and losses of biomass for the functional group i and is given by 4 f i c b t i

representing larvae supply from neighbouring reefs calculated by 6 p e x t i c λ i c c c o v e r c where λ i c is the net amount of larval supply divided amongst all grid cells and c c o v e r c is the coral cover ratio calculated as the proportion of benthic cells within the fish cell reflecting the increased probability of fish recruitment by an increased provision of refugia and food mediated by high coral cover jones et al 2004 gurney et al 2013 kerry and bellwood 2015 internal recruitment p i n t i c occurs when the conditions for minimum reproductive biomass threshold γi and minimum biomass consumed through feeding θi are met and is defined as 7 p i n t i c ρ i c c o v e r c b t i c 1 b t i c k i where ρ i is the group s average reproduction rate and k i is the carrying capacity or the maximum biomass for the fish group if the conditions are not met p i n t i c 0 each fish group has a linear mortality term 8 m i c δ i b t i c where δ i is the group s average death rate the feeding process has different dynamics for each fish group the amount of prey consumed is calculated by group specific feeding equations and the result is transformed to obtain the biomass gained by the predator as 9 φ i c c i p π p i c where p π p i c is the summed amount of food consumed for all preys p and c i is a constant representing the group s conversion factor the feeding of both carnivores and scrapers is calculated by a reformulation of holling s disc equation to reflect multiple prey holling 1959 hilborn and walters 1992 moustahfid et al 2010 scrapers typically remove portions of the underlying carbonate substratum feeding on both hard substrate and coral cells in the model carnivores feed on both scrapers and bg for predation to take place an additional condition of minimum prey biomass ratio μ must be met the minimum prey biomass ratio is calculated as biomass of prey maximum biomass of prey k i if the minimum prey biomass is met in a cell predation of bg prey is given by 10 π b g c a r c α b g b t b g c 1 j α j τ j b t j c b t c a r c where α b g is the attack rate for browsers and grazers b t b g c is the biomass of browsers and grazers and j refers to all the prey groups eaten by carnivores i e bg and scrapers the consumed biomass of scrapers is also calculated with eq 10 the predation equation represents the predator s switching behaviour in response to prey relative abundance by which the biomass of prey caught per unit time increases when the alternative prey group has lower biomass browsers and grazers feed on mat cells turning them into hard substrate their feeding rate is a parabolic function that peaks at an optimal mat cover to reflect the reduced herbivory observed in large algal patches in contrast to open space with small

be driven by habitat quality the intraspecific density of the current and surrounding cells and a permanence factor ωi the permanence factor is a weight given to the behaviour of fish remaining in a

because fish have been shown to avoid areas of high macroalgae cover friedlander and parrish 1998 friedlander et al 2007 wismer et al 2009 vergés et al 2011 potentially as a result of increased predation risk hoey and bellwood 2011 habitat quality for scrapers increases linearly with coral preferred habitat and with hard substrate cover containing the epilithic algal matrix as food resource

temporal scales can be specified in each simulation bleaching frequency nutrient levels and fishing bleaching is the model s proxy for ocean warming and has two effects on the benthos bleaching mortality and non lethal bleaching fig 1 each bleaching episode affects a proportion of randomly selected coral cells at each depth based on reported mild bleaching episodes in indonesia sartin and setiasih 2011 bridge et al 2013 appendix a in supplementary material the user can specify the frequency of bleaching episodes by changing parameter β the model can describe three nutrient scenarios low medium and high the low nutrients scenario contains the standard parameterization with average algae growth rates obtained from the literature appendix a in supplementary material in the medium nutrients scenario the benthos rules for aging and mat colonization are changed by decreasing the time needed for a hard substrate cell to become mat by 20 whereas the high nutrients scenario changes this amount by 40 we arbitrarily chose a 20 change in the growth rates because of the marked interspecific variability and high level of uncertainty in the literature due to the complexity of the processes involved the time used for applying the colonization and aging rules with nutrient scenarios can also be modified in the user interface if more information becomes available or alternative plausible values are obtained for the model s application site the fishery module operates at the fish grid level and allocates fishing effort across the cells the user can add an unlimited number of fishing techniques which are defined by a customisable set of parameters including a number of fishing units fleet b time allocation or fishing frequency c maximum catch per unit of effort d catchable

mortality h minimum fishable biomass per fish cell and i fishing style the fishing style parameter defines the damage done to the reef habitat non destructive fishing does not affect the benthos grid bomb fishing affects the benthos by turning a randomly selected 4 m2 area of benthos into nss cells while cyanide fishing turns all coral and mat cells in a randomly selected 1 m2 area into hard subtrate these effects are based on impacts reported by mcmanus et al 1997 and hlavacs 2008 2 5 user interface and parameterization seamancore was developed with the aim of facilitating scenario testing of particular case studies using routinely gathered monitoring data i e benthos cover fish biomass and a bathymetric map the user friendly interface has two modes of use standard and advanced the standard mode allows the user to input initial and boundary conditions i e depth profile initial benthos cover and aggregation ratios initial fish biomass and stressors while the advanced mode allows for modification of the entire suite of model parameters including biological rates and thresholds the standard mode is currently parameterized to represent coral reefs of the indo pacific appendix a in supplementary material tables a 4 5 the baseline parameterization appendix a in supplementary material was based on available literature data and plausible estimation where needed and only considering information from other regions if no sufficient information was available for the indo pacific input parameters and initial conditions can be changed according to case specific abundance of functional groups fishing pressure and biophysical conditions detailed instructions for the use of interface menus are given in appendix b in supplementary material 2 6 sensitivity analyses sensitivity analyses were run for all parameters to assess their effect on the main response variables first a baseline scenario was parameterized with no stressors to focus on the ecological interactions in a pristine scenario initial benthos cover was specified at 0 25 for all benthos groups and the initial fish biomass was 20 g m 2 for bg and scrapers and 10 g m 2 for carnivores see parameterization details in appendix a in supplementary material to measure parameter sensitivity we changed one parameter at a time and reported the relative change in the response variables namely coral cover mat cover and the biomasses of bg scrapers and carnivores between time steps 500 and 7300 the initial spin up period was intended to allow the model to stabilise for fish parameters each of the baseline values was increased and decreased by 25 for environmental parameters we gradually increased connectivity bleaching and nutrients from the baseline settings as follows nutrient scenarios medium and high bleaching frequency every 1 2 and 4 years connectivity for coral and carnivores was modified 25 and for bg and scrapers the values of 250 and 500 g were tested due to its value in the baseline being 0 finally we included simulations with two different random seeds to display the influence of stochastic effects on the simulation results 2 7 scenario testing several scenarios exemplifying different fishing conditions and bleaching frequency were run to illustrate the model s behaviour first a baseline scenario with the same parameterization as in the sensitivity analysis was run with no fishing or bleaching see appendix a in supplementary material second we explored four scenarios of fishing at all depths at a catch rate of 10 kg and 20 kg per day in scenarios of 1 non selective fishing e g all fish groups are targeted and 2 selectivity for carnivores only finally three bleaching scenarios were simulated 1 a medium frequency bleaching scenario with a bleaching episode occurring every 10 years 2 a high frequency bleaching scenario with bleaching occurring every 2 years in line with predictions by hughes et al 2018 and 3 a high bleaching frequency of 2 years combined with a high nutrients scenario each scenario was run for 20 years with 5 different seeds and their time series averaged the benthos cover and fish biomass presented is the average for the entire simulated reef with the depths averaged the results may vary if a different depth map is used as depth affects several benthic processes we used a moving average function with a window of 50 days to smooth the time series plots to better reveal the patterns in the data all data analyses were analysed using r version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter sensitivity under the model s premises mat cover was quantitatively the most sensitive variable to all parameter types while scrapers biomass bg biomass and coral cover were the least affected fig 2 fish parameters pertaining to the carnivore group were the most influential for the model variables showing top down control from predators changes in carnivore s death rate prey minimum biomass ratio and conversion factor had the highest impact as did browsers and grazers conversion factor the later by producing the largest reduction in carnivore biomass and a 100 increase in mat cover when the conversion factor was reduced by 25 fig 2 the strong effects of changes in the conversion factors of all fish groups are in agreement with the notion that trophic transfer efficiency is an important parameter for biomass fluctuations jennings et al 2008 increasing the death rate of carnivores had a positive effect on hard coral cover a result also found by holmes johnston 2010 as browsers and grazers removed more competing mat when their predation pressure was relieved a decrease in the carrying capacity of scrapers produced large reductions across all fish groups because prey biomass for carnivores was reduced and caused an increase in their feeding on browsers and grazers this however did not maintain the carnivore biomass levels of the baseline scenario the environmental parameters had a milder effect on the model variables except for the anthropogenic disturbances i e nutrient scenarios and bleaching frequency fig 3 changing the nutrient scenario both to medium and high affected the entire suite of response variables to a greatest degree fig 3 as could be expected since the nutrient scenario simultaneously changes three ca rules two by 40 and one by 20 the high nutrients scenario caused a 191 increase in mat a 52 decrease in coral cover and a 42 decrease in scrapers biomass the frequency of bleaching episodes could be seen gradually in all groups except in mat and scrapers which did not show a clear pattern the free space left by the reduction in coral cover caused an increase in mat which was quickly transferred up the trophic chain to browsers and grazers and then to carnivores scrapers lack of response to a change in bleaching frequency is because as the scraper group in our model feed on both coral and hard substrate the change did not affect their food source as bleaching only resets coral age or turns coral into hard substrate parameters pertaining to the degree of connectivity with neighbouring reefs did not have as strong an effect as the parameters explored above 3 2 scenario runs the scenario simulations included a baseline or healthy environment scenario two different fishing selectivity and catch rates and two bleaching frequencies in general the benthos time series display the trade off between hard substrate and mat and coral fig 4 due to hard substrate being the precursor of mat both by growth and colonization and coral trough colonization the small fluctuations observed in coral hs and mat cover trajectories reflect the competition and colonization processes ocurring in the benthos ca browsers and grazers had the highest fish biomass which responds to fluctuations in algae cover and proportion of coral cover coral was the predominant benthic type under all scenarios except the one where high bleaching and high nutrients occurred together fig 5 c nss remained constant due to its low probability of colonization in the baseline scenario i e no fishing and no stressors coral cover increased slowly from having the same initial coverage as the other benthic groups to stabilizing at nearly 60 cover for about 10 years fig 4 a this cover was matched in three of the fishing scenarios the two unselective and the one with a higher catch rate for carnivores fig 4 b c and e while in the low catch rate selective for carnivores coral cover remained between 30 40 fig 4 d the high biomass of browsers and grazers sustained by these fishing regimes caused in part by the release in carnivore predation pressure and partly by an optimal algal cover appears to benefit coral colonization by reducing algae cover and is the reason for the coral cover increase at the beginning of the simulations time once the dominant benthos type coral enhances fish reproduction creating a positive feedback between coral cover and fish biomass that is widely reported in the coral reef literature jones et al 2004 graham et al 2006 sandin et al 2008 this initial feedback is also responsible for sustaining high coral cover in the high frequency bleaching scenario fig 5 b which did not include any other stressors a result that suggests that the reef is able to sustain moderate levels of benthic disturbance if the frequency of disturbance does not surpass the threshold of natural variation lambert et al 2017 nevertheless the reef s capacity to cope with a new disturbance is reduced sawall et al 2013 nyström et al 2000 baker et al 2008 in the scenario combining high nutrients and high bleaching frequency fig 5 c possibly through habitat fragmentation in this scenario algae cover remains at 40 50 throughout most of the simulation time while coral cover is reduced at the beginning from 25 to about 10 but increases slowly to recover the initial 25 cover this result can be interpreted as coral taxonomic composition favouring more thermally and nutrient resistant corals alternatively model users may want to be more specific and customize coral growth rates to fit those observed in their case study benthos changes were amplified in the fish community by their feedback relationships fluctuations in mat cover produced wide variations in the biomass of bg until both stabilize by modulating one another the highest bg biomass occurred in the baseline and unselective fishing scenarios and the lowest in the selective fishing scenarios focusing all the fishing effort on carnivores reduced their biomass importantly with a subsequent release of bg from predation pressure in this case a balance is reached between mat and bg which does not give way to big fluctuations because no predation on bg means that they graze continually and mat are contained at low cover the widest amplitude in bg biomass occurred in the bleaching scenarios fig 5 and the narrowest in the selective fishing scenarios fig 4 d e bg biomass tends to stabilize around 25 30 g m 2 in all simulations consistent with biomass estimates from global data for unfished areas edwards et al 2014 scrapers biomass is quite stable and low throughout the simulated scenarios between 5 6 g m 2 these values are lower than the global 14 4 g m 2 estimated by edwards et al 2014 for unfished areas in the selective fishing scenarios their biomass is slightly higher at about 7 g m 2 once stabilized which shows that they respond to predation pressure from carnivores however it is clear that the model underestimates scraper biomass and this remains a point to be improved in the future carnivore biomass is less fluctuating than bg but responding to their variations and is maintained around 10 g m 2 in all simulations carnivore biomass is difficult to compare because it varies depending on trophic coral reef structure boaden kingsford 2015 graham et al 2017 but 10 g m 2 falls within reported values e g mccoy et al 2015 the basic model simulations suggest that a healthy coral reef may find a coral dominated equilibrium when exposed to one mild stressor if nutrients are low and there is no fishing pressure in this case the relatively mild bleaching episodes as opposed to recent catastrophic bleaching events e g hughes et al 2017 were compensated by the unaffected coral cover at depths below 10 m however the competitive advantage of corals is reduced in a scenario of combined stressors producing mat dominance of the benthos the dynamics resulting from these simulations may differ depending on the multiple context dependent characteristics considered in this model such as the total area and the depth distribution of the case study as mentioned above the goal of these simulations is to illustrate the results that seamancore can produce 3 3 model assumptions and limitations the model presented here is a simplification of a coral reef ecosystem intended to represent the processes of benthos dynamics and trophic relationships relevant to fishing yield and habitat structure within one coral reef our effort to integrate spatially explicit fish dynamics came at the expense of a simplification of coral algal demographics in comparison with other models however we expect that linking fish demographics with changing habitat quality will prove insightful for fisheries management as such model outcomes should be interpreted in the context of the underlying assumptions and the represented components and processes first seamancore represents the habitats in the fore reef and reef crest and not the lagoon or back reef and does not account for natural erosion processes and wave action we are aware that important benthic functional groups are missing from the model such as benthic invertebrates with important ecological roles sea urchins or crown of thorns starfish feeding rates can exert strong controls over the abundance of the represented benthos groups organisms which have been shown to dominate in certain phase shifts such as soft corals and sponges are included within the mat group as hard corals competitors when using field data as initial conditions for the model and other benthic invertebrates within the hard substrate type while the model could be expanded to include the specific dynamics of those organisms its current purpose is to represent competition processes between corals and its competitors given their relevance for habitat structure likewise not all corals have the same ecological functions branching corals are known to increase structural complexity and to be a preferred fish habitat while being more vulnerable to bleaching and mechanical damage grimsditch and salm 2006 baldock et al 2014 in contrast with massive corals wilson et al 2008 we averaged the growth rates of the most common species reported in some case studies of the indo pacific for the current parameterization however because of the large flexibility in community composition across coral reefs hughes et al 2012 it is important for obtaining realistic model results to derive case specific growth rate estimates according to the species composition of future study sites numerous ecological factors can influence the functional response of predators in widely diverse ways hunsicker et al 2011 that are hard to quantify and scale to entire functional groups this model does not include the effect of high predator density or the influence of seasonal patterns in water temperature on predator behaviour harborne 2012 due to a lack of mechanistic understanding in the coral reef literature stier and white 2014 we did not take into account shifts in foraging behaviour that may have been caused by predator abundance driving predator predator interactions and or antipredator behaviour in prey and had to fit the predation behaviour parameters loosely based on freshwater studies miller et al 1992 predator predator interference takes place indirectly in the migration module where habitat quality decreases for carnivorous fish with increasing congeneric density we did not delve into the effects of high prey densities in feeding rates which in some cases have been reported to decrease the feeding rate presenting a dome shaped functional response harborne 2012 jeschke et al 2004 overfishing destructive fishing and watershed pollution have been ranked as the strongest local threads faced by coral reefs around the world burke et al 2011 we chose to model them along with the largest perceived global threat i e global ocean warming however other impacts such as ocean acidification or cots outbreaks are not considered in the model additionally bleaching is assumed to occur at a fixed frequency in the form of a single event this is a gross simplification as climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of bleaching events something which other coral reef models have considered through the inclusion of published temperature projections e g ortiz et al 2014 bozec and mumby 2015 kwiatkowski et al 2015 weijerman et al 2015 ainsworth et al 2016 bozec et al 2016 the effect of land run off and pollution introducing nutrients in the system is reflected in the model by an increase in algal extension rates but not in their interaction with coral since there is no definitive evidence that nutrients increase the competitive advantage of algae e g mccook et al 2001 vermeij et al 2010 other reported effects of nutrification were not considered due to paucity in quantitative or mechanistic information available for instance terrestrial nutrients are suspected to enhance acanthaster spp larval survival pratchett et al 2014 wooldridge and brodie 2015 and to play a role in increasing the vulnerability of corals to thermal bleaching wooldridge 2016 modelling efforts such as this study would benefit from more experimental large scale field studies such as before after control impact baci experiments that gradually modify environmental factors to assess and quantify their ecosystem wide effects in detail 4 conclusions seamancore is a quantitative tool to explore potential outcomes of different resource management and environmental scenarios by simulating the dynamics of relevant coral reef functional groups the model brings together complex elements of a coral reef ecosystem in a spatially explicit setup this user friendly and computationally efficient coral reef model is intended to assist local management of coral reefs and can thus be parameterized with limited field data routinely collected in basic coral reef monitoring programs flower et al 2017 these include a greyscale bathymetric image benthic cover by group and biomass of the three functional groups appendix b in supplementary material the large variety of settings allows for substantial case study customization seamancore can be used as an exploratory tool for local management and as a tool to explore the influence of different anthropogenic stressors on the functional groups population dynamics it can be useful for testing potential synergistic effects between stressors and compare the outcomes to other models with similar scope e g gurney et al 2013 and can be used to assess whether one stressor is more detrimental than another e g nutrification vs fishing under case specific environmental conditions its menu display contains parameters that allow for the simulation of the effects of diverse fishing management strategies including fishing selectivity quotas zonation and number of fishing units it can be used to explore how a no take area or time period fisheries closure would affect the local reef seamancore s modular framework was developed to allow easy additions or
