support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request 1 introduction floods have always posed a serious threat to human survival and development as a natural disaster the frequency and damage caused by floods are increasing due to climate change and socio economic development diakakis 2014 wdowinski et al 2016 khayyam 2020 zhang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the process of flooding is complex and accurate flood forecasting is a key challenge in hydrology ranit and durge 2018 jain et al 2018 zahura and goodall 2022 uncertainty in flood forecasting arises from various aspects such as rainfall model structure model parameters etc therefore improving the accuracy of flood forecasting from these aspects has become an essential part of flood prevention and mitigation research when the hydrological model is used for flood forecasting the forecast results are influenced by several factors meresa and romanowicz 2017 among which the reasonableness of the model parameters setting has a non negligible impact on the accuracy of the forecast results benke et al 2008 the purpose of model parameter optimization is to select the best model parameters from a large number of hydrological histories to have good forecasts for most floods xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 however the hydrological model parameters determined based on historical flood rates may not adapt well to the flood forecasting task under the influence of climate change and human activities therefore the parameter optimization of the model is a vital and challenging task in flood forecasting flood processes are highly complex ambiguous and random but at the same time show their regularity cunderlik and burn 2002 sikorska et al 2015 berariu et al 2016 clustering analysis of floods to find the regularity of the same type of floods can organically combine the parameter classification debugging and flood classification forecasting as well as improve the forecast accuracy ren et al 2010 schulte 2017 and xu and peng 2015 developed new classified frameworks for flood forecasting with varying methods such as fuzzy clustering neural networks and k means clustering these classified frameworks have been found to be more accurate than traditional non classified methods rainfall is a crucial input variable for hydrological forecasting models which determine the accuracy of flood prediction many researchers have studied flood forecasting with respect to rainfall input suzana and wardah 2011 lin et al 2017 and shimizu et al 2020 have focused on modeling and using rainfall intensity data to improve flood forecasting accuracy most of these works have focused on historical rainfall runoff simulations such as the impact of uncertainty in rainfall information on the propagation of hydrological forecasts cristiano et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 ma et al 2020 however climate change and human activities have influenced the characteristics of rainfall generation and flood evolution and traditional methods are no longer adequate for flood forecasting in changing environments nguyen and chua 2012 yoon et al 2016 stein et al 2020 developed an event based flood classification methodology that is transferable across locations and provides information on all flood events including extreme ones the classification was tested and evaluated with available information and found to be mostly successful with excess rainfall being the most common dominant process the spatiotemporal characteristics of rainfall are the primary driving factors that affect flood hydrographs zheng et al 2022 pointed out that the rainfall spatiotemporal characteristic indexes rsi method is a feasible quantitative method for rainfall characteristics analysis and has potential for classifying flood types with three typical flood types being identified this study provides a reference for analyzing the driving factors of watershed flood processes hoshino and yamada 2023 proposes a spatiotemporal classification method to determine the possible patterns of heavy rainfall affecting peak discharges in rivers the proposed method uses massive ensemble rainfall datasets and identifies rainfall patterns that can be used to investigate damage scenarios and contribute to flood control planning overall these studies highlight the importance of accurate rainfall data and the need for innovative approaches in flood forecasting to account for changing environmental conditions due to a lack of information small and medium sized rivers experience complex and variable flood risk situations which often lead to inaccurate and slow selection of parameters for forecasting flood processes to further investigate the rainfall flood response relationship in data limited areas and the application of flood classification in hydrological forecasting this study proposes a method to directly identify possible flood types based on current and future rainfall conditions and select appropriate model parameters for real time flood forecasting and post processing this method can enhance the accuracy and timeliness of real time flood forecasting this paper initially performs statistical analysis and clustering of 98 historical floods in jingle basin rainfall characteristic indicators serve as precursor signals for flood identification finally flood classification forecasting is conducted using the flood type screening method based on dynamic clustering and the random forest xin anjiang flood forecasting model this method can enhance the accuracy and timeliness of real time flood forecasting which is particularly important in small and medium sized rivers that often experience complex and variable flood risk situations 2 methodology different precipitation precipitation concentration degree and concentration period have different effects on the flood process bracken et al 2008 therefore when selecting parameters for flood prediction models it is important to analyze their comprehensive effects abnormal changes and spatiotemporal changes in conjunction with underlying surface conditions this will lead to the formation of complex flood process types with specific spatiotemporal distributions resulting in changes to hydrological model parameters the present study employs big data and explainable ai to develop a new method for studying the flood generation mechanism in a basin this method only requires the low dimensional information of rainfall to interpret flood generation mechanisms from a pure data perspective the main steps of this method include pattern clustering analysis dynamic migration of model parameters and machine learning modeling see fig 1 to develop the method we utilized the k means clustering algorithm to cluster historical flood events and calibrated the model parameters for each flood type through optimization algorithms we then trained the random forest method using the rainfall corresponding to the historical flood events as the independent variable and the flood type obtained from clustering as the dependent variable this allowed us to quickly determine the possible flood types according to the rainfall and identify the corresponding model parameters for forecasting we used six indicators of rainfall signals i e total surface rainfall average rainfall intensity total rainfall duration of rainfall maximum surface rainfall intensity total surface rainfall area of watershed rainfall center of gravity rainfall duration and maximum rainfall intensity highest rainfall amount duration of rainfall at that location as original signals for flood type zheng et al 2022 the relevant rainfall statistical characteristics were taken as independent variables and the flood types obtained from clustering were taken as dependent variables we trained the model using 98 floods from 1971 to 2014 through random forests calibrated it using 68 historical floods from 1970 to 1993 and identified the flood types using 30 floods from 1994 to 2014 through random forest training we were able to quickly select the model parameters corresponding to possible flood types 2 1 k means clustering algorithm the k means clustering algorithm k means clustering algorithm chang et al 2018 is an iterative solution based clustering analysis algorithm the flood characteristics indicators such as flood duration flood peak discharge runoff depth runoff coefficient flood peak shape and peak time have implicit correlations and each indicator has a different ability and importance to portray flood events the k means clustering algorithm is used to divide the sample matrix into mutually exclusive types so that the flood event characteristics within each type are relatively close to each other the similarity of each sample to the k clustering centers is measured using the euclidean distance method the n flood events are grouped into the k clustering centers one by one until the difference between the clustering and the previous iteration is less than a certain threshold to obtain the final clustering result in each iteration the new cluster center is the mean value of the flood characteristics of all flood events in the cluster group and the objective function is to minimize the sum of squared deviations of the cluster group the number of clusters is determined by the model selection criterion bic bayesian information criterion pal et al 2013 1 bic k ln n 2 ln l where k is the number of clusters n is the number of samples and l is the model likelihood function bic introduces a penalty term related to the number of clusters which reduces the risk of overfitting by considering a reduction in the number of clusters based on an improved fit since the magnitude of each flood characteristic indicator is not uniform m flood characteristic indicators for n flood events are standardized to avoid the influence 2 y ij x ij x j σ j where x ij and y ij are the values of the j th flood characteristic index of the i th flood before and after standardization respectively x j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of the j th flood characteristic index and the correlation coefficient matrix r mm r jl mm is constructed 3 r j l i 1 p y ij y il n 1 r jl is the correlation coefficient among the flood characteristic indicators 1 l m based on the correlation coefficient matrix the eigenvalues of each flood indicator can be calculated and the cumulative variance contribution rate is further obtained by eq 4 the selection of flood characteristic indicators is determined by m k 80 and finally the sample matrix is constructed based on the selected flood characteristic indicators 4 m k i 1 k λ i i 1 m λ i λ i is the eigenvalue of each flood characteristic index m k is the cumulative variance contribution 1 k m 1 i k 2 2 random forest random forest refers to a classifier that uses multiple trees to train and predict samples and belongs to integrated learning tang et al 2020 hou et al 2021 in this study the advantages of the random forest algorithm are utilized including 1 the ability to generate highly accurate classifiers for high dimensional feature inputs while maintaining a fast and efficient training process 2 the evaluation of feature importance during category determination 3 the ability to handle missing information in the samples while still achieving high accuracy and 4 the capability to process unbalanced data and consider their interactions flood types are determined by clustering flood features and the random forest classification approach is used to associate rainfall with flood characteristics each tree is constructed according to the following algorithm 1 n is used to denote the number of historical floods samples and m denotes the number of flood event characteristics the number of input characteristics m is used to determine the decision outcome of a node on the decision tree where m should be much smaller than m 2 sampling n times from n historical flood events with put back sampling form a training set i e bootstrap sampling and using the unsampled flood events for prediction to evaluate the error 3 for each node m characteristics are randomly selected and the decision of each node in the decision tree is determined based on these characteristics based on these m characteristics the optimal split is calculated finally the trained random forest model is used to migrate for a new task to identify the flood type 2 3 xin anjiang model this study mainly emphasizes the research idea and work process of rainfall state model parameter probability forecast so the selection of hydrological model is replaceable the xin anjiang model was developed in the mid 1970 s to predict flows in the xin anjiang reservoir basin and the applicability of the model in the middle reaches of the yellow river is acceptable liu et al 2016 in this study a three source xin anjiang model containing saturated surface runoff loamy water runoff and groundwater runoff was used to simulate the runoff process in the basin due to significant changes in the underlying surface in the past few decades the non sensitive parameters such as imp of the xin anjiang model were calibrated during the model calibration phase in the context of the jingle river basin see fig s1 the model parameters are automatically optimized using the shuffle complex evolution sce ua algorithm jiang et al 2018 based on the calibration of basin observed runoff data intending to minimize the flood volume error flood peak error and maximize the efficiency factor between the model calculated outlet section flow and the measured flow the optimal parameters obtained using the historical flood are used for real time flood forecasting 2 4 model evaluation method the peak time error the relative error of peak discharge nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient pearson correlation coefficient and relative error of runoff were used to evaluate the effect of the flood prediction wan et al 2019 chen et al 2019 hu et al 2022b 1 peak time error 5 t peak t sim t obs where t peak is the error of peak

3 3 case study in this study the control area above the jingle station in loess plateau is selected as the study area see fig 2 for the location fen river basin covers an area of 39741 km2 the basin is located in a mid latitude semi humid and semi arid region with a temperate continental monsoon climate jingle station is the control station of the mainstream of the upper fen river with the drainage area of 2799 km2 located at 111 55 e 38 20 n with an average annual runoff of 152 52 m3 s the average multi year precipitation is 515 2 mm with large interannual variation in rainfall and continuous dry water conditions rainfall runoff data collected from 13 rainfall stations and 1 hydrological station between 1971 and 2014 were utilized in this study all precipitation and flow data were organized into a uniform time scale using a 1 hour time step through interception accumulation and interpolation flood events were analyzed over the statistical period of 1971 2014 and two types of indicators were collected and calculated flood causing rainfall indicators and flood characteristics indicators the flood causing rainfall indicators comprised of total rainfall average rainfall intensity maximum surface rainfall intensity rainfall center of gravity rainfall duration and maximum rainfall intensity while the flood characteristics indicators included flood duration flood peak discharge runoff depth runoff coefficient flood peak shape and peak time 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood characteristics importance identification and type classification to reduce computational complexity and time the flood characteristic indicators were ranked based on their importance and principal component analysis was used to identify the most important characteristics table 1 shows the characteristic values for each indicator it can be observed that the flood duration peak discharge and runoff depth have an importance score greater than 80 which suggests that these three indicators can be used as approximations for flood type classification flood type classification was conducted using the k means clustering algorithm by incrementally setting the number of clusters to 2 3 10 and comparing the average objective function values of the optimal clustering schemes to determine the optimal number of clusters the optimal number of clusters was determined to be 5 using the model selection criterion bic refer to fig 3 for bic scores when the number of samples is large the bic can effectively prevent overfitting caused by high model accuracy the normalized center of gravity coordinates and frequencies of each flood type after clustering are presented in table s1 the characteristics of each flood type are described below type i multi peaked floods with high rainfall long duration low rainfall intensity and a gentle flood process see fig 4 a type ii small floods with smaller rainfall longer duration lower rainfall intensities and gentler flood processes see fig 4 b type ⅲ single peaked flood with shorter duration of rainfall process and steeper flood process line see fig 4 c type ⅳ single peaked floods with small rainfall very short rainfall durations and steep flood processes see fig 4 d type v multi peaked flood with moderate rainfall long duration and flood flow in the range of 300 400 m³ s see fig 4 e the consistency between the five types of rainfall runoff processes obtained by clustering and the flood types obtained by the actual production and confluence processes can be seen in fig 4 this provides evidence for the correctness and effectiveness of the clustering method in terms of the physical mechanism of hydrological forecasting 4 2 identification of heavy rainfall and flood types and dynamic matching of parameters the historical heavy rainfall and flood data of each type were processed using the xin anjiang model to perform parameter intelligent estimation and the optimal parameters for each type of heavy rainfall and flood were obtained the random forest method was used to determine the importance of rainfall characteristics on flood types fig 5 displays the importance of average rainfall intensity and maximum hourly surface rainfall which are the two most important factors for flood types thus rainfall indicators can be used to predict the type and probability of flooding the data table 2 represents parameter values for five different flood types labeled as i ii iii iv and v some observations and comparisons that can be made from the data are the parameter values vary significantly between the different flood types for example the value of parameter k ranges from 0 305 for flood type iv to 0 606 for flood type v parameter wm which represents the maximum capacity of the watershed is highest for flood type iii and lowest for flood type ii parameter sm which represents the maximum water holding capacity of soil is highest for flood type ii and lowest for flood type iii most of the parameters have the similar value for all flood types ke which suggests that they are constant and not significantly affected by the flood type sensitive parameters such as kss and kkg which play a dominant role in determining the timing of the flooding process can have a significant impact on the resulting flood type even with small changes cristiano et al 2017 highlights the importance of accurately identifying and selecting appropriate model parameters for real time flood forecasting and post processing as inaccurate or slow parameter selection can lead to complex and variable flood risk situations in data limited areas overall the parameter values provide information about the characteristics and behavior of the different flood types by understanding the relationships between the parameters and the flood types it is possible to improve flood forecasting and management in data limited areas the results of identifying possible flood types in the verification set are presented in table s2 and fig 6 it is observed that type ii floods have the largest proportion of all flood fields with 19 occurrences accounting for 63 3 and are considered the most probable flood type in contrast type iv floods that are characterized by extreme heavy rainfall floods are unlikely to occur with only 10 possible occurrences out of 30 floods and the probabilities are all below 10 the probability of occurrence of type i and type v floods is more common at 3 and 7 times respectively while type iii floods are rare occurring only once these results validate the inverse relationship between flood intensity and frequency 4 3 ensemble forecasting drives the xin anjiang model a total of 68 historical floods that occurred in the jingle basin from 1970 to 1993 were chosen for this study the model parameters of the xin anjiang model were calibrated based on the classified flood types using the sce ua method which guarantees global search of parameters and avoids local optimum subsequently 30 floods that occurred from 1994 to 2014 were used as a test dataset and each flood was predicted with five model parameter combinations obtained from the calibration the ensemble averaging and probability weighting were used to generate seven forecast results and the forecast results for the floods that occurred on august 3 1994 july 11 1998 and august 10 2010 were examined the forecasting results as illustrated in fig 7 based on the parameter schemes obtained after calibration are not very satisfactory each parameter scheme corresponds to certain laws such as type iv flood being a rare large flood with a relatively large flood volume and peak value the error of peak time is unstable ranging from 1 to 4 h since most of the floods are type ii minor floods the flood forecasts are relatively stable with errors ranging from 18 58 19 18 when their parameter scheme is used for forecasting and the flood peaks are forecast with errors ranging from 74 19 10 37 however the ensemble processed forecasts are significantly better than the single type forecasts which reduces the forecast uncertainty considerably nevertheless the ensemble averaged forecasts may be lower than the best performing single forecasts in some indicators because the average state of all ensemble members is calculated for example the relative error of the flood peak is about 10 higher than the type i forecast scheme but the corresponding relative error of the flood volume is stable ranging from 6 95 12 03 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is approximately 0 41 0 49 the nse of the ensemble based probability weighted forecasts is 0 14 0 33 higher than that of the simple ensemble average forecasts the relative errors of flood volume and flood peak are reduced by 0 52 6 93 and 4 1 17 88 respectively and the peak time is reduced by 1 2 h this indicates that the forecast results based on type probability weighting are more accurate to the actual state of floods and can reduce the false forecast results due to type classification ambiguity the ensemble based probability weighted forecasts perform better in reducing forecast uncertainty and improving robustness this conclusion is similar to the studies of liang et al 2010 and yan and moradkhani 2016 on synthetic forecasting of hydrological models three floods namely 19940803 19980711 and 20100810 were selected for testing the forecast the optimal model parameters obtained from the calibration of each type of flood were selected as the ensemble members for each flood for each moment of the flood forecast the maximum and minimum values of the ensemble members were used to determine the upper and lower bounds of the possible flood forecasts represented as gray intervals in fig 8 according to fig 8 the forecasted values of the floods and the measured flow processes exhibit better agreement overall when using the calibrated parameters after the classification of historical flood types comparing the ensemble average flood process line the flood forecast results based on the probability weighting of flood types are more accurate and satisfactory the simulated flood peaks in the forecasts for the two medium sized floods namely 19940803 and 19980711 are closer to the actual conditions however for the 20100810 flood event with a low flow state the ensemble average results perform better the entire flood forecasting scheme is characterized by the early occurrence of flood peaks and underestimation of peak discharge which may be attributed to the poor ability of the model parameters to generalize extreme conditions and the failure to consider the state of the basin subsurface before rainfall hu et al 2022a table s3 summarizes the test indicators of the forecast results for each scheme it is observed that the flood forecast values using scheme iv are generally high and the peak time is early although the model parameters of this scheme reflect some characteristics of extreme floods the flood peaks are largely far from the actual measured flood peaks compared to other forecast schemes the special conditions of the flood peaks cannot be well estimated leading to an increase in peak time error by 1 2 h the ensemble averaging results of each scheme effectively correct the degree of deviation of the flood peak and flood volume however some flood extremes are filtered during the process of averaging the ensemble forecast members thereby impacting the predicted flood peak with a large deviation consequently the relative error of the flood peak ranges from 53 06 to 23 83 nonetheless comparing the ensemble averaged and probability weighted results the relative errors of the flood volume for the probability weighted forecasts range from 13 92 17 12 whereas the relative errors of the flood volume for the ensemble averaged forecasts range from 6 95 12 03 different ensemble prediction post processing methods have varied improvement effects on different prediction result indices qu et al 2017 he et al 2009 the accuracy of flood forecasting and flood control scheduling in the jingle basin has been improved by considering flood type classification and rainfall characteristics identification the results obtained from the ensemble forecasting based on the probability of the flood type have been found to be more accurate and satisfactory in predicting the characteristics of floods table s2 summarizes the accuracy evaluation indexes for each scheme and shows that the ensemble averaging results are significantly better in terms of relative errors of flood volume but slightly worse than the probability weighted forecasts in other indexes the use of the probability of the type of flood to weight the forecasts is more effective in accurately predicting the characteristics of floods particularly in numerical correction of flood peak and flood volume and for prediction of the process line and peak time this finding is in agreement with a previous study which demonstrated that the ensemble forecasting method is typically more resilient than single member forecasting but may not consistently outperform all individual forecasting members shimizu et al 2020 li et al 2017 the study provides new insights into the parameter selection of flood forecasting and flood control scheduling and has the potential to improve flood management in the jingle basin 5 conclusion it has been found that there are five typical response relationships between flood processes and basin rainfall which indicate five common basin scale storm flood types furthermore it has been observed that the different patterns of storm flood types have a significant impact on flood forecast errors the new method described in this study utilizes only low dimensional information of rainfall and is capable of decoding and forecasting flood production mechanisms from a purely data driven perspective this greatly reduces the data requirements and subjectivity associated with traditional forecasting methods model parameters can be adjusted based on new rainfall dynamics data to enable intelligent hydrological forecasting in changing environments in summary the main conclusions of this study are as follows in this study three flood indicators namely flood duration peak discharge and runoff depth were identified as the most important factors characterizing flooding while average rainfall intensity and maximum hourly surface rainfall were found to be the primary indicators of the type of storm flooding based on these findings a flood forecasting model was developed for the jingle basin using rainfall characteristic indicators the model provides a scientific basis for fast flood forecasting and warning in the basin which can be particularly useful in situations where data requirements and subjectivity of traditional forecasting methods are high the results of the proposed method showed that it can effectively simulate the flood process with better flood forecasting results obtained using probabilistic integration as compared to ensemble averaging however peak forecast values for extreme heavy rainfall floods tend to be smaller the next step in this research is to validate the proposed method in other basins and explore how different rainfall processes affect runoff production to improve the accuracy of runoff forecasting the effects of different rainfall processes on runoff production can have significant differences there is a need to separate the rainfall process types and the fall zone to select suitable parameters for runoff forecasting models to improve accuracy by using the model parameters of possible flood types that correspond to rainfall states to drive the flood forecasting model a new set of ideas and methods can be provided for basin flood control this can aid in quickly assessing the impact of rainfall on basin flood risk and can be applied to rapid flood warning the reliability of the model can be further improved by considering rainfall patterns and surface conditions at a later stage a combination of physics based modeling and machine learning ml can create more accurate and scalable flood models in practical environments

precipitation precipitation concentration degree and concentration period have different effects on the flood process bracken et al 2008 therefore when selecting parameters for flood prediction models it is important to analyze their comprehensive effects abnormal changes and spatiotemporal changes in conjunction with underlying surface conditions this will lead to the formation of complex flood process types with specific spatiotemporal distributions resulting in changes to hydrological model parameters the present study employs big data and explainable ai to develop a new method for studying the flood generation mechanism in a basin this method only requires the low dimensional information of rainfall to interpret flood generation mechanisms from a pure data perspective the main steps of this method include pattern clustering analysis dynamic migration of model parameters and machine learning modeling see fig 1 to develop the method we utilized the k means clustering algorithm to cluster historical flood events and calibrated the model parameters for each flood type through optimization algorithms we then trained the random forest method using the rainfall corresponding to the historical flood events as the independent variable and the flood type obtained from clustering as the dependent variable this allowed us to quickly determine the possible flood types according to the rainfall and identify the corresponding model parameters for forecasting we used six indicators of rainfall signals i e total surface rainfall average rainfall intensity total rainfall duration of rainfall maximum surface rainfall intensity total surface rainfall area of watershed rainfall center of gravity rainfall duration and maximum rainfall intensity highest rainfall amount duration of rainfall at that location as original signals for flood type zheng et al 2022 the relevant rainfall statistical characteristics were taken as independent variables and the flood types obtained from clustering were taken as dependent variables we trained the model using 98 floods from 1971 to 2014 through random forests calibrated it using 68 historical floods from 1970 to 1993 and identified the flood types using 30 floods from 1994 to 2014 through random forest training we were able to quickly select the model parameters corresponding to possible flood types 2 1 k means clustering algorithm the k means clustering algorithm k means clustering algorithm chang et al 2018 is an iterative solution based clustering analysis algorithm the flood characteristics indicators such as flood duration flood peak discharge runoff depth runoff coefficient flood peak shape and peak time have implicit correlations and each indicator has a different ability and importance to portray flood events the k means clustering algorithm is used to divide the sample matrix into mutually exclusive types so that the flood event characteristics within each type are relatively close to each other the similarity of each sample to the k clustering centers is measured using the euclidean distance method the n flood events are grouped into the k clustering centers one by one until the difference between the clustering and the previous iteration is less than a certain threshold to obtain the final clustering result in each iteration the new cluster center is the mean value of the flood characteristics of all flood events in the cluster group and the objective function is to minimize the sum of squared deviations of the cluster group the number of clusters is determined by the model selection criterion bic bayesian information criterion pal et al 2013 1 bic k ln n 2 ln l where k is the number of clusters n is the number of samples and l is the model likelihood function bic introduces a penalty term related to the number of clusters which reduces the risk of overfitting by considering a reduction in the number of clusters based on an improved fit since the magnitude of each flood characteristic indicator is not uniform m flood characteristic indicators for n flood events are standardized to avoid the influence 2 y ij x ij x j σ j where x ij and y ij are the values of the j th flood characteristic index of the i th flood before and after standardization respectively x j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of the j th flood characteristic index and the correlation coefficient matrix r mm r jl mm is constructed 3 r j l i 1 p y ij y il n 1 r jl is the correlation coefficient among the flood characteristic indicators 1 l m based on the correlation coefficient matrix the eigenvalues of each flood indicator can be calculated and the cumulative variance contribution rate is further obtained by eq 4 the selection of flood characteristic indicators is determined by m k 80 and finally the sample matrix is constructed based on the selected flood characteristic indicators 4 m k i 1 k λ i i 1 m λ i λ i is the eigenvalue of each flood characteristic index m k is the cumulative variance contribution 1 k m 1 i k 2 2 random forest random forest refers to a classifier that uses multiple trees to train and predict samples and belongs to integrated learning tang et al 2020 hou et al 2021 in this study the advantages of the random forest algorithm are utilized including 1 the ability to generate highly accurate classifiers for high dimensional feature inputs while maintaining a fast and efficient training process 2 the evaluation of feature importance during category determination 3 the ability to handle missing information in the samples while still achieving high accuracy and 4 the capability to process unbalanced data and consider their interactions flood types are determined by clustering flood features and the random forest classification approach is used to associate rainfall with flood characteristics each tree is constructed according to the following algorithm 1 n is used to denote the number of historical floods samples and m denotes the number of flood event characteristics the number of input characteristics m is used to determine the decision outcome of a node on the decision tree where m should be much smaller than m 2 sampling n times from n historical flood events with put back sampling form a training set i e bootstrap sampling and using the unsampled flood events for prediction to evaluate the error 3 for each node m characteristics are randomly selected and the decision of each node in the decision tree is determined based on these characteristics based on these m characteristics the optimal split is calculated finally the trained random forest model is used to migrate for a new task to identify the flood type 2 3 xin anjiang model this study mainly emphasizes the research idea and work process of rainfall state model parameter probability forecast so the selection of hydrological model is replaceable the xin anjiang model was developed in the mid 1970 s to predict flows in the xin anjiang reservoir basin and the applicability of the model in the middle reaches of the yellow river is acceptable liu et al 2016 in this study a three source xin anjiang model containing saturated surface runoff loamy water runoff and groundwater runoff was used to simulate the runoff process in the basin due to significant changes in the underlying surface in the past few decades the non sensitive parameters such as imp of the xin anjiang model were calibrated during the model calibration phase in the context of the jingle river basin see fig s1 the model parameters are automatically optimized using the shuffle complex evolution sce ua algorithm jiang et al 2018 based on the calibration of basin observed runoff data intending to minimize the flood volume error flood peak error and maximize the efficiency factor between the model calculated outlet section flow and the measured flow the optimal parameters obtained using the historical flood are used for real time flood forecasting 2 4 model evaluation method the peak time error the relative error of peak discharge nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient pearson correlation coefficient and relative error of runoff were used to evaluate the effect of the flood prediction wan et al 2019 chen et al 2019 hu et al 2022b 1 peak time error 5 t peak t sim t obs where t peak is the error of peak

3 3 case study in this study the control area above the jingle station in loess plateau is selected as the study area see fig 2 for the location fen river basin covers an area of 39741 km2 the basin is located in a mid latitude semi humid and semi arid region with a temperate continental monsoon climate jingle station is the control station of the mainstream of the upper fen river with the drainage area of 2799 km2 located at 111 55 e 38 20 n with an average annual runoff of 152 52 m3 s the average multi year precipitation is 515 2 mm with large interannual variation in rainfall and continuous dry water conditions rainfall runoff data collected from 13 rainfall stations and 1 hydrological station between 1971 and 2014 were utilized in this study all precipitation and flow data were organized into a uniform time scale using a 1 hour time step through interception accumulation and interpolation flood events were analyzed over the statistical period of 1971 2014 and two types of indicators were collected and calculated flood causing rainfall indicators and flood characteristics indicators the flood causing rainfall indicators comprised of total rainfall average rainfall intensity maximum surface rainfall intensity rainfall center of gravity rainfall duration and maximum rainfall intensity while the flood characteristics indicators included flood duration flood peak discharge runoff depth runoff coefficient flood peak shape and peak time 4 results and discussion 4 1 flood characteristics importance identification and type classification to reduce computational complexity and time the flood characteristic indicators were ranked based on their importance and principal component analysis was used to identify the most important characteristics table 1 shows the characteristic values for each indicator it can be observed that the flood duration peak discharge and runoff depth have an importance score greater than 80 which suggests that these three indicators can be used as approximations for flood type classification flood type classification was conducted using the k means clustering algorithm by incrementally setting the number of clusters to 2 3 10 and comparing the average objective function values of the optimal clustering schemes to determine the optimal number of clusters the optimal number of clusters was determined to be 5 using the model selection criterion bic refer to fig 3 for bic scores when the number of samples is large the bic can effectively prevent overfitting caused by high model accuracy the normalized center of gravity coordinates and frequencies of each flood type after clustering are presented in table s1 the characteristics of each flood type are described below type i multi peaked floods with high rainfall long duration low rainfall intensity and a gentle flood process see fig 4 a type ii small floods with smaller rainfall longer duration lower rainfall intensities and gentler flood processes see fig 4 b type ⅲ single peaked flood with shorter duration of rainfall process and steeper flood process line see fig 4 c type ⅳ single peaked floods with small rainfall very short rainfall durations and steep flood processes see fig 4 d type v multi peaked flood with moderate rainfall long duration and flood flow in the range of 300 400 m³ s see fig 4 e the consistency between the five types of rainfall runoff processes obtained by clustering and the flood types obtained by the actual production and confluence processes can be seen in fig 4 this provides evidence for the correctness and effectiveness of the clustering method in terms of the physical mechanism of hydrological forecasting 4 2 identification of heavy rainfall and flood types and dynamic matching of parameters the historical heavy rainfall and flood data of each type were processed using the xin anjiang model to perform parameter intelligent estimation and the optimal parameters for each type of heavy rainfall and flood were obtained the random forest method was used to determine the importance of rainfall characteristics on flood types fig 5 displays the importance of average rainfall intensity and maximum hourly surface rainfall which are the two most important factors for flood types thus rainfall indicators can be used to predict the type and probability of flooding the data table 2 represents parameter values for five different flood types labeled as i ii iii iv and v some observations and comparisons that can be made from the data are the parameter values vary significantly between the different flood types for example the value of parameter k ranges from 0 305 for flood type iv to 0 606 for flood type v parameter wm which represents the maximum capacity of the watershed is highest for flood type iii and lowest for flood type ii parameter sm which represents the maximum water holding capacity of soil is highest for flood type ii and lowest for flood type iii most of the parameters have the similar value for all flood types ke which suggests that they are constant and not significantly affected by the flood type sensitive parameters such as kss and kkg which play a dominant role in determining the timing of the flooding process can have a significant impact on the resulting flood type even with small changes cristiano et al 2017 highlights the importance of accurately identifying and selecting appropriate model parameters for real time flood forecasting and post processing as inaccurate or slow parameter selection can lead to complex and variable flood risk situations in data limited areas overall the parameter values provide information about the characteristics and behavior of the different flood types by understanding the relationships between the parameters and the flood types it is possible to improve flood forecasting and management in data limited areas the results of identifying possible flood types in the verification set are presented in table s2 and fig 6 it is observed that type ii floods have the largest proportion of all flood fields with 19 occurrences accounting for 63 3 and are considered the most probable flood type in contrast type iv floods that are characterized by extreme heavy rainfall floods are unlikely to occur with only 10 possible occurrences out of 30 floods and the probabilities are all below 10 the probability of occurrence of type i and type v floods is more common at 3 and 7 times respectively while type iii floods are rare occurring only once these results validate the inverse relationship between flood intensity and frequency 4 3 ensemble forecasting drives the xin anjiang model a total of 68 historical floods that occurred in the jingle basin from 1970 to 1993 were chosen for this study the model parameters of the xin anjiang model were calibrated based on the classified flood types using the sce ua method which guarantees global search of parameters and avoids local optimum subsequently 30 floods that occurred from 1994 to 2014 were used as a test dataset and each flood was predicted with five model parameter combinations obtained from the calibration the ensemble averaging and probability weighting were used to generate seven forecast results and the forecast results for the floods that occurred on august 3 1994 july 11 1998 and august 10 2010 were examined the forecasting results as illustrated in fig 7 based on the parameter schemes obtained after calibration are not very satisfactory each parameter scheme corresponds to certain laws such as type iv flood being a rare large flood with a relatively large flood volume and peak value the error of peak time is unstable ranging from 1 to 4 h since most of the floods are type ii minor floods the flood forecasts are relatively stable with errors ranging from 18 58 19 18 when their parameter scheme is used for forecasting and the flood peaks are forecast with errors ranging from 74 19 10 37 however the ensemble processed forecasts are significantly better than the single type forecasts which reduces the forecast uncertainty considerably nevertheless the ensemble averaged forecasts may be lower than the best performing single forecasts in some indicators because the average state of all ensemble members is calculated for example the relative error of the flood peak is about 10 higher than the type i forecast scheme but the corresponding relative error of the flood volume is stable ranging from 6 95 12 03 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is approximately 0 41 0 49 the nse of the ensemble based probability weighted forecasts is 0 14 0 33 higher than that of the simple ensemble average forecasts the relative errors of flood volume and flood peak are reduced by 0 52 6 93 and 4 1 17 88 respectively and the peak time is reduced by 1 2 h this indicates that the forecast results based on type probability weighting are more accurate to the actual state of floods and can reduce the false forecast results due to type classification ambiguity the ensemble based probability weighted forecasts perform better in reducing forecast uncertainty and improving robustness this conclusion is similar to the studies of liang et al 2010 and yan and moradkhani 2016 on synthetic forecasting of hydrological models three floods namely 19940803 19980711 and 20100810 were selected for testing the forecast the optimal model parameters obtained from the calibration of each type of flood were selected as the ensemble members for each flood for each moment of the flood forecast the maximum and minimum values of the ensemble members were used to determine the upper and lower bounds of the possible flood forecasts represented as gray intervals in fig 8 according to fig 8 the forecasted values of the floods and the measured flow processes exhibit better agreement overall when using the calibrated parameters after the classification of historical flood types comparing the ensemble average flood process line the flood forecast results based on the probability weighting of flood types are more accurate and satisfactory the simulated flood peaks in the forecasts for the two medium sized floods namely 19940803 and 19980711 are closer to the actual conditions however for the 20100810 flood event with a low flow state the ensemble average results perform better the entire flood forecasting scheme is characterized by the early occurrence of flood peaks and underestimation of peak discharge which may be attributed to the poor ability of the model parameters to generalize extreme conditions and the failure to consider the state of the basin subsurface before rainfall hu et al 2022a table s3 summarizes the test indicators of the forecast results for each scheme it is observed that the flood forecast values using scheme iv are generally high and the peak time is early although the model parameters of this scheme reflect some characteristics of extreme floods the flood peaks are largely far from the actual measured flood peaks compared to other forecast schemes the special conditions of the flood peaks cannot be well estimated leading to an increase in peak time error by 1 2 h the ensemble averaging results of each scheme effectively correct the degree of deviation of the flood peak and flood volume however some flood extremes are filtered during the process of averaging the ensemble forecast members thereby impacting the predicted flood peak with a large deviation consequently the relative error of the flood peak ranges from 53 06 to 23 83 nonetheless comparing the ensemble averaged and probability weighted results the relative errors of the flood volume for the probability weighted forecasts range from 13 92 17 12 whereas the relative errors of the flood volume for the ensemble averaged forecasts range from 6 95 12 03 different ensemble prediction post processing methods have varied improvement effects on different prediction result indices qu et al 2017 he et al 2009 the accuracy of flood forecasting and flood control scheduling in the jingle basin has been improved by considering flood type classification and rainfall characteristics identification the results obtained from the ensemble forecasting based on the probability of the flood type have been found to be more accurate and satisfactory in predicting the characteristics of floods table s2 summarizes the accuracy evaluation indexes for each scheme and shows that the ensemble averaging results are significantly better in terms of relative errors of flood volume but slightly worse than the probability weighted forecasts in other indexes the use of the probability of the type of flood to weight the forecasts is more effective in accurately predicting the characteristics of floods particularly in numerical correction of flood peak and flood volume and for prediction of the process line and peak time this finding is in agreement with a previous study which demonstrated that the ensemble forecasting method is typically more resilient than single member forecasting but may not consistently outperform all individual forecasting members shimizu et al 2020 li et al 2017 the study provides new insights into the parameter selection of flood forecasting and flood control scheduling and has the potential to improve flood management in the jingle basin 5 conclusion it has been found that there are five typical response relationships between flood processes and basin rainfall which indicate five common basin scale storm flood types furthermore it has been observed that the different patterns of storm flood types have a significant impact on flood forecast errors the new method described in this study utilizes only low dimensional information of rainfall and is capable of decoding and forecasting flood production mechanisms from a purely data driven perspective this greatly reduces the data requirements and subjectivity associated with traditional forecasting methods model parameters can be adjusted based on new rainfall dynamics data to enable intelligent hydrological forecasting in changing environments in summary the main conclusions of this study are as follows in this study three flood indicators namely flood duration peak discharge and runoff depth were identified as the most important factors characterizing flooding while average rainfall intensity and maximum hourly surface rainfall were found to be the primary indicators of the type of storm flooding based on these findings a flood forecasting model was developed for the jingle basin using rainfall characteristic indicators the model provides a scientific basis for fast flood forecasting and warning in the basin which can be particularly useful in situations where data requirements and subjectivity of traditional forecasting methods are high the results of the proposed method showed that it can effectively simulate the flood process with better flood forecasting results obtained using probabilistic integration as compared to ensemble averaging however peak forecast values for extreme heavy rainfall floods tend to be smaller the next step in this research is to validate the proposed method in other basins and explore how different rainfall processes affect runoff production to improve the accuracy of runoff forecasting the effects of different rainfall processes on runoff production can have significant differences there is a need to separate the rainfall process types and the fall zone to select suitable parameters for runoff forecasting models to improve accuracy by using the model parameters of possible flood types that correspond to rainfall states to drive the flood forecasting model a new set of ideas and methods can be provided for basin flood control this can aid in quickly assessing the impact of rainfall on basin flood risk and can be applied to rapid flood warning the reliability of the model can be further improved by considering rainfall patterns and surface conditions at a later stage a combination of physics based modeling and machine learning ml can create more accurate and scalable flood models in practical environments

7671,study region zohreh river basin southwest iran study focus the salinity of zohreh river sharply increases in three salinity zones szs along the river named sz1 sz2 the focus of this study and sz3 determining the salinity sources and salinization mechanism using an integrated approach including geological hydrochemical isotopic geophysical river sinuosity and hydrocarbon analysis are the main objectives of this study the study focuses on the combination of evidence of regional scale i e river sinuosity and seismic data and small scale i e drilling core analysis new hydrologic insights for the region among several known sources of river salinity it was found that the water quality of the zohreh river is mainly threatened by the salt bearing gachsaran formation and oil field brine it is concluded that halite brine and oil field brine simultaneously cause the salinization in sz2 and their contributions were delineated to be 95 and 5 respectively the lack of reliable geological evidence to support halite dissolution in surficial layers by circulating waters suggests the possibility of a deep source of halite brine in sz2 the results revealed that deep halite brine of the salt layers of gachsaran formation is mainly responsible for the salinization of sz2 the mechanism of deep brine penetration to the river through the hidden fault failures detected by the combination of river sinuosity analysis and geophysical data for the first time graphical abstract ga1 keywords river salinity salinization mechanism isotope halite brine river sinuosity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction worldwide many societies rely on rivers for water supply in addition to the availability of water water quality needs to be considered as well since it can restrict the use of water resources for drinking irrigation and industrial uses in many regions vengosh 2014 understanding the controls on river quality is crucial for preserving vital water resources in the regions facing water scarcity the foremost issue which threatens the chemical quality of natural waters in many arid and semiarid regions is salinity el ashry et al 1985 natural

interaction membrane filtration and evaporation can alter the original chemical and isotopic composition of the salinity sources discerning the origin of salinity is challenging mirzavand et al 2020 the situation is compounded by the fact that in many cases different sources of salinity simultaneously deteriorate the water quality in combination with other types of pollution including organic and inorganic contaminants detrimental to both humans and the environment eissa 2018 kouchekzadeh and zarei 2017 mohammadi et al 2012 vangosh 2014 vangosh et al 2002 gharaat et al 2022 naturally and or

nested basins affected by a combination of pollution and salinity sources including the salt bearing gachsaran formation covering a significant portion of the river basin agricultural lands municipal and industrial waste and effluents aquaculture ponds and oil field reservoirs ahmadee et al 2016 chitsazan et al 2012 khodadadi dehkordi and kashkuli 2015 mohammadi behzad et al 2016 ravanbakhsh et al 2019 valiallahi and khaffaf roudy 2021 the zohreh river is an important source of water in a hot and semiarid region for several purposes including potable water irrigation aquaculture industrial and recreational uses moreover several dams e g sheshpir parsian chamshir shiv kowsar are being constructed or planned along this river therefore monitoring and understanding the controls on water quality of this river is required for public health and sustainability 24 year 1977 2020 monthly water quality data recorded by the fars regional water authority frwa shows that electrical conductivity ec of the zohreh river as an indicator of water salinity increases gradually from the head waters to its mouth average ec values of the zohreh river from the head water to downstream waters during the dry season are plotted along the river course at the stations labeled g1 to g22 in fig 2 three major salinity zones szs here after named sz1 sz2 and sz3 can be highlighted in fig 2 along the zohreh river in which the water salinity increases stepwise a number of studies have been conducted in order to determine causes of local increments in salinity of the river ario behin tarh consulting engineering

tscec and parab fars consulting engineering company pfcec 1997 tehran university 2018 a significant part of sz1 is covered with evaporitic sediments of the early miocene gachsaran formation including halite and gypsum minerals dissolution of such minerals by surface runoff and those infiltrated waters that ends up in the base flow has been introduced as the cause of salinization in sz1 in the report by tscec and pfcec 1997 ec of the river water in sz1 variates between 46 000 and 61 000 µs cm 1 with average discharge of 0 7 m3 s 1 measured at g4 mixing with other fresh tributaries and

as 2260 and 5700 µs cm 1 respectively discharge of the brines along the river banks account for the salinization of the zohreh river passing through sz3 although there is a disagreement with regard to the source of these brines different sources have been reported for the saline brines in previous studies including 1 a mixture of deep oil field brines and halite dissolution sapcec 2012 2 halite

received the least attention in previous studies and therefore we focused on sz2 in this study from the confluence of fahaliyan and shiv rivers g11 to the outlet of murd anticline g13 the salinity of zohreh river gradually declines due to mixing with fresh karst water but then rises sharply due to the influence of sz2 when the flow rate of the river drops to less than 10 m3 s 1 during summers ec of the river water increases from the average value of 1095 to 1830 µs cm 1 over a distance of just about 500 m tehran university 2018 at this distance some discharging brines in the form of springs or seeps can be observed and detected near the river on the banksides but the saline springs seeps are not visible except in summers and become concealed below the river flow during wet seasons since sz2 will be submerged by the chamshir reservoir after impoundment it may play a vital role in the water quality of the reservoir and should be taken into consideration the main objectives of this

iranian oil company south oilfields nisoc 2022 the sequence of geological formations in the study area is presented in fig s1 in the supplementary material sm section based on geological and geophysical data the study area is affected by the basement rooted thrust faults e g mountain frontal flexure mff and dej soleiman thrust causing structural complexity alavi 2007 since detecting faults is challenging in geological formations with plastic behavior e g gachsaran formation sinuosity analysis of the river was used in this research as an approach in order to detect the concealed faults that have no surficial evidence this method is described in the following sections 2 3 water samples and analyses to understand the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the study area i e sz2 sampling of a diverse set of water resources was conducted in two temporal stages in august and october 2020 these water resources include 6 river samples labelled as r in figs 3 7 spring seep samples labelled as s in figs 3 and 4 borehole samples labelled as bh in fig 3 i e bh11 bh12 bh13 and bh14 with final depth of 80 100 61 and 38 m respectively since the springs seeps are only visible during the dry season this is the only period when water sampling is possible and during the rest of the year they are hidden under the raised river level and cannot be sampled the river samples were collected along the zohreh river from upstream of sz2 to downstream at sz3 water samples of the boreholes drilled within sz2 were collected only in the second stage of sampling some seeps were dried out in the second stage of sampling and it was not possible to collect samples all water samples were analyzed for major ions including na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 and a select number of samples were analyzed for minor ions including li b br sr2 i and ba2 and stable isotopes including δ2h δ18o 87sr 86sr δ37cl and δ81br the ec and temperature were measured on site using a portable eutech p450 ec meter all water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm filters except the samples used for measuring major ions and the samples were stored in a cooler until delivered to the laboratory the samples specified for measuring minor ions were collected in dark polyethylene bottles for cation analyses the samples were acidified to a ph less than 2 using concentrated nitric acid 65 hno3 in order to prevent complexation and precipitation of dissolved constituents non acidified samples were allocated to anion and stable isotope analyses the concentrations of major and minor ions were analyzed using ion chromatography at shiraz university central laboratory iran and hydroisotop gmbh germany respectively except for bicarbonate analyzed by titration to evaluate the accuracy of the measurements the ionic balance error ibe was calculated to be less than 5 the water samples for measuring δ18o and δ2h were sealed after filtration in order to avoid any exchange with the atmosphere δ2h δ18o δ37cl and δ81br were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms and 87sr 86sr using mass spectrometry tims at hydroisotop gmbh germany 2 4 solid samples and analyses 2 4 1 sediment samples since the gachsaran oil field is partly located in the study area it is likely to be a potential source of pollution evidence of seepage of hydrocarbon substances can be traced in the sediments as these materials can accumulate in the solid phase hence four sediment samples were collected from the outlets of springs seeps in the second stage of sampling in order to analyze hydrocarbon contents labelled as sed in fig 3 for measuring total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs and poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs sediment samples were placed in pre cleaned bottles wrapped with aluminum foil stored in cool box in temperature less than 4 c and kept frozen 20 c until analysis tphs and pahs were analyzed as previously described by araghi et al 2014 2 4 2 core samples although the gachsaran formation is widely extended over the study area no salt layer is exposed in the region in order to examine the existence of any salt layer at shallow depths beneath the surface seven boreholes i e bh11 to bh17 were drilled to the maximum depth of 120 m in and around sz2 bh11 and bh 12 were drilled in sz2 adjacent to the saline seeps while bh13 and bh 14 were drilled in upstream of sz2 to provide data for comparison with sz2 bh15 to bh17 had been drilled in an earlier study by sabir company 2020 and only their data was used in this study the locations of these boreholes are presented in fig 3 in order to determine the mineralogical composition of the rock layers a number of core samples from the boreholes were collected the core samples from depths likely to contain salt were separated for xrd analysis in addition to compare the mineralogical compositions of rock layers between sz2 and sz3 the core samples of boreholes drilled in sz3 in which salt stone had been detected were also analyzed the core samples were pulverized using a puck mill and then analyzed by bruker axs d8advance for xrd analysis at azarin zaminazma surena lab iran to address the dynamics of the water rock interaction 50 g of pulverized core samples were mixed into 250 ml of distilled water and stirred for 2 h ec of the mixtures were measured in 0 5 1 2 24 and 48 h after mixing the ultimate ec values were also predicted using phreeqc a geochemical modeling software developed by united states geological survey parkhurst and appelo 2013 for the thermodynamic equilibrium status after 48 h the obtained extracts were separated from undissolved remains by paper filters and analyzed for hydrochemical composition the hydrochemical compositions of the extracts from the core samples with a high percentage of halite were used as the halite solution end member s composition in determining salinity sources 2 5 sinuosity analysis in order to discover the hidden geological structures of the study area that control the groundwater flow and salinization mechanism river sinuosity analysis was conducted rivers have self organizing behavior to maintain their default slope of the riverbed any small change in topographic elevation affects the sinuosity of a low gradient river holbrook and schumm 1999 hence the faults with vertical movements lead to variation of the channel sinuosity value this theory has been tested in past research and led to reliable results petrovszki et al 2012 timár 2003 woolderink et al 2021 zámolyi et al 2010 therefore sinuosity analysis can be an effective method to discover the hidden faults with vertical movements in low relief lands with homogeneous lithology and low gradient classic sinuosity index si represents the river sinuosity which is equal to the ratio of the along channel distance to the straight path length since the river sinuosity is scale dependent si should be calculated and analyzed in various window sizes in this research the si values of the zohreh river were measured using window sizes of 500 1000 1500 2000 3000 4000 and 5000 m as described previously by zámolyi et al 2010 3 results and discussion the results of water sample analyses presented in table s1 in sm section show that all water types in the study area are na cl and in saline water resources which show a higher ec i e saline springs seeps the contribution of these two dominant ions is relatively higher comparing the hydrochemical composition of the water samples in two sampling periods does not show any significant change springs seeps inside sz2 i e s1 s2 and s3 and the water samples taken from boreholes drilled in this zone i e bh11 and bh12 show similar compositions however the boreholes drilled outside of sz2 i e bh13 and bh14 have different hydrochemical compositions even though both groups of boreholes were drilled in the same formation on the riverbank at a distance of approximately 3 km average tds abruptly increased from 1013 mg l 1 in r2 to 1289 mg l 1 in r4 which shows the influence of sz2 in the salinization of the zohreh river other parameters including ec and cl na so4 2 and br concentrations present almost the same increasing trend the total discharge rate of springs seeps in this zone 6 l s 1 with weighted average tds of 144 617 mg l 1 is not sufficient to raise the salinity of the river with a measured discharge of 7 9 and 8 5 m3 s 1 at the first and second time of sampling respectively it seems that a significant volume of the brine is discharged through the riverbed in form of seepage which is not visible the mass balance equation based on the changes in tds cl na so4 2 and br concentrations before and after sz2 suggests that an unknown brine with an average discharge rate of 59 l s 1 and average tds of 110 g l 1 is responsible for the rise of salinity along sz2 possible salinity sources are assessed in the following section 3 1 potential salinity sources the salinity sources of groundwater in general include evaporation oil field brines seawater intrusion deep basin brines and geothermal waters halite dissolution and road salt zarei et al 2013 due to the natural dominant conditions in the study area some of these sources could be ignored the plausible salinity sources in the study area include halite dissolution oil field brines and evaporation the evaporative minerals included in the gachsaran formation like halite can be a potential source of salinity the gachsaran oil field is partly extended beneath the study area which confirms the possibility of oil field brines presence in depth although the climate of the study area is hot and semi arid and the average potential evaporation was measured as 2042 mm mgcec 2011a 2011b 2011c evaporation is not likely as a potential salinity source due to 1 the lack of reservoir or surface water body and 2 the lack of permanent aquifer and groundwater level near the ground surface 3 1 1 gachsaran salt the drilling data were investigated to find out whether the gachsaran formation contains halite that could cause salinization in the study area the outcome of drillings in the gachsaran formation inside sz2 i e bh11 and bh12 with final depth of 80 and 100 m respectively and outside sz2 i e bh13 and bh14 with final depth of 61 and 38 m respectively revealed that limestone gypsum and marl deposits are the main components of rock layers in these locations and as opposed to what was expected no salt layer was detected inside sz2 during excavations based on drilling logs the lithology of the boreholes inside sz2 compared to the ones outside sz2 is relatively similar however the hydrochemical characteristics of the water samples taken from these boreholes are different the measured ec values of water samples taken from bh11 and bh12 are 165 200 and 144 600 µs cm 1 and their cl concentrations are 152 079 and 141 554 ppm respectively the ec values for bh13 and bh14 are 11 170 and 23 800 µs cm 1 and their cl concentrations are 3878 and 10 479 ppm respectively xrd analyses showed that constituent minerals of the core samples include chlorite illite quartz halite gypsum anhydrite calcite dolomite and aragonite the mineralogical compositions of the core samples are presented in fig 4 despite the high ec values of the water samples taken from the boreholes inside sz2 i e bh11 and bh12 the salt content of the core samples pertaining to these boreholes is not significant up to 3 the measured and modeled ec values of the extracts of the core samples are presented in table s2 in sm section and fig 4 which show that the ec of the extracts pertaining to the saline boreholes i e bh11 and bh12 even after reaching the thermodynamic equilibrium condition cannot record values greater than 14 451 µs cm 1 furthermore the ec values of the core samples taken from bh13 and bh14 are approximately similar to those of the saline boreholes therefore the surficial lithology of gachsaran formation cannot be responsible for the salinization in sz2 it seems that the saline brine migrated to this zone from elsewhere according to the oil well drilling logs reported by the national iranian oil company nioc member 4 of the gachsaran formation includes a significant thickness of salt which is important as a potential source of salinity given that salt samples of gachsaran member 4 or the halite brine resulting from this member were not available the core samples comprised of salt in the boreholes of sz3 i e bh5 bh6 and bh9 shown in fig 3 were used to prepare the synthetic halite solution brine samples mineralogical compositions of the core samples are illustrated in fig 4 the highest halite contents were observed in an increasing order in bh6 depth of 73 20 73 40 m bh5 depth of 99 80 100 00 m bh5 depth of 93 00 93 20 m bh5 depth of 87 00 87 20 m and bh9 depth of 110 50 110 70 m in order to obtain the halite solution brine equivalent to the brines of gachsaran member 4 the extracts of these core samples were selected and the hydrochemical compositions are presented in table s2 in sm section 3 1 2 oil field brine whether the oil field brine can really be a source of salinity in this case needs detail investigation there are some evidences in this study area to imply that hydrocarbons seep to the surface mgcec 2015 sapcec 2012 the gachsaran oil field is partly located in the study area around the chamshir dam s reservoir and this region contains many oil production or exploratory wells moreover greasy and oily substances can be observed in outlets of a number of the springs seeps discharging in sz2 the gachsaran evaporative sequence is capable of sealing the asmari reservoir under lithostatic pressure however when the gachsaran formation is outcropped and there is no lithostatic pressure the brines can emerge to the surface with the oil and or gas salati et al 2014 2013 this phenomenon has been reported in many cases in the dezful embayment where the oil reservoirs are shallow rezaei et al 2021 the leaking of hydrocarbon materials emerges at the surficial layers of the gachsaran and mishan formations salisbury et al 1993 furthermore in previous studies regarding sz3 downstream of the chamshir dam the penetration of oil field brines was determined to be the salinity source mgcec 2015 sapcec 2012 evidence of seepage of hydrocarbon substances can be traced in the sediments as these materials can accumulate in the solid phase based on the data presented in table s3 in sm section tph values of the sediments were measured in the range of 150 201 mg kg 1 concentrations of tphs less than 15 mg kg 1 are assumed as background concentrations 15 50 mg kg 1 as light pollution 50 200 mg kg 1 as a moderate pollution and greater than 200 mg kg 1 as high pollution massoud et al 1996 the results show that there is moderate pollution of petroleum hydrocarbons in all sediment samples according to this classification therefore seepage of hydrocarbons compounds and brines from the asmari oil reservoir is likely moreover pah concentrations were measured in the sediment samples the natural origins of pahs include forest fires natural seepage of petroleum and post depositional deformation of biogenic substances whereas the anthropogenic origins include combustion of fossil fuels spillage of petroleum products urban runoff domestic and industrial waste and drainage exhausted fumes from cars and factories acquavita et al 2014 araghi et al 2014 mahdi ahmed et al 2017 these compounds are hydrophobic and scarcely water soluble and as a result they tend to accumulate in fine grained sediments rather than entering the dissolved phase acquavita et al 2014 araghi et al 2014 arienzo et al 2017 mahdi ahmed et al 2017 sixteen toxic pah compounds have been noted by the usepa to have significant adverse effects on species table s3 in sm section these pollutants have a high stability in aqueous phase mahdi ahmed et al 2017 concentrations of less than 100 µg of the pah per kilogram of sediment indicate slight pollution and values greater than 1000 µg kg 1 indicate a highly polluted environment mahdi ahmed et al 2017 total pah concentrations of the sediment samples from inside sz2 are about 11 µg kg 1 and reach values up to 28 µg kg 1 in the sediment samples of sz3 in the downstream of chamshir dam therefore the degree of pollution by pah compounds is negligible in the study area generally three sources of biogenic petrogenic and pyrogenic have been categorized for pahs these compounds usually have petrogenic and or pyrogenic sources in polluted areas pyrogenic pahs have four or more aromatic rings mahdi ahmed et al 2017 when an environment become polluted determining the sources of pollution is challenging however this task is carried out using isomers ratios pahs with 2 3 rings low molecular weight lmw have petrogenic sources and heavy molecular weight hmw pahs are pyrogenic consequently the lmw hmw ratios is commonly used as indexes for distinguishing between these two sources ratios less than one represent the pyrogenic sources and the ratios more than one represent the petrogenic ones acquavita et al 2014 some other isomers ratios are used by researchers as tabulated in table s4 in sm section araghi et al 2014 mahdi ahmed et al 2017 the sources of pahs detected in the sediment samples are illustrated in fig 5 which are chiefly pyrogenic it should be considered that in complex environments where various sources of pollution are affecting the surroundings and low values of concentrations have been measured like this case determination of the pollution sources using isomers ratios can lead to controversial results lubecki and kowalewska 2012 tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 3 2 hydrochemical and isotopic signature of salinity sources to confirm the hypothesis that halite dissolution and oi field brine cause salinization of water resources in the study area the saline water samples i e 12 samples taken from springs seeps and 4 samples from boreholes were evaluated using hydrochemical and isotopic data in order to make deductions three end members were introduced as the representative of plausible sources of salinity comprising 1 fresh surface water including the river samples 2 oil field brine including a gachsaran oil field brine sample sapcec 2012 four marun oil field brine samples mirnejad et al 2011 and three kangan gas field brine samples bagheri et al 2014b 2014a and 3 halite solution brine including five saline extracts collected from the boreholes bh5 bh6 and bh9 fig 4 and table s2 in sm section fig s2 in sm section presents a diagram using major ions to determine the sources of salinity hounslow 1995 the oil field end members are situated in the triangular green area of the diagram representing oil field brine sources most water samples including the springs and river samples are plotted in the central circle representing evaporative mineral dissolution and other water samples are aligned between these two groups suggesting a mixed origin the δ2h versus δ18o data plotted in fig 6 shows that water samples of the study area fall on near the local meteoric water line lmwl which indicates that their origin is meteoric in contrast the oil field samples show a deviating trend from the lmwl indicating the influence of evaporation fig 7a and 7b shows δ18o and δ2h of the water samples versus tds as the salinity index the water samples would be enriched in heavier isotopes and show a rising trend if evaporation was the source of salinity clark and fritz 1997 however the water samples do not show any specific trend and the changes in enrichment of the heavier isotopes versus the increasing salinity is negligible hence evaporation from groundwater cannot be the dominant reason for salinity in the water samples taken from the study area since δ18o is more sensitive to evaporation compared to δ2h it is clear in fig 7a that the oil field samples are enriched in 18o showing the effect of evaporation the concentrations of br and b in oil field brines are relatively higher compared to halite dissolution brines vengosh 2014 so they can be used as a tool to delineate the salinity sources oil field brine samples are distinguished from halite solution brines by the higher ratios of br cl and b cl fig 7c and 7d assuming river samples are composed of meteoric water the springs and borehole samples follow a trend towards the halite dissolution brines the na cl molar ratios of the water samples including the river samples the spring samples and the borehole samples are near the halite dissolution line the line equal to 1 and this ratio deviates from 1 for oil field brines fig 7e the na cl molar ratios less than 1 may indicate mixing with oil field brines rezaei et al 2021 moreover the stable isotope ratio of strontium 87sr 86sr suggests that the mixing with oil field brines was not the dominant process of salinization of spring and borehole samples fig 7f rittenhouse 1967 introduced a diagram using bromide concentration and tds to categorize water samples into five groups plotting the water samples on the rittenhouse diagram fig 8 reveals that the oil field samples fall on group ii and the extracts fall on group iii the river samples lie on group iv and other water samples including the spring and borehole samples are aligned from zone iv to zone iii indicating that halite dissolution has played an important role in the evolution of these waters the saline water samples shifted from the direct trend of the river extract samples towards the right side of the diagram with excess br which may be a sign of mixing with a small proportion of oil field brines plotting molar ratios of cl br versus na br in fig 9 clearly differentiates halite dissolution or residual brines of seawater as the main salinity source the molar ratio of seawater is the partition limit of these two sources in the diagram martini et al 1998 the oil field samples and the extracts representing the halite solution brine are two extreme end members in this plot and all other water samples are plotted in the halite dissolution portion which indicates that halite dissolution plays a major role in the salinity of samples δ37cl values do not show any significant change compared to cl concentration variation as the water flows longer distances and interacts with rocks δ37cl will decrease due to the higher mobility of the lighter isotope i e 35cl li et al 2016 phillips and bentley 1987 it indicates that the difference in cl concentration in water samples is not a result of the difference in residence time in contact with chloride salts evapotranspiration simply increases cl concentration without new sources of cl entering and if the fluid does not reach the point of halite precipitation the chloride isotope ratio will not change therefore the concentration of the cl ion increases in the residual fluid while δ37cl remains unchanged the δ37cl of the water samples in this study is mainly in the range of dissolution of halite by fresh waters 0 1 0 4 with respect to standard mean ocean chloride smoc established by eastoe et al 1999 fig 10 the δ81br values change from 0 29 for the river sample to 0 57 with respect to standard mean ocean bromide smob for the saline spring samples δ81br of the evaporated seawater is in the range of 0 31 to 0 27 smob shouakar stash et al 2007 while the range for the brine resulting from the dissolution of evaporates is 0 12 to 0 88 smob boschetti et al 2011 according to the results obtained in earlier studies it can be concluded that halite dissolution contributes as a principal process in saline water samples of the study area in fig 11 the region representing halite solution brines is red color hatched and all saline water samples including the spring and borehole samples are plotted in this area 3 3 mixing ratio although the hydrochemical and isotopic indicators show that halite dissolution plays a dominant role in salinization of the water samples it seems that various sources of water including the river i e fresh water oil field brine and halite solution brine mix in sz2 using conservative ions like chlorine and bromine help simulate the mixing paths of the end members fig 12 in order to calculate the probable mixing concentrations various mixing ratios and uncertainty in the end member concentrations should be noted carrera et al 2004 in order to calculate the mixing ratio between three end members two conservative ions concentrations e g cl and br must be used the equations presented below can be used to calculate the mixing fractions 1 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 a p 2 f 1 b 1 f 2 b 2 f 3 b 3 b p 3 c f 1 f 2 f 3 1 where f 1 f 2 and f 3 are the mixing ratios of the three end members a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the concentrations of br in the end members and a p in the mixed product while b 1 b 2 and b 3 are the concentrations of cl in the end members and b p in the mixed product the results in table s5 in sm section show that average mixing fractions of the three end members are 0 73 0 02 and 0 25 for river oil field brine and halite solution brine respectively it should be noted that the estimated volumetric ratios are conceptually different from the contribution of each end member in producing total salinity the river constitutes 73 of volume of the average brine which is equal to 43 l s 1 but its contribution in producing salinity is negligible about 0 4 in comparison to the river the halite solution brine has the second greatest volumetric contribution 25 of the average brine equal to 15 l s 1 lastly volumetric contribution of the oil field brine is 2 which is equal to 1 l s 1 the maximum contribution in producing salinity in sz2 belongs to the halite solution brine 94 7 followed by the oil field brine 4 9 in other words the zohreh river passing through sz2 receives 34 g of various salts per cubic meter of the river discharge including 32 g and 2 g originating from the halite solution brine and the oil field brine respectively the hydrochemical behavior of the zohreh river during flood events changes in a manner where tds as an index of salinity decreases while the discharge of the river increases mgcec 2011a 2011b 2011c 2009 the concentration of cl measured at g15 declines versus the rising discharge of the river in flood conditions fig 13 this behavior indicates that no outcropped salt exists in the upstream catchment area at least in large quantities and agrees with the flow model of near constant discharge of deep basin brines previous studies revealed that halite dissolution does not occur at surface and or shallow depths due to this evidence 1 the absence of salt layers near the surface mgcec 2016 sabir company 2020 2 the small percentage of halite detected in xrd analysis of the core samples pertaining to the boreholes of sz2 3 thick layers of salt not detected in depths less than 400 m in the drilling logs of oil production wells in the vicinity of sz2 4 the negative correlation of cl concentration of the river water with discharge during flood conditions therefore halite dissolution most likely occurs at great depths beneath the surface 3 4 mechanism of salinization although the gachsaran formation is widely extended over the study area discharge of the brines is surprisingly focused in a relatively small interval i e sz2 if we believe that the dominant source of salinity is the gachsaran halite dissolution why the salinization phenomenon does not occur along the entire length of the river that flows over the gachsaran in that case we would expect the salinization to occur gradually rather than pointwise in order to answer this question the salinization mechanism at sz2 should be elucidated since the area around sz2 is within the gachsaran formation the hydrogeological characteristics of this formation have a significant impact many marly layers with tectonic disturbance in this formation make it difficult for water to infiltrate into the geological strata however movement of groundwater in insignificant quantities and over limited distances could occur hence there is no widespread aquifer reported in the gachsaran formation due to the impermeable layers of marl it is unlikely that water would flow to depths of over 400 m in this formation to dissolve salt layers according to the lack of salt in surficial layers of the gachsaran formation in sz2 it is therefore expected that the halite solution brine formed at such depths migrates to the surface two hypotheses can be made about the origin and migration mechanism of the halite solution brine the first hypothesis assumes that the meteoric water and or river water percolates to depths of over 400 m then ascends back to the surface after dissolving halite deposits of the gachsaran formation i e member 4 considering the lithology of the gachsaran formation with the thick compacted layers of marl and anhydrite associated with tectonic disturbance the surface water is least likely to freely flow downward and circulate at great depths furthermore extensive hydrostatic head is needed to push water through the impermeable and less permeable layers at such depths therefore the first hypothesis is not supported by reliable geological and hydrogeological evidence the second hypothesis is that the precursor halite brine resided in deep parts of the gachsaran formation i e chiefly members 2 and 4 and somehow ascended to the surface in order to consider the feasibility of this hypothesis firstly the existence of the precursor halite brine in the gachsaran formation should be confirmed and secondly a mechanism should be proposed for the migration of brine to the surface in several studies and reports from the petroleum industry drilling in the gachsaran formation has been recognized as an operation with many difficulties in relation to the layers of salt ashena et al 2020 forutan and hashemi 2011 gholami et al 2018 jinoian 1968 mehrgini et al 2016 these salt layers are defined as high pressure zones which require the density of drilling fluid to be raised to high quantities such quantities are required to overcome the high pore pressure and refrain from wellbore closure which is almost unprecedented in the history of this industry the minerals detected in these layers of salts by naeimavi et al 2018 include halite nacl tachyhydrite cacl2 2mgcl20 12 h2o and anhydrite caso4 where tachyhydrite is more soluble than halite and halite is more soluble than anhydrite the salt layers are generally associated with high pressure saline fluid forutan and hashemi 2011 jinoian 1968 naeimavi et al 2018 the fluid has been sampled during the drilling of oil gas wells by the nioc and its density and tds were reported to be 1 2 g cm 3 and 296 g l 1 respectively tds of the fluid indicates that it is in near saturated conditions in regards to halite in contrast to what is expected the pore pressure of the gachsaran salt layer was detected to be hydrostatic gholami et al 2018 this means the fluid can flow through the thick salt layer the fluid likely originated from the transformation of gypsum to anhydrite ashena et al 2020 as mentioned previously the halite solution of gachsaran formation is high pressured and to overcome the pressure during drilling exercises of oil gas wells the density of drilling fluid normally exceeds 20 ppg forutan and hashemi 2011 the pore pressure of formation fluid of the gachsaran salt layer was measured beyond 1 psi ft 1 ashena et al 2020 therefore if the salt layer resides at a depth of 500 m the pore pressure would be about 1640 psi or 113 bars in the case that there is a failure or a weak surface through the overlaid rock layers such pressure is sufficient for the halite brine to ascend to the surface in a recent study the source of salinity in the coastal sabkha aquifer of abu dhabi uae was concluded to be ascending fluid originating from the gachsaran formation through the use of δ81br δ37cl and 87sr 86sr isotope data saeed et al 2021 another requirement is that a reliable mechanism should be proposed for the migration of halite brine from depth to the surface as mentioned before the impermeable less permeable layers of the gachsaran formation make it difficult for the halite brine to ascend through them hence the only probable mechanism is through structural features like fractures and or faults nonetheless the plastic behavior of gachsaran layers makes it hard to detect such failures according to surficial evidence river sinuosity calculations are an effective method for discovering faults in low relief homogenous areas with low gradient zámolyi et al 2010 the si values of a segment of the zohreh river from the outlet of murd anticline to chamshir dam were measured using the window sizes of 500 1000 1500 2000 3000 4000 and 5000 m and among them the window sizes of 1000 and 1500 m were chosen to analyze the results the si values versus distance from the murd anticline outlet g13 to chamshir dam g15 are plotted in fig 14a the graphical illustration of the results in window size 1500 m is presented in fig 14b in which blue and red colors represent the lowest and the highest values of si respectively two findings can be concluded from these figures firstly the sinuosity pattern of the river changes at a 34 km distance from the outlet of murd anticline before this point the sinuosity level of the river is relatively high and decreases considerably after the point according to theory about river sinuosity this 34 km segment which is geologically located between murd anticline and buried seh qanat anticline fig 14b is elevated compared to the downstream segment likely as a result of the performance of the mff and f7 faults fig 14b secondly sz2 is located between two sinuosity anomalies since increased sinuosity can reliably be connected to faults at local scales zámolyi et al 2010 this can indicate that sz2 is placed between two faults as demonstrated in fig 14b the known faults coincide with the intervals of the river described as high sinuosity nonetheless no surficial evidence for the existence of fault has been detected in order to visualize the tectonic structures and probable faults around sz2 a seismic profile was utilized fig 15 according to this seismic cross section sz2 is placed on the limb of the buried seh qanat anticline the migration of evaporites from the anticlines to the adjacent synclines resulted in the local thickening of evaporative materials in the basal part of the gachsaran formation which was detected in several folds within the dezful embayment as a result of squeezing forces carruba et al 2006 furthermore according to fig 15 sz2 is in the direction of a fault zone between two deep thrusts which intersect the asmari reservoir and the older formations then vanish after entering the gachsaran formation it is likely that the two thrusts have created a crashed zone that helps the saline high pressure fluids from the basal part of the gachsaran formation and the oil field brines of asmari reservoir ascend to the surface through the failures and weak surfaces field evidence also confirms the performance of faults e g nonparallel and disharmonic folds with wavelengths in the range of several hundred meters along the river trench in sz2 as a result of thrust faults these fault related folds are formed on the hanging wall block bernard et al 2007 brandes and tanner 2014 carruba et al 2006 mcclay 2011 4 conclusion the monitoring of ec variations along the zohreh river revealed that salinization occurs mainly in three zones named sz1 sz2 and sz3 in this study we focused on the source and mechanism of salinity in sz2 using various approaches including hydrochemical and isotopic techniques mineralogical and geological investigations mixing ratio calculations and river morphology the hydrochemical and isotopic data of the water samples indicated that the salinization of zohreh river in sz2 is associated with the halite brine and the oil field brine at 95 and 5 respectively halite dissolution in the surficial depth which is prone to shallow water circulating was not supported by geological and hydrogeological evidence such as the absence of a salt layer in the boreholes drilled in sz2 according to the drilling logs of oil wells adjacent to the chamshir reservoir thick layers of salt reside in depths over 400 m the percolation of the meteoric and or surface water to such depths seems unlikely due to the impermeable less impermeable layers of marl and anhydrite in addition in natural field conditions of the study area the hydrostatic head is not sufficient for the penetration and backflow of water on the other hand in many practical experiences in the oil industry the high pressure saline fluids were reported in association with the deep salt layers of the gachsaran formation these fluids can reach the surface if a route was provided under tectonic conditions moreover sinuosity analysis of the zohreh river indicates the performance of several faults in sz2 this theory is strengthened by the results of seismic studies in the study area as well as field evidence such as nonparallel and disharmonic folds of the gachsaran formation strata along the river trench therefore the salinity source of zohreh river in sz2 is primarily the halite brines resided in deep layers of the gachsaran formation i e chiefly members 2 and 4 that ascend to the surface it can be concluded that not only the direct dissolution of halite minerals at surficial depths by circulating waters can cause salinization but also the seepage of halite brines accompanying thick salt layers that are buried at great depths and not exposed to circulating waters need to be considered as they may cause salinization in association with geological structures therefore the possibility of halite brine penetration should be evaluated credit authorship contribution statement ali zaeri conceptualization

7671,study region zohreh river basin southwest iran study focus the salinity of zohreh river sharply increases in three salinity zones szs along the river named sz1 sz2 the focus of this study and sz3 determining the salinity sources and salinization mechanism using an integrated approach including geological hydrochemical isotopic geophysical river sinuosity and hydrocarbon analysis are the main objectives of this study the study focuses on the combination of evidence of regional scale i e river sinuosity and seismic data and small scale i e drilling core analysis new hydrologic insights for the region among several known sources of river salinity it was found that the water quality of the zohreh river is mainly threatened by the salt bearing gachsaran formation and oil field brine it is concluded that halite brine and oil field brine simultaneously cause the salinization in sz2 and their contributions were delineated to be 95 and 5 respectively the lack of reliable geological evidence to support halite dissolution in surficial layers by circulating waters suggests the possibility of a deep source of halite brine in sz2 the results revealed that deep halite brine of the salt layers of gachsaran formation is mainly responsible for the salinization of sz2 the mechanism of deep brine penetration to the river through the hidden fault failures detected by the combination of river sinuosity analysis and geophysical data for the first time graphical abstract ga1 keywords river salinity salinization mechanism isotope halite brine river sinuosity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction worldwide many societies rely on rivers for water supply in addition to the availability of water water quality needs to be considered as well since it can restrict the use of water resources for drinking irrigation and industrial uses in many regions vengosh 2014 understanding the controls on river quality is crucial for preserving vital water resources in the regions facing water scarcity the foremost issue which threatens the chemical quality of natural waters in many arid and semiarid regions is salinity el ashry et al 1985 natural salinity sources e g evaporation and leaching of saline minerals in the soil profile and or anthropogenic sources e g ditch discharge and road salt can give rise to the dissolved constituents like chloride cl and sulphate so4 2 causing salinity kaushal et al 2018 maleki tirabadi et al 2021 naderi et al 2016 determining salinity sources of the river system is an essential step for further investigation like river quality modelling and water resources development planning melesse et al 2020 various hydrochemical and isotopic tracers such as boron b sodium na chloride cl calcium ca2 sulphate so4 2 bromide br and stable isotopes enrichment of hydrogen δ2h oxygen δ18o chlorine δ37cl bromine δ81br and strontium isotope ratio 87sr 86sr have already been introduced in previous studies to investigate the main sources of salinity in natural waters bagheri et al 2014b 2014a boschetti et al 2011 clark and fritz 1997 du et al 2015 eastoe et al 1999 eggenkamp et al 1995 hounslow 1995 li et al 2016 martini et al 1998 mirzavand et al 2020 phillips and bentley 1987 rezaei et al 2021 rittenhouse 1967 shouakar stash et al 2007 vengosh 2014 since a number of processes like water rock interaction membrane filtration and evaporation can alter the original chemical and isotopic composition of the salinity sources discerning the origin of salinity is challenging mirzavand et al 2020 the situation is compounded by the fact that in many cases different sources of salinity simultaneously deteriorate the water quality in combination with other types of pollution including organic and inorganic contaminants detrimental to both humans and the environment eissa 2018 kouchekzadeh and zarei 2017 mohammadi et al 2012 vangosh 2014 vangosh et al 2002 gharaat et al 2022 naturally and or unintentionally occurring organic inputs can leave persistent effects on the river system dos santos rodrigues et al 2018 measurements of total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs and poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs can help assessing the intensity and the origins of oil pollution pahs are a broad range of organic pollutants that have two or more condensed aromatic rings and can be considered to be of natural and or anthropogenic origins acquavita et al 2014 araghi et al 2014 mahdi ahmed et al 2017 massoud et al 1996 the zohreh river located in southwest iran fig 1 is an ideal example of nested basins affected by a combination of pollution and salinity sources including the salt bearing gachsaran formation covering a significant portion of the river basin agricultural lands municipal and industrial waste and effluents aquaculture ponds and oil field reservoirs ahmadee et al 2016 chitsazan et al 2012 khodadadi dehkordi and kashkuli 2015 mohammadi behzad et al 2016 ravanbakhsh et al 2019 valiallahi and khaffaf roudy 2021 the zohreh river is an important source of water in a hot and semiarid region for several purposes including potable water irrigation aquaculture industrial and recreational uses moreover several dams e g sheshpir parsian chamshir shiv kowsar are being constructed or planned along this river therefore monitoring and understanding the controls on water quality of this river is required for public health and sustainability 24 year 1977 2020 monthly water quality data recorded by the fars regional water authority frwa shows that electrical conductivity ec of the zohreh river as an indicator of water salinity increases gradually from the head waters to its mouth average ec values of the zohreh river from the head water to downstream waters during the dry season are plotted along the river course at the stations labeled g1 to g22 in fig 2 three major salinity zones szs here after named sz1 sz2 and sz3 can be highlighted in fig 2 along the zohreh river in which the water salinity increases stepwise a number of studies have been conducted in order to determine causes of local increments in salinity of the river ario behin tarh consulting engineering company abtcec 2017 chitsazan et al 2012 mahab ghods consulting engineering company mgcec 2015 sazand ab pars consulting engineering company sapcec 2012 tehran sahab consulting engineering company tscec and parab fars consulting engineering company pfcec 1997 tehran university 2018 a significant part of sz1 is covered with evaporitic sediments of the early miocene gachsaran formation including halite and gypsum minerals dissolution of such minerals by surface runoff and those infiltrated waters that ends up in the base flow has been introduced as the cause of salinization in sz1 in the report by tscec and pfcec 1997 ec of the river water in sz1 variates between 46 000 and 61 000 µs cm 1 with average discharge of 0 7 m3 s 1 measured at g4 mixing with other fresh tributaries and karstic groundwater discharges alleviates the ec of zohreh river to 960 4320 µs cm 1 at g6 tscec and pfcec 1997 sz3 constitutes of numerous saline brackish sulfurous low discharge springs and seepages emerging along a part of the river course from g16 to g19 the ec of the river water before and after this zone measured by mgcec in 2015 during the base flow about 11 m3 s 1 and it has been reported as 2260 and 5700 µs cm 1 respectively discharge of the brines along the river banks account for the salinization of the zohreh river passing through sz3 although there is a disagreement with regard to the source of these brines different sources have been reported for the saline brines in previous studies including 1 a mixture of deep oil field brines and halite dissolution sapcec 2012 2 halite dissolution at great depths by meteoric water chitsazan et al 2012 and 3 halite dissolution at shallow depth by the river or meteoric water abtcec 2017 compared to the other salinity zones sz2 has received the least attention in previous studies and therefore we focused on sz2 in this study from the confluence of fahaliyan and shiv rivers g11 to the outlet of murd anticline g13 the salinity of zohreh river gradually declines due to mixing with fresh karst water but then rises sharply due to the influence of sz2 when the flow rate of the river drops to less than 10 m3 s 1 during summers ec of the river water increases from the average value of 1095 to 1830 µs cm 1 over a distance of just about 500 m tehran university 2018 at this distance some discharging brines in the form of springs or seeps can be observed and detected near the river on the banksides but the saline springs seeps are not visible except in summers and become concealed below the river flow during wet seasons since sz2 will be submerged by the chamshir reservoir after impoundment it may play a vital role in the water quality of the reservoir and should be taken into consideration the main objectives of this study are to 1 assess the major sources controlling the salinity of zohreh river in particular in sz2 2 determine their contribution in the river salinity and 3 delineate the mechanism of salinization in sz2 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the zohreh river basin is about 15 460 km2 located in the southwest of iran fig 1a the climate in the study area based on the de martonne index varies from cold and humid in the upland montane area to hot and semiarid in the lower downstream lands and the mean annual precipitation over this basin is 835 mm mahab ghods consulting engineering company mgcec 2011a 2011b 2011c the elevation range changes from the maximum value of 3615 m above sea level masl to zero in the coastal areas with an average of 1060 masl mgcec 2011a 2011b 2011c two main tributaries the fahaliyan and the shiv join to form the zohreh river with a length of 478 km fig 1b after crossing several plains and mountainous regions and collecting water from all tributaries it joins the kheir abad river and flows down to its final destination the persian gulf its annual discharge to the persian gulf is over 3 billion cubic meters mgcec 2011a 2011b 2011c in this study we have focused on the part of the river which lies between the head waters and its confluence with the kheir abad river fig 1b g1 to g22 2 2 geological setting the study area is located in the zagros fold belt southwest iran a significant proportion of the zohreh river basin is placed in the structural subdivision of the zagros fold belt called the dezful embayment fig 1a which is well known for its oil fields aghanabati 2004 several hydrocarbon seeps to the surface have been reported in the dezful embayment rezaei et al 2021 salati et al 2014 2013 salisbury et al 1993 tangestani and validabadi 2014 geological formations in the study area chronologically include the asmari oligocene miocene gachsaran early miocene mishan early middle miocene aghajari miocene late pliocene and bakhtiari late pliocene pleistocene and recent sediments labelled abbreviations of as gs mn aj bk and q respectively in fig 3 according to oil drilling data the gachsaran formation with a thickness of 1600 m includes several salt layers from bottom to top this formation is stratigraphically divided into seven members and the thickest salt layers have been reported in members 2 and 4 and to some extent in member 6 aghanabati 2004 motiei 1995 salt stone of this formation is rarely exposed at the surface motiei 1995 based on oil drilling data in the study area no gachsaran salt layers with thickness of up to 4 m belonging to member 6 exist above the depth of 275 m while major salt layers of the gachsaran member 4 with several tens of meters are at the minimum depth of 432 m national iranian oil company south oilfields nisoc 2022 the sequence of geological formations in the study area is presented in fig s1 in the supplementary material sm section based on geological and geophysical data the study area is affected by the basement rooted thrust faults e g mountain frontal flexure mff and dej soleiman thrust causing structural complexity alavi 2007 since detecting faults is challenging in geological formations with plastic behavior e g gachsaran formation sinuosity analysis of the river was used in this research as an approach in order to detect the concealed faults that have no surficial evidence this method is described in the following sections 2 3 water samples and analyses to understand the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the study area i e sz2 sampling of a diverse set of water resources was conducted in two temporal stages in august and october 2020 these water resources include 6 river samples labelled as r in figs 3 7 spring seep samples labelled as s in figs 3 and 4 borehole samples labelled as bh in fig 3 i e bh11 bh12 bh13 and bh14 with final depth of 80 100 61 and 38 m respectively since the springs seeps are only visible during the dry season this is the only period when water sampling is possible and during the rest of the year they are hidden under the raised river level and cannot be sampled the river samples were collected along the zohreh river from upstream of sz2 to downstream at sz3 water samples of the boreholes drilled within sz2 were collected only in the second stage of sampling some seeps were dried out in the second stage of sampling and it was not possible to collect samples all water samples were analyzed for major ions including na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 and a select number of samples were analyzed for minor ions including li b br sr2 i and ba2 and stable isotopes including δ2h δ18o 87sr 86sr δ37cl and δ81br the ec and temperature were measured on site using a portable eutech p450 ec meter all water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm filters except the samples used for measuring major ions and the samples were stored in a cooler until delivered to the laboratory the samples specified for measuring minor ions were collected in dark polyethylene bottles for cation analyses the samples were acidified to a ph less than 2 using concentrated nitric acid 65 hno3 in order to prevent complexation and precipitation of dissolved constituents non acidified samples were allocated to anion and stable isotope analyses the concentrations of major and minor ions were analyzed using ion chromatography at shiraz university central laboratory iran and hydroisotop gmbh germany respectively except for bicarbonate analyzed by titration to evaluate the accuracy of the measurements the ionic balance error ibe was calculated to be less than 5 the water samples for measuring δ18o and δ2h were sealed after filtration in order to avoid any exchange with the atmosphere δ2h δ18o δ37cl and δ81br were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms and 87sr 86sr using mass spectrometry tims at hydroisotop gmbh germany 2 4 solid samples and analyses 2 4 1 sediment samples since the gachsaran oil field is partly located in the study area it is likely to be a potential source of pollution evidence of seepage of hydrocarbon substances can be traced in the sediments as these materials can accumulate in the solid phase hence four sediment samples were collected from the outlets of springs seeps in the second stage of sampling in order to analyze hydrocarbon contents labelled as sed in fig 3 for measuring total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs and poly aromatic hydrocarbons pahs sediment samples were placed in pre cleaned bottles wrapped with aluminum foil stored in cool box in temperature less than 4 c and kept frozen 20 c until analysis tphs and pahs were analyzed as previously described by araghi et al 2014 2 4 2 core samples although the gachsaran formation is widely extended over the study area no salt layer is exposed in the region in order to examine the existence of any salt layer at shallow depths beneath the surface seven boreholes i e bh11 to bh17 were drilled to the maximum depth of 120 m in and around sz2 bh11 and bh 12 were drilled in sz2 adjacent to the saline seeps while bh13 and bh 14 were drilled in upstream of sz2 to provide data for comparison with sz2 bh15 to bh17 had been drilled in an earlier study by sabir company 2020 and only their data was used in this study the locations of these boreholes are presented in fig 3 in order to determine the mineralogical composition of the rock layers a number of core samples from the boreholes were collected the core samples from depths likely to contain salt were separated for xrd analysis in addition to compare the mineralogical compositions of rock layers between sz2 and sz3 the core samples of boreholes drilled in sz3 in which salt stone had been detected were also analyzed the core samples were pulverized using a puck mill and then analyzed by bruker axs d8advance for xrd analysis at azarin zaminazma surena lab iran to address the dynamics of the water rock interaction 50 g of pulverized core samples were mixed into 250 ml of distilled water and stirred for 2 h ec of the mixtures were measured in 0 5 1 2 24 and 48 h after mixing the ultimate ec values were also predicted using phreeqc a geochemical modeling software developed by united states geological survey parkhurst and appelo 2013 for the thermodynamic equilibrium status after 48 h the obtained extracts were separated from undissolved remains by paper filters and analyzed for hydrochemical composition the hydrochemical compositions of the extracts from the core samples with a high percentage of halite were used as the halite solution end member s composition in determining salinity sources 2 5 sinuosity analysis in order to discover the hidden geological structures of the study area that control the groundwater flow and salinization mechanism river sinuosity analysis was conducted rivers have self organizing behavior to maintain their default slope of the riverbed any small change in topographic elevation affects the sinuosity of a low gradient river holbrook and schumm 1999 hence the faults with vertical movements lead to variation of the channel sinuosity value this theory has been tested in past research and led to reliable results petrovszki et al 2012 timár 2003 woolderink et al 2021 zámolyi et al 2010 therefore sinuosity analysis can be an effective method to discover the hidden faults with vertical movements in low relief lands with homogeneous lithology and low gradient classic sinuosity index si represents the river sinuosity which is equal to the ratio of the along channel distance to the straight path length since the river sinuosity is scale dependent si should be calculated and analyzed in various window sizes in this research the si values of the zohreh river were measured using window sizes of 500 1000 1500 2000 3000 4000 and 5000 m as described previously by zámolyi et al 2010 3 results and discussion the results of water sample analyses presented in table s1 in sm section show that all water types in the study area are na cl and in saline water resources which show a higher ec i e saline springs seeps the contribution of these two dominant ions is relatively higher comparing the hydrochemical composition of the water samples in two sampling periods does not show any significant change springs seeps inside sz2 i e s1 s2 and s3 and the water samples taken from boreholes drilled in this zone i e bh11 and bh12 show similar compositions however the boreholes drilled outside of sz2 i e bh13 and bh14 have different hydrochemical compositions even though both groups of boreholes were drilled in the same formation on the riverbank at a distance of approximately 3 km average tds abruptly increased from 1013 mg l 1 in r2 to 1289 mg l 1 in r4 which shows the influence of sz2 in the salinization of the zohreh river other parameters including ec and cl na so4 2 and br concentrations present almost the same increasing trend the total discharge rate of springs seeps in this zone 6 l s 1 with weighted average tds of 144 617 mg l 1 is not sufficient to raise the salinity of the river with a measured discharge of 7 9 and 8 5 m3 s 1 at the first and second time of sampling respectively it seems that a significant volume of the brine is discharged through the riverbed in form of seepage which is not visible the mass balance equation based on the changes in tds cl na so4 2 and br concentrations before and after sz2 suggests that an unknown brine with an average discharge rate of 59 l s 1 and average tds of 110 g l 1 is responsible for the rise of salinity along sz2 possible salinity sources are assessed in the following section 3 1 potential salinity sources the salinity sources of groundwater in general include evaporation oil field brines seawater intrusion deep basin brines and geothermal waters halite dissolution and road salt zarei et al 2013 due to the natural dominant conditions in the study area some of these sources could be ignored the plausible salinity sources in the study area include halite dissolution oil field brines and evaporation the evaporative minerals included in the gachsaran formation like halite can be a potential source of salinity the gachsaran oil field is partly extended beneath the study area which confirms the possibility of oil field brines presence in depth although the climate of the study area is hot and semi arid and the average potential evaporation was measured as 2042 mm mgcec 2011a 2011b 2011c evaporation is not likely as a potential salinity source due to 1 the lack of reservoir or surface water body and 2 the lack of permanent aquifer and groundwater level near the ground surface 3 1 1 gachsaran salt the drilling data were investigated to find out whether the gachsaran formation contains halite that could cause salinization in the study area the outcome of drillings in the gachsaran formation inside sz2 i e bh11 and bh12 with final depth of 80 and 100 m respectively and outside sz2 i e bh13 and bh14 with final depth of 61 and 38 m respectively revealed that limestone gypsum and marl deposits are the main components of rock layers in these locations and as opposed to what was expected no salt layer was detected inside sz2 during excavations based on drilling logs the lithology of the boreholes inside sz2 compared to the ones outside sz2 is relatively similar however the hydrochemical characteristics of the water samples taken from these boreholes are different the measured ec values of water samples taken from bh11 and bh12 are 165 200 and 144 600 µs cm 1 and their cl concentrations are 152 079 and 141 554 ppm respectively the ec values for bh13 and bh14 are 11 170 and 23 800 µs cm 1 and their cl concentrations are 3878 and 10 479 ppm respectively xrd analyses showed that constituent minerals of the core samples include chlorite illite quartz halite gypsum anhydrite calcite dolomite and aragonite the mineralogical compositions of the core samples are presented in fig 4 despite the high ec values of the water samples taken from the boreholes inside sz2 i e bh11 and bh12 the salt content of the core samples pertaining to these boreholes is not significant up to 3 the measured and modeled ec values of the extracts of the core samples are presented in table s2 in sm section and fig 4 which show that the ec of the extracts pertaining to the saline boreholes i e bh11 and bh12 even after reaching the thermodynamic equilibrium condition cannot record values greater than 14 451 µs cm 1 furthermore the ec values of the core samples taken from bh13 and bh14 are approximately similar to those of the saline boreholes therefore the surficial lithology of gachsaran formation cannot be responsible for the salinization in sz2 it seems that the saline brine migrated to this zone from elsewhere according to the oil well drilling logs reported by the national iranian oil company nioc member 4 of the gachsaran formation includes a significant thickness of salt which is important as a potential source of salinity given that salt samples of gachsaran member 4 or the halite brine resulting from this member were not available the core samples comprised of salt in the boreholes of sz3 i e bh5 bh6 and bh9 shown in fig 3 were used to prepare the synthetic halite solution brine samples mineralogical compositions of the core samples are illustrated in fig 4 the highest halite contents were observed in an increasing order in bh6 depth of 73 20 73 40 m bh5 depth of 99 80 100 00 m bh5 depth of 93 00 93 20 m bh5 depth of 87 00 87 20 m and bh9 depth of 110 50 110 70 m in order to obtain the halite solution brine equivalent to the brines of gachsaran member 4 the extracts of these core samples were selected and the hydrochemical compositions are presented in table s2 in sm section 3 1 2 oil field brine whether the oil field brine can really be a source of salinity in this case needs detail investigation there are some evidences in this study area to imply that hydrocarbons seep to the surface mgcec 2015 sapcec 2012 the gachsaran oil field is partly located in the study area around the chamshir dam s reservoir and this region contains many oil production or exploratory wells moreover greasy and oily substances can be observed in outlets of a number of the springs seeps discharging in sz2 the gachsaran evaporative sequence is capable of sealing the asmari reservoir under lithostatic pressure however when the gachsaran formation is outcropped and there is no lithostatic pressure the brines can emerge to the surface with the oil and or gas salati et al 2014 2013 this phenomenon has been reported in many cases in the dezful embayment where the oil reservoirs are shallow rezaei et al 2021 the leaking of hydrocarbon materials emerges at the surficial layers of the gachsaran and mishan formations salisbury et al 1993 furthermore in previous studies regarding sz3 downstream of the chamshir dam the penetration of oil field brines was determined to be the salinity source mgcec 2015 sapcec 2012 evidence of seepage of hydrocarbon substances can be traced in the sediments as these materials can accumulate in the solid phase based on the data presented in table s3 in sm section tph values of the sediments were measured in the range of 150 201 mg kg 1 concentrations of tphs less than 15 mg kg 1 are assumed as background concentrations 15 50 mg kg 1 as light pollution 50 200 mg kg 1 as a moderate pollution and greater than 200 mg kg 1 as high pollution massoud et al 1996 the results show that there is moderate pollution of petroleum hydrocarbons in all sediment samples according to this classification therefore seepage of hydrocarbons compounds and brines from the asmari oil reservoir is likely moreover pah concentrations were measured in the sediment samples the natural origins of pahs include forest fires natural seepage of petroleum and post depositional deformation of biogenic substances whereas the anthropogenic origins include combustion of fossil fuels spillage of petroleum products urban runoff domestic and industrial waste and drainage exhausted fumes from cars and factories acquavita et al 2014 araghi et al 2014 mahdi ahmed et al 2017 these compounds are hydrophobic and scarcely water soluble and as a result they tend to accumulate in fine grained sediments rather than entering the dissolved phase acquavita et al 2014 araghi et al 2014 arienzo et al 2017 mahdi ahmed et al 2017 sixteen toxic pah compounds have been noted by the usepa to have significant adverse effects on species table s3 in sm section these pollutants have a high stability in aqueous phase mahdi ahmed et al 2017 concentrations of less than 100 µg of the pah per kilogram of sediment indicate slight pollution and values greater than 1000 µg kg 1 indicate a highly polluted environment mahdi ahmed et al 2017 total pah concentrations of the sediment samples from inside sz2 are about 11 µg kg 1 and reach values up to 28 µg kg 1 in the sediment samples of sz3 in the downstream of chamshir dam therefore the degree of pollution by pah compounds is negligible in the study area generally three sources of biogenic petrogenic and pyrogenic have been categorized for pahs these compounds usually have petrogenic and or pyrogenic sources in polluted areas pyrogenic pahs have four or more aromatic rings mahdi ahmed et al 2017 when an environment become polluted determining the sources of pollution is challenging however this task is carried out using isomers ratios pahs with 2 3 rings low molecular weight lmw have petrogenic sources and heavy molecular weight hmw pahs are pyrogenic consequently the lmw hmw ratios is commonly used as indexes for distinguishing between these two sources ratios less than one represent the pyrogenic sources and the ratios more than one represent the petrogenic ones acquavita et al 2014 some other isomers ratios are used by researchers as tabulated in table s4 in sm section araghi et al 2014 mahdi ahmed et al 2017 the sources of pahs detected in the sediment samples are illustrated in fig 5 which are chiefly pyrogenic it should be considered that in complex environments where various sources of pollution are affecting the surroundings and low values of concentrations have been measured like this case determination of the pollution sources using isomers ratios can lead to controversial results lubecki and kowalewska 2012 tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 3 2 hydrochemical and isotopic signature of salinity sources to confirm the hypothesis that halite dissolution and oi field brine cause salinization of water resources in the study area the saline water samples i e 12 samples taken from springs seeps and 4 samples from boreholes were evaluated using hydrochemical and isotopic data in order to make deductions three end members were introduced as the representative of plausible sources of salinity comprising 1 fresh surface water including the river samples 2 oil field brine including a gachsaran oil field brine sample sapcec 2012 four marun oil field brine samples mirnejad et al 2011 and three kangan gas field brine samples bagheri et al 2014b 2014a and 3 halite solution brine including five saline extracts collected from the boreholes bh5 bh6 and bh9 fig 4 and table s2 in sm section fig s2 in sm section presents a diagram using major ions to determine the sources of salinity hounslow 1995 the oil field end members are situated in the triangular green area of the diagram representing oil field brine sources most water samples including the springs and river samples are plotted in the central circle representing evaporative mineral dissolution and other water samples are aligned between these two groups suggesting a mixed origin the δ2h versus δ18o data plotted in fig 6 shows that water samples of the study area fall on near the local meteoric water line lmwl which indicates that their origin is meteoric in contrast the oil field samples show a deviating trend from the lmwl indicating the influence of evaporation fig 7a and 7b shows δ18o and δ2h of the water samples versus tds as the salinity index the water samples would be enriched in heavier isotopes and show a rising trend if evaporation was the source of salinity clark and fritz 1997 however the water samples do not show any specific trend and the changes in enrichment of the heavier isotopes versus the increasing salinity is negligible hence evaporation from groundwater cannot be the dominant reason for salinity in the water samples taken from the study area since δ18o is more sensitive to evaporation compared to δ2h it is clear in fig 7a that the oil field samples are enriched in 18o showing the effect of evaporation the concentrations of br and b in oil field brines are relatively higher compared to halite dissolution brines vengosh 2014 so they can be used as a tool to delineate the salinity sources oil field brine samples are distinguished from halite solution brines by the higher ratios of br cl and b cl fig 7c and 7d assuming river samples are composed of meteoric water the springs and borehole samples follow a trend towards the halite dissolution brines the na cl molar ratios of the water samples including the river samples the spring samples and the borehole samples are near the halite dissolution line the line equal to 1 and this ratio deviates from 1 for oil field brines fig 7e the na cl molar ratios less than 1 may indicate mixing with oil field brines rezaei et al 2021 moreover the stable isotope ratio of strontium 87sr 86sr suggests that the mixing with oil field brines was not the dominant process of salinization of spring and borehole samples fig 7f rittenhouse 1967 introduced a diagram using bromide concentration and tds to categorize water samples into five groups plotting the water samples on the rittenhouse diagram fig 8 reveals that the oil field samples fall on group ii and the extracts fall on group iii the river samples lie on group iv and other water samples including the spring and borehole samples are aligned from zone iv to zone iii indicating that halite dissolution has played an important role in the evolution of these waters the saline water samples shifted from the direct trend of the river extract samples towards the right side of the diagram with excess br which may be a sign of mixing with a small proportion of oil field brines plotting molar ratios of cl br versus na br in fig 9 clearly differentiates halite dissolution or residual brines of seawater as the main salinity source the molar ratio of seawater is the partition limit of these two sources in the diagram martini et al 1998 the oil field samples and the extracts representing the halite solution brine are two extreme end members in this plot and all other water samples are plotted in the halite dissolution portion which indicates that halite dissolution plays a major role in the salinity of samples δ37cl values do not show any significant change compared to cl concentration variation as the water flows longer distances and interacts with rocks δ37cl will decrease due to the higher mobility of the lighter isotope i e 35cl li et al 2016 phillips and bentley 1987 it indicates that the difference in cl concentration in water samples is not a result of the difference in residence time in contact with chloride salts evapotranspiration simply increases cl concentration without new sources of cl entering and if the fluid does not reach the point of halite precipitation the chloride isotope ratio will not change therefore the concentration of the cl ion increases in the residual fluid while δ37cl remains unchanged the δ37cl of the water samples in this study is mainly in the range of dissolution of halite by fresh waters 0 1 0 4 with respect to standard mean ocean chloride smoc established by eastoe et al 1999 fig 10 the δ81br values change from 0 29 for the river sample to 0 57 with respect to standard mean ocean bromide smob for the saline spring samples δ81br of the evaporated seawater is in the range of 0 31 to 0 27 smob shouakar stash et al 2007 while the range for the brine resulting from the dissolution of evaporates is 0 12 to 0 88 smob boschetti et al 2011 according to the results obtained in earlier studies it can be concluded that halite dissolution contributes as a principal process in saline water samples of the study area in fig 11 the region representing halite solution brines is red color hatched and all saline water samples including the spring and borehole samples are plotted in this area 3 3 mixing ratio although the hydrochemical and isotopic indicators show that halite dissolution plays a dominant role in salinization of the water samples it seems that various sources of water including the river i e fresh water oil field brine and halite solution brine mix in sz2 using conservative ions like chlorine and bromine help simulate the mixing paths of the end members fig 12 in order to calculate the probable mixing concentrations various mixing ratios and uncertainty in the end member concentrations should be noted carrera et al 2004 in order to calculate the mixing ratio between three end members two conservative ions concentrations e g cl and br must be used the equations presented below can be used to calculate the mixing fractions 1 f 1 a 1 f 2 a 2 f 3 a 3 a p 2 f 1 b 1 f 2 b 2 f 3 b 3 b p 3 c f 1 f 2 f 3 1 where f 1 f 2 and f 3 are the mixing ratios of the three end members a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the concentrations of br in the end members and a p in the mixed product while b 1 b 2 and b 3 are the concentrations of cl in the end members and b p in the mixed product the results in table s5 in sm section show that average mixing fractions of the three end members are 0 73 0 02 and 0 25 for river oil field brine and halite solution brine respectively it should be noted that the estimated volumetric ratios are conceptually different from the contribution of each end member in producing total salinity the river constitutes 73 of volume of the average brine which is equal to 43 l s 1 but its contribution in producing salinity is negligible about 0 4 in comparison to the river the halite solution brine has the second greatest volumetric contribution 25 of the average brine equal to 15 l s 1 lastly volumetric contribution of the oil field brine is 2 which is equal to 1 l s 1 the maximum contribution in producing salinity in sz2 belongs to the halite solution brine 94 7 followed by the oil field brine 4 9 in other words the zohreh river passing through sz2 receives 34 g of various salts per cubic meter of the river discharge including 32 g and 2 g originating from the halite solution brine and the oil field brine respectively the hydrochemical behavior of the zohreh river during flood events changes in a manner where tds as an index of salinity decreases while the discharge of the river increases mgcec 2011a 2011b 2011c 2009 the concentration of cl measured at g15 declines versus the rising discharge of the river in flood conditions fig 13 this behavior indicates that no outcropped salt exists in the upstream catchment area at least in large quantities and agrees with the flow model of near constant discharge of deep basin brines previous studies revealed that halite dissolution does not occur at surface and or shallow depths due to this evidence 1 the absence of salt layers near the surface mgcec 2016 sabir company 2020 2 the small percentage of halite detected in xrd analysis of the core samples pertaining to the boreholes of sz2 3 thick layers of salt not detected in depths less than 400 m in the drilling logs of oil production wells in the vicinity of sz2 4 the negative correlation of cl concentration of the river water with discharge during flood conditions therefore halite dissolution most likely occurs at great depths beneath the surface 3 4 mechanism of salinization although the gachsaran formation is widely extended over the study area discharge of the brines is surprisingly focused in a relatively small interval i e sz2 if we believe that the dominant source of salinity is the gachsaran halite dissolution why the salinization phenomenon does not occur along the entire length of the river that flows over the gachsaran in that case we would expect the salinization to occur gradually rather than pointwise in order to answer this question the salinization mechanism at sz2 should be elucidated since the area around sz2 is within the gachsaran formation the hydrogeological characteristics of this formation have a significant impact many marly layers with tectonic disturbance in this formation make it difficult for water to infiltrate into the geological strata however movement of groundwater in insignificant quantities and over limited distances could occur hence there is no widespread aquifer reported in the gachsaran formation due to the impermeable layers of marl it is unlikely that water would flow to depths of over 400 m in this formation to dissolve salt layers according to the lack of salt in surficial layers of the gachsaran formation in sz2 it is therefore expected that the halite solution brine formed at such depths migrates to the surface two hypotheses can be made about the origin and migration mechanism of the halite solution brine the first hypothesis assumes that the meteoric water and or river water percolates to depths of over 400 m then ascends back to the surface after dissolving halite deposits of the gachsaran formation i e member 4 considering the lithology of the gachsaran formation with the thick compacted layers of marl and anhydrite associated with tectonic disturbance the surface water is least likely to freely flow downward and circulate at great depths furthermore extensive hydrostatic head is needed to push water through the impermeable and less permeable layers at such depths therefore the first hypothesis is not supported by reliable geological and hydrogeological evidence the second hypothesis is that the precursor halite brine resided in deep parts of the gachsaran formation i e chiefly members 2 and 4 and somehow ascended to the surface in order to consider the feasibility of this hypothesis firstly the existence of the precursor halite brine in the gachsaran formation should be confirmed and secondly a mechanism should be proposed for the migration of brine to the surface in several studies and reports from the petroleum industry drilling in the gachsaran formation has been recognized as an operation with many difficulties in relation to the layers of salt ashena et al 2020 forutan and hashemi 2011 gholami et al 2018 jinoian 1968 mehrgini et al 2016 these salt layers are defined as high pressure zones which require the density of drilling fluid to be raised to high quantities such quantities are required to overcome the high pore pressure and refrain from wellbore closure which is almost unprecedented in the history of this industry the minerals detected in these layers of salts by naeimavi et al 2018 include halite nacl tachyhydrite cacl2 2mgcl20 12 h2o and anhydrite caso4 where tachyhydrite is more soluble than halite and halite is more soluble than anhydrite the salt layers are generally associated with high pressure saline fluid forutan and hashemi 2011 jinoian 1968 naeimavi et al 2018 the fluid has been sampled during the drilling of oil gas wells by the nioc and its density and tds were reported to be 1 2 g cm 3 and 296 g l 1 respectively tds of the fluid indicates that it is in near saturated conditions in regards to halite in contrast to what is expected the pore pressure of the gachsaran salt layer was detected to be hydrostatic gholami et al 2018 this means the fluid can flow through the thick salt layer the fluid likely originated from the transformation of gypsum to anhydrite ashena et al 2020 as mentioned previously the halite solution of gachsaran formation is high pressured and to overcome the pressure during drilling exercises of oil gas wells the density of drilling fluid normally exceeds 20 ppg forutan and hashemi 2011 the pore pressure of formation fluid of the gachsaran salt layer was measured beyond 1 psi ft 1 ashena et al 2020 therefore if the salt layer resides at a depth of 500 m the pore pressure would be about 1640 psi or 113 bars in the case that there is a failure or a weak surface through the overlaid rock layers such pressure is sufficient for the halite brine to ascend to the surface in a recent study the source of salinity in the coastal sabkha aquifer of abu dhabi uae was concluded to be ascending fluid originating from the gachsaran formation through the use of δ81br δ37cl and 87sr 86sr isotope data saeed et al 2021 another requirement is that a reliable mechanism should be proposed for the migration of halite brine from depth to the surface as mentioned before the impermeable less permeable layers of the gachsaran formation make it difficult for the halite brine to ascend through them hence the only probable mechanism is through structural features like fractures and or faults nonetheless the plastic behavior of gachsaran layers makes it hard to detect such failures according to surficial evidence river sinuosity calculations are an effective method for discovering faults in low relief homogenous areas with low gradient zámolyi et al 2010 the si values of a segment of the zohreh river from the outlet of murd anticline to chamshir dam were measured using the window sizes of 500 1000 1500 2000 3000 4000 and 5000 m and among them the window sizes of 1000 and 1500 m were chosen to analyze the results the si values versus distance from the murd anticline outlet g13 to chamshir dam g15 are plotted in fig 14a the graphical illustration of the results in window size 1500 m is presented in fig 14b in which blue and red colors represent the lowest and the highest values of si respectively two findings can be concluded from these figures firstly the sinuosity pattern of the river changes at a 34 km distance from the outlet of murd anticline before this point the sinuosity level of the river is relatively high and decreases considerably after the point according to theory about river sinuosity this 34 km segment which is geologically located between murd anticline and buried seh qanat anticline fig 14b is elevated compared to the downstream segment likely as a result of the performance of the mff and f7 faults fig 14b secondly sz2 is located between two sinuosity anomalies since increased sinuosity can reliably be connected to faults at local scales zámolyi et al 2010 this can indicate that sz2 is placed between two faults as demonstrated in fig 14b the known faults coincide with the intervals of the river described as high sinuosity nonetheless no surficial evidence for the existence of fault has been detected in order to visualize the tectonic structures and probable faults around sz2 a seismic profile was utilized fig 15 according to this seismic cross section sz2 is placed on the limb of the buried seh qanat anticline the migration of evaporites from the anticlines to the adjacent synclines resulted in the local thickening of evaporative materials in the basal part of the gachsaran formation which was detected in several folds within the dezful embayment as a result of squeezing forces carruba et al 2006 furthermore according to fig 15 sz2 is in the direction of a fault zone between two deep thrusts which intersect the asmari reservoir and the older formations then vanish after entering the gachsaran formation it is likely that the two thrusts have created a crashed zone that helps the saline high pressure fluids from the basal part of the gachsaran formation and the oil field brines of asmari reservoir ascend to the surface through the failures and weak surfaces field evidence also confirms the performance of faults e g nonparallel and disharmonic folds with wavelengths in the range of several hundred meters along the river trench in sz2 as a result of thrust faults these fault related folds are formed on the hanging wall block bernard et al 2007 brandes and tanner 2014 carruba et al 2006 mcclay 2011 4 conclusion the monitoring of ec variations along the zohreh river revealed that salinization occurs mainly in three zones named sz1 sz2 and sz3 in this study we focused on the source and mechanism of salinity in sz2 using various approaches including hydrochemical and isotopic techniques mineralogical and geological investigations mixing ratio calculations and river morphology the hydrochemical and isotopic data of the water samples indicated that the salinization of zohreh river in sz2 is associated with the halite brine and the oil field brine at 95 and 5 respectively halite dissolution in the surficial depth which is prone to shallow water circulating was not supported by geological and hydrogeological evidence such as the absence of a salt layer in the boreholes drilled in sz2 according to the drilling logs of oil wells adjacent to the chamshir reservoir thick layers of salt reside in depths over 400 m the percolation of the meteoric and or surface water to such depths seems unlikely due to the impermeable less impermeable layers of marl and anhydrite in addition in natural field conditions of the study area the hydrostatic head is not sufficient for the penetration and backflow of water on the other hand in many practical experiences in the oil industry the high pressure saline fluids were reported in association with the deep salt layers of the gachsaran formation these fluids can reach the surface if a route was provided under tectonic conditions moreover sinuosity analysis of the zohreh river indicates the performance of several faults in sz2 this theory is strengthened by the results of seismic studies in the study area as well as field evidence such as nonparallel and disharmonic folds of the gachsaran formation strata along the river trench therefore the salinity source of zohreh river in sz2 is primarily the halite brines resided in deep layers of the gachsaran formation i e chiefly members 2 and 4 that ascend to the surface it can be concluded that not only the direct dissolution of halite minerals at surficial depths by circulating waters can cause salinization but also the seepage of halite brines accompanying thick salt layers that are buried at great depths and not exposed to circulating waters need to be considered as they may cause salinization in association with geological structures therefore the possibility of halite brine penetration should be evaluated credit authorship contribution statement ali zaeri conceptualization

7672,study region major urban areas in henan province of central china study focus data fusion technology is also a key and difficult point in the field of flood research remote sensing and text data have different modalities and scales making fusion difficult this study proposed a remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model based on ufcli and we validated the spatiotemporal distribution of floods and the calculation results of disaster losses the results show that through the coupling analysis of remote sensing and text bimodal data rainstorm and flood events can be fully reproduced in space and time the proposed ufcli effectively improves the accuracy of remote sensing single data inversion for urban flood disaster losses the flood loss in henan is 121 98 billion yuan and the accuracy improvement result is r² increased by 0 08 and mape decreased by 0 88 new hydrological insights for the region in the case of sudden urban storm flooding with complex spatial and temporal evolution the traditional hydrological hydraulic model has many pending parameters which makes it difficult to accurately calculate large scale disaster losses by establishing a theoretical model of bimodal data fusion we effectively use the complementary spatiotemporal information using remote sensing and text to solve the differences in spatiotemporal scales existing between remote sensing and text data the timeliness and accuracy of urban flood damage estimation have further improved data availability statement not applicable graphical abstract ga1 keywords remote sensing and text dual mode data fusion urban flooding space time characteristics disaster loss estimation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under the background of global warming the frequency and intensity of extreme rainstorm events in cities have increased significantly resulting in more frequent floods fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 dong et al 2022 in recent years china s rapid urbanization has led to changes in the underlying surface water environment additionally the urban population and wealth have gathered rapidly and the risk of flood disasters has increased sharply gharakhanlou and perez 2023 du et al 2018 amy and david 1997 under the influence of disordered human activities the extreme changes in hydrometeorology are aggravated and the spatial temporal interaction of the water cycle is complex these changes have a significant impact on the intensity and frequency of urban flood disasters and bring new challenges to urban areas flood control and disaster reduction zhang et al 2015 azari and tabesh 2022 for example in 1988 the yangtze river and other basins in china experienced catastrophic floods caused by heavy rains in 2012 beijing was hit by torrential rain and flooding on july 21 in 2021 henan s july 20 rainstorms and floods caused disasters of different degrees in urban areas of the province urban rainstorms and floods have caused serious economic losses and casualties according to official statistics the flood caused direct economic losses of 120 6 billion yuan in henan province and killed 398 people the disaster is greatly affecting the normal operation of the city which has aroused the attention of the government and experts who have actively carried out data collection and research on urban rainstorms and flood disasters through the accurate estimation of urban flood damage the current situation of flood risk can be determined and then effective flood control and disaster reduction strategies can be formulated chang and zhang 2021 urban flood related data are collected through remote sensing satellites surface hydrometeorological stations artificial fixed point monitoring and many other methods due to the differences in the spatial and temporal scales of various types modes of data multimodal data fusion is difficult therefore to clarify the disaster scope and loss degree under the spatiotemporal evolution of urban rainstorms and floods we urgently need to break through the limitation of data types modes integrate the advantages of each mode of data in time and space scales and deeply study the spatiotemporal evolution law of urban rainstorms and flood disasters on this basis innovate and optimize the disaster loss calculation model of multimodal data fusion to achieve accurate calculation of disaster loss which has important theoretical and practical significance for flood risk management and reducing population and economic losses collins et al 2022 currently there are too many parameters that need to be determined for traditional hydrological and hydrodynamic urban flood disaster research methods using hydrological and historical data additionally the data monitoring points are scattered the collection standards are not unified and there are problems such as low precision and small scale henry et al 2018 in recent years many experts have used machine learning and deep learning models for rainfall runoff and flood modeling related models such as lstm alo anfis gbo elm psogwo etc have achieved many results yuan et al 2018 kadkhodazadeh and farzin 2022 adnan et al 2021 gharakhanlou and perez 2023 however at present machine learning and deep learning models require a huge amount of data moreover the cost of computer hardware is also relatively high therefore some experts have proposed analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban rainstorms and flood disasters based on satellite remote sensing data huang and zhang 2021 song et al 2022 and analyzing the impact of flood disasters and loss degrees on the social economy at the provincial administrative region scale huang et al 2012 the combination of remote sensing data and geographic information systems giss can accurately describe the evolution law of urban rainfall and flood disasters deeply discuss the spatial distribution of urban flood disaster risk and quantify the economic loss of flood disasters madzimur 2019 in addition using sar remote sensing combined with a fuzzy logic algorithm we can draw high precision large scale flood mapping of the underlying surface providing data and technical support for urban flood control and drainage grimaldi et al 2020 with the continuous breakthrough of remote sensing technology the application of high resolution digital terrain remote sensing images dems has effectively improved the accuracy of urban flood disaster estimation liu et al 2023 young et al 2020 compared with traditional research methods based on hydrological and historical data satellite remote sensing images also have spatial scale advantages in identifying floodwater bodies for example based on the landsat 8 image multiband water index algorithm the k means clustering method is used to automatically extract a large area of urban surface floods and analyze flood disaster characteristics wang et al 2017 therefore remote sensing satellites have the natural advantages of large scale and high accuracy and have great application potential in the field of urban rainstorm and flood research xing et al 2023 however due to the limitation of the regression cycle there is a time difference between the transit time of satellite remote sensing and the occurrence time of urban rainstorms and floods the space time mismatch of remote sensing data in monitoring urban rainstorms and flood disasters is more prominent li et al 2014 how to effectively solve the time scale contradiction of remote sensing data in urban rainstorm and flood research is a key problem however with the rapid development of computer information science and network technology the number of internet users has increased rapidly the number of internet users in china has reached 1 032 billion and the internet penetration rate has reached 73 0 sheng and li 2018 the huge internet crowd has created a lot of valuable data experts in the industry use natural language processing nlp technology to mine a large amount of key information on urban rainstorms and floods in the form of word embedding including glove word2vec and other models from internet text data build a visual knowledge map of urban rainstorms and flood word vectors and serve for urban rainstorm and flood disaster risk prediction time space characteristics analysis and research calculations of flood loss lu et al 2018 yang et al 2022 in urban rainstorm and flood events unstructured internet data have high timeliness and rich content which is conducive to multilevel social behavior characterization and mining the internal relationship between floods and disaster losses however internet text information is vague in describing the spatial location of urban rainstorms and flood disasters and lacks spatial topological extensibility as a result internet text information is not sufficient to reveal the dynamic evolution mechanism of urban rainstorms and floods and accurately quantify the disaster scope and degree of disaster loss yang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 then the text information on the internet is more scattered and incomplete than the data provided by professional monitoring platforms these problems greatly affect the application of internet text information in urban flood distribution and disaster loss estimation additionally the credibility of internet text information is difficult to quantify and determine which further affects the use and development of internet text information internet text information is harder to effectively apply in the research field of urban flood evolution and disaster loss therefore the traditional monomodal data method cannot break through the technical bottleneck in the current research field of urban rainstorms and flood disasters how to fuse various modal data scientifically and effectively to study urban rainstorms and flood disasters and realize the complementary advantages of data at the space time scale relevant theories and technologies urgently need to be addressed based on this we can use the internet and social media to extract disaster text information and assist satellite remote sensing data for disaster analysis in urban areas of henan yang et al 2022 liu et al 2018 additionally by integrating remote sensing and social media data it can be used to monitor weather driven urban rainstorms floods and other natural disasters in urban areas wang et al 2018 in addition to social media text information we can also explore the spatial and temporal distribution of natural disasters such as floods in henan cities by mining text information such as news and the research results are helpful to reasonably formulate risk prevention plans liu et al 2018 however remote sensing and text data are difficult to fuse due to their different modalities and scales at present there is a lack of models and theories related to urban flood losses calculation that integrate remote sensing and text data moreover the fusion technology and methods for different modal data are also key and difficult points in the field of flood disaster research he et al 2023 therefore this study proposed a disaster loss calculation model of urban flood bimodal data fusion based on space time information complementation of remote sensing and text which was used to analyze and calculate the disaster loss under the spatiotemporal evolution of floods in urban areas of henan first by combining the advantages of remote sensing large spatial scale high pixel accuracy and internet text data high timeliness large amount of social multilevel interactive information at spatial and temporal scales the remote sensing and text bimodal data coupling inversion of rainstorm spatial and temporal distributions is realized then based on the internet text information mined by nlp technology and coupled with the remote sensing spectrum a natural social multiparty subject behavior reiteration map of urban rainstorms and floods on the spatiotemporal scale was constructed to expound the objective law of flood disasters finally the ufcli model of remote sensing and text based bimodal data fusion is established to calculate the loss of rainstorms and flood disasters verify the accuracy of the model and demonstrate the applicability and scientificity of the ufcli model this study can provide theoretical support for accurate flood resilience in urban areas and other efforts and provide new ideas for accurate estimation of flood hazards on a regional scale and it provides a typical reference for other urban area studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area henan province is in the central region of china with east longitudes of 110 21 116 39 e and north latitudes of 31 23 36 22 n as shown in fig 1 henan province is high in the west and low in the east governing zhengzhou luoyang kaifeng and other important cities with a total area of approximately 16 7 km² the province has developed water systems and transportation networks liu et al 2017 shi et al 2022 in recent years the gross domestic product gdp of henan province has ranked among the top five in china with rapid economic development and a gradually increasing urbanization scale henan is an important economic province in china chang et al 2022 the annual rainfall is concentrated between june and september due to the large population in the province the total asset value per unit area and population density of major cities increase year by year and the urban flood disaster risk shows an upward trend liu et al 2017 chang et al 2022 from the perspective of physical geography environment and conditions in henan province it is similar to most cities in china in addition the case of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan used this time is a once in a thousand years rainstorm event and the daily rainfall in zhengzhou city henan province is more than 500 mm the urban flood disaster caused by a rainstorm has a wide range of impacts and huge losses and the flood control and drainage defects in the process of urban construction and development are more obvious based on the data from this rainstorm event the calculated results of the constructed model are easier to verify by calculating and analyzing typical cases we can fully understand the key parameters of urban flood disaster losses and apply the constructed model to other urban areas such as beijing guangzhou etc which is also more accurate and easier zhai and lee 2023 2 2 access to data and materials based on the multimodal fusion model of the multidimensional remote sensing spectrum and internet text data many multimodal data are needed to restore the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan explore the spatial temporal linkage of urban rainstorms and floods and realize efficient and accurate rainstorm and flood disaster loss calculations text data come from internet sources such as weibo baidu and

specific derivation process and parameter meaning which will not be repeated in the text in this study at different stages of the flooding disaster the government the media the public and various social groups through the internet platform publish real time important information such as text descriptions related to the disaster site with personal location information pictures and video displays real time evolutionary data of disasters is shared from different dimensions and text information is forwarded in large volume easily and widely disseminated hence based on electronic text data about the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan on the internet july 19 july 22 baidu weibo government documents etc this study constructed the glove keyword of the july 20 rainstorm event

economic loss was determined according to the comprehensive flood loss index per unit area and the calculation formula is duan et al 2022 13 l dp β rs a 14 a i 1 n f i 15 β rs a 1 α γ β where l dp is the direct economic loss from flooding β rs is the direct loss per unit area which is jointly calculated by light remote sensing and gdp a is the area of flood disaster f i is the i th pixel of the remote sensing spectrum n is the number of pixels and the size of each pixel can be calculated according to the resolution of remote sensing data β is the annual loss per unit area of historical flood

taken as 0 04 and γ times of power duan et al 2022 the multidimensional remote sensing spectrum was introduced into the flood loss calculation model and the pixel was taken as the calculation unit to effectively improve the inundation area a and the direct economic loss per unit area β rs solution accuracy the normalized difference water index ndwi proposed by mcfeeters was used to interpret flood disaster water images in henan province huang and zhang 2021 ashok et al 2021 16 ndwi green nir green nir where green is the green band of remote sensing images and nir is the near infrared of remote sensing images see references huang et al 2021 and ashok et al 2021 for specific parameters 2 3 6 construction of the remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model in the traditional calculation method of flood losses in hydrology and hydrodynamics the calculation scale is small due to the limited data range moreover it overlooks the real time and rich data information provided by the internet s big data on urban floods in various aspects however there were limitations in internet text data such as insufficient spatial information about urban flood disasters and a lack of disaster loss degree data remote sensing data is limited by the regression period and lacks information on the temporal continuity of disaster events in the short term yang et al 2022 therefore the urban flood comprehensive loss index ufcli of remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion is constructed to carry out bimodal data fusion and quantification of urban rainstorm and flood disasters break data barriers and improve the scope timeliness and accuracy of urban flood disaster loss estimation based on the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan internet text mining and remote sensing inversion we obtained the spatial temporal distribution and disaster damage results of urban rainstorms and floods as shown in fig 4 first using internet text data and based on the giove model combined with the krusal jsc and sofm algorithms we conducted information mining on urban flood disasters at high time scales using multi dimensional remote sensing data combined with the ndwi normalized difference water index and a flood damage model calculate the losses of urban flood disasters at a high spatial scale duan et al 2022 then this study selected the respective characteristic indicators of bimodal data text economic status gdp total rainfall p hourly maximum rainfall p h word frequency of city name n and number of victims n remote sensing flood disaster area a terrain elevation difference h remote sensing loss estimation β and the urban flood comprehensive loss index ufcli based on remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion were constructed through the normalization of bimodal data indicators next internet text data are used to mine the high time scale information of urban flood disasters and based on the ufcli evaluation system combined with the spatial scale advantages of multiremote sensing satellite data a multidimensional remote sensing internet text bimodal data fusion model was constructed the spatial temporal linkage of urban rainstorm and floods was explored and efficient and accurate estimations of rainstorms and flood disaster losses were achieved finally the ufcli index and related model are used to quantitatively evaluate and verify the accuracy of the estimation results of urban flood losses the establishment process is as follows 17 y i k x i k max x i k where x i k is the i th index of the kth city max x i k is the maximum value of the i th index of the kth city and y i k is the normalization of the ith index of the kth city y 0 1 let a 1 a 2 a n be different index weights then the multimodal urban flood comprehensive loss degree ufcli is 18 ufcli k 1 m i 1 n a i y i k weight in power a 1 a 2 a n and a 1 a 2 a n 1 then a i 1 n eq 18 can be expressed as 19 ufcli 1 n k 1 m i 1 n x i k max x i k based on the ufcli multi index evaluation system and the above models a remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model was constructed the ufcli index was used to optimize the remote sensing inversion of direct economic losses β rs finally the bimodal data fusion based on ufcli was obtained to estimate the direct economic loss of flood disasters β ufcli the calculation model is as follows 20 β ufcli i 1 n k β rs where k is the proportion coefficient and the official statistical value of direct economic loss that can be mined from text β t is calculated by linear regression with the ufcli index 3 results 3 1 keyword extraction and collinear network establishment the results of glove keyword part of speech categories for the july 20 rainstorm event in zhengzhou henan are shown in fig 5b nouns proper nouns adjectives adverbs verbs and designated words accounted for 49 85 12 49 0 97 2 93 22 and 11 76 respectively according to the data calculated from the proportion of parts of speech nouns verbs and proper nouns play an absolutely dominant role in the acquisition of textual subject information accounting for more than 80 therefore in the process of keyword mining flood text some invalid high frequency words such as of and also or too can be appropriately removed according to the part of speech after optimization the word cloud is drawn as shown in fig 5a in the word cloud picture the contents of july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan are complex among which henan zhengzhou extraordinary storm flood disaster economic loss and casualties are the most frequent in addition time related high frequency words such as on july 20 on july 21 and on july 22 provide important time node information about rainstorm disasters the data based on internet electronic text big data mining show that the torrential rain centered on zhengzhou henan province and the broad masses of the country are highly concerned about the damage and impact of disaster events to further explore the internal relationship between the glove keyword and july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan a collinear network of july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan vocabulary was constructed based on jsc theory and the kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm as shown in fig 5c glove keyword extracts five main subgraphs for information exchange and the set composed of each subgraph expresses the subject of july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan among them the five main subgraphs fig 5c represent the evolution of rainstorm events urban infrastructure government regulation scientific and technological support and flood insurance payout 3 2 spatiotemporal coupling of rainstorms based on remote sensing and text internet text data have the characteristics of real time updates wide sources various information high temporal resolution and low spatial resolution however the initial information in internet text data events is incomplete such as the specific rainfall range and rainfall in various regions and the information cannot be expressed intuitively comparatively speaking the measured data of remote sensing and meteorological stations has good continuity accuracy and spatial scalability but the data acquisition time lags the internet to solve the inherent contradictions of internet text remote sensing and meteorological station measured data the advantages of time scale and spatial scale in different modal data were combined this study was based on the mining and extraction of the text data of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan on the internet and restored the time axis of the flood event according to the high frequency time keywords in fig 5a using the vocabulary collinear network of text mining and five main subgraphs fig 5c combined with dem elevation satellite remote sensing images and henan rainfall data text mining and site download a remote sensing and text coupled spatial temporal distribution topology map of rainstorms was constructed as shown in fig 6 text data provide a detailed accurate and complete time axis of flood events from the time scale remote sensing data provide the large scale distribution and evolution characteristics of rainfall in the province on a spatial scale based on the complementary advantages of time space scales of remote sensing and text data the dynamic evolution process of rainstorm and flood events is reproduced in different time periods by using the word cloud map fig 5a word collinear network grouping the appearance time points of five main subgraphs fig 5c and remote sensing rainfall distribution images of key rainfall durations as shown in fig 6 based on the evolution time axis of rainstorm and flood events combined with the spatial and temporal distribution of different rainfall stages retrieved by remote sensing and the five main subgraphs of the vocabulary collinear network of internet text mining a complete spatiotemporal multisubject interaction process of july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan coupled by remote sensing and text is constructed based on the coupled processing of remote sensing and text bimodal data the topological map fig 6 of the dynamic evolution and spatial and temporal distribution of urban rainstorm and flood events in henan province is explained in detail as follows first in the stage of rainfall some experts use science and technology subgraph scientific and technical support to predict rainstorms local government departments subgraph government guidance make flood control plans according to the evolution of rainstorm events expert technical guidance and real time dynamic situations of rainstorms second in the flood stage caused by rainstorms zhengzhou was high in the southwest and low in the northeast with a large terrain elevation difference the drainage system of the underlying surface does not match the rapid urbanization which accelerated the confluence of rainwater and aquatic products on the ground causing serious floods subgraph urban infrastructure governments at all levels and social organizations conduct comprehensive flood control and disaster relief the news media report real time disaster situations and statistical data providing a data basis for the formulation of the next step of work such as flood fighting and disaster relief then at the end of the rainfall and flooding the economic losses and maximum rainfall values of each city were announced one after another the cbirc china banking and insurance regulatory commission held a press conference subgraph flood insurance payout to report on disaster losses and flood insurance compensation finally at the stage of investigation and summary the july 20 torrential rain disaster investigation report was officially released which summarized the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan in detail in the form of text in summary first we build a coupled spatial temporal distribution of urban rainstorms by complementing the advantages of remote sensing and text data at the spatial temporal scale then combined with the collinear network drawn by the keyword vector of text mining fig 5 a natural social multiagent behavior interaction diagram fig 6 of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan on a spatiotemporal scale was constructed to explain the objective laws of flood disasters finally the lag of remote sensing data and the discontinuity of text data are effectively solved the bimodal coupling of remote sensing and text data is completed and the recurrence of urban rainstorm and flood disaster events and the characterization of spatiotemporal dynamic evolution are realized 3 3 estimation of disaster loss based on the ufcli index the calculation process of rainstorm and flood disaster loss based on the multidimensional remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model is as follows data acquisition data processing data result verification and verification of the calculation accuracy of the ufcli flood disaster loss model of data bimodal fusion 4 steps as shown in fig 7 first multidimensional remote sensing spectral images modis remote sensing dem elevation remote sensing and dmsp night light remote sensing were obtained and the data layer pixels were calibrated based on the photosensitive spectrum image the flood disaster area was interpreted in combination with the ndwi water index and the data preprocessing is complete fig 7a then massive text data of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan were collected through the internet weibo baidu etc and the text data format was standardized for the convenience of subsequent data processing fig 7b next based on remote sensing spectral images henan flood zoning fig 7c and light remote sensing spatial distribution fig 7d were constructed to carry out light remote sensing urban economy flood disaster spatial coupling inversions fig 7c 7d and 7f the standardized text information data are deeply mined by glove keywords and the comprehensive loss degree of flood disasters was calculated according to the urban economic status gdp total rainfall p and flood disaster scope a the sofm self organizing mapping neural network fig 7e was used to construct the comprehensive disaster grade zoning as shown in fig 7g it was divided into grades i v and i represents the most serious grade then remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion fig 7h were used to realize the bimodal fusion and visualization of urban flood disaster data fig 7f and 7g finally based on the multidimensional remote sensing and internet text bimodal fusion data combined with the remote sensing pixel flood loss model the ufcli index system was constructed formula 19 additionally remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion were completed to estimate the disaster loss degree of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan as shown in table 1 the sofm zoning was consistent with the flood area and disaster damage results retrieved by the remote sensing of cities in henan province the flood area of cities in henan province was approximately 5982 8 km² the direct economic loss was 120 06 billion yuan according to the result of text mining and 113 04 billion yuan according to the result of remote sensing calculations and a total of 398 people were killed zhengzhou was the main battlefield for flood fighting and disaster relief and the urban flood area was approximately 829 8 km² the direct economic loss was 40 9 billion yuan according to the result of text mining and 43 18 billion yuan according to the result of remote sensing calculation the economic loss of the zhengzhou flood disaster under text mining accounts for 34 of the province and the remote sensing calculation is 38 a total of 380 people were killed in zhengzhou accounting for 95 5 of the province the remaining cities were ranked by sofm zoning and disaster damage volume and the disaster losses in luoyang nanyang xuchang zhoukou and xinxiang are relatively serious the urbanization economy gdp is large area a and the direct loss per unit area β is aggravated it is not difficult to see from the results in table 1 that the direct economic losses of flood disasters extracted or retrieved by different modes of text and remote sensing were different the official text data are highly reliable but the direct economic loss of text data mining is relatively serious therefore we calculated the ufcli index according to the text remote sensing bimodal data parameters and combined it with model 19 then using the ufcli index and model 20 the direct economic loss is corrected β ufcli based on the remote sensing inversion results finally based on remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion the lack of text data was filled and the accuracy of the disaster loss results from remote sensing inversion was optimized and calibrated 3 4 accuracy verification of the bimodal data fusion model based on the ufcli index there are structural differences between different modal data sets and direct comparison lacks a scientific basis to verify the effect of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model on improving the accuracy of remote sensing data it is necessary to quantitatively analyze the differences between text and different modal remote sensing data most of the specific statistical data about flood disasters comes from government announcements official media and measured data published by local scientific research and meteorological institutions therefore text mining data are used as the standard to compare the differences between text and remote sensing unimodal data first the data parameters of text mining urban gdp total rainfall hourly maximum rainfall number of deaths frequency of urban occurrence and remote sensing flood disaster area terrain elevation difference remote sensing disaster damage estimation are normalized according to formula 19 then a remote sensing and text regression model was established as shown in fig 8a the overall trend of text and remote sensing data inversion is the same as that of the 7 20 rainstorm and flood disaster in henan r² 0 72 rss 0 19 f 41 35 however from the comparison of data at various points there were obvious differences between text and remote sensing monomodal data and the regression coefficient r² 0 72 0 8 the calculation results showed that although remote sensing data have spatial advantages the accuracy of remote sensing monomodal data was low therefore it was necessary to fuse text data to improve accuracy the ufcli bimodal data fusion model breaks the barriers of different modal data and the integrated evaluation system was more objective and comprehensive in the evolution of the spatiotemporal scale of flood disasters therefore based on the ufcli bimodal data fusion model this study completed the fusion of high precision text mining indicators and remote sensing inversion indicators then the spatial and temporal characteristics and disaster losses of flood disasters in different cities were studied through the ufcli index finally the severity of urban flood disasters was described and the accuracy of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model was verified the accuracy evaluation indicators are shown in table 2 1 the ufcli text regression model was established through the calculated value of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model and the normalized text mining data parameters as shown in fig 8b and table 2 r² 0 96 rss 0 03 f 396 59 and mape 0 53 this shows that the deviation between the calculated value of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model and the data value of text mining is low and the calculation effect of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model was good 2 the calculated value of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model and the normalized remote sensing inversion data parameters are used to establish a regression model and verify that r² 0 88 rss 0 08 f 114 12 and mape 1 41 according to the calculation and analysis r² increased by 0 08 rss decreased by 0 05 f increased by 282 47 and mape decreased by 0 88 the results showed that the ufcli bimodal data fusion model can effectively improve the accuracy of remote sensing inversion 4 discussions different modal information data have unique advantages and disadvantages internet text time scale and remote sensing data spatial scale show the spatial temporal characteristics of urban flood disasters from different perspectives bimodal data information complements and verifies each other enriching the expression of disaster related information yang et al 2022 liu et al 2018 4 1 the role of text mining in urban flooding internet text information can quickly obtain the basic data of the initial stage of urban flood events with the development of urban flooding text information has a strong ductility of time which provides important data support for urban flood control and disaster reduction work and personnel and material scheduling yang et al 2019 the network text contains rich disaster information which has the advantages of high timeliness and rich disaster information compared with remote sensing data yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 li et al 2021 through internet text data mining the main subgraphs and the glove keywords contained in each subgraph as shown in fig 5 can be reproduced interactively for the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan according to fig 6 first according to meteorological monitoring henan will have large scale high intensity rainfall and individuals and relevant government departments will prepare for flood fighting and disaster reduction second there are differences in the geographical and historical conditions urbanization and economic development level of the underlying surface in henan counties cities districts under the condition of heavy rainfall the rainfall at multiple stations in henan province broke through the historical extreme value causing floods of varying degrees in various regions as rainstorms continue flood disasters have brought about serious property losses and casualties governments at all levels from the central to local levels went deep into the disaster areas for the first time cooperated with existing scientific and technological means to carry out investigation and guidance and carried out flood relief cheng et al 2019 finally according to the scale of the disaster and the degree of damage government departments helped henan cities with post disaster reconstruction in addition with the participation of the china banking and insurance regulatory commission the insurance company s flood insurance compensation process should be supervised the above analysis shows that the july 20 henan rainstorm and flood event flood relief is the result of the joint efforts of many parties the internet and mass media information data have high practical value in the field of flood disaster research wu et al 2019 therefore big data mining based on internet electronic text will quickly and accurately obtain flood disaster event information on a large scale and provide data support for government rescue scheduling accurate flood fighting and other work rosser et al 2017 4 2 the role of remote sensing inversion in urban flooding remote sensing data has strong spatial scale information which intuitively records static plane images of urban areas before and after flood disasters occur provide data basis for urban flood control construction planning regional disaster reduction and safety layout etc moreover remote sensing inversion of disaster losses has fewer parameters than traditional calculation methods makes data easy to obtain covers a wide range of data and saves a lot of human resources in data collection through multidimensional remote sensing multiple categories of two dimensional data images can be obtained such as terrain and geomorphology administrative boundaries lighting and economic distribution urban community scope etc liu et al 2023 however the data range obtained by traditional manual and instrument measurements is too small to support the study of flood damage at the urban scale henry et al 2018 duan et al 2022 therefore by using remote sensing data to invert the impact range of urban flood disasters combined with remote sensing inversion models the disaster losses of each remote sensing pixel can be calculated and the disaster damage information of specific locations can be preliminarily estimated as shown in fig 7a the two dimensional distribution map of flood disaster losses retrieved from remote sensing data is shown however remote sensing data has a time interval and in order to more accurately and timely invert the results of urban flood damage it is necessary to combine internet text data with time scale advantages and easy access building a flood disaster loss calculation model through data fusion will help improve the accuracy of urban flood disaster inversion in terms of time and space further improve computational efficiency xing et al 2023 4 3 discussion on the regularity of urban flooding with bimodal data there were limitations in the text data on the internet such as insufficient spatial information about urban flood disasters and a lack of disaster loss degree data yang et al 2022 therefore in this study we propose the ufcli index and build a remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model fig 7 then by effectively using and combining the advantages of the time scale of the text and the spatial scale of remote sensing data the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan are mutually verified and complementary and the spatiotemporal linkage of urban floods is discussed in depth fig 6 and fig 7 yang et al 2022 rosser et al 2017 4 3 1 disaster characterization of urban rainstorms and floods with different modal data typical text mining data total rainfall p hourly maximum rainfall p h and typical remote sensing inversion data dem poster height h flood disaster area a was selected for discussion rainfall p shown in fig 9a is a necessary and insufficient condition for rainstorms to cause flood disasters according to the calculation data in table 1 there is a positive correlation between rainfall p and flood disaster area next through remote sensing dem images the terrain elevation difference of urban areas in henan province is calculated then we established a regression model between poster height h and flood disaster area a as shown in fig 9b the regression progress verification results are r² 0 74 mae 24 22 rmse 22 22 f 45 87 and p 0 05 the calculation results show that the greater the terrain elevation difference of the city is the greater the formation of rainstorms and flood disasters the greater the difference in urban altitude is the higher the risk of floods caused by rainstorms the wider the scope of disasters and the more serious property losses li et al 2012 4 3 2 spatial and temporal characterization of urban flooding by sofm and ufcli important parameters in ufcli such as urban development scale total gdp flood affected area a and the number of victims n are closely related to sofm flood zoning showing a positive correlation as shown in fig 10a taking zhengzhou as an example the urban development scale is the largest the total gdp is the highest the terrain elevation difference h is large the flood affected area a is the highest the death toll is the highest 380 people and the sofm flood zoning level is the highest therefore the sofm and ufcli characterize the temporal and spatial correlation of parameters between urban rainstorms and flood disasters although p and p h surpass the historical extreme value the once in a thousand years heavy rain is an important cause of flood disasters however other disaster causes such as urbanization topographic factors imperfect structural measures and nonstructural measures cannot be ignored therefore in urban rainstorm and flood disaster events the different parameters of each modal data are correlated in the spatiotemporal evolution of urban flood disasters by constructing the flood disaster comprehensive loss index ufcli evaluation system we explore the spatial temporal linkage of urban rainstorms and floods and the objective factors that cause flood disasters combining the space time scale advantages of remote sensing and text bimodal data a ufcli flood damage regression model fig 8 and fig 9b was established to carry out efficient and accurate quantitative analysis and evaluation of the space time evolution of rainstorms and floods and disaster damage calculations it provided theoretical and technical support for exploring the occurrence and development temporal and spatial distribution and loss estimation of urban flood disasters in conclusion according to the analysis of dual mode time space characteristic parameters of remote sensing and text rainfall is an insufficient and necessary condition for urban rainstorms to cause flood disasters in addition to rainfall p economic scale gdp and altitude difference h are key parameters of urban flood disasters when rainfall exceeds the water storage and drainage capacity of the urban underlying surface the excessive water volume cannot be properly controlled threatening the normal operation of the city and the safety of people and property and flooding will occur in the short term it is difficult to significantly improve the flood standard of engineering measures so nonengineering measures can be reasonably used for urban flood prevention and mitigation this study attempted to combine multidimensional remote sensing to obtain a high spatial resolution vector data network and propose the flood disaster comprehensive loss index ufcli then a remote sensing and text bimodal fusion model was constructed to solve the problem of missing text monomodal data and spatial scale ambiguity as shown in table 1 statistical data of direct economic losses of the internet finally the inversion accuracy of the calibrated remote sensing monomodal data table 2 was improved to realize the complementary advantages of the spatial temporal scale of the dataset this study provides a new idea for the accurate and efficient estimation of large scale flood damage 5 conclusions to realize the information complementation of remote sensing and text on the space time scale under the complex spatiotemporal evolution of henan urban rainstorms and floods large scale disaster losses can be accurately calculated additionally the shortcomings of traditional urban flood disaster research methods such as low precision and small scale were solved theoretically and technically first based on the research on the topology of the internet text glove network the analysis of the collinear network and combined with remote sensing dem and other data we constructed the spatiotemporal distribution of urban rainstorms with remote sensing and text coupling the spatiotemporal evolution and distribution of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan were successfully excavated and the spatiotemporal scale of the rainstorm event was restored and reconstructed then based on the ufcli index system a bimodal data fusion model of multielement remote sensing and internet text was constructed finally based on the remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model of the ufcli index rainstorm flood damage is calculated and its accuracy is verified the main conclusions were as follows 1 using remote sensing data coupled with common line network text information combined with inversion of the spatiotemporal distribution of heavy rainfall a spatiotemporal evolution map of heavy rainfall and flooding events can be effectively established the spatiotemporal evolution and distribution analysis of urban flooding shows that there are obvious natural social multi factor interactions in the spatiotemporal scale of storm flooding events the coupled analysis of remote sensing and text bimodal data further realizes a comprehensive replication of the storm flooding events at the spatial and temporal scales 2 based on the ufcli index system a bimodal data fusion model was constructed to realize the complementation of text remote sensing spatiotemporal information the accuracy verification effect of through analysis and calculation shows that the ufcli text regression model was good r² 0 96 rss 0 03 f 396 59 mape 0 53 the ufcli fusion model effectively improves the accuracy of flood disaster loss inversion from remote sensing single mode data r² increased by 0 08 rss decreased by 0 05 f increased by 282 47 and mape decreased by 0 88 3 the main problem faced in this study is that it does not combine multiple types of remote sensing such as spectral and radar data fusion and other data sets to avoid cloud occlusion from affecting the inversion results and we did not conduct credibility related evaluations of internet text data nor did we integrate more valuable data such as images and videos in the future based on the method of this study the integration of radar remote sensing as well as video and image information is considered to improve the data accuracy and compare with other fusion methods to further optimize the structure of ufcli model and the rationality of parameters and build a multimodal data fusion model of text remote sensing images video 4 the results of this study achieve efficient and accurate urban storm flood damage estimation in urban areas of henan this for provides guidance for accurate flood fighting and rescue in urban areas of henan and can provide typical reference for accurate flood damage estimation in other urban

7672,study region major urban areas in henan province of central china study focus data fusion technology is also a key and difficult point in the field of flood research remote sensing and text data have different modalities and scales making fusion difficult this study proposed a remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model based on ufcli and we validated the spatiotemporal distribution of

sharply gharakhanlou and perez 2023 du et al 2018 amy and david 1997 under the influence of disordered human activities the extreme changes in hydrometeorology are aggravated and the spatial temporal interaction of the water cycle is complex these changes have a significant impact on the intensity and frequency of urban flood disasters and bring new challenges to urban areas flood control and disaster reduction zhang et al 2015 azari and tabesh 2022 for example in 1988 the yangtze river and other basins in china experienced catastrophic floods caused by heavy rains in 2012 beijing was hit by torrential rain and flooding on july 21 in 2021 henan s july 20 rainstorms and floods caused disasters of different degrees in urban areas of the province urban rainstorms and floods have caused serious economic losses and casualties according to official statistics the flood caused direct economic losses of 120 6 billion yuan in henan province and killed 398 people the disaster is greatly affecting the normal operation of the city which has aroused the attention of the government and experts who have actively carried out data collection and research on urban rainstorms and flood disasters through the accurate estimation of urban flood damage the current situation of flood risk can be determined and then effective flood control and disaster reduction strategies can be formulated chang and zhang 2021 urban flood related data are collected through remote sensing satellites surface hydrometeorological stations artificial fixed point monitoring and many other methods due to the differences in the spatial and temporal scales of various types modes of data multimodal data fusion is difficult therefore to clarify the disaster scope and loss degree under the spatiotemporal evolution of urban rainstorms and floods we urgently need to break through the limitation of data types modes integrate the advantages of each mode of data in time and space scales and deeply study the spatiotemporal evolution law of urban rainstorms and flood disasters on this basis innovate and optimize the disaster loss calculation model of multimodal data fusion to achieve accurate calculation of disaster loss which has important theoretical and practical significance for flood risk management and reducing population and economic losses collins et al 2022 currently there are too many parameters that need to be determined for traditional hydrological and hydrodynamic urban flood disaster research methods using hydrological and historical data additionally the data monitoring points are scattered the collection standards are not unified and there are problems such as low precision and small scale henry et al 2018 in recent years many experts have used machine learning and deep learning models for rainfall runoff and flood modeling related models such as lstm alo anfis gbo elm psogwo etc have achieved many results yuan et al 2018 kadkhodazadeh and farzin 2022 adnan et al 2021 gharakhanlou and perez 2023 however at present machine learning and deep learning models require a huge amount of data moreover the cost of computer hardware is also relatively high therefore some experts have proposed analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban rainstorms and flood disasters based on satellite remote sensing data huang and zhang 2021 song et al 2022 and analyzing the impact of flood disasters and loss degrees on the social economy at the provincial administrative region scale huang et al 2012 the combination of remote sensing data and geographic information systems giss can accurately describe the evolution law of urban rainfall and flood disasters deeply discuss the spatial distribution of urban flood disaster risk and quantify the economic loss of flood disasters madzimur 2019 in addition using sar remote sensing combined with a fuzzy logic algorithm we can draw high precision large scale flood mapping of the underlying surface providing data and technical support for urban flood control and drainage grimaldi et al 2020 with the continuous breakthrough of remote sensing technology the application of high resolution digital terrain remote sensing images dems has effectively improved the accuracy of urban flood disaster estimation liu et al 2023 young et al 2020 compared with traditional research methods based on hydrological and historical data satellite remote sensing images also have spatial scale advantages in identifying floodwater bodies for example based on the landsat 8 image multiband water index algorithm the k means clustering method is used to automatically extract a large area of urban surface floods and analyze flood disaster characteristics wang et al 2017 therefore remote sensing satellites have the natural advantages of large scale and high accuracy and have great application potential in the field of urban rainstorm and flood research xing et al 2023 however due to the limitation of the regression cycle there is a time difference between the transit time of satellite remote sensing and the occurrence time of urban rainstorms and floods the space time mismatch of remote sensing data in monitoring urban rainstorms and flood disasters is more prominent li et al 2014 how to effectively solve the time scale contradiction of remote sensing data in urban rainstorm and flood research is a key problem however with the rapid development of computer information science and network technology the number of internet users has increased rapidly the number of internet users in china has reached 1 032 billion and the internet penetration rate has reached 73 0 sheng and li 2018 the huge internet crowd has created a lot of valuable data experts in the industry use natural language processing nlp technology to mine a large amount of key information on urban rainstorms and floods in the form of word embedding including glove word2vec and other models from internet text data build a visual knowledge map of urban rainstorms and flood word vectors and serve for urban rainstorm and flood disaster risk prediction time space characteristics analysis and research calculations of flood loss lu et al 2018 yang et al 2022 in urban rainstorm and flood events unstructured internet data have high timeliness and rich content which is conducive to multilevel social behavior characterization and mining the internal relationship between floods and disaster losses however internet text information is vague in describing the spatial location of urban rainstorms and flood disasters and lacks spatial topological extensibility as a result internet text information is not sufficient to reveal the dynamic evolution mechanism of urban rainstorms and floods and accurately quantify the disaster scope and degree of disaster loss yang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 then the text information on the internet is more scattered and incomplete than the data provided by professional monitoring platforms these problems greatly affect the application of internet text information in urban flood distribution and disaster loss estimation additionally the credibility of internet text information is difficult to quantify and determine which further affects the use and development of internet text information internet text information is harder to effectively apply in the research field of urban flood evolution and disaster loss therefore the traditional monomodal data method cannot break through the technical bottleneck in the current research field of urban rainstorms and flood disasters how to fuse various modal data scientifically and effectively to study urban rainstorms and flood disasters and realize the complementary advantages of data at the space time scale relevant theories and technologies urgently need to be addressed based on this we can use the internet and social media to extract disaster text information and assist satellite remote sensing data for disaster analysis in urban areas of henan yang et al 2022 liu et al 2018 additionally by integrating remote sensing and social media data it can be used to monitor weather driven urban rainstorms floods and other natural disasters in urban areas wang et al 2018 in addition to social media text information we can also explore the spatial and temporal distribution of natural disasters such as floods in henan cities by mining text information such as news and the research results are helpful to reasonably formulate risk prevention plans liu et al 2018 however remote sensing and text data are difficult to fuse due to their different modalities and scales at present there is a lack of models and theories related to urban flood losses calculation that integrate remote sensing and text data moreover the fusion technology and methods for different modal data are also key and difficult points in the field of flood disaster research he et al 2023 therefore this study proposed a disaster loss calculation model of urban flood bimodal data fusion based on space time information complementation of remote sensing and text which was used to analyze and calculate the disaster loss under the spatiotemporal evolution of floods in urban areas of henan first by combining the advantages of remote sensing large spatial scale high pixel accuracy and internet text data high timeliness large amount of social multilevel interactive information at spatial and temporal scales the remote sensing and text bimodal data coupling inversion of rainstorm spatial and temporal distributions is realized then based on the internet text information mined by nlp technology and coupled with the remote sensing spectrum a natural social multiparty subject behavior reiteration map of urban rainstorms and floods on the spatiotemporal scale was constructed to expound the objective law of flood disasters finally the ufcli model of remote sensing and text based bimodal data fusion is established to calculate the loss of rainstorms and flood disasters verify the accuracy of the model and demonstrate the applicability and scientificity of the ufcli model this study can provide theoretical support for accurate flood resilience in urban areas and other efforts and provide new ideas for accurate estimation of flood hazards on a regional scale and it provides a typical reference for other urban area studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area henan province is in the central region of china with east longitudes of 110 21 116 39 e and north

7 km² the province has developed water systems and transportation networks liu et al 2017 shi et al 2022 in recent years the gross domestic product gdp of henan province has ranked among the top five in china with rapid economic development and a gradually increasing urbanization scale henan is an important economic province in china chang et al 2022 the annual rainfall is concentrated between june and september due to the large population in the province the total asset value per unit area and population density of major cities increase year by year and the urban flood disaster risk shows an upward trend liu et al 2017 chang et al 2022 from the perspective of physical geography environment and conditions in henan province it is similar to most cities in china in addition the case of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan used this time is a once in a thousand years rainstorm event and the daily rainfall in zhengzhou city henan province is more than 500 mm the urban flood disaster caused by a rainstorm has a wide range of impacts and huge losses and the flood control and drainage defects in the process of urban construction and development are more obvious based on the data from this rainstorm event the calculated results of the constructed model are easier to verify by calculating and analyzing typical cases we can fully understand the key parameters of urban flood disaster losses and apply the constructed model to other urban areas such as beijing guangzhou etc which is also more accurate and easier zhai and lee 2023 2 2 access to data and materials based on the multimodal fusion model of the multidimensional remote sensing spectrum and internet text data many multimodal data are needed to restore the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan explore the spatial temporal linkage of urban rainstorms and floods and realize efficient and accurate rainstorm and flood disaster loss calculations text data come from internet sources such as weibo baidu and government announcements the gdp data of cities in henan province are collected through the 2020 henan statistical yearbook and internet text data and the paper text data were processed electronically

html text big data such as the internet can be standardized through computer programming and multidimensional remote sensing spectral images can be preprocessed for geometric and atmospheric correction coordinate conversion and geographical registration 2 3 methods 2 3 1 theoretical model of the glove word vector word vector word embedding transforms natural language words into vectors

specific derivation process and parameter meaning which will not be repeated in the text in this study at different stages of the flooding disaster the government the media the public and various social groups through the internet platform publish real time important information such as text descriptions related to the disaster site with personal location information pictures and video displays real time evolutionary data of disasters is shared from different dimensions and text information is forwarded in large volume easily and widely disseminated hence based on electronic text data about the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan on the internet july 19 july 22 baidu weibo government documents etc this study constructed the glove keyword of the july 20 rainstorm event in henan province and divided the part of speech categories through the statistical distribution of word frequency through the glove model 2 3 2 model of kruskal algorithm as one of the minimum spanning tree mst algorithms the kruskal algorithm is often used to build weighted graphs to effectively solve practical problems as shown in the schematic diagram of the assignment process in fig 2a the algorithm finds the support trees with the minimum weight through the connected weighting network and establishes the minimum spanning tree the implementation flow of kruskal s algorithm is shown in fig 2b andrew 2009 nicolas et al 2008 2 3 3 jaccard similarity coefficient the jaccard similarity coefficient jsc is applied to clustering similarity and difference analysis of limited sample text data jaccard 1912 fan et al 2019 based on the jaccard distance 1 d j jsc complement describe the dissimilarity between sets d j the jaccard distance is inversely proportional to the sample similarity as shown in formulas 3 and 4 given two sets a and b jsc is defined as the ratio of the size of the intersection of a and b and the size of the union of a and b jaccard 1912 3 j a b a b a b a b a b a b 4 d j a b 1 j a b a b a b a b a b a b where when sets a and b are empty j a b is defined as 1 d j a b is the jaccard distance of sets a and b and the symmetric difference a b a b a b therefore when j a b is smaller the higher the overlap intersection of sets a and b it indicates that the higher the similarity of the sample data text data 2 3 4 model of self organizing map feature mapping kohonen 1981 finland proposed a self organizing feature mapping sofm neural network based on a fully connected neuron array which can realize unsupervised self organizing learning data coding and clustering as shown in fig 3 the sofm neural network combines the input layer sample receiving function the number of neurons is n and the competition layer sample classification function the number of neurons is m m² connect the implementation flow of the sofm neural network is shown in fig 3b kohonen and mäkisara 1989 kohonen 1997 the sofm neural network operation process is as follows 1 weight

input vector to realize data classification calculation 2 3 5 flood loss model of remote sensing pixels based on the remote sensing inversion of the affected area of a large scale watershed the total economic loss was determined according to the comprehensive flood loss index per unit area and the calculation formula is duan et al 2022 13 l dp β rs a 14 a i 1 n f i 15 β rs a 1 α γ β where l dp is the direct economic loss from flooding β rs is the direct loss per unit area which is jointly calculated by light remote sensing and gdp a is the area of flood disaster f i is the i th pixel of the remote sensing spectrum n is the number of pixels and the size of each pixel can be calculated according to the resolution of remote sensing data β is the annual loss per unit area of historical flood disaster level a is the conversion coefficient which is estimated according to the fitting of the remote sensing brightness value of light and α is the empirical coefficient of flood damage generally taken as 0 04 and γ times of power duan et al 2022 the multidimensional remote sensing spectrum was introduced into the flood loss calculation model and the pixel was taken as the calculation unit to effectively improve the inundation area a and the direct economic loss per unit area β rs solution accuracy the normalized difference water index ndwi proposed by mcfeeters was used to interpret flood disaster water images in henan province huang and zhang 2021 ashok et al 2021 16 ndwi green nir green nir where green is the green band of remote sensing images and nir is the near infrared of remote sensing images see references huang et al 2021 and ashok et al 2021 for specific parameters 2 3 6 construction of the remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model in the traditional calculation method of flood losses in hydrology and hydrodynamics the calculation scale is small due to the limited data range moreover it overlooks the real time and rich data information provided by the internet s big data on urban floods in various aspects however there were limitations in internet text data such as insufficient spatial information about urban flood disasters and a lack of disaster loss degree data remote sensing data is limited by the regression period and lacks information on the temporal continuity of disaster events in the short term yang et al 2022 therefore the urban flood comprehensive loss index ufcli of remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion is constructed to carry out bimodal data fusion and quantification of urban rainstorm and flood disasters break data barriers and improve the scope timeliness and accuracy of urban flood disaster loss estimation based on the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan internet text mining and remote sensing inversion we obtained the spatial temporal distribution and disaster damage results of urban rainstorms and floods as shown in fig 4 first using internet text data and based on the giove model combined with the krusal jsc and sofm algorithms we conducted information mining on urban flood disasters at high time scales using multi dimensional remote sensing data combined with the ndwi normalized difference water index and a flood damage model calculate the losses of urban flood disasters at a high spatial scale duan et al 2022 then this study selected the respective characteristic indicators of bimodal data text economic status gdp total rainfall p hourly maximum rainfall p h word frequency of city name n and number of victims n remote sensing flood disaster area a terrain elevation difference h remote sensing loss estimation β and the urban flood comprehensive loss index ufcli based on remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion were constructed through the normalization of bimodal data indicators next internet text data are used to mine the high time scale information of urban flood disasters and based on the ufcli evaluation system combined with the spatial scale advantages of multiremote sensing satellite data a multidimensional remote sensing internet text bimodal data fusion model was constructed the spatial temporal linkage of urban rainstorm and floods was explored and efficient and accurate estimations of rainstorms and flood disaster losses were achieved finally the ufcli index and related model are used to quantitatively evaluate and verify the accuracy of the estimation results of urban flood losses the establishment process is as follows 17 y i k x i k max x i k where x i k is the i th index of the kth city max x i k is the maximum value of the i th index of the kth city and y i k is the normalization of the ith index of the kth city y 0 1 let a 1 a 2 a n be different index weights then the multimodal urban flood comprehensive loss degree ufcli is 18 ufcli k 1 m i 1 n a i y i k weight in power a 1 a 2 a n and a 1 a 2 a n 1 then a i 1 n eq 18 can be expressed as 19 ufcli 1 n k 1 m i 1 n x i k max x i k based on the ufcli multi index evaluation system and the above models a remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model was constructed the ufcli index was used to optimize the remote sensing inversion of direct economic losses β rs finally the bimodal data fusion based on ufcli was obtained to estimate the direct economic loss of flood disasters β ufcli the calculation model is as follows 20 β ufcli i 1 n k β rs where k is the proportion coefficient and the official statistical value of direct economic loss that can be mined from text β t is calculated by linear regression with the ufcli index 3 results 3 1 keyword extraction and collinear network establishment the results of glove keyword part of speech categories for the july 20 rainstorm event in zhengzhou henan are shown in fig 5b nouns proper nouns adjectives adverbs verbs and designated words accounted for 49 85 12 49 0 97 2 93 22 and 11 76 respectively according to the data calculated from the proportion of parts of speech nouns verbs and proper nouns play an absolutely dominant role in the acquisition of textual subject information accounting for more than 80 therefore in the process of keyword mining flood text some invalid high frequency words such as of and also or too can be appropriately removed according to the part of speech after optimization the word cloud is drawn as shown in fig 5a in the word cloud picture the contents of july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan are complex among which henan zhengzhou extraordinary storm flood disaster economic loss and casualties are the most frequent in addition time related high frequency words such as on july 20 on july 21 and on july 22 provide important time node information about rainstorm disasters the data based on internet electronic text big data mining show that the torrential rain centered on zhengzhou henan province and the broad masses of the country are highly concerned about the damage and impact of disaster events to further explore the internal relationship between the glove keyword and july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan a collinear network of july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan vocabulary was constructed based on jsc theory and the kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm as shown in fig 5c glove keyword extracts five main subgraphs for information exchange and the set composed of each subgraph expresses the subject of july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan among them the five main subgraphs fig 5c represent the evolution of rainstorm events urban infrastructure government regulation scientific and technological support and flood insurance payout 3 2 spatiotemporal coupling of rainstorms based on remote sensing and text internet text data have the characteristics of real time updates wide sources various information high temporal resolution and low spatial resolution however the initial information in internet text data events is incomplete such as the specific rainfall range and rainfall in various regions and the information cannot be expressed intuitively comparatively speaking the measured data of remote sensing and meteorological stations has good continuity accuracy and spatial scalability but the data acquisition time lags the internet to solve the inherent contradictions of internet text remote sensing and meteorological station measured data the advantages of time scale and spatial scale in different modal data were combined this study was based on the mining and extraction of the text data of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan on the internet and restored the time axis of the flood event according to the high frequency time keywords in fig 5a using the vocabulary collinear network of text mining and five main subgraphs fig 5c combined with dem elevation satellite remote sensing images and henan rainfall data text mining and site download a remote sensing and text coupled spatial temporal distribution topology map of rainstorms was constructed as shown in fig 6 text data provide a detailed accurate and complete time axis of flood events from the time scale remote sensing data provide the large scale distribution and evolution characteristics of rainfall in the province on a spatial scale based on the complementary advantages of time space scales of remote sensing and text data the dynamic evolution process of rainstorm and flood events is reproduced in different time periods by using the word cloud map fig 5a word collinear network grouping the appearance time points of five main subgraphs fig 5c and remote sensing rainfall distribution images of key rainfall durations as shown in fig 6 based on the evolution time axis of rainstorm and flood events combined with the spatial and temporal distribution of different rainfall stages retrieved by remote sensing and the five main subgraphs of the vocabulary collinear network of internet text mining a complete spatiotemporal multisubject interaction process of july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan coupled by remote sensing and text is constructed based on the coupled processing of remote sensing and text bimodal data the topological map fig 6 of the dynamic evolution and spatial and temporal distribution of urban rainstorm and flood events in henan province is explained in detail as follows first in the stage of rainfall some experts use science and technology subgraph scientific and technical support to predict rainstorms local government departments subgraph government guidance make flood control plans according to the evolution of rainstorm events expert technical guidance and real time dynamic situations of rainstorms second in the flood stage caused by rainstorms zhengzhou was high in the southwest and low in the northeast with a large terrain elevation difference the drainage system of the underlying surface does not match the rapid urbanization which accelerated the confluence of rainwater and aquatic products on the ground causing serious floods subgraph urban infrastructure governments at all levels and social organizations conduct comprehensive flood control and disaster relief the news media report real time disaster situations and statistical data providing a data basis for the formulation of the next step of work such as flood fighting and disaster relief then at the end of the rainfall and flooding the economic losses and maximum rainfall values of each city were announced one after another the cbirc china banking and insurance regulatory commission held a press conference subgraph flood insurance payout to report on disaster losses and flood insurance compensation finally at the stage of investigation and summary the july 20 torrential rain disaster investigation report was officially released which summarized the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan in detail in the form of text in summary first we build a coupled spatial temporal distribution of urban rainstorms by complementing the advantages of remote sensing and text data at the spatial temporal scale then combined with the collinear network drawn by the keyword vector of text mining fig 5 a natural social multiagent behavior interaction diagram fig 6 of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan on a spatiotemporal scale was constructed to explain the objective laws of flood disasters finally the lag of remote sensing data and the discontinuity of text data are effectively solved the bimodal coupling of remote sensing and text data is completed and the recurrence of urban rainstorm and flood disaster events and the characterization of spatiotemporal dynamic evolution are realized 3 3 estimation of disaster loss based on the ufcli index the calculation process of rainstorm and flood disaster loss based on the multidimensional remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model is as follows data acquisition data processing data result verification and verification of the calculation accuracy of the ufcli flood disaster loss model of data bimodal fusion 4 steps as shown in fig 7 first multidimensional remote sensing spectral images modis remote sensing dem elevation remote sensing and dmsp night light remote sensing were obtained and the data layer pixels were calibrated based on the photosensitive spectrum image the flood disaster area was interpreted in combination with the ndwi water index and the data preprocessing is complete fig 7a then massive text data of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan were collected through the internet weibo baidu etc and the text data format was standardized for the convenience of subsequent data processing fig 7b next based on remote sensing spectral images henan flood zoning fig 7c and light remote sensing spatial distribution fig 7d were constructed to carry out light remote sensing urban economy flood disaster spatial coupling inversions fig 7c 7d and 7f the standardized text information data are deeply mined by glove keywords and the comprehensive loss degree of flood disasters was calculated according to the urban economic status gdp total rainfall p and flood disaster scope a the sofm self organizing mapping neural network fig 7e was used to construct the comprehensive disaster grade zoning as shown in fig 7g it was divided into grades i v and i represents the most serious grade then remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion fig 7h were used to realize the bimodal fusion and visualization of urban flood disaster data fig 7f and 7g finally based on the multidimensional remote sensing and internet text bimodal fusion data combined with the remote sensing pixel flood loss model the ufcli index system was constructed formula 19 additionally remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion were completed to estimate the disaster loss degree of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan as shown in table 1 the sofm zoning was consistent with the flood area and disaster damage results retrieved by the remote sensing of cities in henan province the flood area of cities in henan province was approximately 5982 8 km² the direct economic loss was 120 06 billion yuan according to the result of text mining and 113 04 billion yuan according to the result of remote sensing calculations and a total of 398 people were killed zhengzhou was the main battlefield for flood fighting and disaster relief and the urban flood area was approximately 829 8 km² the direct economic loss was 40 9 billion yuan according to the result of text mining and 43 18 billion yuan according to the result of remote sensing calculation the economic loss of the zhengzhou flood disaster under text mining accounts for 34 of the province and the remote sensing calculation is 38 a total of 380 people were killed in zhengzhou accounting for 95 5 of the province the remaining cities were ranked by sofm zoning and disaster damage volume and the disaster losses in luoyang nanyang xuchang zhoukou and xinxiang are relatively serious the urbanization economy gdp is large area a and the direct loss per unit area β is aggravated it is not difficult to see from the results in table 1 that the direct economic losses of flood disasters extracted or retrieved by different modes of text and remote sensing were different the official text data are highly reliable but the direct economic loss of text data mining is relatively serious therefore we calculated the ufcli index according to the text remote sensing bimodal data parameters and combined it with model 19 then using the ufcli index and model 20 the direct economic loss is corrected β ufcli based on the remote sensing inversion results finally based on remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion the lack of text data was filled and the accuracy of the disaster loss results from remote sensing inversion was optimized and calibrated 3 4 accuracy verification of the bimodal data fusion model based on the ufcli index there are structural differences between different modal data sets and direct comparison lacks a scientific basis to verify the effect of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model on improving the accuracy of remote sensing data it is necessary to quantitatively analyze the differences between text and different modal remote sensing data most of the specific statistical data about flood disasters comes from government announcements official media and measured data published by local scientific research and meteorological institutions therefore text mining data are used as the standard to compare the differences between text and remote sensing unimodal data first the data parameters of text mining urban gdp total rainfall hourly maximum rainfall number of deaths frequency of urban occurrence and remote sensing flood disaster area terrain elevation difference remote sensing disaster damage estimation are normalized according to formula 19 then a remote sensing and text regression model was established as shown in fig 8a the overall trend of text and remote sensing data inversion is the same as that of the 7 20 rainstorm and flood disaster in henan r² 0 72 rss 0 19 f 41 35 however from the comparison of data at various points there were obvious differences between text and remote sensing monomodal data and the regression coefficient r² 0 72 0 8 the calculation results showed that although remote sensing data have spatial advantages the accuracy of remote sensing monomodal data was low therefore it was necessary to fuse text data to improve accuracy the ufcli bimodal data fusion model breaks the barriers of different modal data and the integrated evaluation system was more objective and comprehensive in the evolution of the spatiotemporal scale of flood disasters therefore based on the ufcli bimodal data fusion model this study completed the fusion of high precision text mining indicators and remote sensing inversion indicators then the spatial and temporal characteristics and disaster losses of flood disasters in different cities were studied through the ufcli index finally the severity of urban flood disasters was described and the accuracy of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model was verified the accuracy evaluation indicators are shown in table 2 1 the ufcli text regression model was established through the calculated value of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model and the normalized text mining data parameters as shown in fig 8b and table 2 r² 0 96 rss 0 03 f 396 59 and mape 0 53 this shows that the deviation between the calculated value of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model and the data value of text mining is low and the calculation effect of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model was good 2 the calculated value of the ufcli bimodal data fusion model and the normalized remote sensing inversion data parameters are used to establish a regression model and verify that r² 0 88 rss 0 08 f 114 12 and mape 1 41 according to the calculation and analysis r² increased by 0 08 rss decreased by 0 05 f increased by 282 47 and mape decreased by 0 88 the results showed that the ufcli bimodal data fusion model can effectively improve the accuracy of remote sensing inversion 4 discussions different modal information data have unique advantages and disadvantages internet text time scale and remote sensing data spatial scale show the spatial temporal characteristics of urban flood disasters from different perspectives bimodal data information complements and verifies each other enriching the expression of disaster related information yang et al 2022 liu et al 2018 4 1 the role of text mining in urban flooding internet text information can quickly obtain the basic data of the initial stage of urban flood events with the development of urban flooding text information has a strong ductility of time which provides important data support for urban flood control and disaster reduction work and personnel and material scheduling yang et al 2019 the network text contains rich disaster information which has the advantages of high timeliness and rich disaster information compared with remote sensing data yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 li et al 2021 through internet text data mining the main subgraphs and the glove keywords contained in each subgraph as shown in fig 5 can be reproduced interactively for the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan according to fig 6 first according to meteorological monitoring henan will have large scale high intensity rainfall and individuals and relevant government departments will prepare for flood fighting and disaster reduction second there are differences in the geographical and historical conditions urbanization and economic development level of the underlying surface in henan counties cities districts under the condition of heavy rainfall the rainfall at multiple stations in henan province broke through the historical extreme value causing floods of varying degrees in various regions as rainstorms continue flood disasters have brought about serious property losses and casualties governments at all levels from the central to local levels went deep into the disaster areas for the first time cooperated with existing scientific and technological means to carry out investigation and guidance and carried out flood relief cheng et al 2019 finally according to the scale of the disaster and the degree of damage government departments helped henan cities with post disaster reconstruction in addition with the participation of the china banking and insurance regulatory commission the insurance company s flood insurance compensation process should be supervised the above analysis shows that the july 20 henan rainstorm and flood event flood relief is the result of the joint efforts of many parties the internet and mass media information data have high practical value in the field of flood disaster research wu et al 2019 therefore big data mining based on internet electronic text will quickly and accurately obtain flood disaster event information on a large scale and provide data support for government rescue scheduling accurate flood fighting and other work rosser et al 2017 4 2 the role of remote sensing inversion in urban flooding remote sensing data has strong spatial scale information which intuitively records static plane images of urban areas before and after flood disasters occur provide data basis for urban flood control construction planning regional disaster reduction and safety layout etc moreover remote sensing inversion of disaster losses has fewer parameters than traditional calculation methods makes data easy to obtain covers a wide range of data and saves a lot of human resources in data collection through multidimensional remote sensing multiple categories of two dimensional data images can be obtained such as terrain and geomorphology administrative boundaries lighting and economic distribution urban community scope etc liu et al 2023 however the data range obtained by traditional manual and instrument measurements is too small to support the study of flood damage at the urban scale henry et al 2018 duan et al 2022 therefore by using remote sensing data to invert the impact range of urban flood disasters combined with remote sensing inversion models the disaster losses of each remote sensing pixel can be calculated and the disaster damage information of specific locations can be preliminarily estimated as shown in fig 7a the two dimensional distribution map of flood disaster losses retrieved from remote sensing data is shown however remote sensing data has a time interval and in order to more accurately and timely invert the results of urban flood damage it is necessary to combine internet text data with time scale advantages and easy access building a flood disaster loss calculation model through data fusion will help improve the accuracy of urban flood disaster inversion in terms of time and space further improve computational efficiency xing et al 2023 4 3 discussion on the regularity of urban flooding with bimodal data there were limitations in the text data on the internet such as insufficient spatial information about urban flood disasters and a lack of disaster loss degree data yang et al 2022 therefore in this study we propose the ufcli index and build a remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model fig 7 then by effectively using and combining the advantages of the time scale of the text and the spatial scale of remote sensing data the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan are mutually verified and complementary and the spatiotemporal linkage of urban floods is discussed in depth fig 6 and fig 7 yang et al 2022 rosser et al 2017 4 3 1 disaster characterization of urban rainstorms and floods with different modal data typical text mining data total rainfall p hourly maximum rainfall p h and typical remote sensing inversion data dem poster height h flood disaster area a was selected for discussion rainfall p shown in fig 9a is a necessary and insufficient condition for rainstorms to cause flood disasters according to the calculation data in table 1 there is a positive correlation between rainfall p and flood disaster area next through remote sensing dem images the terrain elevation difference of urban areas in henan province is calculated then we established a regression model between poster height h and flood disaster area a as shown in fig 9b the regression progress verification results are r² 0 74 mae 24 22 rmse 22 22 f 45 87 and p 0 05 the calculation results show that the greater the terrain elevation difference of the city is the greater the formation of rainstorms and flood disasters the greater the difference in urban altitude is the higher the risk of floods caused by rainstorms the wider the scope of disasters and the more serious property losses li et al 2012 4 3 2 spatial and temporal characterization of urban flooding by sofm and ufcli important parameters in ufcli such as urban development scale total gdp flood affected area a and the number of victims n are closely related to sofm flood zoning showing a positive correlation as shown in fig 10a taking zhengzhou as an example the urban development scale is the largest the total gdp is the highest the terrain elevation difference h is large the flood affected area a is the highest the death toll is the highest 380 people and the sofm flood zoning level is the highest therefore the sofm and ufcli characterize the temporal and spatial correlation of parameters between urban rainstorms and flood disasters although p and p h surpass the historical extreme value the once in a thousand years heavy rain is an important cause of flood disasters however other disaster causes such as urbanization topographic factors imperfect structural measures and nonstructural measures cannot be ignored therefore in urban rainstorm and flood disaster events the different parameters of each modal data are correlated in the spatiotemporal evolution of urban flood disasters by constructing the flood disaster comprehensive loss index ufcli evaluation system we explore the spatial temporal linkage of urban rainstorms and floods and the objective factors that cause flood disasters combining the space time scale advantages of remote sensing and text bimodal data a ufcli flood damage regression model fig 8 and fig 9b was established to carry out efficient and accurate quantitative analysis and evaluation of the space time evolution of rainstorms and floods and disaster damage calculations it provided theoretical and technical support for exploring the occurrence and development temporal and spatial distribution and loss estimation of urban flood disasters in conclusion according to the analysis of dual mode time space characteristic parameters of remote sensing and text rainfall is an insufficient and necessary condition for urban rainstorms to cause flood disasters in addition to rainfall p economic scale gdp and altitude difference h are key parameters of urban flood disasters when rainfall exceeds the water storage and drainage capacity of the urban underlying surface the excessive water volume cannot be properly controlled threatening the normal operation of the city and the safety of people and property and flooding will occur in the short term it is difficult to significantly improve the flood standard of engineering measures so nonengineering measures can be reasonably used for urban flood prevention and mitigation this study attempted to combine multidimensional remote sensing to obtain a high spatial resolution vector data network and propose the flood disaster comprehensive loss index ufcli then a remote sensing and text bimodal fusion model was constructed to solve the problem of missing text monomodal data and spatial scale ambiguity as shown in table 1 statistical data of direct economic losses of the internet finally the inversion accuracy of the calibrated remote sensing monomodal data table 2 was improved to realize the complementary advantages of the spatial temporal scale of the dataset this study provides a new idea for the accurate and efficient estimation of large scale flood damage 5 conclusions to realize the information complementation of remote sensing and text on the space time scale under the complex spatiotemporal evolution of henan urban rainstorms and floods large scale disaster losses can be accurately calculated additionally the shortcomings of traditional urban flood disaster research methods such as low precision and small scale were solved theoretically and technically first based on the research on the topology of the internet text glove network the analysis of the collinear network and combined with remote sensing dem and other data we constructed the spatiotemporal distribution of urban rainstorms with remote sensing and text coupling the spatiotemporal evolution and distribution of the july 20 rainstorm and flood event in henan were successfully excavated and the spatiotemporal scale of the rainstorm event was restored and reconstructed then based on the ufcli index system a bimodal data fusion model of multielement remote sensing and internet text was constructed finally based on the remote sensing and text bimodal data fusion model of the ufcli index rainstorm flood damage is calculated and its accuracy is verified the main conclusions were as follows 1 using remote sensing data coupled with common line network text information combined with inversion of the spatiotemporal distribution of heavy rainfall a spatiotemporal evolution map of heavy rainfall and flooding events can be effectively established the spatiotemporal evolution and distribution analysis of urban flooding shows that there are obvious natural social multi factor interactions in the spatiotemporal scale of storm flooding events the coupled analysis of remote sensing and text bimodal data further realizes a comprehensive replication of the storm flooding events at the spatial and temporal scales 2 based on the ufcli index system a bimodal data fusion model was constructed to realize the complementation of text remote sensing spatiotemporal information the accuracy verification effect of through analysis and calculation shows that the ufcli text regression model was good r² 0 96 rss 0 03 f 396 59 mape 0 53 the ufcli fusion model effectively improves the accuracy of flood disaster loss inversion from remote sensing single mode data r² increased by 0 08 rss decreased by 0 05 f increased by 282 47 and mape decreased by 0 88 3 the main problem faced in this study is that it does not combine multiple types of remote sensing such as spectral and radar data fusion and other data sets to avoid cloud occlusion from affecting the inversion results and we did not conduct credibility related evaluations of internet text data nor did we integrate more valuable data such as images and videos in the future based on the method of this study the integration of radar remote sensing as well as video and image information is considered to improve the data accuracy and compare with other fusion methods to further optimize the structure of ufcli model and the rationality of parameters and build a multimodal data fusion model of text remote sensing images video 4 the results of this study achieve efficient and accurate urban storm flood damage estimation in urban areas of henan this for provides guidance for accurate flood fighting and rescue in urban areas of henan and can provide typical reference for accurate flood damage estimation in other urban

7673,study region the study uses 78 groundwater head time series across 10 european countries with various geological and hydrological settings study focus the estimation of groundwater recharge using time series analysis and lumped modelling based on groundwater head time series is a low cost and practical method however lumped recharge estimation models based on groundwater level variations are uncertain and successful applications are known to depend on both climate and hydrogeological setting here we assess the suitability of three different models to estimate recharge metran transfer function noise model aquimod groundwater level driven hydrological model and gardénia lumped catchment model new hydrological insights results showed that while all three models generally did well during the modelling of groundwater heads the resulting recharge estimations from the models were different the analysis showed that the transfer noise modelling of groundwater heads with recharge and evapotranspiration in metran is not generally applicable for recharge estimation the addition of physical information in aquimod improved the recharge estimations but the reliability was still limited without control of the water balance due to non uniqueness by adding discharge information to the modelling gardénia can provide more reliable recharge values thus recharge estimation from groundwater head time series without water balance information must be considered uncertain with low precision but applicability can be improved when including knowledge of the local system keywords groundwater recharge lumped modelling time series analysis europe data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction knowledge about groundwater recharge and potential changes in a future climate is important for water resource management and the assessment of a sustainable use of groundwater e g alley et al 2002 margat and van der gun 2013 pulido velazquez et al 2020 this includes assessments of the water balance water availability contaminant transport nutrient loadings and groundwater quantitative and chemical status according to european directives and guidance european commission 2000 2006 2009 these aspects are all important to the implementation of the un sustainable development goals and to improve our understanding of the limits to the human use of groundwater without causing ecological damage steffen et al 2015 gleeson et al 2020 measuring and estimating groundwater recharge is not straightforward alley et al 2002 a large variety of methods exists for recharge assessment custodio 2019 e g in situ lysimeters water budget calculations including streamflow separation techniques analysis of groundwater head time series such as water table fluctuation methods lumped models or transfer noise modelling unsaturated zone modelling and integrated hydrological modelling scanlon et al 2002 healy 2010 sibanda et al 2009 because groundwater head time series are widely available analysis of groundwater head time series for recharge estimation has been applied extensively in the literature e g healy and cooke 2002 the methods often required very little data and can thus be setup in countries and locations where data coverages are lacking or insufficient for more data intense methods e g integrated modelling approaches while being very fast to create and deploy a fairly simple method is the water table fluctuation method e g crosbie et al 2005 which requires information on the specific yield which may not be known accurately other methods using groundwater heads can take into account boundary conditions and other processes e g abstraction that may affect the groundwater levels e g peterson and fulton 2019 uncertainties in recharge estimations based on heads are however often substantial delin et al 2007 nimmo et al 2015 if head are influenced by other factors while recharge is highly dependent on climate it is also dependent on surface and sub surface conditions thus the recharge estimate will depend not only on the input data but also on the recharge conditions and mechanisms and whether the selected model can represent these mechanisms satisfactorily lafare et al 2021 de vries and simmers 2002 recommend that water resources practitioners identify important features that influence recharge for a given location first and then apply a recharge calculation model that is suitable to actual field conditions it is possible that some model types may not be applicable under certain conditions or settings and therefore both governing features for recharge creation and appropriate model type may be difficult to immediately identify therefore de vries and simmers 2002 recommend applying and comparing multiple independent approaches to the same case study the focus of this paper is to investigate the potential use of recharge estimates from three structurally different groundwater head driven models across different climatic hydrological and geological settings in europe two of these models have been chosen as they have been used for seasonal groundwater head forecasts e g prudhomme et al 2017 and can be potentially used therefore to undertake recharge forecasts these models are the groundwater level driven hydrological model aquimod mackay et al 2014a and the lumped catchment model gardénia thiéry 2015a in order to apply a third different model type it was chosen to test the recharge produced by a transfer noise model metran zaadnoordijk et al 2019 because this type of model is widely applied and it has been suggested that it can provide useful recharge estimates collenteur et al 2021 obergfell et al 2019 the objective of this paper is to investigate if the successful model calibration and simulation of observed groundwater head fluctuations are sufficient indication of reasonable groundwater recharge estimates and to explore possible limitations of their use we focus on diffuse recharge from precipitation and present a taxonomy based on literature nomenclature to classify the calculated values to enable a proper comparison due to lack of in situ measurements of recharge at the sites to verify or reject the recharge estimations the head driven model estimates are compared to recharge generated by other methods e g local and national hydrological or integrated models and a machine learning based european recharge map martinsen et al 2022 the head driven models employ contrasting approaches to assess recharge using groundwater heads precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as input and optionally surface water discharge and groundwater abstractions the concept of recharge considered by the various tools and approaches is not always the same making a comparison of results problematic flint et al 2002 barthel et al 2021 therefore this study also presents a taxonomy based on literature nomenclature for classifying the recharge estimates and identifies the different recharge types estimated by the applied tools it should be noted that the models estimate diffuse recharge occurring from infiltrating excess precipitation through the soil and unsaturated zone thus this recharge type is the focus here and return irrigation and repellency of soils on flat surfaces are not considered the paper is structured as follows first is the method section 2 including an overall description of the study sites across europe 2 1 followed by a description of the recharge taxonomy used in the paper 2 2 and the description of the models applied 2 3 the next section describes the calibration of and the experiences from four selected case studies 3 1 followed by the overall results of all the case studies investigated in the paper 3 2 and 3 3 the final sections of the paper include the discussion 4 and conclusions 5 the discussion and conclusions will be focused on first a comparison of the model s recharge estimations and performance and secondly identifying limitations and recommendations for models and approaches this work has been conducted by a group of european geological surveys during the geoera tactic project tactic 2021b 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study sites are distributed across europe fig 1 where time series of groundwater heads in 56 monitoring wells are included nine of these are multi screen wells and have groundwater head time series from multiple depths yielding a total of 78 time series for the analysis the sites have very different characteristics in terms of climate geology and hydrology an overview of the overall characteristics can be seen in table s1 in the electronic supplementary material esm the groundwater head time series have been chosen based on the availability of adequate data in terms of resolution length data gaps as well as representativity of the regional aquifer system instead of e g local pumping or surface water and availability of precipitation and evapotranspiration data no actual evapotranspiration was available and it was assumed that differences in determination of evapotranspiration values are accounted for by the models in the translation to actual evapotranspiration and do not influence the estimated recharge the study sites span a range of climatological settings each site has been assigned to a climatic zone and together they cover five out of the six climatic zones proposed by schneider et al 2013 the mediterranean group climatic zone m table s1 is characterized by high summer temperatures and mild winters often precipitation is predominantly during winter the four study sites in this group have a very high potential evapotranspiration 1000 mm y with examples of both high italy and low precipitation areas spain the next group is the temperate oceanic climatic zone to here the proximity to the coast means the precipitation is high for most of the year with mild winters and warm summers this group consists of the largest set of sites 47 in total the sites generally have precipitation between 800 and 900 mm y and experience potential evapotranspiration in the order of 600 mm y the temperate zone situated away from the oceans is the temperate continental zone climatic zone tc which generally has a larger contrast between winter and summer temperatures and precipitation occurring mainly during wintertime the four study sites located here have lower precipitation than in the oceanic area with precipitation around 600 700 mm y with one outlier of 850 mm y drava mura this group generally experiences potential evapotranspiration in the order of 700 mm y with over 900 mm y for serbia one study site lies in between these two temperate zones in the temperate transitional zone climatic zone tt and this zone is a mix of the preceding two zones i e with high seasonal contrast but precipitation occurring during all seasons geologically the aquifers at the sites are also very diverse table s1 most of the aquifers in this study are sedimentary aquifers comprising of porous media like silt sand and gravel or fissured sedimentary aquifers this accounts for 25 of the 56 sites four sites are alluvial aquifers with sand or gravel media and eight represent karstic environments with limestone observations from both unconfined and confined groundwater settings are present among the 78 groundwater head time series with a prevalence of unconfined times series 48 out of 78 the hydrology of the sites is generally not very affected by surface runoff tile drainage or rivers 20 of the sites are affected by one or more of the three for the sites where stream discharge data are available it was included in the modelling for ten site and not used for two sites where the applied tool does not use discharge or it is not relevant to include groundwater abstractions are present at only 6 sites and are always included in the modelling 2 2 definition of recharge types in a broad sense groundwater recharge is water that is added to the saturated zone meinzer 1923 more specifically recharge can be defined as the downward flow of water reaching the water table adding to groundwater storage as suggested by e g healy 2010a 2010b more loosely recharge is also sometimes defined as the downward flux of water towards the water table e g healy 2010a 2010b and fitts 2013 it is often divided into diffuse recharge from precipitation or irrigation and localized recharge from surface waters and wadis scanlon et al 2002 we focus on diffuse recharge from precipitation throughout the vertical migration of water in the soil column multiple subsurface processes influence the downward flux of water e g by storage change or evapotranspiration and change the amount of water accessible for further infiltration thus the recharge will differ depending on where in the subsurface the infiltrating water is considered as recharge and this taxonomy may therefore be unclear or imprecise staudinger et al 2019 none of these definitions include flow between groundwater systems where one aquifer may provide recharge to another to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of the recharge results from the tools used in this study and other sources this paper distinguishes three types of recharge based on the specific location in the hydrogeological system and linked to the water flow process involved before or at that location potential recharge recharge based on the definition by healy 2010a 2010b and inter aquifer leakage the three types are illustrated in fig 2 with the associated fluxes in the subsurface the vertical green arrows are the different recharge types decreasing if storage increases and water moves away with lateral flow the red box symbolizes losses near the surface due to processes such as surface runoff evapotranspiration including root uptake interception and soil evaporation affecting the soil moisture deficit together with precipitation these losses determine the potential recharge leaving the root zone potential recharge is equal to the water surplus arising from precipitation and irrigation after actual evapotranspiration and reducing the soil moisture deficit and surface runoff to surface water systems potential recharge has many terms in the literature and is also called percolation net infiltration or drainage see e g hendrickx and walker 1997 some of this potential recharge will be captured by the unsaturated zone storage restricting soil layers and interflow the remainder of the potential recharge reaches the groundwater table and becomes part of the saturated zone this recharge type is simply referred to as recharge the recharge is thus the gross amount of water that recharges the upper phreatic aquifer through the water table in a groundwater aquifer system with one or more confining layers there may be recharge to confined aquifer due to downward flow through an overlying confining aquitard this recharge type is termed inter aquifer leakage and will have a different hydraulic head response than the recharge type defined above this type covers all aquifers in the system that are underneath an aquitard and are not phreatic in a multi aquifer system there may be multiple recharge locations in case of perched conditions and multiple inter aquifer leakages in the case of multiple confined aquifers in that case it is necessary to specify the depth the recharge is associated with depending on the spatial resolution the schematisation of fig 2 does not capture all small scale processes especially small surface water bodies e g streams or gullies or tile drainage in that case infiltrating water may be drained to surface water depending on the method of evaluation it may then be impossible to separate the related fluxes from the surface runoff for potential recharge or the interflow for recharge 2 3 recharge estimation models three models are applied in this study to estimate the recharges metran aquimod and gardénia in table 1 a general overview is shown for the three models these time series or zero dimensional models are also introduced in subsections 2 3 1 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 respectively table 2 provides a summary of the conceptual representation of processes included in these models together with the number of parameters to be identified during calibration recharge estimates from these models are compared to results of measurements or models already present at the sites therefore a brief overview of the methods is included in section 2 3 4 2 3 1 transfer noise metran metran is a software program for modelling groundwater head time series using a transfer function noise approach with precipitation and reference evapotranspiration data zaadnoordijk et al 2019 the precipitation transfer function is a three parameter function based on the gamma distribution which is a unimodal function with a wide range of possible shapes see the parameters in table 2 the transfer function for the reference evapotranspiration is the same except for a multiplication factor referred to as the evapotranspiration factor fe the noise model is an autoregressive model with a single parameter the five resulting parameters of the applied metran models total size of precipitation response two shape parameters of the precipitation response evapotranspiration factor and decay parameter of the noise model have no direct physical meaning that can be used to evaluate the calibration metran runs on a webserver to provide models explaining the variation of groundwater heads in the dutch national database http www grondwaterstandeninbeeld nl it can also be used offline and with different explanatory variables and time series in various formats obergfell et al 2019 proposed a recharge r estimate based on such a time series model which is equal to the rainfall n minus the reference evapotranspiration e multiplied by the evapotranspiration factor fe 1 r n fe e this was found to give a reasonable estimate of the long term average recharge in an area with a phreatic aquifer without surface runoff and interflow obergfell et al 2019 in that case the potential recharge recharge and inter aquifer leakage recharge all have the same value the evapotranspiration factor fe was smaller than one indicating that the actual evapotranspiration was smaller than the reference evapotranspiration usually it is safe to assume that the actual evapotranspiration is not greater than the reference evapotranspiration this leads to the interpretation that a value of the evapotranspiration factor greater than one indicates loss of water e g due to drainage surface runoff or interflow to surface waters in this situation the factor fe is interpreted as the reduction of the precipitation contribution to recharge while the actual evapotranspiration is assumed to be equal to the reference evapotranspiration the latter assumption seems reasonable if the groundwater table is so close to the surface that drainage and surface runoff are important this gives the following approximation for recharge 2 r n fe e fe 1 3 r n fe e fe 1 2 3 2 groundwater level based hydrological model aquimod aquimod is a lumped numerical model that was originally developed to investigate the behaviour of a groundwater system the aim is to predict missing historical groundwater levels and calculate future groundwater levels mackay et al 2014a the model captures the conceptual understanding of a groundwater system using three numerical modules these represent the soil zone the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone water infiltration into the soil zone is calculated using the fao drainage and irrigation paper 56 fao 1998 approach as modified by griffiths et al 2006 the first module accounts for actual evapotranspiration from crops and the soil moisture deficit to calculate excess water from rainfall the excess water is split into infiltration and runoff the delay of infiltrated water movement within the unsaturated zone is controlled by the second module using a two parameter weibull probability density function finally the fluctuation of groundwater levels is simulated by the third module representing the saturated zone using an explicit numerical form of the mass balance equation the saturated zone can be represented by several vertically arranged aquifers to capture the conceptual understanding of the site a full description of the mathematical equations used to simulate the movement of water in these three zones is detailed by mackay et al 2014a and mackay et al 2014b this study focuses on the amount of water infiltration into the aquifer consequently the recharge estimated from aquimod is considered recharge or inter aquifer leakage the model is calibrated by changing the hydraulic parameter values included in the three modules an overview of the parameters can be seen in table 2 in aquimod all the hydraulic parameters have a physical meaning such as the root constant soil moisture at wilting point and at saturation hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient values of each compartment representing the saturated part of the aquifer only the flow with the unsaturated part of the aquifer is simulated using a mathematical equation which replicates the impact of the unsaturated zone on the groundwater flow the calibration is done using a monte carlo approach that produces several simulations that are equally acceptable these acceptable simulations are all used to calculate uncertainty bounds around the estimated recharge values 2 3 3 lumped catchment model gardénia the computer code gardénia modèle global a réservoirs pour la simulation des débits et des niveaux aquifères is a lumped hydrological model for the simulation of relationships between time series of stream or spring flow data at the outlet of a watershed and or groundwater level data at an observation well situated in the underlying aquifer unconfined aquifer and the rainfall received over the corresponding catchment groundwater abstractions can be considered if necessary the behaviour of an aquifer system is represented by a series of interconnected tanks non linear transfer functions improve the capability of this representation to simulate a complex system gardénia simulates the water cycle through a series of 3 or 4 connected tanks that represent respectively 1 the top few decimetres of soil that are subjected to the influence of evapotranspiration root zone 2 an intermediate zone of rapid flow or quick flow 3 one or two aquifer zones of delayed slow flow the outflow from one reservoir to another is controlled by simple laws specific to each reservoir these laws are governed by the model parameters active storage duration of outflow overflow threshold etc gardénia determines the hydrological balance for the basin actual evapotranspiration runoff infiltration and recharge the hydrological balance can be used for the evaluation of groundwater recharge to the groundwater table recharge gardénia also provides river flow groundwater level or recharge data over the period for which precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data are known one or two series of observations can be considered river flows at the basin outlet and or representative groundwater levels at an observation well located in the basin also taking impacts of groundwater or river abstraction into account calibration is done in a semi automatic way the user provides an initial set of parameters and indicates which parameters should be optimised see an overview of parameters in table 2 gardenia s hydraulic parameters have also a physical meaning similarly to aquimod but there are also linear equations that are used to control the movement of water in the subsurface and the parameters of which are optimised during calibration the model uses a non linear optimisation algorithm for calibration adopted from the rosenbrock method rosenbrock 1963 the model varies the chosen parameters within a range of values defined by the user and searches for the set which gives the best fit between observed and simulated values 2 3 4 performance evaluation as the three models are different so are the ways their performance is evaluated the performance of a metran model is expressed by three scores of 0 1 and 2 based on the model evaluation criteria given by zaadnoordijk et al 2019 a score of 0 indicates the model is not acceptable 1 that it is acceptable potentially useful and 2 that it fulfils additional criteria good the criteria are related to the explained variance independence of the noise part from the transfer part and the chance of overfitting the inability to fit an acceptable model can be due to any or all of the following conditions 1 a variable with an important influence on the groundwater heads was not included e g abstraction 2 non representative input data e g inadequate precipitation or evapotranspiration data 3 insufficient information in the calibration data or errors in groundwater heads 4 a linear response with the gamma response function cannot provide an adequate approximation of the groundwater system however to aid the comparison of the three models the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse see nash and sutcliffe 1970 of metran s groundwater level simulation have also been calculated the performance of aquimod is routinely evaluated using standard performance criteria such as the root square mean error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse see nash and sutcliffe 1970 performance measures while nse is used in gardénia to evaluate the performance of both groundwater heads and river discharge while many studies set criteria that relate the goodness of calibration to the nse values moriasi et al 2007 kalin et al 2010 kouchi et al 2017 there exist no standard values of nse used for the acceptance failing of aquimod simulations an nse value of 1 0 indicates a perfect match between the observed and simulated data in this study we consider aquimod simulations that achieve an nse score higher than 0 7 as good simulations that can capture the observed data behaviour those with nse score of 0 5 are still included as they simulated groundwater level time series show acceptable reflection of the observed ones for the gardénia model previous work bouanani et al 2012 jeannin et al 2021 and experience the performance of gardénia have showed that nse is deemed acceptable when it is above 0 7 good when above 0 8 and very good for nse values above 0 9 this criterion is also implemented here and gardénia simulations that produce nse values greater than 0 7 are accepted for analysis 2 3 5 other results used for comparison recharge results from models and measurements from other studies were also collected and used in this study for comparing and assessing recharge estimates the models are mostly from national modelling studies but some site specific model results are also available the model types are both hydrological and integrated hydrological models an overview of the additional results used is shown in table 3 the models will be described briefly in the following section but for more detailed information the reader is referred to the references given in table 3 in croatia recharge was estimated from lysimeter measurements patrčević 1995 and water balance analyses urumović et al 1981 brkić 1999 this recharge estimation has also been used as input in a modflow harbaugh et al 2000 model brkić et al 2021 modflow is a groundwater flow simulation program and needs groundwater recharge as input either as a calibration parameter or an input value time series instead of climate input e g precipitation

compartments where water is moved through the system using nine empirical parameters recharge is calculated as the water moving from the root zone storage to the groundwater storage and only represents recharge to the saturated zone type2 the model was set up and calibrated for three catchments containing the danish sites within the tactic project tactic 2021a hype is a semi distributed conceptual hydrological model which was developed in sweden and is now used as the national swedish hydrological model for discharge and nutrient loads s hype strömqvist et al 2012 the s hype model is used extensively in sweden and multiple uses have been well documented in this study the recharge in hype reflects percolation to the groundwater table type2 where the calculation of net precipitation employs a generalised empirical relationship for evapotranspiration that has been calibrated for the national model involving a water balance of c 400 catchments the sacramento model was used in spain where it provided the input of groundwater recharge type2 to the local modflow model setup for the upper guadiana basin collados lara et al 2021 surge 2018 the national recharge estimation tool the zooming object oriented distributed recharge model zoodrm is used in united kingdom mansour et al 2018 the model calculates recharge using characteristics of plant growth and water uptake as well as information on soil characteristics and climatic conditions the model operates on grid basis and covers the entire british mainland the hydrodynamic model of the chalk aquifer of the somme basin uses a finite difference groundwater modelling approach implemented in brgm s marthe code thiéry 2015b thiéry et al 2018 groundwater is the primary water resource for water supply in the french somme department hydrodynamic modelling of the somme basin amraoui et al 2004 is used to study the impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge to the chalky aquifer piezometric level fluctuations and streamflow to the drainage network amraoui 2019 like modflow marthe is a groundwater flow simulation program that needs groundwater recharge as input integrated hydrological models also form the basis of the national water resources model of denmark based on mike she and the netherlands based on modflow for groundwater de lange et al 2014 common to these models is the integrated calculation of unsaturated zone surface water and groundwater fluxes and they can therefore estimate all three recharge types water fluxes in the unsaturated zone are calculated based on e g richard s equation marthe or a 2 layer solver mike she the saturated zone fluxes are calculated by finite difference solving darcy equations for 3d groundwater flow the national application of the models is well documented in previous publications for the netherlands de lange et al 2014 and denmark højberg et al 2013 stisen et al 2019 also included is a local high resolution version of the dutch national model run for the catchment of deraam tactic 2021a the last tool used for comparison of recharge is a machine learning aided approach developed in the tactic project for the calculation of potential recharge type1 at a pan european scale martinsen et al 2022 the machine learning algorithm uses gridded national model estimates of infiltration coefficients as training data applying a range of explanatory variables to establish the governing variables for infiltration across europe the resulting infiltration coefficient map is then multiplied onto a european net precipitation map generated from the e obs precipitation dataset at 0 1 resolution and satellite data for evapotranspiration cornes et al 2018 in this study potential recharge is obtained for the grid location of the study sites more information on the method can be acquired from tactic 2021b 3 results 3 1 calibration results the performance of the models after calibration from the different study sites is presented in fig 3 as not all study sites have all three tools some areas are left blank on the graphs the metran model is applied for all 78 time series as seen in fig 3a 35 out of 78 time series have the best performing model fit score 2 while 31 are acceptable score 1 for a small group of 12 it was not possible to calibrate a usable metran model for the site score 0 for comparative reasons nse is shown by the bar height in the fig ure as can be seen a high nse is not always a guarantee for a good score and vice versa due to the two stage nature of the standard performance evaluation overall 31 of the metran models have nse values above 0 75 aquimod is applied to 40 time series in 37 study sites fig 3b most of the model runs 28 time series produce very high nse values 0 70 for the groundwater level while 7 sites produce nse values between 0 5 and 0 7 poorer performance was found for five sites in serbia denmark and ireland gardénia is used for 30 groundwater head time series fig 3c sixteen sites of these include stream discharge fig 3d generally performances are good with 19 time series for groundwater heads and ten time series for stream discharges having nse values larger than 0 70 and eight time series for groundwater heads and two time series for stream discharges with nse above 0 50 but below 0 70 performance deteriorates for four sites in ireland and in spain the calibration of the different models shows that there is not always a correspondence between when the models succeed or fail for time series where all three models are applied 22 time series 32 of the time series show that all succeed in making a reasonable calibration target for 10 time series one model fails to produce a reliable result while four time series only have one model succeeding out of three for the time series where two models are applied 29 time series both models are successful in 62 of the cases one of the two models fails in 11 of the cases there is thus seldom a correlation between the poor performance of the models there is also no clear tendency that it is always the same model that fails generally metran and aquimod have a fail rate of 15 and 10 respectively while gardénia fails in 37 of all applications 3 2 selected case studies to illustrate the modelling of recharge using the three models four case study sites are described in more details each case study illustrates and highlights different structural differences or limitations of one or all three models the case studies have been chosen both to illustrate important challenges with applying the models and to cover a range of geologies and climatologies across europe it should be noted that both aquimod and gardénia provide recharge time series while metran provides mean annual values of recharge a total of four contrasting cases are included here spain serbia ireland and sweden these will be briefly introduced in each section 3 2 1 south upper guadiana spain time series 78 the campo de montiel aquifer covers an area of nearly 2200 km2 located within a semiarid region in the upper guadiana basin spain it is mainly composed of limestones and jurassic carbonate formations its altitude varies between 800 and 1000 m asl the mean annual temperature is about 14 c annual precipitation varies between 400 and 500 mm the predominantly dry climate and the prevalence of irrigated agriculture mainly supplied with groundwater resources has led to a high and permanent conflict between agriculture and ecosystem conservation with significant impacts on the wetlands protected ramsar sites and aquifers quantity and quality in the past baena ruiz et al 2021 baena ruiz and pulido velazquez 2020 gardénia aquimod and metran modelling tools were employed to estimate groundwater recharge based on more than 35 years of available data from april 1978 to october 2015 in one piezometer the groundwater head time series fig 4a are from an unconfined aquifer and are related to recharge the mean recharge values fig 5a obtained with gardénia aquimod and metran are 69 4 mm year 69 8 mm year and 421 mm year respectively the differences between the mean recharge estimated by applying gardénia or aquimod with respect to site specific model 66 2 mm year table 1 are not significant maximum of 5 6 meanwhile the mean recharge obtained with metran is significantly greater metran was run for 10 time series in the basin but only succeeded in producing a model for one even though this model passed the statistical test it has been also dismissed as it has almost no evapotranspiration response indicating that groundwater fluctuations are independent of evapotranspiration the long time series make it possible to perform a sensitivity analysis of the results for the period of data employed to calibrate and validate the gardénia and aquimod models three calibration scenarios were carried out using the entire dataset and 70 and 50 of the period while the rest of the dataset was reserved for validation table 3 shows the mean recharge in the period 1978 2015 and the goodness of fit in the simulated groundwater levels obtained for different calibration scenarios both models provide similar mean recharge values and acceptable results in groundwater level forecast in this case study most aquimod models provide a slightly better simulation of groundwater level than gardénia although the estimated recharge provided by gardénia is more similar to the site specific model table 4 fig s1 of the electronic supplementary material esm shows the observed and simulated groundwater levels obtained with the different calibrated models in the period 1978 2015 it shows that both models gardénia and aquimod have the ability to reproduce groundwater levels within the different validation periods therefore in addition to assessing groundwater recharge they can be employed as tools for short term groundwater level forecasting 3 2 2 east posavina serbia time series 76 borehole affected by river stage the pilot area posavina is situated in the sava river basin in serbia and is mostly covered with quaternary sediments this area stretches from the border with croatia on the west to belgrade in the east and from fruška gora mountain in the north to cer mountain in the south the territory covers an area of about 5250 km2 and the sava river catchment size is 9057 km2 the major groundwater reserves are accumulated in thick quaternary sediments where high yield intergranular aquifers are formed the aquifer is recharged from precipitation and groundwater inflow however the main inflows to this aquifer are from surface waters the analysis of the groundwater regime indicates that the influence of the river on the groundwater table weakens with distance from sava river to simulate groundwater recharge and prediction of future groundwater levels aquimod and metran models were applied aquimod represents the groundwater system as a closed homogeneous medium with no impact from any outer boundary or feature whether physical or hydrological with the significant influence of river stages on groundwater heads it was therefore not possible to obtain a good aquimod model fig 4c metran on the other hand succeeded in capturing the groundwater dynamics fig 4c but only when the river water levels were added as an additional input signal 3 2 3 west ireland time series 15 16 17 18 20 31 33 34 aquifer complexity the boreholes are placed in the southeast part of ireland and where the river basins of the suir nore barrow and slaney rivers as well as a number of smaller coastal river catchments are located the main aquifers of interest are diffusely karstified limestone aquifers and extensive glacio fluvial sand and gravel aquifers groundwater from these regionally important aquifers provides up to 90 of the public water supply in some counties is important for agricultural and industrial uses and supports many small private supplies groundwater surface water interaction is significant and baseflows are high where rivers cross the principal aquifers the karst aquifers occupy the valleys and lowlands and are generally unconfined permeability varies with depth due to fracturing and karstification sands and gravels occur mainly along the major rivers but also form extensive domes groundwater is generally unconfined and flow pathways are simple the remainder of the area is underlain by poorly productive fissured bedrock aquifers the karstic and fissured bedrock aquifers have low effective porosity and very limited storage which renders them vulnerable to altered winter recharge patterns and extended dry periods effective rainfall is lowest in southeast ireland and there are currently concerns about water resources availability and demand and it is anticipated that this area will become progressively water stressed under future climate change scenarios aquimod and metran were applied to all eight groundwater level monitoring records fig 3 while six were simulated by gardénia detailed examples are shown on fig 4e figure f and fig s2b c s3b c esm the 30 year average 1981 2010 groundwater recharge for catchments to the eight boreholes were also estimated using the updated irish national recharge map hunter williams et al 2021 nses for aquimod historical simulations range from 0 36 to 0 86 and 0 24 0 8 for gardénia a lower limit of 0 5 was chosen for acceptance six of eight aquimod simulations and four of six gardénia exceed that lower limit four of eight metran models have the highest acceptance one was acceptable and three were insufficient metran recharge estimates are consistently higher than aquimod gardénia and the national model aquimod estimates tend to be lower or the same as the national model with no systematic pattern for gardénia results the reasons for differences or difficulties in calibrating are likely to be multiple and different depending on the site metran seems to be most applicable to gravel aquifers and more straightforward karst groundwater systems at two sites riverine influence on groundwater level is suspected metran does not calibrate without the river stage as explanatory variable using gardénia requires river flow data for the most robust simulations due to the lateral heterogeneity within irish catchments it is possible that the groundwater level variations are not representative of the nearest gauging stations which encompass a much larger catchment gardénia also requires a full calendar year of data and does not allow missing head data while the other models do overall aquimod seems to be most suited to simulation of groundwater levels in the irish aquifers included however it should be noted that the more complicated karst and fractured bedrock aquifers required two layer models at least to better represent the groundwater flow systems and more remains to be done in this regard clearly a good historical model fit will not guarantee predictive power in future climate change scenarios since different recharge dynamics timings and groundwater stages are likely to interact non linearly with the heterogeneous aquifers 3 2 4 north böda kinda sweden time series 1 2 snow cover projections in rural areas of sweden the supply of drinking water typically relies on private wells drilled in crystalline bedrock which drain the storage of the overlying soil layers typically up to a few meters of till in many areas groundwater storage is limited by low effective porosity and compartmentalised fragmented soil coverage this limited storage implies that the drinking water consumption must be in close balance with the recharge not only in terms of the long term means but more importantly with seasonal drought patterns otherwise the groundwater aquifers are in risk of depletions seasonal droughts are periods when the recharge is negligible such that any water consumption relies on drainage of groundwater storage the groundwater storage determines therefore the upper bound for consumption during the drought period and the vulnerability to the length of the drought period in turn this implies that the main concern of the ongoing climate changes is the signs of longer seasonal droughts at present the consumption from private wells is adapted to two types of seasonal droughts 1 winter drought when precipitation is stored as snow dominates in the north and 2 summer drought when interception and evapotranspiration exceed precipitation dominates in the south in areas of substantial snow storage compared to soil storage the snowmelt has the important role of re filling the storages prior to the onset of the summer drought climate change is expected to shift the balance of seasonal patterns from winter drought towards longer summer drought moreover the role of snowmelt for re filling the soil storage will weaken particularly in the south of sweden as the snow storage will diminish more precipitation will fall as rain during winter and the snowmelt will advance to an earlier date thereby elongating the summer drought on the brighter side climate change may shorten the winter drought in northern sweden simulations for the swedish pilots demonstrate the need to account for a retreating snow cover in climate change projections on future recharge and water supply three tools were tested and compared aquimod which does not account for snow storage and gardénia and hype which does account for snow storage all tools could be reasonably well calibrated for the present day situation figs 4g and 5g fig s2a and s3a of the esm the fit for aquimod was nse 0 59 and 0 61 for two pilots whereas it was nse 0 73 0 64 and nse 0 81 0 67 for gardénia and hype respectively obviously this signifies that data calibration is not undisputed evidence of model validity as the conceptual model also needs to capture the key processes involved a classical dilemma of models is that of equifinality beven 1993 where the model produces the right output but for the wrong reasons thus if the models are to be used for the projection of future conditions it is vital that the models are able to correctly represent the processes that are expected to change in the future e g in this case that the projection model includes a snow storage module 3 3 recharge estimations the recharge estimation for all the sites is shown in fig 6 by each of the models metran a aquimod b and gardénia c again as not all study sites have applied all three models some areas are left blank on the graphs recharge results for models with inferior performance are not shown this means that metran results are only shown for a performance of 1 or 2 negative recharge estimations which may be due to local discharge are left out of the plot but are found by metran for the boreholes nl 14 and nl 45 time series 26 30 49 51 one well is in an area that can be connected with an area with artificially managed water levels so here there may be upwelling discharge however this is not the case for the other well there is therefore no physical explanation to this value and the estimate is therefore discarded as mentioned earlier a poor score by metran may indicate that the input time series does not hold enough information to describe the groundwater level fluctuations in the observed time series thus in these cases it is potentially not possible to estimate recharge using the groundwater level data with the available climate and abstraction data and therefore any modelling efforts by aquimod and gardénia could be disregarded however in this case we have chosen to only disregard model results due to the model s own performance therefore gardénia results are shown for simulations with nse 0 7 for both groundwater levels and discharge and aquimod results are shown for all models except for sites where the model performance was deemed unacceptable as mentioned in the section above 4 6 9 20 and 76 as the models are sorted by metran performance the same sorting as fig 5 the aquimod and gardénia models with failed metran score 0 are easily identified as the models with missing columns to the right on fig 6 fig 6d and e show a comparison between the results from the three models the time series may both be from unconfined and confined aquifers and thus for aquimod the recharge estimation is sometimes not recharge fig 6d but inter aquifer leakage fig 6e looking across the results where all three models are used and performance was accepted 22 time series there are very little general agreements between the three models in relation to recharge estimates for some timeseries recharge estimations differ in the order of 700 mm y while much better agreement is reached in others often metran recharge values are higher than the other two tools but not always for the unconfined aquifers 11 time series metran estimates recharge with a mean of 530 mm y for the same boreholes aquimod estimates a mean of 220 mm y while gardénia estimates a mean of 290 mm y thus the uncertainty of recharge estimations is generally high and while multiple methods for assessing recharge exist as these three tools applied here their assumptions and results often deviate substantially as also found by e g dos santos et al 2021 and walker et al 2018 this is supported by a study by walker et al 2018 applying nine different recharge methods on a catchment in ethiopia they found that the range of recharge estimations could be reduced substantially when correctly identifying the recharge type minimum potential actual the appropriate scale of the estimation and accounting for the uncertainty of the method 3 4 comparing recharge estimations to local and national tools the true values of recharge for the sites are unknown therefore in order to try to identify reliable recharge estimates the recharge estimated by the three tools is compared with local and national model results whenever possible fig 6d and e for 32 time series there are recharge estimations from other tools a table of the annual recharge estimates for the 32 sites are available in the esm table s2 a comparison between the three models and the already established local and national results can also be seen in fig 7a from the scatter plot in fig 7a there is an inclination for metran recharge to be higher than the local and national tool estimates above the 1 1 line for aquimod and gardénia points are on both sides of the 1 1 line thus for most of these sites aquimod and gardénia estimates were fairly close to the local and national model results with a mean absolute deviation of 38 and 46 respectively for the gardénia run where discharge is used in the objective function deviation is 29 metran recharge estimations generally were higher with mean absolute deviation of 90 taking out all runs but aquimod and gardénia where metran failed gave similar deviations of 41 and 48 respectively and for gardénia with discharge 27 thus the bias of metran is quite higher than for the other models an investigation of the correlation of the estimates show that the models have similar correlation metran has a correlation pearson of 0 60 to recharge estimates by other tools while aquimod and gardénia correlation are 0 55 and 0 6 respectively to investigate this high bias further recharge values estimated using a larger number of time series in the netherlands by metran are compared to the outputs from the integrated dutch national hydrological model http nhi nu de lange et al 2014 the comparison shows that metran estimates do not compare well with the results from the integrated model fig 8 and there is no visible pattern in the locations with reasonable performance green underestimation yellow or overestimation blue fig 8b metran only uses precipitation and evapotranspiration however its application does not give a reliable estimate of recharge values either net precipitation or net precipitation minus runoff and local drainage this suggests that special conditions or additional information are required to obtain reliable recharge estimates from groundwater head time series in combination with precipitation and evapotranspiration obergfell et al 2019 applied a similar method with the additional constraint that the seasonal harmonic of the observed head matches the sum of the transformed seasonal harmonics of the input variables in the time series model for a specific area to obtain results that compared well with independent estimates however the validity and consequences of this constraint are unknown this study does thus point to aquimod and gardénia being appropriate methods for estimation of recharge when considering the uncertainties inevitably attached to the estimation of groundwater recharge from hydraulic head measurements however it is only possible to validate with other local and national modelling results also prone to uncertainties making this deduction only indicative furthermore this study focuses on diffuse recharge while indirect recharge from streams lakes and rivers are not considered however indirect recharge type are dominant in arid or semidry semi arid areas and if omitted the recharge to the entire aquifer may thus be underestimated for these climatologies 3 5 comparing recharge estimations to pan european estimate fig 6d also includes potential recharge values obtained from the pan eu recharge map martinsen et al 2022 two limitations should be noted in this comparison first the pan eu recharge map is created using the national hydrological model s infiltration coefficient combined with other spatial variables in the machine learning algorithm these are the same national models applied in spain france ireland denmark and the netherlands for which a subset of estimated recharge values was used for comparison to the recharge estimate in the previous section thus these two datasets for comparisons are not entirely independent secondly the values from the recharge map are of potential recharge i e infiltration recharge leaving the soil zone they are not therefore directly comparable to the previous recharge and inter aquifer leakage estimations however this means that pan eu recharge estimation should be equal to or larger than the other estimations as interflow drainage and runoff to surface water have not been removed furthermore the map is generated at eu scale and must therefore be assumed to be less accurate than local models and models like gardénia where the calibration data are used to complete the hydrological balance nonetheless some tendencies in the recharge distribution at some of the sites are replicated e g lower potential recharge in sweden and ireland than in denmark high variability in potential recharge estimates in the uk and lower potential recharge values in france and spain from the scatter plot of the three models and the pan eu recharge map in fig 7b it can be clearly observed that there is a tendency for metran recharge to be above the 1 1 line meaning the recharge values are generally overestimated in relation to the pan eu map for aquimod and gardénia the points are more scattered but with most points being below the 1 1 line as expected noting that the type of recharge calculated by these models is either recharge or inter aquifer leakage rather than the potential recharge provided by the pan eu map the statistics for mean absolute deviation and correlation given in parenthesis are here for aquimod and gardénia deviation of 50 0 41 and 51 0 76 respectively with gardénia with discharge 22 0 68 and metran 112 0 72 4 discussion 4 1 applicability and limitations of the time series models recharge estimation based on groundwater head time series are valuable tools as they require very little data and can be easily and widely applied time series models are a subset of these tools and they however cover a range of different approaches and their applicability limitations and precision are not always well known for some recharge estimation is a by product of the tool and the credibility of this recharge estimation is often uncertainty time series models like metran use precipitation and evapotranspiration combined with abstraction as input for calculating recharge for metran it was shown that there are several problems in using this tool to assess recharge the simulated groundwater head levels may be reasonable or good and close to the measurements for a site the average long term recharge from metran was shown to have a high bias but to correlate fairly well with local and national recharge estimates for the study sites used in this study but on further investigation concerningly low correlation and lack of systematics in the estimations was found when comparing to results from the distributed national model in the netherlands that implies that a reliable estimation of recharge is not possible using metran and this possibly also applies to similar transfer noise models these shortcomings will increase the uncertainty even further if the model is used to predict climate change impact in contrast metran was shown to effectively model groundwater head levels and is therefore a powerful and fast tool for assessing groundwater level the metran model was also successfully used to identify periods of time within a time series where the noise ratio was low thereby assisting in the setup of other recharge estimation models as in boreholes in italy the flexible setup of the model also made it possible to adjust the model to sites where special conditions were governing the hydrology e g at the serbian site near the sava river a more physical description of the recharge process combined with a subsurface representation as in aquimod can help to improve the recharge estimates collenteur et al 2021 peterson and fulton 2019 depending on the available information the choice of representation of the saturated zone may be arbitrary and parameter values may be hard to check for the aquimod model it was found that for several time series it was difficult or not possible to obtain a calibrated model where the other models succeeded in some cases this was related to special conditions at the site that could not be simulated by the model e g river influence in serbia in other cases the model seems to be very sensitive to gaps in the dataset and the quality of the input calibration data this meant in some cases that obtaining a calibrated model was only possible when using part of the dataset e g in italy obviously the lack of a snow module means that the model is less appropriate to apply in snow dominated areas especially for projections into future climate it is the only model of the suite tested that allows the modeller to directly incorporate hydro geological understanding of the area and to investigate inter aquifer leakage to deeper aquifers the model was also found to have good predictive capability regarding groundwater levels as shown in the case of spain the deviations and correlations to local and national models were acceptable for aquimod however despite the inclusion of a physical description of the subsurface aquimod did not always assure the simulation of meaningful recharge estimates in spite of good calibration performance for groundwater levels this is due to the non uniqueness of the problem where equally good groundwater level performance can be obtained by scaling the recharge estimate and or aquifer storage as the water balance is not contained in the modelling framework this issue may to some degree be addressed by investigating all successful aquimod runs during a calibration providing a variation in the recharge estimate that may be further constrained by prior or expert knowledge on recharge magnitudes other tools simple groundwater flow darcy evaluation field measurements it is therefore found that it is preferable to have an additional tool for comparison when applying aquimod for recharge estimation when these limitations are kept in mind aquimod may be used as an informative tool for recharge estimation where percentiles 25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile of the estimated recharge values can be calculated based on the accepted model runs the non uniqueness can only be eliminated if the water balance is directly accounted for in the model this is possible in gardénia that can use surface water discharge observations to constrain the recharge depending on knowledge of the surface area of the catchment and the other terms of the water balance determining the true magnitude of the water balance terms for a lumped catchment may be challenging this is especially the case in lowland areas where groundwater and surface water catchment areas may not coincide also in wetlands where there may be multiple surface water connections with varying flow directions for well defined groundwater systems boundary fluxes have little influence if the area is large enough but the relative importance of groundwater abstractions depends on the local situation for karstic system gardénia offers different options depending on the behaviour of the basin there is the possibility of adjusting the area of the watershed or introducing external flows inside the hydrological system or even introducing an external exchange factor for this a robust conceptual model is needed the size of the contribution area of groundwater recharge is generally a very sensitive parameter in gardénia calculations for the different modelled sites in this study only one rain gauged station was used but gardénia does offer the possibility of adjusting the climatic input parameters rain and pet to correct the deviation especially for large surface basins generally the gardénia had relatively low bias and fairly good correlation to the national and local models however like for aquimod application of gardénia is problematic without river discharge information to guide the storage term this was observed at various sites where low recharge to large surface runoff estimates was compensated by a change in the storage coefficient the joint use of groundwater level and discharge data allows a more robust model less subject to the problem of equifinality and investigating the performance of the simulations where discharge was included in the objective function compared to the national and local model showed a similar correlation as for all simulations but a clear improvement in bias thus gardénia is a robust and easy to use model especially with a good knowledge of the hydrological system and reliable data and calibration is quite straightforward with gardénia because of the automatic calibration the study showed very varying estimates of recharge at the different sites and as the true value is unknown it is not possible to firmly identify the model giving the correct recharge nevertheless gardénia was closest to the available national local estimates for the sites especially when discharge was included in the calibration thus the dataset is too limited to draw any firm conclusions and the study should be regarded as the initial steps in identifying the usefulness and precision of these tools for different settings additionally it is found that using long time series 20 years is preferable to improve the confidence in the model results generally results points to that the time series models are especially useful for locations were other factors like abstraction or surface waters influence the water table observations but that very complex and heterogeneous study sites such as karstic areas are problematic difficult to simulate with all models and here more detailed integrated modelling is needed 4 2 can adequate prediction of groundwater level guarantee correct recharge estimation the study shows very varying estimates of recharge at the different sites for models that all have very good performance during calibration thus it is possible to reproduce the observed behaviour of groundwater levels but to perform poorly in the calculation of recharge this may be due to failure of the predictive power or non uniqueness of the model as mentioned above or due to application in hydrological or geological settings that they cannot appropriately represent limitations in model structure the model structure deficiency may get compensated by hydraulic parameter values that are not representative of the hydrogeological system characteristics consequently the user knowledge of the complexity of the hydrogeological system can therefore limit the robustness of the model output and errors are easily made and difficult to identify if only one model is applied therefore applying more than one model on a case is recommend as also mentioned by e g de vries and simmers 2002 this study was limited to three conceptually very different groundwater level models used to estimate groundwater recharge however while several similar and different approaches exist results from this study may not always be directly transferable although the study covers a large and diverse selection of cases in europe it was not possible to cover all climate types and geological settings a valuable next step in this process would therefore be to expand this study by including a large set of tools and sites and thereby developing a formulation of a rigorous scheme for the selection of appropriate recharge estimation tools based on overall study site data characteristics this would be especially useful if the different models and approaches can be integrated and benchmarked against each other and additional independent methods to reduce the overall uncertainty in recharge estimation procedures as demonstrated by crosbie and rachakonda 2021 where recharge from chloride mass balance estimates were constrained using remote sensing the calibration performance of the aquimod and gardénia models and whether the models are deemed acceptable adequate or not are in this case based on expert judgement and best practice even though the applied methodology relies on an automated approach to optimise the solution for example the election of a stricter or relaxed performing measure threshold may lead to different model results being used the evaluation of the model is therefore also a contributor to the uncertainty of the results it is possible that if water balance could somehow be constrained in the aquimod model more runs would succeed as the optimization results could be a different parameter solution in this study the reason for a failure of any of the models to provide reasonable results is sought in specific conditions quality setting of the data and study site however as is true for all modelling work uncertainties are also depended on the choices approach and experience of the modeller thus combining the scheme for the selection of appropriate tools with a more elaborate framework for evaluating whether or not when a model s performance is acceptable or not is a necessary next step when moving forward 4 3 recharge taxonomy in this study we have tried to divide recharge into different recharge types in order to compare the same type of recharge with each other the taxonomy adopted here is coarse and may not always be applicable as mentioned in section 4 1 due to small scale processes it may not always be possible to make a clear distinction between potential recharge and recharge also in multiple aquifer systems recharge and inter aquifer recharge may occur at multiple depths and the depth of the aquifer is in that case important 4 4 limitations in the comparison to other methods a major limitation in the study is the fact that no true values for recharge are known at any of the sites recharge estimations from the three models can therefore only be compared to other modelling numerical or machine learning results which may not represent the correct recharge at the site and are therefore uncertain additional conditioning of the modelling results could be undertaken by obtaining recharge from independent estimations by in situ measurements like chloride mass balance based on deposition from the atmosphere custodio 2010 where a long term recharge can be established or age tracers these measurements were unfortunately not available at the study sites but could potentially be used for evaluating model performance when compared to model estimates other methods like lysimeters also allow direct measurement of recharge however depending on the location of the lysimeter and the variability of the landscape around it the transferability of the measured values to regional water balance or groundwater model will vary because of the typical variability of soil cover and land use fitts 2013 witte et al 2019 the representativity of the measured recharge also varies because of the impact of some land uses and the associated soil treatments on lysimeter functioning voortman et al 2015 furthermore modelling results from local or national models are not available at all sites studies like the investigation done in the netherlands for the metran model utilizing a very high number of sites could be a potential way to improve and test the reliability of the models even though such a study will be extremely time consuming for models like gardénia and aquimod where knowledge of the geology and hydrology are essential to build into the setup 5 conclusions this study compared and analysed results and limitations of three conceptually different groundwater time series models for recharge estimation metran aquimod and gardénia explored across different climatic hydrological and geological settings to facilitate this comparison a recharge taxonomy was developed where recharge is defined in three types 1 potential recharge 2 recharge reaching the phreatic aquifer 3 inter aquifer leakage in lack of true measurements of recharge the groundwater level recharge models are compared to estimation by local and national models for the different sites here it was shown that aquimod and gardénia show deviations of 38 and 46 while metran was somewhat higher 90 the correlation coefficient were similar for the three models but highest for gardénia and here the bias greatly improved when incorporating discharge in the simulation the transfer noise model metran based on groundwater head measurements driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration was shown to be a powerful model for assessing groundwater levels data noise and for incorporating site specific conditions but due to the high bias in combination with a poor correlation seen for a larger sample of dutch boreholes it was found that such transfer function noise models are potentially inaccurate recharge estimation tools and should be used with care the groundwater level driven hydrological model aquimod and the lumped catchment models gardénia both based on climate input and calibration of governing parameters to hydraulic head measurements were generally shown to be successful at simulating groundwater levels however it was shown that special care must be taken when estimating recharge with a model setup without water balance constraints discharge data as in aquimod the non uniqueness means that the best procedure when using these types of models would be to use an ensemble of successful model runs and thereby include an estimation of uncertainty of the recharge estimate and or confine results with alternative information on recharge magnitudes it was found that when water balance is accounted groundwater levels time series models can be very relevant tools for relatively simple study sites where boundary conditions abstraction river affect head fluctuations but for complex and heterogeneous sites more detailed integrated modelling is needed furthermore in light of the uncertainties of the methods applying multiple methods on a site is recommended overall as there is generally a lack of on site recharge measurements for validation of these tools a multiple tools approach is recommended to capture uncertainty ranges when estimating recharge from groundwater heads the large uncertainty of the recharge estimated by any of the tools must thus be considered when applying any of these models for recharge estimation or future prediction funding

7673,study region the study uses 78 groundwater head time series across 10 european countries with various geological and hydrological settings study focus the estimation of groundwater recharge using time series analysis and lumped modelling based on groundwater head time series is a low cost and practical method however lumped recharge estimation models based on groundwater level variations are uncertain and successful applications are known to depend on both climate and hydrogeological setting here we assess the suitability of three different models to estimate recharge metran transfer function noise model aquimod groundwater level driven hydrological model and gardénia lumped catchment model new hydrological insights results showed that while all three models generally did well during the modelling of groundwater heads the resulting recharge estimations from the models were different the analysis showed that the transfer noise modelling of groundwater heads with recharge and evapotranspiration in metran is not generally applicable for recharge estimation the addition of physical information in aquimod improved the recharge estimations but the reliability was still limited without control of the water balance due to non uniqueness by adding discharge information to the modelling gardénia can provide more reliable recharge values thus recharge estimation from groundwater head time series without water balance information must be considered uncertain with low precision but applicability can be improved when including knowledge of the local system keywords groundwater recharge lumped modelling time series analysis europe data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction knowledge about groundwater recharge and potential changes in a future climate is important for water resource management and the assessment of a sustainable use of groundwater e g alley et al 2002 margat and van der gun 2013 pulido velazquez et al 2020 this includes

without causing ecological damage steffen et al 2015 gleeson et al 2020 measuring and estimating groundwater recharge is not straightforward alley et al 2002 a large variety of methods exists for recharge assessment custodio 2019 e g in situ lysimeters water budget calculations including streamflow separation techniques analysis of groundwater head time series such as water table fluctuation methods lumped models or transfer noise modelling unsaturated zone modelling and integrated hydrological modelling scanlon et al 2002 healy 2010 sibanda et al 2009 because groundwater head time series are widely available analysis of groundwater head time series for recharge estimation has been applied extensively in the literature e g healy and cooke 2002 the methods often required very little data and can thus be setup in countries and locations where data coverages are lacking or insufficient for more data intense methods e g integrated modelling approaches while being very fast to create and deploy a fairly simple method is the water table fluctuation method e g crosbie et al 2005 which requires information on the specific yield which may not be known accurately other methods using groundwater heads can take into account boundary conditions and other processes e g abstraction that may affect the groundwater levels e g peterson and fulton 2019 uncertainties in recharge estimations based on heads are however often substantial delin et al 2007 nimmo et al 2015 if head are influenced by other factors while recharge is highly dependent on climate it is also dependent on surface and sub surface conditions thus the recharge estimate will depend not only on the input data but also on the recharge conditions and mechanisms and whether the selected model can represent these mechanisms satisfactorily lafare et al 2021 de vries and simmers 2002 recommend that water resources practitioners identify important features that influence recharge for a given location first and then apply a recharge calculation model that is suitable to actual field conditions it is possible that some model types may not be applicable under certain conditions or settings and therefore both governing features for recharge creation and appropriate model type may be difficult to immediately identify therefore de vries and simmers 2002 recommend applying and comparing multiple independent approaches to the same case study the focus of this paper is to investigate the potential use of recharge estimates from three structurally different groundwater head driven models across different climatic hydrological and geological settings in europe two of these models have been chosen as they have been used for seasonal groundwater head forecasts e g prudhomme et al 2017 and can be potentially used therefore to undertake recharge forecasts these models are the groundwater level driven hydrological model aquimod mackay et al 2014a and the lumped catchment model gardénia thiéry 2015a in order to apply a third different model type it was chosen to test the recharge produced by a transfer noise model metran zaadnoordijk et al 2019 because this type of model is widely applied and it has been suggested that it can provide useful recharge estimates collenteur et al 2021 obergfell et al 2019 the objective of this paper is to investigate if the successful model calibration and simulation of observed groundwater head fluctuations are sufficient indication of reasonable groundwater recharge estimates and to explore possible limitations of their use we focus on diffuse recharge from precipitation and present a taxonomy based on literature nomenclature to classify the calculated values to enable a proper comparison due to lack of in situ measurements of recharge at the sites to verify or reject the recharge estimations the head driven model estimates are compared to recharge generated by other methods e g local and national hydrological or integrated models and a machine learning based european recharge map martinsen et al 2022 the head driven models employ contrasting approaches to assess recharge using groundwater heads precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as input and optionally surface water discharge and groundwater abstractions the concept of recharge considered by the various tools and approaches is not always the same making a comparison of results problematic flint et al 2002 barthel et al 2021 therefore this study also presents a taxonomy based on literature nomenclature for classifying the recharge estimates and identifies the different recharge types estimated by the applied tools it should be noted that the models estimate diffuse recharge occurring from infiltrating excess precipitation through the soil and unsaturated zone thus this recharge type is the focus here and return irrigation and repellency of soils on flat surfaces are not considered the paper is structured as follows first is the method

the next section describes the calibration of and the experiences from four selected case studies 3 1 followed by the overall results of all the case studies investigated in the paper 3 2 and 3 3 the final sections of the paper include the discussion 4 and conclusions 5 the discussion and conclusions will be focused on first a comparison of the model s recharge estimations and performance and secondly identifying limitations and recommendations for models and approaches this work has been conducted by a group of european geological surveys during the geoera tactic project tactic 2021b 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study sites are distributed across europe fig 1 where time series of groundwater heads in 56 monitoring wells are included nine of these are multi screen wells and have groundwater head time series from multiple depths yielding a total of 78 time series for the analysis the sites have very different characteristics in terms of climate geology and hydrology an overview of the overall characteristics can be seen in table s1 in the electronic supplementary material esm the groundwater head time series have been chosen based on the availability of adequate data in terms of resolution length data gaps as well as representativity of the regional aquifer system instead of e g local pumping or surface water and availability of precipitation and evapotranspiration data no actual evapotranspiration was available and it was assumed that differences in determination of evapotranspiration values are accounted for by the models in the translation to actual evapotranspiration and do not influence the estimated recharge the study sites span a range of climatological settings each site has been assigned to a climatic zone and together they cover five out of the six climatic zones proposed by schneider et al 2013 the mediterranean group climatic zone m table s1 is characterized by high summer temperatures and mild winters often precipitation is predominantly during winter the four study sites in this group have a very high potential evapotranspiration 1000 mm y with examples of both high italy and low precipitation areas spain the next group is the temperate oceanic climatic zone to here the proximity to the coast means the precipitation is high for most of the year with mild winters and warm summers this group consists of the largest set of sites 47 in total the sites generally have precipitation between 800 and 900 mm y and experience potential evapotranspiration in the order of 600 mm y the temperate zone situated away from the oceans is the temperate continental zone climatic zone tc which generally has a larger contrast between winter and summer temperatures and precipitation occurring mainly during wintertime the four study sites located here have lower precipitation than in the oceanic area with precipitation around 600 700 mm y with one outlier of 850 mm y drava mura this group generally experiences potential evapotranspiration in the order of 700 mm y with over 900 mm y for serbia one study site lies in between these two temperate zones in the temperate transitional zone climatic zone tt and this zone is a mix of the preceding two zones i e with high seasonal contrast but precipitation occurring during all seasons geologically the aquifers at the sites are also very diverse table s1 most of the aquifers in this study are sedimentary aquifers comprising of porous media like silt sand and gravel or fissured sedimentary aquifers this accounts for 25 of the 56 sites four sites are alluvial aquifers with sand or gravel media and eight represent karstic environments with limestone observations from both unconfined and confined groundwater settings are present among the 78 groundwater head time series with a prevalence of unconfined times series 48 out of 78 the hydrology of the sites is generally not very affected by surface runoff tile drainage or rivers 20 of the sites are affected by one or more of the three for the sites where stream discharge data are available it was included in the modelling for ten site and not used for two sites where the applied tool does not use discharge or it is not relevant to include groundwater abstractions are present at only 6 sites and are always included in the modelling 2 2 definition of recharge types in a broad sense groundwater recharge is water that is added to the saturated zone meinzer 1923 more specifically recharge can be defined as the downward flow of water reaching the water table adding to groundwater storage as suggested by e g healy 2010a 2010b more loosely recharge is also sometimes defined as the downward flux of water towards the water table e g healy 2010a 2010b and fitts 2013 it is often divided into diffuse recharge from precipitation or irrigation and localized recharge from surface waters and wadis scanlon et al 2002 we focus on diffuse recharge from precipitation throughout the vertical migration of water in the soil column multiple subsurface processes influence the downward flux of water e g by storage change or evapotranspiration and change the amount of water accessible for further infiltration thus the recharge will differ depending on where in the subsurface the infiltrating water is considered as recharge and this taxonomy may therefore be unclear or imprecise staudinger et al 2019 none of these definitions include flow between groundwater systems where one aquifer may provide recharge to another to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of the recharge results from the tools used in this study and other sources this paper distinguishes three types of recharge based on the specific location in the hydrogeological system and linked to the water flow process involved before or at that location potential recharge recharge based on the definition by healy 2010a 2010b and inter aquifer leakage the three types are illustrated in fig 2 with the associated fluxes in the subsurface the vertical green arrows are the different recharge types decreasing if storage increases and water moves away with lateral flow the red box symbolizes losses near the surface due to processes such as surface runoff evapotranspiration including root uptake interception and soil evaporation affecting the soil moisture deficit together with precipitation these losses determine the potential recharge leaving the root zone potential recharge is equal to the water surplus arising from precipitation and irrigation after actual evapotranspiration and reducing the soil moisture deficit and surface runoff to surface water systems potential recharge has many terms in the literature and is also called percolation net infiltration or drainage see e g hendrickx and walker 1997 some of this potential recharge will be captured by the unsaturated zone storage restricting soil layers and interflow the remainder of the potential recharge reaches the groundwater table and becomes part of the saturated zone this recharge type is simply referred to as recharge the recharge is thus the gross amount of water that recharges the upper phreatic aquifer through the water table in a groundwater aquifer system with one or more confining layers there may be recharge to confined aquifer due to downward flow through an overlying confining aquitard this recharge type is termed inter aquifer leakage and will have a different hydraulic head response than the recharge type defined above this type covers all aquifers in the system that are underneath an aquitard and are not phreatic in a multi aquifer system there may be multiple recharge locations in case of perched conditions and multiple inter aquifer leakages in the case of multiple confined aquifers in that case it is necessary to specify the depth the recharge is associated with depending on the spatial resolution the schematisation of fig 2 does not capture all small scale processes especially small surface water bodies e g streams or gullies or tile drainage in that case infiltrating water may be drained to surface water depending on the method of evaluation it may then be impossible to separate the related fluxes from the surface runoff for potential recharge or the interflow for recharge 2 3 recharge estimation models three models are applied in this study to estimate the recharges metran aquimod and gardénia in table 1 a general overview is shown for the three models these time series or zero dimensional models are also introduced in subsections 2 3 1 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 respectively table 2 provides a summary of the conceptual representation of processes included in these models together with the number of parameters to be identified during calibration recharge estimates from these models are compared to results of measurements or models already present at the sites therefore a brief overview of the methods is included in section 2 3 4 2 3 1 transfer noise metran metran is a software program for modelling groundwater head time series using a transfer function noise approach with precipitation and reference evapotranspiration data zaadnoordijk et al 2019 the precipitation transfer function is a three parameter function based on the gamma distribution which is a unimodal function with a wide range of possible shapes see the parameters in table 2 the transfer function for the reference evapotranspiration is the same except for a multiplication factor referred to as the evapotranspiration factor fe the noise model is an autoregressive model with a single parameter the five resulting parameters of the applied metran models total size of precipitation response two shape parameters of the precipitation response evapotranspiration factor and decay parameter of the noise model have no direct physical meaning that can be used to evaluate the calibration metran runs on a webserver to provide models explaining the variation of groundwater heads in the dutch national database http www grondwaterstandeninbeeld nl it can also be used offline and with different explanatory variables and time series in various formats obergfell et al 2019 proposed a recharge r estimate based on such a time series model which is equal to the rainfall n minus the reference evapotranspiration e multiplied by the evapotranspiration factor fe 1 r n fe e this was found to give a reasonable estimate of the long term average recharge in an area with a phreatic aquifer without surface runoff and interflow obergfell et al 2019 in that case the potential recharge recharge and inter aquifer leakage recharge all have the same value the evapotranspiration factor fe was smaller than one indicating that the actual evapotranspiration was smaller than the reference evapotranspiration usually it is safe to assume that the actual evapotranspiration is not greater than the reference evapotranspiration this leads to the interpretation that a value of the evapotranspiration factor greater than one indicates loss of water e g due to drainage surface runoff or interflow to surface waters in this situation the factor fe is interpreted as the reduction of the precipitation contribution to recharge while the actual evapotranspiration is assumed to be equal to the reference evapotranspiration the latter assumption seems reasonable if the groundwater table is so close to the surface that drainage and surface runoff are important this gives the following approximation for recharge 2 r n fe e fe 1 3 r n fe e fe 1 2 3 2 groundwater level based hydrological model aquimod aquimod is a lumped numerical model that was originally developed to investigate the behaviour of a groundwater system the aim is to predict missing historical groundwater levels and calculate future groundwater levels mackay et al 2014a the model captures the conceptual understanding of a groundwater system using three numerical modules these represent the soil zone the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone water infiltration into the soil zone is calculated using the fao drainage and irrigation paper 56 fao 1998 approach as modified by griffiths et al 2006 the first module accounts for actual evapotranspiration from crops and the soil moisture deficit to calculate excess water from rainfall the excess water is split into infiltration and runoff the delay of infiltrated water movement within the unsaturated zone is controlled by the second module using a two parameter weibull probability density function finally the fluctuation of groundwater levels is simulated by the third module representing the saturated zone using an explicit numerical form of the mass balance equation the saturated zone can be represented by several vertically arranged aquifers to capture the conceptual understanding of the site a full description of the mathematical equations used to simulate the movement of water in these three zones is detailed by mackay et al 2014a and mackay et al 2014b this study focuses on the amount of water infiltration into the aquifer consequently the recharge estimated from aquimod is considered recharge or inter aquifer leakage the model is calibrated by changing the hydraulic parameter values included in the three modules an overview of the parameters can be seen in table 2 in aquimod all the hydraulic parameters have a physical meaning such as the root constant soil moisture at wilting point and at saturation hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient values of each compartment representing the saturated part of the aquifer only the flow with the unsaturated part of the aquifer is simulated using a mathematical equation which replicates the impact of the unsaturated zone on the groundwater flow the calibration is done using a monte carlo approach that produces several simulations that are equally acceptable these acceptable simulations are all used to calculate uncertainty bounds around the estimated recharge values 2 3 3 lumped catchment model gardénia the computer code gardénia modèle global a réservoirs pour la simulation des débits et des niveaux aquifères is a lumped hydrological model for the simulation of relationships between time series of stream or spring flow data at the outlet of a watershed and or groundwater level data at an observation well situated in the underlying aquifer unconfined aquifer and the rainfall received over the corresponding catchment groundwater abstractions can be considered if necessary the behaviour of an aquifer system is represented by a series of interconnected tanks non linear transfer functions improve the capability of this representation to simulate a complex system gardénia simulates the water cycle through a series of 3 or 4 connected tanks that represent respectively 1 the top few decimetres of soil that are subjected to the influence of evapotranspiration root zone 2 an intermediate zone of rapid flow or quick flow 3 one or two aquifer zones of delayed slow flow the outflow from one reservoir to another is controlled by simple laws specific to each reservoir these laws are governed by the model parameters active storage duration of outflow overflow threshold etc gardénia determines the hydrological balance for the basin actual evapotranspiration runoff infiltration and recharge the hydrological balance can be used for the evaluation of groundwater recharge to the groundwater table recharge gardénia also provides river flow groundwater level or recharge data over the period for which precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data are known one or two series of observations can be considered river flows at the basin outlet and or representative groundwater levels at an observation well located in the basin also taking impacts of groundwater or river abstraction into account calibration is done in a semi automatic way the user provides an initial set of parameters and indicates which parameters should be optimised see an overview of parameters in table 2 gardenia s hydraulic parameters have also a physical meaning similarly to aquimod but there are also linear equations that are used to control the movement of water in the subsurface and the parameters of which are optimised during calibration the model uses a non linear optimisation algorithm for calibration adopted from the rosenbrock method rosenbrock 1963 the model varies the chosen parameters within a range of values defined by the user and searches for the set which gives the best fit between observed and simulated values 2 3 4 performance evaluation as the three models are different so are the ways their performance is evaluated the performance of a metran model is expressed by three scores of 0 1 and 2 based on the model evaluation criteria given by zaadnoordijk et al 2019 a score of 0 indicates the model is not acceptable 1 that it is acceptable potentially useful and 2 that it fulfils additional criteria good the criteria are related to the explained variance independence of the noise part from the transfer part and the chance of overfitting the inability to fit an acceptable model can be due to any or all of the following conditions 1 a variable with an important influence on the groundwater heads was not included e g abstraction 2 non representative input data e g inadequate precipitation or evapotranspiration data 3 insufficient information in the calibration data or errors in groundwater heads 4 a linear response with the gamma response function cannot provide an adequate approximation of the groundwater system however to aid the comparison of the three models the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse see nash and sutcliffe 1970 of metran s groundwater level simulation have also been calculated the performance of aquimod is routinely evaluated using standard performance criteria such as the root square mean error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse see nash and sutcliffe 1970 performance measures while nse is used in gardénia to evaluate the performance of both groundwater heads and river discharge while many studies set criteria that relate the goodness of calibration to the nse values moriasi et al 2007 kalin et al 2010 kouchi et al 2017 there exist no standard values of nse used for the acceptance failing of aquimod simulations an nse value of 1 0 indicates a perfect match between the observed and simulated data in this study we consider aquimod simulations that achieve an nse score higher than 0 7 as good simulations that can capture the observed data behaviour those with nse score of 0 5 are still included as they simulated groundwater level time series show acceptable reflection of the observed ones for the gardénia model previous work bouanani et al 2012 jeannin et al 2021 and experience the performance of gardénia have showed that nse is deemed acceptable when it is above 0 7 good when above 0 8 and very good for nse values above 0 9 this criterion is also implemented here and gardénia simulations that produce nse values greater than 0 7 are accepted for analysis 2 3 5 other results used for comparison recharge results from models and measurements from other studies were also collected and used in this study for comparing and assessing recharge estimates the models are mostly from national modelling studies but some site specific model results are also available the model types are both hydrological and integrated hydrological models an overview of the additional results used is shown in table 3 the models will be described briefly in the following section but for more detailed information the reader is referred to the references given in table 3 in croatia recharge was estimated from lysimeter measurements patrčević 1995 and water balance analyses urumović et al 1981 brkić 1999 this recharge estimation has also been used as input in a modflow harbaugh et al 2000 model brkić et al 2021 modflow is a groundwater flow simulation program and needs groundwater recharge as input either as a calibration parameter or an input value time series instead of climate input e g precipitation pot evapotranspiration three additional hydrological models are used nam sacramento and hype the nam model nielsen and hansen 1973 is a lumped conceptual catchment model based on four water storage compartments where water is moved through the system using nine empirical parameters recharge is calculated as the water moving from the root zone storage to the groundwater storage and only represents recharge to the saturated zone type2 the model was set up and calibrated for three catchments containing the danish sites within the tactic project tactic 2021a hype is a semi distributed conceptual hydrological model which was developed in sweden and is now used as the national swedish hydrological model for discharge and nutrient loads s hype strömqvist et al 2012 the s hype model is used extensively in sweden and multiple uses have been well documented in this study the recharge in hype reflects percolation to the groundwater table type2 where the calculation of net precipitation employs a generalised empirical relationship for evapotranspiration that has been calibrated for the national model involving a water balance of c 400 catchments the sacramento model was used in spain where it provided the input of groundwater recharge type2 to the local modflow model setup for the upper guadiana basin collados lara et al 2021 surge 2018 the national recharge estimation tool the zooming object oriented distributed recharge model zoodrm is used in united kingdom mansour et al 2018 the model calculates recharge using characteristics of plant growth and water uptake as well as information on soil characteristics and climatic conditions the model operates on grid basis and covers the entire british mainland the hydrodynamic model of the chalk aquifer of the somme basin uses a finite difference groundwater modelling approach implemented in brgm s marthe code thiéry 2015b thiéry et al 2018 groundwater is the primary water resource for water supply in the french somme department hydrodynamic modelling of the somme basin amraoui et al 2004 is used to study the impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge to the chalky aquifer piezometric level fluctuations and streamflow to the drainage network amraoui 2019 like modflow marthe is a groundwater flow simulation program that needs groundwater recharge as input integrated hydrological models also form the basis of the national water resources model of denmark based on mike she and the netherlands based on modflow for groundwater de lange et al 2014 common to these models is the integrated calculation of unsaturated zone surface water and groundwater fluxes and they can therefore estimate all three recharge types water fluxes in the unsaturated zone are calculated based on e g richard s equation marthe or a 2 layer solver mike she the saturated zone fluxes are calculated by finite difference solving darcy equations for 3d groundwater flow the national application of the models is well documented in previous publications for the netherlands de lange et al 2014 and denmark højberg et al 2013 stisen et al 2019 also included is a local high resolution version of the dutch national model run for the catchment of deraam tactic 2021a the last tool used for comparison of recharge is a machine learning aided approach developed in the tactic project for the calculation of potential recharge type1 at a pan european scale martinsen et al 2022 the machine learning algorithm uses gridded national model estimates of infiltration coefficients as training data applying a range of explanatory variables to establish the governing variables for infiltration across europe the resulting infiltration coefficient map is then multiplied onto a european net precipitation map generated from the e obs precipitation dataset at 0 1 resolution and satellite data for evapotranspiration cornes et al 2018 in this study potential recharge is obtained for the grid location of the study sites more information on the method can be acquired from tactic 2021b 3 results 3 1 calibration results the performance of the models after calibration from the different study sites is presented in fig 3 as not all study sites have all three tools some areas are left blank on the graphs the metran model is applied for all 78 time series as seen in fig 3a 35 out of 78 time series have the best performing model fit score 2 while 31 are acceptable score 1 for a small group of 12 it was not possible to calibrate a usable metran model for the site score 0 for comparative reasons nse is shown by the bar height in the fig ure as can be seen a high nse is not always a guarantee for a good score and vice versa due to the two stage nature of the standard performance evaluation overall 31 of the metran models have nse values above 0 75 aquimod is applied to 40 time series in 37 study sites fig 3b most of the model runs 28 time series produce very high nse values 0 70 for the groundwater level while 7 sites produce nse values between 0 5 and 0 7 poorer performance was found for five sites in serbia denmark and ireland gardénia is used for 30 groundwater head time series fig 3c sixteen sites of these include stream discharge fig 3d generally performances are good with 19 time series for groundwater heads and ten time series for stream discharges having nse values larger than 0 70 and eight time series for groundwater heads and two time series for stream discharges with nse above 0 50 but below 0 70 performance deteriorates for four sites in ireland and in spain the calibration of the different models shows that there is not always a correspondence between when the models succeed or fail for time series where all three models are applied 22 time series 32 of the time series show that all succeed in making a reasonable calibration target for 10 time series one model fails to produce a reliable result while four time series only have one model succeeding out of three for the time series where two models are applied 29 time series both models are successful in 62 of the cases one of the two models fails in 11 of the cases there is thus seldom a correlation between the poor performance of the models there is also no clear tendency that it is always the same model that fails generally metran and aquimod have a fail rate of 15 and 10 respectively while gardénia fails in 37 of all applications 3 2 selected case studies to illustrate the modelling of recharge using the three models four case study sites are described in more details each case study illustrates and highlights different structural differences or limitations of one or all three models the case studies have been chosen both to illustrate important challenges with applying the models and to cover a range of geologies and climatologies across europe it should be noted that both aquimod and gardénia provide recharge time series while metran provides mean annual values of recharge a total of four contrasting cases are included here spain serbia ireland and sweden these will be briefly introduced in each section 3 2 1 south upper guadiana spain time series 78 the campo de montiel aquifer covers an area of nearly 2200 km2 located within a semiarid region in the upper guadiana basin spain it is mainly composed of limestones and jurassic carbonate formations its altitude varies between 800 and 1000 m asl the mean annual temperature is about 14 c annual precipitation varies between 400 and 500 mm the predominantly dry climate and the prevalence of irrigated agriculture mainly supplied with groundwater resources has led to a high and permanent conflict between agriculture and ecosystem conservation with significant impacts on the wetlands protected ramsar sites and aquifers quantity and quality in the past baena ruiz et al 2021 baena ruiz and pulido velazquez 2020 gardénia aquimod and metran modelling tools were employed to estimate groundwater recharge based on more than 35 years of available data from april 1978 to october 2015 in one piezometer the groundwater head time series fig 4a are from an unconfined aquifer and are related to recharge the mean recharge values fig 5a obtained with gardénia aquimod and metran are 69 4 mm year 69 8 mm year and 421 mm year respectively the differences between the mean recharge estimated by applying gardénia or aquimod with respect to site specific model 66 2 mm year table 1 are not significant maximum of 5 6 meanwhile the mean recharge obtained with metran is significantly greater metran was run for 10 time series in the basin but only succeeded in producing a model for one even though this model passed the statistical test it has been also dismissed as it has almost no evapotranspiration response indicating that groundwater fluctuations are independent of evapotranspiration the long time series make it possible to perform a sensitivity analysis of the results for the period of data employed to calibrate and validate the gardénia and aquimod models three calibration scenarios were carried out using the entire dataset and 70 and 50 of the period while the rest of the dataset was reserved for validation table 3 shows the mean recharge in the period 1978 2015 and the goodness of fit in the simulated groundwater levels obtained for different calibration scenarios both models provide similar mean recharge values and acceptable results in groundwater level forecast in this case study most aquimod models provide a slightly better simulation of groundwater level than gardénia although the estimated recharge provided by gardénia is more similar to the site specific model table 4 fig s1 of the electronic supplementary material esm shows the observed and simulated groundwater levels obtained with the different calibrated models in the period 1978 2015 it shows that both models gardénia and aquimod have the ability to reproduce groundwater levels within the different validation periods therefore in addition to assessing groundwater recharge they can be employed as tools for short term groundwater level forecasting 3 2 2 east posavina serbia time series 76 borehole affected by river stage the pilot area posavina is situated in the sava river basin in serbia and is mostly covered with quaternary sediments this area stretches from the border with croatia on the west to belgrade in the east and from fruška gora mountain in the north to cer mountain in the south the territory covers an area of about 5250 km2 and the sava river catchment size is 9057 km2 the major groundwater reserves are accumulated in thick quaternary sediments where high yield intergranular aquifers are formed the aquifer is recharged from precipitation and groundwater inflow however the main inflows to this aquifer are from surface waters the analysis of the groundwater regime indicates that the influence of the river on the groundwater table weakens with distance from sava river to simulate groundwater recharge and prediction of future groundwater levels aquimod and metran models were applied aquimod represents the groundwater system as a closed homogeneous medium with no impact from any outer boundary or feature whether physical or hydrological with the significant influence of river stages on groundwater heads it was therefore not possible to obtain a good aquimod model fig 4c metran on the other hand succeeded in capturing the groundwater dynamics fig 4c but only when the river water levels were added as an additional input signal 3 2 3 west ireland time series 15 16 17 18 20 31 33 34 aquifer complexity the boreholes are placed in the southeast part of ireland and where the river basins of the suir nore barrow and slaney rivers as well as a number of smaller coastal river catchments are located the main aquifers of interest are diffusely karstified limestone aquifers and extensive glacio fluvial sand and gravel aquifers groundwater from these regionally important aquifers provides up to 90 of the public water supply in some counties is important for agricultural and industrial uses and supports many small private supplies groundwater surface water interaction is significant and baseflows are high where rivers cross the principal aquifers the karst aquifers occupy the valleys and lowlands and are generally unconfined permeability varies with depth due to fracturing and karstification sands and gravels occur mainly along the major rivers but also form extensive domes groundwater is generally unconfined and flow pathways are simple the remainder of the area is underlain by poorly productive fissured bedrock aquifers the karstic and fissured bedrock aquifers have low effective porosity and very limited storage which renders them vulnerable to altered winter recharge patterns and extended dry periods effective rainfall is lowest in southeast ireland and there are currently concerns about water resources availability and demand and it is anticipated that this area will become progressively water stressed under future climate change scenarios aquimod and metran were applied to all eight groundwater level monitoring records fig 3 while six were simulated by gardénia detailed examples are shown on fig 4e figure f and fig s2b c s3b c esm the 30 year average 1981 2010 groundwater recharge for catchments to the eight boreholes were also estimated using the updated irish national recharge map hunter williams et al 2021 nses for aquimod historical simulations range from 0 36 to 0 86 and 0 24 0 8 for gardénia a lower limit of 0 5 was chosen for acceptance six of eight aquimod simulations and four of six gardénia exceed that lower limit four of eight metran models have the highest acceptance one was acceptable and three were insufficient metran recharge estimates are consistently higher than aquimod gardénia and the national model aquimod estimates tend to be lower or the same as the national model with no systematic pattern for gardénia results the reasons for differences or difficulties in calibrating are likely to be multiple and different depending on the site metran seems to be most applicable to gravel aquifers and more straightforward karst groundwater systems at two sites riverine influence on groundwater level is suspected metran does not calibrate without the river stage as explanatory variable using gardénia requires river flow data for the most robust simulations due to the lateral heterogeneity within irish catchments it is possible that the groundwater level variations are not representative of the nearest gauging stations which encompass a much larger catchment gardénia also requires a full calendar year of data and does not allow missing head data while the other models do overall aquimod seems to be most suited to simulation of groundwater levels in the irish aquifers included however it should be noted that the more complicated karst and fractured bedrock aquifers required two layer models at least to better represent the groundwater flow systems and more remains to be done in this regard clearly a good historical model fit will not guarantee predictive power in future climate change scenarios since different recharge dynamics timings and groundwater stages are likely to interact non linearly with the heterogeneous aquifers 3 2 4 north böda kinda sweden time series 1 2 snow cover projections in rural areas of sweden the supply of drinking water typically relies on private wells drilled in crystalline bedrock which drain the storage of the overlying soil layers typically up to a few meters of till in many areas groundwater storage is limited by low effective porosity and compartmentalised fragmented soil coverage this limited storage implies that the drinking water consumption must be in close balance with the recharge not only in terms of the long term means but more importantly with seasonal drought patterns otherwise the groundwater aquifers are in risk of depletions seasonal droughts are periods when the recharge is negligible such that any water consumption relies on drainage of groundwater storage the groundwater storage determines therefore the upper bound for consumption during the drought period and the vulnerability to the length of the drought period in turn this implies that the main concern of the ongoing climate changes is the signs of longer seasonal droughts at present the consumption from private wells is adapted to two types of seasonal droughts 1 winter drought when precipitation is stored as snow dominates in the north and 2 summer drought when interception and evapotranspiration exceed precipitation dominates in the south in areas of substantial snow storage compared to soil storage the snowmelt has the important role of re filling the storages prior to the onset of the summer drought climate change is expected to shift the balance of seasonal patterns from winter drought towards longer summer drought moreover the role of snowmelt for re filling the soil storage will weaken particularly in the south of sweden as the snow storage will diminish more precipitation will fall as rain during winter and the snowmelt will advance to an earlier date thereby elongating the summer drought on the brighter side climate change may shorten the winter drought in northern sweden simulations for the swedish pilots demonstrate the need to account for a retreating snow cover in climate change projections on future recharge and water supply three tools were tested and compared aquimod which does not account for snow storage and gardénia and hype which does account for snow storage all tools could be reasonably well calibrated for the present day situation figs 4g and 5g fig s2a and s3a of the esm the fit for aquimod was nse 0 59 and 0 61 for two pilots whereas it was nse 0 73 0 64 and nse 0 81 0 67 for gardénia and hype respectively obviously this signifies that data calibration is not undisputed evidence of model validity as the conceptual model also needs to capture the key processes involved a classical dilemma of models is that of equifinality beven 1993 where the model produces the right output but for the wrong reasons thus if the models are to be used for the projection of future conditions it is vital that the models are able to correctly represent the processes that are expected to change in the future e g in this case that the projection model includes a snow storage module 3 3 recharge estimations the recharge estimation for all the sites is shown in fig 6 by each of the models metran a aquimod b and gardénia c again as not all study sites have applied all three models some areas are left blank on the graphs recharge results for models with inferior performance are not shown this means that metran results are only shown for a performance of 1 or 2 negative recharge estimations which may be due to local discharge are left out of the plot but are found by metran for the boreholes nl 14 and nl 45 time series 26 30 49 51 one well is in an area that can be connected with an area with artificially managed water levels so here there may be upwelling discharge however this is not the case for the other well there is therefore no physical explanation to this value and the estimate is therefore discarded as mentioned earlier a poor score by metran may indicate that the input time series does not hold enough information to describe the groundwater level fluctuations in the observed time series thus in these cases it is potentially not possible to estimate recharge using the groundwater level data with the available climate and abstraction data and therefore any modelling efforts by aquimod and gardénia could be disregarded however in this case we have chosen to only disregard model results due to the model s own performance therefore gardénia results are shown for simulations with nse 0 7 for both groundwater levels and discharge and aquimod results are shown for all models except for sites where the model performance was deemed unacceptable as mentioned in the section above 4 6 9 20 and 76 as the models are sorted by metran performance the same sorting as fig 5 the aquimod and gardénia models with failed metran score 0 are easily identified as the models with missing columns to the right on fig 6 fig 6d and e show a comparison between the results from the three models the time series may both be from unconfined and confined aquifers and thus for aquimod the recharge estimation is sometimes not recharge fig 6d but inter aquifer leakage fig 6e looking across the results where all three models are used and performance was accepted 22 time series there are very little general agreements between the three models in relation to recharge estimates for some timeseries recharge estimations differ in the order of 700 mm y while much better agreement is reached in others often metran recharge values are higher than the other two tools but not always for the unconfined aquifers 11 time series metran estimates recharge with a mean of 530 mm y for the same boreholes aquimod estimates a mean of 220 mm y while gardénia estimates a mean of 290 mm y thus the uncertainty of recharge estimations is generally high and while multiple methods for assessing recharge exist as these three tools applied here their assumptions and results often deviate substantially as also found by e g dos santos et al 2021 and walker et al 2018 this is supported by a study by walker et al 2018 applying nine different recharge methods on a catchment in ethiopia they found that the range of recharge estimations could be reduced substantially when correctly identifying the recharge type minimum potential actual the appropriate scale of the estimation and accounting for the uncertainty of the method 3 4 comparing recharge estimations to local and national tools the true values of recharge for the sites are unknown therefore in order to try to identify reliable recharge estimates the recharge estimated by the three tools is compared with local and national model results whenever possible fig 6d and e for 32 time series there are recharge estimations from other tools a table of the annual recharge estimates for the 32 sites are available in the esm table s2 a comparison between the three models and the already established local and national results can also be seen in fig 7a from the scatter plot in fig 7a there is an inclination for metran recharge to be higher than the local and national tool estimates above the 1 1 line for aquimod and gardénia points are on both sides of the 1 1 line thus for most of these sites aquimod and gardénia estimates were fairly close to the local and national model results with a mean absolute deviation of 38 and 46 respectively for the gardénia run where discharge is used in the objective function deviation is 29 metran recharge estimations generally were higher with mean absolute deviation of 90 taking out all runs but aquimod and gardénia where metran failed gave similar deviations of 41 and 48 respectively and for gardénia with discharge 27 thus the bias of metran is quite higher than for the other models an investigation of the correlation of the estimates show that the models have similar correlation metran has a correlation pearson of 0 60 to recharge estimates by other tools while aquimod and gardénia correlation are 0 55 and 0 6 respectively to investigate this high bias further recharge values estimated using a larger number of time series in the netherlands by metran are compared to the outputs from the integrated dutch national hydrological model http nhi nu de lange et al 2014 the comparison shows that metran estimates do not compare well with the results from the integrated model fig 8 and there is no visible pattern in the locations with reasonable performance green underestimation yellow or overestimation blue fig 8b metran only uses precipitation and evapotranspiration however its application does not give a reliable estimate of recharge values either net precipitation or net precipitation minus runoff and local drainage this suggests that special conditions or additional information are required to obtain reliable recharge estimates from groundwater head time series in combination with precipitation and evapotranspiration obergfell et al 2019 applied a similar method with the additional constraint that the seasonal harmonic of the observed head matches the sum of the transformed seasonal harmonics of the input variables in the time series model for a specific area to obtain results that compared well with independent estimates however the validity and consequences of this constraint are unknown this study does thus point to aquimod and gardénia being appropriate methods for estimation of recharge when considering the uncertainties inevitably attached to the estimation of groundwater recharge from hydraulic head measurements however it is only possible to validate with other local and national modelling results also prone to uncertainties making this deduction only indicative furthermore this study focuses on diffuse recharge while indirect recharge from streams lakes and rivers are not considered however indirect recharge type are dominant in arid or semidry semi arid areas and if omitted the recharge to the entire aquifer may thus be underestimated for these climatologies 3 5 comparing recharge estimations to pan european estimate fig 6d also includes potential recharge values obtained from the pan eu recharge map martinsen et al 2022 two limitations should be noted in this comparison first the pan eu recharge map is created using the national hydrological model s infiltration coefficient combined with other spatial variables in the machine learning algorithm these are the same national models applied in spain france ireland denmark and the netherlands for which a subset of estimated recharge values was used for comparison to the recharge estimate in the previous section thus these two datasets for comparisons are not entirely independent secondly the values from the recharge map are of potential recharge i e infiltration recharge leaving the soil zone they are not therefore directly comparable to the previous recharge and inter aquifer leakage estimations however this means that pan eu recharge estimation should be equal to or larger than the other estimations as interflow drainage and runoff to surface water have not been removed furthermore the map is generated at eu scale and must therefore be assumed to be less accurate than local models and models like gardénia where the calibration data are used to complete the hydrological balance nonetheless some tendencies in the recharge distribution at some of the sites are replicated e g lower potential recharge in sweden and ireland than in denmark high variability in potential recharge estimates in the uk and lower potential recharge values in france and spain from the scatter plot of the three models and the pan eu recharge map in fig 7b it can be clearly observed that there is a tendency for metran recharge to be above the 1 1 line meaning the recharge values are generally overestimated in relation to the pan eu map for aquimod and gardénia the points are more scattered but with most points being below the 1 1 line as expected noting that the type of recharge calculated by these models is either recharge or inter aquifer leakage rather than the potential recharge provided by the pan eu map the statistics for mean absolute deviation and correlation given in parenthesis are here for aquimod and gardénia deviation of 50 0 41 and 51 0 76 respectively with gardénia with discharge 22 0 68 and metran 112 0 72 4 discussion 4 1 applicability and limitations of the time series models recharge estimation based on groundwater head time series are valuable tools as they require very little data and can be easily and widely applied time series models are a subset of these tools and they however cover a range of different approaches and their applicability limitations and precision are not always well known for some recharge estimation is a by product of the tool and the credibility of this recharge estimation is often uncertainty time series models like metran use precipitation and evapotranspiration combined with abstraction as input for calculating recharge for metran it was shown that there are several problems in using this tool to assess recharge the simulated groundwater head levels may be reasonable or good and close to the measurements for a site the average long term recharge from metran was shown to have a high bias but to correlate fairly well with local and national recharge estimates for the study sites used in this study but on further investigation concerningly low correlation and lack of systematics in the estimations was found when comparing to results from the distributed national model in the netherlands that implies that a reliable estimation of recharge is not possible using metran and this possibly also applies to similar transfer noise models these shortcomings will increase the uncertainty even further if the model is used to predict climate change impact in contrast metran was shown to effectively model groundwater head levels and is therefore a powerful and fast tool for assessing groundwater level the metran model was also successfully used to identify periods of time within a time series where the noise ratio was low thereby assisting in the setup of other recharge estimation models as in boreholes in italy the flexible setup of the model also made it possible to adjust the model to sites where special conditions were governing the hydrology e g at the serbian site near the sava river a more physical description of the recharge process combined with a subsurface representation as in aquimod can help to improve the recharge estimates collenteur et al 2021 peterson and fulton 2019 depending on the available information the choice of representation of the saturated zone may be arbitrary and parameter values may be hard to check for the aquimod model it was found that for several time series it was difficult or not possible to obtain a calibrated model where the other models succeeded in some cases this was related to special conditions at the site that could not be simulated by the model e g river influence in serbia in other cases the model seems to be very sensitive to gaps in the dataset and the quality of the input calibration data this meant in some cases that obtaining a calibrated model was only possible when using part of the dataset e g in italy obviously the lack of a snow module means that the model is less appropriate to apply in snow dominated areas especially for projections into future climate it is the only model of the suite tested that allows the modeller to directly incorporate hydro geological understanding of the area and to investigate inter aquifer leakage to deeper aquifers the model was also found to have good predictive capability regarding groundwater levels as shown in the case of spain the deviations and correlations to local and national models were acceptable for aquimod however despite the inclusion of a physical description of the subsurface aquimod did not always assure the simulation of meaningful recharge estimates in spite of good calibration performance for groundwater levels this is due to the non uniqueness of the problem where equally good groundwater level performance can be obtained by scaling the recharge estimate and or aquifer storage as the water balance is not contained in the modelling framework this issue may to some degree be addressed by investigating all successful aquimod runs during a calibration providing a variation in the recharge estimate that may be further constrained by prior or expert knowledge on recharge magnitudes other tools simple groundwater flow darcy evaluation field measurements it is therefore found that it is preferable to have an additional tool for comparison when applying aquimod for recharge estimation when these limitations are kept in mind aquimod may be used as an informative tool for recharge estimation where percentiles 25th percentile 50th percentile 75th percentile of the estimated recharge values can be calculated based on the accepted model runs the non uniqueness can only be eliminated if the water balance is directly accounted for in the model this is possible in gardénia that can use surface water discharge observations to constrain the recharge depending on knowledge of the surface area of the catchment and the other terms of the water balance determining the true magnitude of the water balance terms for a lumped catchment may be challenging this is especially the case in lowland areas where groundwater and surface water catchment areas may not coincide also in wetlands where there may be multiple surface water connections with varying flow directions for well defined groundwater systems boundary fluxes have little influence if the area is large enough but the relative importance of groundwater abstractions depends on the local situation for karstic system gardénia offers different options depending on the behaviour of the basin there is the possibility of adjusting the area of the watershed or introducing external flows inside the hydrological system or even introducing an external exchange factor for this a robust conceptual model is needed the size of the contribution area of groundwater recharge is generally a very sensitive parameter in gardénia calculations for the different modelled sites in this study only one rain gauged station was used but gardénia does offer the possibility of adjusting the climatic input parameters rain and pet to correct the deviation especially for large surface basins generally the gardénia had relatively low bias and fairly good correlation to the national and local models however like for aquimod application of gardénia is problematic without river discharge information to guide the storage term this was observed at various sites where low recharge to large surface runoff estimates was compensated by a change in the storage coefficient the joint use of groundwater level and discharge data allows a more robust model less subject to the problem of equifinality and investigating the performance of the simulations where discharge was included in the objective function compared to the national and local model showed a similar correlation as for all simulations but a clear improvement in bias thus gardénia is a robust and easy to use model especially with a good knowledge of the hydrological system and reliable data and calibration is quite straightforward with gardénia because of the automatic calibration the study showed very varying estimates of recharge at the different sites and as the true value is unknown it is not possible to firmly identify the model giving the correct recharge nevertheless gardénia was closest to the available national local estimates for the sites especially when discharge was included in the calibration thus the dataset is too limited to draw any firm conclusions and the study should be regarded as the initial steps in identifying the usefulness and precision of these tools for different settings additionally it is found that using long time series 20 years is preferable to improve the confidence in the model results generally results points to that the time series models are especially useful for locations were other factors like abstraction or surface waters influence the water table observations but that very complex and heterogeneous study sites such as karstic areas are problematic difficult to simulate with all models and here more detailed integrated modelling is needed 4 2 can adequate prediction of groundwater level guarantee correct recharge estimation the study shows very varying estimates of recharge at the different sites for models that all have very good performance during calibration thus it is possible to reproduce the observed behaviour of groundwater levels but to perform poorly in the calculation of recharge this may be due to failure of the predictive power or non uniqueness of the model as mentioned above or due to application in hydrological or geological settings that they cannot appropriately represent limitations in model structure the model structure deficiency may get compensated by hydraulic parameter values that are not representative of the hydrogeological system characteristics consequently the user knowledge of the complexity of the hydrogeological system can therefore limit the robustness of the model output and errors are easily made and difficult to identify if only one model is applied therefore applying more than one model on a case is recommend as also mentioned by e g de vries and simmers 2002 this study was limited to three conceptually very different groundwater level models used to estimate groundwater recharge however while several similar and different approaches exist results from this study may not always be directly transferable although the study covers a large and diverse selection of cases in europe it was not possible to cover all climate types and geological settings a valuable next step in this process would therefore be to expand this study by including a large set of tools and sites and thereby developing a formulation of a rigorous scheme for the selection of appropriate recharge estimation tools based on overall study site data characteristics this would be especially useful if the different models and approaches can be integrated and benchmarked against each other and additional independent methods to reduce the overall uncertainty in recharge estimation procedures as demonstrated by crosbie and rachakonda 2021 where recharge from chloride mass balance estimates were constrained using remote sensing the calibration performance of the aquimod and gardénia models and whether the models are deemed acceptable adequate or not are in this case based on expert judgement and best practice even though the applied methodology relies on an automated approach to optimise the solution for example the election of a stricter or relaxed performing measure threshold may lead to different model results being used the evaluation of the model is therefore also a contributor to the uncertainty of the results it is possible that if water balance could somehow be constrained in the aquimod model more runs would succeed as the optimization results could be a different parameter solution in this study the reason for a failure of any of the models to provide reasonable results is sought in specific conditions quality setting of the data and study site however as is true for all modelling work uncertainties are also depended on the choices approach and experience of the modeller thus combining the scheme for the selection of appropriate tools with a more elaborate framework for evaluating whether or not when a model s performance is acceptable or not is a necessary next step when moving forward 4 3 recharge taxonomy in this study we have tried to divide recharge into different recharge types in order to compare the same type of recharge with each other the taxonomy adopted here is coarse and may not always be applicable as mentioned in section 4 1 due to small scale processes it may not always be possible to make a clear distinction between potential recharge and recharge also in multiple aquifer systems recharge and inter aquifer recharge may occur at multiple depths and the depth of the aquifer is in that case important 4 4 limitations in the comparison to other methods a major limitation in the study is the fact that no true values for recharge are known at any of the sites recharge estimations from the three models can therefore only be compared to other modelling numerical or machine learning results which may not represent the correct recharge at the site and are therefore uncertain additional conditioning of the modelling results could be undertaken by obtaining recharge from independent estimations by in situ measurements like chloride mass balance based on deposition from the atmosphere custodio 2010 where a long term recharge can be established or age tracers these measurements were unfortunately not available at the study sites but could potentially be used for evaluating model performance when compared to model estimates other methods like lysimeters also allow direct measurement of recharge however depending on the location of the lysimeter and the variability of the landscape around it the transferability of the measured values to regional water balance or groundwater model will vary because of the typical variability of soil cover and land use fitts 2013 witte et al 2019 the representativity of the measured recharge also varies because of the impact of some land uses and the associated soil treatments on lysimeter functioning voortman et al 2015 furthermore modelling results from local or national models are not available at all sites studies like the investigation done in the netherlands for the metran model utilizing a very high number of sites could be a potential way to improve and test the reliability of the models even though such a study will be extremely time consuming for models like gardénia and aquimod where knowledge of the geology and hydrology are essential to build into the setup 5 conclusions this study compared and analysed results and limitations of three conceptually different groundwater time series models for recharge estimation metran aquimod and gardénia explored across different climatic hydrological and geological settings to facilitate this comparison a recharge taxonomy was developed where recharge is defined in three types 1 potential recharge 2 recharge reaching the phreatic aquifer 3 inter aquifer leakage in lack of true measurements of recharge the groundwater level recharge models are compared to estimation by local and national models for the different sites here it was shown that aquimod and gardénia show deviations of 38 and 46 while metran was somewhat higher 90 the correlation coefficient were similar for the three models but highest for gardénia and here the bias greatly improved when incorporating discharge in the simulation the transfer noise model metran based on groundwater head measurements driven by precipitation and evapotranspiration was shown to be a powerful model for assessing groundwater levels data noise and for incorporating site specific conditions but due to the high bias in combination with a poor correlation seen for a larger sample of dutch boreholes it was found that such transfer function noise models are potentially inaccurate recharge estimation tools and should be used with care the groundwater level driven hydrological model aquimod and the lumped catchment models gardénia both based on climate input and calibration of governing parameters to hydraulic head measurements were generally shown to be successful at simulating groundwater levels however it was shown that special care must be taken when estimating recharge with a model setup without water balance constraints discharge data as in aquimod the non uniqueness means that the best procedure when using these types of models would be to use an ensemble of successful model runs and thereby include an estimation of uncertainty of the recharge estimate and or confine results with alternative information on recharge magnitudes it was found that when water balance is accounted groundwater levels time series models can be very relevant tools for relatively simple study sites where boundary conditions abstraction river affect head fluctuations but for complex and heterogeneous sites more detailed integrated modelling is needed furthermore in light of the uncertainties of the methods applying multiple methods on a site is recommended overall as there is generally a lack of on site recharge measurements for validation of these tools a multiple tools approach is recommended to capture uncertainty ranges when estimating recharge from groundwater heads the large uncertainty of the recharge estimated by any of the tools must thus be considered when applying any of these models for recharge estimation or future prediction funding

level changes groundwater storage change was measured using repeat microgravity at 35 stations from 2016 to 2021 usually storage is monitored by converting groundwater level changes to storage changes

estimated using the gravity method at individual sites and a map created showing how this property varies over the region new hydrological insights for the region for the first time a map of specific yield was produced based on interpolated maps of gravity derived storage change and groundwater level change allowing inference of this property over a broad region even without collocated monitoring wells and gravity stations gravity data indicate aquifer drawdown and recovery mainly occurs in the central part of the basin where pumping is greatest this spatial distribution is not captured by the

frohlich and kelly 1988 tizro et al 2012 and magnetic resonance sounding vouillamoz et al 2012 an inherent limitation of geophysical methods is the requirement for a petrophysical model with its accompanying parameters and uncertainty to convert the measured property e g electrical resistivity to the property of interest e g water content another approach is to estimate specific yield as a parameter during groundwater flow model calibration using either traditional parameter estimation methods malama et al 2016 or hydraulic tomographic methods whereby wells are pumped at different depth intervals liu et al 2020 specific yield can also be estimated using the water table fluctuation method whereby groundwater level changes are measured relative to a known volume of storage change the volume of storage change can be estimated from recharge flux e g using the chloride mass balance method crosbie et al 2019 from known pumping volumes liu et al 2022 or measured using the repeat microgravity method pool and eychaner 1995 blainey et al 2007 in addition to estimating specific yield monitoring storage changes in multi layer aquifer systems is useful for determining the presence or absence of unconfined storage the storage mechanism is important because changes in the water volume stored in confined aquifers generally cause subsidence or uplift and overpumping can lead to irreversible storage capacity loss dahlke et al 2018 on the other hand unconfined water storage changes which occur at the water table are in generally coarser sediments that are less susceptible to over pumping but unconfined water storage change can be problematic because these aquifers are more susceptible to contamination and because excess storage increases can raise the water table above the land surface or mobilize contaminants in the unsaturated zone confined aquifer storage coefficients are generally much smaller than in unconfined aquifers because water is released from storage by decompression of the water and aquifer material as compared to the relatively high storage coefficients specific yield in unconfined aquifers where water is released or stored by draining or saturating pore space at the water table large storage changes determined from gravity measurements that are correlated with groundwater level changes indicate the presence of unconfined storage change possibly in addition to confined storage change whereas small storage changes during periods of large groundwater level change indicate confined conditions pool 2008 the timing between groundwater levels and storage change can also be used to investigate delayed storage changes neuman 1972 gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2021 a process by which water is not released or stored instantaneously following a groundwater level change due to capillary pressure retaining water during drainage or air entrapment below a rising water table repeat microgravity provides a direct noninvasive method for measuring groundwater storage change which in turn is effective for estimating specific yield using the horizontal infinite slab approximation 1 m of free standing water is equivalent to a 41 9 µgal gravity change changes in the acceleration due to gravity measured using sensitive gravimeters are linearly related to changes in groundwater storage regardless of depth to water or aquifer porosity the method has been used extensively to map storage changes from the land surface e g gehman et al 2009 kennedy et al 2016 carruth et al 2018 and from space scanlon et al 2015 rateb et al 2020 but there are very few basin scale terrestrial gravity networks with accompanying monitoring well networks e g carruth et al 2018 we extend the traditional site specific method of estimating specific yield pool and eychaner 1995 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2021 to a map based application where instead of point measurements of specific yield a map of storage change interpolated from point repeat microgravity measurements is compared to a map of groundwater level change also interpolated from point measurements this is the first known investigation to combine extensive repeat microgravity data groundwater level monitoring and high resolution data on high volume groundwater pumping to understand storage change and determine specific yield across a basin furthermore the extensive use of absolute gravity measurements in conjunction with modern low drift relative gravimeters provides better accuracy than previous gravity mapping efforts that have typically used relative gravimeters alone in this paper we demonstrate the application of a network of repeat microgravity stations and groundwater monitoring wells to monitor the effect of groundwater management decisions that is the choice of when and where to pump and recharge groundwater on the timing and location of groundwater storage change and the implications for confined vs unconfined storage change from these data specific yield is estimated at individual sites where a relation exists between groundwater level and gravity derived storage change unique to this study sufficient data exist to interpolate independent surfaces of storage change and groundwater level change at the basin kilometers scale from this an interpolated surface of specific yield is calculated finally the relation between the volume of storage change and volume of groundwater pumped is examined and used to estimate net inflow within a control volume 2 study area the study area is in the city of albuquerque new mexico and surrounding bernalillo county an area that relies on a combination of surface water and groundwater for public water supply beginning in late 2008 with the completion of the san juan chama drinking water project water treatment facilities in albuquerque the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority water authority incorporated additional surface water supply and so consequently reduced their groundwater pumping beginning a decade long period of increasing groundwater storage that is inflow to the aquifer was greater than outflow in the central well field where a large cone of depression had developed galanter and curry 2019 to monitor groundwater storage change associated with this shift in water supply the existing monitoring well network was augmented with a repeat gravity network in 2016 the study area comprises an extensive basin fill aquifer in oligocene to pliocene santa fe group sediments lozinsky 1994 the central part of the study area is heavily urbanized whereas little development has occurred in outlying areas climate is temperate with average monthly temperatures ranging from 13 c january to 25 c july and average 1990 2020 rainfall ranging from less than 25 cm at the basin floor to greater than 60 cm some as snow at higher elevations in the sandia mountains prism climate group 2022 most surface runoff from storms is conveyed by large concrete lined channels towards the north south trending rio grande the only significant perennial stream reach in the study area the study focuses on a 10 km east west by 20 km north south area between the rio grande to the west elevation ca 1500 m above sea level and the sandia mountains 3255 m to the east and between kirtland air force base and paseo del norte blvd to the south and north respectively fig 1 an extensive productive aquifer underlies this area in the cenozoic sierra ladrones formation of the santa fe group and the more recent basin and valley fill deposits which are composed primarily of interbedded gravel sand silt and clay fluvial and basin fill sediments fig 2 the sierra ladrones formation and the recent deposits are hydraulically connected and termed the santa fe group aquifer system bartolino and cole 2002 localized confining layers exist in the aquifer but the study area is generally characterized as a fully saturated multilayer aquifer with an uppermost unconfined layer heywood 1997 groundwater flow in this area is generally unaffected by major faults plummer et al 2003 however analysis of land subsidence data for albuquerque indicates that faults in specific areas may act as barriers to lateral groundwater flow driscoll and brandt 2017 specific yield in the basin has been estimated to be 0 20 based on groundwater modeling studies kernodle et al 1995 mcada and barroll 2002 and this value has been used in previous investigations to convert groundwater level change to storage change rinehart et al 2016 historically the albuquerque region has relied on groundwater for municipal and industrial needs with surface water used for irrigation primarily near the rio grande the water authority pumps water from 17 well fields comprising about 60 wells throughout the region fig 1 ritchie and pepin 2020 with additional pumping by other entities as of water year 2000 the water authority accounted for about 77 of the pumping in the entire study area fig 1 and 90 of the pumping east of interstate 25 mcada and barroll 2002 beginning in late 2008 water authority groundwater withdrawals were reduced and augmented with surface water from the san juan chama drinking water project abcwua 2022 water authority groundwater withdrawals pumpage decreased from an average of about 121 106 m3 1 106 m3 811 acre feet per year for the 2003 2008 period to about 58 106 m3 for the 2016 2021 period galanter and curry 2019 abcwua 2022 resulting in widespread recovery of groundwater levels fig 3 pumpage increased in 2020 2021 to meet demand during a period of decreased rio grande flows pumping is typically from the deeper parts of the aquifer 200 400 m below land surface with production wells screened at or below the water table wells were initially screened about 30 m and deeper below the water table but drawdown has caused the water table to intersect the screened intervals at some locations the largest amount of non water authority pumping about 16 0 106 m3 yr is in rio rancho about 15 km northwest of the study area and west of the rio grande stroud and kilmer 2016 and in the southern part of the study area on kirtland air force base kirtland pumpage was 3 6 106 m3 in 2020 mean annual pumpage was less at 1 0 0 07 106 m3 for the 2010 2020 period sandia national laboratories 2021 the amount of other pumpage from private wells is largely unknown there are thousands of individual domestic wells in the western part of the study area stroud and kilmer 2016 recharge in the study area is primarily mountain block recharge from the sandia mountains to the east streambed infiltration from the rio grande and recharge facilities total inflow and outflow for the groundwater basin an area larger than the study area for the year 1999 was estimated to be about 634 106 m3 and 709 106 m3 respectively with the balance 75 106 m3 removed from storage mcada and barroll 2002 because of high amounts of impervious area and high evapotranspiration direct land surface recharge is likely small although some recharge likely occurs from septic systems water distribution system leaks and irrigated areas myers and friesz 2019 a cone of depression from pumping exists between the rio grande and the sandia mountains inducing recharge from both sources fig 1 west of a north south line between stations sici and fox fig 1 recharge is primarily from the rio grande east of this line recharge is primarily mountain front recharge from the east plummer et al 2003 the water authority recharges water through an injection well screened 122 366 m below land surface site asr1 also named wtf1 in kennedy and bell 2023 and at the bear canyon in channel recharge project where water infiltrates into a dry arroyo streambed 3 methods this study relies primarily on groundwater level data collected at monitoring wells and piezometers in the study area and repeat microgravity data the albuquerque groundwater level monitoring network includes hourly observations at about 47 wells and piezometers at 15 locations and annual or semi annual observations at 90 100 wells ritchie and pepin 2020 many locations have 3 or more piezometers open at different levels in the aquifer which are useful for evaluating vertical gradients that have the potential to cause upward or downward groundwater flow groundwater level data are available in the u s geological survey usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2022 and are published in usgs data reports e g jurney and bell 2021 and as water level change maps e g galanter and curry 2019 a repeat microgravity network consisting of up to 35 locations was established in 2016 and visited three times per year surveys used a combination of zls corporation burris relative gravity meters and a micro g lacoste inc a 10 absolute gravity meter following the methods described in kennedy et al 2021a although global positioning system data were collected during each absolute gravity measurement about 30 min per occupation no land surface elevation changes were observed that were larger than the uncertainty provided by opus rs processing online positioning user service rapid static national geodetic survey 2022 extensometer and interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar data indicate 1 cm or less overall vertical displacement since 2000 with maximum annual fluctuations of 0 003 0 004 m related to groundwater pumping driscoll and brandt 2017 given the small gravity effect this displacement causes 0 003 m land surface elevation change is about 1 µgal of gravity change and the lack of comprehensive elevation change data during the study period gravity data were not corrected for elevation change absolute and relative gravity data were combined using least squares network adjustment implemented in gsadjust software kennedy 2020 which provides a best fit gravity value at each station for each survey while accounting for measurement uncertainty input data for the network adjustment are observed absolute gravity values transferred to the relative gravity meter height using the measured vertical gravity gradient at each site and relative gravity differences between stations relative gravity meter drift was estimated by visiting each relative gravity station at least twice during a survey and corrected using the roman time interpolation method roman 1946 a relative gravity meter calibration coefficient was calculated for each survey by including it as a parameter in the least squares adjustment for each survey the chi square goodness of fit statistic was evaluated and the relative gravity difference standard deviations were scaled such that the network reference factor was equal to 1 the gravity station naming convention is lowercase for relative gravity only stations and uppercase for stations that also or only include absolute gravity measurements gravity change between surveys was converted to storage change using the horizontal infinite slab approximation 1 t g 41 9 where δg is the gravity change between any two surveys in microgal and δt is the estimated change in storage in units of meters of free standing water pool and eychaner 1995 notably this relation does not depend on the depth to water that is the same relation holds for shallow and deep water tables nor aquifer specific yield gravity data were not corrected for near surface soil moisture changes in urbanized areas such as the study area land surface infiltration is minimized by extensive impervious area some stations are in parks typically between a parking lot and irrigated turf area although soil moisture may be high in the irrigated areas the gravity signal is only sensitive to changes in soil moisture which are minimized by regular irrigation nonetheless irrigation may contribute to the seasonal signal apparent at some stations maps showing storage change and groundwater level change were generated by ordinary no underlying trend kriging interpolation matheron 1963 as implemented in gstools müeller et al 2022 for each successive period between gravity surveys year to year change for each season and cumulative change over longer periods the semivariogram range 12 500 m or distance at which correlation reaches its minimum was taken from previously developed semivariograms for the study area ritchie and pepin 2020 the spherical semivariogram for storage change fit to observed gravity changes between all time periods had a nugget correlation at 0 distance and sill equal to 0 0091 equivalent to a 4 µgal standard deviation of the gravity change between surveys the spherical semivariogram for groundwater level change had a nugget of 0 0001 equivalent to a 0 014 m standard deviation between water level measurements and a sill of 0 02 spatial patterns in the kriged surfaces were driven primarily by the data values and were relatively insensitive to semivariogram parameters for the purpose of interpolation all 22 gravity stations in the eastern part of the study area were included but results are clipped to a control volume polygon kriging interpolation provides an estimate of uncertainty at each location as a function of the nugget variance at zero distance and sill variance at the specified range kriged variance is a function of these parameters and the distance from measurement locations for this study the gravity data have greater measurement uncertainty but interpolation distances are generally less whereas the groundwater level data have lower measurement uncertainty but distances between wells are greater to estimate uncertainty of the specific yield surface the kriged variance of the individual storage and groundwater level change surfaces must be combined combining the variance as percent uncertainty x standard deviation x is impractical as the values are often near zero which leads to undefined percent uncertainty therefore the kriged variance of the gravity and groundwater level surfaces was combined directly 2 σ sy σ s 2 σ gwl 2 2 where σ s 2 is the kriged storage change variance in units of meters of water and σ gwl 2 is the kriged groundwater level change variance in units of meters site specific specific yield analyses were carried out by plotting the relation between storage change and groundwater level change specific yield is equal to the slope of the best fit line determined from linear regression at each location groundwater levels were taken from the piezometer with the shallowest screened interval representing the uppermost unconfined aquifer the effect of delayed storage change was evaluated by testing different lag intervals to maximize the r2 of the storage change groundwater level change relation one dimensional gravity derived storage change during the approximate four month period between each gravity survey was converted to a volume of water by summing the kriged survey to survey change within a polygon control volume encompassing the gravity stations and pumping wells in the east central well field total pumping during this period was calculated by summing the average monthly pumpage for the preceding four month period only monthly pumping data were available for the analysis monthly well pumping for each well was provided by the water authority katherine yuhas albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority unpublished data 2022 4 results 4 1 timing and location of storage changes for each gravity survey about 90 relative gravity differences and 8 absolute gravity values were observed over a period of two weeks or less the mean absolute relative gravity residual difference between observed and adjusted gravity differences for all surveys was 5 2 1 2 µgal 1 standard deviation the average absolute gravity residual was 5 6 3 4 µgal mean standard deviation of the adjusted gravity values at each station ranged from 2 0 to 6 0 µgal additional details about the gravity data processing are in the accompanying data release kennedy and bell 2023 long term groundwater level records fig 3 show the effect of reduced pumping beginning in late 2008 pumping by the water authority reduced from about 113 106 m3 in 2008 to 71 5 102008 71 5 106 m3 in 2010 groundwater levels recovered across the basin despite ongoing groundwater withdrawals of about 34 5 67 8 106 m3 per year until 2020 when increased groundwater pumping was required to meet municipal needs water levels across the basin generally decreased in 2020 and 2021 relative to their highest point in late 2019 groundwater storage trends from repeat microgravity data generally agree with groundwater level changes fig 3 changes are largest at stations near the historic cone of depression hoff mesa and smaller at more distant stations nest the general trend of increasing groundwater levels and storage followed by decreasing groundwater levels and storage however is consistent at every station east of the rio grande in addition to long term trends groundwater levels show a seasonal pattern related to increased water demand in summertime fig 3 but these are less visible in the three times per year gravity data at some locations such as jcli and sici groundwater levels can decrease by a meter or more almost instantaneously after summertime pumping begins at these locations this causes the vertical gradient to reverse from potential upward flow during non pumping or lightly pumping periods to potential downward flow during the periods of heaviest pumping based on head measured in piezometers screened at different depths in the aquifer fig 4 this results in unconfined storage change at the water table being delayed relative to pumping as the head change propagates through the aquifer and provides evidence that groundwater pumped from deeper parts of the aquifer is connected to groundwater in unconfined storage at the top of the aquifer although vertical movement of groundwater may be limited locally by the presence of discontinuous confining units travis and myers 2019 storage change can be calculated between any two surveys between successive surveys between annual surveys at the same time of year or over longer periods fig 5 relative to the volume of groundwater pumped open circles in fig 5 the gravity data better capture the spatial extent of pumping related storage change in part this is simply because there are more gravity stations at closer spacing than there are wells notably the albuquerque groundwater level monitoring network is one of the most extensive in the southwestern us established at significant cost over several years in comparison the gravity network was established over a few weeks at little cost other than personnel time to investigate potential measurement locations for the 2019 04 to 2019 08 period fig 5a a seasonal decrease in storage is visible in the central part of the well field southwestern part of the control volume during this warm season period of heavier groundwater pumping for irrigation the rest of the area shows the continuing increase in storage from the long term trend beginning around 2010 fig 3 groundwater levels are at their highest point during the study in 2019 and show little change during this period for the 2018 12 to 2019 12 period fig 5b groundwater level increases were nearly the same at each monitoring well location whereas increases in storage occurred primarily in the area where pumping wells are concentrated as the cone of depression from historical pumping continued to recover during this period the effect is to overestimate the increase in storage if only groundwater level data were used most of the east half of the interpolated groundwater level change is determined by three locations no wells are present to the southeast where storage decrease occurs during this period at the northernmost well gravity station usgs site no 351114106330603 nest and easternmost well usgs site no 350653106311602 math storage change is slightly negative and groundwater level change is slightly positive fig 3 possibly reflecting delayed drainage effects of seasonal groundwater pumping but also measurement noise although repeat gravity measurements have relatively high uncertainty they may better represent the state of the groundwater system at one particular time because storage changes occur slowly on the other hand groundwater levels in the study area can change rapidly which creates uncertainty in the exact time interval that should be considered when interpreting groundwater levels to determine storage change e g should exact 1 year intervals be used or the water level immediately prior to the onset of spring pumping regardless of the exact date for the 2019 04 to 2021 04 period fig 5c annual pumping was greater than during the previous 10 year period the gravity measured storage change shows substantial decreases in storage relative to the groundwater level changes which are minimal this period includes the 2020 pumping season during which storage and groundwater levels declined substantially during winter 2020 2021 groundwater levels rebounded to nearly their 2019 level but without an accompanying increase in storage during this period the two data types represent different parts of the aquifer head in the deeper parts of the aquifer is represented by groundwater levels and storage at the water table the shallower unconfined aquifer is represented by the repeat microgravity data calculating the change in groundwater storage from groundwater level change alone would underestimate the decrease in storage for the 2017 08 to 2021 08 period the longest period during which all stations were surveyed an increase in groundwater storage the result of the long term trend in storage beginning in 2010 augmented by managed aquifer recharge is present in the northwest and northeast parts of the control volume and decreases exist in the central and southern parts fig 5d these are somewhat mirrored by groundwater level changes although the monitoring well network is unable to capture the storage increases from managed recharge and the decrease in water levels overestimates storage change because values are interpolated across broad areas with no data storage increases can be seen locally at two locations where the water authority recharges water the surface water treatment facility asr1 and bear canyon at the former 1 62 106 m3 of water have been recharged from 2019 through 2021 abcwua 2022 gravity increases related to this recharge at station asr1 fig 3 and fig 5 are only visible in the last two surveys in 2021 the spatial extent of this recharge is difficult to determine from the present microgravity network but it is not apparent at any of the adjacent stations the relatively large magnitude of this increase about 35 µgal indicates at least some of the injected water is stored at the water table and or has displaced water at the water table if the increase was only in confined storage the expected gravity change would be much smaller however the limited spatial extent of recharged water likely indicates the assumptions of the horizontal infinite slab approximation are not satisfied and the equivalent volume of free standing water is less than that relation 41 9 µgal 1 m of water would indicate storage change at bear canyon miller et al 2021 generally increases in the downstream direction west from the outfall where water is artificially discharged fig 6 the increase was maximum 104 108 µgal at the two stations in the center of the reach bcn1 and bcn4 250 m and 400 m downstream respectively the increase in storage was delayed but more sustained at station bcn2 about 100 m away from the channel and bcn6 about 200 m away from the channel than at the other stations which are adjacent to the channel the smaller increase in storage in 2020 2021 is likely caused by the smaller amount of water delivered and by the timing about 0 70 106 m3 were recharged in winter 2018 2019 and about 0 25 106 m3 were recharged in winter 2020 2021 kelsey bicknell albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority unpublished data 2022 fig 6 recharge in 2018 2019 occurred near the end of the 10 year period of storage increase caused by reduced pumping whereas 2020 2021 recharge occurred at the end of several months of increased pumping fig 3 the decrease in storage between recharge cycles and the absence of an accumulated increase in groundwater storage indicates the facility is working as intended water must move away from the facility after each recharge cycle to accommodate the next cycle recharge at bear canyon has resulted in relatively local increases in groundwater storage the largest changes were excluded from kriging interpolation of the regional surface fig 5 and fig 8 because of their influence however the influence of bear canyon recharge is visible in surrounding stations such as station star 1 3 km south southeast from the facility fig 6 because of the three dimensional shallow nature of storage change at bear canyon the horizontal infinite slab approximation is likely not appropriate and the gravity data must be interpreted through hydrologic modeling to fully investigate the extent and magnitude of storage changes e g kennedy et al 2016 4 2 specific yield site specific specific yield estimates were obtained at eight sites table 1 and fig 7 at three of the four sites shown in fig 7 specific yield is estimated to be 0 21 0 22 at the fourth site math specific yield is somewhat less about 0 10 this site is further east than the others away from the deepest part of the historic cone of depression together these results agree well with the map based estimate of specific yield described later at two of the 10 sites where specific yield analysis was carried out hrun and wght table 1 the estimated specific yield was negative because the overall trend at these sites was decreasing storage accompanied by increasing or steady groundwater levels these two sites and two others with uncertain specific yield estimates svis nest are relatively far from nearby pumping and do not exhibit the same increase followed by decrease storage and groundwater level trends seen at most of the other sites also the magnitude of groundwater level change is relatively small about 0 5 m at hrun and 0 3 m at wght resulting in more uncertainty in the regression analysis these specific yield estimates apply to the vertical interval of the aquifer where the water table occurs at each monitoring well the map based approach to estimating specific yield from interpolated surfaces of storage change and gravity change involves simply dividing the interpolated storage change in each grid cell by the interpolated groundwater level change it has the advantages of providing a specific yield estimate at every point as is required for groundwater modeling and it reduces the requirement for collocated gravity stations and monitoring wells the approach is most effective where the gravity and groundwater networks have relatively high station density to maximize the magnitude of storage change used in the specific yield analysis and therefore the accuracy of the estimate the dec 2017 to dec 2019 period was analyzed fig 8 only the control volume area fig 5 where data density is highest was considered both storage and groundwater levels increased uniformly across the control volume during this period with the greatest increases for both data types in the central area and to the southwest the resultant specific yield field is smoothly varying with minimal bullseye artifacts from the spatial interpolation the interpolated specific yield ranges from 0 05 to 0 4 confirming the presence of storage changes occurring in the uppermost unconfined aquifer throughout the area uncertainty standard deviation in the interpolated specific yield calculated using eq 2 ranges from 0 082 to 0 115 with a mean value of 0 098 the gravity groundwater relation provides evidence for delayed storage change relative to groundwater level data first the rapid declines in groundwater level most evident during early summer 2020 fig 3 are not accompanied by rapid decreases in storage instead a gradual decline in storage begins in 2020 second estimates of specific yield are improved when gravity data are lagged behind groundwater level data for the comparison that is the representative interval for the groundwater level change is some days before the interval of the corresponding gravity change during drainage this effect is caused by water retained in the unsaturated zone by capillary pressure and during imbibition rising water table it is caused by air entrapment the optimal lag interval ranged from 2 to 57 days with a median value of 16 days table 1 although this provides only a rough estimate of the delayed yield effect the effect was consistent in direction r2 always decreased when groundwater level change was lagged behind storage change and relatively uniform in magnitude the delay between pumping and storage change could be better resolved with continuous e g hourly gravity data as is possible with stationary instruments such as superconducting gravity meters and temperature stabilized relative meters 4 3 correlation between pumping gravity change and water level change gravity derived storage change is well correlated with groundwater pumping within the control volume r2 0 81 fig 9 two periods were excluded from the regression the 2016 12 to 2017 05 period which was before the full gravity network was established and data are sparse and the 2019 08 to 2019 12 period for which gravity data indicated large decreases in storage in the far southeast part of the network the reason for this large decrease is unknown but it may be related to unknown error in the relative gravity data or by pumping outside the control volume area where data are sparse uncertainty standard deviation for the storage change estimates was determined by summing the variance estimate for each cell provided by kriging and taking the square root standard deviation of the storage change estimates 0 10 106 to 0 14 106 cubic meters was small relative to the magnitude of the estimates 12 5 106 to 21 4 106 cubic meters this method of calculating uncertainty summing in quadrature assumes error in each kriged cell is independent and may underestimate the actual uncertainty if there is bias in the kriged surface several conclusions can be drawn from the storage change vs pumping relation fig 9 first storage change ranges from 12 5 to 21 4 106 m3 despite positive net pumping during each 120 day period this indicates substantial recharge is entering the control volume although the source of the recharge river seepage mountain block front recharge or land surface recharge cannot be determined from this study previous studies using geochemical tracers indicate the western part of the fig 5 control volume receives recharge from the rio grande the eastern part from the sandia mountains and land surface recharge is minimal plummer et al 2003 travis et al 2021 the magnitude of recharge entering the control volume is about 15 4 106 m3 per 120 day period the x intercept of the regression line in fig 9 pumping above this amount results in a decrease in aquifer storage in this area whereas pumping below this amount results in an increase this relation is likely affected by the history of pumping in the area which causes increased recharge than would otherwise occur as the depressed potentiometric surface associated with the historic cone of depression recovers without historic pumping in this area recharge into the control volume would likely be less and the change in storage would be zero at steady state the slope of the best fit line 1 78 0 26 is significantly different than 1 suggesting that storage change is likely affected by other non water authority pumping in the area in other words as the water authority increases their pumping other entities also pump greater amounts expanding the control volume to encompass more distant pumping would decrease the accuracy of the storage change estimate because it requires extrapolation of storage change data over long distances from the observation locations to create the interpolated kriged surface 5 discussion this study builds on previous efforts to estimate specific yield where gravity stations are collocated with monitoring wells e g pool and eychaner 1995 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2021 unlike previous efforts we present a map showing specific yield across a region rather than site specific estimates restricted to monitoring well locations gravity stations can be located nearly anywhere on the land surface whereas wells are in fixed pre existing locations as long as sufficient groundwater level data exist to interpolate a map of water level change and storage change is sufficiently large to generate a gravity signal the method we present can efficiently generate a map of specific yield for any particular region furthermore the continuous daily groundwater level data available for this study allowed investigation of the time lag between water level change and storage change previous efforts relied on groundwater level data collected on the same day as gravity data validating the specific yield estimates is difficult because specific yield can vary depending on the method volume of subsurface analyzed and duration of the testing neuman 1987 lv et al 2021 differences between the site specific specific yield estimate fig 7 and the kriged estimate fig 8 although small are primarily a function of the semivariogram nugget i e the weight placed on the observed values in the kriging interpolation and could be made smaller or larger depending on the choice of nugget although specific yield estimates may have been obtained from pumping tests when production wells were first installed these exist only in consultant s reports and are not readily available published aquifer property values are primarily specific capacity and hydraulic conductivity e g connell et al 1998 and previous modeling efforts heywood 1997 myers and friesz 2019 assumed a constant specific yield value of 0 20 and 0 12 respectively because more localized data were unavailable the storage change results in particular the relation between gravity determined storage change and independently measured groundwater pumping demonstrate the benefit of repeat microgravity storage change monitoring for estimating basin scale recharge a fundamental challenge for calculating water budgets devlin and sophocleous 2005 and groundwater modeling sanford 2002 scanlon et al 2002 without direct measurement of storage change recharge must be estimated as the balance of other fluxes entering or exiting the region or from precipitation and climate data for this study the volume of municipal pumping is well known but other fluxes non municipal pumping land surface and incidental recharge mountain block recharge rio grande seepage evapotranspiration are poorly constrained by measuring storage change directly the balance of these fluxes inflow minus outflow can be estimated without needing precise estimates of each direct measurement also eliminates the need to convert groundwater level changes to storage change for reporting and regulatory purposes e g rinehart et al 2016 the connection between the uppermost unconfined aquifer and deeper aquifers where pumping wells are screened indicated by the correlation between storage and pumping has implications for water quality significant groundwater contamination exists in the southern part of the study area travis et al 2021 in the upper part of the aquifer i e within the unconfined aquifer where storage changes occur as shown here and by travis and myers 2019 pumping from deeper parts of the aquifer can reverse the normally upward gradient and may create the potential for groundwater to flow downward toward pumping well screens this could result in transport of contaminants to deeper parts of the aquifer where it can enter the drinking water supply depending on the presence and integrity of confining units 6 conclusion repeat microgravity and groundwater level monitoring were used to estimate the effect of groundwater management decisions on aquifer storage change and to estimate specific yield in the albuquerque new mexico region both data sets capture the increase in groundwater storage from 2016 to 2019 caused by reduced groundwater pumping and the subsequent decrease in 2020 2021 caused by increased pumping specific yield was determined from site specific analyses at collocated gravity stations and wells and by interpolating storage change and groundwater level change surfaces site specific specific yield ranged from 0 04 to 0 39 and estimates were in good agreement with the interpolation approach using kriged surfaces of storage change and groundwater level change relatively large storage changes correlated with groundwater level changes indicate water is being removed from unconfined storage although there is likely a days to weeks delay between changes in pumping which takes place primarily at deeper levels in the aquifer and changes in storage at the water table as head changes propagate through the multilayer aquifer the relation between storage change and groundwater level change provides evidence for delayed drainage following the onset of pumping gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2021 storage change is correlated with groundwater pumping volume reported by the water authority but the slope of the regression storage change 1 78 pumping indicates additional pumping other than from those wells considered in the control volume approach likely contributes to the change in storage within the control volume repeat microgravity like all methods has limitations foremost the method depends on an adequate signal to noise ratio absent municipal scale pumping or artificial recharge aquifer storage changes are often below the detection limit e g kennedy et al 2018 noise can be relatively high for repeat microgravity measurements especially relative to the centimeter accuracy provided by groundwater level measurements noise comes from the instruments themselves schmerge and francis 2006 from seismic vibration of the land surface and from other unaccounted processes that influence gravity such as soil moisture change atmospheric pressure changes and ocean loading together these noise factors limit the precision of measurements of aquifer storage change to 3 5 µgal at best or 0 07 0 12 m of free standing water other limitations are the cost of instrumentation up to several hundred thousand us dollars and the speed with which surveys can be carried out a network of 100 stations is about the upper practical limit for the number that can be observed in a single snapshot of the aquifer the present study and future ones could be improved by increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of the data gravity data collected three times per year provide only a general level understanding of the aquifer hourly measurements made using stationary instruments could be particularly effective in the study area for real time monitoring and better understanding the time delay between pumping and storage change this study has several implications beyond the immediate study area first it demonstrates that high precision repeat microgravity data can be effectively and efficiently collected over a large region over a period of several years because of improved instrumentation and processing techniques kennedy 2020 kennedy et al 2021a these data can be incorporated in a routine monitoring program and also applied to advanced aquifer characterization through hydraulic tomography tsai et al 2017 second the unconsolidated basin fill deposits in the albuquerque area with an uppermost unconfined aquifer and interbedded fluvial and piedmont deposits are typical of basin fill deposits throughout the southwestern united states and the world aquifers in these deposits are used extensively for public water supply and this use will increase under future population growth and increasing managed aquifer recharge cost effective non invasive monitoring provided by repeat microgravity can support management of this use finally the study demonstrates that groundwater management decisions such as reducing groundwater pumping or managed aquifer recharge can have immediate measurable impacts on aquifer storage and that these impacts can be monitored effectively from the land

7674,study region the groundwater basin underlying the city of albuquerque new mexico usa study focus the study focuses on changes in groundwater storage and how those changes relate to groundwater level changes groundwater storage change was measured using repeat microgravity at 35 stations from 2016 to 2021 usually storage is monitored by converting groundwater level changes to storage changes using the aquifer storage coefficient a difficult property to measure with gravity storage change can be measured directly the storage coefficient or specific yield in an unconfined aquifer was estimated using the gravity method at individual sites and a map created showing how this property varies over the region new hydrological insights for the region for the first time a map of specific yield was produced based on interpolated maps of gravity derived storage change and groundwater level change allowing inference of this property over a broad region even without collocated monitoring wells and gravity stations gravity data indicate aquifer drawdown and recovery mainly occurs in the central part of the basin where pumping is greatest this spatial distribution is not captured by the more widely spaced monitoring well network because the aquifer is recovering from historically greater magnitude pumping net neutral storage change inflow outflow occurs when pumping from the central part of the well field is about 1 54 107 cubic meters 12 500 acre feet per year graphical abstract beginning in 2009 the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority reduced groundwater

underground storage of water intentionally recharged through infiltration and injection known as managed aquifer recharge dillon 2005 zhang et al 2020 understanding the timing and location of water storage changes within an aquifer in response to managed aquifer recharge and pumping specifically using the repeat microgravity method aids in monitoring the effects of groundwater management decisions carruth et al 2018 kennedy et al 2019a 2019b determining if water is stored and removed from confined or unconfined storage chen et al 2018 modeling transient groundwater flow christiansen et al 2011 kennedy et al 2021b and determining specific yield pool and eychaner 1995 chen et al 2021 basic monitoring of the aquifer storage change associated with managed recharge and groundwater pumping is usually limited to measuring groundwater levels in a few wells in many cases the amount of water recharged is simply assumed to be available for later withdrawal by pumping sometimes with a nominal reduction to account for the inability to completely withdraw the recharged water megdal et al 2014 installing monitoring wells may be prohibitive owing to cost and local conditions e g contamination large depth to water etc even where groundwater level data are collected an estimate of the aquifer storage coefficient specific yield is required to convert groundwater level change to storage change but specific yield is often unknown without accurate knowledge of specific yield and understanding of confined or unconfined aquifer conditions groundwater level based estimates of basin scale aquifer storage change e g rinehart et al 2016 have substantial uncertainty in addition to allowing the conversion between groundwater level and storage change specific yield is a key parameter important for simulating transient groundwater flow liu et al 2022 and for land surface models lv et al 2021 estimating specific yield is difficult at the field scale i e a scale larger than point laboratory scale measurements pumping tests can provide results for a limited area centered on the pumping well neuman 1987 but there may be a time dependence on estimates that are not compatible with the seasonal to annual time scales relevant for groundwater flow modeling crosbie et al 2019 geophysical approaches to estimating specific yield have included electromagnetic methods frohlich and kelly 1988 tizro et al 2012 and magnetic resonance sounding vouillamoz et al 2012 an inherent limitation of geophysical methods is the requirement for a petrophysical model with its accompanying parameters and uncertainty to convert the measured property e g electrical resistivity to the property of interest e g water content another approach is to estimate specific yield as a parameter during groundwater flow model calibration using either traditional parameter estimation methods malama et al 2016 or hydraulic tomographic methods whereby wells are pumped at different depth intervals liu et al 2020 specific yield can also be estimated using the water table fluctuation method whereby groundwater level changes are measured relative to a known volume of storage change the volume of storage change can be estimated from recharge flux e g using the chloride mass balance method crosbie et al 2019 from known pumping volumes liu et al 2022 or measured using the repeat microgravity method pool and eychaner 1995 blainey et al 2007 in addition to estimating specific yield monitoring storage changes in multi layer aquifer systems is useful for determining the presence or absence of unconfined storage the storage mechanism is important because changes in the water volume stored in confined aquifers generally cause subsidence or uplift and overpumping can lead to irreversible storage capacity loss dahlke et al 2018 on the other hand unconfined water storage changes which occur at the water table are in generally coarser sediments that are less susceptible to over pumping but unconfined water storage change can be problematic because these aquifers are more susceptible to contamination and because excess storage increases can raise the water table above the land surface or mobilize contaminants in the unsaturated zone confined aquifer storage coefficients are generally much smaller than in unconfined aquifers because water is released from storage by decompression of the water and aquifer material as compared to the relatively high storage coefficients specific yield in unconfined aquifers where water is released or stored by draining or saturating pore space at the water table large storage changes determined from gravity measurements that are correlated with groundwater level changes indicate the presence of unconfined storage change possibly in addition to confined storage change whereas small storage changes during periods of large groundwater level change indicate confined conditions pool 2008 the timing between groundwater levels and storage change can also be used to investigate delayed storage changes neuman 1972 gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2021 a process by which water is not released or stored instantaneously following a groundwater level change due to capillary pressure retaining water during drainage or air entrapment below a rising water table repeat microgravity provides a direct noninvasive method for measuring groundwater storage change which in turn is effective for estimating specific yield using the horizontal infinite slab approximation 1 m of free standing water is equivalent to a 41 9 µgal gravity change changes in the acceleration due to gravity measured using sensitive gravimeters are linearly related to changes in groundwater storage regardless of depth to water or aquifer porosity the method has been used extensively to map storage changes from the land surface e g gehman et al 2009 kennedy et al 2016 carruth et al 2018 and from space scanlon et al 2015 rateb et al 2020 but there are very few basin scale terrestrial gravity networks with accompanying monitoring well networks e g carruth et al 2018 we extend the traditional site specific method of estimating specific yield pool and eychaner 1995 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2021 to a map based application where instead of point measurements of specific yield a map of storage change interpolated from point repeat microgravity measurements is compared to a map of groundwater level change also interpolated from point measurements this is the first known investigation to combine extensive repeat microgravity data groundwater level monitoring and high resolution data on high volume groundwater pumping to understand storage change and determine specific yield across a basin furthermore the extensive use of absolute gravity measurements in conjunction with modern low drift relative gravimeters provides better accuracy than previous gravity mapping efforts that have typically used relative gravimeters alone in this paper we demonstrate the application of a network of repeat microgravity stations and groundwater monitoring wells to monitor the effect of groundwater management decisions that is the choice of when and where to pump and recharge groundwater on the timing and location of groundwater storage change and the implications for confined vs unconfined storage change from these data specific yield is estimated at individual sites where a relation exists between groundwater level and gravity derived storage change unique to this study sufficient data exist to interpolate independent surfaces of storage change and groundwater level change at the basin kilometers scale from this an interpolated surface of specific yield is calculated finally the relation between the volume of storage change and volume of groundwater pumped is examined and used to estimate net inflow within a control volume 2 study area the study area is in the city of albuquerque new mexico and surrounding bernalillo county an area that relies on a combination of surface water and groundwater for public water supply beginning in late 2008 with the completion of the san juan chama drinking water project water treatment facilities in albuquerque the albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority water authority incorporated additional surface water supply and so consequently reduced their groundwater pumping beginning a decade long period of increasing groundwater storage that is inflow to the aquifer was greater than outflow in the central well field where a large cone of depression had developed galanter and curry 2019 to monitor groundwater storage change associated with this shift in water supply the existing monitoring well network was augmented with a repeat gravity network in 2016 the study area comprises an extensive basin fill aquifer in oligocene to pliocene santa fe group sediments lozinsky 1994 the central part of the study area is heavily urbanized whereas little development has occurred in outlying areas climate is temperate with average monthly temperatures ranging from 13 c january to 25 c july and average 1990 2020 rainfall ranging from less than 25 cm at the basin floor to greater than 60 cm some as snow at higher elevations in the sandia mountains prism climate group 2022 most surface runoff from storms is conveyed by large concrete lined channels towards the north south trending rio grande the only significant perennial stream reach in the study area the study focuses on a 10 km east west by 20 km north south area between the rio grande to the west elevation ca 1500 m above sea level and the sandia mountains 3255 m to the east and between kirtland air force base and paseo del norte blvd to the south and north respectively fig 1 an extensive productive aquifer underlies this area in the cenozoic sierra ladrones formation of the santa fe group and the more recent basin and valley fill deposits which are composed primarily of interbedded gravel sand silt and clay fluvial and basin fill sediments fig 2 the sierra ladrones formation and the recent deposits are hydraulically connected and termed the santa fe group aquifer system bartolino and cole 2002 localized confining layers exist in the aquifer but the study area is generally characterized as a fully saturated multilayer aquifer with an uppermost unconfined layer heywood 1997 groundwater flow in this area is generally unaffected by major faults plummer et al 2003 however analysis of land subsidence data for albuquerque indicates that faults in specific areas may act as barriers to lateral groundwater flow driscoll and brandt 2017 specific yield in the basin has been estimated to be 0 20 based on groundwater modeling studies kernodle et al 1995 mcada and barroll 2002 and this value has been used in previous investigations to convert groundwater level change to storage change rinehart et al 2016 historically the albuquerque region has relied on groundwater for municipal and industrial needs with surface water used for irrigation primarily near the rio grande the water authority pumps water from 17 well fields comprising about 60 wells throughout the region fig 1 ritchie and pepin 2020 with additional pumping by other entities as of water year 2000 the water authority accounted for about 77 of the pumping in the entire study area fig 1 and 90 of the pumping east of interstate 25 mcada and barroll 2002 beginning in late 2008 water authority groundwater withdrawals were reduced and augmented with surface water from the san juan chama drinking water project abcwua 2022 water authority groundwater withdrawals pumpage decreased from an average of about 121 106 m3 1 106 m3 811 acre feet per year for the 2003 2008 period to about 58 106 m3 for the 2016 2021 period galanter and curry 2019 abcwua 2022 resulting in widespread recovery of groundwater levels fig 3 pumpage increased in 2020 2021 to meet demand during a period of decreased rio grande flows pumping is typically from the deeper parts of the aquifer 200 400 m below land surface with production wells screened at or below the water table wells were initially screened about 30 m and deeper below the water table but drawdown has caused the water table to intersect the screened intervals at some locations the largest amount of non water authority pumping about 16 0 106 m3 yr is in rio rancho about 15 km northwest of the study area and west of the rio grande stroud and kilmer 2016 and in the southern part of the study area on kirtland air force base kirtland pumpage was 3 6 106 m3 in 2020 mean annual pumpage was less at 1 0 0 07 106 m3 for the 2010 2020 period sandia national laboratories 2021 the amount of other pumpage from private wells is largely unknown there are thousands of individual domestic wells in the western part of the study area stroud and kilmer 2016 recharge in the study area is primarily mountain block recharge from the sandia mountains to the east streambed infiltration from the rio grande and recharge facilities total inflow and outflow for the groundwater basin an area larger than the study area for the year 1999 was estimated to be about 634 106 m3 and 709 106 m3 respectively with the balance 75 106 m3 removed from storage mcada and barroll 2002 because of high amounts of impervious area and high evapotranspiration direct land surface recharge is likely small although some recharge likely occurs from septic systems water distribution system leaks and irrigated areas myers and friesz 2019 a cone of depression from pumping exists between the rio grande and the sandia mountains inducing recharge from both sources fig 1 west of a north south line between stations sici and fox fig 1 recharge is primarily from the rio grande east of this line recharge is primarily mountain front recharge from the east plummer et al 2003 the water authority recharges water through an injection well screened 122 366 m below land surface site asr1 also named wtf1 in kennedy and bell 2023 and at the bear canyon in channel recharge project where water infiltrates into a dry arroyo streambed 3 methods this study relies primarily on groundwater level data collected at monitoring wells and piezometers in the study area and repeat microgravity data the albuquerque groundwater level monitoring network includes hourly observations at about 47 wells and piezometers at 15 locations and annual or semi annual observations at 90 100 wells ritchie and pepin 2020 many locations have 3 or more piezometers open at different levels in the aquifer which are useful for evaluating vertical gradients that have the potential to cause upward or downward groundwater flow groundwater level data are available in the u s geological survey usgs national water information system u s geological survey 2022 and are published in usgs data reports e g jurney and bell 2021 and as water level change maps e g galanter and curry 2019 a repeat microgravity network consisting of up to 35 locations was established in 2016 and visited three times per year surveys used a combination of zls corporation burris relative gravity meters and a micro g lacoste inc a 10 absolute gravity meter following the methods described in kennedy et al 2021a although global positioning system data were collected during each absolute gravity measurement about 30 min per occupation no land surface elevation changes were observed that were larger than the uncertainty provided by opus rs processing online positioning user service rapid static national geodetic survey 2022 extensometer and interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar data indicate 1 cm or less overall vertical displacement since 2000 with maximum annual fluctuations of 0 003 0 004 m related to groundwater pumping driscoll and brandt 2017 given the small gravity effect this displacement causes 0 003 m land surface elevation change is about 1 µgal of gravity change and the lack of comprehensive elevation change data during the study period gravity data were not corrected for elevation change absolute and relative gravity data were combined using least squares network adjustment implemented in gsadjust software kennedy 2020 which provides a best fit gravity value at each station for each survey while accounting for measurement uncertainty input data for the network adjustment are observed absolute gravity values transferred to the relative gravity meter height using the measured vertical gravity gradient at each site and relative gravity differences between stations relative gravity meter drift was estimated by visiting each relative gravity station at least twice during a survey and corrected using the roman time interpolation method roman 1946 a relative gravity meter calibration coefficient was calculated for each survey by including it as a parameter in the least squares adjustment for each survey the chi square goodness of fit statistic was evaluated and the relative gravity difference standard deviations were scaled such that the network reference factor was equal to 1 the gravity station naming convention is lowercase for relative gravity only stations and uppercase for stations that also or only include absolute gravity measurements gravity change between surveys was converted to storage change using the horizontal infinite slab approximation 1 t g 41 9 where δg is the gravity change between any two surveys in microgal and δt is the estimated change in storage in units of meters of free standing water pool and eychaner 1995 notably this relation does not depend on the depth to water that is the same relation holds for shallow and deep water tables nor aquifer specific yield gravity data were not corrected for near surface soil moisture changes in urbanized areas such as the study area land surface infiltration is minimized by extensive impervious area some stations are in parks typically between a parking lot and irrigated turf area although soil moisture may be high in the irrigated areas the gravity signal is only sensitive to changes in soil moisture which are minimized by regular irrigation nonetheless irrigation may contribute to the seasonal signal apparent at some stations maps showing storage change and groundwater level change were generated by ordinary no underlying trend kriging interpolation matheron 1963 as implemented in gstools müeller et al 2022 for each successive period between gravity surveys year to year change for each season and cumulative change over longer periods the semivariogram range 12 500 m or distance at which correlation reaches its minimum was taken from previously developed semivariograms for the study area ritchie and pepin 2020 the spherical semivariogram for storage change fit to observed gravity changes between all time periods had a nugget correlation at 0 distance and sill equal to 0 0091 equivalent to a 4 µgal standard deviation of the gravity change between surveys the spherical semivariogram for groundwater level change had a nugget of 0 0001 equivalent to a 0 014 m standard deviation between water level measurements and a sill of 0 02 spatial patterns in the kriged surfaces were driven primarily by the data values and were relatively insensitive to semivariogram parameters for the purpose of interpolation all 22 gravity stations in the eastern part of the study area were included but results are clipped to a control volume polygon kriging interpolation provides an estimate of uncertainty at each location as a function of the nugget variance at zero distance and sill variance at the specified range kriged variance is a function of these parameters and the distance from measurement locations for this study the gravity data have greater measurement uncertainty but interpolation distances are generally less whereas the groundwater level data have lower measurement uncertainty but distances between wells are greater to estimate uncertainty of the specific yield surface the kriged variance of the individual storage and groundwater level change surfaces must be combined combining the variance as percent uncertainty x standard deviation x is impractical as the values are often near zero which leads to undefined percent uncertainty therefore the kriged variance of the gravity and groundwater level surfaces was combined directly 2 σ sy σ s 2 σ gwl 2 2 where σ s 2 is the kriged storage change variance in units of meters of water and σ gwl 2 is the kriged groundwater level change variance in units of meters site specific specific yield analyses were carried out by plotting the relation between storage change and groundwater level change specific yield is equal to the slope of the best fit line determined from linear regression at each location groundwater levels were taken from the piezometer with the shallowest screened interval representing the uppermost unconfined aquifer the effect of delayed storage change was evaluated by testing different lag intervals to maximize the r2 of the storage change groundwater level change relation one dimensional gravity derived storage change during the approximate four month period between each gravity survey was converted to a volume of water by summing the kriged survey to survey change within a polygon control volume encompassing the gravity stations and pumping wells in the east central well field total pumping during this period was calculated by summing the average monthly pumpage for the preceding four month period only monthly pumping data were available for the analysis monthly well pumping for each well was provided by the water authority katherine yuhas albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority unpublished data 2022 4 results 4 1 timing and location of storage changes for each gravity survey about 90 relative gravity differences and 8 absolute gravity values were observed over a period of two weeks or less the mean absolute relative gravity residual difference between observed and adjusted gravity differences for all surveys was 5 2 1 2 µgal 1 standard deviation the average absolute gravity residual was 5 6 3 4 µgal mean standard deviation of the adjusted gravity values at each station ranged from 2 0 to 6 0 µgal additional details about the gravity data processing are in the accompanying data release kennedy and bell 2023 long term groundwater level records fig 3 show the effect of reduced pumping beginning in late 2008 pumping by the water authority reduced from about 113 106 m3 in 2008 to 71 5 102008 71 5 106 m3 in 2010 groundwater levels recovered across the basin despite ongoing groundwater withdrawals of about 34 5 67 8 106 m3 per year until 2020 when increased groundwater pumping was required to meet municipal needs water levels across the basin generally decreased in 2020 and 2021 relative to their highest point in late 2019 groundwater storage trends from repeat microgravity data generally agree with groundwater level changes fig 3 changes are largest at stations near the historic cone of depression hoff mesa and smaller at more distant stations nest the general trend of increasing groundwater levels and storage followed by decreasing groundwater levels and storage however is consistent at every station east of the rio grande in addition to long term trends groundwater levels show a seasonal pattern related to increased water demand in summertime fig 3 but these are less visible in the three times per year gravity data at some locations such as jcli and sici groundwater levels can decrease by a meter or more almost instantaneously after summertime pumping begins at these locations this causes the vertical gradient to reverse from potential upward flow during non pumping or lightly pumping periods to potential downward flow during the periods of heaviest pumping based on head measured in piezometers screened at different depths in the aquifer fig 4 this results in unconfined storage change at the water table being delayed relative to pumping as the head change propagates through the aquifer and provides evidence that groundwater pumped from deeper parts of the aquifer is connected to groundwater in unconfined storage at the top of the aquifer although vertical movement of groundwater may be limited locally by the presence of discontinuous confining units travis and myers 2019 storage change can be calculated between any two surveys between successive surveys between annual surveys at the same time of year or over longer periods fig 5 relative to the volume of groundwater pumped open circles in fig 5 the gravity data better capture the spatial extent of pumping related storage change in part this is simply because there are more gravity stations at closer spacing than there are wells notably the albuquerque groundwater level monitoring network is one of the most extensive in the southwestern us established at significant cost over several years in comparison the gravity network was established over a few weeks at little cost other than personnel time to investigate potential measurement locations for the 2019 04 to 2019 08 period fig 5a a seasonal decrease in storage is visible in the central part of the well field southwestern part of the control volume during this warm season period of heavier groundwater pumping for irrigation the rest of the area shows the continuing increase in storage from the long term trend beginning around 2010 fig 3 groundwater levels are at their highest point during the study in 2019 and show little change during this period for the 2018 12 to 2019 12 period fig 5b groundwater level increases were nearly the same at each monitoring well location whereas increases in storage occurred primarily in the area where pumping wells are concentrated as the cone of depression from historical pumping continued to recover during this period the effect is to overestimate the increase in storage if only groundwater level data were used most of the east half of the interpolated groundwater level change is determined by three locations no wells are present to the southeast where storage decrease occurs during this period at the northernmost well gravity station usgs site no 351114106330603 nest and easternmost well usgs site no 350653106311602 math storage change is slightly negative and groundwater level change is slightly positive fig 3 possibly reflecting delayed drainage effects of seasonal groundwater pumping but also measurement noise although repeat gravity measurements have relatively high uncertainty they may better represent the state of the groundwater system at one particular time because storage changes occur slowly on the other hand groundwater levels in the study area can change rapidly which creates uncertainty in the exact time interval that should be considered when interpreting groundwater levels to determine storage change e g should exact 1 year intervals be used or the water level immediately prior to the onset of spring pumping regardless of the exact date for the 2019 04 to 2021 04 period fig 5c annual pumping was greater than during the previous 10 year period the gravity measured storage change shows substantial decreases in storage relative to the groundwater level changes which are minimal this period includes the 2020 pumping season during which storage and groundwater levels declined substantially during winter 2020 2021 groundwater levels rebounded to nearly their 2019 level but without an accompanying increase in storage during this period the two data types represent different parts of the aquifer head in the deeper parts of the aquifer is represented by groundwater levels and storage at the water table the shallower unconfined aquifer is represented by the repeat microgravity data calculating the change in groundwater storage from groundwater level change alone would underestimate the decrease in storage for the 2017 08 to 2021 08 period the longest period during which all stations were surveyed an increase in groundwater storage the result of the long term trend in storage beginning in 2010 augmented by managed aquifer recharge is present in the northwest and northeast parts of the control volume and decreases exist in the central and southern parts fig 5d these are somewhat mirrored by groundwater level changes although the monitoring well network is unable to capture the storage increases from managed recharge and the decrease in water levels overestimates storage change because values are interpolated across broad areas with no data storage increases can be seen locally at two locations where the water authority recharges water the surface water treatment facility asr1 and bear canyon at the former 1 62 106 m3 of water have been recharged from 2019 through 2021 abcwua 2022 gravity increases related to this recharge at station asr1 fig 3 and fig 5 are only visible in the last two surveys in 2021 the spatial extent of this recharge is difficult to determine from the present microgravity network but it is not apparent at any of the adjacent stations the relatively large magnitude of this increase about 35 µgal indicates at least some of the injected water is stored at the water table and or has displaced water at the water table if the increase was only in confined storage the expected gravity change would be much smaller however the limited spatial extent of recharged water likely indicates the assumptions of the horizontal infinite slab approximation are not satisfied and the equivalent volume of free standing water is less than that relation 41 9 µgal 1 m of water would indicate storage change at bear canyon miller et al 2021 generally increases in the downstream direction west from the outfall where water is artificially discharged fig 6 the increase was maximum 104 108 µgal at the two stations in the center of the reach bcn1 and bcn4 250 m and 400 m downstream respectively the increase in storage was delayed but more sustained at station bcn2 about 100 m away from the channel and bcn6 about 200 m away from the channel than at the other stations which are adjacent to the channel the smaller increase in storage in 2020 2021 is likely caused by the smaller amount of water delivered and by the timing about 0 70 106 m3 were recharged in winter 2018 2019 and about 0 25 106 m3 were recharged in winter 2020 2021 kelsey bicknell albuquerque bernalillo county water utility authority unpublished data 2022 fig 6 recharge in 2018 2019 occurred near the end of the 10 year period of storage increase caused by reduced pumping whereas 2020 2021 recharge occurred at the end of several months of increased pumping fig 3 the decrease in storage between recharge cycles and the absence of an accumulated increase in groundwater storage indicates the facility is working as intended water must move away from the facility after each recharge cycle to accommodate the next cycle recharge at bear canyon has resulted in relatively local increases in groundwater storage the largest changes were excluded from kriging interpolation of the regional surface fig 5 and fig 8 because of their influence however the influence of bear canyon recharge is visible in surrounding stations such as station star 1 3 km south southeast from the facility fig 6 because of the three dimensional shallow nature of storage change at bear canyon the horizontal infinite slab approximation is likely not appropriate and the gravity data must be interpreted through hydrologic modeling to fully investigate the extent and magnitude of storage changes e g kennedy et al 2016 4 2 specific yield site specific specific yield estimates were obtained at eight sites table 1 and fig 7 at three of the four sites shown in fig 7 specific yield is estimated to be 0 21 0 22 at the fourth site math specific yield is somewhat less about 0 10 this site is further east than the others away from the deepest part of the historic cone of depression together these results agree well with the map based estimate of specific yield described later at two of the 10 sites where specific yield analysis was carried out hrun and wght table 1 the estimated specific yield was negative because the overall trend at these sites was decreasing storage accompanied by increasing or steady groundwater levels these two sites and two others with uncertain specific yield estimates svis nest are relatively far from nearby pumping and do not exhibit the same increase followed by decrease storage and groundwater level trends seen at most of the other sites also the magnitude of groundwater level change is relatively small about 0 5 m at hrun and 0 3 m at wght resulting in more uncertainty in the regression analysis these specific yield estimates apply to the vertical interval of the aquifer where the water table occurs at each monitoring well the map based approach to estimating specific yield from interpolated surfaces of storage change and gravity change involves simply dividing the interpolated storage change in each grid cell by the interpolated groundwater level change it has the advantages of providing a specific yield estimate at every point as is required for groundwater modeling and it reduces the requirement for collocated gravity stations and monitoring wells the approach is most effective where the gravity and groundwater networks have relatively high station density to maximize the magnitude of storage change used in the specific yield analysis and therefore the accuracy of the estimate the dec 2017 to dec 2019 period was analyzed fig 8 only the control volume area fig 5 where data density is highest was considered both storage and groundwater levels increased uniformly across the control volume during this period with the greatest increases for both data types in the central area and to the southwest the resultant specific yield field is smoothly varying with minimal bullseye artifacts from the spatial interpolation the interpolated specific yield ranges from 0 05 to 0 4 confirming the presence of storage changes occurring in the uppermost unconfined aquifer throughout the area uncertainty standard deviation in the interpolated specific yield calculated using eq 2 ranges from 0 082 to 0 115 with a mean value of 0 098 the gravity groundwater relation provides evidence for delayed storage change relative to groundwater level data first the rapid declines in groundwater level most evident during early summer 2020 fig 3 are not accompanied by rapid decreases in storage instead a gradual decline in storage begins in 2020 second estimates of specific yield are improved when gravity data are lagged behind groundwater level data for the comparison that is the representative interval for the groundwater level change is some days before the interval of the corresponding gravity change during drainage this effect is caused by water retained in the unsaturated zone by capillary pressure and during imbibition rising water table it is caused by air entrapment the optimal lag interval ranged from 2 to 57 days with a median value of 16 days table 1 although this provides only a rough estimate of the delayed yield effect the effect was consistent in direction r2 always decreased when groundwater level change was lagged behind storage change and relatively uniform in magnitude the delay between pumping and storage change could be better resolved with continuous e g hourly gravity data as is possible with stationary instruments such as superconducting gravity meters and temperature stabilized relative meters 4 3 correlation between pumping gravity change and water level change gravity derived storage change is well correlated with groundwater pumping within the control volume r2 0 81 fig 9 two periods were excluded from the regression the 2016 12 to 2017 05 period which was before the full gravity network was established and data are sparse and the 2019 08 to 2019 12 period for which gravity data indicated large decreases in storage in the far southeast part of the network the reason for this large decrease is unknown but it may be related to unknown error in the relative gravity data or by pumping outside the control volume area where data are sparse uncertainty standard deviation for the storage change estimates was determined by summing the variance estimate for each cell provided by kriging and taking the square root standard deviation of the storage change estimates 0 10 106 to 0 14 106 cubic meters was small relative to the magnitude of the estimates 12 5 106 to 21 4 106 cubic meters this method of calculating uncertainty summing in quadrature assumes error in each kriged cell is independent and may underestimate the actual uncertainty if there is bias in the kriged surface several conclusions can be drawn from the storage change vs pumping relation fig 9 first storage change ranges from 12 5 to 21 4 106 m3 despite positive net pumping during each 120 day period this indicates substantial recharge is entering the control volume although the source of the recharge river seepage mountain block front recharge or land surface recharge cannot be determined from this study previous studies using geochemical tracers indicate the western part of the fig 5 control volume receives recharge from the rio grande the eastern part from the sandia mountains and land surface recharge is minimal plummer et al 2003 travis et al 2021 the magnitude of recharge entering the control volume is about 15 4 106 m3 per 120 day period the x intercept of the regression line in fig 9 pumping above this amount results in a decrease in aquifer storage in this area whereas pumping below this amount results in an increase this relation is likely affected by the history of pumping in the area which causes increased recharge than would otherwise occur as the depressed potentiometric surface associated with the historic cone of depression recovers without historic pumping in this area recharge into the control volume would likely be less and the change in storage would be zero at steady state the slope of the best fit line 1 78 0 26 is significantly different than 1 suggesting that storage change is likely affected by other non water authority pumping in the area in other words as the water authority increases their pumping other entities also pump greater amounts expanding the control volume to encompass more distant pumping would decrease the accuracy of the storage change estimate because it requires extrapolation of storage change data over long distances from the observation locations to create the interpolated kriged surface 5 discussion this study builds on previous efforts to estimate specific yield where gravity stations are collocated with monitoring wells e g pool and eychaner 1995 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2021 unlike previous efforts we present a map showing specific yield across a region rather than site specific estimates restricted to monitoring well locations gravity stations can be located nearly anywhere on the land surface whereas wells are in fixed pre existing locations as long as sufficient groundwater level data exist to interpolate a map of water level change and storage change is sufficiently large to generate a gravity signal the method we present can efficiently generate a map of specific yield for any particular region furthermore the continuous daily groundwater level data available for this study allowed investigation of the time lag between water level change and storage change previous efforts relied on groundwater level data collected on the same day as gravity data validating the specific yield estimates is difficult because specific yield can vary depending on the method volume of subsurface analyzed and duration of the testing neuman 1987 lv et al 2021 differences between the site specific specific yield estimate fig 7 and the kriged estimate fig 8 although small are primarily a function of the semivariogram nugget i e the weight placed on the observed values in the kriging interpolation and could be made smaller or larger depending on the choice of nugget although specific yield estimates may have been obtained from pumping tests when production wells were first installed these exist only in consultant s reports and are not readily available published aquifer property values are primarily specific capacity and hydraulic conductivity e g connell et al 1998 and previous modeling efforts heywood 1997 myers and friesz 2019 assumed a constant specific yield value of 0 20 and 0 12 respectively because more localized data were unavailable the storage change results in particular the relation between gravity determined storage change and independently measured groundwater pumping demonstrate the benefit of repeat microgravity storage change monitoring for estimating basin scale recharge a fundamental challenge for calculating water budgets devlin and sophocleous 2005 and groundwater modeling sanford 2002 scanlon et al 2002 without direct measurement of storage change recharge must be estimated as the balance of other fluxes entering or exiting the region or from precipitation and climate data for this study the volume of municipal pumping is well known but other fluxes non municipal pumping land surface and incidental recharge mountain block recharge rio grande seepage evapotranspiration are poorly constrained by measuring storage change directly the balance of these fluxes inflow minus outflow can be estimated without needing precise estimates of each direct measurement also eliminates the need to convert groundwater level changes to storage change for reporting and regulatory purposes e g rinehart et al 2016 the connection between the uppermost unconfined aquifer and deeper aquifers where pumping wells are screened indicated by the correlation between storage and pumping has implications for water quality significant groundwater contamination exists in the southern part of the study area travis et al 2021 in the upper part of the aquifer i e within the unconfined aquifer where storage changes occur as shown here and by travis and myers 2019 pumping from deeper parts of the aquifer can reverse the normally upward gradient and may create the potential for groundwater to flow downward toward pumping well screens this could result in transport of contaminants to deeper parts of the aquifer where it can enter the drinking water supply depending on the presence and integrity of confining units 6 conclusion repeat microgravity and groundwater level monitoring were used to estimate the effect of groundwater management decisions on aquifer storage change and to estimate specific yield in the albuquerque new mexico region both data sets capture the increase in groundwater storage from 2016 to 2019 caused by reduced groundwater pumping and the subsequent decrease in 2020 2021 caused by increased pumping specific yield was determined from site specific analyses at collocated gravity stations and wells and by interpolating storage change and groundwater level change surfaces site specific specific yield ranged from 0 04 to 0 39 and estimates were in good agreement with the interpolation approach using kriged surfaces of storage change and groundwater level change relatively large storage changes correlated with groundwater level changes indicate water is being removed from unconfined storage although there is likely a days to weeks delay between changes in pumping which takes place primarily at deeper levels in the aquifer and changes in storage at the water table as head changes propagate through the multilayer aquifer the relation between storage change and groundwater level change provides evidence for delayed drainage following the onset of pumping gonzález quirós and fernández álvarez 2021 storage change is correlated with groundwater pumping volume reported by the water authority but the slope of the regression storage change 1 78 pumping indicates additional pumping other than from those wells considered in the control volume approach likely contributes to the change in storage within the control volume repeat microgravity like all methods has limitations foremost the method depends on an adequate signal to noise ratio absent municipal scale pumping or artificial recharge aquifer storage changes are often below the detection limit e g kennedy et al 2018 noise can be relatively high for repeat microgravity measurements especially relative to the centimeter accuracy provided by groundwater level measurements noise comes from the instruments themselves schmerge and francis 2006 from seismic vibration of the land surface and from other unaccounted processes that influence gravity such as soil moisture change atmospheric pressure changes and ocean loading together these noise factors limit the precision of measurements of aquifer storage change to 3 5 µgal at best or 0 07 0 12 m of free standing water other limitations are the cost of instrumentation up to several hundred thousand us dollars and the speed with which surveys can be carried out a network of 100 stations is about the upper practical limit for the number that can be observed in a single snapshot of the aquifer the present study and future ones could be improved by increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of the data gravity data collected three times per year provide only a general level understanding of the aquifer hourly measurements made using stationary instruments could be particularly effective in the study area for real time monitoring and better understanding the time delay between pumping and storage change this study has several implications beyond the immediate study area first it demonstrates that high precision repeat microgravity data can be effectively and efficiently collected over a large region over a period of several years because of improved instrumentation and processing techniques kennedy 2020 kennedy et al 2021a these data can be incorporated in a routine monitoring program and also applied to advanced aquifer characterization through hydraulic tomography tsai et al 2017 second the unconsolidated basin fill deposits in the albuquerque area with an uppermost unconfined aquifer and interbedded fluvial and piedmont deposits are typical of basin fill deposits throughout the southwestern united states and the world aquifers in these deposits are used extensively for public water supply and this use will increase under future population growth and increasing managed aquifer recharge cost effective non invasive monitoring provided by repeat microgravity can support management of this use finally the study demonstrates that groundwater management decisions such as reducing groundwater pumping or managed aquifer recharge can have immediate measurable impacts on aquifer storage and that these impacts can be monitored effectively from the land
