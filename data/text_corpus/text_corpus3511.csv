17555,filamentous fungi are believed to remove a wide range of environmental xenobiotics due to their characteristically non specific catabolic metabolisms nonetheless irregular hyphal spreading can lead to clogging problems in treatment facilities and the dependence of pollutant bioavailability on hyphal surface features severely limits their applicability in water treatment here we propose a scalable and facile methodology to structurally modify fungal hyphae allowing for both the maximization of pollutant sorption and fungal pellet morphology self regulation halloysite doped mycelium architectures were efficiently constructed by dipping aspergillus fumigatus pellets in halloysite nanotube dispersed water ultrastructure analyses using scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy revealed that the nanotubes were mainly attached to the outer surface of the pellets fungal viability and exoenzyme production were hardly affected by the halloysites notably nanotube doping appeared to be extremely robust given that detachments rarely occurred even in high concentrations of organic solvents and salt it was also demonstrated that the doped halloysites weakened hyphal growth driven gelation thus maintaining sphere like pellet structures the water treatment potential of the hybrid fungal mycelia was assessed through both cationic toxic organic inorganic contaminated water and real dye industry wastewater clean ups aided by the mesoporous halloysite sites on their surface the removal abilities of the hybrid structures were significantly enhanced moreover inherent low sorption ability of hnt for heavy metals was found to be overcome by the aid of fungal mycelia finally universal feature of the dipping based doping way was confirmed by using different filamentous fungi given that traditional approaches to effectively implement fungus based water treatment are based mostly on polymer based immobilization techniques our proposed approach provides a novel and effective alternative via simple doping of living fungi with environmentally benign clays such as halloysite nanotubes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous fungi halloysite nanotubes water treatment hybrid materials doping 1 introduction bacteria employ highly specialized enzymes and specific degradative pathways such specific reactions are beneficial to channel specific carbon substrates into central catabolic pathways however bacteria tend to be inefficient when oxidizing xenobiotics with unfamiliar structures bacteria may also utilize xenobiotics as a growth substrate for cell proliferation but their degradation efficiency decreases when the pollutant concentration is insufficient to promote bacterial growth fischer and majewsky 2014 harms et al 2011 several micropollutants including antibiotics and endocrine disrupting chemicals are thus not removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants luo et al 2014 instead fungal metabolism has been highlighted to overcome known drawbacks of bacterium based biodegradation alamo et al 2020 mir tutusaus et al 2018 because they are widely known to perform catabolic reactions that are distinct from those of bacteria particularly organic matter including xenobiotics degradation pathways in fungi are generally based on non specific reactive oxygen species ros mediated oxidation and small organic mediator system harms et al 2011 fungal exoenzymes such as laccases and peroxidases are linked to the production of ross which are able to non specifically oxidize a wide range of organic structures wei et al 2010 harms et al 2011 small and diffusible organic mediators derived from natural polymers such as lignin are also involved in higher redox potential and more non specific oxidations than those of fungal enzymes canas and camarero 2010 despite the advantages of fungal catabolism the use of fungi is rarely recommended to remediate pollutant contaminated sites including water treatment harms et al 2011 fungi generally exhibit filamentous features with lengths reaching up to hundreds of meters ritz and young 2004 these characteristics enable long range transport of pollutants banitz et al 2013 however mechanical disturbances may disrupt mycelia growth and dispersed mycelia development may also lead to operational problems in water treatment facilities such as clogging inferior mixing and low oxygen supply moreover wastewater flow in treatment facilities tends to result in a steady loss of fungal biomass and bacterial contamination thereby requiring regular fungal re inoculations mir tutusaus et al 2018 to overcome these challenges several studies have attempted to harness fungal immobilization polymers including alginate polypropylene polyurethane and waste plant biomass sampedro et al 2009 daassi et al 2013 alamo et al 2020 these strategies appear to be effective in maintaining fungal biomass and removing recalcitrant pollutants but are not exempt from some critical disadvantages notably fungal ros based reactions can indiscriminately degrade the immobilization polymers thereby leading to long term performance deterioration in fact some fungi have been reported to oxidize several kinds of plastics and even recalcitrant polymers including asphalt gautam et al 2007 yanto and tachibana et al 2014 moreover xenobiotic removal efficacy depends on the mycelia surface area and characteristics young and banks 1998 bayramoglu and arica 2008 in this context immobilization techniques diminish fungal surface areas because some of them are required to bind to the immobilizing materials themselves it has also been demonstrated that the catalytic activities of immobilized fungal extracellular enzymes are lower than those of free enzymes le et al 2016 given that the relatively dense matrices of the immobilizing polymers limited the free diffusion of xenobiotics into the enzymatic active sites therefore a new strategy is urgently required to overcome the current limitations of immobilization techniques while still maintaining their known advantages halloysite nanotubes hnts are naturally occurring mesoporous clay minerals with large surface areas and sorption capacities and could therefore be used as versatile agents for organic and inorganic material sorption yu et al 2016 these clay based nanomaterials are abundantly available cheap durable and nontoxic and therefore diverse applications for these materials have been suggested and validated particularly focusing on the manufacturing of functional composites using organic polymers and other inorganics vergaro et al 2010 yu et al 2016 lazzara et al 2018 however little efforts have made towards viable cell functionalization with hnts even though biocompatible clays could enhance the physicochemical functionalities of single cell organisms hu et al 2017 demonstrated that folate loading on hnts allows for the targeting of cancer cells with folate receptors further konnova et al 2013 showed that hnts aided by charged polymers such as poly allylamine hydrochloride and poly styrene sulfonate are able to coat yeast cells magnetic hnts appear to attach to yeast cells based on physical interactions between fe oxides composited in hnts and yeast cell walls konnova et al 2016 in general hnt surface modifications and additional agents are necessary to recruit the clays on the live cell surfaces moreover beneficial physiochemical functionalities resulting from the hnt attachments still remain to be questionable strongly suggesting that simpler and more functional surface engineering should be further explored here hnts were used as a fungal mycelium doping and functionalization agent through a fast and scalable dipping process the microbes used herein to model mycelium hnt interactions were aspergillus fumigatus a fungal species that has been previously applied in polymer immobilization based recalcitrant pollutant removal in aquatic environments wang et al 2008 and ganoderma lucidum a fungal species that belongs to white rot fungi showing powerful non specific oxidations have and

lucidum mycelia tem jeol 4010ht jeol japan xrd ultima iv rigaku japan and bet micromeritics asap2020 system usa analyses were conducted to characterize the hnts used herein the tem images fig 1 b clearly revealed the tubular microstructure of hnts with estimated lumen and outer diameter widths of approximately 25 nm and 90 nm respectively their longitudinal axis length was also estimated at approximately 2 µm the hnt xrd patterns fig s1a obtained with cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm using a 2θ range of 10 to 70 with a step size of 0 02 were consistent with two types of halloysites i e hydrated 10 å and dehydrated 7 å forms additionally the hnts included a silica phase detected as an abrupt peak pattern the langmuir surface area of the clay powders was evaluated by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig s1b and their curves were classified as type iv with h3 hysteresis loops which was indicative of capillary condensation and evaporation through mesopores based on the excellent linearity r2 0 999 of nitrogen sorption fig s1b inset the langmuir surface area slangmuir of the hnt powders was calculated to be 61 1 m2 g a fumigatus was cultivated using potato dextrose broths 30 and 180 rpm for a week unless otherwise stated to obtain bare fungal pellets ten to fifteen fungal pellets were soaked in hnt dispersed distilled water 40 mg of hnt powder 30 ml of distilled water unless otherwise stated and incubated for 24 h on a roller mixer 60 rpm at room temperature the pellets were then harvested with tweezers and thoroughly washed with distilled water upon inspection the doped fungi exhibited a slight brown color as illustrated in fig 1a tiny slices of potato dextrose agarose cultivating g lucidum mycelia were cultivated in potato dextrose broth after growing the mycelia with a proper length in the liquid hnt doping was performed as did above 2 3 ultrastructure and tga of hnt fungus hybrids bare and hnt doped fungal pellets were completely dried in an oven 70 for 1 2 days after which they were attached to a carbon based adhesive tape tedpella and gold sputtered the surface morphology of the hnt fungus hybrids and their aluminum distributions were then characterized via field emission sem eds philips xl30s feg chemical fixation was conducted to examine the three dimensional distribution of hnts on the pellets the fresh pellets were then soaked for 24 h in an aldehyde fixative solution composed of 4 ml of 20 paraformaldehyde 4 ml of 25 glutaraldehyde 20 ml of pbs buffer and 12 ml of distilled water followed by 1 h in an osmium fixative solution composed of 20 ml of pbs buffer 10 ml of distilled water and 10 ml of a 4 oso4 solution finally the chemically fixed pellets were thoroughly washed with acetone flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and divided into two equal portions sem eds was then conducted as described above tga q600 q200 ta was performed on the oven dried 70 for two days bare and hnt doped fungal pellets by increasing the air temperature at a 10 minute rate up to 1000 to quantify the amount of doped hnts 2 4 durability and viability of hnt fungus hybrids the dispersibility of hnts in organic solvent i e acetonitrile methanol ethanol or acetone 5 5 v v or salt i e nacl 0 5 m containing distilled water solutions 50 mg of hnt 10 ml of each solution was first determined by measuring their optical density at 600 nm after gentle shaking hnt fungus hybrids were soaked in each solution and incubated at room temperature for 24 h after gentle shaking an aliquot 1 ml of each solution was then used to measure optical density at 600 nm fungal viability was monitored via the dissolved oxygen consumption rates of bare and hnt doped fungal pellets before and after mb sorption which was performed by soaking the pellets in mb contaminated distilled water 50 ppm for 24 h each pellet group i e bare pellets without mb bare pellets with mb hnt doped pellets without mb hnt doped pellets with mb was then incubated in distilled water on a roller mixer 60 rpm at room temperature fully aerated distilled water was exchanged weekly and changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations were quantitatively monitored for 24 h from the time when the water was exchanged using an oxygen sensitive electrode mettler toledo this process was repeated up to 5 weeks 2 5 evaluation of gelation by hyphal spreading and exoenzyme production a fumigatus and g lucidum pellets were doped with hnts as described above with only a slight change in the hnt concentration i e 30 mg of hnt 30 ml of distilled water the hnt fungus hybrids were thoroughly washed with distilled water and incubated for 3 or 4 weeks in 24 well or 6 well plates containing potato dextrose broth without shaking the broths were then paper filtered and the filtered through water amounts were quantified the remaining gels were also photo imaged bare and hnt doped a fumigatus pellets were soaked in potato dextrose broth for 24 h at a roller 60 rpm the solutions were then centrifuged 13 000 rpm and 10 min and their supernatants proteins were quantified by a bradford assay with an albumin based standard curve 2 6 removal behavior of hnts and hnt fungus hybrids bare hnts and hnt fungus hybrids were soaked in mb mg cv and rbbr 50 ppm containing distilled water and then incubated in a roller mixer 60 rpm water aliquots were monitored to quantify residual mb mg cv and rbbr by measuring their absorbances at 665 617 585 and 595 nm respectively when the absorbance of the mb polluted waters was 0 1 the water was exchanged with fresh mb containing distilled water upon completing the removal experiments the pellets were dried in an oven 70 for one day based on the amounts of removed organic dyes the exact weights of the dry biomasses of bare and hnt fungus hybrids were calculated in conjunction with tga data confirming the doped hnt amounts the dye amount removed per unit mass of filamentous fungi was accurately calculated two kinds of real dye industry wastewaters table s1 were treated with bare and hnt doped a fumigatus pellets other procedures were followed as above except for use of 450 nm to monitor the extent of dye removal the mb and rbbr sorption behaviors of hnts alone were assessed based on langmuir isotherms 23 and compared with those of commercial activated carbon granules and powders the percentage sorption of dyes was calculated as follows percentage sorption 100 c 0 c e c 0 where c0 is the initial concentration of the dye solution and ce is the equilibrium concentration of the dye solution in mg l the adsorption equilibriums of each dye in the presence of hnt powder 20 mg and activated carbons 20 or 60 mg were also examined the equilibrium uptake was calculated as follows q e c 0 c e v w where qe is the amount of dye adsorbed by the sorption materials at equilibrium v is the volume of the solution in ml and w is the mass of the sorption materials used for the experiment in mg the langmuir isotherm indicates that c e q e c e q m 1 k 2 q m where k 2 is the langmuir adsorption constant in ml mg and qm is the dye adsorption capacity mg per mg of sorption materials an excellent linearity between ce qe and ce was observed as illustrated in figs s2 and s3 indicating that the sorption dynamics were consistent with the langmuir isotherm heavy metal salts copper zinc and chromium ions were completely dissolved in distilled water 30 ppm 10 ml proper amounts of absorbents i e bare and hnt doped fungi hnts 80 mg and granule activated carbons 80 mg were dispersed in the metal ion containing water and further incubated for 1 week on a roller 60 rpm at room temperature the supernatants after centrifugation 4000 rpm for 10 min were subjected into inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy optima 5300dv 8300dv perkinelmer to quantify residual copper and zinc ions chromium ions cr6 were analyzed by mirae environment research institute jinju republic of korea using a 1 5 diphenylcarbazide coloration based visible spectroscopy 3 results and discussion a fumigatus mycelial pellets were dipped in hnt dispersed distilled water and the harvested pellets were found to be brown colored suggesting that brown colored hnts spontaneously attached to the mycelia fig 1a sem analyses were conducted to obtain morphological evidence of hnt attachment on the pellet surfaces as seen in figs 1c and 1d the co presence of small sphere like particles and long fungal mycelia was observed in the doped samples eds analyses further indicated that the particles identified by sem imaging contained a much higher amount of aluminum atoms than the fungi alone fig 1e and f thereby confirming the presence of hnts which are known to contain alumina lazzara et al 2018 the surfaces of hnts are negatively charged due to their external layers consisting of siloxane i e si o si lazzara et al 2018 whereas fungal mycelium hydrophilicity appears to be modulated by the expression of hydrophobin proteins smits et al 2003 electrostatic or dipole dipole interactions are therefore likely involved in the fungus hnt hybrid s doping process given that the average hnt length is known to reach up to 1 5 µm lazzara et al 2018 and the hnts used herein were also within this range fig 1b it is also plausible that web like fungal mycelial networks physically trapped the clay nanoparticles to dissect the self assemblage of hnts and fungal mycelia in more detail three dimensional fungal pellets were split in half following a conventional fixation process eds analyses revealed that hnt attachment was concentrated in the outer surfaces fig 2 indicating that hnts could not easily penetrate the interior of the fungal pellet this may also be because the initial trapping and attachment of hnts on the outer surfaces resulted in the formation of a denser barrier thereby impeding further hnt attachment wastewater contains several kinds of pollutants depending on industrial sources for example pharmaceutical wastewater is known to contain some solvents such as methanol and acetone enright et al 2005 whereas highly saline wastewaters are released by the agro food and leather industries lefebvre and moletta 2006 the hnt fungus hybrid architectures should thus be resistant to organic solvents and salts in order for them to be effective in the treatment of a wide range of wastewater contaminants typical industrial solvents i e methanol acetonitrile and acetone mixed with 50 distilled water could not disrupt hnt attachment on the fungal pellets moreover a similar result was observed with a high salt sodium chloride concentration fig 3 physically adsorbed chemicals on organic macromolecules and mesoporous carbon materials have been found to readily desorb in the presence of organic solvents robinson et al 2002 tanthapanichakoon et al 2005 indicating that the doping process observed herein could be primarily attributed to tight physical trapping rather than electrostatic or dipole dipole interactions uncontrolled fungal mycelial spreading deteriorates the efficiency of water treatment by decelerating water flow rates and clogging the treatment facilities the extent of gelation driven by mycelium spreading was quantified and compared with and without doping as illustrated in fig 4 gelation was effectively inhibited by the presence of hnts on the fungal mycelia specifically the hnt doped fungal pellets were separate and largely unchanged after a 3 week incubation period in potato broth whereas the bare fungal pellets were completely gelated and individual pellets could hardly be identified these limitations on hyphal growth raised the question of whether fungal viability was affected by hnts fig 5 a fungi respiratory rates were thus monitored throughout the incubation period and were found to be largely unaffected by hnts doping this result indicates that the hyphal growth inhibition mediated by hnt doping was not likely to result from a severe stress response affecting the viability of the fungus cells another evidence regarding the normal viability was obtained by measuring exoenzymes fig 5b doped fungi were found to produce more exoenzymes than bare ones since fungal saprophytic features are based mainly on their exoenzymes harms et al 2011 this result supports that hnt doping hardly shows any defects on fungal catabolism it has been hypothesized that fungal tip growths orientate towards the direction of minimal surface free energy prosser and tough 1991 hnt deposition on the outer surfaces of fungal pellets would thus serve as a physical barrier providing fungal tips with much higher surface free energies another mechanism by which hnts inhibit hyphal growth may be associated to trace metal availability as illustrated by the previously reported effects of edta metal ion complexes on aspergillus niger growth choudhary and pirt 1965 given that hnts are known to adsorb metallic ions anastopoulos et al 2018 trace metal accessibility could be substantially reduced in hnt doped mycelia thereby limiting their uncontrolled growth tga was employed to calculate the exact amount of hnts doped onto fungal mycelia a near to zero mass was recorded at 800 in bare fungal pellets subjected to tga indicating that the inorganic contents of the fungi were negligible fig 6 the doped hnt amounts were found to be positively dependent on the hnt concentrations in the dipping solutions the effect of a fumigatus cultivation periods on the doped hnt amounts was also assessed and was found to slightly fluctuate fig 6d f hydrophobicity and density of mycelial pellets could vary with cultivation times prosser and tough 1991 smits et al 2003 these results thus suggest that hnt doping is feasible regardless of fungal incubation times however doping quantity may be modulated by the surface characteristics of the fungal pellet the bioremediation potential of fungus hnt hybrids was compared with that of bare fungal pellets mb contaminated water was used as a wastewater model and the bare fungal pellets were shown to be feasible in removing mb from aqueous media fig 7 b interestingly when treated with hnt doped fungal pellets the removal efficiency was dramatically enhanced in terms of both speed and quantity fig 7c the surface colors of the hybrid structures with mb removal indicated that a much faster adsorption occurred fig 7a other cationic toxic dyes such as mg and cv were also tested and the similar enhancements were observed using fungus hnt hybrids fig s4 supporting that versatile organic structures showing a cationic charge could be targeted we also assessed the oxygen consumption rates of hnt fungus hybrids before or after mb sorption to indirectly confirm whether fungal catabolism in the hybrid architectures could be inducible as shown in fig 5 a faster consumption of dissolved molecular oxygen was identified after mb sorption than before sorption at both 2 and 4 weeks of incubation this difference suggests that mb sorption mediated by hnt doped fungi facilitated aerobic catabolism given that the adsorbed mb was the only carbon source available in our experimental condition and aerobic catabolism is dependent on use of molecular oxygen since fungal catabolism is known to decompose organic pollutants including several micropollutants harms et al 2011 metabolic degradation coupled with accelerated sorption could synergistically lead to organic pollutant removal in fact organic pollutant removal through the simultaneous involvement of hnt sorption and tio2 based catalytic decomposition was previously reported li et al 2013 to better characterize the catabolic mechanisms involved in this process the resulting mb metabolites should be analyzed in detail using mass spectrometry as described previously by murugesan et al 2009 in addition exoenzymes profiling should be conducted to unravel detailed degradation mechanism although we here confirmed that the exoenzyme production is not diminished by hnt attachments fig 5b in this respect it is noticeable that enzymatic activity such as laccase is known to be more stabilized by hnts suggesting the doping could boost fungal exoenzymes reactions tully et al 2016 to evaluate dependence of pollutant charge on the sorption phenomena rbbr showing negative change was similarly used and largely similar removal kinetics were recorded between bare and hnt doped pellets fig 8 these results indicate that the sorption enhancement would derive from external siloxane surfaces of hnts showing a negative charge to obtain clear evidence on how hnts on the surface of the mycelia modulated dye removal in aqueous solutions the langmuir isotherm of the clays alone was assessed and compared with that of activated carbon as a reference sorption material as shown in figs s2 and s3 the hnts examined herein were proven to adsorb both cationic and anionic dyes but the sorption capacity of the cationic dyes was much higher which is consistent with the fungus hnt hybrid results figs 7 and 8 it is thus plausible that the observed removal enhancements were attributable to hnt doping moreover the hnt sorption capacity was almost comparable with that of commercial activated carbon powder in fact the ability of hnts to remove charged dyes has been previously characterized via langmuir isotherms liu et al 2011 however their physical sizes on the nano and micro scales may hinder water flow by blocking water paths therefore composite materials with hnts have been intensively developed to remediate pollutant contaminated waters yu et al 2016 since hnts are widely used to remove heavy metals from water yu et al 2016 anastopoulos et al 2018 sorption behaviors of some metallic ions i e cu2 zn2 and cr6 were assessed with fungus hnt hybrids and compared with bare fungal pellets hnts and commercial activated carbons alone as seen in fig 9 interestingly hnts alone showed much less sorption capacity than activated carbons but when doped with fungal mycelia the capacity became much superior reversely fungi alone showed inferior sorption activities than the hybrid structures suggesting hnts doped offer additional sorption sites in addition to the cationic dye sorption phenomena figs 7 and s4 this result indicates that hybridizing microbial and ceramic materials could be an effective strategy to compensate for the drawback of each material i e low sorption capacities of cationic organics and heavy metals by fungal mycelia and hnts respectively here we proved that hnt amounts doped are controllable fig 6 so that it is anticipated to readily manufacture the hybrids suited for specific wastewater pollutants by adjusting a ratio of the two materials a different filamentous fungus i e g lucidum was employed to confirm whether this doping is a universal way to modify fungal mycelia regardless of fungal species unlike a fumigatus it belongs to white rot fungi exhibiting a lignin biodegradation ability d souza et al 1999 and they grew like a sea urchin in the potato broth fig 10 a nonetheless surface color of g lucidum mycelia was significantly changed to bright brown through the hnt solution dipping indicating that hnts were successfully doped fig 10a the doping robustness against organic solvents and salts was also comparable to that of a fumigatus figs 3 and 10b as recorded in tga analyses figs 10c and d approximate 70 mass of the hybrids corresponded to hnt amounts doped the higher hnt amount than those of a fumigatus may be attributable to the sea urchin like mycelia of g lucidum inhibition of irregular mycelial spreading giving rise to water gelation was also similarly induced by the doping fig 10e as did in a fumigatus fig 4 finally real dye wastewaters table s1 were treated with bare and hnt doped a fumigatus pellets as recorded in fig 11 more accelerated reduction of visible color absorbance of the wastewaters was accompanied with the hnt doping which is very consistent with the artificial dye contaminated water experiments fig 7 overall our results strongly indicate that hnts could be successfully used to modify living fungal mycelia while preserving their viability and exoenzymes production and enhancing their water treatment properties given that these bio inorganic hybrids were proven to offer fungal catabolic activity and regulated mycelial growth our proposed approach could be a promising alternative to conventional polymer based fungus immobilization techniques for water treatment above all the ceramic doping described herein was based on a simple hnt solution dipping procedure indicating that this procedure could be easily scaled up moreover hnts as an inorganic ceramic are generally much more durable than polymeric organics in terms of heat acidity and mechanical forces hnts doped on fungal pellets could be thus readily harvested and then recycled after pollutant detachment as previously described chen et al 2014 to make the hybrid structures previously developed hnt functionalization methodologies associated with magnetic radical scavenging and photocatalytic properties konnova et al 2016 li et al 2013 wu et al 2017 could be readily paired with our proposed doping procedures thereby conferring much more versatile functionalities to living filamentous fungi for example we are currently developing hnt fungus hybrids with both sorption and visible light driven photocatalytic activity 4 conclusions our study developed a novel hnt doped fungal mycelia hybrid through a scalable and facile dipping methodology involving fungal pellets and a hnt dispersed aqueous solution doping feasibility appeared to be independent of fungal growth stages fungal species and hnt dosages although the specific doped clay amounts varied with fungal species and growth stages and clay doses fungal viability and exoenzyme production were also found to be largely unaffected by hnt attachment interestingly the hybrid architectures were found to effectively regulate mycelium spreading and enhanced bioremediation potential through a much faster cationic organic and inorganic pollutant recruitment on the surface of the hybrid pellets in addition the inherent low heavy metal removal capacity of hnts was compensated by fungal mycelia in the hybrids the durability of the nano clay fungus complexes in organic solvents and highly concentrated salt solutions suggested that they would be highly applicable for the treatment of a wide variety of pollutants in wastewater in fact we here proved that some real dye industry wastewaters could be decolorized faster with the doping the three dimensional distribution of hnts on the doped structures demonstrated that the nanotubes were largely concentrated on the outer surfaces of the fungal pellets we speculate that these distributions as well as the nano clay fungus complex durability and mycelial growth regulation were likely attributable to a tight physical entrapment of the hnts between web like mycelial networks overall our results suggest that environmentally benign ceramic materials such as halloysites could be used as a functional surface doping agent to enhance the water treatment capacity of filamentous fungi declaration of competing

sites therefore a new strategy is urgently required to overcome the current limitations of immobilization techniques while still maintaining their known advantages halloysite nanotubes hnts are naturally occurring mesoporous clay minerals with large surface areas and sorption capacities and could therefore be used as versatile agents for organic and inorganic material sorption yu et al 2016 these clay based nanomaterials are abundantly available cheap durable and nontoxic and therefore diverse applications for these materials have been suggested and validated particularly focusing on the manufacturing of functional composites using organic polymers and other inorganics vergaro et al 2010 yu et al 2016 lazzara et al 2018 however little efforts have made towards viable cell functionalization with hnts even though biocompatible clays could enhance the physicochemical functionalities of single cell organisms hu et al 2017 demonstrated that folate loading on hnts allows for the targeting of cancer cells with folate receptors further konnova et al 2013 showed that hnts aided by charged polymers such as poly allylamine hydrochloride and poly styrene sulfonate are able to coat yeast cells magnetic hnts appear to attach to yeast cells based on physical interactions between fe oxides composited in hnts and yeast cell walls konnova et al 2016 in general hnt surface modifications and additional agents are necessary to recruit the clays on the live cell surfaces moreover beneficial physiochemical functionalities resulting from the hnt attachments still remain to be questionable strongly suggesting that simpler and more functional surface engineering should be further explored here hnts were used as a fungal mycelium doping and functionalization agent through a fast and scalable dipping process the microbes used herein to model mycelium hnt interactions were aspergillus fumigatus a fungal species that has been previously applied in polymer immobilization based recalcitrant pollutant removal in aquatic environments wang et al 2008 and ganoderma lucidum a fungal species that belongs to white rot fungi showing powerful non specific oxidations have and

lucidum mycelia tem jeol 4010ht jeol japan xrd ultima iv rigaku japan and bet micromeritics asap2020 system usa analyses were conducted to characterize the hnts used herein the tem images fig 1 b clearly revealed the tubular microstructure of hnts with estimated lumen and outer diameter widths of approximately 25 nm and 90 nm respectively their longitudinal axis length was also estimated at approximately 2 µm the hnt xrd patterns fig s1a obtained with cu kα radiation λ 0 15406 nm using a 2θ range of 10 to 70 with a step size of 0 02 were consistent with two types of halloysites i e hydrated 10 å and dehydrated 7 å forms additionally the hnts included a silica phase detected as an abrupt peak pattern the langmuir surface area of the clay powders was evaluated by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig s1b and their curves were classified as type iv with h3 hysteresis loops which was indicative of capillary condensation and evaporation through mesopores based on the excellent linearity r2 0 999 of nitrogen sorption fig s1b inset the langmuir surface area slangmuir of the hnt powders was calculated to be 61 1 m2 g a fumigatus was cultivated using potato dextrose broths 30 and 180 rpm for a week unless otherwise stated to obtain bare fungal pellets ten to fifteen fungal pellets were soaked in hnt dispersed distilled water 40 mg of hnt powder 30 ml of distilled water unless otherwise stated and incubated for 24 h on a roller mixer 60 rpm at room temperature the pellets were then harvested with tweezers and thoroughly washed with distilled water upon inspection the doped fungi exhibited a slight brown color as illustrated in fig 1a tiny slices of potato dextrose agarose cultivating g lucidum mycelia were cultivated in potato dextrose broth after growing the mycelia with a proper length in the liquid hnt doping was performed as did above 2 3 ultrastructure and tga of hnt fungus hybrids bare and hnt doped fungal pellets were completely dried in an oven 70 for 1 2 days after which they were attached to a carbon based adhesive tape tedpella and gold sputtered the surface morphology of the hnt fungus hybrids and their aluminum distributions were then characterized via field emission sem eds philips xl30s feg chemical fixation was conducted to examine the three dimensional distribution of hnts on the pellets the fresh pellets were then soaked for 24 h in an aldehyde fixative solution composed of 4 ml of 20 paraformaldehyde 4 ml of 25 glutaraldehyde 20 ml of pbs buffer and 12 ml of distilled water followed by 1 h in an osmium fixative solution composed of 20 ml of pbs buffer 10 ml of distilled water and 10 ml of a 4 oso4 solution finally the chemically fixed pellets were thoroughly washed with acetone flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and divided into two equal portions sem eds was then conducted as described above tga q600 q200 ta was performed on the oven dried 70 for two days bare and hnt doped fungal pellets by increasing the air temperature at a 10 minute rate up to 1000 to quantify the amount of doped hnts 2 4 durability and viability of hnt fungus hybrids the dispersibility of hnts in organic solvent i e acetonitrile methanol ethanol or acetone 5 5 v v or salt i e nacl 0 5 m containing distilled water solutions 50 mg of hnt 10 ml of each solution was first determined by measuring their optical density at 600 nm after gentle shaking hnt fungus hybrids were soaked in each solution and incubated at room temperature for 24 h after gentle shaking an aliquot 1 ml of each solution was then used to measure optical density at 600 nm fungal viability was monitored via the dissolved oxygen consumption rates of bare and hnt doped fungal pellets before and after mb sorption which was performed by soaking the pellets in mb contaminated distilled water 50 ppm for 24 h each pellet group i e bare pellets without mb bare pellets with mb hnt doped pellets without mb hnt doped pellets with mb was then incubated in distilled water on a roller mixer 60 rpm at room temperature fully aerated distilled water was exchanged weekly and changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations were quantitatively monitored for 24 h from the time when the water was exchanged using an oxygen sensitive electrode mettler toledo this process was repeated up to 5 weeks 2 5 evaluation of gelation by hyphal spreading and exoenzyme production a fumigatus and g lucidum pellets were doped with hnts as described above with only a slight change in the hnt concentration i e 30 mg of hnt 30 ml of distilled water the hnt fungus hybrids were thoroughly washed with distilled water and incubated for 3 or 4 weeks in 24 well or 6 well plates containing potato dextrose broth without shaking the broths were then paper filtered and the filtered through water amounts were quantified the remaining gels were also photo imaged bare and hnt doped a fumigatus pellets were soaked in potato dextrose broth for 24 h at a roller 60 rpm the solutions were then centrifuged 13 000 rpm and 10 min and their supernatants proteins were quantified by a bradford assay with an albumin based standard curve 2 6 removal behavior of hnts and hnt fungus hybrids bare hnts and hnt fungus hybrids were soaked in mb mg cv and rbbr 50 ppm containing distilled water and then incubated in a roller mixer 60 rpm water aliquots were monitored to quantify residual mb mg cv and rbbr by measuring their absorbances at 665 617 585 and 595 nm respectively when the absorbance of the mb polluted waters was 0 1 the water was exchanged with fresh mb containing distilled water upon completing the removal experiments the pellets were dried in an oven 70 for one day based on the amounts of removed organic dyes the exact weights of the dry biomasses of bare and hnt fungus hybrids were calculated in conjunction with tga data confirming the doped hnt amounts the dye amount removed per unit mass of filamentous fungi was accurately calculated two kinds of real dye industry wastewaters table s1 were treated with bare and hnt doped a fumigatus pellets other procedures were followed as above except for use of 450 nm to monitor the extent of dye removal the mb and rbbr sorption behaviors of hnts alone were assessed based on langmuir isotherms 23 and compared with those of commercial activated carbon granules and powders the percentage sorption of dyes was calculated as follows percentage sorption 100 c 0 c e c 0 where c0 is the initial concentration of the dye solution and ce is the equilibrium concentration of the dye solution in mg l the adsorption equilibriums of each dye in the presence of hnt powder 20 mg and activated carbons 20 or 60 mg were also examined the equilibrium uptake was calculated as follows q e c 0 c e v w where qe is the amount of dye adsorbed by the sorption materials at equilibrium v is the volume of the solution in ml and w is the mass of the sorption materials used for the experiment in mg the langmuir isotherm indicates that c e q e c e q m 1 k 2 q m where k 2 is the langmuir adsorption constant in ml mg and qm is the dye adsorption capacity mg per mg of sorption materials an excellent linearity between ce qe and ce was observed as illustrated in figs s2 and s3 indicating that the sorption dynamics were consistent with the langmuir isotherm heavy metal salts copper zinc and chromium ions were completely dissolved in distilled water 30 ppm 10 ml proper amounts of absorbents i e bare and hnt doped fungi hnts 80 mg and granule activated carbons 80 mg were dispersed in the metal ion containing water and further incubated for 1 week on a roller 60 rpm at room temperature the supernatants after centrifugation 4000 rpm for 10 min were subjected into inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy optima 5300dv 8300dv perkinelmer to quantify residual copper and zinc ions chromium ions cr6 were analyzed by mirae environment research institute jinju republic of korea using a 1 5 diphenylcarbazide coloration based visible spectroscopy 3 results and discussion a fumigatus mycelial pellets were dipped in hnt dispersed distilled water and the harvested pellets were found to be brown colored suggesting that brown colored hnts spontaneously attached to the mycelia fig 1a sem analyses were conducted to obtain morphological evidence of hnt attachment on the pellet surfaces as seen in figs 1c and 1d the co presence of small sphere like particles and long fungal mycelia was observed in the doped samples eds analyses further indicated that the particles identified by sem imaging contained a much higher amount of aluminum atoms than the fungi alone fig 1e and f thereby confirming the presence of hnts which are known to contain alumina lazzara et al 2018 the surfaces of hnts are negatively charged due to their external layers consisting of siloxane i e si o si lazzara et al 2018 whereas fungal mycelium hydrophilicity appears to be modulated by the expression of hydrophobin proteins smits et al 2003 electrostatic or dipole dipole interactions are therefore likely involved in the fungus hnt hybrid s doping process given that the average hnt length is known to reach up to 1 5 µm lazzara et al 2018 and the hnts used herein were also within this range fig 1b it is also plausible that web like fungal mycelial networks physically trapped the clay nanoparticles to dissect the self assemblage of hnts and fungal mycelia in more detail three dimensional fungal pellets were split in half following a conventional fixation process eds analyses revealed that hnt attachment was concentrated in the outer surfaces fig 2 indicating that hnts could not easily penetrate the interior of the fungal pellet this may also be because the initial trapping and attachment of hnts on the outer surfaces resulted in the formation of a denser barrier thereby impeding further hnt attachment wastewater contains several kinds of pollutants depending on industrial sources for example pharmaceutical wastewater is known to contain some solvents such as methanol and acetone enright et al 2005 whereas highly saline wastewaters are released by the agro food and leather industries lefebvre and moletta 2006 the hnt fungus hybrid architectures should thus be resistant to organic solvents and salts in order for them to be effective in the treatment of a wide range of wastewater contaminants typical industrial solvents i e methanol acetonitrile and acetone mixed with 50 distilled water could not disrupt hnt attachment on the fungal pellets moreover a similar result was observed with a high salt sodium chloride concentration fig 3 physically adsorbed chemicals on organic macromolecules and mesoporous carbon materials have been found to readily desorb in the presence of organic solvents robinson et al 2002 tanthapanichakoon et al 2005 indicating that the doping process observed herein could be primarily attributed to tight physical trapping rather than electrostatic or dipole dipole interactions uncontrolled fungal mycelial spreading deteriorates the efficiency of water treatment by decelerating water flow rates and clogging the treatment facilities the extent of gelation driven by mycelium spreading was quantified and compared with and without doping as illustrated in fig 4 gelation was effectively inhibited by the presence of hnts on the fungal mycelia specifically the hnt doped fungal pellets were separate and largely unchanged after a 3 week incubation period in potato broth whereas the bare fungal pellets were completely gelated and individual pellets could hardly be identified these limitations on hyphal growth raised the question of whether fungal viability was affected by hnts fig 5 a fungi respiratory rates were thus monitored throughout the incubation period and were found to be largely unaffected by hnts doping this result indicates that the hyphal growth inhibition mediated by hnt doping was not likely to result from a severe stress response affecting the viability of the fungus cells another evidence regarding the normal viability was obtained by measuring exoenzymes fig 5b doped fungi were found to produce more exoenzymes than bare ones since fungal saprophytic features are based mainly on their exoenzymes harms et al 2011 this result supports that hnt doping hardly shows any defects on fungal catabolism it has been hypothesized that fungal tip growths orientate towards the direction of minimal surface free energy prosser and tough 1991 hnt deposition on the outer surfaces of fungal pellets would thus serve as a physical barrier providing fungal tips with much higher surface free energies another mechanism by which hnts inhibit hyphal growth may be associated to trace metal availability as illustrated by the previously reported effects of edta metal ion complexes on aspergillus niger growth choudhary and pirt 1965 given that hnts are known to adsorb metallic ions anastopoulos et al 2018 trace metal accessibility could be substantially reduced in hnt doped mycelia thereby limiting their uncontrolled growth tga was employed to calculate the exact amount of hnts doped onto fungal mycelia a near to zero mass was recorded at 800 in bare fungal pellets subjected to tga indicating that the inorganic contents of the fungi were negligible fig 6 the doped hnt amounts were found to be positively dependent on the hnt concentrations in the dipping solutions the effect of a fumigatus cultivation periods on the doped hnt amounts was also assessed and was found to slightly fluctuate fig 6d f hydrophobicity and density of mycelial pellets could vary with cultivation times prosser and tough 1991 smits et al 2003 these results thus suggest that hnt doping is feasible regardless of fungal incubation times however doping quantity may be modulated by the surface characteristics of the fungal pellet the bioremediation potential of fungus hnt hybrids was compared with that of bare fungal pellets mb contaminated water was used as a wastewater model and the bare fungal pellets were shown to be feasible in removing mb from aqueous media fig 7 b interestingly when treated with hnt doped fungal pellets the removal efficiency was dramatically enhanced in terms of both speed and quantity fig 7c the surface colors of the hybrid structures with mb removal indicated that a much faster adsorption occurred fig 7a other cationic toxic dyes such as mg and cv were also tested and the similar enhancements were observed using fungus hnt hybrids fig s4 supporting that versatile organic structures showing a cationic charge could be targeted we also assessed the oxygen consumption rates of hnt fungus hybrids before or after mb sorption to indirectly confirm whether fungal catabolism in the hybrid architectures could be inducible as shown in fig 5 a faster consumption of dissolved molecular oxygen was identified after mb sorption than before sorption at both 2 and 4 weeks of incubation this difference suggests that mb sorption mediated by hnt doped fungi facilitated aerobic catabolism given that the adsorbed mb was the only carbon source available in our experimental condition and aerobic catabolism is dependent on use of molecular oxygen since fungal catabolism is known to decompose organic pollutants including several micropollutants harms et al 2011 metabolic degradation coupled with accelerated sorption could synergistically lead to organic pollutant removal in fact organic pollutant removal through the simultaneous involvement of hnt sorption and tio2 based catalytic decomposition was previously reported li et al 2013 to better characterize the catabolic mechanisms involved in this process the resulting mb metabolites should be analyzed in detail using mass spectrometry as described previously by murugesan et al 2009 in addition exoenzymes profiling should be conducted to unravel detailed degradation mechanism although we here confirmed that the exoenzyme production is not diminished by hnt attachments fig 5b in this respect it is noticeable that enzymatic activity such as laccase is known to be more stabilized by hnts suggesting the doping could boost fungal exoenzymes reactions tully et al 2016 to evaluate dependence of pollutant charge on the sorption phenomena rbbr showing negative change was similarly used and largely similar removal kinetics were recorded between bare and hnt doped pellets fig 8 these results indicate that the sorption enhancement would derive from external siloxane surfaces of hnts showing a negative charge to obtain clear evidence on how hnts on the surface of the mycelia modulated dye removal in aqueous solutions the langmuir isotherm of the clays alone was assessed and compared with that of activated carbon as a reference sorption material as shown in figs s2 and s3 the hnts examined herein were proven to adsorb both cationic and anionic dyes but the sorption capacity of the cationic dyes was much higher which is consistent with the fungus hnt hybrid results figs 7 and 8 it is thus plausible that the observed removal enhancements were attributable to hnt doping moreover the hnt sorption capacity was almost comparable with that of commercial activated carbon powder in fact the ability of hnts to remove charged dyes has been previously characterized via langmuir isotherms liu et al 2011 however their physical sizes on the nano and micro scales may hinder water flow by blocking water paths therefore composite materials with hnts have been intensively developed to remediate pollutant contaminated waters yu et al 2016 since hnts are widely used to remove heavy metals from water yu et al 2016 anastopoulos et al 2018 sorption behaviors of some metallic ions i e cu2 zn2 and cr6 were assessed with fungus hnt hybrids and compared with bare fungal pellets hnts and commercial activated carbons alone as seen in fig 9 interestingly hnts alone showed much less sorption capacity than activated carbons but when doped with fungal mycelia the capacity became much superior reversely fungi alone showed inferior sorption activities than the hybrid structures suggesting hnts doped offer additional sorption sites in addition to the cationic dye sorption phenomena figs 7 and s4 this result indicates that hybridizing microbial and ceramic materials could be an effective strategy to compensate for the drawback of each material i e low sorption capacities of cationic organics and heavy metals by fungal mycelia and hnts respectively here we proved that hnt amounts doped are controllable fig 6 so that it is anticipated to readily manufacture the hybrids suited for specific wastewater pollutants by adjusting a ratio of the two materials a different filamentous fungus i e g lucidum was employed to confirm whether this doping is a universal way to modify fungal mycelia regardless of fungal species unlike a fumigatus it belongs to white rot fungi exhibiting a lignin biodegradation ability d souza et al 1999 and they grew like a sea urchin in the potato broth fig 10 a nonetheless surface color of g lucidum mycelia was significantly changed to bright brown through the hnt solution dipping indicating that hnts were successfully doped fig 10a the doping robustness against organic solvents and salts was also comparable to that of a fumigatus figs 3 and 10b as recorded in tga analyses figs 10c and d approximate 70 mass of the hybrids corresponded to hnt amounts doped the higher hnt amount than those of a fumigatus may be attributable to the sea urchin like mycelia of g lucidum inhibition of irregular mycelial spreading giving rise to water gelation was also similarly induced by the doping fig 10e as did in a fumigatus fig 4 finally real dye wastewaters table s1 were treated with bare and hnt doped a fumigatus pellets as recorded in fig 11 more accelerated reduction of visible color absorbance of the wastewaters was accompanied with the hnt doping which is very consistent with the artificial dye contaminated water experiments fig 7 overall our results strongly indicate that hnts could be successfully used to modify living fungal mycelia while preserving their viability and exoenzymes production and enhancing their water treatment properties given that these bio inorganic hybrids were proven to offer fungal catabolic activity and regulated mycelial growth our proposed approach could be a promising alternative to conventional polymer based fungus immobilization techniques for water treatment above all the ceramic doping described herein was based on a simple hnt solution dipping procedure indicating that this procedure could be easily scaled up moreover hnts as an inorganic ceramic are generally much more durable than polymeric organics in terms of heat acidity and mechanical forces hnts doped on fungal pellets could be thus readily harvested and then recycled after pollutant detachment as previously described chen et al 2014 to make the hybrid structures previously developed hnt functionalization methodologies associated with magnetic radical scavenging and photocatalytic properties konnova et al 2016 li et al 2013 wu et al 2017 could be readily paired with our proposed doping procedures thereby conferring much more versatile functionalities to living filamentous fungi for example we are currently developing hnt fungus hybrids with both sorption and visible light driven photocatalytic activity 4 conclusions our study developed a novel hnt doped fungal mycelia hybrid through a scalable and facile dipping methodology involving fungal pellets and a hnt dispersed aqueous solution doping feasibility appeared to be independent of fungal growth stages fungal species and hnt dosages although the specific doped clay amounts varied with fungal species and growth stages and clay doses fungal viability and exoenzyme production were also found to be largely unaffected by hnt attachment interestingly the hybrid architectures were found to effectively regulate mycelium spreading and enhanced bioremediation potential through a much faster cationic organic and inorganic pollutant recruitment on the surface of the hybrid pellets in addition the inherent low heavy metal removal capacity of hnts was compensated by fungal mycelia in the hybrids the durability of the nano clay fungus complexes in organic solvents and highly concentrated salt solutions suggested that they would be highly applicable for the treatment of a wide variety of pollutants in wastewater in fact we here proved that some real dye industry wastewaters could be decolorized faster with the doping the three dimensional distribution of hnts on the doped structures demonstrated that the nanotubes were largely concentrated on the outer surfaces of the fungal pellets we speculate that these distributions as well as the nano clay fungus complex durability and mycelial growth regulation were likely attributable to a tight physical entrapment of the hnts between web like mycelial networks overall our results suggest that environmentally benign ceramic materials such as halloysites could be used as a functional surface doping agent to enhance the water treatment capacity of filamentous fungi declaration of competing

17556,traditional bioenergy recovery in the form of short chain fatty acids scfas from waste activated sludge was is generally limited by economic unattractiveness and complexity of products separation herein a novel biotechnology process of two stage anaerobic fermentation for converting the was into high energy density easy separated medium chain fatty acids mcfas and long chain alcohols lcas was evaluated in this process the was was first converted to was alkaline fermentation liquid wasafl serving as electron acceptors eas and inoculum then adding ethanol as electron donor ed for chain elongation ce the co production of mcfas and lcas during ce were studied under three different ed to ea ratios i e 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 experimental results demonstrated that when the ratio of ed to ea increased from 3 1 to 5 1 the production of mcfa and lcas respectively increased from 5 57 0 17 and 2 58 0 18 to7 67 0 48 and 4 21 0 19 g cod l a similar observation was made in the total product electron efficiency increasing from 59 9 to 72 1 however the highest total product selectivity i e 68 0 and highest products production yield i e 59 77 were not achieved at the ed to ea ratio of 5 1 due to toxicity caused by higher accumulation of n caproate the kinetic analysis further confirmed that high ratio of ed to ea induced improvement in product maximum yield production rate for both mcfas and lcas microbial community analysis indicated that clostridium caproiciproducens acinetobacter exilispira and oscillibacter were clearly enriched in the ce reactor and had positive

european union produced around 9 0 106 tons dw each year eurostat 2018 substantial disposal costs incurred by the continuously produced was has posed great economical challenge for the long term

processes e g anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation have recently attracted growing attention by which was reduction and recovery of valuable bioenergy and resource can be simultaneously achieved luo et al 2016 wang et al 2018a for example wei et al 2020 reported that dosing biochar 1 82 3 06 g g total solid ts in digester enhanced methane production by 8 6 17 8 with 14 reduction in

considered as a promising method to treat was yang et al 2015 to promote bio conversion of organic matters in sludge during anaerobic fermentation obtaining more scfas output considerable efforts such as sludge pretreatment methods and operation parameters optimization have been conducted li et al 2014 liu et al 2019 rao et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 for example zhang et al 2018 found that sludge pretreated by 176 5 mg free ammonia l for 3 days could increase scfas concentration to 267 2 mg cod g vss by destroying the extracellular polymeric substances and cell envelope of sludge cells liu et al 2019 applied the heat cao2 67 4 c and 0 12 g g vss advanced thermal hydrolysis to pretreat sludge to increase proportion of biodegradable organic matters resulting in a maximum scfas concentration of 336 5 mg cod g vss however scfas featuring good hydrophility are not easy to be separated and purified from fermentation broth wu et al 2019a moreover importantly given the relatively low energy density 873 7 2793 9 kj mol scfas are unsuitable for direct use as fuel steinbusch et al 2011 those characteristics greatly limit the scope of utilization of scfas thereby decreasing economic benefits and application potentiality of was anaerobic fermentation singhania et al 2013 wu et al 2019b in this sense upgrading or transforming scfas to high energy and easily separable products is urgently needed recently a newly developed biotechnology i e chain elongation ce process may provide an alternative solution for the bioconversion of scfas during which anaerobic microbe uses acetyl coa provided by the oxidation of electron donor ed as the cyclic molecule to interact with scfas as electron acceptor ea extending its carbon chain length with two carbons at each cycle and producing medium chain fatty acids mcfas i e carboxylic acids with carbon atoms ranging from 6 to 12 angenent et al 2016 compared to scfas o c ratios range from 1 1 to 2 5 mcfas featuring higher energy density 3492 4 4798 7 kj mol due to lower oxygen carbon ratios 1 3 1 6 can be used as versatile precursors for the production of biofuels and various industrial products such as fragrances kenealy et al 1995 food additive xu et al 2015 and antimicrobial agent p desbois 2012 etc besides because mcfas have long hydrophobic carbon chains it is therefore easily separated from fermentation liquor with consuming less cost agler et al 2012 therefore mcfas are regarded as more profitable chemical ge et al 2015 in the ce process ethanol has been demonstrated to be one of the most ideal ed because which not only could be produced from large amount of industrial and agricultural waste e g brewing wastewater and lignocellulose but also could lead to relatively high mcfa productivity kucek et al 2016 in our recent study we utilized synthetic was alkaline fermentation liquor wasafl to enrich scfas as a novel ea to produce mcfas via ce process using ethanol as ed demonstrating firstly the feasibility of upgrading scfas from was anaerobic fermentation into mcfas different from other organic feedstocks such as food waste and dried chicken manure the compositions of scfas in wasafl can be distinct from those that have been reported nzeteu et al 2018 lonkar et al 2016 besides after alkaline fermentation lots of acid producing microorganisms are enriched in the wasafl which might be more favorable for ce process more importantly the use of wasafl provides an alternative sludge fermentation technology to simultaneously reducing was amounts and recover high energy density easy separated mcfas specifically three different ethanol to wasafl ratios i e 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 were performed to investigate the effect of ed to ea ratio on the production of mcfas the results showed that 72 9 of highest mcfa synthesis rate was achieved at the ed to ea ratio of 1 1 wu et al 2019b however unexpectedly in addition to mcfas it was also found that some amount of long chain alcohols lcas i e n butanol and n hexanol were produced during the ce of wasafl similar to mcfas synthesis of lcas has received increasing interest because of energy and sustainability concerns dekishima et al 2011 furthermore lcas has the advantages of being less hygroscopic being less volatile being less corrosive and being less explosive was regard as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels fernández naveira et al 2017 consequently lcas was another more attractive product compared with scfas however it was worth noticing that lcas were detected only at the tested highest ratio i e 2 1 of ed to ea and its corresponding production only accounted for the 9 8 of the total organic carbon this phenomenon leads us to raise a question can further increase in the ratio of ed to ea enhance the yield of lcas achieving desired co production of mcfas and lcas although the effect of the ed to ea ratio on the structure and production of mcfas has been confirmed liu et al 2016 its evaluation on the cod distribution and co production of mcfas and lcas are still limited moreover in our previous study the inoculum enriching microorganisms related with carboxylate acid production was obtained from the anaerobic digested sludge wu et al 2019b previous studies suggested that there were also potential carboxylic acid producing microorganisms in the real wasafl wan et al 2016 such as genus clostridium which was considered potentially to produce mcfas and lcas e g clostridium kluyveri and clostridium ljungdahlii consequently another question has also caused our concern can wasafl be used directly to produce mcfas and lcas without inoculating exogenous microorganisms if it can which will make scfas upgrade via ce process more convenient strengthening the feasibility of potential application by answering questions proposed above the objective of this study is therefore to investigate the feasibility of co production of mcfas and lcas using real wasafl simultaneously as ea and inoculum in a two stage anaerobic fermentation system firstly the co production of mcfas and lcas was investigated and compared at high carbon molar ratios of ed to ea i e ethanol to wasafl carbon molar ratios are 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 then the modified gompertz equation was applied to simulate the maximum production potential of mcfas and lcas moreover microbial community comparison was conducted to elucidate the performance of co production of mcfas and lcas under different ce conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 was feedstock the was used in this study was collected from a secondary sedimentation tank of quyang municipal wwtp shanghai china the collected sludge was stored at 4 c and concentrated by settling 1 day for later use the main characteristics of the concentrated was were presented in table 1 2 2 experiment settings of the whole reaction as the direct ethanol addition could exert toxicity effect on acidogenic microorganism inhibiting the hydrolysis of organic matter and scfas production grootscholten et al 2014 more recently a few researchers have demonstrated that mcfas production from organic wastes using the two stage fermentation strategy can avoid the toxicity effects of both high concentrations of ethanol and produced mcfas on hydrolysis grootscholten et al 2014 reddy et al 2018 therefore to obtain better products yield scfas production from alkaline fermentation of was i e the preparation of wasafl and chain elongation of wasafl using ethanol as ed were divided into two stage in brief the was was first treated by alkaline condition ph 10 to produce scfas during the stage one after the maximum scfas yield was achieved during the stage one the obtained wasfl which was employed as inoculum and ea was fed together with ethanol to perform ce process during the stage two the technical roadmap of this work was shown in fig 1 2 2 1 was alkaline fermentation experiment for scfas production stage one alkaline condition not only improved scfas production through increased soluble cod but also inhibited scfas consumption by methanogens thus enhancing scfas accumulation rao et al 2018 yuan et al 2006 therefore alkaline fermentation i e ph 10 of was was performed in this study to produce scfas each reactor with working volume of 800 ml received 500 ml was as aforementioned the ph was adjusted to 10 0 1 with 3 m naoh solutions then the reactor was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove residual oxygen sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 35 1 c at stirring speed of 120 rpm each reactor was controlled ph at 10 0 1 during anaerobic fermentation liquid samples were regularly taken to measure the produced scfas when the scfas production was no long increasing the leachate containing scfas was collected and stored in the refrigerator at 4 c as the wasafl for the later use of ce reactor 2 2 2 chain elongation experiments for mcfas and lcas production from wasafl stage two at stage two fig 1 ce experiments were conducted to evaluate mcfas and lcas production with ethanol as the ed and wasafl as both the ea and inoculum under three different carbon molar ratio conditions i e 3 1 r1 4 1 r2 and 5 1 r3 which were carried out in 3 identical serum vials with a volume of 120 ml for each serum vial 62 5 ml of wasafl obtained in section 2 2 1 was firstly added then three concentrations of ethanol i e 226 63 2 52 298 95 3 96 and 380 59 5 09 mmol l were also respectively added to achieve the desired carbon molar ratios of ed to ea i e 3 1 4 1 5 1 the detailed concentrations of substrates used for ce experiments were shown in table s1 supporting information moreover to inhibit methanogenesis i e the conversion of scfas to methane a certain amount of 2 bromoethanosulfonic acid 10 5 g l was respectively added into each serum vial liu et al 2017 the ph was adjusted to 5 5 by using 2 0 m hydrochloric acid and 2 0 m sodium hydroxide duber et al 2018 the headspace was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min after then each serum vial was closed with a rubber stopper retained with an aluminum crimp cap finally the serum vials were incubated at 37 1 c in an air bath shaker 170 rpm the ce experiments lasted over 30 days until the concentrations of mcfas and lcas were no long increasing and ethanol was not further consumed all tests were conducted in triplicate 2 3 kinetic analysis of the mcfas and lcas production a kinetic analysis was used to evaluate the products production potential and rates of the ce processes with wasafl as ea and inoculum simultaneously which were conducted in accordance with method reported by diender et al 2016 briefly the output of mcfas and lcas production under three different ratios of ethanol to wasafl i e 3 1 4

parameters am and γ were simulated according to the real experimental data by originpro 8 4 origin lab corporation ma us 2 4 microbial community analysis after the ce experiments with three different ratios of ethanol to wasafl reached stable performance for mcfas and lcas production three sludge samples were collected from the ce reactors and conducted illumina miseq sequencing analysis to further understand the ce process with wasafl as both ea and inoculum from the aspect of microbial community the original leachate of wasafl was also performed microbial analysis as comparison moreover to figure out the variations of the community structures of all samples during the whole ce period the sludge samples from day 5 and 10 were taken out together for community analysis briefly 8 ml of sludge mixture was taken out and centrifuged 4 c 12 000 rpm for 5 min dynamica velocity 14r australia the sediment was then stored in the refrigerator at 80 c for later use according to the

2019 wei et al 2017 alcohols scfas and mcfas fraction in liquid samples were measured by a gas chromatography shimadau gc 2010 plus japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and a stabilwax da polyethylene glycol capillary column the analysis method was determined according to the method reported previously zhang et al 2013 the sum of measured alcohols scfas and mcfas were calculated based on specific cod conversion coefficients i e 1 g of ethanol 2 09 g cod 1 g of butanol 2 59 g cod 1 g of hexanol 2 78 g cod 1 g of acetate 1 07 g cod 1 g of propionate 1 51 g cod 1 g of butyrate 1 82 g cod 1 g of valerate 2 04 g cod 1 g of caproate 2 21 g cod 1 g of heptanoate 2 34 g cod 1 g of caprylate 2 44 g cod liu and chen 2018 3 results 3 1 scfas production from was alkaline fermentation in the process of two stage fermentation scfas were both the key products of stage one i e was alkaline fermentation and the main substrates of following stage two i e ce process fig s1 shows the production of scfas from was alkaline fermentation it could be observed that the concentration of scfas production almost no long changed after 8 d of fermentation which was in accordance with previous literature yuan et al 2006 as a result 2730 mg cod l of scfas in the leachate were obtained in this stage moreover the scfas mainly were carboxylic acids with 2 5 carbon atoms i e acetate propionate butyrate and valerate and the corresponding concentrations were respectively 1278 45 456 20 531 15 and 465 24 mg cod l 3 2 mcfas and lcas co production in the ce process of wasafl fermentation after was alkaline fermentation the leachate from stage one was collected as wasafl which was then used for ce experiment working as ea and inoculum to perform ce process i e stage two different ethanol levels were added into wasafl according to the designed ed to ea ratios i e r1 3 1 r2 4 1 and r3 5 1 under the three conditions of substrate combination the variation of substrates utilization and products generation were shown in fig 2 as expected three types of mcfas i e n caproate n heptanoate and n caprylate and two types of lcas i e n butanol and n hexanol were produced and reached to a stationary level at the end of 33 days fermentation it was clearly to see that a high ratio of ed to ea was beneficial to the production of mcfas and lcas the total cumulative mcfas concentration slightly rose by approximately 0 02 g cod l with an increase of the ed ea ratio from 3 1 to 4 1 and then notably increased by around 2 06 g cod l with the increase of ed ea ratio to 5 1 in comparison the final lcas concentration significantly increased by 1 45 g cod l with ed ea ratio increased from 3 1 to 4 1 and then further increased slightly only by 0 19 g cod l at the ed ea ratio of 5 1 therefore both the maximum cumulative mcfas and lcas concentration were obtained with respect to the ed ea ratio of 5 1 with the values of 7 67 0 48 and 4 21 0 19 g cod l respectively besides the products production yields of mcfas and lcas in terms of scfas from wasafl and ethanol were calculated by formula according to eq 2 lonkar et al 2016 and listed in the table s2 although both the mcfas and lcas production were highest at the ratio of ed ea of 5 1 the total products production yields mcfas and lcas together did not change significantly under different ratio of ed ea ranging between 56 32 59 77 this indicated that the high ratio of ed to ea evidently promoted the mcfas and lcas co production but had no significant influence on their production yields but meanwhile it should be noted that both the production of mcfas and lcas were closely related to their corresponding longer chain acyl coa thus the competition between mcfas and lcas was existed in this co fermentation system too much increase on one side would lead to an increment decrease in the other gomez and cantero 2007 machado et al 2012 2 production yield produced products g total scfas g fed ethanol g 100 where produced products refer to mcfas or lcas as shown in fig 2 a c e the concentration of ethanol under three fermenters decreased rapidly at the initial 2 10 days and then gradually further decreased when the ethanol concentration no long decreased i e 28 33 days the mcfas and lcas production also reached to a stationary level fig 2b 2d 2f indicating that ethanol was mainly consumed to produce mcfas and lcas during ce of wasafl however ethanol was only depleted just at the ed ea ratio of 3 1 and over 20 of ethanol was left at another two ed to ea ratios i e 4 1 and 5 1 which suggested that the residual ethanol could not participate in ce process this may be due to the large amount of undissociated mcfas produced that has a toxic effect on ce microorganisms coma et al al 2016 skrivanova et al 2006 the inhibitory effect of mcfas on ce process have been unveiled by previous study specifically when the undissociated caproate exceeds 0 2 g l it can inhibit microbial activity and its own production liu et al 2017 in this study due to the high accumulated mcfas concentration with a relatively low ph value 5 03 and 4 94 respectively the concentration of undissociated caproate was speculated as 0 24 g l and 0 44 g l at the case with ed ea ratio of 4 1 and 5 1 respectively as for the eas it was worth noting that except for propionate all the other scfas i e acetate butyrate and valerate were more or less left in the three fermenters the depletion of propionate in the first 7 days under all fermentation conditions is likely due to that propionate could only be consumed as the substrate chain elongating to valerate and further to n heptanoate but not be generated during ce process the butyrate and valerate had not been exhausted thoroughly the concentration of butyrate even increased substantially the constant concentration of valerate and the increase in butyrate implied that although they were continually consumed to produce mcfas i e n caproate and n heptanoate and lca i e n butanol they could be produced via the ce of propionate and acetate interestingly although acetate as the main ea cannot be generated by the ce process its concentration slightly increased at the case with ed ea ratio of 3 1 and 4 1 this suggested a certain amount of acetate was generated in the r1 and r2 fermenter the generation of acetate may mainly come from the oxidation of ethanol and homoacetogenesis process in the open culture system it was inevitably that ethanol would be dispersed to take place excessive ethanol oxidation to generate acetate competing with ce process spirito et al 2018 in addition h2 could be produced figure s2 in si during ce which could serve as the ed for the formation of acetate through homoacetogenesis saady 2013 spirito et al 2014 3 3 mcfas and lcas selectivity and electron efficiency in the ce process of wasafl fermentation the final products distribution based on the electron contained in all organic substances at three different ed to ea ratios were calculated and presented in fig 3 a the highest cumulative mcfas selectivity accounting for 42 7 of the total organic carbon contents was achieved at the highest ratio of ed to ea i e 5 1 which was similar with the total mcfas production by comparison the selectivity of mcfas was occupied for 38 1 and 39 3 at the ed ea ratios of 3 1 and 4 1 respectively however the obtained mcfas selectivity in this study was much lower than that reported by our previous research with the similar fermentation system which achieved the highest total proportion of mcfas of 72 9 at the ed to ea ratio of 1 1 wu et al 2019b the decrease in the mcfas selectivity in this system could be ascribed to the generation of lcas which can compete with mcfas see section 3 2 notably although lcas production was highest at the ratio of ed ea of 5 1 fig 2f the highest total selectivity of lcas was obtained at the ed ea ratio of 4 1 and accounted for 28 7 at another two conditions the lcas selectivity separately was 17 7 and 23 6 at the ed ea ratio of 3 1 and 5 1 calculating all products i e mcfas and lcas together the highest total product selectivity i e 68 0 was also obtained at ed ea ratio of 4 1 instead of 5 1 in fact in addition to the products selectivity the total products electron efficiency can also reflect the energy recovery from fermentation organics and the degree of electrons from substrates to products which normally was calculated by metric according to eq 3 liu et al 2017 since the total mass of gas products mainly hydrogen were only around 0 1 0 3 mmol the corresponding slight change in consumption substrates 0 2 0 6 mmol electrons was not considered in calculation fig 3b demonstrates the total products mcfa and lca electron efficiency during the whole ce reaction the calculated total substance electrons were increased slighter within 9 than the sum electrons of scfas contained in wasafl and consumed ethanol which possibly obtained from the organics of inoculum and indicated the roughly balanced electrons in the wasafl fermentation system under three ratios of ed to ea the product equilibrium reached fastest on day 14 at the highest ratio of ed to ea i e 5 1 and after 28 days fermentation when ethanol was no long consumed see figs 2 and 3b all the product output efficiency basically reached a stable stage the highest total proportion of products i e 72 1 was observed at ed ea ratio of 5 1 although by the end of the ce the electron efficiency was much same at ed ea ratio of 4 1 and 5 1 3 electron efficiency electron number in product electron number in wasafl electron number consumed in ethanol 100 3 4 kinetic analysis of mcfas and lcas production in the ce process of wasafl fermentation in order to assess the total production potential and rates of mcfas and lcas during the ce experiments a modified gompertz equation was applied to fit the experimental data of total mcfas and lcas production under different ed to ea ratios as n caproate could act as substrate for both n caprylate and n hexanol formation thus the estimated total production of n caproate was calculated by the sum of the observed concentration of n caproate plus n caprylate and n hexanol diender et al 2016 fig 4 showed the simulated mcfas and lcas production profiles by the modified gompertz equation which well captured the experimental data in each case r2 0 95 the specific values of three kinetic parameters i e maximum product yield potential am the maximum product production rate vm and lag phase time γ were listed in table s3 on the whole high ratio of ed ea was positively correlated with high am and vm the highest am of both mcfas and lcas was attained at the ratio of ed ea of 5 1 which was increased respectively by approximately 29 from 8 37 0 18 g cod l to 10 77 0 41 g cod l and 55 from 2 67 0 05 g cod l to 4 15 0 18 g cod l in comparison to that at ed ea ratio of 3 1 similar trend was also clearly observed in the vm except for n caprylate which maintained a constant production rate due to the toxicity effect of substrate ethanol and products counteracted the high substrate supply by the high ratio of ed ea the vm of all the other products increased by 1 06 4 38 times when the ed to ea ratio was increased from 3 1 to 5 1 however higher ratio of ed ea extended the appearance time of products resulting in long γ the simulated γ of almost all products mcfas and lcas was extended by 1 03 4 47 times from ed ea ratio of 3 1 to 5 1 these results indicate that high ratio of ed ea did significantly enhance mcfas and lcas maximum yield potential and speed their production rate but extend their appearance time 3 5 microbial community analysis for mcfas and lcas production in the ce process of wasafl fermentation to further clarify the mechanisms of wasafl as ea and inoculum to produce mcfas and lcas via two stage system the microbial community structures under different ethanol to wasafl ratios were detected and compared among all samples r0 represented the original inoculum r1 r2 and r3 were enriched from ce sludge with ed ea ratios of 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 all samples finally yield 42 360 reads and covered 732 otus on average the rarefaction curves of all samples at 0 03 distance showed that all lines reached saturation and shared the same abscissa fig s3 in si proving that the captured microbial otus were representative and reliable the α diversity is a comprehensive indicator of microbial community richness and diversity which can be reflected by chao index and simpson index respectively the corresponding specific values of four samples were presented in table s4 it was found that the α diversity of the ce sludge samples with larger chao and lower simpson index were significantly higher p 0 05 than those of the original inoculum i e r0 indicating that the diversity and richness of the microbial community was increased during the ce process fig 5 a shows the phylum level distribution of the microbial abundance of four samples among the top 9 phyla firmicutes and proteobacteria were thought to be able to isolate wild type strain bacterial strains that produce mcfa angenent et al 2016 however the relative abundance of these two phyla was not completely consistent with the increase of ed ea ratio proteobacteria decreased from 11 23 in the inoculum to 5 64 7 45 of three ce sludge samples but phylum firmicutes increased from 6 41 to 11 8 18 52 thus further research and comparation on genus and species level were essential which could provide more accurate information on microbial functions and metabolic capacities chen et al 2016 fig 5b exhibits the final microbial compositions at genus level in different sludge samples there was no detection of genus level microorganisms from proteobacteria related to ce process genera clostridium sensus stricto caproiciproducens and eubacterium affiliated to firmicutes were responsible for ce process angenent et al 2016 kim et al 2015 its abundances increased from 0 17 0 and 0 in original inoculum i e r0 to 1 02 2 59 0 38 1 58 and 1 73e 5 4 9e 4 in ce sludge samples i e r1 r2 and r3 respectively blasting the otus belonged to clostridium sensus stricto caproiciproducens and eubacterium on national central for biotechnology information ncbi database to figure out the species information and the corresponding results were presented in table s5 it can be seen that these matched species all belonged to clostridium sensus stricto but no species belonging to caproiciproducens and eubacterium concretely some of otus belong to clostridium kluyveri identity 99 which was by far the best known species to produce mcfas angenent et al 2016 it was reportedly that the c kluyveri could ferment ethanol and acetate into butanol and hexanol dekishima et al 2011 the relative abundance of c kluyveri was enriched from 0 in r0 initial inoculum to 0 85 in r3 ed ea of 5 1 moreover some of the otus from clostridium sensus stricto were identified to clostridium ljungdahlii identity 94 85 and clostridium autoethanogenum identity 96 93 which were reported to be capable of reducing carboxylates to their responding alcohols perez et al 2013 richter et al 2016 c ljungdahlii enriched from 0 to 0 2 and c autoethanogenum enriched from 0 to 0 53 from r1to r3 these results were accordance with the produced content of lcas which proved both c ljungdahlii and c autoethanogenum might positive correlated with the production of lcas this could reveal what happens in ce process and explain why mcfas and lcas could be co produced from the aspect of microbial community several other genera such as acinetobacter exilispira oscillibacter involved in anaerobic fermentation were also enriched during ce process it was demonstrated that oscillibacter and acinetobacter were positively correlated with the production of mcfas wu et al 2018 their abundances were found to be 0 and 0 in original inoculum i e r0 while 1 69 4 93 and 1 82e 4 5 53e 4 in ce sludge samples i e r1 r2 and r3 respectively till now there is no research of directly performing ce process by these bacteria however the strong correlation between their abundance and ce products production demonstrated that they might be favorable for the ce process when utilizing wasafl as substrate and ethanol as ed in addition the wasafl obtained from stage one containing lots of scfas as ea also worked as the inoculum during stage two its time series shift of key microorganisms associated with scfas production and ce were presented in fig 6 the key microorganisms involved in the scfas production in this system were mainly affiliated to the genera of fonticella sp and proteiniclasticum sp luo et al 2020 yin et al 2018 etc the continuing fermentation time changed the microbial community structures mainly by weakening these scfas producers that their total relative abundance was 1 2 on day 0 r0 then significantly decreased to 0 08 0 37 r1 r3 during day 5 10 due to the rapid enhancement of ce and finally reduced to 0 05 0 35 at the end of the ce experiment 33 day in contrast the extension of ce fermentation time enriched these ce related microbes i e clostridium sensus stricto oscillibacter acinetobacter that the relative abundance significantly increased from 0 55 on day 0 r0 to 15 93 19 4 on day 5 r1 r3 then further increased to 18 24 25 49 on day 10 r1 r3 but finally decreased to 5 42 7 87 on day 33 these results were consistent with the variation of ce performance fig 2 and products production rate fig 4 which clearly proved that the functional microorganisms were shifted in the direction from scfas production to ce process with rapid growth during 0 10 day and then decreased growth afterwards 4 discussion this study confirmed the practicability of using a real wasafl as substrate and ethanol as ed via ce process to achieve the co production of more valuable products i e mcfas and lcas this was experimentally demonstrated in a two stage system consisted of scfas production from alkaline fermentation i e the preparation of real wasafl and ce experiment the two stage system separated the acidification of was and ce processes avoiding the toxicity from both high concentrations of ethanol and generated mcfas on was hydrolysis grootscholten et al 2014 both the scfas production and ce process were guaranteed to operate under their separate optimal conditions as a result abundant of scfas were generated in stage one then the leachate of stage one reacted with ethanol to perform ce obtaining high yield of mcfas and lcas the beneficial of two stage system over single stage system have also been verified by other literatures grootscholten et al separately conducted the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw hydrolysis and ce experiment in two consecutive reactors and the yield of mcfas achieved was almost 5 times that of one stage system with the same substrates grootscholten et al 2014 reddy et al also obtained high caproate production 8 1 g l through the operation of a two stage reactor with food waste as fermentation substrate reddy et al 2018 in stage two the ce results showed that higher ed to ea ratio boosted the co production as well as electron efficiency of mcfas and lcas the maximum mcfas and lcas production was respectively 7 67 0 48 g cod l and 4 21 0 19 g cod l which was achieved at the highest ed to ea ratio of 5 1 meanwhile the total product electron efficiency increased from 59 9 at ed ea ratio of 3 1 to 72 1 at ed ea ratio of 5 1 fig 4b the high ratio of ed to ea was benefited to the production of mcfas which was consistent with previous reports yin et al 2017 reported that within the appropriate concentration range the yield of mcfas mainly caproate increased with the increase of ethanol acetate ratio which possibly due to high ethanol concentration promoted microbial growth similarly lonkar et al 2016 observed that higher alcohol to acid ratio enhanced the mcfas production because of active ce microorganisms and high substrate availability when ethanol concentration was maintained within 5 10 g l however to our present knowledge there is no research concerned on the co production of mcfas and lcas with organic waste as substrate directly theoretically the lcas could be generated via the reduction of their corresponding carboxylic acids or directly through the coa dependent pathway machado et al 2012 richter et al 2016 namely the n butanol and n hexanol could be produced from the reduction of n butyrate and n caproate or the catalyzation of butyryl coa and hexanoyl coa during ce process n butyrate was mainly produced via the combination of butyryl coa with acetate likewise n caproate was produced via the combination of hexanoyl coa with n butyrate spirito et al 2014 consequently no matter which pathway was predominant the production of lcas was mainly related to the content of their corresponding coa substantial acetyl coa could be generated from ethanol at the high ratio of ed to ea angenent et al 2016 liu et al 2016 which provided the sufficient substrate for coa with long carbons resulting in high concentration of lcas surprisingly with the increase of ed ea ratio from 3 1 to 5 1 the proportion of remaining ethanol in the reactor increased from 0 to 25 53 fig 2 meanwhile it can be observed that the concentration of ethanol decreased the slowest after the 10 d in the case of ed ea ratio of 5 1 as compared with other two ed to ea ratios this was likely attributed to the toxicity of the produced undissociated caproate affecting the activity of the ce microorganisms theoretically the dissociation of carboxylic acids was calculated using the formula ph pka lg dissociated carboxylic acid undissociated carboxylic acid when the concentration of produced mcfa is very high and or the environment is at rather acidic condition it is likely to generate undissociated mcfas at the ed ea ratio of 4 1 and 5 1 the concentration of produced mcfas were rather high with a relatively low ph value 5 03 and 4 94 respectively resulting in that the final concentration of undissociated caproate reached up to 0 24 g l and 0 44 g l exceeding the toxicity threshold 0 2 g l on the microorganism liu et al 2017 it could also be therefore understood that there is a large amount of ethanol and butyrate at higher ed ea ratios i e 4 1 and 5 1 but the concentrations of mcfas and lcas cannot continue to increase in the later period of the ce experiment which resulted in the total product production yields table s2 and the maximum total product selectivity not increasing with the increase of ed ea ratios fig 3 moreover the toxic effect of undissociated caproate may also be the reason for the prolonged appearance of the product when the ed ea ratio increased from 3 1 to 5 1 the simulated lag phase time of mcfas and lcas was extended by 1 03 4 47 times fig 4 for instance the n caprylate production time was delayed from the early period to the later period of the ce experiment with the increase of ed ea ratio from 3 1 to 5 1 the co production of mcfas and lcas could be supported by the variations of the decreased scfas producers and enriched functional ce microorganisms such as clostridium kluyveri clostridium ljungdahlii clostridium autoethanogenum oscillibacter and acinetobacter concerned on previous studies with pure or open culture system the above microorganisms were all affirmed as the beneficial microbes to mcfas and lcas production diender et al 2016 richter et al 2016 wu et al 2018 these microorganisms positively related to mcfas and lcas production were all observed the increased relative abundance after ce process indicating that real wasafl obtained in stage one can be utilized directly as ea and inoculum compared to the additional inoculum i e digested sludge used in our previous study it should be noted that the abundance of ce related microbes was highest at 5 10 days due to the adequate substrate supply and then decreased gradually because of the toxicity of produced mcfas which was consistent with the changes of ce performance fig 2 and products production rate fig 4 large amount of previous studies has confirmed that was could be utilized as a recycle resource rather than a waste for example resource recovery through the scfa production of anaerobic fermentation yuan et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 however the low value and high solubility of scfas will inevitably limit the large scale practical application of this method in comparison mcfas and lcas which had higher caloric value and were easier to separate could be processed into many commercial products e g antimicrobial agent animal food additive and fuel precursors etc for engineering application fernández naveira et al 2017 leng et al 2017 in this study the co production of mcfas and lcas using real wasafl simultaneously as ea and inoculum as well as ethanol as ed was fulfilled the products performance and microbial analysis proved that wasafl contained significant ce microbes and could be used directly to produce mcfas and lcas without inoculating exogenous microorganisms meaning the ease of handing procedure and reduction of investment cost a preliminary economic evaluation was conducted based on the results of lab scale test in this study to estimate the potential economic feasibility of the proposed two stage was fermentation technology with increasing mcfas from 5 57 7 67 g cod l and lcas from 2 58 4 21 g cod l co production from two stage was anaerobic fermentation the net economic benefit is estimated to be around 325 67 to 474 71 ton ts table s6 this net benefit arises from the enhanced mcfas and lcas production associated benefit overweighing the additional costs for ethanol and methane inhibitor therefore this novel two stage was fermentation technology for mcfa and lca co production is economically favorable while for reasons concerning economic costs and eco friendly considerations the ethanol source should be obtained sustainably from some organic wastes e g yeast fermentation beer and syngas fermentation effluent or in situ ethanol generation from wastewater in a bio electrochemical system agler et al 2012 vasudevan et al 2014 which might further facilitate the economic feasibility of the proposed technology considering the large amount of was daily generated worldwide the two stage method based on the combined anaerobic fermentation and ce biotechnology reported in this study therefore not only has potentially important significance for high value energy recovery of sludge but also give great support to the long term application of sludge anaerobic fermentation however it should be noted that the produced mcfa i e undissociated caproate could affect the microbial activity in ce system coma et al 2016 affecting the production of mcfas and lcas at high ethanol to wasafl ratio therefore to improve ethanol utilization mcfas and lcas production yields and selectivity as well as shorten lag phase time the product extraction system should be applied in future study to weaken the toxic effect of ce products in addition one of the main purposes was to evaluate the feasibility of co production of mcfas and lcas at high ratio of ed to ea only three ratios of ed to ea i e 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 were performed therefore to obtain the optimal production of mcfas and lcas more and comprehensive ratios of ed to ea should be conducted in the future 5 conclusions the feasibility of achieving the co production of mcfas and lcas using real wasafl simultaneously as ea and inoculum as well as ethanol as ed was comprehensively assessed by ce performance assays in this work the co production of mcfas and lcas was increased with the increase of the carbon molar ratio of ethanol to wasafl but the maximum total product selectivity was achieved at the ed ea ratio of 4 1 due to the high accumulation of n butyrate the kinetic analysis showed the data were well fitted to the modified gompertz equation all the maximal mcfas and lcas production potential and rate as well as lag phase time increased with the increase of ed ea ratio from 3 1 to 5 1 the functional microorganisms were shifted in the direction from scfas production to ce process in the early stage of wasafl fermentation the relative abundances of clostridium kluyveri clostridium ljungdahlii and clostridium autoethanogenum which were positively related to mcfas and lcas production enriched during the ce process indicating that real wasafl can be utilized directly as inoculum declaration of competing

17556,traditional bioenergy recovery in the form of short chain fatty acids scfas from waste activated sludge was is generally limited by economic unattractiveness and complexity of products separation herein a novel biotechnology process of two stage anaerobic fermentation for converting the was into high energy density easy separated medium chain fatty acids mcfas and long chain alcohols lcas was evaluated in this process the was was first converted to was alkaline fermentation liquid wasafl serving as electron acceptors eas and inoculum then adding ethanol as electron donor ed for chain elongation ce the co production of mcfas and lcas during ce were studied under three different ed to ea ratios i e 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 experimental results demonstrated that when the ratio of ed to ea increased from 3 1 to 5 1 the production of mcfa and lcas respectively increased from 5 57 0 17 and 2 58 0 18 to7 67 0 48 and 4 21 0 19 g cod l a similar observation was made in the total product electron efficiency increasing from 59 9 to 72 1 however the highest total product selectivity i e 68 0 and highest products production yield i e 59 77 were not achieved at the ed to ea ratio of 5 1 due to toxicity caused by higher accumulation of n caproate the kinetic analysis further confirmed that high ratio of ed to ea induced improvement in product maximum yield production rate for both mcfas and lcas microbial community analysis indicated that clostridium caproiciproducens acinetobacter exilispira and oscillibacter were clearly enriched in the ce reactor and had positive

application of biological wastewater treatment waste activated sludge was as the major by product of above process is generated in huge quantities worldwide wang et al 2018b for instance in china it s estimated that the yield of was can be up to 4 8 108 tons dry matter dw 80 water content in 2020 li et al 2018 the united states has an average annual sewage sludge production of 1 78 107 tons dw

european union produced around 9 0 106 tons dw each year eurostat 2018 substantial disposal costs incurred by the continuously produced was has posed great economical challenge for the long term operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps wei et al 2018 on the other hand carbon rich was contains substantial organic substances such as proteins and polysaccharides which can be utilized and converted into value added fuels and chemicals e g methane and short chain fatty acids scfas liu et al 2019 rao et al 2018 therefore the research and application of effective sludge treatment processes e g anaerobic digestion and anaerobic fermentation have recently attracted growing attention by which was reduction and recovery of valuable bioenergy and resource can be simultaneously achieved luo et al 2016 wang et al 2018a for example wei et al 2020 reported that dosing biochar 1 82 3 06 g g total solid ts in digester enhanced methane production by 8 6 17 8 with 14 reduction in

considered as a promising method to treat was yang et al 2015 to promote bio conversion of organic matters in sludge during anaerobic fermentation obtaining more scfas output considerable efforts such as sludge pretreatment methods and operation parameters optimization have been conducted li et al 2014 liu et al 2019 rao et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 for example zhang et al 2018 found that sludge pretreated by 176 5 mg free ammonia l for 3 days could increase scfas concentration to 267 2 mg cod g vss by destroying the extracellular polymeric substances and cell envelope of sludge cells liu et al 2019 applied the heat cao2 67 4 c and 0 12 g g vss advanced thermal hydrolysis to pretreat sludge to increase proportion of biodegradable organic matters resulting in a maximum scfas concentration of 336 5 mg cod g vss however scfas featuring good hydrophility are not easy to be separated and purified from fermentation broth wu et al 2019a moreover importantly given the relatively low energy density 873 7 2793 9 kj mol scfas are unsuitable for direct use as fuel steinbusch et al 2011 those characteristics greatly limit the scope of utilization of scfas thereby decreasing economic benefits and application potentiality of was anaerobic fermentation singhania et al 2013 wu et al 2019b in this sense upgrading or transforming scfas to high energy and easily separable products is urgently needed recently a newly developed biotechnology i e chain elongation ce process may provide an alternative solution for the bioconversion of scfas during which anaerobic microbe uses acetyl coa provided by the oxidation of electron donor ed as the cyclic molecule to interact with scfas as electron acceptor ea extending its carbon chain length with two carbons at each cycle and producing medium chain fatty acids mcfas i e carboxylic acids with carbon atoms ranging from 6 to 12 angenent et al 2016 compared to scfas o c ratios range from 1 1 to 2 5 mcfas featuring higher energy density 3492 4 4798 7 kj mol due to lower oxygen carbon ratios 1 3 1 6 can be used as versatile precursors for the production of biofuels and various industrial products such as fragrances kenealy et al 1995 food additive xu et al 2015 and antimicrobial agent p desbois 2012 etc besides because mcfas have long hydrophobic carbon chains it is therefore easily separated from fermentation liquor with consuming less cost agler et al 2012 therefore mcfas are regarded as more profitable chemical ge et al 2015 in the ce process ethanol has been demonstrated to be one of the most ideal ed because which not only could be produced from large amount of industrial and agricultural waste e g brewing wastewater and lignocellulose but also could lead to relatively high mcfa productivity kucek et al 2016 in our recent study we utilized synthetic was alkaline fermentation liquor wasafl to enrich scfas as a novel ea to produce mcfas via ce process using ethanol as ed demonstrating firstly the feasibility of upgrading scfas from was anaerobic fermentation into mcfas different from other organic feedstocks such as food waste and dried chicken manure the compositions of scfas in wasafl can be distinct from those that have been reported nzeteu et al 2018 lonkar et al 2016 besides after alkaline fermentation lots of acid producing microorganisms are enriched in the wasafl which might be more favorable for ce process more importantly the use of wasafl provides an alternative sludge fermentation technology to simultaneously reducing was amounts and recover high energy density easy separated mcfas specifically three different ethanol to wasafl ratios i e 1 2 1 1 and 2 1 were performed to investigate the effect of ed to ea ratio on the production of mcfas the results showed that 72 9 of highest mcfa synthesis rate was achieved at the ed to ea ratio of 1 1 wu et al 2019b however unexpectedly in addition to mcfas it was also found that some amount of long chain alcohols lcas i e n butanol and n hexanol were produced during the ce of wasafl similar to mcfas synthesis of lcas has received increasing interest because of energy and sustainability concerns dekishima et al 2011 furthermore lcas has the advantages of being less hygroscopic being less volatile being less corrosive and being less explosive was regard as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels fernández naveira et al 2017 consequently lcas was another more attractive product compared with scfas however it was worth noticing that lcas were detected only at the tested highest ratio i e 2 1 of ed to ea and its corresponding production only accounted for the 9 8 of the total organic carbon this phenomenon leads us to raise a question can further increase in the ratio of ed to ea enhance the yield of lcas achieving desired co production of mcfas and lcas although the effect of the ed to ea ratio on the structure and production of mcfas has been confirmed liu et al 2016 its evaluation on the cod distribution and co production of mcfas and lcas are still limited moreover in our previous study the inoculum enriching microorganisms related with carboxylate acid production was obtained from the anaerobic digested sludge wu et al 2019b previous studies suggested that there were also potential carboxylic acid producing microorganisms in the real wasafl wan et al 2016 such as genus clostridium which was considered potentially to produce mcfas and lcas e g clostridium kluyveri and clostridium ljungdahlii consequently another question has also caused our concern can wasafl be used directly to produce mcfas and lcas without inoculating exogenous microorganisms if it can which will make scfas upgrade via ce process more convenient strengthening the feasibility of potential application by answering questions proposed above the objective of this study is therefore to investigate the feasibility of co production of mcfas and lcas using real wasafl simultaneously as ea and inoculum in a two stage anaerobic fermentation system firstly the co production of mcfas and lcas was investigated and compared at high carbon molar ratios of ed to ea i e ethanol to wasafl carbon molar ratios are 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 then the modified gompertz equation was applied to simulate the maximum production potential of mcfas and lcas moreover microbial community comparison was conducted to elucidate the performance of co production of mcfas and lcas under different ce conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 was feedstock the was used in this study was collected from a secondary sedimentation tank of quyang municipal wwtp shanghai china the collected sludge was stored at 4 c and concentrated by settling 1 day for later use the main characteristics of the concentrated was were presented in table 1 2 2 experiment settings of the whole reaction as the direct ethanol addition could exert toxicity effect on acidogenic microorganism inhibiting the hydrolysis of organic matter and scfas production grootscholten et al 2014 more recently a few researchers have demonstrated that mcfas production from organic wastes using the two stage fermentation strategy can avoid the toxicity effects of both high concentrations of ethanol and produced mcfas on hydrolysis grootscholten et al 2014 reddy et al 2018 therefore to obtain better products yield scfas production from alkaline fermentation of was i e the preparation of wasafl and chain elongation of wasafl using ethanol as ed were divided into two stage in brief the was was first treated by alkaline condition ph 10 to produce scfas during the stage one after the maximum scfas yield was achieved during the stage one the obtained wasfl which was employed as inoculum and ea was fed together with ethanol to perform ce process during the stage two the technical roadmap of this work was shown in fig 1 2 2 1 was alkaline fermentation experiment for scfas production stage one alkaline condition not only improved scfas production through increased soluble cod but also inhibited scfas consumption by methanogens thus enhancing scfas accumulation rao et al 2018 yuan et al 2006 therefore alkaline fermentation i e ph 10 of was was performed in this study to produce scfas each reactor with working volume of 800 ml received 500 ml was as aforementioned the ph was adjusted to 10 0 1 with 3 m naoh solutions then the reactor was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove residual oxygen sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 35 1 c at stirring speed of 120 rpm each reactor was controlled ph at 10 0 1 during anaerobic fermentation liquid samples were regularly taken to measure the produced scfas when the scfas production was no long increasing the leachate containing scfas was collected and stored in the refrigerator at 4 c as the wasafl for the later use of ce reactor 2 2 2 chain elongation experiments for mcfas and lcas production from wasafl stage two at stage two fig 1 ce experiments were conducted to evaluate mcfas and lcas production with ethanol as the ed and wasafl as both the ea and inoculum under three different carbon molar ratio conditions i e 3 1 r1 4 1 r2 and 5 1 r3 which were carried out in 3 identical serum vials with a volume of 120 ml for each serum vial 62 5 ml of wasafl obtained in section 2 2 1 was firstly added then three concentrations of ethanol i e 226 63 2 52 298 95 3 96 and 380 59 5 09 mmol l were also respectively added to achieve the desired carbon molar ratios of ed to ea i e 3 1 4 1 5 1 the detailed concentrations of substrates used for ce experiments were shown in table s1 supporting information moreover to inhibit methanogenesis i e the conversion of scfas to methane a certain amount of 2 bromoethanosulfonic acid 10 5 g l was respectively added into each serum vial liu et al 2017 the ph was adjusted to 5 5 by using 2 0 m hydrochloric acid and 2 0 m sodium hydroxide duber et al 2018 the headspace was flushed with nitrogen gas for 5 min after then each serum vial was closed with a rubber stopper retained with an aluminum crimp cap finally the serum vials were incubated at 37 1 c in an air bath shaker 170 rpm the ce experiments lasted over 30 days until the concentrations of mcfas and lcas were no long increasing and ethanol was not further consumed all tests were conducted in triplicate 2 3 kinetic analysis of the mcfas and lcas production a kinetic analysis was used to evaluate the products production potential and rates of the ce processes with wasafl as ea and inoculum simultaneously which were conducted in accordance with method reported by diender et al 2016 briefly the output of mcfas and lcas production under three different ratios of ethanol to wasafl i e 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 were fitted by a modified gompertz model eq 1 1 p t a m exp exp v m e a m γ t 1 where p t is the cumulative product production g cod l at time t am indicates the maximal product potential g cod l at the end of anaerobic fermentation t is the fermentation time day vm is the maximum product production rate g cod l d γ represents the lag phase day and e is 2 71828 among all the above parameters am and γ were simulated according to the real experimental data by originpro 8 4 origin lab corporation ma us 2 4 microbial community analysis after the ce experiments with three different ratios of ethanol to wasafl reached stable performance for mcfas and lcas production three sludge samples were collected from the ce reactors and conducted illumina miseq sequencing analysis to further understand the ce process with wasafl as both ea and inoculum from the aspect of microbial community the original leachate of wasafl was also performed microbial analysis as comparison moreover to figure out the variations of the community structures of all samples during the whole ce period the sludge samples from day 5 and 10 were taken out together for community analysis briefly 8 ml of sludge mixture was taken out and centrifuged 4 c 12 000 rpm for 5 min dynamica velocity 14r australia the sediment was then stored in the refrigerator at 80 c for later use according to the protocols of manufacturer the microbial dna of all sludge samples was extracted with the fast dna spin kit for soil mp bio u s the concentration and purification of dna were detected by nanodrop 2000

2019 wei et al 2017 alcohols scfas and mcfas fraction in liquid samples were measured by a gas chromatography shimadau gc 2010 plus japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and a stabilwax da polyethylene glycol capillary column the analysis method was determined according to the method reported previously zhang et al 2013 the sum of measured alcohols scfas and mcfas were calculated

in the process of two stage fermentation scfas were both the key products of stage one i e was alkaline fermentation and the main substrates of following stage two i e ce process fig s1 shows the production of scfas from was alkaline fermentation it could be observed that the concentration of scfas production almost no long changed after 8 d of fermentation which was in accordance with previous literature yuan et al 2006 as a result 2730 mg cod l of scfas in the leachate were obtained in this stage moreover the scfas mainly were carboxylic acids with 2 5 carbon atoms i e acetate propionate butyrate and valerate and the corresponding concentrations were respectively 1278 45 456 20 531 15 and 465 24 mg cod l 3 2 mcfas and lcas co production in the ce process of wasafl fermentation after was alkaline fermentation the leachate from stage one was collected as wasafl which was then used for ce experiment working as ea and inoculum to perform ce process i e stage two different ethanol levels were added into wasafl according to the designed ed to ea ratios i e r1 3 1 r2 4 1 and r3 5 1 under the three conditions of substrate combination the variation of substrates utilization and products generation were shown in fig 2 as expected three types of mcfas i e n caproate n heptanoate and n caprylate and two types of lcas i e n butanol and n hexanol were produced and reached to a stationary level at the end of 33 days fermentation it was clearly to see that a high ratio of ed to ea was beneficial to the production of mcfas and lcas the total cumulative mcfas concentration slightly rose by approximately 0 02 g cod l with an increase of the ed ea ratio from 3 1 to 4 1 and then notably increased by around 2 06 g cod l with the increase of ed ea ratio to 5 1 in comparison the final lcas concentration significantly increased by 1 45 g cod l with ed ea ratio increased from 3 1 to 4 1 and then further increased slightly only by 0 19 g cod l at the ed ea ratio of 5 1 therefore both the maximum cumulative mcfas and lcas concentration were obtained with respect to the ed ea ratio of 5 1 with the values of 7 67 0 48 and 4 21 0 19 g cod l respectively besides the products production yields of mcfas and lcas in terms of scfas from wasafl and ethanol were calculated by formula according to eq 2 lonkar et al 2016 and listed in the table s2 although both the mcfas and lcas production were highest at the ratio of ed ea of 5 1 the total products production yields mcfas and lcas together did not change significantly under different ratio of ed ea ranging between 56 32 59 77 this indicated that the high ratio of ed to ea evidently promoted the mcfas and lcas co production but had no significant influence on their production yields but meanwhile it should be noted that both the production of mcfas and lcas were closely related to their corresponding longer chain acyl coa thus the competition between mcfas and lcas was existed in this co fermentation system too much increase on one side would lead to an increment decrease in the other gomez and cantero 2007 machado et al 2012 2 production yield produced products g total scfas g fed ethanol g 100 where produced products refer to mcfas or lcas as shown in fig 2 a c e the concentration of ethanol under three fermenters decreased rapidly at the initial 2 10 days and then gradually further decreased when the ethanol concentration no long decreased i e 28 33 days the mcfas and lcas production also reached to a stationary level fig 2b 2d 2f indicating that ethanol was mainly consumed to produce mcfas and lcas during ce of wasafl however ethanol was only depleted just at the ed ea ratio of 3 1 and over 20 of ethanol was left at another two ed to ea ratios i e 4 1 and 5 1 which suggested that the residual ethanol could not participate in ce process this may be due to the large amount of undissociated mcfas produced that has a toxic effect on ce microorganisms coma et al al 2016 skrivanova et al 2006 the inhibitory effect of mcfas on ce process have been unveiled by previous study specifically when the undissociated caproate exceeds 0 2 g l it can inhibit microbial activity and its own production liu et al 2017 in this study due to the high accumulated mcfas concentration with a relatively low ph value 5 03 and 4 94 respectively the concentration of undissociated caproate was speculated as 0 24 g l and 0 44 g l at the case with ed ea ratio of 4 1 and 5 1 respectively as for the eas it was worth noting that except for propionate all the other scfas i e acetate butyrate and valerate were more or less left in the three fermenters the depletion of propionate in the first 7 days under all fermentation conditions is likely due to that propionate could only be consumed as the substrate chain elongating to valerate and further to n heptanoate but not be generated during ce process the butyrate and valerate had not been exhausted thoroughly the concentration of butyrate even increased substantially the constant concentration of valerate and the increase in butyrate implied that although they were continually consumed to produce mcfas i e n caproate and n heptanoate and lca i e n butanol they could be produced via the ce of propionate and acetate interestingly although acetate as the main ea cannot be generated by the ce process its concentration slightly increased at the case with ed ea ratio of 3 1 and 4 1 this suggested a certain amount of acetate was generated in the r1 and r2 fermenter the generation of acetate may mainly come from the oxidation of ethanol and homoacetogenesis process in the open culture system it was inevitably that ethanol would be dispersed to take place excessive ethanol oxidation to generate acetate competing with ce process spirito et al 2018 in addition h2 could be produced figure s2 in si during ce which could serve as the ed for the formation of acetate through homoacetogenesis saady 2013 spirito et al 2014 3 3 mcfas and lcas selectivity and electron efficiency in the ce process of wasafl fermentation the final products distribution based on the electron contained in all organic substances at three different ed to ea ratios were calculated and presented in fig 3 a the highest cumulative mcfas selectivity accounting for 42 7 of the total organic carbon contents was achieved at the highest ratio of ed to ea i e 5 1 which was similar with the total mcfas production by comparison the selectivity of mcfas was occupied for 38 1 and 39 3 at the ed ea ratios of 3 1 and 4 1 respectively however the obtained mcfas selectivity in this study was much lower than that reported by our previous research with the similar fermentation system which achieved the highest total proportion of mcfas of 72 9 at the ed to ea ratio of 1 1 wu et al 2019b the decrease in the mcfas selectivity in this system could be ascribed to the generation of lcas which can compete with mcfas see section 3 2 notably although lcas production was highest at the ratio of ed ea of 5 1 fig 2f the highest total selectivity of lcas was obtained at the ed ea ratio of 4 1 and accounted for 28 7 at another two conditions the lcas selectivity separately was 17 7 and 23 6 at the ed ea ratio of 3 1 and 5 1 calculating all products i e mcfas and lcas together the highest total product selectivity i e 68 0 was also obtained at ed ea ratio of 4 1 instead of 5 1 in fact in addition to the products selectivity the total products electron efficiency can also reflect the energy recovery from fermentation organics and the degree of electrons from substrates to products which normally was calculated by metric according to eq 3 liu et al 2017 since the total mass of gas products mainly hydrogen were only around 0 1 0 3 mmol the corresponding slight change in consumption substrates 0 2 0 6 mmol electrons was not considered in calculation fig 3b demonstrates the total products mcfa and lca electron efficiency during the whole ce reaction the calculated total substance electrons were increased slighter within 9 than the sum electrons of scfas contained in wasafl and consumed ethanol which possibly obtained from the organics of inoculum and indicated the roughly balanced electrons in the wasafl fermentation system under three ratios of ed to ea the product equilibrium reached fastest on day 14 at the highest ratio of ed to ea i e 5 1 and after 28 days fermentation when ethanol was no long consumed see figs 2 and 3b all the product output efficiency basically reached a stable stage the highest total proportion of products i e 72 1 was observed at ed ea ratio of 5 1 although by the end of the ce the electron efficiency was much same at ed ea ratio of 4 1 and 5 1 3 electron efficiency electron number in product electron number in wasafl electron number consumed in ethanol 100 3 4 kinetic analysis of mcfas and lcas production in the ce process of wasafl fermentation in order to assess the total production potential and rates of mcfas and lcas during the ce experiments a modified gompertz equation was applied to fit the experimental data of total mcfas and lcas production under different ed to ea ratios as n caproate could act as substrate for both n caprylate and n hexanol formation thus the estimated total production of n caproate was calculated by the sum of the observed concentration of n caproate plus n caprylate and n hexanol diender et al 2016 fig 4 showed the simulated mcfas and lcas production profiles by the modified gompertz equation which well captured the experimental data in each case r2 0 95 the specific values of three kinetic parameters i e maximum product yield potential am the maximum product production rate vm and lag phase time γ were listed in table s3 on the whole high ratio of ed ea was positively correlated with high am and vm the highest am of both mcfas and lcas was attained at the ratio of ed ea of 5 1 which was increased respectively by approximately 29 from 8 37 0 18 g cod l to 10 77 0 41 g cod l and 55 from 2 67 0 05 g cod l to 4 15 0 18 g cod l in comparison to that at ed ea ratio of 3 1 similar trend was also clearly observed in the vm except for n caprylate which maintained a constant production rate due to the toxicity effect of substrate ethanol and products counteracted the high substrate supply by the high ratio of ed ea the vm of all the other products increased by 1 06 4 38 times when the ed to ea ratio was increased from 3 1 to 5 1 however higher ratio of ed ea extended the appearance time of products resulting in long γ the simulated γ of almost all products mcfas and lcas was extended by 1 03 4 47 times from ed ea ratio of 3 1 to 5 1 these results indicate that high ratio of ed ea did significantly enhance mcfas and lcas maximum yield potential and speed their production rate but extend their appearance time 3 5 microbial community analysis for mcfas and lcas production in the ce process of wasafl fermentation to further clarify the mechanisms of wasafl as ea and inoculum to produce mcfas and lcas via two stage system the microbial community structures under different ethanol to wasafl ratios were detected and compared among all samples r0 represented the original inoculum r1 r2 and r3 were enriched from ce sludge with ed ea ratios of 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 all samples finally yield 42 360 reads and covered 732 otus on average the rarefaction curves of all samples at 0 03 distance showed that all lines reached saturation and shared the same abscissa fig s3 in si proving that the captured microbial otus were representative and reliable the α diversity is a comprehensive indicator of microbial community richness and diversity which can be reflected by chao index and simpson index respectively the corresponding specific values of four samples were presented in table s4 it was found that the α diversity of the ce sludge samples with larger chao and lower simpson index were significantly higher p 0 05 than those of the original inoculum i e r0 indicating that the diversity and richness of the microbial community was increased during the ce process fig 5 a shows the phylum level distribution of the microbial abundance of four samples among the top 9 phyla firmicutes and proteobacteria were thought to be able to isolate wild type strain bacterial strains that produce mcfa angenent et al 2016 however the relative abundance of these two phyla was not completely consistent with the increase of ed ea ratio proteobacteria decreased from 11 23 in the inoculum to 5 64 7 45 of three ce sludge samples but phylum firmicutes increased from 6 41 to 11 8 18 52 thus further research and comparation on genus and species level were essential which could provide more accurate information on microbial functions and metabolic capacities chen et al 2016 fig 5b exhibits the final microbial compositions at genus level in different sludge samples there was no detection of genus level microorganisms from proteobacteria related to ce process genera clostridium sensus stricto caproiciproducens and eubacterium affiliated to firmicutes were responsible for ce process angenent et al 2016 kim et al 2015 its abundances increased from 0 17 0 and 0 in original inoculum i e r0 to 1 02 2 59 0 38 1 58 and 1 73e 5 4 9e 4 in ce sludge samples i e r1 r2 and r3 respectively blasting the otus belonged to clostridium sensus stricto caproiciproducens and eubacterium on national central for biotechnology information ncbi database to figure out the species information and the corresponding results were presented in table s5 it can be seen that these matched species all belonged to clostridium sensus stricto but no species belonging to caproiciproducens and eubacterium concretely some of otus belong to clostridium kluyveri identity 99 which was by far the best known species to produce mcfas angenent et al 2016 it was reportedly that the c kluyveri could ferment ethanol and acetate into butanol and hexanol dekishima et al 2011 the relative abundance of c kluyveri was enriched from 0 in r0 initial inoculum to 0 85 in r3 ed ea of 5 1 moreover some of the otus from clostridium sensus stricto were identified to clostridium ljungdahlii identity 94 85 and clostridium autoethanogenum identity 96 93 which were reported to be capable of reducing carboxylates to their responding alcohols perez et al 2013 richter et al 2016 c ljungdahlii enriched from 0 to 0 2 and c autoethanogenum enriched from 0 to 0 53 from r1to r3 these results were accordance with the produced content of lcas which proved both c ljungdahlii and c autoethanogenum might positive correlated with the production of lcas this could reveal what happens in ce process and explain why mcfas and lcas could be co produced from the aspect of microbial community several other genera such as acinetobacter exilispira oscillibacter involved in anaerobic fermentation were also enriched during ce process it was demonstrated that oscillibacter and acinetobacter were positively correlated with the production of mcfas wu et al 2018 their abundances were found to be 0 and 0 in original inoculum i e r0 while 1 69 4 93 and 1 82e 4 5 53e 4 in ce sludge samples i e r1 r2 and r3 respectively till now there is no research of directly performing ce process by these bacteria however the strong correlation between their abundance and ce products production demonstrated that they might be favorable for the ce process when utilizing wasafl as substrate and ethanol as ed in addition the wasafl obtained from stage one containing lots of scfas as ea also worked as the inoculum during stage two its time series shift of key microorganisms associated with scfas production and ce were presented in fig 6 the key microorganisms involved in the scfas production in this system were mainly affiliated to the genera of fonticella sp and proteiniclasticum sp luo et al 2020 yin et al 2018 etc the continuing fermentation time changed the microbial community structures mainly by weakening these scfas producers that their total relative abundance was 1 2 on day 0 r0 then significantly decreased to 0 08 0 37 r1 r3 during day 5 10 due to the rapid enhancement of ce and finally reduced to 0 05 0 35 at the end of the ce experiment 33 day in contrast the extension of ce fermentation time enriched these ce related microbes i e clostridium sensus stricto oscillibacter acinetobacter that the relative abundance significantly increased from 0 55 on day 0 r0 to 15 93 19 4 on day 5 r1 r3 then further increased to 18 24 25 49 on day 10 r1 r3 but finally decreased to 5 42 7 87 on day 33 these results were consistent with the variation of ce performance fig 2 and products production rate fig 4 which clearly proved that the functional microorganisms were shifted in the direction from scfas production to ce process with rapid growth during 0 10 day and then decreased growth afterwards 4 discussion this study confirmed the practicability of using a real wasafl as substrate and ethanol as ed via ce process to achieve the co production of more valuable products i e mcfas and lcas this was experimentally demonstrated in a two stage system consisted of scfas production from alkaline fermentation i e the preparation of real wasafl and ce experiment the two stage system separated the acidification of was and ce processes avoiding the toxicity from both high concentrations of ethanol and generated mcfas on was hydrolysis grootscholten et al 2014 both the scfas production and ce process were guaranteed to operate under their separate optimal conditions as a result abundant of scfas were generated in stage one then the leachate of stage one reacted with ethanol to perform ce obtaining high yield of mcfas and lcas the beneficial of two stage system over single stage system have also been verified by other literatures grootscholten et al separately conducted the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw hydrolysis and ce experiment in two consecutive reactors and the yield of mcfas achieved was almost 5 times that of one stage system with the same substrates grootscholten et al 2014 reddy et al also obtained high caproate production 8 1 g l through the operation of a two stage reactor with food waste as fermentation substrate reddy et al 2018 in stage two the ce results showed that higher ed to ea ratio boosted the co production as well as electron efficiency of mcfas and lcas the maximum mcfas and lcas production was respectively 7 67 0 48 g cod l and 4 21 0 19 g cod l which was achieved at the highest ed to ea ratio of 5 1 meanwhile the total product electron efficiency increased from 59 9 at ed ea ratio of 3 1 to 72 1 at ed ea ratio of 5 1 fig 4b the high ratio of ed to ea was benefited to the production of mcfas which was consistent with previous reports yin et al 2017 reported that within the appropriate concentration range the yield of mcfas mainly caproate increased with the increase of ethanol acetate ratio which possibly due to high ethanol concentration promoted microbial growth similarly lonkar et al 2016 observed that higher alcohol to acid ratio enhanced the mcfas production because of active ce microorganisms and high substrate availability when ethanol concentration was maintained within 5 10 g l however to our present knowledge there is no research concerned on the co production of mcfas and lcas with organic waste as substrate directly theoretically the lcas could be generated via the reduction of their corresponding carboxylic acids or directly through the coa dependent pathway machado et al 2012 richter et al 2016 namely the n butanol and n hexanol could be produced from the reduction of n butyrate and n caproate or the catalyzation of butyryl coa and hexanoyl coa during ce process n butyrate was mainly produced via the combination of butyryl coa with acetate likewise n caproate was produced via the combination of hexanoyl coa with n butyrate spirito et al 2014 consequently no matter which pathway was predominant the production of lcas was mainly related to the content of their corresponding coa substantial acetyl coa could be generated from ethanol at the high ratio of ed to ea angenent et al 2016 liu et al 2016 which provided the sufficient substrate for coa with long carbons resulting in high concentration of lcas surprisingly with the increase of ed ea ratio from 3 1 to 5 1 the proportion of remaining ethanol in the reactor increased from 0 to 25 53 fig 2 meanwhile it can be observed that the concentration of ethanol decreased the slowest after the 10 d in the case of ed ea ratio of 5 1 as compared with other two ed to ea ratios this was likely attributed to the toxicity of the produced undissociated caproate affecting the activity of the ce microorganisms theoretically the dissociation of carboxylic acids was calculated using the formula ph pka lg dissociated carboxylic acid undissociated carboxylic acid when the concentration of produced mcfa is very high and or the environment is at rather acidic condition it is likely to generate undissociated mcfas at the ed ea ratio of 4 1 and 5 1 the concentration of produced mcfas were rather high with a relatively low ph value 5 03 and 4 94 respectively resulting in that the final concentration of undissociated caproate reached up to 0 24 g l and 0 44 g l exceeding the toxicity threshold 0 2 g l on the microorganism liu et al 2017 it could also be therefore understood that there is a large amount of ethanol and butyrate at higher ed ea ratios i e 4 1 and 5 1 but the concentrations of mcfas and lcas cannot continue to increase in the later period of the ce experiment which resulted in the total product production yields table s2 and the maximum total product selectivity not increasing with the increase of ed ea ratios fig 3 moreover the toxic effect of undissociated caproate may also be the reason for the prolonged appearance of the product when the ed ea ratio increased from 3 1 to 5 1 the simulated lag phase time of mcfas and lcas was extended by 1 03 4 47 times fig 4 for instance the n caprylate production time was delayed from the early period to the later period of the ce experiment with the increase of ed ea ratio from 3 1 to 5 1 the co production of mcfas and lcas could be supported by the variations of the decreased scfas producers and enriched functional ce microorganisms such as clostridium kluyveri clostridium ljungdahlii clostridium autoethanogenum oscillibacter and acinetobacter concerned on previous studies with pure or open culture system the above microorganisms were all affirmed as the beneficial microbes to mcfas and lcas production diender et al 2016 richter et al 2016 wu et al 2018 these microorganisms positively related to mcfas and lcas production were all observed the increased relative abundance after ce process indicating that real wasafl obtained in stage one can be utilized directly as ea and inoculum compared to the additional inoculum i e digested sludge used in our previous study it should be noted that the abundance of ce related microbes was highest at 5 10 days due to the adequate substrate supply and then decreased gradually because of the toxicity of produced mcfas which was consistent with the changes of ce performance fig 2 and products production rate fig 4 large amount of previous studies has confirmed that was could be utilized as a recycle resource rather than a waste for example resource recovery through the scfa production of anaerobic fermentation yuan et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 however the low value and high solubility of scfas will inevitably limit the large scale practical application of this method in comparison mcfas and lcas which had higher caloric value and were easier to separate could be processed into many commercial products e g antimicrobial agent animal food additive and fuel precursors etc for engineering application fernández naveira et al 2017 leng et al 2017 in this study the co production of mcfas and lcas using real wasafl simultaneously as ea and inoculum as well as ethanol as ed was fulfilled the products performance and microbial analysis proved that wasafl contained significant ce microbes and could be used directly to produce mcfas and lcas without inoculating exogenous microorganisms meaning the ease of handing procedure and reduction of investment cost a preliminary economic evaluation was conducted based on the results of lab scale test in this study to estimate the potential economic feasibility of the proposed two stage was fermentation technology with increasing mcfas from 5 57 7 67 g cod l and lcas from 2 58 4 21 g cod l co production from two stage was anaerobic fermentation the net economic benefit is estimated to be around 325 67 to 474 71 ton ts table s6 this net benefit arises from the enhanced mcfas and lcas production associated benefit overweighing the additional costs for ethanol and methane inhibitor therefore this novel two stage was fermentation technology for mcfa and lca co production is economically favorable while for reasons concerning economic costs and eco friendly considerations the ethanol source should be obtained sustainably from some organic wastes e g yeast fermentation beer and syngas fermentation effluent or in situ ethanol generation from wastewater in a bio electrochemical system agler et al 2012 vasudevan et al 2014 which might further facilitate the economic feasibility of the proposed technology considering the large amount of was daily generated worldwide the two stage method based on the combined anaerobic fermentation and ce biotechnology reported in this study therefore not only has potentially important significance for high value energy recovery of sludge but also give great support to the long term application of sludge anaerobic fermentation however it should be noted that the produced mcfa i e undissociated caproate could affect the microbial activity in ce system coma et al 2016 affecting the production of mcfas and lcas at high ethanol to wasafl ratio therefore to improve ethanol utilization mcfas and lcas production yields and selectivity as well as shorten lag phase time the product extraction system should be applied in future study to weaken the toxic effect of ce products in addition one of the main purposes was to evaluate the feasibility of co production of mcfas and lcas at high ratio of ed to ea only three ratios of ed to ea i e 3 1 4 1 and 5 1 were performed therefore to obtain the optimal production of mcfas and lcas more and comprehensive ratios of ed to ea should be conducted in the future 5 conclusions the feasibility of achieving the co production of mcfas and lcas using real wasafl simultaneously as ea and inoculum as well as ethanol as ed was comprehensively assessed by ce performance assays in this work the co production of mcfas and lcas was increased with the increase of the carbon molar ratio of ethanol to wasafl but the maximum total product selectivity was achieved at the ed ea ratio of 4 1 due to the high accumulation of n butyrate the kinetic analysis showed the data were well fitted to the modified gompertz equation all the maximal mcfas and lcas production potential and rate as well as lag phase time increased with the increase of ed ea ratio from 3 1 to 5 1 the functional microorganisms were shifted in the direction from scfas production to ce process in the early stage of wasafl fermentation the relative abundances of clostridium kluyveri clostridium ljungdahlii and clostridium autoethanogenum which were positively related to mcfas and lcas production enriched during the ce process indicating that real wasafl can be utilized directly as inoculum declaration of competing

17557,submerged macrophyte monitoring is a major concern for hydrosystem management particularly for understanding and preventing the potential impacts of global change on ecological functions and services macrophyte distribution assessments in rivers are still primarily realized using field monitoring or manual photo interpretation of aerial images considering the lack of applications in fluvial environments developing operational low cost and less time consuming tools able to automatically map and monitor submerged macrophyte distribution is therefore crucial to support effective management programs in this study the suitability of very fine scale resolution 50 cm multispectral pléiades satellite imagery to estimate submerged macrophyte cover at the scale of a 1 km river section was investigated the performance of nonparametric regression methods based on two reliable and well known machine learning algorithms for remote sensing applications random forest and support vector regression were compared for several spectral datasets testing the relevance of 4 spectral bands red green blue and near infrared and two vegetation indices the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the green red vegetation index grvi and for several field sampling configurations both machine learning algorithms applied to a pléiades image were able to reasonably well predict macrophyte cover in river ecosystems with promising performance metrics r² above 0 7 and rmse around 20 the random forest algorithm combined to the 4 spectral bands from pléiades image was the most efficient particularly for extreme cover values 0 and 100 our study also demonstrated that a larger number of fine scale field sampling entities clearly involved better cover predictions than a smaller number of larger sampling entities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquatic vegetation remote sensing machine learning fluvial ecosystem random forest support vector regression 1 introduction the essential role of macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems has been well demonstrated they influence the physical chemical and biological structures of hydrosystems and provide multiple ecosystem functions and services such as water quality improvement stabilization of streambeds and habitat provision carpenter and lodge 1986 dennison et al 1993 jeppesen et al 1998 bornette and puijalon 2011 choi et al 2014 however their excessive development can have negative impacts on hydrosystem functioning for instance light attenuation anoxia reduction of flow velocity and increase of sedimentation e g caraco and cole 2002 hussner et al 2017 kagami et al 2019 modifying biotic interactions and disrupting community assembly santos et al 2011 submerged species especially can also cause recurring problems for users and managers e g inconvenience to water activities olfactory nuisances and clogging of water intakes in power plants in case of uprooting jadhav and buchberger 1995 bunn et al 1998 sand jensen and pedersen 1999 stephan and gutknecht 2002 martin 2017 which are still difficult to fully anticipate on large rivers although it is relatively well known that the patterns of spatial and temporal distribution of aquatic macrophytes result from the interactions between many environmental factors hydrology water temperature light nutrients substrate grazing using these factors in statistical models remains insufficient to predict their distribution within large geographic areas as fluvial environments data on the current distribution of submerged macrophytes in the field are therefore pivotal either for direct monitoring as required by the eu water framework directive to improve the ecological quality assessment of inland waters wfd european commission 2000 but also for developing new distribution models mapping and monitoring vegetation distribution are important technical tasks in sustainable management accordingly numerous monitoring programs have focused on acquiring spatial information about species composition maximum depth colonization density cover i e percentage of the horizontal surface occupied by vegetation biomass and plant height johnson and newman 2011 those programs have been reviewed in stocks et al 2019 in fluvial environment collecting data on submerged aquatic vegetation sav that will sufficiently represent spatial variation along river reach is difficult and requires labour intensive time consuming and sometimes destructive fieldwork thus sav sampling will be more and more replaced by indirect mapping methods especially thanks to remote sensing tools nowadays airborne or satellite sensors provide many observation opportunities at large scales at a given time with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions which are constantly improving actually multispectral satellite data have been widely used to map the distribution of macrophytes over large areas gullström et al 2006 nelson et al 2006 dogan et al 2009 tian et al 2010 and assess the spatio temporal dynamics of aquatic vegetation macalister and mahaxay 2009 zhao et al 2012 2013 however many of these studies have focused on emergent or floating aquatic vegetation due to easier distinction of macrophyte spectral signal from water hyperspectral data have been less considered due to their limitations in terms of cost availability processing and high dimensionality of spectral data plaza et al 2009 adam et al 2010 mutanga et al 2012 recently significant progress has been made in image processing for repetitive and automatic submerged macrophyte mapping over large areas combining punctual field data and various modelling methods some researchers have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of submerged macrophyte mapping using powerful machine learning algorithms e g artificial neural networks random forest support vector machines or k nearest neighbors e g dogan et al 2009 kotta et al 2013 the main characteristic of these supervised algorithms is to train a model on a part of the data and test the fitted model on the other part compared with other nonparametric methods they also have no limitation for the number of independent variables i e adapted to high dimensional data and do not require normally distributed variables most of these works have been conducted in marine environments or were limited to large river basins wetlands or lakes with the best satellite resolution limited to 2 41 m and various attempts have been made to resolve issues regarding submerged vegetation hedley et al 2012 however the insufficient spatial resolution of image data the spatial variability of depth and the strong attenuation of light in water are still limitations for remotely mapping sav in fluvial environments marcus and fonstad 2008 to our knowledge only one study has focused on submerged macrophytes in rivers combining ultra light aircraft images to machine learning algorithms but the obtained map was limited to the presence absence of canopy meadows durand et al 2016 finally a scientific issue is to develop machine learning models on high resolution satellite images with high potential in rivers to extend satellite remote sensing additionally human and financial resources allocated to acquire in situ aquatic vegetation data are generally limited there is no standard sampling protocol while the quality of macrophyte cover prediction depends on the sampling strategy adopted however to our knowledge there is no study in fluvial environments allowing the optimization of sav monitoring methods both in terms of sampling protocol i e determining the spatial scale and the minimal number of sampling plots required and prediction model choice to generate accurate and continuous map of riverine submerged macrophytes in that respect a new mapping method was here investigated to monitor the distribution of submerged vegetation in fluvial environments at a very fine scale resolution 50 cm while limiting logistical financial and human costs the main objective of this study was to develop a cover prediction model combining machine learning algorithm imagery spectral features and punctual field samples in that respect we investigated the performance of two machine learning regression models random forest and support vector regression applied to high resolution multispectral pléiades satellite imagery for automatically mapping macrophyte cover at the scale of a 1 km river section both algorithms are reliable and well known in remote sensing they proved to achieve satisfactory results for various and numerous remote sensing applications in ecology e g cutler et al 2007 hunter et al 2010 husson et al 2017 traganos et al 2018 villa et al 2018 zafari et al 2019 sabat tomala et al 2020 support vector regression is more robust than random forest for a lower sample size but the latter is faster to compute mountrakis et al 2011 belgiu and drăguţ 2016 gholami and fakhari 2017 in addition we discussed several sav cover sampling strategies involving various numbers of sampling entities with different sizes in order to guide managers optimizing their monitoring method we assessed whether for a given sampling effort it is better to use a larger number of smaller sampling entities or a smaller number of larger entities for sav cover estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out during september 2017 in the garonne river a southwest french shallow river approximately 15 km north of toulouse 43 41 51 n 1 22 09 e next to the city of seilh fig 1 a the study area was about 1 km long and 110 m wide and it is a typical example of the mid garonne ecosystems with abundant macrophyte meadows which develop at low water depth from the end of march to early october and which are mainly constituted of submerged species including two dominant species such as myriophyllum spicatum eurasian water milfoil l 1753 and ranunculus fluitans river water crowfoot lam 1779 a dozen of aquatic macrophyte species occur at this site and are observed between 0 15 and 2 m depth the study area is composed of a shallow backwater downstream on the right bank and it is bordered by a pebble bed on its left bank a natural weir marks the upstream limit of the site bedrocks gravels and pebbles are the main substrates and different mixed sediments can be found on half of the study area previous in situ topography measurements during separate fieldwork campaigns combining bathymetric data collected with a single beam echosounder and elevation measurements of the riverbed banks and overflow areas and 2d hydrodynamics simulations were used to determine water levels at the whole site scale during the macrophyte sampling period 2 2 water levels were relatively low with average depths varying between 0 05 and 1 30 m over more than half of the site during this period the downstream zone was deeper varying mainly between 1 30 and 3 50 m and with a maximum depth of 4 05 m on the right side of the central channel 2 2 field data collection field survey of submerged macrophytes was conducted during the second half of september 2017 to get observed data of macrophyte covers at a period with available pléiades images and a non turbid water column numerical simulations based on a sav model indicated that the biomass of macrophytes on this site and at that date was still very close to the peak biomass that occurred during the second half of august unpublished results a total of 55 sampling plots of 9 m² i e 3 m side pvc square frames were distributed all over the study site fig 2 a the sampling protocol focused on homogeneous areas of macrophyte meadows and was orientated in order to sample several combinations of substrate depth and meadow abundance classes it also included numerous open water plots table 1 each plot p was divided into 16 quadrats q of 0 75 m side fig 2b then the total cover i e referring to the cover of all species of sav within each quadrat was estimated by two subaquatic observers a total of 880 quadrats were thus sampled individually finally we averaged the total cover from the 16 quadrats of each plot to get the total cover at the plot scale the purpose here was to compare two field sampling levels the plot level i e 55 plots versus the quadrat level i e 880 quadrats the centre of each sampling plot was geolocated using a portable real time kinematic global positioning system rtk gps receiver emlid reach rs with 3 cm accuracy the rtk gps reference receiver was located on field close to the right river bank of the study area i e 1 km from all sampling plots and free of obstacles to ensure maximum exposure to radiometric signals both rtk gps receivers used gnss signals from gps and glonass satellites all plots were north orientated the geographical information system qgis 2 18 was used to digitize the field data 2 3 remote sensing data acquisition into the garonne river two types of optical measuring instruments were used to acquire remote sensing data unmanned aerial vehicles uav and satellite with high spatial resolutions uav imagery provided an overview of the distribution of submerged macrophytes meadows at the site scale whereas satellite image was used for the development of the automatic mapping method 2 3 1 uav imagery aerial photos were taken mid september 2017 with a phantom 4 pro a drone developed by dji dji shenzhen china we used a flying height of 30 m the along and across track image covers were set to 70 80 the study site was surveyed in three flight blocks of 10 15 min fig 3 a flight missions were programmed with the litchi application software available for android devices flight weather conditions were sunny with light wind at ground level the camera used in this work was a three band red green and blue dji digital camera equipped with a 1 cmos 20 megapixel sensor camera with a focal length of 24 mm and a f number of 2 8 providing an image size of 5472 3648 columns rows fig 3b mosaicking was processed using the commercial software agisoft metashape professional edition saint petersburg russia with a spatial resolution of 1 cm fig 3c georeferencing was performed on qgis 2 18 using seven ground control points which were taken in situ with the rtk gps with a linear transformation and nearest neighbors resampling then a map of the total cover of submerged macrophytes was created on qgis 2 18 by visual interpretation of the orthomosaic at each 3 3 m cell of an overlaid grid this photo interpreted cover map provided a field reference of the study site 2 3 2 satellite imagery one pléiades pan sharpened image of 100 km² surrounding our study site fig 1b was acquired on september 27 2017 thanks to the initiative for space innovative standards isis program that results from a cooperation between airbus defence and space and the french centre national d etudes spatiales cnes pan sharpening resulting from a fusion process corresponds to a multispectral image including 4 spectral bands from the visible red 0 59 0 71 µm green 0 50 0 62 µm blue 0 43 0 55 µm or rgb through the near infrared nir 0 74 0 94 µm with the spatial resolution of panchromatic images i e 50 cm obtained by the pléiades 1a satellites the ortho image was cloud free with minimal glint and corrected from acquisition and terrain off nadir effects by the providers the raw pléiades image was already ortho rectified before delivery with 2 5 m accuracy according to grazzini et al 2013 its georeferencing has been improved using a linear transformation and nearest neighbors resampling this process required 17 ground control points for which 3 cm accuracy gps positions were determined with the rtk gps this process allowed a new planimetric accuracy of the pléiades image of ca 0 35 m then radiometric corrections have included conversion of pixel digital number values encoded on 16 bits to top of atmosphere toa reflectance for each spectral band i e rgb and nir in order to normalize each spectral band in a continuous range between 0 and 1 this process was made using the geosud toa reflectance plugin available on qgis 2 18 finally a vector masque of the riparian area and dewatered banks was used to produce a minor riverbed only image 2 4 modelling macrophyte cover using satellite imagery modelling the relationship between sav cover and its spectral reflectance is essential for automatically mapping macrophytes we used machine learning regression algorithms to predict macrophyte cover from high resolution reflectance data based on pléiades image fig 4 summarizes the main steps of our approach the predictive model was developed using free geomatics and statistics tools such as qgis 2 18 spatial analysis technologies to pre process the remote sensing data and several r libraries such as rgdal randomforest and e1071 to develop the regression models and to generate the predicted distribution maps at the spatial resolution of the pléiades images i e 0 5 m of resolution finally their resolution had been degraded to 3 m resolution for comparison with the photo interpreted cover map i e 3 m 2 4 1 defining predictive variables amongst spectral data the use of red and especially of nir band for submerged macrophyte detection is still debated because of their relatively fast absorption in water fyfe 2003 heege et al 2004 dogan et al 2009 chen et al 2018b however many submerged macrophytes reach the surface during low water period by creating a canopy having stronger contribution to the signal potentially making these two bands suitable for the detection of aquatic vegetation in addition the use of normalized spectral indices could improve prediction models bradley and fleishman 2008 different datasets derived from the pre processed satellite image were therefore used to assess the potential of multispectral bands and vegetation indices to detect submerged macrophytes and to examine the effect of spectral features on the quality of cover prediction the four spectral reflectance datasets were the following i the first dataset was obtained from the pléiades concatenated spectral data from the visible bands red green and blue bands rgb this dataset was referred to as dataset 0 3 variables ii the second dataset dataset 1 combined rgb and near infrared nir bands 4 variables iii the third dataset dataset 2 included two widely used vegetation indices reflecting the characteristic spectral signature of active vegetation the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi nir r nir r and the green red vegetation index grvi g r g r 2 variables according to cho et al 2008 ndvi could only be useful in shallow clear waters 0 5 m depth because of fast absorption of the nir band while grvi using red and green bands decrease less rapidly depending on the depth and could perform better in detecting changes in canopy vegetation motohka et al 2010 chen et al 2018a iv the last dataset dataset 3 included the rgb and nir bands and the two grvi and ndvi indices 6 variables 2 4 2 extraction of reflectance data based on sampling entities our field database was composed of 55 plots or 880 quadrats each of them being characterized by a value of total macrophyte cover expressed in percentage each sampling entity plot or quadrat was composed of a given number n of pixels from the pléiades image each pixel being associated with a reflectance value in several spectral bands or vegetation indices the n values of reflectance of each spectral band are extracted using the extract function from the r raster package then an area weighted average reflectance of the n pixels belonging to each sampling entity was computed 2 4 3 machine learning regression models and sav mapping we tested the performance of two reliable machine learning algorithms to build a regression model that predicts sav cover at the scale of the site the random forest rf and support vector regression svr algorithms for each model the remote sensing variables including vegetation indices for dataset 2 and dataset 3 were treated as independent variables and the total cover was treated as a dependant or response variable detailed reviews of svr and rf in remote sensing can be found in mountrakis et al 2011 and belgiu and drăguţ 2016 respectively regression analysis was carried out on the four datasets and at the two sampling levels plots and quadrats this procedure allows us to assess the effect of the spectral dataset and the relevance of the two field sampling levels we then explored the effects of the number and size of the sampling entities on prediction quality firstly the effect of the sampling scale on cover prediction was addressed by comparing the results obtained using datasets with 55 entities but of different size 0 75 m 1 5 m corresponding to a group of 4 quadrats per plot and 3 m side secondly the number of quadrats was gradually decreased from the initial dataset 880 quadrats by randomly selecting 1 2 4 or 8 quadrat s per plot this random selection of quadrats generated configurations with 55 110 220 or 440 quadrats in addition a subset of the plots was used to get a configuration with 15 and 30 quadrats thanks to an orientated random selection function we ensured that the quadrat selection maintain a similar distribution of macrophyte abundance classes as that of the initial 880 quadrats dataset table 1 the purpose here was to define the minimal number of sampling entities that allowed a satisfactory result this was achieved by a learning curve analysis in total 72 models combining 2 algorithms 4 spectral datasets and 9 field sampling configurations of cover prediction were run and compared with each other in order to determine the best one the key steps of the method are detailed below 2 4 3 1 tuning training and testing the models in the case of a limited number of samples the k fold cross validation technique is recognized as a valuable approach to split samples into k subsets of roughly equal size hastie et al 2009 for a given combination of hyperparameters k 1 partitions are used iteratively k times to train the model and to test it on the remaining partition thus it potentially allows each sample to be used k times for multiple training or testing with the purposes of i improving the learning process fine tuning ii using independent datasets for training and testing and iii limiting overfitting anguita et al 2012 ramezan et al 2019 the final model performance is calculated by averaging the k computed errors for the selected hyperparameters finally the best prediction model corresponds to the model built with hyperparameters which generate the highest validation score i e the lowest generalization error or test error additionally a commonly used method to reduce the variability in chosen parameters and the standard deviation of performance estimates of the tuned model is to run a repeated k fold cross validation named j k fold cross validation moss et al 2018 we therefore used in this study a repeated k fold cross validation i e with k fixed to 10 as is commonly chosen in the literature jung 2017 and we set j to 10 thus in each round a number of sampling entities was randomly selected with 90 used as training data and 10 as test data during the learning step the different combinations of hyperparameter values are examined and tuned for the calibration of the model the combination of values that generate the lowest error on the test set is assumed to be optimal brenning 2012 cracknell and reading 2014 sharma et al 2017 for the rf algorithm the number of regression trees ntree ranged from 25 to 1000 with a step of 25 to test the sensitivity of this parameter the ntree values that yielded the lowest error were selected for each dataset due to conflicting reports in the literature concerning the potential influence of the mtry parameter i e the number of predictive variables on prediction performance cutler et al 2007 strobl et al 2008 the mtry value was tested from 1 to the maximum number of spectral bands for each dataset e g maximum of 6 for dataset 3 concerning the svr algorithm the commonly used gaussian radial basis kernel function rbf was applied given its traditional superior performance compared to other kernels i e linear or polynomial kavzoglu and colkesen 2009 the different parameters ranges were as follows the regularization parameter c i e cost ranged from 0 1 to 1000 by a factor of 10 ɛ was fixed to 0 1 and the width of the rbf kernel function γ ranged from 2 5 to 25 by a factor of 2 predictive variables were standardized 2 4 3 2 model evaluation two statistics were employed to evaluate the quality of the model predictions the coefficient of determination r² which varies between 0 and 1 to account for the goodness of fit between observations and predictions and to define how much variance is explained by the model the root mean squared error rmse to assess the predictive power of the model these statistics were computed at the scale of the field entities as well as the scale of the site using punctual visually estimated covers for the former depending on the configuration tested for instance 55 plots or 880 quadrats and the cover map obtained from drone imagery photointerpretation for the latter however only the metrics computed at the site scale will be discussed here to address the predictive quality of our models difference maps between predicted and observed covers were also computed to pinpoint local prediction errors expressed as cover percentages a difference below or above 0 indicating an underprediction or an overprediction respectively 3 results 3 1 observed macrophyte distribution on the garonne river monospecific and plurispecific meadows were observed in the field sampling entities with high cover values generally included the two dominant species see 2 1 while the remaining species were observed at lower densities except for potamogeton nodosus and the elodea species which were locally abundant notably in the backwater species were distributed according to their ecological requirements flow turbidity table 1 summarizes the distribution of densities according to the adopted field sampling strategy table s1 see supporting information provides the database from field sampling the photointerpretation of the drone mosaic i e the orthomosaic fig 5 a highlighted the spatial distribution of macrophytes and revealed variability in the distribution of macrophyte meadows these were found mainly upstream and halfway along riverbanks but also at the backwater on the right bank overall higher covers were found along the left bank in areas of shallow depths 0 1 1 m especially on mixed substrates lower densities were observed in deeper areas and or on rock bed downstream meadows seemed to be patchier along the left bank rare meadows were present in the centre of the channel bare areas i e with 0 cover were the most represented on the site followed by areas with covers between 1 and 10 especially present along the right bank while areas with covers between 11 and 25 and above 75 were mostly located along the left bank based on this cover distribution and on point biomass measurements at given sampling plots data not shown the total biomass on the site was estimated to be 2 6 t of dry matter for a surface of ca 10 ha 3 2 predicted cover of submerged macrophytes all the machine learning results were analysed in terms of statistical performance and prediction quality difference between predicted and observed covers for each regression model the r² and rmse statistical results as well as the range of the predicted cover values are provided in the supporting information table s2 figures s1 to s4 also group together the whole map results in the supporting information here we focus on the most relevant results 3 2 1 effect of the spectral features analysing the effect of spectral bands on macrophyte cover prediction has shown meaningful differences between the statistical metrics r² and rmse of the different datasets tested regardless of the sampling level i e plot or quadrat considered prediction models built on dataset 2 i e ndvi and grvi obtained the least satisfactory mapping and statistical results regardless of the algorithm or the sampling level the determination coefficients r² i e similarity levels between predicted and photo interpreted covers were of 0 4 0 5 and the prediction errors rmse ranged between 25 and 27 table s2 overall the bare areas i e open water were poorly predicted with important over prediction particularly with the support vector regression svr algorithm cover maps were improved to some extent with the random forest rf algorithm boundaries of macrophyte patches were more clearly distinguished figures s1 s2 moreover the difference cover maps showed under predicted areas particularly for the meadows located along the left and right banks figures s3 s4 in contrast no meaningful difference with respect to the evaluation metrics were found for the models based on the three remaining datasets and using either rf or svr all of them usually indicated high goodness of fit at the study scale r² between 0 62 and 0 75 as well as a good prediction power with a rmse of 21 on average maximum of 24 table s2 however regarding rf a poorer prediction of the bare areas was noticed in case of dataset 0 while the results obtained with datasets 1 and 3 were equivalent see figures s1 s3 and table s2 for details adding nir improved prediction quality in the bare areas particularly at the quadrat sampling level for svr only the maps obtained with datasets 0 and 1 represented relatively well the spatial distribution of macrophyte meadows on the garonne river figure s2 indeed with dataset 3 high densities were better predicted few under prediction errors than with dataset 2 but bare areas still presented considerable over prediction errors differences up to 28 between predicted and observed covers figure s4 furthermore the predictive advantage of adding nir dataset 1 was variable depending on the 2 sampling levels i e plots or quadrats for instance improved results were noticed for models based on dataset 0 involving the 3 bands in the visible and on quadrats this dataset yielded the lowest difference between predicted and observed covers figure s4 for the rest of result analysis we excluded datasets 2 and 3 since they produce models that were poorly predictive and we focused on models based either on rf and involving dataset 1 or on svr and involving datasets 0 and 1 3 2 2 effect of the learning algorithm the two machine learning algorithms tested here and used on our two field datasets 55 plots and 880 quadrats were able to predict the distribution and macrophyte cover on the garonne river reaching a maximum predicted cover value of 100 table 2 whether for plots or quadrats no statistical pattern was highlighted through the comparison of the two algorithms regression models showed high r² oscillating between 0 67 and 0 74 and low prediction errors rmse around 19 21 even if svr models reached slightly higher performance table 2 overall the predicted cover maps reproduced the observed spatial distribution of submerged macrophytes with dense meadows along the left bank over more than half of the site fig 5c and figures s1 s2 nevertheless there were two areas where the cover prediction error remained high differences up to 100 between the predicted and observed covers namely in the backwater area and downstream within the dense meadow located along the left bank where high densities 75 were detected as bare areas these differences were identified by the dark red areas in the difference maps e g fig 5d besides detecting the patchier distributions downstream within the backwater and along the right bank seems to be more or less difficult depending on the algorithm in that respect the prediction accuracy of macrophyte cover along the riverbank in the middle of the study site was lower using the svr algorithm than using the rf algorithm figures s1 s2 in addition a visual comparison between observed and predicted cover data allowed to point at certain characteristics of the regression algorithms see figures s3 s5 in supporting information for details if we focus on results based on svr at the entity scale data were globally noisier especially with important discrepancies for extreme values of cover i e 0 and 100 figure s5 in that respect more prediction errors were observed at these cover densities at the site scale in particular for meadows upstream and within the central channel figure s4 in addition average densities i e those between 25 and 75 of cover were hardly predicted with svr models indeed those areas were often underestimated by this algorithm with differences between predicted and observed cover reaching a maximum of 50 on the other hand the fit of the regression model with the observed covers was better using rf compared to svr fig 5b and figure s5 the different covers seemed globally well predicted by rf with the different classes of macrophyte abundance better discriminated even if the highest covers i e above 90 were often slightly under predicted maximum of difference under 28 finally the bare areas were better represented by this algorithm and in case of over prediction the maximum difference was still limited to 20 particularly along the riverbeds fig 5d consequently the rf algorithm when associated with dataset 1 was considered as the most convincing one for predicting the spatial distribution of submerged macrophyte cover 3 2 3 effect of field sampling strategy 55 plots vs 880 quadrats the comparison of the two sampling levels plots vs quadrats highlighted clear differences between algorithms in their abilities to detect macrophyte patches whatever the algorithm goodness of fits and spatial errors were not notably different between the two sampling entities although a model using 880 quadrats seemed to show performances somewhat higher than those obtained with 55 plots dataset table 2 even if both of these sampling levels predicted a wide range of cover percentages regression models based on quadrats predicted better the largest cover values especially those above 98 table 2 furthermore the limits of the meadow patches seemed less well defined with a model using 55 plots compared to 880 quadrats finally the difference maps revealed that the differences between predicted and observed covers were reduced using 880 quadrats differences less than 20 on average figure s3 consequently although models based on the two field sampling levels were able to distinguish the spatial distribution of meadows considering 880 quadrats instead of 55 plots showed better results overall the best model for macrophyte cover prediction was obtained with rf using nir band 3 4 1 and 3 4 2 and based on field data sampled within 880 quadrats fig 5c however it remains to be seen whether these better performances are due to a finer size and or to more numerous entities 3 2 4 effect of the size of sampling entity the comparison of the models based on 3 different sizes 3 m 1 5 m and 0 75 m side of the sampling entities and with a fixed number of entities n 55 showed very clear differences regarding cover prediction accuracy actually even if no meaningful difference in model metrics r² and rmse could be seen between the different scales the rf model built on sampling entities of 3 m side presented slightly better r² and rmse compared to models using smaller sampling entities r² 0 70 rmse 21 3 table s2 boundaries between the different macrophyte patches were better defined too figure s1 the difference maps also showed the least spatial difference between predicted and observed covers with average differences amounting to 8 in bare areas and 40 within macrophytes meadows spatial differences locally reached 12 in bare areas and 72 within meadows figure s3 models based on quadrats of 0 75 m side showed the worst performances r² 0 62 rmse 23 7 table s2 and poor cover map results with local prediction differences reaching 20 in bare areas and 90 within meadows figure s3 with sampling entities of 1 5 m side results were improved but still worse than a model based on 3 m side sampling entities similar results were also observed with the svr algorithm see figures s2 s4 for details therefore for a limited number of entities n 55 predicting cover using 3 m side entities seemed more appropriate when addressing the spatial patterns of macrophytes however as shown above this sampling strategy was not fully effective for accurate prediction of cover in particular compared to a sampling strategy with more entities 3 2 5 effect of the number of entities analysis of learning curves which described the evaluation metrics of models based on different numbers of quadrats showed that the maximum performance was reached for 110 quadrats and above whatever the spectral dataset and algorithm used fig 6 and see figure s6 in supporting information for the svr results more precisely the r² and rmse remained stable from 110 quadrats for the rf models fig 6 regarding the svr the same observations could be made though the metrics were really stable from 220 quadrats for dataset 1 rgb nir in terms of sampled surface 220 quadrats correspond to 55 entities of 1 5 m side i e 4 grouped quadrats of 0 75 m side each and a 220 quadrats based model has shown to be more performing than a 55 plots based one and a fortiori than a model based on 55 entities of 1 5 m fig 6 and figure s6 consequently for a same sampled surface cover estimate will be better with models involving more but smaller entities than with models using a limited number of larger entities 4 discussion surveying submerged macrophytes using remote sensing is somewhat more difficult than surveying terrestrial vegetation because of water reflectance issues linked to the strong reflection of the water surface and attenuation of light by the water column and the limited spatial resolution of most sensors nelson et al 2006 underwood et al 2006 in this study we developed a new method for automatically mapping the cover of sav on a river section during the peak of biomass this method included very high resolution 50 cm spectral data from pléiades pan sharpened image combined with a machine learning algorithm and an optimized method of macrophyte cover sampling 4 1 developing a remote sensing method for automatic mapping of vegetation cover 4 1 1 choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm the achievement of this remote sensing method did not really depend on the two regression algorithms tested rf and svr between both of them statistical results were similar with only small differences in the predicted cover maps they showed reasonable fitting capacity r² around 0 7 and relatively low prediction errors rmse 25 in fact a correct parameterization of different machine learning algorithms must lead to similar results however fewer local prediction errors were observed for the rf models the spatial boundaries of the meadow located along the right bank were also better defined actually svr is more sensitive to parameter assignment than rf amongst them the choice of the γ parameter which allows optimal data discrimination during the tuning step 2 4 3 that can significantly alter the performance of svr algorithms brown et al 1999 mountrakis et al 2011 additionally the rf algorithm is known to be effective in quickly handling high dimensional data and multicollinearity belgiu and drăguţ 2016 it was thus considered as the most appropriate machine learning algorithm for river macrophyte mapping 4 1 2 determining the best spectral features for models based on the rf algorithm the best predicted results were obtained using datasets combining visible spectral and nir bands vegetation indices such as ndvi and grvi were of no use for cover prediction adding nir to visible spectral bands also seemed to slightly benefit the prediction of low covers but did not systematically improve the quality of the prediction in the areas of higher expected covers the advantage of adding nir depended on the algorithm indeed the use of nir and the indices derived from it ndvi are still widely discussed in the aquatic remote sensing literature because of the large absorption by water of red and even more nir wavelengths e g pegau et al 1997 fyfe 2003 cho et al 2008 silva et al 2008 moreover even if the green wavelengths normally provide greater light penetration in turbid waters green and red regions are considered as the best ones for submerged macrophyte sensing fyfe 2003 han and rundquist 2003 williams et al 2003 pinnel et al 2005 the use of grvi did not yet compensate for the low performance of ndvi in our study besides a study carried out on wetlands has shown that red and nir regions could be saturated beyond a certain biomass density peñuelas et al 1993 mutanga and skidmore 2004 finally chen et al 2018b have clearly demonstrated that nir should only be used in the case of very shallow aquatic environments 1 m depth nir could thus be useful for predicting macrophyte meadows along the riverbanks or when submerged macrophytes form a canopy just below the water surface which is often the case in eutrophic waters at the biomass peak period 4 1 3 optimizing field sampling training sample size also influenced the prediction accuracy of macrophyte cover with a limited number of entities n 55 using 3 m side entities was more effective than using smaller entities indeed as the geolocation of the pléiades image was not perfect it is likely that the small sampling entities did not exactly match with the satellite image in this case increasing the size of the sampling entity would solve this problem and could explain the better results for 3 m side size entities however for the rf and svr regression models based on 55 plots local prediction errors were larger particularly for bare areas than the model based on 880 quadrats for a same surface sampled the latter actually showed the best predictions even if certain areas still presented local under prediction errors in fact the bigger the training dataset the better the algorithm will learn predicted macrophyte meadows were particularly well distributed and when present local prediction errors were the lowest in comparison with other field sampling strategies both meadows along the riverbanks were well defined using a power relationship r² 0 8 between shoot biomass and cover previously established unpublished study see figure s7 in supporting information shoot biomass at the site scale was estimated to 2 3 t of dry matter for 10 ha this is relatively consistent with the shoot biomass derived from photointerpretation i e 2 6 t of dry matter and confirmed the performance of our model machine learning algorithms were also influenced by the number of training data and their distribution into the study site learning curves confirmed that up to 55 quadrats i e entities of 0 75 m side the number of data was insufficient to make valuable predictions considering a higher number of training data particularly in areas where reflectance values were highly fluctuating would improve prediction accuracy by accounting for larger reflectance variability our results showed that for models using 110 and above quadrats predicted cover maps and model statistics were very similar to those based on 880 quadrats the estimates with 220 quadrats were clearly improved in comparison to those obtained using 55 entities with higher sampling surface 1 5 or 3 m side despite an equal or smaller total sampled surface this study revealed the higher performance of sampling numerous even smaller entities this criterion is particularly interesting regarding submerged macrophyte monitoring as the eye estimation of vegetation covers is relatively difficult at a 3 m scale particularly in deep areas due to the difficulty to get an overview of macrophyte cover on such a surface compared to 55 entities of 3 m side i e plots the sampling surface is also reduced by 8 using 110 entities of 0 75 m side i e quadrats even if using numerous smaller entities implies additional time in the field for movements in water and for gps coordinate acquisition this should be largely compensated by the time saved to estimate total cover within entities of smaller size and by handling a more ergonomic sampling accessory i e a smaller pvc frame from our experience the sampling time spent on an entity was almost linearly linked to its surface because of the need to split large entities in smaller sub entities to get accurate cover estimates thus in comparison with 55 plots the overall sampling effort should be significantly reduced when using 110 quadrats while increasing prediction performance consequently for future monitoring campaigns along a river section of 1 km long we recommend estimating cover in 100 to 200 individual quadrats of a surface comprised between 0 5 and 1 m2 which have shown to be optimal to obtain representative macrophyte mapping using pléiades imagery despite our method performing reasonably well macrophyte cover was still underestimated to some extent maximum local difference between predicted and observed cover still reaching 28 and some bare areas were overestimated maximum local difference reaching 22 some studies reviewed in guo et al 2017 have discussed the effect of imbalanced data on the quality of machine learning classification when some field attributes are infrequently present they can be most likely predicted as rare occurrences undiscovered or ignored or assumed as noise or outliers which results to more prediction errors of certain covers ali et al 2005 however as pointed out by visa and ralescu 2005 perfect balanced training data is not a guarantee to improve a classifier performance field sampling has to be representative of the study site petersen et al 2005 therefore regardless of the distribution of our macrophyte abundance classes table 1 it is possible that better balancing the entity numbers particularly for the extreme covers i e 0 and 100 will improve mapping results in future investigations indeed this sampling strategy would include more reflectance variability as it is particularly observed in open water entities 4 2 external factors influencing model quality isolating plant signal from the water column interference is still the main challenge of remote sensing of sav due to the low contrast williams et al 2003 and to the inherent difficulties in interpreting reflectance values of water peñuelas et al 1993 lehmann and lachavanne 1997 numerous studies have revealed that the spectral signal of sav can also be limited by environmental and biological factors such as water depth turbidity transparency distance between vegetation canopies and water surface maritorena et al 1994 han and rundquist 2003 vis et al 2003 dogan et al 2009 liew and chang 2012 for instance local overestimations of low covers were observed in the central channel or downstream of our study site where water flow and depth are high or where suspended matter is highly concentrated with a thick layer of mud on the bottom for future investigations it would be interesting to determine if predictions of macrophyte cover could be improved by including substrate types or measures of water clarity e g secchi depth chlorophyll a content in our models as stated by nelson et al 2006 some of the 12 submerged species in our study site with low height e g elodea canadensis could also be undetected several studies about submerged vegetation mapping have shown that non canopy forming aquatic vegetation species generally lead to more detection errors vis et al 2003 valta hulkkonen et al 2005 wolter et al 2005 it has been reported that sav can be remotely sensed to a maximum depth between 2 m and 3 m han and rundquist 2003 sawaya et al 2003 finally low concentrations of some photosynthetic pigments in plant leaves such as chlorophylls a and b carotene and xanthophylls could also affect the spectral reflectance amongst vegetation kumar et al 2001 5 conclusion our results provided further evidence that macrophyte cover can be reasonably well predicted with automated regression procedures based on machine learning algorithms and a limited number of sampling entities remote sensing of riverine submerged macrophytes by pansharpened pléiades imagery associated to a random forest algorithm appeared to be a viable and valuable tool for estimating biophysical measures such as macrophyte cover at very high spatial resolution 50 cm on a 1 km site on the garonne river performance metrics were promising with r² above 0 7 and prediction error rates around 20 in this paper we provided a new efficient and less time consuming tool for monitoring sav which should help steering environmental management actions such as sav restoration projects or overgrowth management there is a significant opportunity for applying such a promising method to the multi date monitoring of sav in freshwater river environments indeed the monitoring and mapping of macrophyte meadows over a range of spatial and temporal scales are of prime importance in assessing hydrosystem status however rivers are diverse and complex ecosystems with significant variability of physical properties through both space and time future efforts involving detailed bathymetric data light attenuation and water properties may resolve depth related confusion of sav with substrate type and are a prerequisite for multi date vegetation monitoring based on time series images declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

17557,submerged macrophyte monitoring is a major concern for hydrosystem management particularly for understanding and preventing the potential impacts of global change on ecological functions and services macrophyte distribution assessments in rivers are still primarily realized using field monitoring or manual photo interpretation of aerial images considering the lack of applications in fluvial environments developing operational low cost and less time consuming tools able to automatically map and monitor submerged macrophyte distribution is therefore crucial to support effective management programs in this study the suitability of very fine scale resolution 50 cm multispectral pléiades satellite imagery to estimate submerged macrophyte cover at the scale of a 1 km river section was investigated the performance of nonparametric regression methods based on two reliable and well known machine learning algorithms for remote sensing applications random forest and support vector regression were compared for several spectral datasets testing the relevance of 4 spectral bands red green blue and near infrared and two vegetation indices the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the green red vegetation index grvi and for several field sampling configurations both machine learning algorithms applied to a pléiades image were able to reasonably well predict macrophyte cover in river ecosystems with promising performance metrics r² above 0 7 and rmse around 20 the random forest algorithm combined to the 4 spectral bands from pléiades image was the most efficient particularly for extreme cover values 0 and 100 our study also demonstrated that a larger number of fine scale field sampling entities clearly involved better cover predictions than a smaller number of larger sampling entities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aquatic vegetation remote sensing machine learning fluvial ecosystem random forest support vector regression 1 introduction the essential role of macrophytes in freshwater ecosystems has been well demonstrated they influence the physical chemical and biological structures of hydrosystems and provide multiple ecosystem functions and services such as water quality improvement stabilization of streambeds and habitat provision carpenter and lodge 1986 dennison et al 1993 jeppesen et al 1998 bornette and puijalon 2011 choi et al 2014 however their excessive development can have negative impacts on hydrosystem functioning for instance light attenuation anoxia reduction of flow velocity and increase of sedimentation e g caraco and cole 2002 hussner et al 2017 kagami et al 2019 modifying biotic interactions and disrupting community assembly santos et al 2011 submerged species especially

buchberger 1995 bunn et al 1998 sand jensen and pedersen 1999 stephan and gutknecht 2002 martin 2017 which are still difficult to fully anticipate on large rivers although it is relatively well known that the patterns of spatial and temporal distribution of aquatic macrophytes result from the interactions between many environmental factors hydrology water temperature light nutrients substrate grazing using these factors in statistical models remains insufficient to predict their distribution within large geographic areas as fluvial environments data on the current distribution of submerged macrophytes in the field are therefore pivotal either for direct monitoring as required by the eu water framework directive to improve the ecological quality assessment of inland waters wfd european commission 2000 but also for developing new distribution models mapping and monitoring vegetation distribution are important technical tasks in sustainable management accordingly numerous monitoring programs have focused on acquiring spatial information about species composition maximum depth colonization density cover i e percentage of the horizontal surface occupied by vegetation biomass and plant height johnson and newman 2011 those programs have been reviewed in stocks et al 2019 in fluvial environment collecting data on submerged aquatic vegetation sav that will sufficiently represent spatial variation along river reach is difficult and requires labour intensive time consuming and sometimes destructive fieldwork thus sav sampling will be more and more replaced by indirect mapping methods especially thanks to remote sensing tools nowadays airborne or satellite sensors provide many observation opportunities at large scales at a given time with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions which are constantly improving actually multispectral satellite data have been widely used to map the distribution of macrophytes over large areas gullström et al 2006 nelson et al 2006 dogan et al 2009 tian et al 2010 and assess the spatio temporal dynamics of aquatic vegetation macalister and mahaxay 2009 zhao et al 2012 2013 however many of these studies have focused on emergent or floating aquatic vegetation due to easier distinction of macrophyte spectral signal from water hyperspectral data have been less considered due to their limitations in terms of cost availability processing and high dimensionality of spectral data plaza et al 2009 adam et al 2010 mutanga et al 2012 recently significant progress has been made in image processing for repetitive and automatic submerged macrophyte mapping over large areas combining punctual field data and various modelling methods some researchers have clearly demonstrated the feasibility of submerged macrophyte mapping using powerful machine learning algorithms e g artificial neural networks random forest support vector machines or k nearest neighbors e g dogan et al 2009 kotta et al 2013 the main characteristic of these supervised algorithms is to train a model on a part of the data and test the fitted model on the other part compared with other nonparametric methods they also have no limitation for the number of independent variables i e adapted to high dimensional data and do not require normally distributed variables most of these works have been conducted in marine environments or were limited to large river basins wetlands or lakes with the best satellite resolution limited to 2 41 m and various attempts have been made to resolve issues regarding submerged vegetation hedley et al 2012 however the insufficient spatial resolution of image data the spatial variability of depth and the strong attenuation of light in water are still limitations for remotely mapping sav in fluvial environments marcus and fonstad 2008 to our knowledge only one study has focused on submerged macrophytes in rivers combining ultra light aircraft images to machine learning algorithms but the obtained map was limited to the presence absence of canopy meadows durand et al 2016 finally a scientific issue is to develop machine learning models on high resolution satellite images with high potential in rivers to extend satellite remote sensing additionally human and financial resources allocated to acquire in situ aquatic vegetation data are generally limited there is no standard sampling protocol while the quality of macrophyte cover prediction depends on the sampling strategy adopted however to our knowledge there is no study in fluvial environments allowing the optimization of sav monitoring methods both in terms of sampling protocol i e determining the spatial scale and the minimal number of sampling plots required and prediction model choice to generate accurate and continuous map of riverine submerged macrophytes in that respect a new mapping method was here investigated to monitor the distribution of submerged vegetation in fluvial environments at a very fine scale resolution 50 cm while limiting logistical financial and human costs the main objective of this study was to develop a cover prediction model combining machine learning algorithm imagery spectral features and punctual field samples in that respect we investigated the performance of two machine learning regression models random forest and support vector regression applied to high resolution multispectral pléiades satellite imagery for automatically mapping macrophyte cover at the scale of a 1 km river section both algorithms are reliable and well known in remote sensing they proved to achieve satisfactory results for various and numerous remote sensing applications in ecology e g cutler et al 2007 hunter et al 2010 husson et al 2017 traganos et al 2018 villa et al 2018

drăguţ 2016 gholami and fakhari 2017 in addition we discussed several sav cover sampling strategies involving various numbers of sampling entities with different sizes in order to guide managers optimizing their monitoring method we assessed whether for a given sampling effort it is better to use a larger number of smaller sampling entities or a smaller number of larger entities for sav cover estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out during september 2017 in the garonne river a southwest french shallow river approximately 15 km north of toulouse 43 41 51 n 1 22 09 e next to the city of seilh fig 1 a the study area was about 1 km long and 110 m wide and it is a typical example of the mid garonne ecosystems with abundant macrophyte meadows which develop at low water depth from the end of march to early october and which are mainly constituted of submerged species including two dominant species such as myriophyllum spicatum eurasian water milfoil l 1753 and ranunculus fluitans river water crowfoot lam 1779 a dozen of aquatic macrophyte species occur at this site and are observed between 0 15 and 2 m depth the study area is composed of a shallow backwater downstream on the right bank and it is bordered by a pebble bed on its left bank a natural weir marks the upstream limit of the site bedrocks gravels and pebbles are the main substrates and different mixed sediments can be found on half of the study area previous in situ topography measurements during separate fieldwork campaigns combining bathymetric data collected with a single beam echosounder and elevation measurements of the riverbed banks and overflow areas and 2d hydrodynamics simulations were used to determine water levels at the whole site scale during the macrophyte sampling period 2 2 water levels were relatively low with average depths varying between 0 05 and 1 30 m over more than half of the site during this period the downstream zone was deeper varying mainly between 1 30 and 3 50 m and with a maximum depth of 4 05 m on the right side of the central channel 2 2 field data collection field survey of submerged macrophytes was conducted during the second half of september 2017 to get observed data of macrophyte covers at a period with available pléiades images and a non turbid water column numerical simulations based on a sav model indicated that the biomass of macrophytes on this site and at that date was still very close to the peak biomass that occurred during the second half of august unpublished results a total of 55 sampling plots of 9 m² i e 3 m side pvc square frames were distributed all over the study site fig 2 a the sampling protocol focused on homogeneous areas of macrophyte meadows and was orientated in order to sample several combinations of substrate depth and meadow abundance classes it also included numerous open water plots table 1 each plot p was divided into 16 quadrats q of 0 75 m side fig 2b then the total cover i e referring to the cover of all species of sav within each quadrat was estimated by two subaquatic observers a total of 880 quadrats were thus sampled individually finally we averaged the total cover from the 16 quadrats of each plot to get the total cover at the plot scale the purpose here was to compare two field sampling levels the plot level i e 55 plots versus the quadrat level i e 880 quadrats the centre of each sampling plot was geolocated using a portable real time kinematic global positioning system rtk gps receiver emlid reach rs with 3 cm accuracy the rtk gps reference receiver was located on field close to the right river bank of the study area i e 1 km from all sampling plots and free of obstacles to ensure maximum exposure to radiometric signals both rtk gps receivers used gnss signals from gps and glonass satellites all plots were north orientated the geographical information system qgis 2 18 was used to digitize the field data 2 3 remote sensing data acquisition into the garonne river two types of optical measuring instruments were used to acquire remote sensing data unmanned aerial vehicles uav and satellite with high spatial resolutions uav imagery provided an overview of the distribution of submerged macrophytes meadows at the site scale whereas satellite image was used for the development of the automatic mapping method 2 3 1 uav imagery aerial photos were taken mid september 2017 with a phantom 4 pro a drone developed by dji dji shenzhen china we used a flying height of 30 m the along and across track image covers were set to 70 80 the study site was surveyed in three flight blocks of 10 15 min fig 3 a flight missions were programmed with the litchi application software available for android devices flight weather conditions were sunny with light wind at ground level the camera used in this work was a three band red green and blue dji digital camera equipped with a 1 cmos 20 megapixel sensor camera with a focal length of 24 mm and a f number of 2 8 providing an image size of 5472 3648 columns rows fig 3b mosaicking was processed using the commercial software agisoft metashape professional edition saint petersburg russia with a spatial resolution of 1 cm fig 3c georeferencing was performed on qgis 2 18 using seven ground control points which were taken in situ with the rtk gps with a linear transformation and nearest neighbors resampling then a map of the total cover of submerged macrophytes was created on qgis 2 18 by visual interpretation of the orthomosaic at each 3 3 m cell of an overlaid grid this photo interpreted cover map provided a field reference of the study site 2 3 2 satellite imagery one pléiades pan sharpened image of 100 km² surrounding our study site fig 1b was acquired on september 27 2017 thanks to the initiative for space innovative standards isis program that results from a cooperation between airbus defence and space and the french centre national d etudes spatiales cnes pan sharpening resulting from a fusion process corresponds to a multispectral image including 4 spectral bands from the visible red 0 59 0 71 µm green 0 50 0 62 µm blue 0 43 0 55 µm or rgb through the near infrared nir 0 74 0 94 µm with the spatial resolution of panchromatic images i e 50 cm obtained by the pléiades 1a satellites the ortho image was cloud free with minimal glint and corrected from acquisition and terrain off nadir effects by the providers the raw pléiades image was already ortho rectified before delivery with 2 5 m accuracy according to grazzini et al 2013 its georeferencing has been improved using a linear transformation and nearest neighbors resampling this process required 17 ground control points for which 3 cm accuracy gps positions were determined with the rtk gps this process allowed a new planimetric accuracy of the pléiades image of ca 0 35 m then radiometric corrections have included conversion of pixel digital number values encoded on 16 bits to top of atmosphere toa reflectance for each spectral band i e rgb and nir in order to normalize each spectral band in a continuous range between 0 and 1 this process was made using the geosud toa reflectance plugin available on qgis 2 18 finally a vector masque of the riparian area and dewatered banks was used to produce a minor riverbed only image 2 4 modelling macrophyte cover using satellite imagery modelling the relationship between sav cover and its spectral reflectance is essential for automatically mapping macrophytes we used machine learning regression algorithms to predict macrophyte cover from high resolution reflectance data based on pléiades image fig 4 summarizes the main steps of our approach the predictive model was developed using free geomatics and statistics tools such as qgis 2 18 spatial analysis technologies to pre process the remote sensing data and several r libraries such as rgdal randomforest and e1071 to develop the regression models and to generate the predicted distribution maps at the spatial resolution of the pléiades images i e 0 5 m of resolution finally their resolution had been degraded to 3 m resolution for comparison with the photo interpreted cover map i e 3 m 2 4 1 defining predictive variables amongst spectral data the use of red and especially of nir band for submerged macrophyte detection is still debated because of their relatively fast absorption in water fyfe 2003 heege et al 2004 dogan et al 2009 chen et al 2018b however many submerged macrophytes reach the surface during low water period by creating a canopy having stronger contribution to the signal potentially making these two bands suitable for the detection of aquatic vegetation in addition the use of normalized spectral indices could improve prediction models bradley and fleishman 2008 different datasets derived from the pre processed satellite image were therefore used to assess the potential of multispectral bands and vegetation indices to detect submerged macrophytes and to examine the effect of spectral features on the quality of cover prediction the four spectral reflectance datasets were the following i the first dataset was obtained from the pléiades concatenated spectral data from the visible bands red green and blue bands rgb this dataset was referred to as dataset 0 3 variables ii the second dataset dataset 1 combined rgb and near infrared nir bands 4 variables iii the third dataset dataset 2 included two widely used vegetation indices reflecting the characteristic spectral signature of active vegetation the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi nir r nir r and the green red vegetation index grvi g r g r 2 variables according to cho et al 2008 ndvi could only be useful in shallow clear waters 0 5 m depth because of fast absorption of the nir band while grvi using red and green bands decrease less rapidly depending on the depth and could perform better in detecting changes in canopy vegetation motohka et al 2010 chen et al 2018a iv the last dataset dataset 3 included the rgb and nir bands and the two grvi and ndvi indices 6 variables 2 4 2 extraction of reflectance data based on sampling entities our field database was composed of 55 plots or 880 quadrats each of them being characterized by a value of total macrophyte cover expressed in percentage each sampling entity plot or quadrat was composed of a given number n of pixels from the pléiades image each pixel being associated with a reflectance value in several spectral bands or vegetation indices the n values of reflectance of each spectral band are extracted using the extract function from the r raster package then an area weighted average reflectance of the n pixels belonging to each sampling entity was computed 2 4 3 machine learning regression models and sav mapping we tested the performance of two reliable machine learning algorithms to build a regression model that predicts sav cover at the scale of the site the random forest rf and support vector regression svr algorithms for each model the remote sensing variables including vegetation indices for dataset 2 and dataset 3 were treated as independent variables and the total cover was treated as a dependant or response variable detailed reviews of svr and rf in remote sensing can be found in mountrakis et al 2011 and belgiu and drăguţ 2016 respectively regression analysis was carried out on the four datasets and at the two sampling levels plots and quadrats this procedure allows us to assess the effect of the spectral dataset and the relevance of the two field sampling levels we then explored the effects of the number and size of the sampling entities on prediction quality firstly the effect of the sampling scale on cover prediction was addressed by comparing the results obtained using datasets with 55 entities but of different size 0 75 m 1 5 m corresponding to a group of 4 quadrats per plot and 3 m side secondly the number of quadrats was gradually decreased from the initial dataset 880 quadrats by randomly selecting 1 2 4 or 8 quadrat s per plot this random selection of quadrats generated configurations with 55 110 220 or 440 quadrats in addition a subset of the plots was used to get a configuration with 15 and 30 quadrats thanks to an orientated random selection function we ensured that the quadrat selection maintain a similar distribution of macrophyte abundance classes as that of the initial 880 quadrats dataset table 1 the purpose here was to define the minimal number of sampling entities that allowed a satisfactory result this was achieved by a learning curve analysis in total 72 models combining 2 algorithms 4 spectral datasets and 9 field sampling configurations of cover prediction were run and compared with each other in order to determine the best one the key steps of the method are detailed below 2 4 3 1 tuning training and testing the models in the case of a limited number of samples the k fold cross validation technique is recognized as a valuable approach to split samples into k subsets of roughly equal size hastie et al 2009 for a given combination of hyperparameters k 1 partitions are used iteratively k times to train the model and to test it on the remaining partition thus it potentially allows each sample to be used k times for multiple training or testing with the purposes of i improving the learning process fine tuning ii using independent datasets for training and testing and iii limiting overfitting anguita et al 2012 ramezan et al 2019 the final model performance is calculated by averaging the k computed errors for the selected hyperparameters finally the best prediction model corresponds to the model built with hyperparameters which generate the highest validation score i e the lowest generalization error or test error additionally a commonly used method to reduce the variability in chosen parameters and the standard deviation of performance estimates of the tuned model is to run a repeated k fold cross validation named j k fold cross validation moss et al 2018 we therefore used in this study a repeated k fold cross validation i e with k fixed to 10 as is commonly chosen in the literature jung 2017 and we set j to 10 thus in each round a number of sampling entities was randomly selected with 90 used as training data and 10 as test data during the learning step the different combinations of hyperparameter values are examined and tuned for the calibration of the model the combination of values that generate the lowest error on the test set is assumed to be optimal brenning 2012 cracknell and reading 2014 sharma et al 2017 for the rf algorithm the number of regression trees ntree ranged from 25 to 1000 with a step of 25 to test the sensitivity of this parameter the ntree values that yielded the lowest error were selected for each dataset due to conflicting reports in the literature concerning the potential influence of the mtry parameter i e the number of predictive variables on prediction performance cutler et al 2007 strobl et al 2008 the mtry value was tested from 1 to the maximum number of spectral bands for each dataset e g maximum of 6 for dataset 3 concerning the svr algorithm the commonly used gaussian radial basis kernel function rbf was applied given its traditional superior performance compared to other kernels i e linear or polynomial kavzoglu and colkesen 2009 the different parameters ranges were as follows the regularization parameter c i e cost ranged from 0 1 to 1000 by a factor of 10 ɛ was fixed to 0 1 and the width of the rbf kernel function γ ranged from 2 5 to 25 by a factor of 2 predictive variables were standardized 2 4 3 2 model evaluation two statistics were employed to evaluate the quality of the model predictions the coefficient of determination r² which varies between 0 and 1 to account for the goodness of fit between observations and predictions and to define how much variance is explained by the model the root mean squared error rmse to assess the predictive power of the model these statistics were computed at the scale of the field entities as well as the scale of the site using punctual visually estimated covers for the former depending on the configuration tested for instance 55 plots or 880 quadrats and the cover map obtained from drone imagery photointerpretation for the latter however only the metrics computed at the site scale will be discussed here to address the predictive quality of our models difference maps between predicted and observed covers were also computed to pinpoint local prediction errors expressed as cover percentages a difference below or above 0 indicating an underprediction or an overprediction respectively 3 results 3 1 observed macrophyte distribution on the garonne river monospecific and plurispecific meadows were observed in the field sampling entities with high cover values generally included the two dominant species see 2 1 while the remaining species were observed at lower densities except for potamogeton nodosus and the elodea species which were locally abundant notably in the backwater species were distributed according to their ecological requirements flow turbidity table 1 summarizes the distribution of densities according to the adopted field sampling strategy table s1 see supporting information provides the database from field sampling the photointerpretation of the drone mosaic i e the orthomosaic fig 5 a highlighted the spatial distribution of macrophytes and revealed variability in the distribution of macrophyte meadows these were found mainly upstream and halfway along riverbanks but also at the backwater on the right bank overall higher covers were found along the left bank in areas of shallow depths 0 1 1 m especially on mixed substrates lower densities were observed in deeper areas and or on rock bed downstream meadows seemed to be patchier along the left bank rare meadows were present in the centre of the channel bare areas i e with 0 cover were the most represented on the site followed by areas with covers between 1 and 10 especially present along the right bank while areas with covers between 11 and 25 and above 75 were mostly located along the left bank based on this cover distribution and on point biomass measurements at given sampling plots data not shown the total biomass on the site was estimated to be 2 6 t of dry matter for a surface of ca 10 ha 3 2 predicted cover of submerged macrophytes all the machine learning results were analysed in terms of statistical performance and prediction quality difference between predicted and observed covers for each regression model the r² and rmse statistical results as well as the range of the predicted cover values are provided in the supporting information table s2 figures s1 to s4 also group together the whole map results in the supporting information here we focus on the most relevant results 3 2 1 effect of the spectral features analysing the effect of spectral bands on macrophyte cover prediction has shown meaningful differences between the statistical metrics r² and rmse of the different datasets tested regardless of the sampling level i e plot or quadrat considered prediction models built on dataset 2 i e ndvi and grvi obtained the least satisfactory mapping and statistical results regardless of the algorithm or the sampling level the determination coefficients r² i e similarity levels between predicted and photo interpreted covers were of 0 4 0 5 and the prediction errors rmse ranged between 25 and 27 table s2 overall the bare areas i e open water were poorly predicted with important over prediction particularly with the support vector regression svr algorithm cover maps were improved to some extent with the random forest rf algorithm boundaries of macrophyte patches were more clearly distinguished figures s1 s2 moreover the difference cover maps showed under predicted areas particularly for the meadows located along the left and right banks figures s3 s4 in contrast no meaningful difference with respect to the evaluation metrics were found for the models based on the three remaining datasets and using either rf or svr all of them usually indicated high goodness of fit at the study scale r² between 0 62 and 0 75 as well as a good prediction power with a rmse of 21 on average maximum of 24 table s2 however regarding rf a poorer prediction of the bare areas was noticed in case of dataset 0 while the results obtained with datasets 1 and 3 were equivalent see figures s1 s3 and table s2 for details adding nir improved prediction quality in the bare areas particularly at the quadrat sampling level for svr only the maps obtained with datasets 0 and 1 represented relatively well the spatial distribution of macrophyte meadows on the garonne river figure s2 indeed with dataset 3 high densities were better predicted few under prediction errors than with dataset 2 but bare areas still presented considerable over prediction errors differences up to 28 between predicted and observed covers figure s4 furthermore the predictive advantage of adding nir dataset 1 was variable depending on the 2 sampling levels i e plots or quadrats for instance improved results were noticed for models based on dataset 0 involving the 3 bands in the visible and on quadrats this dataset yielded the lowest difference between predicted and observed covers figure s4 for the rest of result analysis we excluded datasets 2 and 3 since they produce models that were poorly predictive and we focused on models based either on rf and involving dataset 1 or on svr and involving datasets 0 and 1 3 2 2 effect of the learning algorithm the two machine learning algorithms tested here and used on our two field datasets 55 plots and 880 quadrats were able to predict the distribution and macrophyte cover on the garonne river reaching a maximum predicted cover value of 100 table 2 whether for plots or quadrats no statistical pattern was highlighted through the comparison of the two algorithms regression models showed high r² oscillating between 0 67 and 0 74 and low prediction errors rmse around 19 21 even if svr models reached slightly higher performance table 2 overall the predicted cover maps reproduced the observed spatial distribution of submerged macrophytes with dense meadows along the left bank over more than half of the site fig 5c and figures s1 s2 nevertheless there were two areas where the cover prediction error remained high differences up to 100 between the predicted and observed covers namely in the backwater area and downstream within the dense meadow located along the left bank where high densities 75 were detected as bare areas these differences were identified by the dark red areas in the difference maps e g fig 5d besides detecting the patchier distributions downstream within the backwater and along the right bank seems to be more or less difficult depending on the algorithm in that respect the prediction accuracy of macrophyte cover along the riverbank in the middle of the study site was lower using the svr algorithm than using the rf algorithm figures s1 s2 in addition a visual comparison between observed and predicted cover data allowed to point at certain characteristics of the regression algorithms see figures s3 s5 in supporting information for details if we focus on results based on svr at the entity scale data were globally noisier especially with important discrepancies for extreme values of cover i e 0 and 100 figure s5 in that respect more prediction errors were observed at these cover densities at the site scale in particular for meadows upstream and within the central channel figure s4 in addition average densities i e those between 25 and 75 of cover were hardly predicted with svr models indeed those areas were often underestimated by this algorithm with differences between predicted and observed cover reaching a maximum of 50 on the other hand the fit of the regression model with the observed covers was better using rf compared to svr fig 5b and figure s5 the different covers seemed globally well predicted by rf with the different classes of macrophyte abundance better discriminated even if the highest covers i e above 90 were often slightly under predicted maximum of difference under 28 finally the bare areas were better represented by this algorithm and in case of over prediction the maximum difference was still limited to 20 particularly along the riverbeds fig 5d consequently the rf algorithm when associated with dataset 1 was considered as the most convincing one for predicting the spatial distribution of submerged macrophyte cover 3 2 3 effect of field sampling strategy 55 plots vs 880 quadrats the comparison of the two sampling levels plots vs quadrats highlighted clear differences between algorithms in their abilities to detect macrophyte patches whatever the algorithm goodness of fits and spatial errors were not notably different between the two sampling entities although a model using 880 quadrats seemed to show performances somewhat higher than those obtained with 55 plots dataset table 2 even if both of these sampling levels predicted a wide range of cover percentages regression models based on quadrats predicted better the largest cover values especially those above 98 table 2 furthermore the limits of the meadow patches seemed less well defined with a model using 55 plots compared to 880 quadrats finally the difference maps revealed that the differences between predicted and observed covers were reduced using 880 quadrats differences less than 20 on average figure s3 consequently although models based on the two field sampling levels were able to distinguish the spatial distribution of meadows considering 880 quadrats instead of 55 plots showed better results overall the best model for macrophyte cover prediction was obtained with rf using nir band 3 4 1 and 3 4 2 and based on field data sampled within 880 quadrats fig 5c however it remains to be seen whether these better performances are due to a finer size and or to more numerous entities 3 2 4 effect of the size of sampling entity the comparison of the models based on 3 different sizes 3 m 1 5 m and 0 75 m side of the sampling entities and with a fixed number of entities n 55 showed very clear differences regarding cover prediction accuracy actually even if no meaningful difference in model metrics r² and rmse could be seen between the different scales the rf model built on sampling entities of 3 m side presented slightly better r² and rmse compared to models using smaller sampling entities r² 0 70 rmse 21 3 table s2 boundaries between the different macrophyte patches were better defined too figure s1 the difference maps also showed the least spatial difference between predicted and observed covers with average differences amounting to 8 in bare areas and 40 within macrophytes meadows spatial differences locally reached 12 in bare areas and 72 within meadows figure s3 models based on quadrats of 0 75 m side showed the worst performances r² 0 62 rmse 23 7 table s2 and poor cover map results with local prediction differences reaching 20 in bare areas and 90 within meadows figure s3 with sampling entities of 1 5 m side results were improved but still worse than a model based on 3 m side sampling entities similar results were also observed with the svr algorithm see figures s2 s4 for details therefore for a limited number of entities n 55 predicting cover using 3 m side entities seemed more appropriate when addressing the spatial patterns of macrophytes however as shown above this sampling strategy was not fully effective for accurate prediction of cover in particular compared to a sampling strategy with more entities 3 2 5 effect of the number of entities analysis of learning curves which described the evaluation metrics of models based on different numbers of quadrats showed that the maximum performance was reached for 110 quadrats and above whatever the spectral dataset and algorithm used fig 6 and see figure s6 in supporting information for the svr results more precisely the r² and rmse remained stable from 110 quadrats for the rf models fig 6 regarding the svr the same observations could be made though the metrics were really stable from 220 quadrats for dataset 1 rgb nir in terms of sampled surface 220 quadrats correspond to 55 entities of 1 5 m side i e 4 grouped quadrats of 0 75 m side each and a 220 quadrats based model has shown to be more performing than a 55 plots based one and a fortiori than a model based on 55 entities of 1 5 m fig 6 and figure s6 consequently for a same sampled surface cover estimate will be better with models involving more but smaller entities than with models using a limited number of larger entities 4 discussion surveying submerged macrophytes using remote sensing is somewhat more difficult than surveying terrestrial vegetation because of water reflectance issues linked to the strong reflection of the water surface and attenuation of light by the water column and the limited spatial resolution of most sensors nelson et al 2006 underwood et al 2006 in this study we developed a new method for automatically mapping the cover of sav on a river section during the peak of biomass this method included very high resolution 50 cm spectral data from pléiades pan sharpened image combined with a machine learning algorithm and an optimized method of macrophyte cover sampling 4 1 developing a remote sensing method for automatic mapping of vegetation cover 4 1 1 choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm the achievement of this remote sensing method did not really depend on the two regression algorithms tested rf and svr between both of them statistical results were similar with only small differences in the predicted cover maps they showed reasonable fitting capacity r² around 0 7 and relatively low prediction errors rmse 25 in fact a correct parameterization of different machine learning algorithms must lead to similar results however fewer local prediction errors were observed for the rf models the spatial boundaries of the meadow located along the right bank were also better defined actually svr is more sensitive to parameter assignment than rf amongst them the choice of the γ parameter which allows optimal data discrimination during the tuning step 2 4 3 that can significantly alter the performance of svr algorithms brown et al 1999 mountrakis et al 2011 additionally the rf algorithm is known to be effective in quickly handling high dimensional data and multicollinearity belgiu and drăguţ 2016 it was thus considered as the most appropriate machine learning algorithm for river macrophyte mapping 4 1 2 determining the best spectral features for models based on the rf algorithm the best predicted results were obtained using datasets combining visible spectral and nir bands vegetation indices such as ndvi and grvi were of no use for cover prediction adding nir to visible spectral bands also seemed to slightly benefit the prediction of low covers but did not systematically improve the quality of the prediction in the areas of higher expected covers the advantage of adding nir depended on the algorithm indeed the use of nir and the indices derived from it ndvi are still widely discussed in the aquatic remote sensing literature because of the large absorption by water of red and even more nir wavelengths e g pegau et al 1997 fyfe 2003 cho et al 2008 silva et al 2008 moreover even if the green wavelengths normally provide greater light penetration in turbid waters green and red regions are considered as the best ones for submerged macrophyte sensing fyfe 2003 han and rundquist 2003 williams et al 2003 pinnel et al 2005 the use of grvi did not yet compensate for the low performance of ndvi in our study besides a study carried out on wetlands has shown that red and nir regions could be saturated beyond a certain biomass density peñuelas et al 1993 mutanga and skidmore 2004 finally chen et al 2018b have clearly demonstrated that nir should only be used in the case of very shallow aquatic environments 1 m depth nir could thus be useful for predicting macrophyte meadows along the riverbanks or when submerged macrophytes form a canopy just below the water surface which is often the case in eutrophic waters at the biomass peak period 4 1 3 optimizing field sampling training sample size also influenced the prediction accuracy of macrophyte cover with a limited number of entities n 55 using 3 m side entities was more effective than using smaller entities indeed as the geolocation of the pléiades image was not perfect it is likely that the small sampling entities did not exactly match with the satellite image in this case increasing the size of the sampling entity would solve this problem and could explain the better results for 3 m side size entities however for the rf and svr regression models based on 55 plots local prediction errors were larger particularly for bare areas than the model based on 880 quadrats for a same surface sampled the latter actually showed the best predictions even if certain areas still presented local under prediction errors in fact the bigger the training dataset the better the algorithm will learn predicted macrophyte meadows were particularly well distributed and when present local prediction errors were the lowest in comparison with other field sampling strategies both meadows along the riverbanks were well defined using a power relationship r² 0 8 between shoot biomass and cover previously established unpublished study see figure s7 in supporting information shoot biomass at the site scale was estimated to 2 3 t of dry matter for 10 ha this is relatively consistent with the shoot biomass derived from photointerpretation i e 2 6 t of dry matter and confirmed the performance of our model machine learning algorithms were also influenced by the number of training data and their distribution into the study site learning curves confirmed that up to 55 quadrats i e entities of 0 75 m side the number of data was insufficient to make valuable predictions considering a higher number of training data particularly in areas where reflectance values were highly fluctuating would improve prediction accuracy by accounting for larger reflectance variability our results showed that for models using 110 and above quadrats predicted cover maps and model statistics were very similar to those based on 880 quadrats the estimates with 220 quadrats were clearly improved in comparison to those obtained using 55 entities with higher sampling surface 1 5 or 3 m side despite an equal or smaller total sampled surface this study revealed the higher performance of sampling numerous even smaller entities this criterion is particularly interesting regarding submerged macrophyte monitoring as the eye estimation of vegetation covers is relatively difficult at a 3 m scale particularly in deep areas due to the difficulty to get an overview of macrophyte cover on such a surface compared to 55 entities of 3 m side i e plots the sampling surface is also reduced by 8 using 110 entities of 0 75 m side i e quadrats even if using numerous smaller entities implies additional time in the field for movements in water and for gps coordinate acquisition this should be largely compensated by the time saved to estimate total cover within entities of smaller size and by handling a more ergonomic sampling accessory i e a smaller pvc frame from our experience the sampling time spent on an entity was almost linearly linked to its surface because of the need to split large entities in smaller sub entities to get accurate cover estimates thus in comparison with 55 plots the overall sampling effort should be significantly reduced when using 110 quadrats while increasing prediction performance consequently for future monitoring campaigns along a river section of 1 km long we recommend estimating cover in 100 to 200 individual quadrats of a surface comprised between 0 5 and 1 m2 which have shown to be optimal to obtain representative macrophyte mapping using pléiades imagery despite our method performing reasonably well macrophyte cover was still underestimated to some extent maximum local difference between predicted and observed cover still reaching 28 and some bare areas were overestimated maximum local difference reaching 22 some studies reviewed in guo et al 2017 have discussed the effect of imbalanced data on the quality of machine learning classification when some field attributes are infrequently present they can be most likely predicted as rare occurrences undiscovered or ignored or assumed as noise or outliers which results to more prediction errors of certain covers ali et al 2005 however as pointed out by visa and ralescu 2005 perfect balanced training data is not a guarantee to improve a classifier performance field sampling has to be representative of the study site petersen et al 2005 therefore regardless of the distribution of our macrophyte abundance classes table 1 it is possible that better balancing the entity numbers particularly for the extreme covers i e 0 and 100 will improve mapping results in future investigations indeed this sampling strategy would include more reflectance variability as it is particularly observed in open water entities 4 2 external factors influencing model quality isolating plant signal from the water column interference is still the main challenge of remote sensing of sav due to the low contrast williams et al 2003 and to the inherent difficulties in interpreting reflectance values of water peñuelas et al 1993 lehmann and lachavanne 1997 numerous studies have revealed that the spectral signal of sav can also be limited by environmental and biological factors such as water depth turbidity transparency distance between vegetation canopies and water surface maritorena et al 1994 han and rundquist 2003 vis et al 2003 dogan et al 2009 liew and chang 2012 for instance local overestimations of low covers were observed in the central channel or downstream of our study site where water flow and depth are high or where suspended matter is highly concentrated with a thick layer of mud on the bottom for future investigations it would be interesting to determine if predictions of macrophyte cover could be improved by including substrate types or measures of water clarity e g secchi depth chlorophyll a content in our models as stated by nelson et al 2006 some of the 12 submerged species in our study site with low height e g elodea canadensis could also be undetected several studies about submerged vegetation mapping have shown that non canopy forming aquatic vegetation species generally lead to more detection errors vis et al 2003 valta hulkkonen et al 2005 wolter et al 2005 it has been reported that sav can be remotely sensed to a maximum depth between 2 m and 3 m han and rundquist 2003 sawaya et al 2003 finally low concentrations of some photosynthetic pigments in plant leaves such as chlorophylls a and b carotene and xanthophylls could also affect the spectral reflectance amongst vegetation kumar et al 2001 5 conclusion our results provided further evidence that macrophyte cover can be reasonably well predicted with automated regression procedures based on machine learning algorithms and a limited number of sampling entities remote sensing of riverine submerged macrophytes by pansharpened pléiades imagery associated to a random forest algorithm appeared to be a viable and valuable tool for estimating biophysical measures such as macrophyte cover at very high spatial resolution 50 cm on a 1 km site on the garonne river performance metrics were promising with r² above 0 7 and prediction error rates around 20 in this paper we provided a new efficient and less time consuming tool for monitoring sav which should help steering environmental management actions such as sav restoration projects or overgrowth management there is a significant opportunity for applying such a promising method to the multi date monitoring of sav in freshwater river environments indeed the monitoring and mapping of macrophyte meadows over a range of spatial and temporal scales are of prime importance in assessing hydrosystem status however rivers are diverse and complex ecosystems with significant variability of physical properties through both space and time future efforts involving detailed bathymetric data light attenuation and water properties may resolve depth related confusion of sav with substrate type and are a prerequisite for

17558,the quantity and composition of nutrients carried by rivers play an important role in maintaining the ecosystem of downstream rivers and marginal seas to reveal the impact of damming on the composition and flux changes of nutrients in rivers this study conducted a detailed survey of a large sub tropical reservoir xinanjiang reservoir xajr in eastern china from august 2013 to june 2014 obtaining samples at bi monthly intervals the thermal stratification water quality in situ parameters and the contents of nutrients in the water column of the river inflow transition area central reservoir area and discharge water of the xajr were analyzed in detail along the fluvial direction the results show that the thermal stratification of the xajr had seasonal and spatial heterogeneity accordingly the ph and dissolved oxygen saturation degree in water also showed a similar stratification phenomenon the analysis of nutrient limitation for primary productivity indicated that in different seasons varying limiting degrees of the silicon or phosphorus were developed in different locations along the xajr river system among them the river area and transition area were more susceptible to silicon restriction in winter whereas phosphorus restriction mainly occurred during the warm seasons from april to october xajr had a retention effect on nitrogen phosphorus and silicon among which phosphorus was more easily retained by the reservoir in addition nitrogen underwent transformation processes between different forms inside the reservoir in the reservoir the different degrees of retention effect of nutrients also led to a significant increase in the ratio of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus in the discharged water this study confirmed that thermal stratification has important control over the contents and forms of nutrients in water this finding provided an idea for the restoration of the fluxes and stoichiometric ratios of the nutrients in the downstream river using the reservoir s capacity for artificial regulation graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrients xinanjiang reservoir retention effects thermal stratification 1 introduction rivers are important channels connecting terrestrial and marine ecosystems annually global rivers transport large amounts of biogenic materials to the ocean which are of great significance in maintaining the health and sustainability of ecosystems in marginal seas friedl and wüest 2002 humborg et al 1997 jiao et al 2007 turner et al 1998 therefore monitoring materials carried by rivers has always been an important scientific task however in the past few decades increased human activities have greatly changed the fluvial flux and forms of river nutrients increasing industrial and agricultural activities as well as large scale river impounding are considered to be the main factors causing the changes in river material flux among them the impact of dam retention on the transport of river nutrients has become a critical issue in academic context in recent years dos santos et al 2020 friedl et al 2004 huang et al 2019 humborg et al 2006 humborg et al 2008 koiv et al 2011 liu et al 2019 lu et al 2016 maavara et al 2014 matzinger et al 2007 nemery et al 2016 pozdnyakov et al 2019 teodoru et al 2006a wang et al 2010 wang et al 2014 after impounding the flow velocity of a river decreases and the transparency of the water body of the reservoir increases significantly this is conducive to the development of phytoplankton increasing the photosynthesis of water bodies gradually friedl and wüest 2002 matzinger et al 2007 correspondingly along the fluvial direction aquatic ecosystems have gradually shifted from river heterotrophic to lake autotrophic dominant han et al 2018 huang et al 2019 in addition with the increase in water level seasonal thermal stratification often develops along the water column of the reservoir this phenomenon has also led to the development of the biological and chemical stratification of the water column matzinger et al 2007 teodoru et al 2006b wang et al 2010 for example during the thermal stratification of a reservoir over saturation of dissolved oxygen do and high ph values are often observed in the epilimnion due to strong photosynthesis in contrast due to the barrier effect of thermal stratification there is a lack of convection exchange between the upper and lower waters this often leads to hypoxia and low ph in deep water taleb et al 2004 wang et al 2015a in the reservoir river system the differences in the major biogeochemical processes in the direction of river flow and water column have an important impact on the absorption and transformation of river nutrients kelly 2001 liu et al 2019 maavara et al 2015 milliman 1997 paul 2003 putz and benndorf 1998 teodoru et al 2006a another important factor that significantly impacts the downstream transport of river nutrients is the fact that hydroelectric reservoirs usually use bottom drainage to generate electricity this often leads to important differences in the concentrations and forms of nutrients in the inlet and outlet of the reservoir these factors on the one hand destroy the water quality continuity of rivers and bring about negative effects on the regional water environment quality on the other hand changes in the output fluxes and forms of river nutrients also have a potential impact on the primary productivity structure of estuaries and marginal sea areas humborg et al 1997 humborg et al 2000 jiao et al 2007 latrubesse et al 2017 currently approximately 70 of the world s rivers are intercepted by dams kummu and varis 2007 and the global active storage capacity of reservoirs has grown from approximately 200 to over 5000 km3 during the past fifty years which is over 70 of the total global reservoir capacity 7000 8000 km3 vorosmarty et al 1997 zhou et al 2016 certainly this has a major impact on the fluvial flux of nutrients into the sea from global rivers the estimates indicate that due to the retention of reservoirs nutrients from rivers globally have been retained in large quantities for example on a global scale the retention of dissolved silicon dsi in lakes and reservoirs is 163 gmol yr 1 9 8 tgyr 1 maavara et al 2014 total p tp trapped in the global reservoirs was estimated to be 42 gmol yr 1 and the retention of reactive p was 18 gmol yr 1 in the year 2000 it is expected that by 2030 as more dams are built 17 of the tp load of global rivers will be trapped by reservoirs maavara et al 2015 therefore the retention of nutrients and the transformation of their forms in reservoirs are important issues facing the current inland water environment and marginal sea ecosystems understanding the impact of large reservoirs on the nutrient cycle of rivers has important global significance and has practical significance in regional water environment quality protection large reservoirs play a pivotal role in the development of water resources and hydropower in river basins this type of reservoir is significantly different from small reservoirs in terms of hydrological retention time storage capacity and regulating capacity therefore large reservoirs may cause greater disturbances to river water environments in contrast many studies in the past have paid more attention to the retention effect of dams on substances transported by rivers and there is a lack of in depth understanding of the conversion process of nutrients in reservoirs as well as the main controlling mechanism a detailed study on the latter will help improve the water quality of the downstream area as well as the reservoir itself by using the reservoir s regulating capacity in this study a large reservoir in the qiantang river basin in eastern china xinanjiang reservoir xajr was selected for a detailed investigation this reservoir has the characteristics of a long hydrological retention time huge storage capacity and strong regulating capacity it is a typical large scale water conservancy project in a subtropical area through a detailed investigation of the cycling of nutrients in the xajr river system this study focused on the following objectives 1 to reveal the transformation of nutrient contents and forms in rivers by large reservoirs and 2 to elaborate the major controlling factors that affect the nutrient cycling in the reservoir 2 study area and methodology 2 1 studied reservoir and sampling the xinanjiang reservoir e118 42 e118 59 n29 28 n29 58 located in chun an county zhejiang province was constructed in 1959 it is also known as qiandao lake fig 1 it has a surface area of 567 km2 with mean and maximum water depths of 34 m and 117 m respectively the drainage area of the xajr is 10442 km2 and the recharge coefficient is 18 2 the normal water level of this reservoir is 108 m corresponding to a reservoir volume of 17 84 billion m3 the minimum water level is 86 m with a storage capacity of 7 57 billion m3 the climate is typically a subtropical monsoon climate with air temperatures ranging from 5 c to 36 c annual average value of 17 c and annual precipitation of 1429 9 mm on average the air humidity here is approximately 76 and the forest coverage rate of the drainage area reaches 83 wang et al 2015b the area around xajr is a hilly landform the local geology consists of a large amount of sedimentary rocks and shallow metamorphic rocks as well as some volcanic eruptive rocks and intrusive rocks the soil in this area is mainly yellow earth and red earth in this study from august 2013 to june 2014 water samples along the fluvial direction of the xajr were collected at bimonthly sampling intervals fig 1 due to the shallow depth in the incoming river area of the reservoir only surface and bottom water samples were collected moreover four or five layers of water were collected depending on water depth along the water column in the central reservoir during the high water level seasons the sampling intervals were 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m and 45 m in low water level seasons the intervals were 0 m 10 m 20 m and 35 m the discharge from the dam was only collected 0 5 m underwater because of the mixing temperature t ph and do were measured in situ with a portable ph and conductivity meter ysi 6600v2 to determine the dissolved nutrients water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm polycarbonate membrane immediately after sampling and stored in 100 ml plastic bottles on ice in a cooler until analysis for tn and tp water samples were directly stored in 100 ml plastic bottles and h2so4 was added to keep the ph 2 for the tp and tn determinations water samples were first digested in a drb200 digestion instrument hach company and then measured using a dr3900 spectrophotometer hach company the concentrations of dissolved silicon dsi dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din including no3 no2 and nh4 were measured using an automated flow injection analyzer skalar sans plus systems the analytical errors were less than 5 2 2 calculation the thermal stratification index s s δt taverage where δt is the temperature difference between the surface and bottom water taverage is the average temperature of the water column the variation rate of nutrient concentration in and out of the reservoir v v 100 cinflow coutflow cinflow cinflow is the concentration of nutrients in the inflow of the reservoir coutflow is the concentration of nutrients in the discharge of the reservoir if the value of v is positive the reservoir has a retention effect on the nutrients and if the v value is negative the reservoir has increased the nutrient concentration in its discharge 3 results 3 1 longitudinal variations in water temperature ph do and their seasonal stratification after the impounding of the reservoir as the water level rises seasonal stratification of varying degrees usually develops along the water column water temperature is the most direct indicator of water mixing as shown in fig 2 seasonal water quality stratification especially in summer appeared in the xajr however in winter the water column was completely mixed february was the coldest season in the study area affected by the temperature drop the water column of the reservoir was well mixed with a very small difference in water temperature between the surface and the bottom on the contrary along the direction of river flow the water temperature of the inflow river was low however an approximately 5 c higher water temperature was found in discharge from the dam similar to the distribution pattern of water temperature in february ph and do saturation did not show stratification along the water column indicating good mixing in the vertical direction however along the direction of flow the ph and do saturation of the inflow river were slightly higher than that of the discharge from the dam in august a clear stratification of water quality was developed in the xajr fig 2 contrary to february the variation in surface water temperature was small along the direction of flow in august but there was a clear thermal stratification along the water column in the central reservoir area near the dam the temperature difference between the surface and bottom water reached 20 c this also led to a low water temperature 19 4 c downstream of the dam due to the bottom water discharge for hydropower generation compared with the inflow river the discharge from the dam was 10 c lower furthermore ph is an important water quality indicator similar to thermal stratification the ph along the water column in the reservoir also showed apparent stratification the ph difference between the surface and the bottom water in the central reservoir area reached 2 4 whereas the ph downstream of the dam was 1 7 units lower than that of the inflow river in the same way the stratification of the do saturation degree was also developed in the xajr due to the influence of thermal stratification there was a lack of exchange between the upper and lower water bodies which results in the do of the lower water not being replenished therefore the do saturation of the lower water body decreased significantly for example the do saturation of the surface water in the central reservoir area reached 130 whereas in the hypolimnion the do could be less than 50 in august this indicates that photosynthesis in the epilimnion was enhanced whereas the hypolimnion was mainly controlled by the process of oxygen consumption compared with the inflow river entering the reservoir the downstream dam had a lower do saturation this is mainly due to the deep water discharge in general affected by the seasonal stratification of water quality and bottom water discharge from the dam the xinanjiang reservoir presented seasonal water quality discontinuities in the direction of river flow 3 2 longitudinal variations in nutrients 3 2 1 longitudinal variations in tn and tp tn and tp are important parameters in water quality and are also the obligatory indicators for evaluating the trophic level of water bodies throughout the year tn concentrations in the xajr river system had large variations achieving a maximum value of more than 300 μμ and a minimum value below 10 μμ the average value was 106 62 μμ along the fluvial direction the tn concentration showed a gradually decreasing trend from the upstream area of the river toward the dam after passing the dam the tn concentration further decreased fig 3 it is worth noting that the tn concentration varied greatly along the water columns at the river reservoir transition area and the central reservoir in august and october this is related to the thermal stratification and transformation of different forms of nitrogen in the water column for example in october tn ranged from 21 4 to 314 μμ in the water column near the dam with the maximum appearing in the 5 m depth however in the cold seasons tn content changed little in the vertical direction but showed a trend of gradually decreasing along the river channel similar to the variations in tn the tp concentration also showed a trend of gradually decreasing from the inflow river to downstream of the dam fig 3 throughout the year the variation range of tp concentrations was smaller than that of tn with a minimum value of 1 24 μm surface water at site 06 in june a maximum value of 14 μm bottom water at site 02 in april and an average value of 3 84 2 4 μm compared with other months the tp concentrations in december changed greatly in the water column but changed relatively little in the direction of river flow in other months except at individual sites the tp concentrations in the water in the study area gradually decreased in the downstream direction but changed slightly in the vertical direction 3 2 2 longitudinal variations in dissolved nutrients changes in the concentration of dissolved nutrients directly respond to the quality of the water environment the dsi concentration of xajr ranged from 5 17 to 211 μm with an average annual value of 70 44 μm the dsi concentration was lower in winter and higher in summer fig 4 this is due to the dsi absorption by diatom reproduction in winter and the enhancement of chemical weathering in summer which results in a large amount of dsi being brought into the reservoir during the thermal stratification in warm seasons the dsi concentration in the reservoir also changed greatly along the water column fig 4 that is the dsi concentration of the surface water was much lower than that of the bottom water and the difference could reach more than 10 times that amount such as at site 06 in june in cold seasons as the thermal stratification disappeared the dsi concentration along the water column tended to be consistent similar to the changes in the water column the dsi concentration also had seasonal variations along the river channel during the thermal stratification period the dsi concentration generally showed a gradual decrease from the inflow river to the downstream although it had a lower value at site 01 fig 4 in the cold seasons the longitudinal variations of the dsi concentration became smaller during this period the dsi concentration in the transition area of the reservoir was relatively low this may be related to the absorption of diatoms in this area fig 4 in xajr nitrate is the main component of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din compared to dsi the concentration of nitrate changed little throughout the year with a minimum value of 35 7 μμ a maximum value of 150 μμ and an average value of 78 22 μμ unlike dsi nitrate showed large changes along the water column and direction of river flow fig 4 which indicated that nitrate has a strong transformation process in the river reservoir system for example although the water depth at the inflow river area was shallow less than 10 m nitrate concentrations except august also had large changes in the water column compared with the cold seasons during the thermal stratification in the warm seasons the concentration of nitrate in the reservoir changed more in the water columns along the direction of river flow the concentration of nitrate gradually decreased in february april and june however in august october and december this trend was less pronounced for freshwater systems dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip is usually the limiting factor for aquatic primary productivity therefore the concentration of dip is highly susceptible to biological processes in water unlike dsi and nitrate the concentration of dip in the study area was very low fig 4 the concentration range of dip was 0 21 5 1 μm and the annual average value was 1 31 0 96 μm in general the dip concentration varied greatly in the vertical direction of the inflow river area and the river reservoir transition zone but had less variation along the water column profile in the central reservoir area similar to the trend of tp the concentration of dip gradually decreased along the direction of river flow which reflected the gradual absorption process of dip in the reservoir of note the variations in dip concentration in october were unique on the one hand compared with other months the dip concentration was lower in october on the other hand there was little change in the water column and direction of river flow this might be related to the impounding process of the reservoir in autumn 3 3 analysis of stoichiometric ratio of nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and silicon are important nutrients for maintaining the primary productivity of water bodies generally for freshwater systems the activity of nitrogen is high in contrast nitrogen fertilizer application and atmospheric nitrogen deposition have been greatly strengthened in the past few decades which makes nitrogen more adequate in water than silicon and phosphorus therefore according to the redfield ratio nitrogen generally does not constitute a restrictive condition for primary productivity in rivers on the contrary because the artificial input of silicon is very small and phosphorus is easily adsorbed by particulate matter under the influence of biological absorption inland waters often exhibit the phenomenon of silicon limitation or phosphorus limitation this is consistent with the nutrient limitation of the water body in the study area at different time and space scales various levels of silicon or phosphorus restricting were developed in the xajr river system fig 5 in terms of space silicon restrictive conditions for the growth of phytoplankton appeared in the areas of river inflow and the river reservoir transition area fig 5a in terms of time december and february were the main periods when silicon restrictions appeared fig 5b therefore according to fig 5a and b it was found that the inflow river area and the transition area were prone to silicon restriction in winter in other regions and other seasons dsi was not a limiting condition for phytoplankton growth in contrast to silicon restriction in the warm seasons growth seasons from april to october phosphorus restriction occurred in the central reservoir area downstream of the dam and some transition areas fig 5c d during the non growth season december and february there was generally no phosphorus restriction condition in the inflow river area or the transition area in general along the river channel the water body in the study area changed from the silicon restriction type in the river area to the phosphorus restriction type in the reservoir area silicon restriction mainly occurred in the cold seasons and phosphorus restriction occurred mainly in the warm seasons 3 4 retention effect of nutrients after the reservoir is impounded with the development of physical and chemical stratification inside the reservoir and the discharge manner from the dam reservoir the water quality of the river appears discontinuous in the direction of flow by comparing the differences in water quality parameters between the input river and the discharge from the dam it was found that after passing through the reservoir the concentrations of nutrients in the river had changed to varying degrees temperature ph and do saturation of the discharged water showed a decreasing trend with an average annual variation rate of 26 11 3 and 11 1 respectively the temperature of the discharge from the dam was only higher than that of the inflow river in winter fig 6 a the dsi concentration of the discharged water was higher than that of the inflow river during october and december and its variation rate was negative close to 95 in other months the variation rates of dsi were positive the concentrations of tn tp and dip in the discharged water were lower than those of the inflow river indicating that these nutrients have significant retention effects in the reservoir fig 6b at the annual average level the variation rates of tn and dip were higher reaching 50 3 and 54 3 respectively followed by tp and dsi with rates of 27 9 and 23 3 respectively as the major form of din nitrate had a variation rate of 33 27 with an annual average rate of only 6 6 fig 6c this might be related to the high do level in the xajr which also indicated that this reservoir had a limited retention effect on nitrate in contrast nitrite and ammonia had large variation rates both showed that the concentrations in the discharge water were significantly lower than those in the incoming river throughout the year the annual average variation rates of nitrite and ammonia were 81 5 and 95 5 respectively which also led to a higher annual average rate of din fig 6c changes in nutrient concentrations and forms have an important effect on the stoichiometric ratio of nutrients in the discharged water as shown in fig 6d the annual average variation rate of silicon to nitrogen ratio was the smallest 6 whereas the ratios of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus in the discharged water increased significantly with variation rates of 94 and 72 respectively this also revealed that phosphorus is more likely to be retained in the reservoir than nitrogen and silicon the variation rate of the tn to tp ratio was 20 4 discussion 4 1 influence of thermal stratification on do and ph the thermal stratification state represents the stability of the layered structure of the water column the higher the thermal stratification index δt t average the weaker the exchange between the upper and lower water bodies of the reservoir the more stable the layered structure and conversely the better the water mixing in the vertical direction affected by the strong hydrodynamics the water body of the inflow river was well mixed and the thermal stratification index remained low throughout the year as the transition area of the reservoir has both the characteristics of the natural river and large lake the water body in this area showed weak seasonal stratification due to the weak hydrodynamics in the central reservoir area seasonal thermal stratification was well developed with a high thermal stratification index during the warm seasons the differences in seasonal thermal stratification intensity in different areas of large reservoirs had an important impact on water quality after entering the reservoir the flow velocity of the river gradually slows down which is conducive to the development of seasonal thermal stratification in warm seasons however with the weakening of the hydrodynamics the thickness of the euphotic layer increased promoting the enhancement of photosynthesis in the epilimnion especially in the growing seasons strong photosynthesis results in a significant increase in do saturation degree and ph in the epilimnion of the reservoir aviles and niell 2007 han et al 2018 in the xajr the variations in the water quality parameters do and ph of the epilimnion showed a dependence on the intensity of thermal stratification fig 7 a b this reflects the controlling effect of thermal stratification on the development of the lake autotrophic process 4 2 effect of thermal stratification on nutrient cycling generally similar to most freshwater systems duan et al 2007 perez et al 2011 turner et al 2003 wang et al 2018 nitrogen did not constitute the limiting factor of primary productivity in the xajr the main limiting factor was phosphorus during the winter most of the river reservoir transition area except site 01 in february was in the state of silicon limitation fig 5a b the increase in the thermal stratification index means that the stability of the water body improved and the photosynthesis of the water body will be enhanced therefore the absorption of phosphorus by phytoplankton is intensified leading to a decrease in dip concentration in the euphotic layer in fig 7c the thermal stratification index of the xajr had a negative logarithmic relationship with the dip concentration in the epilimnion this indicates that the thermal stratification of the water body has an important control effect on the photosynthesis of the water body fig 7a b further determining the concentration change of dip unlike dip only in winter dsi became the limiting factor for primary productivity at the inflow river and transition areas this is due to the influence of algae s competitive advantage diatoms are more suitable for growing in cold seasons and areas with strong hydrodynamics conley et al 1993 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2014 as a result in the river and transition areas the dsi concentration of the epilimnion and the thermal stratification index showed a positive correlation fig 7d which indicated that in these areas diatoms are more likely to grow in winter without thermal stratification leading to the occurrence of silicon restriction fig 5 as seasonal thermal stratification developed gradually these areas were gradually dominated by other non diatom phytoplankton sendra et al 2019 varol 2019 owing to the weak hydrodynamics in the central reservoir area it is difficult for diatoms to form dominant populations therefore dsi did not constitute a limiting factor in the central reservoir area and was not constrained by thermal stratification fig 7d accordingly the si n and si p ratios of the surface water were affected by the thermal stratification of the water body only in the river and transition areas fig 7e f in addition to seasonal thermal stratification other factors also affected the nutrient cycling process in the reservoir correlation analysis of the water quality parameters of all water samples showed that there were different degrees of coupling among nutrients table 1 nitrate had a significant negative correlation with water temperature which indicated that the higher the water temperature the greater the rate of absorption and conversion of nitrate during the period of thermal stratification the saturation degree of do in the deep water of reservoirs was usually low friedl and wüest 2002 wang et al 2018 which is conducive to the occurrence of denitrification processes cubas et al 2019 fadhullah et al 2020 liu et al 2011 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 accordingly there was a positive correlation between nitrate and nitrite in addition nitrite also had a significant positive correlation with ammonia indicating that the nitrification process existed 4 3 nutrient cycle in reservoir and its environmental impact the changes in a river after impounding are mainly reflected in the seasonal thermal stratification of reservoirs and the further derived chemical and biological stratification han et al 2018 liu et al 2017 under the combined effects of the biogeochemical cycle in the reservoir and bottom water discharge in a hydropower reservoir nutrients downstream of the dam are quite different in forms and concentrations from those in the inflow river kelly 2001 matzinger et al 2007 in fig 8 the major geochemical cycling processes of nutrients in the river reservoir system are outlined during the period of thermal stratification after entering the reservoir particulate matter such as particulate organic matter and inorganic suspended matter carried by the river gradually settle which also leads to the accumulation of tp and tn in the sediment the hydrodynamic condition of the transition area is weaker than that of the inflow river area and stronger than that of the central reservoir and therefore weak seasonal thermal stratification is formed however the transition area inherits a large amount of nutrients from upstream inputs as a result diatom growth is favored leading to the absorption of dissolved nitrogen phosphorus and silicon due to weak hydrodynamics seasonal thermal stratification is well developed in the central reservoir area fig 2 the growth of phytoplankton in this area is limited by the level of nutrient supply especially the dip fig 5 on the vertical profile of the reservoir part of the newly formed organic matter is degraded in the upper layer of water and the dissolved nutrients are released to the water body again restricted by thermal stratification and the consumption of do in the water column the deep water of large reservoirs often shows seasonal do scarcity bellanger et al 2004 han et al 2018 the decomposition of organic matter settled from the upper water is therefore accompanied by the denitrification process which also leads to the nitrification process due to the upward migration of the reduced nitrogen component fig 8 consequently nitrification and denitrification processes are often associated with adjacent water layers liu et al 2011 wang et al 2019 reservoir sediment is an important sink of exogenous organic matter imported from rivers autogenous organic matter and nutrients it is also the main place for the anaerobic degradation of organic matter and nutrient mineralization re releasing nutrients such as nh4 dsi and dip to the overlying water body the water intake of a hydropower reservoir is usually located near the dead storage level which is conducive to the downstream transport of mineralized nutrients from the deep water of the reservoir the seasonal thermal stratification of large reservoirs biogeochemical cycle processes inside reservoirs and special deep water discharge mode from dams greatly impact the environmental quality of the river 1 compared with that of inflow water at the annual average level temperature ph and do of the discharge water from the dam are reduced fig 6a this may have an adverse effect on the growth of organisms in the downstream channel for example after the construction of a dam upstream of the colorado river the growth rate of the clams downstream significantly changed schone et al 2003 similarly the hydrological regulation of reservoirs also caused the changes in the downstream biodiversity and ecological anomalies in the estuary area jiao et al 2007 power et al 1996 2 according to the average annual variation rates of tn tp dsi dip and din fig 6b c large reservoirs have an important effect on the retention of these nutrients among them the retention of dsi will have an important impact on the normal growth of diatoms in downstream water and even in the estuary area humborg et al 1997 humborg et al 2008 huang et al 2019 ran et al 2013 wang et al 2010 3 in addition to the reduction in the concentration of nutrients transported downstream the stoichiometric ratio of nutrients in the discharge from the dam such as the important increase of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus ratio also changes greatly 5 conclusions xajr is a typical large reservoir which is the type of reservoir very important and representative in the cascade development of hydropower in drainage basins based on the systematic investigation of the thermal stratification and the variations in nutrient concentrations in the xajr the influence mechanism of large reservoirs on the nutrient cycle of the river was clarified it was found that the thermal stratification of large reservoirs has evident seasonal characteristics from the direction of river flow the thermal stratification increases gradually from the inflow river to the central reservoir do ph and dip concentrations in the epilimnion are all dependent on thermal stratification indicating that thermal stratification has an important effect on photosynthesis intensity dissolved silicon and phosphorus are the main limiting factors of primary productivity among them silicon limitation mainly occurred in cold seasons in the inflow river and transition area of large reservoirs whereas the limiting effect of phosphorus occurred mainly in the growing seasons large reservoirs have important retention effects on nitrogen phosphorus and silicon of which the retention rate of nitrate is low and that of dip is high the difference in the retention efficiency of different nutrients in the reservoir also leads to great changes in the stoichiometric ratio of the nutrients in the discharge water from the reservoir among them the ratio of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus increased significantly which is

17558,the quantity and composition of nutrients carried by rivers play an important role in maintaining the ecosystem of downstream rivers and marginal seas to reveal the impact of damming on the composition and flux changes of nutrients in rivers this study conducted a detailed survey of a large sub tropical reservoir xinanjiang reservoir xajr in eastern china from august 2013 to june 2014 obtaining samples at bi monthly intervals the thermal stratification water quality in situ parameters and the contents of nutrients in the water column of the river inflow transition area central reservoir area and discharge water of the xajr were analyzed in detail along the fluvial direction the results show that the thermal stratification of the xajr had seasonal and spatial heterogeneity accordingly the ph and dissolved oxygen saturation degree in water also showed a similar stratification phenomenon the analysis of nutrient limitation for primary productivity indicated that in different seasons varying limiting degrees of the silicon or phosphorus were developed in different locations along the xajr river system among them the river area and transition area were more susceptible to silicon restriction in winter whereas phosphorus restriction mainly occurred during the warm seasons from april to october xajr had a retention effect on nitrogen phosphorus and silicon among which phosphorus was more easily retained by the reservoir in addition nitrogen underwent transformation processes between different forms inside the reservoir in the reservoir the different degrees of retention effect of nutrients also led to a significant increase in the ratio of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus in the discharged water this study confirmed that thermal stratification has important control over the contents and forms of nutrients in water this finding provided an idea for the restoration of the fluxes and stoichiometric ratios of the nutrients in the downstream river using the reservoir s capacity for artificial regulation graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrients xinanjiang reservoir retention effects thermal stratification 1 introduction rivers are important channels connecting terrestrial and marine ecosystems annually global rivers transport large amounts of biogenic materials to the ocean which are of great significance in maintaining the health and sustainability of ecosystems in marginal seas friedl and wüest 2002 humborg et al 1997 jiao et al 2007 turner et al 1998 therefore monitoring materials carried by rivers has always been an important scientific task however in the past few decades increased human activities have greatly changed the fluvial flux and forms of river nutrients increasing industrial and agricultural activities as well as large scale river impounding are considered to be the main factors causing the changes in river material flux among them the impact of dam retention on the transport of river nutrients has become a critical issue in academic context in recent years dos santos et al 2020 friedl et al 2004 huang et al 2019 humborg et al 2006 humborg et al 2008 koiv et al 2011 liu et al 2019 lu et al 2016 maavara et al 2014 matzinger et al 2007 nemery et al 2016 pozdnyakov et al 2019 teodoru et al 2006a wang et al 2010 wang et al 2014 after impounding the flow velocity of a river decreases and the transparency of the water body of the reservoir increases significantly this is conducive to the development of phytoplankton increasing the photosynthesis of water bodies gradually friedl and wüest 2002 matzinger et al 2007 correspondingly along the fluvial direction aquatic ecosystems have gradually shifted from river heterotrophic to lake autotrophic dominant han et al 2018 huang et al 2019 in addition with the increase in water level seasonal thermal stratification often develops along the water column of the reservoir this phenomenon has also led to the development of the biological and chemical stratification of the water column matzinger et al 2007 teodoru et al 2006b wang et al 2010 for example during the thermal stratification of a reservoir over saturation of dissolved oxygen do and high ph values are often observed in the epilimnion due to strong photosynthesis in contrast due to the barrier effect of thermal stratification there is a lack of convection exchange between the upper and lower waters this often leads to hypoxia and low ph in deep water taleb et al 2004 wang et al 2015a in the reservoir river system the differences in the major biogeochemical processes in the direction of river flow and water column have an important impact on the absorption and transformation of river nutrients kelly 2001 liu et al 2019 maavara et al 2015 milliman 1997 paul 2003 putz and benndorf 1998 teodoru et al 2006a another important factor that significantly impacts the downstream transport of river nutrients is the fact that hydroelectric reservoirs usually use bottom drainage to generate electricity this often leads to important differences in the concentrations and forms of nutrients in the inlet and outlet of the reservoir these factors on the one hand destroy the water quality continuity of rivers and bring about negative effects on the regional water environment quality on the other hand changes in the output fluxes and forms of river nutrients also have a potential impact on the primary productivity structure of estuaries and marginal sea areas humborg et al 1997 humborg et al 2000 jiao et al 2007 latrubesse et al 2017 currently approximately 70 of the world s rivers are intercepted by dams kummu and varis 2007 and the global active storage capacity of reservoirs has grown from approximately 200 to over 5000 km3 during the past fifty years which is over 70 of the total global reservoir capacity 7000 8000 km3 vorosmarty et al 1997 zhou et al 2016 certainly this has a major impact on the fluvial flux of nutrients into the sea from global rivers the estimates indicate that due to the retention of reservoirs nutrients from rivers globally have been retained in large quantities for example on a global scale the retention of dissolved silicon dsi in lakes and reservoirs is 163 gmol yr 1 9 8 tgyr 1 maavara et al 2014 total p tp trapped in the global reservoirs was estimated to be 42 gmol yr 1 and the retention of reactive p was 18 gmol yr 1 in the year 2000 it is expected that by 2030 as more dams are built 17 of the tp load of global rivers will be trapped by reservoirs maavara et al 2015 therefore the retention of nutrients and the transformation of their forms in reservoirs are important issues facing the current inland water environment and marginal sea ecosystems understanding the impact of large reservoirs on the nutrient cycle of rivers has important global significance and has practical significance in regional water environment quality protection large reservoirs play a pivotal role in the development of water resources and hydropower in river basins this type of reservoir is significantly different from small reservoirs in terms of hydrological retention time storage capacity and regulating capacity therefore large reservoirs may cause greater disturbances to river water environments in contrast many studies in the past have paid more attention to the retention effect of dams on substances transported by rivers and there is a lack of in depth understanding of the conversion process of nutrients in reservoirs as well as the main controlling mechanism a detailed study on the latter will help improve the water quality of the downstream area as well as the reservoir itself by using the reservoir s regulating capacity in this study a large reservoir in the qiantang river basin in eastern china xinanjiang reservoir xajr was selected for a detailed investigation this reservoir has the characteristics of a long hydrological retention time huge storage capacity and strong regulating capacity it is a typical large scale water conservancy project in a subtropical area through a detailed investigation of the cycling of nutrients in the xajr river system this study focused on the following objectives 1 to reveal the transformation of nutrient contents and forms in rivers by large reservoirs and 2 to elaborate the major controlling factors that affect the nutrient cycling in the reservoir 2 study area and methodology 2 1 studied reservoir and sampling the xinanjiang reservoir e118 42 e118 59 n29 28 n29 58 located in chun an county zhejiang province was constructed in 1959 it is also known as qiandao lake fig 1 it has a surface area of 567 km2 with mean and maximum water depths of 34 m and 117 m respectively the drainage area of the xajr is 10442 km2 and the recharge coefficient is 18 2 the normal water level of this reservoir is 108 m corresponding to a reservoir volume of 17 84 billion m3 the minimum water level is 86 m with a storage capacity of 7 57 billion m3 the climate is typically a subtropical monsoon climate with air temperatures ranging from 5 c to 36 c annual average value of 17 c and annual precipitation of 1429 9 mm on average the air humidity here is approximately 76 and the forest coverage rate of the drainage area reaches 83 wang et al 2015b the area around xajr is a hilly landform the local geology consists of a large amount of sedimentary rocks and shallow metamorphic rocks as well as some volcanic eruptive rocks and intrusive rocks the soil in this area is mainly yellow earth and red earth in this study from august 2013 to june 2014 water samples along the fluvial direction of the xajr were collected at bimonthly sampling intervals fig 1 due to the shallow depth in the incoming river area of the reservoir only surface and bottom water samples were collected moreover four or five layers of water were collected depending on water depth along the water column in the central reservoir during the high water level seasons the sampling intervals were 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m and 45 m in low water level seasons the intervals were 0 m 10 m 20 m and 35 m the discharge from the dam was only collected 0 5 m underwater because of the mixing temperature t ph and do were measured in situ with a portable ph and conductivity meter ysi 6600v2 to determine the dissolved nutrients water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm polycarbonate membrane immediately after sampling and stored in 100 ml plastic bottles on ice in a cooler until analysis for tn and tp water samples were directly stored in 100 ml plastic bottles and h2so4 was added to keep the ph 2 for the tp and tn determinations water samples were first digested in a drb200 digestion instrument hach company and then measured using a dr3900 spectrophotometer hach company the concentrations of dissolved silicon dsi dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din including no3 no2 and nh4 were measured using an automated flow injection analyzer skalar sans plus systems the analytical errors were less than 5 2 2 calculation the thermal stratification index s s

longitudinal variations in water temperature ph do and their seasonal stratification after the impounding of the reservoir as the water level rises seasonal stratification of varying degrees usually develops along the water column water temperature is the most direct indicator of water mixing as shown in fig 2 seasonal water quality stratification especially in summer appeared in the xajr however in winter the water column was completely mixed february was the coldest season in the study area affected by the temperature drop the water column of the reservoir was well mixed with a very small difference in water temperature between the surface and the bottom on the contrary along the direction of river flow the water temperature of the inflow river was low however an approximately 5 c higher water temperature was found in discharge from the dam similar to the distribution pattern of water temperature in february ph and do saturation did not show stratification along the water column indicating good mixing in the vertical direction however along the direction of flow the ph and do saturation of the inflow river were slightly higher than that of the discharge from the dam in august a clear stratification of water quality was developed in the xajr fig 2 contrary to february the variation in surface water temperature was small along the direction of flow in august but there was a clear thermal stratification along the water column in the central reservoir area near the dam the temperature difference between the surface and bottom water reached 20 c this also led to a low water temperature 19 4 c downstream of the dam due to the bottom water discharge for hydropower generation compared with the inflow river the discharge from the dam was 10 c lower furthermore ph is an important water quality indicator similar to thermal stratification the ph along the water column in the reservoir also showed apparent stratification the ph difference between the surface and the bottom water in the central reservoir area reached 2 4 whereas the ph downstream of the dam was 1 7 units lower than that of the inflow river in the same way the stratification of the do saturation degree was also developed in the xajr due to the influence of thermal stratification there was a lack of exchange between the upper and lower water bodies which results in the do of the lower water not being replenished therefore the do saturation of the lower water body decreased significantly for example the do saturation of the surface water in the central reservoir area reached 130 whereas in the hypolimnion the do could be less than 50 in august this indicates that photosynthesis in the epilimnion was enhanced whereas the hypolimnion was mainly controlled by the process of oxygen consumption compared with the inflow river entering the reservoir the downstream dam had a lower do saturation this is mainly due to the deep water discharge in general affected by the seasonal stratification of water quality and bottom water discharge from the dam the xinanjiang reservoir presented seasonal water quality discontinuities in the direction of river flow 3 2 longitudinal variations in nutrients 3 2 1 longitudinal variations in tn and tp tn and tp are important parameters in water quality and are also the obligatory indicators for evaluating the trophic level of water bodies throughout the year tn concentrations in the xajr river system had large variations achieving a maximum value of more than 300 μμ and a minimum value below 10 μμ the average value was 106 62 μμ along the fluvial direction the tn concentration showed a gradually decreasing trend from the upstream area of the river toward the dam after passing the dam the tn concentration further decreased fig 3 it is worth noting that the tn concentration varied greatly along the water columns at the river reservoir transition area and the central reservoir in august and october this is related to the thermal stratification and transformation of different forms of nitrogen in the water column for example in october tn ranged from 21 4 to 314 μμ in the water column near the dam with the maximum appearing in the 5 m depth however in the cold seasons tn content changed little in the vertical direction but showed a trend of gradually decreasing along the river channel similar to the variations in tn the tp concentration also showed a trend of gradually decreasing from the inflow river to downstream of the dam fig 3 throughout the year the variation range of tp concentrations was smaller than that of tn with a minimum value of 1 24 μm surface water at site 06 in june a maximum value of 14 μm bottom water at site 02 in april and an average value of 3 84 2 4 μm compared with other months the tp concentrations in december changed greatly in the water column but changed relatively little in the direction of river flow in other months except at individual sites the tp concentrations in the water in the study area gradually decreased in the downstream direction but changed slightly in the vertical direction 3 2 2 longitudinal variations in dissolved nutrients changes in the concentration of dissolved nutrients directly respond to the quality of the water environment the dsi concentration of xajr ranged from 5 17 to 211 μm with an average annual value of 70 44 μm the dsi concentration was lower in winter and higher in summer fig 4 this is due to the dsi absorption by diatom reproduction in winter and the enhancement of chemical weathering in summer which results in a large amount of dsi being brought into the reservoir during the thermal stratification in warm seasons the dsi concentration in the reservoir also changed greatly along the water column fig 4 that is the dsi concentration of the surface water was much lower than that of the bottom water and the difference could reach more than 10 times that amount such as at site 06 in june in cold seasons as the thermal stratification disappeared the dsi concentration along the water column tended to be consistent similar to the changes in the water column the dsi concentration also had seasonal variations along the river channel during the thermal stratification period the dsi concentration generally showed a gradual decrease from the inflow river to the downstream although it had a lower value at site 01 fig 4 in the cold seasons the longitudinal variations of the dsi concentration became smaller during this period the dsi concentration in the transition area of the reservoir was relatively low this may be related to the absorption of diatoms in this area fig 4 in xajr nitrate is the main component of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din compared to dsi the concentration of nitrate changed little throughout the year with a minimum value of 35 7 μμ a maximum value of 150 μμ and an average value of 78 22 μμ unlike dsi nitrate showed large changes along the water column and direction of river flow fig 4 which indicated that nitrate has a strong transformation process in the river reservoir system for example although the water depth at the inflow river area was shallow less than 10 m nitrate concentrations except august also had large changes in the water column compared with the cold seasons during the thermal stratification in the warm seasons the concentration of nitrate in the reservoir changed more in the water columns along the direction of river flow the concentration of nitrate gradually decreased in february april and june however in august october and december this trend was less pronounced for freshwater systems dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip is usually the limiting factor for aquatic primary productivity therefore the concentration of dip is highly susceptible to biological processes in water unlike dsi and nitrate the concentration of dip in the study area was very low fig 4 the concentration range of dip was 0 21 5 1 μm and the annual average value was 1 31 0 96 μm in general the dip concentration varied greatly in the vertical direction of the inflow river area and the river reservoir transition zone but had less variation along the water column profile in the central reservoir area similar to the trend of tp the concentration of dip gradually decreased along the direction of river flow which reflected the gradual absorption process of dip in the reservoir of note the variations in dip concentration in october were unique on the one hand compared with other months the dip concentration was lower in october on the other hand there was little change in the water column and direction of river flow this might be related to the impounding process of the reservoir in autumn 3 3 analysis of stoichiometric ratio of nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and silicon are important nutrients for maintaining the primary productivity of water bodies generally for freshwater systems the activity of nitrogen is high in contrast nitrogen fertilizer application and atmospheric nitrogen deposition have been greatly strengthened in the past few decades which makes nitrogen more adequate in water than silicon and phosphorus therefore according to the redfield ratio nitrogen generally does not constitute a restrictive condition for primary productivity in rivers on the contrary because the artificial input of silicon is very small and phosphorus is easily adsorbed by particulate matter under the influence of biological absorption inland waters often exhibit the phenomenon of silicon limitation or phosphorus limitation this is consistent with the nutrient limitation of the water body in the study area at different time and space scales various levels of silicon or phosphorus restricting were developed in the xajr river system fig 5 in terms of space silicon restrictive conditions for the growth of phytoplankton appeared in the areas of river inflow and the river reservoir transition area fig 5a in terms of time december and february were the main periods when silicon restrictions appeared fig 5b therefore according to fig 5a and b it was found that the inflow river area and the transition area were prone to silicon restriction in winter in other regions and other seasons dsi was not a limiting condition for phytoplankton growth in contrast to silicon restriction in the warm seasons growth seasons from april to october phosphorus restriction occurred in the central reservoir area downstream of the dam and some transition areas fig 5c d during the non growth season december and february there was generally no phosphorus restriction condition in the inflow river area or the transition area in general along the river channel the water body in the study area changed from the silicon restriction type in the river area to the phosphorus restriction type in the reservoir area silicon restriction mainly occurred in the cold seasons and phosphorus restriction occurred mainly in the warm seasons 3 4 retention effect of nutrients after the reservoir is impounded with the development of physical and chemical stratification inside the reservoir and the discharge manner from the dam reservoir the water quality of the river appears discontinuous in the direction of flow by comparing the differences in water quality parameters between the input river and the discharge from the dam it was found that after passing through the reservoir the concentrations of nutrients in the river had changed to varying degrees temperature ph and do saturation of the discharged water showed a decreasing trend with an average annual variation rate of 26 11 3 and 11 1 respectively the temperature of the discharge from the dam was only higher than that of the inflow river in winter fig 6 a the dsi concentration of the discharged water was higher than that of the inflow river during october and december and its variation rate was negative close to 95 in other months the variation rates of dsi were positive the concentrations of tn tp and dip in the discharged water were lower than those of the inflow river indicating that these nutrients have significant retention effects in the reservoir fig 6b at the annual average level the variation rates of tn and dip were higher reaching 50 3 and 54 3 respectively followed by tp and dsi with rates of 27 9 and 23 3 respectively as the major form of din nitrate had a variation rate of 33 27 with an annual average rate of only 6 6 fig 6c this might be related to the high do level in the xajr which also indicated that this reservoir had a limited retention effect on nitrate in contrast nitrite and ammonia had large variation rates both showed that the concentrations in the discharge water were significantly lower than those in the incoming river throughout the year the annual average variation rates of nitrite and ammonia were 81 5 and 95 5 respectively which also led to a higher annual average rate of din fig 6c changes in nutrient concentrations and forms have an important effect on the stoichiometric ratio of nutrients in the discharged water as shown in fig 6d the annual average variation rate of silicon to nitrogen ratio was the smallest 6 whereas the ratios of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus in the discharged water increased significantly with variation rates of 94 and 72 respectively this also revealed that phosphorus is more likely to be retained in the reservoir than nitrogen and silicon the variation rate of the tn to tp ratio was 20 4 discussion 4 1 influence of thermal stratification on do and ph the thermal stratification state represents the stability of the layered structure of the water column the higher the thermal stratification index δt t average the weaker the exchange between the upper and lower water bodies of the reservoir the more stable the layered structure and conversely the better the water mixing in the vertical direction affected by the strong hydrodynamics the water body of the inflow river was well mixed and the thermal stratification index remained low throughout the year as the transition area of the reservoir has both the characteristics of the natural river and large lake the water body in this area showed weak seasonal stratification due to the weak hydrodynamics in the central reservoir area seasonal thermal stratification was well developed with a high thermal stratification index during the warm seasons the differences in seasonal thermal stratification intensity in different areas of large reservoirs had an important impact on water quality after entering the reservoir the flow velocity of the river gradually slows down which is conducive to the development of seasonal thermal stratification in warm seasons however with the weakening of the hydrodynamics the thickness of the euphotic layer increased promoting the enhancement of photosynthesis in the epilimnion especially in the growing seasons strong photosynthesis results in a significant increase in do saturation degree and ph in the epilimnion of the reservoir aviles and niell 2007 han et al 2018 in the xajr the variations in the water quality parameters do and ph of the epilimnion showed a dependence on the intensity of thermal stratification fig 7 a b this reflects the controlling effect of thermal stratification on the development of the lake autotrophic process 4 2 effect of thermal stratification on nutrient cycling generally similar to most freshwater systems duan et al 2007 perez et al 2011 turner et al 2003 wang et al 2018 nitrogen did not constitute the limiting factor of primary productivity in the xajr the main limiting factor was phosphorus during the winter most of the river reservoir transition area except site 01 in february was in the state of silicon limitation fig 5a b the increase in the thermal stratification index means that the stability of the water body improved and the photosynthesis of the water body will be enhanced therefore the absorption of phosphorus by phytoplankton is intensified leading to a decrease in dip concentration in the euphotic layer in fig 7c the thermal stratification index of the xajr had a negative logarithmic relationship with the dip concentration in the epilimnion this indicates that the thermal stratification of the water body has an important control effect on the photosynthesis of the water body fig 7a b further determining the concentration change of dip unlike dip only in winter dsi became the limiting factor for primary productivity at the inflow river and transition areas this is due to the influence of algae s competitive advantage diatoms are more suitable for growing in cold seasons and areas with strong hydrodynamics conley et al 1993 huang et al 2019 wang et al 2014 as a result in the river and transition areas the dsi concentration of the epilimnion and the thermal stratification index showed a positive correlation fig 7d which indicated that in these areas diatoms are more likely to grow in winter without thermal stratification leading to the occurrence of silicon restriction fig 5 as seasonal thermal stratification developed gradually these areas were gradually dominated by other non diatom phytoplankton sendra et al 2019 varol 2019 owing to the weak hydrodynamics in the central reservoir area it is difficult for diatoms to form dominant populations therefore dsi did not constitute a limiting factor in the central reservoir area and was not constrained by thermal stratification fig 7d accordingly the si n and si p ratios of the surface water were affected by the thermal stratification of the water body only in the river and transition areas fig 7e f in addition to seasonal thermal stratification other factors also affected the nutrient cycling process in the reservoir correlation analysis of the water quality parameters of all water samples showed that there were different degrees of coupling among nutrients table 1 nitrate had a significant negative correlation with water temperature which indicated that the higher the water temperature the greater the rate of absorption and conversion of nitrate during the period of thermal stratification the saturation degree of do in the deep water of reservoirs was usually low friedl and wüest 2002 wang et al 2018 which is conducive to the occurrence of denitrification processes cubas et al 2019 fadhullah et al 2020 liu et al 2011 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 accordingly there was a positive correlation between nitrate and nitrite in addition nitrite also had a significant positive correlation with ammonia indicating that the nitrification process existed 4 3 nutrient cycle in reservoir and its environmental impact the changes in a river after impounding are mainly reflected in the seasonal thermal stratification of reservoirs and the further derived chemical and biological stratification han et al 2018 liu et al 2017 under the combined effects of the biogeochemical cycle in the reservoir and bottom water discharge in a hydropower reservoir nutrients downstream of the dam are quite different in forms and concentrations from those in the inflow river kelly 2001 matzinger et al 2007 in fig 8 the major geochemical cycling processes of nutrients in the river reservoir system are outlined during the period of thermal stratification after entering the reservoir particulate matter such as particulate organic matter and inorganic suspended matter carried by the river gradually settle which also leads to the accumulation of tp and tn in the sediment the hydrodynamic condition of the transition area is weaker than that of the inflow river area and stronger than that of the central reservoir and therefore weak seasonal thermal stratification is formed however the transition area inherits a large amount of nutrients from upstream inputs as a result diatom growth is favored leading to the absorption of dissolved nitrogen phosphorus and silicon due to weak hydrodynamics seasonal thermal stratification is well developed in the central reservoir area fig 2 the growth of phytoplankton in this area is limited by the level of nutrient supply especially the dip fig 5 on the vertical profile of the reservoir part of the newly formed organic matter is degraded in the upper layer of water and the dissolved nutrients are released to the water body again restricted by thermal stratification and the consumption of do in the water column the deep water of large reservoirs often shows seasonal do scarcity bellanger et al 2004 han et al 2018 the decomposition of organic matter settled from the upper water is therefore accompanied by the denitrification process which also leads to the nitrification process due to the upward migration of the reduced nitrogen component fig 8 consequently nitrification and denitrification processes are often associated with adjacent water layers liu et al 2011 wang et al 2019 reservoir sediment is an important sink of exogenous organic matter imported from rivers autogenous organic matter and nutrients it is also the main place for the anaerobic degradation of organic matter and nutrient mineralization re releasing nutrients such as nh4 dsi and dip to the overlying water body the water intake of a hydropower reservoir is usually located near the dead storage level which is conducive to the downstream transport of mineralized nutrients from the deep water of the reservoir the seasonal thermal stratification of large reservoirs biogeochemical cycle processes inside reservoirs and special deep water discharge mode from dams greatly impact the environmental quality of the river 1 compared with that of inflow water at the annual average level temperature ph and do of the discharge water from the dam are reduced fig 6a this may have an adverse effect on the growth of organisms in the downstream channel for example after the construction of a dam upstream of the colorado river the growth rate of the clams downstream significantly changed schone et al 2003 similarly the hydrological regulation of reservoirs also caused the changes in the downstream biodiversity and ecological anomalies in the estuary area jiao et al 2007 power et al 1996 2 according to the average annual variation rates of tn tp dsi dip and din fig 6b c large reservoirs have an important effect on the retention of these nutrients among them the retention of dsi will have an important impact on the normal growth of diatoms in downstream water and even in the estuary area humborg et al 1997 humborg et al 2008 huang et al 2019 ran et al 2013 wang et al 2010 3 in addition to the reduction in the concentration of nutrients transported downstream the stoichiometric ratio of nutrients in the discharge from the dam such as the important increase of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus ratio also changes greatly 5 conclusions xajr is a typical large reservoir which is the type of reservoir very important and representative in the cascade development of hydropower in drainage basins based on the systematic investigation of the thermal stratification and the variations in nutrient concentrations in the xajr the influence mechanism of large reservoirs on the nutrient cycle of the river was clarified it was found that the thermal stratification of large reservoirs has evident seasonal characteristics from the direction of river flow the thermal stratification increases gradually from the inflow river to the central reservoir do ph and dip concentrations in the epilimnion are all dependent on thermal stratification indicating that thermal stratification has an important effect on photosynthesis intensity dissolved silicon and phosphorus are the main limiting factors of primary productivity among them silicon limitation mainly occurred in cold seasons in the inflow river and transition area of large reservoirs whereas the limiting effect of phosphorus occurred mainly in the growing seasons large reservoirs have important retention effects on nitrogen phosphorus and silicon of which the retention rate of nitrate is low and that of dip is high the difference in the retention efficiency of different nutrients in the reservoir also leads to great changes in the stoichiometric ratio of the nutrients in the discharge water from the reservoir among them the ratio of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus increased significantly which is conducive to improving the silicon limitation of downstream water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

17559,antifouling paints are biocidal products applied to ship and boat hulls in order to prevent the growth and settlement of marine organisms i e fouling the release of biocides from the surface of the paint film act to repel or poison potential settling organisms currently the most commonly used biocide in antifouling paints is cuprous oxide in the eu antifouling products are regulated under the biocidal products regulation bpr which states that the recommended dose should be the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect for antifouling products the dose is measured as the release rate of biocide s from coating in this study the release rates of copper and zinc from eight different coatings for leisure boats were determined through static exposure of coated panels in four different harbors located in swedish waters along a salinity gradient ranging from 0 to 27 psu the results showed the release rate of copper to increase with increasing salinity paints with a higher content of cuprous oxide were also found to release larger amounts of copper the coatings ability to prevent biofouling was also evaluated and no significant difference in efficacy between the eight tested products was observed at the brackish and marine sites hence the products with high release rates of copper were equally efficient as those with 4 6 times lower releases these findings suggest that current antifouling paints on the market are leaching copper in excess of the effective dose in brackish and marine waters additionally the results from the freshwater site showed no benefit in applying a copper containing paint for the purpose of fouling prevention this indicates that the use of biocidal paints in freshwater bodies potentially results in an unnecessary release of copper by reducing the release rates of copper from antifouling paints in marine waters and restricting the use of biocidal paints in freshwater the load of copper to the environment could be substantially reduced graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antifouling paint leisure boat hull fouling copper zinc release rate 1 introduction antifouling paints are biocidal products applied to boat and ship hulls in order to avoid the colonization of the hull surface by fouling organisms almeida et al 2007 in the eu these products are regulated under the biocidal products regulation bpr european parliament and council 2012 the bpr annex vi art 77 states that the recommended dose of a biocidal product should be the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect for antifouling

art 19 1 of the bpr further states that authorization of a biocidal product will only be granted according if that product is shown to be sufficiently effective the efficacy of an antifouling paint is typically evaluated through simulated field tests whereby treated panels are exposed in seawater under static and or dynamic conditions kojima et al 2016 static raft tests are generally considered to represent worst case scenarios as static hydrodynamic conditions are generally more favorable for the settlement of fouling organisms cassé and swain 2006 patch tests can also be performed which involve painting patches or strips with the coating on vessel hulls european chemical agency 2018 whereas static tests may indeed be considered a worst case scenario for ship paints the conditions of such tests are not far removed from those of recreational vessels which tend to be idle for large periods of time in sweden leisure boats are for example only actively used during 10 of the boating season according to a national survey the swedish transport agency 2015 after exposure the type and degree of fouling organisms present on the panel are used to assess the paint s performance biofouling can generally be categorized as either microfouling bacterial and diatomic biofilms or macrofouling e g macroalgae barnacles mussels oysters tubeworms bryozoans little and depalma 2013 typically the efficacy will be determined based on the amount of macrofouling present as this fouling type will have the largest effect on a vessel s fuel consumption as a result of the increase in drag holm et al 2004 according to recent eu efficacy guidelines for biocidal products antifouling paints in marine waters may be considered effective if static tests show a surface coverage of macrofouling 25 european chemical agency 2018 the critical release rate describes the leaching rate of an active substance needed to prevent the attachment of a given fouling organism whoi 1952 if macrofouling is considered as a whole the critical leaching rate 0 surface coverage of macrofouling is thus distinct from and should not be confused with the minimum dose i e the minimum leaching rate 25 macrofouling a paint with a leaching rate below the critical release rate can thus still be deemed efficient according to the eu efficacy guidelines fig 1 knowledge of the critical release rate can nonetheless give an indication of the required minimum leaching rate there are currently ten approved active substances under the bpr european chemical agency 2020 amongst which cu2o cuprous oxide is the most commonly used amara et al 2018 however studies of the critical release rates of copper for various marine organisms are few dated and limited to atlantic waters table 1 a critical release rate of 10 µg cu cm2 day has generally been assumed to be sufficient to prevent the attachment of most animal forms although some algae may still attach at even higher leaching rates barnes 1948 whoi 1952 this leaching rate should however only be considered as indicative as it was determined under laboratory conditions and subsequent studies have shown that even lower leaching rates may be efficient against the settlement of e g barnacles de wolf and van londen 1966 additionally differences in fouling pressure i e quantity and type of fouling organisms present may result in differences in the critical release rate between geographic areas species living in the brackish water baltic sea are subject to constant osmotic stress making them more sensitive to hazardous compounds magnusson and norén 2012 the critical release rates of biocides may therefore be lower in this particular sea area as compared to marine waters here eight antifouling paints for recreational vessels containing copper and zinc were immersed along a salinity gradient 0 27 psu at four different locations along the swedish coast during one yachting season 5 months zno is typically added to most antifouling paints and serves according to the european council of the paint printing ink and artists colours industry cepe to control the polishing rate of the paint cepe 2011 the type and amount of fouling present at the end of the season was assessed as well as the effects of salinity and metal content on the cu and zn release rates with these results the performance of the antifouling paints was assessed in relation to their cu release rates to determine whether the products were following the guidelines of the bpr with respect to minimum leaching rate ultimately the results from this and previous studies were used to estimate and map the critical release rates of cu for the baltic sea and kattegat area 2 materials methods 2 1 paints and study sites eight antifouling paints available on the swedish market for amateur use with copper contents ranging from 6 to 30 wt ww were evaluated in this study table 2 no booster biocides were present in any of the coatings four of the paints are classified as hard coatings h1 h4 while the other four are polishing coatings p1 p4 according to the paints product data sheets the paints were applied to 10 10 cm pvc poly vinyl chloride panels two sets of panels were prepared one set for efficacy fouling evaluation and one set for release rate determination of copper and zinc prior to any paint application the panels were lightly rugged with sandpaper and a layer of primer coating hempel underwater primer was applied this specific primer paint was selected as it was found to contain no measurable concentrations of cu or zn by x ray fluorescence and would thus not interfere with the release rate determination once coated with antifouling paint the panels were attached to grids and immersed statically at 1 m depth during the summer season of 2018 at four locations along the swedish coast table 3 temperature loggers hobo pendant temperature logger ua 002 08 were immersed at all study sites to monitor the water temperature at 1 m depth 2 2 efficacy evaluation for the panels intended for fouling rate evaluation two coats of paint primer and antifouling paint were applied using 10 cm wide paint rollers four replicate panels were prepared for each paint and site as well as control panels coated only with primer the control panels were coated in order not to underestimate the fouling pressure as a previous study showed that panels painted with a biocide free coating were significantly more fouled than unpainted panels wrange et al 2020a the panels were mounted in random order on grids and exposed for 5 months june october 2018 at the four study sites upon retrieval the fouling on the panels was characterized and classified according to the fouling rate fr scale from the naval ships technical manual nstm of the us navy us navy 2006 the scale consists of 10 point increments between 0 and 100 where fr0 represents a clean hull and increasing numbers fr10 fr100 reflect increasing severity of fouling table 4 fr10 fr30 are classifications of various types of soft fouling from micro to macroalgae growth whereas fr40 fr100 represent variations in hard fouling calcareous fouling in the form of tubeworms and or barnacles oysters mussels the surface coverage of each identified fr class was also estimated according to astm d 6990 2005 to assess the overall efficacy of the coatings a single weighted fouling rate frw was also determined for each panel whereby the values of the fr categories 0 100 were multiplied with their corresponding observed surface coverage in and summed according to the following equation where n 100 1 f r w i 0 n f r i s u r f a c e c o v e r a g e i 100 2 3 release rate determination the release rates of cu and zn were estimated through x ray fluorescence xrf measurements using an innov x delta 50 xrf instrument the method whose principle has been described in previous publications ytreberg et al 2017 lagerström et al 2018 utilizes a specific calibration for the measurement of cu and zn in µg cm2 in antifouling paints full details of the calibration used for the measurements in this study are found in lagerström and ytreberg 2020 in brief paint standards with chemically determined concentrations of cu and zn were prepared and analyzed by xrf using a 20 s measurement time the same type of panel coated with primer as used for the panels in the field test were used as background during the measurements standards of ten different antifouling coatings were prepared and analyzed to establish a calibration curve between the area concentration in µg cm2 and the measured xrf signal intensities of cu and zn linear calibration curves with r2 0 99 were established for both elements and the measurement of validation samples confirmed the accuracy of the measurements for the panels prepared for release rate determination single coats of the paints primer and antifouling paint were applied at a wet film thickness of 100 µm using an automatic motorized film applicator tqc ab3120 to ensure thin layers and a smooth finish paint rollers were used to apply two of the paints h1 and h2 as these were not viscous enough to be applied with the motorized applicator the xrf method typically requires a dry film thickness dft 40 µm for most antifouling paints in order to be within the linear range of the xrf and avoid absorption effects of the x ray signal ytreberg et al 2017 the two paints were therefore also rolled onto 80 µm mylar films to enable the determination of their dft a dft 40 µm was consequently confirmed through measurements with a film thickness gage defelsko positector 6000 the xrf method was used to determine the average release rates between days 14 and 56 in a previous study the release rates from five antifouling paints were measured by xrf for two different salinities 5 and 14 psu lagerström et al 2018 the release rates were determined after various immersion times 7 14 28 56 and 84 days and the study found the release rates to be typically highest between days 14 and 56 compared to days 0 14 5 psu and days 56 84 14 psu at the lower salinity the release rate of copper generally increased and stabilized after 14 days at the higher salinity the release rate instead decreased after 56 days ideally the changes in release rate over the whole boating season 150 days would be studied but is technically difficult given the restriction on paint thickness imposed by the xrf method such an investigation may be possible at lower salinities given the lower depletion rate of copper from the paint films at such conditions however for the purpose of comparison the same exposure time was used regardless of site in this study the chosen time period days 14 56 represents nonetheless roughly a third of a full boating season additionally determining release rates during a time interval when they are likely the highest is the most relevant from an environmental point of view precautionary principle and reduces the risk of underestimating the critical release rate needed to deter macrofouling duplicate sets of panels to be collected after 14 and 56 days respectively were therefore prepared mounted randomly on grids and immersed at each study site for each set triplicate panels were prepared for all antifouling paints the concentrations of cu and zn were measured by xrf in 4 designated points on each panel before and after immersion a beam energy of 40 kv ø 10 mm beam size and a measurement time of 20 s was used the raw spectra from the xrf analyses were exported from the instrument and processed using a script in matlab see lagerström and ytreberg 2020 for full method description triplicate measurements were performed on each designated measurement point and their concentrations averaged prior to any further calculation in order to evaluate the precision of the instrument three standards holding low 200 µg cm2 medium 800 µg cm2 and high 2000 µg cm2 concentrations of cu and zn were measured between every three panels with a relative standard deviation rsd 0 8 the variation within one measurement session i e one day was found to be very low and on par with the day to day variation rsd 0 5 2 4 data processing and statistical analyses to calculate the average release rate between day 14 and day 56 the difference in concentration i e loss of metals in µg cm2 between days 0 14 and days 0 56 were firstly determined as the average difference in concentration before and after exposure for either 14 or 56 days for the triplicate panels of each paint at each site measurement points with 80 depletion of either cu or zn after exposure were excluded from the data set this was only the case for a few points 12 out of 768 measurement points the average loss between day 0 14 was then subtracted from that between day 0 56 to the standard deviation σ of this resulting calculated release between days 14 and 56 was propagated from the individual standard deviations of the two measurement sets using the following formula 2 σ r e l e a s e σ d 0 14 2 σ d 0 56 2 the average release as well as the propagated standard deviation were then divided by the difference in exposure time 56 14 42 days to obtain an estimate of the release rate between days 14 and 56 all statistical tests were performed in jmp pro 15 with a significance level of 5 α 0 05 to assess for statistical differences in antifouling performance between treatments antifouling paints and control at each of the four study sites one way anovas with post hoc testing tukey hsd were performed on the weighted fouling rates frw single and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to assess the effect of various parameters on the release rates of cu and zn for the multiple linear regression models five parameters were considered salinity cu content zn content temperature and paint type and stepwise backward selection criterion of p 0 05 employed to only retain significant parameters in the final model for the paints for which a significant regression between release rate and salinity could be established the regression slope estimates were grouped based on paint type and compared using a t test in order to assess any difference based on paint type hard vs polishing linear regression analyses between release rates cu or zn and the weighted fouling rates frw were also performed 3 results discussion 3 1 efficacy the fouling rates recorded for the control panels coated only with primer reflect the local fouling pressure at the study sites after five months exposure in different salinities the control panels at all four sites were completely fouled 99 100 of panel surface covered with fouling but the type of fouling varied from only soft fouling in fresh water to several sorts of hard fouling at the most saline site fig 2 and fig 3 at the saline sites 2 4 fig 3b d hard fouling fr 40 was observed but in varying amounts seemingly as a function of salinity a study of the fouling pressure at various locations in the baltic sea shows however that yearly variations may be greater than those due to variations in salinity wrange et al 2020a in the present study the average panel surface 1 standard deviation colonized by hard fouling increases with increased salinity as follows 0 0 0 0 0 psu 38 15 6 4 psu 97 5 7 5 psu 100 0 0 27 psu with increased salinities fouling prevention methods will thus be presented with greater challenges and the performance demand on the antifouling coating increases the antifouling coatings were found to be efficient in preventing the colonization of calcareous organisms with very low surface coverage 3 of hard fouling fr 40 the only minor recordings of hard fouling were for the paints h1 site 2 6 4 psu 2 5 1 0 coverage and site 4 27 psu 0 3 0 5 coverage and p2 site 4 27 psu 0 5 0 6 coverage hence although the panels coated with antifouling paints were more or less completely fouled at all sites with 90 of the panel surface covered the majority 92 of this fouling was soft fr 30 the presence of soft fouling on the antifouling coatings is not unexpected as several microalgal species are known to be tolerant to copper barranguet et al 2000 finnie and williams 2010 zargiel et al 2011 co biocides also known as booster biocides are therefore typically added to antifouling paints to complement the biocidal activity of copper howell and behrends 2010 at the time of this field study new guidelines within the eu for the evaluation of antifouling paint efficacy were established european chemical agency 2018 according to these static raft testing should generally be carried out over a minimum of six months and cover the full fouling season the guidelines further state that test location s be representative and that three replicate plates be used hence the efficacy evaluation of the present study complies with the new guidelines apart from the exposure time which was one month shorter than recommended in the present study an exposure time of 5 months was chosen as this is the typical length of the yachting season in scandinavian waters and as amateur antifouling paints normally claim to last for one yachting season according to the new guidelines the performance of a product tested in marine waters is acceptable if the coverage of macrofouling on the panels is below 25 european chemical agency 2018 the guidelines define macrofouling as large organisms visible to the human eye such as barnacles tubeworms algae 5 mm this would correspond to hard fouling on the nstm fouling rate scale i e fr 40 hence all antifouling products tested in this study fulfill the eu s efficacy requirement although all antifouling paints investigated in the present study meet the requirements for efficacy differences in performance between the products merits further investigation through comparison of their weighted fouling rates frw see eq 1 the average frw for all treatments including the controls are shown in fig 4 along with the results from the anova testing at the freshwater site site 1 fig 4a the control panels coated only with primer had the significantly least severe fouling out of all treatments with an average frw 1 standard deviation of 11 1 the statistical testing also shows that the antifouling paints h3 frw 12 1 and p1 frw 12 0 were not significantly different compared to the control the remaining six copper paints equally of hard and polishing types displayed however a lower antifouling performance and had significantly higher weighted fouling rates 16 frw 18 compared to the control although a primer paint would not be solely applied to vessels which are coated with biocidal antifouling paint most hulls would nevertheless likely hold some type of biocide free top coating e g epoxy or silicone the result of the biocide free coating in this study albeit a primer suggests that applying a copper coating on a vessel berthed in freshwater is unnecessary and could in some cases even be counterproductive it can however not be ruled out that differences in surface characteristics and paint color which can be factors of importance for settlement and growth of fouling organisms scardino et al 2008 can explain the observed superiority of the primer paint nonetheless the use of biocidal paints in freshwater have been restricted in sweden since 1992 following a risk benefit analysis swedish chemicals agency 1993 according to a swedish national survey 85 of respondent boat owners stated that they do not perceive hull fouling as an issue the swedish transport agency 2015 nonetheless 12 stated that they were using an illegal coating apart from sweden there are only two other countries in the eu with total restriction on biocidal coatings in freshwater bodies denmark danish ministry of the environment 2014 and finland tukes 2018 as for freshwater bodies in other eu member states biocides such as tolylfluanid and dichlofluanid have been banned from use in freshwater according to echa european chemical agency 2014 2016 while the other approved biocides including copper and copper compounds are still allowed as the results here suggest the release of copper from antifouling paints to constitute an unnecessary load of biocides to the environment the potential for restriction should be investigated in other eu member states germany for example has an estimated yearly consumption of 141 tons of cu from the use of antifouling paint on leisure boats and 71 of recreational berths are located in freshwater daehne et al 2017 restrictions on the use of copper paints in freshwater could thus lead to significant reductions in the environmental load of copper for this member state for the saline sites 2 3 and 4 fig 4b d the statistical testing showed identical results a significant difference in frw between controls 33 frw 88 depending on site and antifouling paints 10 frw 17 depending on paint and site and no significant difference between the latter in addition most antifouling paints show no or only small differences in frw between the three saline sites overall all antifouling paints thus performed similarly in brackish and marine waters regardless of type hard or polishing biocidal content and fouling pressure 3 2 release rates 3 2 1 copper the average release rates estimated between days 14 and 56 of exposure are shown in fig 5 all release rates can also be found in table s1 in the supporting information for cu fig 5a it is evident that two parameters affect the release rate salinity and cu content the statistical regression analyses of the study sites salinities against the cu release rates reveals significant linear relationships for all but paint p2 see fig s1a of the supporting information with increased release rates at higher salinity this confirms the findings of previous xrf release rate studies with both polishing and self polishing paints ytreberg et al 2017 lagerström et al 2018 increased salinity has been shown to increase both the dissolution rate cu2o particles as well as the solubility and polishing rates of both polishing and self polishing paint matrices resulting in an increased release of copper from the paint surface ferry and carritt 1946 rascio et al 1988 kiil et al 2002 in lagerström et al 2018 a 2 fold increase in cu release was observed between 5 and 14 psu for four polishing paints a 3 fold increase was however observed for a self polishing paint that was also included in the study this result suggested that the magnitude of the effect of salinity could be dependent on paint type to evaluate the effect of paint type the slopes of the linear regressions established between salinity and the paints cu release rates can be compared the greater the effect of increased salinity on a specific the paint the higher the slope of the regression will be comparison of the slopes of the hard paints slopes of 0 15 0 54 to those of the polishing paints slopes of 0 24 0 88 using a t test revealed however no significant differences in lagerström et al 2018 no correlation between cu content and cu release could be established for five studied paints significant linear regressions could however be established here at all four sites fig s2a a recent study found that an increased concentration of zno albeit when added to the same rosin based paint formulation increased the release of copper lindgren et al 2018 the effect of zn content on the cu release was therefore also investigated however no significant relationship between the paints zn content and the release of cu could be established at any of the salinities for the paints studied here p 0 005 data not shown regardless of whether all or just the hard or polishing coatings were included in the analysis five parameters salinity cu content zn content temperature and paint type were tested for significance on the release rate of cu through stepwise regression in order to obtain a single explanatory model only two parameters salinity and cu content were found to be significant with the resulting model able to account for 74 of the observed variation r2 0 738 fig s3a this suggests that knowledge of salinity and cu content can be used for a rough estimate of the cu release rate at temperatures comparable to those of this study a considerate part of the variation 26 is however caused by other parameters both the solubility of the active cu substance in the paint cu2o or copper powder here and its particle size as well as the properties of the paint resin e g erodibility of the binder and content of other soluble pigments will affect the release rate of cu from a paint yebra and weinell 2009 differences in paint matrix between the eight studied paints could therefore account for the unexplained variability 3 2 2 zinc the effect of salinity on the zn release rates is not as clear cut as for cu fig 5b although the highest release rates are obtained at the highest salinity for some paints h1 p2 and p3 no significant linear regressions between salinity and zn release rates could be established for any of the paints fig s1b for most all but p1 the highest or second to highest release rates instead occur in freshwater suggesting perhaps water parameters other than salinity may be influencing the release rate of zn zn content as an explanatory variable was also not significant at any of the studied sites when considered separately fig s2b out of the five parameters tested for significance in a multiple regression model three were found to be significant on the zn release rate paint type cu content and zn content the overall fit of the model is however poor with r2 0 540 fig s3b the prediction model of the zn release rate is thus more uncertain than that of cu suggesting that unknown parameters have a greater influence on the release of zn than that of cu these are most likely related to the specific composition of the paints and go beyond the simple distinction between hard or polishing 3 3 critical and minimum leaching rate of copper in marine waters as no large differences in frw were detected between paints or sites fig 4 despite large differences in cu and zn release rate fig 5 no significant linear regressions could be established between release rates and frw for either of the two metals data not shown it is thus more relevant to discuss the paints performance and cu release rates in relation to threshold values such as the critical release rate and the minimum leaching rate as mentioned previously an indicative cu release rate of 10 µg cm2 d has been determined as the critical limit to deter attachment of macrofouling barnes 1948 whoi 1952 the presence of macrofouling i e fr 40 on the panels treated with antifouling paints albeit rare can give some idea of the critical release rates specifically for the baltic sea and kattegat area to carry out this assessment the effect of the release of zn on the performance of the paints must be assumed to be limited poor long term antifouling performance of zinc oxide by itself has been demonstrated in another study supporting this assumption lindgren et al 2018 in this study macrofouling was detected in small amounts at sites 2 and 4 at site 2 paint p2 2 5 1 0 surface coverage of macrofouling was the paint with the slowest release 1 9 µg cm2 d at the same site no macrofouling was present on the paint with the second to lowest release rate p1 2 2 µg cm2 d at site 4 two paints were observed to hold macrofouling p2 0 5 0 6 and h1 0 3 0 5 these coatings also held the lowest cu release rates of 4 4 and 5 4 µg cm2 d respectively at this site paints with release rates of at least 7 1 µg cm2 d were however free of macrofouling at site 3 no macrofouling was observed on any of the treated panels suggesting the critical release is below or equal to the lowest measured release rate in summary one can thus deduce that the critical release rate is between 1 9 and 2 2 µg cm2 d at site 2 baltic sea 6 4 psu 1 9 µg cm2 d at site 3 baltic sea 7 5 psu and between 5 4 and 7 1 µg cm2 d at site 4 kattegat 27 psu previous studies of the efficacy and release rates of antifouling paints have also indicated that the critical release rate is 10 µg cm2 d in the baltic sea and kattegat lindgren et al 2018 assessed the efficacies of different paint formulations with cu release rates ranging from 4 7 to 10 6 µg cm2 d after five months static exposure in a marina outside gothenburg sweden 15 psu the study found that the lowest release rate of 4 7 µg cm2 d was sufficient to deter macrofouling at that location in lagerström et al 2018 the release rates of five commercial antifouling paints for recreational vessels were measured in two marinas and found to range between 2 1 4 6 stockholm sweden 5 psu and 4 2 8 9 gothenburg sweden 14 psu µg cm2 d the same paints were found to have no or 1 macrofouling when the efficacy under static conditions was evaluated after 5 months exposure in the same marinas wrange et al 2020b the critical cu release can therefore be deduced as 2 1 µg cm2 d in the stockholm area and 4 2 µg cm2 d in the gothenburg area the latter is comparable to the findings of lindgren et al 2018 the geographical variation in the critical release rate for macrofouling in the baltic sea and kattegat area is shown in fig 6 the leaching rates of the tested products are almost all above the indicative critical leaching rates the minimum leaching rate is therefore by definition also exceeded fig 1 at the three saline sites the efficacy evaluation showed all paints to be effective according to the eu guidelines additionally no significant differences in frw could be established between the eight studied paints suggesting overall similar performances the paints cu release rates on the other hand vary greatly depending on the site the paint with the highest release rate h4 or p4 leached copper at a rate 4 6 times that of the slowest leaching paint h1 or p1 over the first 2 months of the paints lifetime studied here calculated differently the slowest leaching paints thus had release rates corresponding to 16 23 of those of the highest leaching paints this result suggests there is potential for a 80 reduction in cu release rates from the highest leaching antifouling products for recreational vessels in the baltic sea and kattegat area without any efficiency loss 4 conclusions in this study the application of copper containing antifouling paint in freshwater was concluded to be redundant as the products contributed no antifouling effect any release of copper in such environments thus only pauses a risk to the environment without any beneficial gain for the boat owner although there is a ban in swedish freshwater for the use of biocidal antifouling paints that is not the case for most eu countries these member states may gain from performing risk benefit analysis to assess whether the continued use of biocidal antifouling paints in freshwater is indeed necessary for marine waters the mapping of the critical cu release rate revealed variations in the sensitivity of the fouling community in the baltic sea kattegat with higher release rates required to deter macrofouling at higher salinities however as the release rate of cu from antifouling paints also increases with increased salinity all the eight tested paints were found to be efficient regardless of location along the salinity gradient in fact the cu release rates of a majority of the paints greatly exceeded the critical release rate for some products a reduction of up to 80 in the release rate of cu would be possible without any loss in efficiency the properties of these products are thus not in

17559,antifouling paints are biocidal products applied to ship and boat hulls in order to prevent the growth and settlement of marine organisms i e fouling the release of biocides from the surface of the paint film act to repel or poison potential settling organisms currently the most commonly used biocide in antifouling paints is cuprous oxide in the eu antifouling products are regulated under the biocidal products regulation bpr which states that the recommended dose should be the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect for antifouling products the dose is measured as the release rate of biocide s from coating in this study the release rates of copper and zinc from eight different coatings for leisure boats were determined through static exposure of coated panels in four different harbors located in swedish waters along a salinity gradient ranging from 0 to 27 psu the results showed the release rate of copper to increase with increasing salinity paints with a higher content of cuprous oxide were also found to release larger amounts of copper the coatings ability to prevent biofouling was also evaluated and no significant difference in efficacy between the eight tested products was observed at the brackish and marine sites hence the products with high release rates of copper were equally efficient as those with 4 6 times lower releases these findings suggest that current antifouling paints on the market are leaching copper in excess of the effective dose in brackish and marine waters additionally the results from the freshwater site showed no benefit in applying a copper containing paint for the purpose of fouling prevention this indicates that the use of biocidal paints in freshwater bodies potentially results in an unnecessary release of copper by reducing the release rates of copper from antifouling paints in marine waters and restricting the use of biocidal paints in freshwater the load of copper to the environment could be substantially reduced graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antifouling paint leisure boat hull fouling copper zinc release rate 1 introduction antifouling paints are biocidal products applied to boat and ship hulls in order to avoid the colonization of the hull surface by fouling organisms almeida et al 2007 in the eu these products are regulated under the biocidal products regulation bpr european parliament and council 2012 the bpr annex vi art 77 states that the recommended dose of a biocidal product should be the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect for antifouling products the dose represents the speed at which active substances are delivered from the surface of the coating to the surrounding water i e its biocidal release rate which is measured in µg cm2 day art 19 1 of the bpr further states that authorization of a biocidal product will only be granted according if that product is shown to be sufficiently effective the efficacy of an antifouling paint is typically evaluated through simulated field tests whereby treated panels are exposed in seawater under static and or dynamic conditions kojima et al 2016 static raft tests are generally considered to represent worst case scenarios as static hydrodynamic conditions are generally more favorable for the settlement of fouling organisms cassé and swain 2006 patch tests can also be performed which involve painting patches or strips with the coating on vessel hulls european chemical agency 2018 whereas static tests may indeed be considered a worst case scenario for ship paints the conditions of such tests are not far removed from those of recreational vessels which tend to be idle for large periods of time in sweden leisure boats are for example only actively used during 10 of the boating season according to a national survey the swedish transport agency 2015 after exposure the type and degree of fouling organisms present on the panel are used to assess the paint s performance biofouling can generally be categorized as either microfouling bacterial and diatomic biofilms or macrofouling e g macroalgae barnacles mussels oysters tubeworms bryozoans little and depalma 2013 typically the efficacy will be determined based on the amount of macrofouling present as this fouling type will have the largest effect on a vessel s fuel consumption as a result of the increase in drag holm et al 2004 according to recent eu efficacy guidelines for biocidal products antifouling paints in marine waters may be considered effective if static tests show a surface coverage of

nonetheless give an indication of the required minimum leaching rate there are currently ten approved active substances under the bpr european chemical agency 2020 amongst which cu2o cuprous oxide is the most commonly used amara et al 2018 however studies of the critical release rates of copper for various marine organisms are few dated and limited to atlantic waters table 1 a critical release rate of 10 µg cu cm2 day has generally been assumed to be sufficient to prevent the attachment of most animal forms although some algae may still attach at even higher leaching rates barnes 1948 whoi 1952 this leaching rate should however only be considered as indicative as it was determined under laboratory conditions and subsequent studies have shown that even lower leaching rates may be efficient against the settlement of e g barnacles de wolf and van londen 1966 additionally differences in fouling pressure i e quantity and type of fouling organisms present may result in differences in the critical release rate between geographic areas species living in the brackish water baltic sea are subject to constant osmotic stress making them more sensitive to hazardous compounds magnusson and norén 2012 the critical release rates of biocides may therefore be lower in this particular sea area as compared to marine waters here eight antifouling paints for recreational vessels containing copper and zinc were immersed along a salinity gradient 0 27 psu at four different locations along the swedish coast during one yachting season 5 months zno is typically added to most antifouling paints and serves according to the european council of the paint printing ink and artists colours industry cepe to control the polishing rate of the paint cepe 2011 the type and amount of fouling present at the end of the season was assessed as well as the effects of salinity and metal content on the cu and zn release rates with these results the performance of the antifouling paints was assessed in relation to their cu release rates to determine whether the products were following the guidelines of the bpr with respect to minimum leaching rate ultimately the results from this and previous studies were used to estimate and map the critical release rates of cu for the baltic sea and kattegat area 2 materials methods 2 1 paints and study sites eight antifouling paints available on the swedish market for amateur use with copper contents ranging from 6 to 30 wt ww were evaluated in this study table 2 no booster biocides were present in any of the coatings four of the paints are classified as hard coatings h1 h4 while the other four are polishing coatings p1 p4 according to the paints product data sheets the paints were applied to 10 10 cm pvc poly vinyl chloride panels two sets of panels were prepared one set for efficacy fouling evaluation and one set for release rate determination of copper and zinc prior to any paint application the panels were lightly rugged with sandpaper and a layer of primer coating hempel underwater primer was applied this specific primer paint was selected as it was found to contain no measurable concentrations of cu or zn by x ray fluorescence and would thus not interfere with the release rate determination once coated with antifouling paint the panels were attached to grids and immersed statically at 1 m depth during the summer season of 2018 at four locations along the swedish coast table 3 temperature loggers hobo pendant temperature logger ua 002 08 were immersed at all study sites to monitor the water temperature at 1 m depth 2 2 efficacy evaluation for the panels intended for fouling rate evaluation two coats of paint primer and antifouling paint were applied using 10 cm wide paint rollers four replicate panels were prepared for each paint and site as well as control panels coated only with primer the control panels were coated in order not to underestimate the fouling pressure as a previous study showed that panels painted with a biocide free coating were significantly more fouled than unpainted panels wrange et al 2020a the panels were mounted in random order on grids and exposed for 5 months june october 2018 at the four study sites upon retrieval the fouling on the panels was characterized and classified according to the fouling rate fr scale from the naval ships technical manual nstm of the us navy us navy 2006 the scale consists of 10 point increments between 0 and 100 where fr0 represents a clean hull and increasing numbers fr10 fr100 reflect increasing severity of fouling table 4 fr10 fr30 are classifications of various types of soft fouling from micro to macroalgae growth whereas fr40 fr100 represent variations in hard fouling calcareous fouling in the form of tubeworms and or barnacles oysters mussels the surface coverage of each identified fr class was also estimated according to astm d 6990 2005 to assess the overall efficacy of the coatings a single weighted fouling rate frw was also determined for each panel whereby the values of the fr categories 0 100 were multiplied with their corresponding observed surface coverage in and summed according to the following equation where n 100 1 f r w i 0 n f r i s u r f a c e c o v e r a g e i 100 2 3 release rate determination the release rates of cu and zn were estimated through x ray fluorescence xrf measurements using an innov x delta 50 xrf instrument the method whose principle has been described in previous publications ytreberg et al 2017 lagerström et al 2018 utilizes a specific calibration for the measurement of cu and zn in µg cm2 in antifouling paints full details of the calibration used for the measurements in this study are found in lagerström and ytreberg 2020 in brief paint standards with chemically determined concentrations of cu and zn were prepared and analyzed by xrf using a 20 s measurement time the same type of panel coated with primer as used for the panels in the field test were used as background during the measurements standards of ten different antifouling coatings were prepared and analyzed to establish a calibration curve between the area concentration in µg cm2 and the measured xrf signal intensities of cu and zn linear calibration curves with r2 0 99 were established for both elements and the measurement of validation samples confirmed the accuracy of the measurements for the panels prepared for release rate determination single coats of the paints primer and antifouling paint were applied at a wet film thickness of 100 µm using an automatic motorized film applicator tqc ab3120 to ensure thin layers and a smooth finish paint rollers were used to apply two of the paints h1 and h2 as these were not viscous enough to be applied with the motorized applicator the xrf method typically requires a dry film thickness dft 40 µm for most antifouling paints in order to be within the linear range of the xrf and avoid absorption effects of the x ray signal ytreberg et al 2017 the two paints were therefore also rolled onto 80 µm mylar films to enable the determination of their dft a dft 40 µm was consequently confirmed through measurements with a film thickness gage defelsko positector 6000 the xrf method was used to determine the average release rates between days 14 and 56 in a previous study the release rates from five antifouling paints were measured by xrf for two different salinities 5 and 14 psu lagerström et al 2018 the release rates were determined after various immersion times 7 14 28 56 and 84 days and the study found the release rates to be typically highest between days 14 and 56 compared to days 0 14 5 psu and days 56 84 14 psu at the lower salinity the release rate of copper generally increased and stabilized after 14 days at the higher salinity the release rate instead decreased after 56 days ideally the changes in release rate over the whole boating season 150 days would be studied but is technically difficult given the restriction on paint thickness imposed by the xrf method such an investigation may be possible at lower salinities given the lower depletion rate of copper from the paint films at such conditions however for the purpose of comparison the same exposure time was used regardless of site in this study the chosen time period days 14 56 represents nonetheless roughly a third of a full boating season additionally determining release rates during a time interval when they are likely the highest is the most relevant from an environmental point of view precautionary principle and reduces the risk of underestimating the critical release rate needed to deter macrofouling duplicate sets of panels to be collected after 14 and 56 days respectively were therefore prepared mounted randomly on grids and immersed at each study site for each set triplicate panels were prepared for all antifouling paints the concentrations of cu and zn were measured by xrf in 4 designated points on each panel before and after immersion a beam energy of 40 kv ø 10 mm beam size and a measurement time of 20 s was used the raw spectra from the xrf analyses were exported from the instrument and processed using a script in matlab see lagerström and ytreberg 2020 for full method description triplicate measurements were performed on each designated measurement point and their concentrations averaged prior to any further calculation in order to evaluate the precision of the instrument three standards holding low 200 µg cm2 medium 800 µg cm2 and high 2000 µg cm2 concentrations of cu and zn were measured between every three panels with a relative standard deviation rsd 0 8 the variation within one measurement session i e one day was found to be very low and on par with the day to day variation rsd 0 5 2 4 data processing and statistical analyses to calculate the average release rate between day 14 and day 56 the difference in concentration i e loss of metals in µg cm2 between days 0 14 and days 0 56 were firstly determined as the average difference in concentration before and after exposure for either 14 or 56 days for the triplicate panels of each paint at each site measurement points with 80 depletion of either cu or zn after exposure were excluded from the data set this was only the case for a few points 12 out of 768 measurement points the average loss between day 0 14 was then subtracted from that between day 0 56 to the standard deviation σ of this resulting calculated release between days 14 and 56 was propagated from the individual standard deviations of the two measurement sets using the following formula 2 σ r e l e a s e σ d 0 14 2 σ d 0 56 2 the average release as well as the propagated standard deviation were then divided by the difference in exposure time 56 14 42 days to obtain an estimate of the release rate between days 14 and 56 all statistical tests were performed in jmp pro 15 with a significance level of 5 α 0 05 to assess for statistical differences in antifouling performance between treatments antifouling paints and control at each of the four study sites one way anovas with post hoc testing tukey hsd were performed on the weighted fouling rates frw single and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to assess the effect of various parameters on the release rates of cu and zn for the multiple linear regression models five parameters were considered salinity cu content zn content temperature and paint type and stepwise backward selection criterion of p 0 05 employed to only retain significant parameters in the final model for the paints for which a significant regression between release rate and salinity could be established the regression slope estimates were grouped based on paint type and compared using a t test in order to assess any difference based on paint type hard vs polishing linear regression analyses between release rates cu or zn and the weighted fouling rates frw were also performed 3 results discussion 3 1 efficacy the fouling rates recorded for the control panels coated only with primer reflect the local fouling pressure at the study sites after five months exposure in different salinities the control panels at all four sites were completely fouled 99 100 of panel surface covered with fouling but the type of fouling varied from only soft fouling in fresh water to several sorts of hard fouling at the most saline site fig 2 and fig 3 at the saline sites 2 4 fig 3b d hard fouling fr 40 was observed but in varying amounts seemingly as a function of salinity a study of the fouling pressure at various locations in the baltic sea shows however that yearly variations may be greater than those due to variations in salinity wrange et al 2020a in the present study the average panel surface 1 standard deviation colonized by hard fouling increases with increased salinity as follows 0 0 0 0 0 psu 38 15 6 4 psu 97 5 7 5 psu 100 0 0 27 psu with increased salinities fouling prevention methods will thus be presented with greater challenges and the performance demand on the antifouling coating increases the antifouling coatings were found to be efficient in preventing the colonization of calcareous organisms with very low surface coverage 3 of hard fouling fr 40 the only minor recordings of hard fouling were for the paints h1 site 2 6 4 psu 2 5 1 0 coverage and site 4 27 psu 0 3 0 5 coverage and p2 site 4 27 psu 0 5 0 6 coverage hence although the panels coated with antifouling paints were more or less completely fouled at all sites with 90 of the panel surface covered the majority 92 of this fouling was soft fr 30 the presence of soft fouling on the antifouling coatings is not unexpected as several microalgal species are known to be tolerant to copper barranguet et al 2000 finnie and williams 2010 zargiel et al 2011 co biocides also known as booster biocides are therefore typically added to antifouling paints to complement the biocidal activity of copper howell and behrends 2010 at the time of this field study new guidelines within the eu for the evaluation of antifouling paint efficacy were established european chemical agency 2018 according to these static raft testing should generally be carried out over a minimum of six months and cover the full fouling season the guidelines further state that test location s be representative and that three replicate plates be used hence the efficacy evaluation of the present study complies with the new guidelines apart from the exposure time which was one month shorter than recommended in the present study an exposure time of 5 months was chosen as this is the typical length of the yachting season in scandinavian waters and as amateur antifouling paints normally claim to last for one yachting season according to the new guidelines the performance of a product tested in marine waters is acceptable if the coverage of macrofouling on the panels is below 25 european chemical agency 2018 the guidelines define macrofouling as large organisms visible to the human eye such as barnacles tubeworms algae 5 mm this would correspond to hard fouling on the nstm fouling rate scale i e fr 40 hence all antifouling products tested in this study fulfill the eu s efficacy requirement although all antifouling paints investigated in the present study meet the requirements for efficacy differences in performance between the products merits further investigation through comparison of their weighted fouling rates frw see eq 1 the average frw for all treatments including the controls are shown in fig 4 along with the results from the anova testing at the freshwater site site 1 fig 4a the control panels coated only with primer had the significantly least severe fouling out of all treatments with an average frw 1 standard deviation of 11 1 the statistical testing also shows that the antifouling paints h3 frw 12 1 and p1 frw 12 0 were not significantly different compared to the control the remaining six copper paints equally of hard and polishing types displayed however a lower antifouling performance and had significantly higher weighted fouling rates 16 frw 18 compared to the control although a primer paint would not be solely applied to vessels which are coated with biocidal antifouling paint most hulls would nevertheless likely hold some type of biocide free top coating e g epoxy or silicone the result of the biocide free coating in this study albeit a primer suggests that applying a copper coating on a vessel berthed in freshwater is unnecessary and could in some cases even be counterproductive it can however not be ruled out that differences in surface characteristics and paint color which can be factors of importance for settlement and growth of fouling organisms scardino et al 2008 can explain the observed superiority of the primer paint nonetheless the use of biocidal paints in freshwater have been restricted in sweden since 1992 following a risk benefit analysis swedish chemicals agency 1993 according to a swedish national survey 85 of respondent boat owners stated that they do not perceive hull fouling as an issue the swedish transport agency 2015 nonetheless 12 stated that they were using an illegal coating apart from sweden there are only two other countries in the eu with total restriction on biocidal coatings in freshwater bodies denmark danish ministry of the environment 2014 and finland tukes 2018 as for freshwater bodies in other eu member states biocides such as tolylfluanid and dichlofluanid have been banned from use in freshwater according to echa european chemical agency 2014 2016 while the other approved biocides including copper and copper compounds are still allowed as the results here suggest the release of copper from antifouling paints to constitute an unnecessary load of biocides to the environment the potential for restriction should be investigated in other eu member states germany for example has an estimated yearly consumption of 141 tons of cu from the use of antifouling paint on leisure boats and 71 of recreational berths are located in freshwater daehne et al 2017 restrictions on the use of copper paints in freshwater could thus lead to significant reductions in the environmental load of copper for this member state for the saline sites 2 3 and 4 fig 4b d the statistical testing showed identical results a significant difference in frw between controls 33 frw 88 depending on site and antifouling paints 10 frw 17 depending on paint and site and no significant difference between the latter in addition most antifouling paints show no or only small differences in frw between the three saline sites overall all antifouling paints thus performed similarly in brackish and marine waters regardless of type hard or polishing biocidal content and fouling pressure 3 2 release rates 3 2 1 copper the average release rates estimated between days 14 and 56 of exposure are shown in fig 5 all release rates can also be found in table s1 in the supporting information for cu fig 5a it is evident that two parameters affect the release rate salinity and cu content the statistical regression analyses of the study sites salinities against the cu release rates reveals significant linear relationships for all but paint p2 see fig s1a of the supporting information with increased release rates at higher salinity this confirms the findings of previous xrf release rate studies with both polishing and self polishing paints ytreberg et al 2017 lagerström et al 2018 increased salinity has been shown to increase both the dissolution rate cu2o particles as well as the solubility and polishing rates of both polishing and self polishing paint matrices resulting in an increased release of copper from the paint surface ferry and carritt 1946 rascio et al 1988 kiil et al 2002 in lagerström et al 2018 a 2 fold increase in cu release was observed between 5 and 14 psu for four polishing paints a 3 fold increase was however observed for a self polishing paint that was also included in the study this result suggested that the magnitude of the effect of salinity could be dependent on paint type to evaluate the effect of paint type the slopes of the linear regressions established between salinity and the paints cu release rates can be compared the greater the effect of increased salinity on a specific the paint the higher the slope of the regression will be comparison of the slopes of the hard paints slopes of 0 15 0 54 to those of the polishing paints slopes of 0 24 0 88 using a t test revealed however no significant differences in lagerström et al 2018 no correlation between cu content and cu release could be established for five studied paints significant linear regressions could however be established here at all four sites fig s2a a recent study found that an increased concentration of zno albeit when added to the same rosin based paint formulation increased the release of copper lindgren et al 2018 the effect of zn content on the cu release was therefore also investigated however no significant relationship between the paints zn content and the release of cu could be established at any of the salinities for the paints studied here p 0 005 data not shown regardless of whether all or just the hard or polishing coatings were included in the analysis five parameters salinity cu content zn content temperature and paint type were tested for significance on the release rate of cu through stepwise regression in order to obtain a single explanatory model only two parameters salinity and cu content were found to be significant with the resulting model able to account for 74 of the observed variation r2 0 738 fig s3a this suggests that knowledge of salinity and cu content can be used for a rough estimate of the cu release rate at temperatures comparable to those of this study a considerate part of the variation 26 is however caused by other parameters both the solubility of the active cu substance in the paint cu2o or copper powder here and its particle size as well as the properties of the paint resin e g erodibility of the binder and content of other soluble pigments will affect the release rate of cu from a paint yebra and weinell 2009 differences in paint matrix between the eight studied paints could therefore account for the unexplained variability 3 2 2 zinc the effect of salinity on the zn release rates is not as clear cut as for cu fig 5b although the highest release rates are obtained at the highest salinity for some paints h1 p2 and p3 no significant linear regressions between salinity and zn release rates could be established for any of the paints fig s1b for most all but p1 the highest or second to highest release rates instead occur in freshwater suggesting perhaps water parameters other than salinity may be influencing the release rate of zn zn content as an explanatory variable was also not significant at any of the studied sites when considered separately fig s2b out of the five parameters tested for significance in a multiple regression model three were found to be significant on the zn release rate paint type cu content and zn content the overall fit of the model is however poor with r2 0 540 fig s3b the prediction model of the zn release rate is thus more uncertain than that of cu suggesting that unknown parameters have a greater influence on the release of zn than that of cu these are most likely related to the specific composition of the paints and go beyond the simple distinction between hard or polishing 3 3 critical and minimum leaching rate of copper in marine waters as no large differences in frw were detected between paints or sites fig 4 despite large differences in cu and zn release rate fig 5 no significant linear regressions could be established between release rates and frw for either of the two metals data not shown it is thus more relevant to discuss the paints performance and cu release rates in relation to threshold values such as the critical release rate and the minimum leaching rate as mentioned previously an indicative cu release rate of 10 µg cm2 d has been determined as the critical limit to deter attachment of macrofouling barnes 1948 whoi 1952 the presence of macrofouling i e fr 40 on the panels treated with antifouling paints albeit rare can give some idea of the critical release rates specifically for the baltic sea and kattegat area to carry out this assessment the effect of the release of zn on the performance of the paints must be assumed to be limited poor long term antifouling performance of zinc oxide by itself has been demonstrated in another study supporting this assumption lindgren et al 2018 in this study macrofouling was detected in small amounts at sites 2 and 4 at site 2 paint p2 2 5 1 0 surface coverage of macrofouling was the paint with the slowest release 1 9 µg cm2 d at the same site no macrofouling was present on the paint with the second to lowest release rate p1 2 2 µg cm2 d at site 4 two paints were observed to hold macrofouling p2 0 5 0 6 and h1 0 3 0 5 these coatings also held the lowest cu release rates of 4 4 and 5 4 µg cm2 d respectively at this site paints with release rates of at least 7 1 µg cm2 d were however free of macrofouling at site 3 no macrofouling was observed on any of the treated panels suggesting the critical release is below or equal to the lowest measured release rate in summary one can thus deduce that the critical release rate is between 1 9 and 2 2 µg cm2 d at site 2 baltic sea 6 4 psu 1 9 µg cm2 d at site 3 baltic sea 7 5 psu and between 5 4 and 7 1 µg cm2 d at site 4 kattegat 27 psu previous studies of the efficacy and release rates of antifouling paints have also indicated that the critical release rate is 10 µg cm2 d in the baltic sea and kattegat lindgren et al 2018 assessed the efficacies of different paint formulations with cu release rates ranging from 4 7 to 10 6 µg cm2 d after five months static exposure in a marina outside gothenburg sweden 15 psu the study found that the lowest release rate of 4 7 µg cm2 d was sufficient to deter macrofouling at that location in lagerström et al 2018 the release rates of five commercial antifouling paints for recreational vessels were measured in two marinas and found to range between 2 1 4 6 stockholm sweden 5 psu and 4 2 8 9 gothenburg sweden 14 psu µg cm2 d the same paints were found to have no or 1 macrofouling when the efficacy under static conditions was evaluated after 5 months exposure in the same marinas wrange et al 2020b the critical cu release can therefore be deduced as 2 1 µg cm2 d in the stockholm area and 4 2 µg cm2 d in the gothenburg area the latter is comparable to the findings of lindgren et al 2018 the geographical variation in the critical release rate for macrofouling in the baltic sea and kattegat area is shown in fig 6 the leaching rates of the tested products are almost all above the indicative critical leaching rates the minimum leaching rate is therefore by definition also exceeded fig 1 at the three saline sites the efficacy evaluation showed all paints to be effective according to the eu guidelines additionally no significant differences in frw could be established between the eight studied paints suggesting overall similar performances the paints cu release rates on the other hand vary greatly depending on the site the paint with the highest release rate h4 or p4 leached copper at a rate 4 6 times that of the slowest leaching paint h1 or p1 over the first 2 months of the paints lifetime studied here calculated differently the slowest leaching paints thus had release rates corresponding to 16 23 of those of the highest leaching paints this result suggests there is potential for a 80 reduction in cu release rates from the highest leaching antifouling products for recreational vessels in the baltic sea and kattegat area without any efficiency loss 4 conclusions in this study the application of copper containing antifouling paint in freshwater was concluded to be redundant as the products contributed no antifouling effect any release of copper in such environments thus only pauses a risk to the environment without any beneficial gain for the boat owner although there is a ban in swedish freshwater for the use of biocidal antifouling paints that is not the case for most eu countries these member states may gain from performing risk benefit analysis to assess whether the continued use of biocidal antifouling paints in freshwater is indeed necessary for marine waters the mapping of the critical cu release rate revealed variations in the sensitivity of the fouling community in the baltic sea kattegat with higher release rates required to deter macrofouling at higher salinities however as the release rate of cu from antifouling paints also increases with increased salinity all the eight tested paints were found to be efficient regardless of location along the salinity gradient in fact the cu release rates of a majority of the paints greatly exceeded the critical release rate for some products a reduction of up to 80 in the release rate of cu would be possible without any loss in efficiency the properties of these products are thus not in
