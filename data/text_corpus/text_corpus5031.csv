25155,predictions by ecological niche models enm are affected by several sources of uncertainty including the modeling methods and type of variables employed the predictive uncertainty has been often assessed in terrestrial ecosystems but it is still unknown how freshwater variables affect the performance of enms contributing to unreliable predictions for aquatic species here we used the ecologically and economically relevant amazon giant catfish brachyplatystoma filamentosum as a model species to assess uncertainties on enm predictions in freshwater ecosystems specifically we assessed uncertainty by coupling enm predictions using five modeling methods and four sets of freshwater environmental variables our results indicate that the modeling methods and secondarily the variables account for significant uncertainty in predicting freshwater species distribution using enm areas with high environmental suitability such as the amazon large rivers and nearby areas presented high uncertainty for the methods component and lower uncertainties for freshwater variables moreover freshwater variables accounted also for uncertainties in metrics of models performance whereas topographic variables better predicted presences higher sensitivities and lower omission errors land cover and soil variables better predicted pseudo absences higher specificities and lower commission errors the hydroclimatic variables had better accuracy metrics values auc and tss but also generated the greatest uncertainty for the final models when included variables from all groups enms presented low uncertainties and good accuracy in sum our findings suggest the importance of measuring and mapping the uncertainties of enms using freshwater environmental database keywords predictors variables factorial anova species distribution amazon ecoregions brachyplatystoma filamentosum 1 introduction ecological niche models enms araújo and peterson 2012 peterson and soberón 2012 have been widely used to predict the geographical distribution of species lobo et al 2010 vaz et al 2015 enms use environmental aspects from known species occurrences to define suitable areas for populations surviving peterson et al 2011 and have been applied to different research interests such as conservation biology da cunha et al 2018 de carvalho et al 2017 martínez meyer et al 2006 biogeography and phylogeography alvarado serrano and knowles 2014 collevatti et al 2013 evolutionary biology anderson et al 2002 climate change anderson 2013 nabout et al 2011 species invasion jiménez valverde et al 2011 and disease transmission peterson et al 2005 the increasing interest in niche modeling promoted a great expansion in the development of modeling methods and availability of environmental variables vaz et al 2015 all methods are supposed to have benefits and disadvantages depending on the data and specific aims of the study araújo and guisan 2006 when used with the same data different models can lead to different predictions which generate methodological uncertainties araújo and new 2007 similarly decisions related to the choice of environmental variables may also generate discrepant predictions not only the number of predictors variables but their type can also affect the final output and consequently generate model uncertainties araújo and new 2007 synes and osborne 2011 until recently predictions in freshwater ecosystems were constrained by the scarcity of broad scale datasets with aquatic variables despite that terrestrial variables can be used as proxies of aquatic variables frederico et al 2014 mcgarvey et al 2017 they do not translate the directional nature of freshwater ecosystems i e do not consider the river network connectivity and basins limits domisch et al 2015b recently domisch et al 2015a developed specific freshwater environmental variables following the watercourses and summarizing the upstream environment climate topography land cover surface geology and soil this new environmental dataset available at global scale represents an opportunity to improve predictions of aquatic species distribution by using potentially more reliable variables describing freshwater ecosystems it is worth to mention the need of considering the watercourse flow and connectivity along a stream when modeling aquatic environments due to the better representability of the aquatic species dispersal routes domisch et al 2015b however it is uncertain how these freshwater variables contribute to the variability into enm predictions we predict that predictive uncertainty depends on the groups of freshwater variables needed to characterize the complexity and the hierarchical structure of aquatic ecosystems and on the variability inherent to the datasets some studies have tested whether uncertainties are related to the choice of methods gcm general circulation model and emission scenarios buisson et al 2010 diniz filho et al 2009 but there is still a lack of studies regarding the predictor variables synes and osborne 2011 especially in freshwater ecosystems the assessment of uncertainties associated with freshwater species distribution modeling provides a better understanding of freshwater species range which is crucial to develop strategies for the conservation of aquatic biodiversity here we disentangled and evaluated the uncertainties associated with modeling methods and freshwater variables from enm predictions for the amazon giant catfish brachyplatystoma filamentosum we used the new environmental freshwater variables generated by domisch et al 2015a split into four groups hydroclimatic topographic land cover and soil these groups were used together and separately to predict the potential geographic distribution of b filamentosum subsequently the uncertainty of the enms was estimated across the different types of environmental variables and modeling techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 target species we used the ecologically well known and economically relevant amazon giant catfish brachyplatystoma filamentosum lichtenstein 1819 siluriformes pimelodidae as a model species to evaluate the predictive uncertainties associated with niche modeling of aquatic species this species can exceed 2 8 m and 140 kg and is an active swimming predator reis et al 2003 it is distributed mainly in the amazon and orinoco river basins and major rivers of guiana and northeastern brazil berra 2001 this species is useful as a model due to its well known distribution and occurrence records availability in species databases fig 1 2 2 data collection and preparation the occurrence records of b filamentosum were downloaded from the following online databases species link http splink cria org br global biodiversity information facility http www gbif org fishbase http www fishbase org portal da biodiversidade https portaldabiodiversidade icmbio gov br sistema de informação sobre a biodiversidade brasileira http www sibbr gov br fishnet 2 http www fishnet2 net and also from scientific literature cepeda and luque 2010 huergo et al 2011 the occurrence points were mapped on grid cells at 1 km spatial resolution and all duplicated points within the grid cells were removed points without coordinates with approximated coordinates or with regional coordinates e g municipalities were also removed we followed the methodology proposed by verbruggen 2017 to move points outside the 1 km stream grid cells to the closest stream grid cells in the end we used 107 presence points to model the species distribution fig 2 b we downloaded four groups of freshwater climate and environmental variables at 1 km spatial resolution available in the online database earthenv www earthenv org hydroclimatic topographic land cover and soil following the own database categorization we also created an extra group with all variables which represents a package with climate and environmental variables hereafter named all table a 1 to improve computational effort the original variables at 1 km resolution were rescaled to grid cells at a resolution of 0 13 14 km using the aggregate function in raster package hijmans 2016 to remove collinearity among the variables we performed a factorial analysis fa with varimax rotation for each group for the extra group with all variables the fa was performed after grouping the non collinear variables thus removing possible collinearities between groups fig 2a 2 3 modeling procedures a total of five methods were used for modeling species distribution bioclim nix 1986 domain carpenter et al 1993 support vector machines svm schölkopf et al 2001 tax and duin 2004 generalized linear models glm nelder and wedderburn 1972 and maximum entropy maxent phillips et al 2006 besides consider different types of data presence only presence background and presence absence these methods together consider a variety of statistical techniques bioclimatic envelopes environmental distances machine learning and regression rangel and loyola 2012 desirable to access the predictive uncertainty from enms fig 2c enms were built by coupling each of the five groups of non collinear freshwater variables and methods separately because absence data are not available for target species we randomly sampled 107 pseudo absence points same number as presence points within the chosen extension to build the presence absence models the occurrence and pseudo absence points were randomly divided in 75 for training and 25 for testing the models to avoid biased data splits we repeated the partitioning procedure 30 times fig 2d all models 30 repetitions 5 variable groups 5 methods were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc hanley and mcneil 1982 swets 1988 and true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 only models with auc 0 7 and tss 0 5 were used to compute the ensemble maps and further analyses fig 2e the suitability values of the selected models were averaged into a single model for each method in each variable set totalizing 25 combinations of methods and variables e g bioclim hydro domain hydro svm hydro to be used later in uncertainty analysis lastly ensemble maps were obtained by averaging the suitability values from selected models for each variable group in which the model s performance auc were used to compute a weighted mean fig 2f all models were built using functions in the dismo package hijmans et al 2016 and some models required separately packages for specific algorithms e g svm kernlab karatzoglou et al 2004 and glm stats the modeling procedures were based on hijmans and elith 2013 lastly models can be influenced by the chosen extent since the evaluation metrics such as auc tend to increase as the geographic extension used to model also increases barve et al 2011 moreover although the species is restricted to the amazon ecoregions some models may predict presences outside the core areas of occurrence being influenced by pseud absences throughout a greater extension thus to test whether the geographic extension can alter the accuracy metrics values and uncertainty proportions we built the same models set variables methods using two extensions amazon ecoregions and south america 2 4 data analyses we used a factorial anova with two factors suitability methods variable groups to assess uncertainty from enm predictions the mean square ms values were obtained from anova for each factor at every grid cell and represent the uncertainty among predictions we calculated the proportional ms values correspondent to each factor by dividing each ms value by the sum of all ms values see diniz filho et al 2009 fig 2g to measure and compare the magnitude of uncertainty generated by each variable group individually we performed a one way anova with variable groups as a factor and obtained their respective ms values fig 2h the anova was performed by using the lm and anova functions from stats package r core team 2018 to evaluate how accurate were each variable group to predict both presences and pseudo presences in the models we compared the auc and tss values among models as well as the metric from confusion matrix such as sensitivity success in 1 true positive specificity success in 0 true negative omission error error in 1 false positive and commission error error in 0 false negative fig 2d and e lastly we used a mantel test legendre and legendre 2012 to assess the spatial autocorrelation on each variable group using the mantel function in the vegan package oksanen et al 2017 the spatial structure of the models can explain the enm statistics e g auc tss for example high spatial autocorrelation may influence a higher omission error and lower auc and tss values we used the 30 sets repetitions of testing points to compute spatial and environmental distances and to perform the mantel analysis we then calculated the mean and standard deviation of 30 mantel s r for each variable group fig 2i all analyses in this paper were performed using the r software version 3 5 r core team 2018 3 results in general the models showed accepted values of both auc 0 75 and tss 0 5 but models built across the amazon ecoregions extension showed lower values of accuracy metrics than models built throughout the south america for all set of variables especially for soil and land cover variables fig 3 moreover the hydroclimatic based models showed the highest mean of auc and tss for both models built using south america and amazon ecoregions extensions fig 3 the auc and tss values showed concordant metrics of accuracy for all models higher auc higher tss but the type of freshwater variable distinctly affected the omission and commission errors models built with topographic and all variables were more accurate to predict the presences sensitivity specificity and omission commission errors whereas land cover and soil variables generated models that more accurately predicted pseudo absences specificity sensitivity and commission omission errors table 1 hydroclimatic variable produced similar errors these results were based on predictions using the amazon ecoregions extension the hydroclimatic land cover and soil variables showed the greatest spatial autocorrelation mean standard deviation 0 39 0 06 0 46 0 08 0 37 0 07 respectively which may affect the models accuracy metrics leading to lower commission errors table 1 the topographic variable presented distinctly lower mantel s r 0 16 0 12 in comparison to the other variables and together with group all 0 28 0 07 presented the variables spatially less autocorrelated the lower autocorrelation may affect lower omission errors table 1 and higher auc and tss values in this case at least for amazon ecoregions extension fig 3 moreover these topographic variables e g elevation varies greatly in short distances which may inflate the high variation in mantel s r values when comparing the uncertainty generated by modeling components methods accounted for 76 and variables for 14 of the overall variability in the predictions within the amazon ecoregions extension table 2 the core areas of the species distribution showed higher uncertainties generated by the methods and the borders by the variables in the amazon ecoregions extension fig 4 a when evaluated the south america extension the variables and methods accounted for similar uncertainty in model predictions table 2 but with antagonist maps of uncertainty fig 4b whereas methods presented higher uncertainties along the andes and into amazon basin core area of the current species distribution variables showed low uncertainties in these areas fig 4b all freshwater variables groups interpolated relatively well the suitability within the species geographical domain amazon basin the ensemble maps predicted high suitability values in rivers within the amazon basin figure a 1 however models vary considerably when extrapolating predictions for areas outside the amazon ecoregions figure a 2 specifically the topographic and soil variables promoted the most inaccurate extrapolations of species distribution figure a 2 of the total uncertainty attributed to the variables component in the anova the all group was responsible for the lowest mean square values for south america extension and similar mean for amazon ecoregions extension fig 5 thus the models built using the all group produced the most precise predictions i e lowest uncertainty conversely the soil and land cover variables produced models with the greatest uncertainty in the model predictions for the amazon ecoregions and south america extensions respectively i e higher mean and variation of the anova mean square values fig 5 4 discussion our findings express a significant variability in sources of uncertainty depending on multiple components of enms including different freshwater variable groups and the combination of them distinct modeling methods and the geographic extension used specifically freshwater variables produced significant uncertainty on two aspects of enms prediction the spatial suitability maps and model accuracy currently uncertainties associated with enms have increased partially because of the increased number of environmental datasets available sun et al 2017 this generates a great variability in enm results and despite the wide range of choice by researchers it creates misleading decisions when choosing the set of variables buisson et al 2010 thus it is crucial for the researcher working with enms to understand the ecological characteristics of the studied group species araújo and peterson 2012 it is long known that different sources of uncertainties affect the spatial predictions of enms as a whole araújo and new 2007 but here the different types of freshwater variables mainly affected predictions when models were extrapolated to environmental conditions not present in the species occurrence records most models concordantly predicted suitable habitats across the actual species geographical domain figure a 1 but the extrapolation of the potential distribution outside its domain was slightly different between the ensembles generated with each variable group figure a 2 each group of freshwater variables has its own distinct characteristic and spatial structure fernández et al 2013 shabani et al 2016 which distinctly affects enm predictions given the species characteristic for instance the geographical distribution of the studied species is limited to the amazon basin thus the topographic and soil variables promoted the most inaccurate extrapolations of enm predictions figure a 2 likely by not accounting for rivers connectivity and natural basin barriers moreover the constraints in suitable areas for the amazon ecoregions in the hydroclimatic variable set in mainly affected by the physiologically suitable temperature range of this species gouveia et al 2014 thus climatically suitable areas are likely to be in nearby areas these findings suggest that freshwater variables should be carefully selected considering their importance to the species specific attributes the uncertainties generated by the variables were different depending on the extension used the higher uncertainties for the south america extension due to the cumulative uncertainties in areas outside the core distribution of the species i e out of amazon ecoregions in addition it is also worth mentioning the role of the extension in generating different outputs not only for the well discussed effect on model s performance barve et al 2011 but also in the uncertainties generated on spatial predictions of species distribution the freshwater variables groups affected also the models performance and accuracy to predict the species distribution for instance the hydroclimatic variables showed the highest mean values of tss and auc for both extensions which could indicate realistic models using these freshwater variables in addition freshwater variables groups distinctly affected the direction of success error rates of enms predictions whereas the set of topographic and all variables produced enms with good performances to predict the species presences variable showing the highest sensitivities and the lowest commission errors table 1 the land cover and soil variables produced enms that most accurately predicted species absences with highest specificities and the lowest omission errors table 1 these findings indicate that freshwater variables should be also selected by considering the success error in predicting the presences or absences here it is important to remind that true absences data are not available for most known species worldwide and imaginary absences i e pseudo absences are often used to evaluate enms thus it may be not worthwhile selecting groups of freshwater variables that more accurately predict pseudo absences a false attribute of species than presences a true attribute of species anyway our findings elucidate that freshwater variables impute considerable uncertainty on models performance in addition to the longer known uncertainties on predicted values of habitat suitability araújo and new 2007 the direction of success errors and consequently the synthetic accuracy metrics such as auc and tss largely depends on the species prevalence lawson et al 2014 as well as the spatial autocorrelation in input data used to build the models segurado et al 2006 by increasing the geographic extent the species prevalence artificially decreases and random pseudo absences may be sampled distant from presence records thus it is more likely that a model correctly predicts these distant pseudo absences in wider extents than in narrower ones with higher success in predicting absences and lower commission errors the aucs tsss artificially increase in larger extents barve et al 2011 somodi et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 therefore it is important to correctly delimit the available area for the species dispersion known as the movement component in the bam diagram soberón 2007 soberon and peterson 2005 which can provide a meaningful biological aspect to the potential distribution of the species additionally these effects of geographical extent on accuracy metrics are potentiated if the input data especially the distant pseudo absences are spatially autocorrelated de oliveira et al 2014 veloz 2009 our findings suggest that trusting only in the assumption of reliable methods based on accuracy measures may not be the best alternative when evaluating enms especially by using freshwater variables as model predictors thus the joint assessment of metrics and autocorrelation may be helpful to interpret the enm results with more confidence in conclusion our results show that the choice of variables methods and extension area influence the species potential distribution and the evaluation metrics of enms moreover researchers should wisely choose the freshwater variables to build enms in aquatic ecosystems since depending on the variable group used it can generate major differences in evaluation metrics and insert uncertainties into ensemble maps we also address the role of the extension area used to model the species distribution which in many cases is disregarded but can be a great source of uncertainty due to the insertion of absences in areas not truly occupied by the species lastly our study shows that despite sometimes ignored uncertainties should be addressed more often in enm studies because it can be a fundamental addition to the traditional metrics in enms evaluation thus we suggest that studies should always include maps of uncertainty in ecological niche models acknowledgements mrp was supported by capes master s scholarship gt is supported by

autocorrelation may affect lower omission errors table 1 and higher auc and tss values in this case at least for amazon ecoregions extension fig 3 moreover these topographic variables e g elevation varies greatly in short distances which may inflate the high variation in mantel s r values when comparing the uncertainty generated by modeling components methods accounted for 76 and variables for

uncertainties in these areas fig 4b all freshwater variables groups interpolated relatively well the suitability within the species geographical domain amazon basin the ensemble maps predicted high suitability values in rivers within the amazon basin figure a 1 however models vary considerably when extrapolating predictions for areas outside the amazon ecoregions figure a 2 specifically the topographic and soil variables promoted the most inaccurate extrapolations of species distribution figure a 2 of the total uncertainty attributed to the variables component in the anova the all group was responsible for the lowest mean square values for south america extension and similar mean for amazon ecoregions extension fig 5 thus the models built using the all group produced the most precise predictions i e lowest uncertainty conversely the soil and land cover variables produced models with the greatest uncertainty in the model predictions for the amazon ecoregions and south america extensions respectively i e higher mean and variation of the anova mean square values fig 5 4 discussion our findings express a significant variability in sources of uncertainty depending on multiple components of enms including different freshwater variable groups and the combination of them distinct modeling methods and the geographic extension used specifically freshwater variables produced significant uncertainty on two aspects of enms prediction the spatial suitability maps and model accuracy currently uncertainties associated with enms have increased partially because of the increased number of environmental datasets available sun et al 2017 this generates a great variability in enm results and despite the wide range of choice by researchers it creates misleading decisions when choosing the set of variables buisson et al 2010 thus it is crucial for the researcher working with enms to understand the ecological characteristics of the studied group species araújo and peterson 2012 it is long known that different sources of uncertainties affect the spatial predictions of enms as a whole araújo and new 2007 but here the different types of freshwater variables mainly affected predictions when models were extrapolated to environmental conditions not present in the species occurrence records most models concordantly predicted suitable habitats across the actual species geographical domain figure a 1 but the extrapolation of the potential distribution outside its domain was slightly different between the ensembles generated with each variable group figure a 2 each group of freshwater variables has its own distinct characteristic and spatial structure fernández et al 2013 shabani et al 2016 which distinctly affects enm predictions given the species characteristic for instance the geographical distribution of the studied species is limited to the amazon basin thus the topographic and soil variables promoted the most inaccurate extrapolations of enm predictions figure a 2 likely by not accounting for rivers connectivity and natural basin barriers moreover the constraints in suitable areas for the amazon ecoregions in the hydroclimatic variable set in mainly affected by the physiologically suitable temperature range of this species gouveia et al 2014 thus climatically suitable areas are likely to be in nearby areas these findings suggest that freshwater variables should be carefully selected considering their importance to the species specific attributes the uncertainties generated by the variables were different depending on the extension used the higher uncertainties for the south america extension due to the cumulative uncertainties in areas outside the core distribution of the species i e out of amazon ecoregions in addition it is also worth mentioning the role of the extension in generating different outputs not only for the well discussed effect on model s performance barve et al 2011 but also in the uncertainties generated on spatial predictions of species distribution the freshwater variables groups affected also the models performance and accuracy to predict the species distribution for instance the hydroclimatic variables showed the highest mean values of tss and auc for both extensions which could indicate realistic models using these freshwater variables in addition freshwater variables groups distinctly affected the direction of success error rates of enms predictions whereas the set of topographic and all variables produced enms with good performances to predict the species presences variable showing the highest sensitivities and the lowest commission errors table 1 the land cover and soil variables produced enms that most accurately predicted species absences with highest specificities and the lowest omission errors table 1 these findings indicate that freshwater variables should be also selected by considering the success error in predicting the presences or absences here it is important to remind that true absences data are not available for most known species worldwide and imaginary absences i e pseudo absences are often used to evaluate enms thus it may be not worthwhile selecting groups of freshwater variables that more accurately predict pseudo absences a false attribute of species than presences a true attribute of species anyway our findings elucidate that freshwater variables impute considerable uncertainty on models performance in addition to the longer known uncertainties on predicted values of habitat suitability araújo and new 2007 the direction of success errors and consequently the synthetic accuracy metrics such as auc and tss largely depends on the species prevalence lawson et al 2014 as well as the spatial autocorrelation in input data used to build the models segurado et al 2006 by increasing the geographic extent the species prevalence artificially decreases and random pseudo absences may be sampled distant from presence records thus it is more likely that a model correctly predicts these distant pseudo absences in wider extents than in narrower ones with higher success in predicting absences and lower commission errors the aucs tsss artificially increase in larger extents barve et al 2011 somodi et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 therefore it is important to correctly delimit the available area for the species dispersion known as the movement component in the bam diagram soberón 2007 soberon and peterson 2005 which can provide a meaningful biological aspect to the potential distribution of the species additionally these effects of geographical extent on accuracy metrics are potentiated if the input data especially the distant pseudo absences are spatially autocorrelated de oliveira et al 2014 veloz 2009 our findings suggest that trusting only in the assumption of reliable methods based on accuracy measures may not be the best alternative when evaluating enms especially by using freshwater variables as model predictors thus the joint assessment of metrics and autocorrelation may be helpful to interpret the enm results with more confidence in conclusion our results show that the choice of variables methods and extension area influence the species potential distribution and the evaluation metrics of enms moreover researchers should wisely choose the freshwater variables to build enms in aquatic ecosystems since depending on the variable group used it can generate major differences in evaluation metrics and insert uncertainties into ensemble maps we also address the role of the extension area used to model the species distribution which in many cases is disregarded but can be a great source of uncertainty due to the insertion of absences in areas not truly occupied by the species lastly our study shows that despite sometimes ignored uncertainties should be addressed more often in enm studies because it can be a fundamental addition to the traditional metrics in enms evaluation thus we suggest that studies should always include maps of uncertainty in ecological niche models acknowledgements mrp was supported by capes master s scholarship gt is supported by

25156,the phytoplankton s spatial aggregation is a very important phenomenon that can give responses to many questions such as the passage from the unicellularity to the multicellularity in this work we are interested by predator induced aggregations in motile phytoplankton our aim is to bring through a simulation study some explanations on how these groups form and analyze the simultaneous effect of both resource competition and anti predation cooperation on the groups formation process for this purpose we developed a 3d individual based model ibm that takes into account small scale biological processes for the phytoplankton cells that are 1 motion described by a stochastic differential equation in which the drift term is density dependent to take into account the attraction mechanism between cells due to their chemosensory abilities and the dispersal term representing the diffusion of cells in water 2 a density dependent birth death process to describe the demographical process in phytoplankton cells in the latter division and death rates were considered density dependent to include a local competition for resources that slows up the cell s division and a local cooperation in phytoplankton that reduces the cell s predation death we implemented the ibm and considered several scenarios that combine three different levels of resource competition with three different intensities of cooperation the different scenarios were tested using real parameter values for phytoplankton the simulation of the ibm showed that phytoplankton cells form aggregations via the coming together mechanism driven by the cell s motion process in which the attraction mechanism is enhanced by the cooperation behavior the latter is a response to the predation stress after that groups grow through the remaining together mechanism which is a consequence of the division death process and also the attraction mechanism which prevents the daughter cells from leaving the group after division also the simulation of the different scenarios highlights the role of cooperation in the formation of aggregates and shows that although resource competition impairs the aggregation process and the group size cooperation plays an important role in sustaining the aggregating process and when it is strong the induced aggregation process is so successful that it completely prevents cells being grazed and both group and population sizes are maintained at a good level keywords individual based model predator induced aggregation chemosensory ability density dependent birth death process resource competition anti predation cooperation 1 introduction phytoplankton aggregation is a complex biological phenomena that plays a significant role in the primary production and the marine life cycle the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the aggregations formation is very important and can give response to many questions such those related to the development and the evolution of the multicellularity ratcliff et al 2013 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2017 van gestel and tarnita 2017 the reasons behind groups formation in phytoplankton can be social such as protection from predator smayda 1997 boraas et al 1998 lurling and beekman 2006 long et al 2007 sathe and durand 2016 the search of prey spero and morée 1981 the performance of sexual reproduction through gametes fission hadjivasiliou et al 2015 or environmental the process of turbulence durham et al 2013 and the non homogeneous distribution of the resources mellard et al 2012 specifically many works have demonstrated that motile phytoplankton species are more patchy than the non motile ones mouritsen and richardson 2003 durham et al 2013 but very few works were made to describe or and understand the mechanism generating this patchiness and to explain how these cells interact with each other and with their micro environment hutchinson 1961 durham et al 2013 sathe and durand 2016 in this work we focus particularly on the study of the aggregation mechanism induced by the predation risks for motile phytoplankton cells the search of protection from predators is generally considered one of the most important reasons of group formation hamilton 1971 krause and ruxton 2002 spieler 2003 johannesen et al 2014 some experimental studies have shown that the survival rate increases with the increase of the aggregation size foster and treherne 1981 spieler 2003 indeed individuals inside groups can have the benefit either from the avoidance effect since the predators have less chances to find a group of preys than one of many single preys turner and pitcher 1986 krause and ruxton 2002 or from the dilution effect because the predator can only eat a fraction of a group of preys so the larger the group the lower is the chance that a particular individual will be the attacked one krause and ruxton 2002 turner and pitcher 1986 explained that the two precedent effects must be in combination to have a real positive effect called the attack abatement effect on the prey survival some experimental works were made to demonstrate the anti predation aggregation strategies for phytoplankton cells smayda 1997 boraas et al 1998 lurling and beekman 2006 lürling and van donk 2000 ratcliff et al 2013 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 it was observed that many species of motile and non motile phytoplankton form multicellular groups in response to predators however it is not well known if these groups form by daughter cells remaining together after division or by potentially unrelated cells aggregating together for example boraas et al 1998 and lürling and van donk 2000 suggested that group formation in the non motile species chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus was via daughter cells remaining together after division in contrast sathe and durand 2016 demonstrated that the motile species chlamydomonas come together when they are under predation stress these authors suggest that these species of phytoplankton cells respond to the chemicals released by the predator kairomones that give them the green light to aggregate fig 1 in their experimental study the predator is a flagellated protist called peranema that can predate on small single cells but not on large cell aggregations recently kapsetaki and co authors kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 showed a clear and direct fitness benefit of forming groups to avoid predation for some non motile species as a combination between coming together and remaining together after division they observed that the non motile cells s obliquus form predator induced groups within 1 h which is faster than their division time indicating that in a first stage cells aggregate by coming together on the other hand competition for resources also plays a central role on the spatial distribution of phytoplankton cells either at the macroscopic level klausmeier and litchman 2001 huisman et al 2006 litchman 2007 yoshiyama et al 2009 mellard et al 2012 or at the individual level see for instance hellweger and kianirad 2007 fredrick et al 2013 bouderbala et al 2018 and when the group size starts to increase the competition inside the group increases as well bouderbala et al 2018 in general very few experiments were made to study the compromise between the benefits of being in aggregations through the anti predation strategies and the costs of competition inside aggregations boraas et al 1998 grand and dill 1999 bednekoff and lima 2004 and to our knowledge no model on phytoplankton cells was made to address this ecological question and to show the mutual impact of resource competition and anti predator cooperation and its effect on the predator induced spatial aggregations in this work we propose to study the process of groups formation in motile phytoplankton cells under predation stress and to analyze the impact of the simultaneous effect of competition and cooperation in phytoplankton cells on the predator induced spatial aggregations for this purpose we adopt the individual based modelling approach grimm 1999 grimm et al 2006 2010 deangelis and grimm 2013 individual based models ibm s are models that describe characteristics and dynamics observed at the level of individual organisms and describe the changes in their state they are considered as one of the most useful tools for modelling complex systems since they permit to simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple individuals in an attempt to re create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena also they can be applicable to many problems for which the mathematical treatment is hard despite their usefulness only few ibms were conceived to study phytoplankton dynamics in general and phytoplankton aggregation in particular el saadi 2004 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2006 2007 rudnicki and wieczorek 2006 bouderbala et al 2018 so in this work we develop a 3 dimensional individual based model ibm that takes into account small scale biological processes for the phytoplankton cells such as motion and the demographical process the motion is described by the fundamental principle of dynamics grünbaum and okubo 1994 niwa 1994 okubo and levin 2013 that has been applied to phytoplankton cells by el saadi 2004 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2006 2007 using a stochastic differential equation in which the drift term describes the spatial attraction toward the surrounding cells while the dispersal term represents the cell diffusion to describe the attraction mechanism between phytoplankton cells we use the chemotaxis approach that emphasizes biological small scale mechanisms this approach states that motile algae such as dinoflagellates and many other protists flagellates have chemosensory abilities that would be useless if the oceanic environment was chemically homogeneous levandowsky and hauser 1978 spero and morée 1981 fitt 1985 spero 1985 jackson 1987 bell and mitchell 1972 and azam and ammerman 1984 reported that phytoplankton cells excrete some extracellular products and defined the concept of the phycosphere a highly concentrated region in extracellular products that forms around the phytoplankton cell via the chemo attraction induced by its phycosphere a phytoplankton cell attracts its neighboring cells that move towards it el saadi 2004 adioui et al 2005 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2006 2007 for the demographical process we consider a stochastic birth death process the division rate is considered density dependent to include the competition effect in such a way that a cell with higher number of neighbors will have a lower division rate this means that a competitive environment will slow down the division process for the death rate we present two variants the first one by considering the death rate constant and the second by considering the death rate density dependent to include the cooperation behavior between cells as an anti predation strategy we should mention that the cooperation effect is quantified through the death rate which is considered as a decreasing function of the local density this means that a higher number of neighbors will reduce the death rate to simulate our ibm we use monte carlo acceptance rejection algorithm that was initiated by fournier and méléard 2004 to simulate a stochastic ibm that includes a competition effect we organize the paper as follows in section 2 we present a detailed description of the ibm using the odd s protocol overview design concepts details in section 3 the stochastic algorithm is proposed and in section 4 the different scenarios to be tested and parameter values are presented and discussed section 5 is devoted to the simulation results and in section 6 we discuss the results and conclude with some remarks 2 the ibm odd s protocol in this section we adopt the odd protocol overview design concepts details grimm et al 2006 2010 to develop our ibm and for the simulations we use gama platform version gama 1 8 release candidate 1 rc1 that is a modelling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit agent based simulations developed by the international research unit ummisco 2 1 overview 2 1 1 purpose as we mentioned in the introduction we develop a 3 dimensional ibm to study the process of groups formation in motile phytoplankton cells under predation stress and to identify the small scale dynamics that are responsible for the emergence of these aggregations also we aim to analyze the mutual effect of resource competition and anti predation cooperation on the groups formation 2 1 2 entities state variables and scale for the proposed model the entities are phytoplankton cells and each agent has its own attributes we present here only the variable attributes that are the position that evolves in time according to the agent s motion dynamic the division rate the death rate and the nearest neighbor we work under a cubic microscopic 3d environment a ℝ 3 with 500 μm as side length the waiting time δt d is considered random and simulated through the acceptance rejection algorithm see section 3 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling each cell moves in the spatial environment a through its motion equation 1 we consider also a stochastic demography through a birth death process in which each cell can disappear from the space without dividing or divide into two daughters the division process is managed in the simulation as follows the mother cell gives birth to two daughters and disappears just after the two daughters are placed at the location of their mother at the moment of division for the simulation of the ibm we use three time steps see in fritsch and campillo 2017 the global stochastic time step δt that is random and used to compute the next division or death events the saving time step δt save that is deterministic and used to regularly calculate the different statistics n t save r t save η t save m t save and d t save at time t save and the euler time step δt euler that is used to update the cells locations by using eq 3 δt euler h where h is a constant section 3 is dedicated to the algorithm description we undertake our simulations by choosing the stopping simulation time t max equal to the last saving time and by considering that the saving time step δt save is a multiple of the euler constant step h finally we consider that if the next branching time is higher than t max so no division and death will be simulated and only the cells locations are updated until reaching t max 2 2 design concepts 2 2 1 basic principles our model takes into account three small scale mechanisms observed at the scale of phytoplankton cells that are motion competition and cooperation 1 modeling phytoplankton motion we consider the motion equation of the ibm of el saadi el saadi 2004 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2007 in a 3 dimensional environment we recall that in this model phytoplankton cells move according to a stochastic differential equation in which the drift term takes into account the chemo attraction between cells and the diffusion term models the diffusion of cells 2 modeling phytoplankton competition for resources we were inspired by some works made on terrestrial plants bolker and pacala 1997 dieckmann and law 2000 law et al 2003 that use the concept of the local density in these works competition acts on the increase of the death rate in this work we consider that competition affects the division rate and by this give a new mathematical formulation of the cellular division rate as a function of the local competition on the resources we assume that each cell is negatively affected by the presence of its neighbors and hence the cellular division rate is an increasing function of the distance separating the cells and a decreasing function of the number of the surrounding cells 3 modeling phytoplankton cooperation we base on previous experiments demonstrating that some phytoplankton cells develop an aggregation strategy what we call an anti predation cooperation when they are under a predation stress smayda 1997 boraas et al 1998 lurling and beekman 2006 long et al 2007 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 more precisely sathe and durand 2016 demonstrated that the chlamydomonas cells which are species of motile phytoplankton aggregate in the presence of predators or even the filtrate culture of predators they suggested that phytoplankton cells can detect the presence of predators since they are able to sense some chemicals released by a predator we translate this social behaviour among phytoplankton by modelling the death rate as a decreasing function of the local cooperation in all this work we are supposing the presence of predation stress that can be physical or culture filtrate 2 2 2 emergence we analyze the spatial emergent structure of phytoplankton cells i e whether it is aggregated or not according to the variation of demographic parameters also we study some features related to the groups proprieties such as their size 2 2 3 sensing a cell can sense its attracting neighbors if it is present in their attraction zone also each cell can sense its local competitors and collaborators 2 2 4 interaction in this work we have three types of interactions the attraction between cells due to the chemosensory abilities the competition for resources and the cooperation for protection 2 2 5 stochasticity in this work there are four principle sources of randomness the random initial distribution of cells randomness in the cells motion equation in the time step of the division death events and in the realization of the division and death events acceptance rejection 2 2 6 collectives there is a social collective behavior in phytoplankton that is reflected in aggregations formation 2 2 7 observation we will analyze the spatial structure of the aggregations using spatial statistics such as the clark evans index the percentage of the potential groups belonging and the average number of cells inside a group 2 3 details 2 3 1 initialization we initialize our model as follows the initial cells number n 0 250 cells in a the locations are chosen randomly and the model parameters are given in tables 1 and 2 2 3 2 sub models the motion dynamic let n be the number of living motile phytoplankton cells and x t n x t 1 x t 2 x t i x t n the position vector of the n cells at time t the motion of the ith cell i 1 n is given by the following stochastic differential equation 1 dx t i dt j 1 j i n k f a x t i x t j 2 d m db t i dt i 1 n where b t i t 0 is a 3 dimension brownian motion and d m is the diffusion coefficient the drift term in eq 1 describes the resulting attraction exerted on the ith cell due to the interaction of this cell with other cells in the system k is a scaling constant and f a u v is the attraction kernel of the cell in u towards the cell in v it is given by 2 f a u v u v u v u v r 0 u v r 1 1 r 0 r 1 u v this attraction kernel was given for the first time in el saadi 2004 and it bases on ideas involving non uniformity of the concentration fields around cells and considering motile phytoplankton cells having chemosensory capabilities that make them able to sense the presence of other cells in a certain neighborhood this means that attraction forces act over a specific range of sensitivity more precisely a cell at position u is attracted towards the cell at position v if and only if the distance between them is in r 0 r 1 where r 0 is the upper limit of the neutral zone there s no attraction of the cell in u towards the cell in v if the distance between them is below r 0 because of the high concentration of the micro products which inhibits the chemosensory behavior el saadi and bah 2007 there is also no attraction between the cells if the distance between them exceeds r 1 r 1 r 0 where r 1 is the upper limit of the attraction zone and this is due to the fact that the cells are sensory limited el saadi 2004 el saadi and bah 2007 this is a mathematical description of the chemosensory ability of phytoplankton cells that has been biologically documented by jackson 1987 1990 and defined mathematically by el saadi 2004 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2006 2007 to simulate cells motion we use the euler s schema to discretize the sde as follows 3 x t δ t euler i x t i j 1 j i n t k f a x t i x t j δ t euler 2 d m δ t euler ε i i 1 n t where δt euler is the euler time step and ε i is a 3 dimensional standard gaussian variable we considered periodic boundaries for the cell motion the division and death mechanisms let n t t 0 be the number of living phytoplankton cells at time t in this work we consider that n t t 0 is an interactive birth death process we assume that phytoplankton cells reproduce asexually through a binary division by a simple mitosis so a given cell has to choose between two behaviors during its life time either it divides into two identical daughters at its current position or dies without reproduction we use the concept of the cellular local density to define density dependent components of the division and death rates bolker and pacala 1997 dieckmann and law 2000 law et al 2003 the division rate in all this work we consider the division rate d x t i d 1 density dependent to take into account the effect of cells competition for resources 4 d x t i d 0 j 1 j i n t u 1 x t i x t j if j 1 j i n t u 1 x t i x t j d 0 0 otherwise where d 0 0 denotes the maximum division rate and u 1 is the competition kernel eq 4 means that the more the cell has neighbors the more its division process will slow down because of the competition on resources with its neighbors the competition kernel is supposed to be truncated gaussian and is given by 5 u 1 u v d 1 exp u v 2 2 σ u 1 2 if u v h 1 0 otherwise where d 1 0 σ u1 0 and h 1 0 represent respectively the strength the width of the competition and the upper limit of the competition zone plank and law 2015 binny et al 2016 the death rate we propose two variants for the death rate var 1 a density independent death rate m x t i m 0 var 2 a density dependent death rate m x t i given as follows 6 m x t i m p α j 1 j i n t u 2 x t i x t j if j 1 j i n t u 2 x t i x t j m p α otherwise notice that m 0 is the global death rate that is m 0 m p α where m p is the predation rate and α 0 is the intrinsic death rate the latter includes all internal death reasons specific to a cell the term j 1 j i n t u 2 x t i x t j expresses the cooperation effect of all the neighbors of the cell in position x t i in reducing its death rate due to predation u 2 is a cooperative kernel that depends on the distance between two cells 7 u 2 u v m 1 exp u v 2 2 σ u 2 2 if u v h 2 0 otherwise where m 1 0 σ u2 0 and h 2 0 are respectively the strength of the cooperation the width of the cooperation and the upper limit of the cooperation zone the used spatial statistics we use three statistics to analyze the spatial pattern these ones are 1 the 3d clark evans index r t 2 the potential group belonging percentage η t and 3 the aggregation average size m t max the clark evans index it is defined as the ratio r of the observed mean distance to the nearest neighbor r a to the mean distance of a population exhibiting a random pattern r e if r 1 then the distribution is perfectly random if r 1 the pattern is aggregated and finally if r 1 then the distribution is regular this index is given by clark and evans 1979 8 r r a r e r a 1 n i 1 n d i r e 0 55397 ρ 1 3 where d i is the distance to the nearest neighbor of the ith individual and ρ is the density that represents the number of points per unit of volume the potential percentage of cells in groups we consider the following statistic based on the distance to the nearest neighbor 9 η 100 n i 1 n 1 0 a d i this statistic will be used to quantify the potential group belonging percentage in time the value of a 0 has to be small we consider a 11 μm this statistic permits to give an approximation of the number of cells that are in aggregations and also of the number of free cells notice that η may have large values in some particular situations without real groups formation for example when the domain a is full of cells without accumulations that is why the statistic η t must be used together with the clark evans index to give complete information about the spatial structure the average group size we develop the aggregation average size as a function of the instantaneous percentage η t the population size n t and the number of the spatial clusters formed m t as follows 10 m t n t η t 100 m t if m t 0 0 otherwise m t represents the estimated number of cells in a group at time t 3 the used stochastic algorithm we use the acceptance rejection algorithm to simulate the model initiated by fournier and méléard 2004 it has been used in many studies champagnat and méléard 2007 campillo and joannides 2009 fritsch et al 2015 khader 2015 we define the upper bound event rate over the population which represents the sum of the upper division d and death m rates as follows 11 λ d m n d 0 m 0 let t be the date of the last event and n the population size at time t for the next branching time we do 1 calculate the total upper limit population event rate λ 2 generate the waiting time to the next potential event δ t exp λ and the event time t δt 3 update the cells positions that evolve according to eq 3 in t t δ t before any division or death events 4 choose randomly a cell at location x from the population and the choice of the next event division or death is computed respectively according to the probabilities d λ and m λ the division and the death events are computed for each of the two variants of our ibm as follow if the division event occurs the cell will divide into two daughters at the location of the mother with probability d x d 0 if the death event occurs a in var 1 the cell will die without reproduction with probability 1 b in var 2 the cell will die without reproduction with the probability m x m 0 4 the parameter values and tested scenarios table 2 presents the 12 different scenarios to be tested in this study to simulate the demographical process of our ibm we considered real values of phytoplankton for the maximum division rate d 0 and the global death rate m 0 see table 1 on the other hand since the main cause of phytoplankton death is predation and as grazing represents the main process for loss of phytoplankton gutiérrez rodríguez et al 2011 law et al 2018 wohlrab 2013 cuesta et al 2018 we considered that the predation death rate m p has the largest part of the global death rate m 0 that is we take m p 0 18 and the intrinsic death rate α 0 02 biologically α corresponds to the death rate by the programmed cell death pcd that can be induced by environmental stress cell age or nutrient deprivation see bidle 2016 the three scenarios s 1 s 2 and s 3 correspond to variant 1 of our ibm with respectively low medium and high competition strength d 1 for the d 1 parameter values we were inspired by some spatial models devoted to terrestrial plants law et al 2003 since no earlier works giving real or experimental values for phytoplankton competition parameters exist in the literature see bouderbala et al 2018 the weak intensity d 1 0 002 considered in the first scenario s 1 is very close to the one given in law et al 2003 for scenarios s 2 and s 3 we considered two other increasing strengths of competition see table 2 we point that a weak level of competition corresponds to the situation where nutrients and resources are widely available in the medium while a high level of competition represents the case of resource and nutrients deplete for phytoplankton scenarios from s 4 to s 12 concern variant 2 of our ibm and correspond to the different combinations d 1 m 1 obtained with the above three orders of magnitude for the strength of competition and three different levels for the strength of cooperation since the cooperation process has not been modelled before parameter values for this process cannot be found in the existing literature so for our simulation we based on experimental observations dealing with the cooperative behavior in phytoplankton under a predation stress to quantify the degree of magnitude of cooperation and its width many recent biological works abada and segev 2018 duran nebreda and solé 2015 driscoll and travisano 2017 reported that phytoplankton populations often display the characteristics of a multicellular like community rather than a random collection of individuals they communicate cooperate and execute coordinated behaviors the release of signals from some cells which are perceived by other cells culminates in a variety of coordinated actions such as community defense mechanisms hence in our simulation study we considered that the upper limit of the cooperation zone h 2 is equal to the upper limit of the attraction zone r 1 that is h 2 r 1 this constraint expresses the fact that under a predation stress all phytoplankton cells that are present in the attraction zone of a given phytoplankton cell will cooperate with it since they can sense via their chemosensory abilities the signals released by this cell we also considered that cells compete principally within aggregations so it is obvious to take the upper limit of the competition zone smaller than the upper limit of the cooperation zone that is h 1 h 2 indeed competitors for a given cell are only cells that are in its close vicinity while the co operators are the closest cells and also all cells that can communicate with it and sense its warning signals namely the cells that are present in its attraction zone further it was shown that in presence of predators cells can communicate warning signals to a large part of the population triggering community wide defense mechanisms abada and segev 2018 duran nebreda and solé 2015 thus in all our simulations we considered a large value for the upper limit of the cooperation zone h 2 which is equal to the upper limit of the range of attraction r 1 for the cooperation strength m 1 we considered three different orders of magnitude low medium and high that correspond to different degrees of predation stress indeed it has been documented in kapsetaki et al 2016 that different degrees of stress can be observed for different species of predators or phytoplankton also the intensity of the predation stress can vary according to the presence of live predator or only its products filtrates in the absence of the predator himself sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2017 the experimental studies in sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 showed that products of predators stimulate group formation but less than the real presence of predators notice that the 12 scenarios are tested under a large range of attraction r 1 90 μm and a medium diffusion d m 0 0584 μm2 s 1 this set of motion parameters permits the formation of aggregates even if the demographical process is not taken into account see bouderbala et al 2018 that is aggregates can form via only the attraction mechanism between cells due to their chemosensory capacities the widths σ ui i 1 2 in table 1 are respectively related to the h i by the relation h i 3σ ui i 1 2 with the h i representing the limits beyond which the kernels will be null we run 10 simulations for each scenario the spatial statistics r η and n for each scenario are averages of the 10 repetitions the death and division mean rates of a population in a simulation are calculated as follows m t save 1 n t save i 1 n t save m x t save i and d t save 1 n t save i 1 n t save d x t save i the division and death mean rates presented in the simulation results represent the averages of 10 repetitions of the above death and division mean rates 5 simulation results and statistical analysis in this part we present the results obtained from the simulation of the 12 scenarios 5 1 effect of the strength of competition variant 1 for the three scenarios s 1 s 2 and s 3 of variant 1 the clark evans index and the potential group belonging percentage confirm the formation of aggregations however the quality and the intensity of the aggregation process vary according to the different magnitudes of the competition strength we clearly observe that the best aggregation holds for a low competition strength whereas the aggregation becomes weak when the strength of competition is high fig 3 a and b for a low competition strength s 1 the average aggregations size at the end of the simulation is higher than 225 cells per aggregation while it is about 69 cells per aggregation for a medium competition strength s 2 and about 17 cells per aggregation for a high competition strength s 3 see fig 5 a c an increase of the strength of competition means a decrease of the division mean rate which slows up the cell reproduction process while death occurs at a constant rate m 0 0 2 this affects negatively sizes of aggregations compare between s 1 s 2 and s 3 in fig 5a c the potential percentage of cells in groups fig 3a and also the population size fig 6 a also the decay rate of the division mean rate differs between the three scenarios see s 1 s 2 and s 3 in fig 4 a c higher is the strength of competition rapid and stronger is the decrease of the division mean rate fig 4a c we also observe that under a high competition s 3 fig 4c the division mean rate decreases below the death mean rate it attains the value 0 119 which induces a decline in the local density and thus a reduction of the competition effect hence the division mean rate changes its variation direction and starts to increase showing some fluctuations see s 3 in fig 4c due do the changes in the competition effect under the variation of the division mean rate the latter attains the value 0 191 at the end of the simulation notice that a stability is observed in the population dynamic for the scenario of weak competition s 1 when the division mean rate stabilizes around 0 2 d 1 which is the value of the death mean rate fig 4a whereas an almost equilibrium with small fluctuations appears when the competition strength increases fig 4b 5 2 the simultaneous effect of the strengths of competition and cooperation variant 2 5 2 1 on the spatial distribution spatial distributions in fig 2 show aggregations formation in all scenarios from s 4 to s 12 but we observe that the aggregation process is better under a low competition level s 4 s 5 and s 6 and the best aggregation is obtained under a low competition with medium to high cooperation s 5 and s 6 while the worst one is obtained under the scenarios of high competition with low to medium cooperation s 10 and s 11 spatial statistics in figs 3c h confirm these observations we also observe that the competition strength has a negative impact on aggregations see s 10 s 11 and s 12 in fig 2 whereas the strength of cooperation has a positive impact on the spatial distribution fig 2 the sizes of the formed groups fig 5a c and the potential percentage of cells that are in aggregations fig 3c e the positive impact of cooperation on the aggregating pattern is more visible when competition is high see fig 3h fig 2 illustrates well this observation through the differences in the spatial patterns obtained from the respective scenarios the scenario of high competition with no cooperation s 3 the scenario of high competition with low cooperation s 10 and the scenario of high competition with high cooperation s 12 5 2 2 on the division and death mean rates dynamics fig 4d l summarizes the simultaneous dynamics of the death and division mean rates for the nine scenarios s 4 to s 12 from scenarios s 4 s 7 and s 10 fig 4d g and j respectively we can see that a low cooperation has a negligible effect on the death mean rate regardless the competition level the death mean rate remains almost constant during the simulation period while a high cooperation reduces significantly the death mean rate see s 6 s 9 and s 12 indeed for a high cooperation we can observe that the death mean rate reaches its minimum 0 020 under a low and medium competition s 6 fig 4f and s 9 fig 4j and attains the value 0 022 under a high competition s 12 fig 4l which means that death by predation is inhibited in these scenarios from scenarios s 5 s 8 and s 11 we notice that a medium cooperation strength is very sensible to the competition level fig 4e shows that a medium cooperation has a remarkable effect on the death mean rate when competition is weak the death mean rate decreases in s 5 from the value 0 2 to 0 02 see fig 4e that is a medium cooperation can stop the predation loss when competition is weak however the effect of a medium cooperation in reducing the predation death rate weakens when competition increases the minimum value attained by the death mean rate is 0 124 under a medium competition s 8 fig 4h and 0 177 under a high competition s 11 on another hand fig 4 shows that under a low or medium competition the division mean rate decreases until to reach a steady state at which the values of the division and the death mean rates become superimposed see scenarios s 4 to s 6 however there are differences between the different scenarios regarding the equilibrium value reached by the death mean rate which is also the equilibrium value for the division mean rate and the time to reach this equilibrium indeed under a low competition level when cooperation is low the death mean rate is almost constant 0 177 while the division mean rate decreases slowly under the weak effect of competition till to reach the equilibrium value see s 4 in fig 4d more the cooperation is high the death mean rate decreases more rapidly to achieve an equilibrium value that is its minimum 0 02 this decline in the death mean rate increases the local density which amplifies the competition effect and as a result the division mean rate decreases rapidly to reach a steady state at the equilibrium value of the death mean rate in fig 4 we notice that for s 6 rapidly is reached a steady state under which the death and division mean rates have the minimum value 0 02 while in s 5 the death mean rate declines less rapidly and attains its equilibrium later than in s 6 as a consequence the division mean rate takes more time in s 5 to achieve the equilibrium death mean rate value 0 02 and we can see that at the end of the simulation the steady state in s 5 is not completely reached since the division mean rate is a little greater than 0 02 it is equal to 0 023 for the case of medium competition since a weak cooperation has a negligible effect on the death mean rate the time variation of the death and division mean rates in s 7 fig 4g is almost identical to the one obtained in s 2 fig 4b with almost the same equilibrium value in the two scenarios when the cooperation strength increases the death mean rate decreases more to reach a steady state notice that the death mean rate equilibrium value for a high cooperation s 9 is smaller than in the case of medium cooperation s 8 furthermore since in this case the competition strength is greater than in the case of a low competition the division mean rate decreases more rapidly to reach its equilibrium value 0 12 in s 8 and 0 031 in s 9 in the case of high competition the time variation of the death and division mean rates in the scenario of low cooperation s 10 resembles to the one in scenario s 3 at the end of the simulation the mean death rate value is 0 198 while the division mean rate attains 0 167 when the cooperation is medium s 11 the death mean rate decreases but less than under low or medium competitions the small reduction of predation loss due to the medium cooperation has the effect of increasing more the high competition and as a result the division mean rate in s 11 declines strongly and rapidly below the death rate and attains 0 107 this induces a significant decrease in the local density which weakens the competition process for a certain time it results an increase of the division mean rate in s 11 till to approach the mean death rate at the end of the simulation time the death mean rate is 0 183 while the division mean rate attains 0 168 in the scenario of high cooperation s 12 because of the high effect of cooperation the death mean rate decreases strongly and the equilibrium death mean rate is much smaller than in s 11 in fact a high cooperation strength decreases significantly the death mean rate see in s 12 fig 4 that from the 5th day the death mean rate decreases to stabilize around the value 0 025 therefore in addition to the high effect of competition the significant decrease of the death mean rate under the high effect of cooperation induces a significant raise in the local density which amplifies again the high effect of competition as a result the division mean rate declines strongly till to reach rapidly the equilibrium death mean rate 5 2 3 on the aggregation average sizes fig 5a c gives the average groups sizes obtained at the end of the 20th day under the simultaneous variation of the strengths of competition and cooperation they clearly show the negative impact of the competition strength on the aggregation average size we also observe the effect of cooperation in increasing the groups sizes under each competition level especially when the strength of cooperation is high s 6 s 9 and s 12 in fig 5a c we notice that when competition is weak the average group s size in the scenario of a medium cooperation s 5 is a little greater than in the scenario of a high cooperation s 6 this is due to the fact that at the end of the 20th day the division mean rate in s 5 has not completely reached the death mean rate equilibrium value 0 02 while in s 6 the division mean rate equilibrium value 0 02 was attained earlier before the end of the simulation hence the loss of cells in an aggregation is little more in s 6 than in s 5 we also remark that under a high competition the average group s size is almost identical in the scenarios of weak cooperation s 10 and medium cooperation s 11 this can be justified by the fact that at the end of the simulation the death and division mean rates as well as the population dynamic observed in s 11 are close to the ones in s 10 5 2 4 on the population dynamic fig 6b d shows the population dynamic in all scenarios from s 4 to s 12 the population size decreases with the increase of the competition strength see fig 6a however under each level of competition we observe an increase of the population size with the increase of the cooperation strength the population sizes are higher under a low competition level s 4 s 5 and s 6 fig 6b and the highest size is obtained under the scenario of weak competition with high cooperation s 6 see fig 6b for the scenarios s 4 to s 9 stability in the population dynamic takes place once the division mean rate reaches the death mean rate and stabilizes at this value the different population sizes observed at equilibrium are consistent with the simultaneous dynamics of the division and the death mean rates presented in the precedent subsubsection 6 discussion and concluding remarks the aim of this work was to understand how motile phytoplankton cells form groups under predation stress and how resource competition and the anti predation cooperation impact on the aggregating process the group size and the phytoplankton population for this purpose we developed an ibm that take into account small scale biological processes for the phytoplankton cells that are cells motion and cells division and death the cells motion includes two components a molecular diffusion and a drift considered density dependent to take into account the attraction mechanism between cells due to their chemosensory abilities cells division was also considered density dependent to include a competition behavior between cells that slows up their division rate while the death rate was density dependent to integrate the anti predator cooperation between cells that reduces the predation death rate competition on the resources and predation are the most important selective pressures for phytoplankton and many scientists try to perform some experiments to understand how those two selective forces will generate adaptive trade off of the cells inside the groups see for instance boraas et al 1998 it was shown in general that these processes have important impact on the morphology of the multicellular organisms van gestel and tarnita 2017 such as the phytoplankton groups however no model was made to understand how the relationship between competition and predation will act on the formation of the groups and how the groups sizes will change accordingly our ibm addressed this question we called variant 1 of the ibm the cases for which the cooperation strength is null which means that cooperation is not taken into account and variant 2 the version that takes into account the cooperation we point that variant 1 is not biologically meaningful since we work under the hypothesis of presence of predators which implies existence of a cooperative behavior smayda 1997 lurling and beekman 2006 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 so variant 1 is just used as a reference version to which we can quantify the effects of cooperation for the different levels of competition it is important to mention that the construction of the ibm was based on the biological description of the phytoplankton behavior under predation stress and the simulation of the ibm was constrained by experimental observations and real parameter values the simulation of our ibm shows that predator induced groups in the motile phytoplankton cells form from two mechanisms coming together driven by the cells motion in which the attraction mechanism due to chemosensory abilities in these cells is enhanced when predators are present and remaining together explained by the birth death process including both competition and cooperation to be more precise our ibm suggests that in motile phytoplankton cells groups form under predation stress as follows a stress predation stimulates phytoplankton cells to cooperate in order to protect themselves generally predators can engulf single cells but not large cell aggregates as a result the cells cooperative behavior triggers and in the model this is reflected through considering on one hand a large attraction zone which will be included in the cooperation zone in which independent unicellular cells interact communicate and then aggregate and on another hand by including the cooperation term in the death rate expressing that all cells present in the cooperation zone contribute by their aggregation in the reduction of the predation death inside aggregations cells divide at a rate depending on the resource competition which increases or reduces the aggregations sizes and the attractive force prevents the daughter cells to leave the group after division the strength of competition is linked to the availability of resources and the efficiency of the cooperation in reducing the predation loss is governed by the cooperation strength as a response to the intensity of predation stress our ibm was simulated for all combinations that cross different levels of competitions with those of cooperation all the simulations have shown that phytoplankton cells aggregate under predation stress but the quality of the aggregation the sizes of aggregates and the phytoplankton population size differ according to the levels of both competition and cooperation simulations have shown that a high cooperation between cells leads rapidly to an aggregation process that can completely prevent cells being grazed regardless the level of resource competition a medium cooperation prevents predation less quickly and only if competition is weak but when competition increases the aggregation process is not so successful and loss by predation is just reduced but not completely inhibited a weak cooperation has a negligible effect in reducing predation loss regardless the level of competition globally our study showed that although resource competition impacts negatively the aggregating pattern the sizes of groups and the population size cooperation between cells plays an important role in maintaining the aggregation process and keeping the groups and population sizes at a correct level especially when the cooperation strength is high this study also helps the understanding of the complex small scale relationship that exists between competition and cooperation indeed since both of the competition and the cooperation processes are density dependent they interact through the local density as follows cooperation by reducing the predation death rate amplifies the competition process a decrease in the death rate induces an increase in the local density involved in the competition process on the other hand competition by slowing down the division rate reduces the local density of phytoplankton cells involved in the cooperation process which weakens the cooperation effect when the latter is low or medium in this case the attraction induced aggregation will not be efficient to sharply reduce the predation rate but when cooperation is strong it reduces significantly the death rate till to inhibit grazing which leads to significant increased groups that will not be much affected by the division rate decrease due to the high competition the loss of cells due to a high competition is very negligible compared to the predation loss by this the present simulation study explains rigorously how the cooperation process can lead to a good aggregation under a high competition from the biological point of view we think that our model can provide a response to the ecological question on how multicellular groups in motile species of phytoplankton form under predation stress by suggesting the two combined operators coming and remaining together the first is explained through the diffusion and the attraction mechanisms by which independent cells can aggregate and the second is through the birth death process and the attraction force by which the cells divide inside the group with daughter cells remaining in the group after division the sizes of groups and the phytoplankton population vary according to the trade off between the benefits reduction predation risks and the costs slowing down the reproduction process of being in aggregations some experimental works on the group formation under predation stress in motile and non motile phytoplankton species support our finding lurling and beekman 2006 harris 2009 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 for instance it was demonstrated that the algae chlamydomonas which are motile species of phytoplankton can form groups by both remaining together after division and aggregating lurling and beekman 2006 harris 2009 sathe and durand 2016 recently kapsetaki et al 2016 and kapsetaki et al 2017 showed that freshwater algae form multicellular groups in response to the presence of predators by both staying together and coming together also many of our simulation results are in agreement with some experimental results obtained on phytoplankton group s formation under predation stress for instance in zhu et al 2016 the authors studied predation induced groups of some alga under deficient resource they showed that along the reduction of phosphorous concentration or light intensity predator induced groups formation of s obliquus showed a decreasing trend and the defensive colony formation was impaired under insufficient resources this result validates our finding on the negative effect of a high competition on the cooperation process and its impact on the aggregation process also authors in kapsetaki et al 2016 and kapsetaki et al 2017 have investigated experimental studies on how algal species form groups in response to the presence of a predator they examined the group formation caused first by the live predator and then by just the predator products these can be products released from the predators or even intracellular products released from dead predator cells the authors found that the presence of live predators or predator products led to increased group formation see fig 3 in kapsetaki et al 2016 but the proportion of cells in groups is greater in the presence of live predator than in the presence of only predator products see fig 3 in kapsetaki et al 2017 these experimental results confirm our simulation results on the aggregates formation under predation stress whatever the level of cooperation and on the positive effect of cooperation on the aggregation process namely that more the predation stress is strong which corresponds to a strong cooperation more the aggregation process is better in kapsetaki et al 2016 the authors also found that for some types of algae the population density decreases under predation stress while not for other species this experimental result is in consensus with our simulation result stating that efficiency of the predator induced aggregation in preventing grazing relies on the intensity of the predation stress represented by the cooperation strength in our modelling which varies with phytoplankton species and or predators species on another hand this study showed that resource competition is a very important process that helps the multicellular groups to not expand into infinite we showed that resource competition plays an important role in regularizing the groups sizes and when the latter become too high in case where the anti predator aggregation is so successful that grazing is inhibited competition can reduce the group size since it acts on the reduction of the growth which favorites the mortality the experimental work of sathe and durand 2016 support this result since these authors observed in their experimental study that once groups formed and cells in groups were protected some cells within a group died the authors even expressed their surprise about this death within aggregates and did not understand the reason of such a death since cells in groups are protected from predators our study explains that the reason of this death is a high resource competition and based on our modelling we can deduce that the closest cells to the center will divide less since they have high local density compared to the others and so their chance of dying via the programmed cell death is higher compared to the farthest cells to the center ratcliff et al 2013 showed that the majority of the apoptotic cells are found close to the center of the group a similar result about the relation between multicellular group size with the mortality was also presented in duran nebreda and solé 2015 from the modelling point of view we stress on the fact that the idea of quantifying the cooperation behavior in phytoplankton is new in both mathematical and biological literatures for phytoplankton and modelling cooperation at the individual level was not made in any previous works competition was used in previous works but in almost all cases at the macroscopic level we mentioned in the introduction the basic competition models of phytoplankton very few works on resource competition in phytoplankton were made at the individual level hellweger and bucci 2009 present a review of such existing ibms and hellweger and kianirad 2007 evaluate three different ibms modeling the growth or division process on an individual basis but to our knowledge no work integrated the spatial structure to study the agent agent interaction in the competition process such a way of modelling competition at the phytoplankton individual level appeared in bouderbala et al 2018 in conclusion this whole study was carried under the hypothesis of the presence of predation stress in the medium our ibm modelling approach provides a response to the question of group formation in the motile phytoplankton cells in presence of both predation stress and resource competition it also helps the understanding of how the motile phytoplankton cells deal with the increase in the competitive and grazing pressures through the formation of groups we point that the model can also be used under the hypothesis that no predator is present with the following changes the upper limit of the attraction zone must be smaller than under a predation stress see bouderbala et al 2018 and both of the cooperation strength and the predation death rate must be null m 1 0 and m p 0 since no predation stress exists we think also that our modelling approach can be extended to a more general context to show that the trade off between the availability of resources and defence from predators can be an important mechanism leading to swarming behavior of for instance fish krill see e g brierley and cox 2010 for krill swarms or insects acknowledgements we would like to thank the editor and the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments which

help in the programming part 
25156,the phytoplankton s spatial aggregation is a very important phenomenon that can give responses to many questions such as the passage from the unicellularity to the multicellularity in this work we are interested by predator induced aggregations in motile phytoplankton our aim is to bring through a simulation study some explanations on how these groups form and analyze the simultaneous effect of both resource competition and anti predation cooperation on the groups formation process for this purpose we developed a 3d individual based model ibm that takes into account small scale biological processes for the phytoplankton cells that are 1 motion described by a stochastic differential equation in which the drift term is density dependent to take into account the attraction mechanism between cells due to their chemosensory abilities and the dispersal term representing the diffusion of cells in water 2 a density dependent birth death process to describe the demographical process in phytoplankton cells in the latter division and death rates were considered density dependent to include a local competition for resources that slows up the cell s division and a local cooperation in phytoplankton that reduces the cell s predation death we implemented the ibm and considered several scenarios that combine three different levels of resource competition with three different intensities of cooperation the different scenarios were tested using real parameter values for phytoplankton the simulation of the ibm showed that phytoplankton cells form aggregations via the coming together mechanism driven by the cell s motion process in which the attraction mechanism is enhanced by the cooperation behavior the latter is a response to the predation stress after that groups grow through the remaining together mechanism which is a consequence of the division death process and also the attraction mechanism which prevents the daughter cells from leaving the group after division also the simulation of the different scenarios highlights the role of cooperation in the formation of aggregates and shows that although resource competition impairs the aggregation process and the group size cooperation plays an important role in sustaining the aggregating process and when it is strong the induced aggregation process is so successful that it completely prevents cells being grazed and both group and population sizes are maintained at a good level keywords individual based model predator induced aggregation chemosensory ability density dependent birth death process resource competition anti predation cooperation 1 introduction phytoplankton aggregation is a complex biological phenomena that plays a significant role in the primary production and the marine life cycle the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the aggregations formation is very important and can give response to many questions such those related to the development and the evolution of the multicellularity ratcliff et al 2013 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2017 van gestel and tarnita 2017 the reasons behind groups formation in phytoplankton can be social such as protection from predator smayda 1997 boraas et al 1998 lurling and beekman 2006 long et al 2007 sathe and durand 2016 the search of prey spero and morée 1981 the performance of sexual reproduction through gametes fission hadjivasiliou et al 2015 or environmental the process of turbulence durham et al 2013 and the non homogeneous distribution of the resources mellard et al 2012 specifically many works have demonstrated that motile phytoplankton species are more patchy than the non motile ones mouritsen and richardson 2003 durham et al 2013 but very few works were made to describe or and understand the mechanism generating this patchiness and to explain how these cells interact with each other and with their micro environment hutchinson 1961 durham et al 2013 sathe and durand 2016 in this work we focus particularly on the study of the aggregation mechanism induced by the predation risks for motile phytoplankton cells the search of protection from predators is generally considered one of the most important reasons of group formation hamilton 1971 krause and ruxton 2002 spieler 2003 johannesen et al 2014 some experimental studies have shown that the survival rate increases with the increase of the aggregation size foster and treherne 1981 spieler 2003 indeed individuals inside groups can have the benefit either from the avoidance effect since the predators have less chances to find a group of preys than one of many single preys turner and pitcher 1986 krause and ruxton 2002 or from the dilution effect because the predator can only eat a fraction of a group of preys so the larger the group the lower is the chance that a particular individual will be the attacked one krause and ruxton 2002 turner and pitcher 1986 explained that the two precedent effects must be in combination to have a real positive effect called the attack abatement effect on the prey survival some experimental works were made to demonstrate the anti predation aggregation strategies for phytoplankton cells smayda 1997 boraas et al 1998 lurling and beekman 2006 lürling and van donk 2000 ratcliff et al 2013 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 it was observed that many species of motile and non motile phytoplankton form multicellular groups in response to predators however it is not well known if these groups form by daughter cells remaining together after division or by potentially unrelated cells aggregating together for example boraas et al 1998 and lürling and van donk 2000 suggested that group formation in the non motile species chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus was via daughter cells remaining together after division in contrast sathe and durand 2016 demonstrated that the motile species chlamydomonas come together when they are under predation stress these authors suggest that these species of phytoplankton cells respond to the chemicals released by the predator kairomones that give them the green light to aggregate fig 1 in their experimental study the predator is a flagellated protist called peranema that can predate on small single cells but not on large cell aggregations recently kapsetaki and co authors kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 showed a clear and direct fitness benefit of forming groups to avoid predation for some non motile species as a combination between coming together and remaining together after division they observed that the non motile cells s obliquus form predator induced groups within 1 h which is faster than their division time indicating that in a first stage cells aggregate by coming together on the other hand competition for resources also plays a central role on the spatial distribution of phytoplankton cells either at the macroscopic level klausmeier and litchman 2001 huisman et al 2006 litchman 2007 yoshiyama et al 2009 mellard et al 2012 or at the individual level see for instance hellweger and kianirad 2007 fredrick et al 2013 bouderbala et al 2018 and when the group size starts to increase the competition inside the group increases as well bouderbala et al 2018 in general very few experiments were made to study the compromise between the benefits of being in aggregations through the anti predation strategies and the costs of competition inside aggregations boraas et al 1998 grand and dill 1999 bednekoff and lima 2004 and to our knowledge no model on phytoplankton cells was made to address this ecological question and to show the mutual impact of resource competition and anti predator cooperation and its effect on the predator induced spatial aggregations in this work we propose to study the process of groups formation in motile phytoplankton cells under predation stress and to analyze the impact of the simultaneous effect of competition and cooperation in phytoplankton cells on the predator induced spatial aggregations for this purpose we adopt the individual based modelling approach grimm 1999 grimm et al 2006 2010 deangelis and grimm 2013 individual based models ibm s are models that describe characteristics and dynamics observed at the level of individual organisms and describe the changes in their state they are considered as one of the most useful tools for modelling complex systems since they permit to simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple individuals in an attempt to re create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena also they can be applicable to many problems for which the mathematical treatment is hard despite their usefulness only few ibms were conceived to study phytoplankton dynamics in general and phytoplankton aggregation in particular el saadi 2004 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2006 2007 rudnicki and wieczorek 2006 bouderbala et al 2018 so in this work we develop a 3 dimensional individual based model ibm that takes into account small scale biological processes for the phytoplankton cells such as motion and the demographical process the motion is described by the fundamental principle of dynamics grünbaum and okubo 1994 niwa 1994 okubo and levin 2013 that has been applied to phytoplankton cells by el saadi 2004 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2006 2007 using a stochastic differential equation in which the drift term describes the spatial attraction toward the surrounding cells while the dispersal term represents the cell diffusion to describe the attraction mechanism between phytoplankton cells we use the chemotaxis approach that emphasizes biological small scale mechanisms this approach states that motile algae such as dinoflagellates and many other protists flagellates have chemosensory abilities that would be useless if the oceanic environment was chemically homogeneous levandowsky and hauser 1978 spero and morée 1981 fitt 1985 spero 1985 jackson 1987 bell and mitchell 1972 and azam and ammerman 1984 reported that phytoplankton cells excrete some extracellular products and defined the concept of the phycosphere a highly concentrated region in extracellular products that forms around the phytoplankton cell via the chemo attraction induced by its phycosphere a phytoplankton cell attracts its neighboring cells that move towards it el saadi 2004 adioui et al 2005 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2006 2007 for the demographical process we consider a stochastic birth death process the division rate is considered density dependent to include the competition effect in such a way that a cell with higher number of neighbors will have a lower division rate this means that a competitive environment will slow down the division process for the death rate we present two variants the first one by considering the death rate constant and the second by considering the death rate density dependent to include the cooperation behavior between cells as an anti predation strategy we should mention that the cooperation effect is quantified through the death rate which is considered as a decreasing function of the local density this means that a higher number of neighbors will reduce the death rate to simulate our ibm we use monte carlo acceptance rejection algorithm that was initiated by fournier and méléard 2004 to simulate a stochastic ibm that includes a competition effect we organize the paper as follows in section 2 we present a detailed description of the ibm using the odd s protocol overview design concepts details in section 3 the stochastic algorithm is proposed and in section 4 the different scenarios to be tested and parameter values are presented and discussed section 5 is devoted to the simulation results and in section 6 we discuss the results and conclude with some remarks 2 the ibm odd s protocol in this section we adopt the odd protocol overview design concepts details grimm et al 2006 2010 to develop our ibm and for the simulations we use gama platform version gama 1 8 release candidate 1 rc1 that is a modelling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit agent based simulations developed by the international research unit ummisco 2 1 overview 2 1 1 purpose as we mentioned in the introduction we develop a 3 dimensional ibm to study the process of groups formation in motile phytoplankton cells under predation stress and to identify the small scale dynamics that are responsible for the emergence of these aggregations also we aim to analyze the mutual effect of resource competition and anti predation cooperation on the groups formation 2 1 2 entities state variables and scale for the proposed model the entities are phytoplankton cells and each agent has its own attributes we present here only the variable attributes that are the position that evolves in time according to the agent s motion dynamic the division rate the death rate and the nearest neighbor we work under a cubic microscopic 3d environment a ℝ 3 with 500 μm as side length the waiting time δt d is considered random and simulated through the acceptance rejection algorithm see section 3 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling each cell moves in the spatial environment a through its motion equation 1 we consider also a stochastic demography through a birth death process in which each cell can disappear from the space without dividing or divide into two daughters the division process is managed in the simulation as follows the mother cell gives birth to two daughters and disappears just after the two daughters are placed at the location of their mother at the moment of division for the simulation of the ibm we use three time steps see in fritsch and campillo 2017 the global stochastic time step δt that is random and used to compute the next division or death events the saving time step δt save that is deterministic and used to regularly calculate the different statistics n t save r t save η t save m t save and d t save at time t save and the euler time step δt euler that is used to update the cells locations by using eq 3 δt euler h where h is a constant section 3 is dedicated to the algorithm description we undertake our simulations by choosing the stopping simulation time t max equal to the last saving time and by considering that the saving time step δt save is a multiple of the euler constant step h finally we consider that if the next branching time is higher than t max so no division and death will be simulated and only the cells locations are updated until reaching t max 2 2 design concepts 2 2 1 basic principles our model takes into account three small scale mechanisms observed at the scale of phytoplankton cells that are motion competition and cooperation 1 modeling phytoplankton motion we consider the motion equation of the ibm of el saadi el saadi 2004 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2007 in a 3 dimensional environment we recall that in this model phytoplankton cells move according to a stochastic differential equation in which the drift term takes into account the chemo attraction between cells and the diffusion term models the diffusion of cells 2 modeling phytoplankton competition for resources we were inspired by some works made on terrestrial plants bolker and pacala 1997 dieckmann and law 2000 law et al 2003 that use the concept of the local density in these works competition acts on the increase of the death rate in this work we consider that competition affects the division rate and by this give a new mathematical formulation of the cellular division rate as a function of the local competition on the resources we assume that each cell is negatively affected by the presence of its neighbors and hence the cellular division rate is an increasing function of the distance separating the cells and a decreasing function of the number of the surrounding cells 3 modeling phytoplankton cooperation we base on previous experiments demonstrating that some phytoplankton cells develop an aggregation strategy what we call an anti predation cooperation when they are under a predation stress smayda 1997 boraas et al 1998 lurling and beekman 2006 long et al 2007 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 more precisely sathe and durand 2016 demonstrated that the chlamydomonas cells which are species of motile phytoplankton aggregate in the presence of predators or even the filtrate culture of predators they suggested that phytoplankton cells can detect the presence of predators since they are able to sense some chemicals released by a predator we translate this social behaviour among phytoplankton by modelling the death rate as a decreasing function of the local cooperation in all this work we are supposing the presence of predation stress that can be physical or culture filtrate 2 2 2 emergence we analyze the spatial emergent structure of phytoplankton cells i e whether it is aggregated or not according to the variation of demographic parameters also we study some features related to the groups proprieties such as their size 2 2 3 sensing a cell can sense its attracting neighbors if it is present in their attraction zone also each cell can sense its local competitors and collaborators 2 2 4 interaction in this work we have three types of interactions the attraction between cells due to the chemosensory abilities the competition for resources and the cooperation for protection 2 2 5 stochasticity in this work there are four principle sources of randomness the random initial distribution of cells randomness in the cells motion equation in the time step of the division death events and in the realization of the division and death events acceptance rejection 2 2 6 collectives there is a social collective behavior in phytoplankton that is reflected in aggregations formation 2 2 7 observation we will analyze the spatial structure of the aggregations using spatial statistics such as the clark evans index the percentage of the potential groups belonging and the average number of cells inside a group 2 3 details 2 3 1 initialization we initialize our model as follows the initial cells number n 0 250 cells in a the locations are chosen randomly and the model parameters are given in tables 1 and 2 2 3 2 sub models the motion dynamic let n be the number of living motile phytoplankton cells and x t n x t 1 x t 2 x t i x t n the position vector of the n cells at time t the motion of the ith cell i 1 n is given by the following stochastic differential equation 1 dx t i dt j 1 j i n k f a x t i x t j 2 d m db t i dt i 1 n where b t i t 0 is a 3 dimension brownian motion and d m is the diffusion coefficient the drift term in eq 1 describes the resulting attraction exerted on the ith cell due to the interaction of this cell with other cells in the system k is a scaling constant and f a u v is the attraction kernel of the cell in u towards the cell in v it is given by 2 f a u v u v u v u v r 0 u v r 1 1 r 0 r 1 u v this attraction kernel was given for the first time in el saadi 2004 and it bases on ideas involving non uniformity of the concentration fields around cells and considering motile phytoplankton cells having chemosensory capabilities that make them able to sense the presence of other cells in a certain neighborhood this means that attraction forces act over a specific range of sensitivity more precisely a cell at position u is attracted towards the cell at position v if and only if the distance between them is in r 0 r 1 where r 0 is the upper limit of the neutral zone there s no attraction of the cell in u towards the cell in v if the distance between them is below r 0 because of the high concentration of the micro products which inhibits the chemosensory behavior el saadi and bah 2007 there is also no attraction between the cells if the distance between them exceeds r 1 r 1 r 0 where r 1 is the upper limit of the attraction zone and this is due to the fact that the cells are sensory limited el saadi 2004 el saadi and bah 2007 this is a mathematical description of the chemosensory ability of phytoplankton cells that has been biologically documented by jackson 1987 1990 and defined mathematically by el saadi 2004 el saadi and arino 2006 el saadi and bah 2006 2007 to simulate cells motion we use the euler s schema to discretize the sde as follows 3 x t δ t euler i x t i j 1 j i n t k f a x t i x t j δ t euler 2 d m δ t euler ε i i 1 n t where δt euler is the euler time step and ε i is a 3 dimensional standard gaussian variable we considered periodic boundaries for the cell motion the division and death mechanisms let n t t 0 be the number of living phytoplankton cells at time t in this work we consider that n t t 0 is an interactive birth death process we assume that phytoplankton cells reproduce asexually through a binary division by a simple mitosis so a given cell has to choose between two behaviors during its life time either it divides into two identical daughters at its current position or dies without reproduction we use the concept of the cellular local density to define density dependent components of the division and death rates bolker and pacala 1997 dieckmann and law 2000 law et al 2003 the division rate in all this work we consider the division rate d x t i d 1 density dependent to take into account the effect of cells competition for resources 4 d x t i d 0 j 1 j i n t u 1 x t i x t j if j 1 j i n t u 1 x t i x t j d 0 0 otherwise where d 0 0 denotes the maximum division rate and u 1 is the competition kernel eq 4 means that the more the cell has neighbors the more its division process will slow down because of the competition on resources with its neighbors the competition kernel is supposed to be truncated gaussian and is given by 5 u 1 u v d 1 exp u v 2 2 σ u 1 2 if u v h 1 0 otherwise where d 1 0 σ u1 0 and h 1 0 represent respectively the strength the width of the competition and the upper limit of the competition zone plank and law 2015 binny et al 2016 the death rate we propose two variants for the death rate var 1 a density independent death rate m x t i m 0 var 2 a density dependent death rate m x t i given as follows 6 m x t i m p α j 1 j i n t u 2 x t i x t j if j 1 j i n t u 2 x t i x t j m p α otherwise notice that m 0 is the global death rate that is m 0 m p α where m p is the predation rate and α 0 is the intrinsic death rate the latter includes all internal death reasons specific to a cell the term j 1 j i n t u 2 x t i x t j expresses the cooperation effect of all the neighbors of the cell in position x t i in reducing its death rate due to predation u 2 is a cooperative kernel that depends on the distance between two cells 7 u 2 u v m 1 exp u v 2 2 σ u 2 2 if u v h 2 0 otherwise where m 1 0 σ u2 0 and h 2 0 are respectively the strength of the cooperation the width of the cooperation and the upper limit of the cooperation zone the used spatial statistics we use three statistics to analyze the spatial pattern these ones are 1 the 3d clark evans index r t 2 the potential group belonging percentage η t and 3 the aggregation average size m t max the clark evans index it is defined as the ratio r of the observed mean distance to the nearest neighbor r a to the mean distance of a population exhibiting a random pattern r e if r 1 then the distribution is perfectly random if r 1 the pattern is aggregated and finally if r 1 then the distribution is regular this index is given by clark and evans 1979 8 r r a r e r a 1 n i 1 n d i r e 0 55397 ρ 1 3 where d i is the distance to the nearest neighbor of the ith individual and ρ is the density that represents the number of points per unit of volume the potential percentage of cells in groups we consider the following statistic based on the distance to the nearest neighbor 9 η 100 n i 1 n 1 0 a d i this statistic will be used to quantify the potential group belonging percentage in time the value of a 0 has to be small we consider a 11 μm this statistic permits to give an approximation of the number of cells that are in aggregations and also of the number of free cells notice that η may have large values in some particular situations without real groups formation for example when the domain a is full of cells without accumulations that is why the statistic η t must be used together with the clark evans index to give complete information about the spatial structure the average group size we develop the aggregation average size as a function of the instantaneous percentage η t the population size n t and the number of the spatial clusters formed m t as follows 10 m t n t η t 100 m t if m t 0 0 otherwise m t represents the estimated number of cells in a group at time t 3 the used stochastic algorithm we use the acceptance rejection algorithm to simulate the model initiated by fournier and méléard 2004 it has been used in many studies champagnat and méléard 2007 campillo and joannides 2009 fritsch et al 2015 khader 2015 we define the upper bound event rate over the population which represents the sum of the upper division d and death m rates as follows 11 λ d m n d 0 m 0 let t be the date of the last event and n the population size at time t for the next branching time we do 1 calculate the total upper limit population event rate λ 2 generate the waiting time to the next potential event δ t exp λ and the event time t δt 3 update the cells positions that evolve according to eq 3 in t t δ t before any division or death events 4 choose randomly a cell at location x from the population and the choice of the next event division or death is computed respectively according to the probabilities d λ and m λ the division and the death events are computed for each of the two variants of our ibm as follow if the division event occurs the cell will divide into two daughters at the location of the mother with probability d x d 0 if the death event occurs a in var 1 the cell will die without reproduction with probability 1 b in var 2 the cell will die without reproduction with the probability m x m 0 4 the parameter values and tested scenarios table 2 presents the 12 different scenarios to be tested in this study to simulate the demographical process of our ibm we considered real values of phytoplankton for the maximum division rate d 0 and the global death rate m 0 see table 1 on the other hand since the main cause of phytoplankton death is predation and as grazing represents the main process for loss of phytoplankton gutiérrez rodríguez et al 2011 law et al 2018 wohlrab 2013 cuesta et al 2018 we considered that the predation death rate m p has the largest part of the global death rate m 0 that is we take m p 0 18 and the intrinsic death rate α 0 02 biologically α corresponds to the death rate by the programmed cell death pcd that can be induced by environmental stress cell age or nutrient deprivation see bidle 2016 the three scenarios s 1 s 2 and s 3 correspond to variant 1 of our ibm with respectively low medium and high competition strength d 1 for the d 1 parameter values we were inspired by some spatial models devoted to terrestrial plants law et al 2003 since no earlier works giving real or experimental values for phytoplankton competition parameters exist in the literature see bouderbala et al 2018 the weak intensity d 1 0 002 considered in the first scenario s 1 is very close to the one given in law et al 2003 for scenarios s 2 and s 3 we considered two other increasing strengths of competition see table 2 we point that a weak level of competition corresponds to the situation where nutrients and resources are widely available in the medium while a high level of competition represents the case of resource and nutrients deplete for phytoplankton scenarios from s 4 to s 12 concern variant 2 of our ibm and correspond to the different combinations d 1 m 1 obtained with the above three orders of magnitude for the strength of competition and three different levels for the strength of cooperation since the cooperation process has not been modelled before parameter values for this process cannot be found in the existing literature so for our simulation we based on experimental observations dealing with the cooperative behavior in phytoplankton under a predation stress to quantify the degree of magnitude of cooperation and its width many recent biological works abada and segev 2018 duran nebreda and solé 2015 driscoll and travisano 2017 reported that phytoplankton populations often display the characteristics of a multicellular like community rather than a random collection of individuals they communicate cooperate and execute coordinated behaviors the release of signals from some cells which are perceived by other cells culminates in a variety of coordinated actions such as community defense mechanisms hence in our simulation study we considered that the upper limit of the cooperation zone h 2 is equal to the upper limit of the attraction zone r 1 that is h 2 r 1 this constraint expresses the fact that under a predation stress all phytoplankton cells that are present in the attraction zone of a given phytoplankton cell will cooperate with it since they can sense via their chemosensory abilities the signals released by this cell we also considered that cells compete principally within aggregations so it is obvious to take the upper limit of the competition zone smaller than the upper limit of the cooperation zone that is h 1 h 2 indeed competitors for a given cell are only cells that are in its close vicinity while the co operators are the closest cells and also all cells that can communicate with it and sense its warning signals namely the cells that are present in its attraction zone further it was shown that in presence of predators cells can communicate warning signals to a large part of the population triggering community wide defense mechanisms abada and segev 2018 duran nebreda and solé 2015 thus in all our simulations we considered a large value for the upper limit of the cooperation zone h 2 which is equal to the upper limit of the range of attraction r 1 for the cooperation strength m 1 we considered three different orders of magnitude low medium and high that correspond to different degrees of predation stress indeed it has been documented in kapsetaki et al 2016 that different degrees of stress can be observed for different species of predators or phytoplankton also the intensity of the predation stress can vary according to the presence of live predator or only its products filtrates in the absence of the predator himself sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2017 the experimental studies in sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 showed that products of predators stimulate group formation but less than the real presence of predators notice that the 12 scenarios are tested under a large range of attraction r 1 90 μm and a medium diffusion d m 0 0584 μm2 s 1 this set of motion parameters permits the formation of aggregates even if the demographical process is not taken into account see bouderbala et al 2018 that is aggregates can form via only the attraction mechanism between cells due to their chemosensory capacities the widths σ ui i 1 2 in table 1 are respectively related to the h i by the relation h i 3σ ui i 1 2 with the h i representing the limits beyond which the kernels will be null we run 10 simulations for each scenario the spatial statistics r η and n for each scenario are averages of the 10 repetitions the death and division mean rates of a population in a simulation are calculated as follows m t save 1 n t save i 1 n t save m x t save i and d t save 1 n t save i 1 n t save d x t save i the division and death mean rates presented in the simulation results represent the averages of 10 repetitions of the above death and division mean rates 5 simulation results and statistical analysis in this part we present the results obtained from the simulation of the 12 scenarios 5 1 effect of the strength of competition variant 1 for the three scenarios s 1 s 2 and s 3 of variant 1 the clark evans index and the potential group belonging percentage confirm the formation of aggregations however the quality and the intensity of the aggregation process vary according to the different magnitudes of the competition strength we clearly observe that the best aggregation holds for a low competition strength whereas the aggregation becomes weak when the strength of competition is high fig 3 a and b for a low competition strength s 1 the average aggregations size at the end of the simulation is higher than 225 cells per aggregation while it is about 69 cells per aggregation for a medium competition strength s 2 and about 17 cells per aggregation for a high competition strength s 3 see fig 5 a c an increase of the strength of competition means a decrease of the division mean rate which slows up the cell reproduction process while death occurs at a constant rate m 0 0 2 this affects negatively sizes of aggregations compare between s 1 s 2 and s 3 in fig 5a c the potential percentage of cells in groups fig 3a and also the population size fig 6 a also the decay rate of the division mean rate differs between the three scenarios see s 1 s 2 and s 3 in fig 4 a c higher is the strength of competition rapid and stronger is the decrease of the division mean rate fig 4a c we also observe that under a high competition s 3 fig 4c the division mean rate decreases below the death mean rate it attains the value 0 119 which induces a decline in the local density and thus a reduction of the competition effect hence the division mean rate changes its variation direction and starts to increase showing some fluctuations see s 3 in fig 4c due do the changes in the competition effect under the variation of the division mean rate the latter attains the value 0 191 at the end of the simulation notice that a stability is observed in the population dynamic for the scenario of weak competition s 1 when the division mean rate stabilizes around 0 2 d 1 which is the value of the death mean rate fig 4a whereas an almost equilibrium with small fluctuations appears when the competition strength increases fig 4b 5 2 the simultaneous effect of the strengths of competition and cooperation variant 2 5 2 1 on the spatial distribution spatial distributions in fig 2 show aggregations formation in all scenarios from s 4 to s 12 but we observe that the aggregation process is better under a low competition level s 4 s 5 and s 6 and the best aggregation is obtained under a low competition with medium to high cooperation s 5 and s 6 while the worst one is obtained under the scenarios of high competition with low to medium cooperation s 10 and s 11 spatial statistics in figs 3c h confirm these observations we also observe that the competition strength has a negative impact on aggregations see s 10 s 11 and s 12 in fig 2 whereas the strength of cooperation has a positive impact on the spatial distribution fig 2 the sizes of the formed groups fig 5a c and the potential percentage of cells that are in aggregations fig 3c e the positive impact of cooperation on the aggregating pattern is more visible when competition is high see fig 3h fig 2 illustrates well this observation through the differences in the spatial patterns obtained from the respective scenarios the scenario of high competition with no cooperation s 3 the scenario of high competition with low cooperation s 10 and the scenario of high competition with high cooperation s 12 5 2 2 on the division and death mean rates dynamics fig 4d l summarizes the simultaneous dynamics of the death and division mean rates for the nine scenarios s 4 to s 12 from scenarios s 4 s 7 and s 10 fig 4d g and j respectively we can see that a low cooperation has a negligible effect on the death mean rate regardless the competition level the death mean rate remains almost constant during the simulation period while a high cooperation reduces significantly the death mean rate see s 6 s 9 and s 12 indeed for a high cooperation we can observe that the death mean rate reaches its minimum 0 020 under a low and medium competition s 6 fig 4f and s 9 fig 4j and attains the value 0 022 under a high competition s 12 fig 4l which means that death by predation is inhibited in these scenarios from scenarios s 5 s 8 and s 11 we notice that a medium cooperation strength is very sensible to the competition level fig 4e shows that a medium cooperation has a remarkable effect on the death mean rate when competition is weak the death mean rate decreases in s 5 from the value 0 2 to 0 02 see fig 4e that is a medium cooperation can stop the predation loss when competition is weak however the effect of a medium cooperation in reducing the predation death rate weakens when competition increases the minimum value attained by the death mean rate is 0 124 under a medium competition s 8 fig 4h and 0 177 under a high competition s 11 on another hand fig 4 shows that under a low or medium competition the division mean rate decreases until to reach a steady state at which the values of the division and the death mean rates become superimposed see scenarios s 4 to s 6 however there are differences between the different scenarios regarding the equilibrium value reached by the death mean rate which is also the equilibrium value for the division mean rate and the time to reach this equilibrium indeed under a low competition level when cooperation is low the death mean rate is almost constant 0 177 while the division mean rate decreases slowly under the weak effect of competition till to reach the equilibrium value see s 4 in fig 4d more the cooperation is high the death mean rate decreases more rapidly to achieve an equilibrium value that is its minimum 0 02 this decline in the death mean rate increases the local density which amplifies the competition effect and as a result the division mean rate decreases rapidly to reach a steady state at the equilibrium value of the death mean rate in fig 4 we notice that for s 6 rapidly is reached a steady state under which the death and division mean rates have the minimum value 0 02 while in s 5 the death mean rate declines less rapidly and attains its equilibrium later than in s 6 as a consequence the division mean rate takes more time in s 5 to achieve the equilibrium death mean rate value 0 02 and we can see that at the end of the simulation the steady state in s 5 is not completely reached since the division mean rate is a little greater than 0 02 it is equal to 0 023 for the case of medium competition since a weak cooperation has a negligible effect on the death mean rate the time variation of the death and division mean rates in s 7 fig 4g is almost identical to the one obtained in s 2 fig 4b with almost the same equilibrium value in the two scenarios when the cooperation strength increases the death mean rate decreases more to reach a steady state notice that the death mean rate equilibrium value for a high cooperation s 9 is smaller than in the case of medium cooperation s 8 furthermore since in this case the competition strength is greater than in the case of a low competition the division mean rate decreases more rapidly to reach its equilibrium value 0 12 in s 8 and 0 031 in s 9 in the case of high competition the time variation of the death and division mean rates in the scenario of low cooperation s 10 resembles to the one in scenario s 3 at the end of the simulation the mean death rate value is 0 198 while the division mean rate attains 0 167 when the cooperation is medium s 11 the death mean rate decreases but less than under low or medium competitions the small reduction of predation loss due to the medium cooperation has the effect of increasing more the high competition and as a result the division mean rate in s 11 declines strongly and rapidly below the death rate and attains 0 107 this induces a significant decrease in the local density which weakens the competition process for a certain time it results an increase of the division mean rate in s 11 till to approach the mean death rate at the end of the simulation time the death mean rate is 0 183 while the division mean rate attains 0 168 in the scenario of high cooperation s 12 because of the high effect of cooperation the death mean rate decreases strongly and the equilibrium death mean rate is much smaller than in s 11 in fact a high cooperation strength decreases significantly the death mean rate see in s 12 fig 4 that from the 5th day the death mean rate decreases to stabilize around the value 0 025 therefore in addition to the high effect of competition the significant decrease of the death mean rate under the high effect of cooperation induces a significant raise in the local density which amplifies again the high effect of competition as a result the division mean rate declines strongly till to reach rapidly the equilibrium death mean rate 5 2 3 on the aggregation average sizes fig 5a c gives the average groups sizes obtained at the end of the 20th day under the simultaneous variation of the strengths of competition and cooperation they clearly show the negative impact of the competition strength on the aggregation average size we also observe the effect of cooperation in increasing the groups sizes under each competition level especially when the strength of cooperation is high s 6 s 9 and s 12 in fig 5a c we notice that when competition is weak the average group s size in the scenario of a medium cooperation s 5 is a little greater than in the scenario of a high cooperation s 6 this is due to the fact that at the end of the 20th day the division mean rate in s 5 has not completely reached the death mean rate equilibrium value 0 02 while in s 6 the division mean rate equilibrium value 0 02 was attained earlier before the end of the simulation hence the loss of cells in an aggregation is little more in s 6 than in s 5 we also remark that under a high competition the average group s size is almost identical in the scenarios of weak cooperation s 10 and medium cooperation s 11 this can be justified by the fact that at the end of the simulation the death and division mean rates as well as the population dynamic observed in s 11 are close to the ones in s 10 5 2 4 on the population dynamic fig 6b d shows the population dynamic in all scenarios from s 4 to s 12 the population size decreases with the increase of the competition strength see fig 6a however under each level of competition we observe an increase of the population size with the increase of the cooperation strength the population sizes are higher under a low competition level s 4 s 5 and s 6 fig 6b and the highest size is obtained under the scenario of weak competition with high cooperation s 6 see fig 6b for the scenarios s 4 to s 9 stability in the population dynamic takes place once the division mean rate reaches the death mean rate and stabilizes at this value the different population sizes observed at equilibrium are consistent with the simultaneous dynamics of the division and the death mean rates presented in the precedent subsubsection 6 discussion and concluding remarks the aim of this work was to understand how motile phytoplankton cells form groups under predation stress and how resource competition and the anti predation cooperation impact on the aggregating process the group size and the phytoplankton population for this purpose we developed an ibm that take into account small scale biological processes for the phytoplankton cells that are cells motion and cells division and death the cells motion includes two components a molecular diffusion and a drift considered density dependent to take into account the attraction mechanism between cells due to their chemosensory abilities cells division was also considered density dependent to include a competition behavior between cells that slows up their division rate while the death rate was density dependent to integrate the anti predator cooperation between cells that reduces the predation death rate competition on the resources and predation are the most important selective pressures for phytoplankton and many scientists try to perform some experiments to understand how those two selective forces will generate adaptive trade off of the cells inside the groups see for instance boraas et al 1998 it was shown in general that these processes have important impact on the morphology of the multicellular organisms van gestel and tarnita 2017 such as the phytoplankton groups however no model was made to understand how the relationship between competition and predation will act on the formation of the groups and how the groups sizes will change accordingly our ibm addressed this question we called variant 1 of the ibm the cases for which the cooperation strength is null which means that cooperation is not taken into account and variant 2 the version that takes into account the cooperation we point that variant 1 is not biologically meaningful since we work under the hypothesis of presence of predators which implies existence of a cooperative behavior smayda 1997 lurling and beekman 2006 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 so variant 1 is just used as a reference version to which we can quantify the effects of cooperation for the different levels of competition it is important to mention that the construction of the ibm was based on the biological description of the phytoplankton behavior under predation stress and the simulation of the ibm was constrained by experimental observations and real parameter values the simulation of our ibm shows that predator induced groups in the motile phytoplankton cells form from two mechanisms coming together driven by the cells motion in which the attraction mechanism due to chemosensory abilities in these cells is enhanced when predators are present and remaining together explained by the birth death process including both competition and cooperation to be more precise our ibm suggests that in motile phytoplankton cells groups form under predation stress as follows a stress predation stimulates phytoplankton cells to cooperate in order to protect themselves generally predators can engulf single cells but not large cell aggregates as a result the cells cooperative behavior triggers and in the model this is reflected through considering on one hand a large attraction zone which will be included in the cooperation zone in which independent unicellular cells interact communicate and then aggregate and on another hand by including the cooperation term in the death rate expressing that all cells present in the cooperation zone contribute by their aggregation in the reduction of the predation death inside aggregations cells divide at a rate depending on the resource competition which increases or reduces the aggregations sizes and the attractive force prevents the daughter cells to leave the group after division the strength of competition is linked to the availability of resources and the efficiency of the cooperation in reducing the predation loss is governed by the cooperation strength as a response to the intensity of predation stress our ibm was simulated for all combinations that cross different levels of competitions with those of cooperation all the simulations have shown that phytoplankton cells aggregate under predation stress but the quality of the aggregation the sizes of aggregates and the phytoplankton population size differ according to the levels of both competition and cooperation simulations have shown that a high cooperation between cells leads rapidly to an aggregation process that can completely prevent cells being grazed regardless the level of resource competition a medium cooperation prevents predation less quickly and only if competition is weak but when competition increases the aggregation process is not so successful and loss by predation is just reduced but not completely inhibited a weak cooperation has a negligible effect in reducing predation loss regardless the level of competition globally our study showed that although resource competition impacts negatively the aggregating pattern the sizes of groups and the population size cooperation between cells plays an important role in maintaining the aggregation process and keeping the groups and population sizes at a correct level especially when the cooperation strength is high this study also helps the understanding of the complex small scale relationship that exists between competition and cooperation indeed since both of the competition and the cooperation processes are density dependent they interact through the local density as follows cooperation by reducing the predation death rate amplifies the competition process a decrease in the death rate induces an increase in the local density involved in the competition process on the other hand competition by slowing down the division rate reduces the local density of phytoplankton cells involved in the cooperation process which weakens the cooperation effect when the latter is low or medium in this case the attraction induced aggregation will not be efficient to sharply reduce the predation rate but when cooperation is strong it reduces significantly the death rate till to inhibit grazing which leads to significant increased groups that will not be much affected by the division rate decrease due to the high competition the loss of cells due to a high competition is very negligible compared to the predation loss by this the present simulation study explains rigorously how the cooperation process can lead to a good aggregation under a high competition from the biological point of view we think that our model can provide a response to the ecological question on how multicellular groups in motile species of phytoplankton form under predation stress by suggesting the two combined operators coming and remaining together the first is explained through the diffusion and the attraction mechanisms by which independent cells can aggregate and the second is through the birth death process and the attraction force by which the cells divide inside the group with daughter cells remaining in the group after division the sizes of groups and the phytoplankton population vary according to the trade off between the benefits reduction predation risks and the costs slowing down the reproduction process of being in aggregations some experimental works on the group formation under predation stress in motile and non motile phytoplankton species support our finding lurling and beekman 2006 harris 2009 sathe and durand 2016 kapsetaki et al 2016 2017 for instance it was demonstrated that the algae chlamydomonas which are motile species of phytoplankton can form groups by both remaining together after division and aggregating lurling and beekman 2006 harris 2009 sathe and durand 2016 recently kapsetaki et al 2016 and kapsetaki et al 2017 showed that freshwater algae form multicellular groups in response to the presence of predators by both staying together and coming together also many of our simulation results are in agreement with some experimental results obtained on phytoplankton group s formation under predation stress for instance in zhu et al 2016 the authors studied predation induced groups of some alga under deficient resource they showed that along the reduction of phosphorous concentration or light intensity predator induced groups formation of s obliquus showed a decreasing trend and the defensive colony formation was impaired under insufficient resources this result validates our finding on the negative effect of a high competition on the cooperation process and its impact on the aggregation process also authors in kapsetaki et al 2016 and kapsetaki et al 2017 have investigated experimental studies on how algal species form groups in response to the presence of a predator they examined the group formation caused first by the live predator and then by just the predator products these can be products released from the predators or even intracellular products released from dead predator cells the authors found that the presence of live predators or predator products led to increased group formation see fig 3 in kapsetaki et al 2016 but the proportion of cells in groups is greater in the presence of live predator than in the presence of only predator products see fig 3 in kapsetaki et al 2017 these experimental results confirm our simulation results on the aggregates formation under predation stress whatever the level of cooperation and on the positive effect of cooperation on the aggregation process namely that more the predation stress is strong which corresponds to a strong cooperation more the aggregation process is better in kapsetaki et al 2016 the authors also found that for some types of algae the population density decreases under predation stress while not for other species this experimental result is in consensus with our simulation result stating that efficiency of the predator induced aggregation in preventing grazing relies on the intensity of the predation stress represented by the cooperation strength in our modelling which varies with phytoplankton species and or predators species on another hand this study showed that resource competition is a very important process that helps the multicellular groups to not expand into infinite we showed that resource competition plays an important role in regularizing the groups sizes and when the latter become too high in case where the anti predator aggregation is so successful that grazing is inhibited competition can reduce the group size since it acts on the reduction of the growth which favorites the mortality the experimental work of sathe and durand 2016 support this result since these authors observed in their experimental study that once groups formed and cells in groups were protected some cells within a group died the authors even expressed their surprise about this death within aggregates and did not understand the reason of such a death since cells in groups are protected from predators our study explains that the reason of this death is a high resource competition and based on our modelling we can deduce that the closest cells to the center will divide less since they have high local density compared to the others and so their chance of dying via the programmed cell death is higher compared to the farthest cells to the center ratcliff et al 2013 showed that the majority of the apoptotic cells are found close to the center of the group a similar result about the relation between multicellular group size with the mortality was also presented in duran nebreda and solé 2015 from the modelling point of view we stress on the fact that the idea of quantifying the cooperation behavior in phytoplankton is new in both mathematical and biological literatures for phytoplankton and modelling cooperation at the individual level was not made in any previous works competition was used in previous works but in almost all cases at the macroscopic level we mentioned in the introduction the basic competition models of phytoplankton very few works on resource competition in phytoplankton were made at the individual level hellweger and bucci 2009 present a review of such existing ibms and hellweger and kianirad 2007 evaluate three different ibms modeling the growth or division process on an individual basis but to our knowledge no work integrated the spatial structure to study the agent agent interaction in the competition process such a way of modelling competition at the phytoplankton individual level appeared in bouderbala et al 2018 in conclusion this whole study was carried under the hypothesis of the presence of predation stress in the medium our ibm modelling approach provides a response to the question of group formation in the motile phytoplankton cells in presence of both predation stress and resource competition it also helps the understanding of how the motile phytoplankton cells deal with the increase in the competitive and grazing pressures through the formation of groups we point that the model can also be used under the hypothesis that no predator is present with the following changes the upper limit of the attraction zone must be smaller than under a predation stress see bouderbala et al 2018 and both of the cooperation strength and the predation death rate must be null m 1 0 and m p 0 since no predation stress exists we think also that our modelling approach can be extended to a more general context to show that the trade off between the availability of resources and defence from predators can be an important mechanism leading to swarming behavior of for instance fish krill see e g brierley and cox 2010 for krill swarms or insects acknowledgements we would like to thank the editor and the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments which

25157,the world food price crisis in 2007 08 has aroused worldwide attention to the global food price volatility and food self sufficiency issues this paper modelled the entire environment of food production and transaction from a holistic view by a food energy water few nexus in order to reveal the hidden connections related to the food self sufficiency issue including the interdependencies of food production with its restraining factors hybrid energy hybrid water other production sectors and international exchanges this paper mapped all direct and indirect flows in the few nexus and projected a potential emission trading scheme ets to figure out the impacts of policies on few nexus flows nexus robustness total input of all sectors and household expenditures in japan and china the results show that the pattern of food related extraction flows was more imbalanced than the pattern of hybrid energy flows due to the high dependence of japan on the food supply of china 16 11 of total food related extractions an ets may increase japan s total household expenditure on imported goods from china in the fields of sugar refining 1 3096 processing vegetable oils and fats 0 1164 processing of meat cattle 0 1010 as well as slightly decrease the system robustness of the total nexus keywords food energy water nexus japan china trade network analysis emission trading scheme 1 introduction the world suffered a substantial rise of food prices in late 2007 and 2008 especially regarding prices of staple foods such as rice wheat and maize which were each about 40 percent higher on average across countries fao 2011 as an emergency response to this food crisis china customs tariff commission decided to levy 5 to 25 tentative export tariffs on 57 products including wheat corn rice soybeans and other raw grains and milling products in 2008 people s daily 2008 since then the food crisis has aroused more attention regarding the food self sufficiency issue a good food self sufficiency rate is thus essential to prevent food shortages under volatile global food prices although the direct causes of the food crisis were specific and complicated e g booming demands from merging asian countries and for global biomass fuels and shrinking supplies from the us caused by nature hazards as well as the intensification of food export tariffs as this paper argued it is equally essential for food policy makers to have a better understanding of the general factors restraining food production the food interdependencies among countries and the indirect impacts of other policies on food prices fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations classifies countries with respect to levels of food self sufficiency and food security clapp 2015 according to their report concerning the 2005 09 period japan is one of the food net importer countries with a self sufficiency rate less than 80 but with adequate nutrition intake while china still exports food with a self sufficiency rate of 95 but experiencing a mild 5 14 9 level of hunger japan and china are closely related geographically and economically analyzing the food related exchanges of those countries may contribute to understanding the impacts of international interdependencies on food price risks as well as the unsustainable parts of the developing patterns in food net importer and exporter countries there are some studies explored the factors influencing food self sufficiency rate in a specific period of time yang and tyers 1989 and predicted changes in the future under different given conditions by production functions ito and ni 2013 however a more holistic view is required in order to demonstrate the food self sufficiency issue the domestic food production of one country is not only driven restrained by cultivating land capacity domestic demands and nature hazards but also highly interlinked to other fundamental production factors international demands and policy implications so far the food self sufficiency issue has not been thoroughly examined from the systematic perspective a food energy water few nexus can provide such modelling of the entire environment of food production and transaction siddiqi anadon 1994 bazilian et al 2011 biggs et al 2015 food related extractions are mostly generated from the agriculture sector which involves a large amount of water consumption and withdraw moreover the collection purification and distribution of water require huge energy consumption such interactions form the few nexus in a narrow sense in 2011 the world economic forum addressed the energy water food ewf nexus in its water security report wef 2011a indicating that the problem of energy water food is severe and highly interlinked and thus must be addressed concomitantly in 2015 the us national science foundation called for the promotion of research on the interactions of few with a us 50 million fund romero lankao et al 2017 such nexus studies revealing the interdependencies between society and the natural systems would contribute to policy research interests and international research calls the concept of few nexus has been broadened to a powerful metaphor used to convey the interdependencies between society and the natural systems as well as to address specific issues from a holistic view white et al 2018 examined the connections within the sub regional wef nexus of japan korea and china in order to review environmental impacts in national economic growth strategies they demonstrated the mismatch concerning regional wef availability and emphasized that regional specialization is not necessarily mutually beneficial considering environmental linkages bazilian et al 2011 mentioned the cases in south africa and stated that the agricultural sector could be the most affected by energy price increases due to the energy demand of irrigation more few nexus studies contributed to the formation of networks and how elements are linked and hitched to each other zimmerman et al 2018 ramaswami et al 2017 leung pah hang et al 2016 however few researches utilized few nexus to analyze hidden connections of countries related to food self sufficiency issues considering the impacts of exogenous policies this paper fits in this research gap by introducing one climate policy instrument the national emission trading scheme ets in china to investigate its impacts on few nexus of japan and china and also how household expenditure of food products in japan may change due to the ets in such context this paper demonstrated the domestic food production food interdependencies among countries and the indirect impacts of other policies on food prices from a perspective of system analysis in order to do so it modeled an entire environment for the food self sufficiency issue based on the few nexus based on this model this paper mapped all the direct and indirect hybrid food energy water flows in the few nexus as means to reveal the interdependencies of food production with its supporting restraining factors hybrid energy hybrid water other production sectors and international exchanges a projected national emission trading scheme in china a potential application in the target year was introduced as a policy instrument on the few nexus to further investigate the impacts of climate policy on the total inputs and household expenditure of domestic international foods indicators were adopted to describe the network s availability resilience and dominance which this paper considered as the most important features of japan china few nexus how these features changes after new policy instruments e g ets was also included 2 methodology this paper modelled the interdependencies between society and the natural systems through the exchanges of food energy water as shown in fig 1 typical environmental economics studies lenzen 1998 stokes et al 1994 are generally based on the one direction connections from left to right in terms of the few nexus modelling factors from nature form the structure of energy water supply and then the hybrid energy water flows support goods and service transactions during the production process to meet the demands from residences within an economy and finally the economic activities affect the environment the few nexus considers the interdependencies such as the water materials after waste treatment flowing back to nature factor inputs the labor input provided by final users to produce goods and services and the policy instruments employed by authorities to shift the input structure of energy and water here specifically the few nexus of japan and china is modeled to contribute to a better understanding of i the impacts of policy instruments the ones strongly related to ecological system capacity restrains and economic activities on the total inputs and the domestic foreign household expenditures ii the essential issues such as the availability resilience and the international trade relationship for countries that have a stable access to food imports but depend heavily on international food supplies an io based model input output based model is adopted in order to quantify all hybrid food energy water few flows and simulate the impacts of policies of one country on another in this paper io analysis has a long history leontief 1936 and has been broadly utilized in studies of economic structure of macroeconomics and global value chain social labor input and household expenditures saving environmental environmental impact of economic social activities ecological network analysis of corresponding flows biological biological diversity footprints fields among others although it is difficult to clearly state any robust or significant causality within io theory or reflect all accurate transaction costs of related flows it is a powerful tool to map all direct and indirect flows among regions and sectors it can also show the supply and use balance of goods services factors resources from an up down approach which is especially resourceful when providing references to policy makers therefore an io based model may properly serve the research objective of this paper which is to observe the transaction flows of food energy water between japan and china investigate the availability and resilience of this few nexus and provide references of impacts from new policy instruments for policy makers 2 1 data the original io table is extracted from the exiobase version 2 2 2 which is a part of the creea project compiling and refining environmental and economic accounts funded by eu the database includes the compilation of a global multiregional environmentally extended supply and use table tisserant et al 2018 for each country this table covers 163 sectors details see appendix i it also provides corresponding accounts of material use resource consumption and emission release intensities for those 163 sectors among which total energy carrier use 2 sub accounts tj m eur water withdraws 86 sub accounts mm3 m eur and food related extractions 30 sub accounts kt m eur are related to this paper the current version of exiobase was developed by harmonizing and detailing suts for 43 countries and regions in 2007 for china the available raw data was from the input output table in producers prices for 2007 in national currency gtap for japan the available raw data was from input output table for 2005 in national currencies in the following valuations total producers prices imported products trade margins 2 types transport margins 7 types and purchasers prices wood et al 2013a the table this paper adopted reflects an extremely detailed global intermediate and final input flows at that time especially from a perspective of system macroeconomics research at a cross country level but simultaneously the lack of access to the latest data becomes one of the limitations of this paper 2 2 hybrid flows generated by bilateral trade in few nexus in a bilateral io model the economic system with all n sectors in two countries has 1 x 1 n ax 1 n y 1 n 2 x 1 n i a 1 y 1 n i a a 2 a 3 a 4 y where the total output x of the two countries satisfies their total intermediate demand a x and total final demand y and a represents the input coefficient matrix energy water food related extraction intensities in terms of economic activities represent the amount of energy water food related extraction used to produce one unit of output in one sector an intensity vector in terms of physical unit of output can be relatively more accurate in reflecting the technology level of production within a region however a system of two countries internalizes their bilateral intermediate and final input which involves a large share of trade in services or other forms of exchanges excluding goods therefore the intensity vector in terms of total monetary output u e n e i m u w a t i m and u f r e i m should be adopted to describe the energy water food related extraction flows induced by final use exchanges in the bilateral system 3 u i f r e

the sum of all intensity vectors of m types food related extractions represent the intensity of total food related extractions u i f r e which consists of domestic extractions used of primary crops 13 types and animals 2 types as well as the corresponding unused domestic extractions the intensity represents the material use input of food related extractions in physical unit to produce one monetary unit of total output in each sector in eq 4 5 the vectors on the left hand side represent the hybrid intensity of energy carrier use u i h e n e and water withdraws u i h w a t the concept of hybrid water or water related energy can be described in various ways depending on how the study builds its perspective economical physical environmental ecological etc of system analysis in which sense the study defined energy or water and what kind of role the energy water nexus was playing in the system to the author s knowledge there is still no widely accepted assessment standard for hybrid energy water as a terminology recently it has been frequently defined as coupling energy water for each economic sector in the network analysis studies wang et al 2017 fang and chen 2017 siddiqi and anadon 2011 although the definition of this paper was slightly different from the studies above considering its applicability to io framework this paper regards the concept of hybrid energy water as an essential channel integrating networks generated by human activities at different scales economical physical environmental ecological etc revealing how sustainable development has been driven and indicating how human well being has been served this paper defined the sum of all m types of intensity vectors as hybrid intensity vectors as they cover the physical amount of one factor use energy use or water withdraw related to the other and such relationship could not be reflected by their net inter sector inputs through economic activities the hybrid intensity of energy carrier use u i h e n e consists of an aggregation of energy uses of 60 primary and secondary energy products coal gasoline see wood et al 2013b namely the sole use of energy factor and heat rejected to freshwater which refers to the thermal pollution from energy production absorbed as energy factor input to support hot water supply namely the water related energy uses the hybrid intensity of water withdraws u i h w a t includes the green 13 types and blue water 13 types for agriculture production blue water withdraws for manufacture industries 52 types namely the sole use of water factor and blue water withdraws for cooling system in electricity supply tower cooling 5 types once through cooling 3 types namely the energy related water withdraws detailed classification of food energy water types in this paper are shown in appendix ii 6 f fre u ˆ fre x u ˆ fre i a 1 y 7 f h ene u ˆ h ene x u ˆ h ene i a 1 y 8 f h wat u ˆ h wat x u ˆ h wat i a 1 y eqs 4 5 show all direct and indirect physical food related extractions f fre hybrid energy uses f h ene and water withdraws f h wat involved in the economic activities to meet the needs of japan s and china s final demand considering that such definition of hybrid energy water and application of io theory are both highly integrated in order to avoid double accounting this paper clarifies i what an io based model can and cannot achieve when it is adopted in order to disclose the network structure of a self organized economic system ii on such premise why it is necessary to define the hybrid energy water conveying the physical amount of one factor use related to the other iii what is the nature of energy and water under io theory framework and what is the economic meaning of one random cell in hybrid flow matrices this paper considered such clarification as its contribution to modelling the food energy water nexus of a bilateral system an io model can reflect the macroeconomic structure within an economy by the balance of total output accounting and total input accounting one of its greatest contribution is known as revealing all inputs induced by final demand during the process of production namely all direct inter sector input a and indirect input transmitted by further pathways a 2 a 3 a 4 as long as the inter sector transactions are related to human economic activities they will be covered by io accounting however there are also several transactions which cannot be reflected in a basic io table such as factor inputs which are hardly described as monetary inputs from any end use sector e g land use energy use emission release or materials occupied within or among sectors rather than materials consumed e g water withdraw energy capacity extended io models are required to quantify these transactions therefore intensity vectors from the extended matrices in io based models should avoid what has already been involved in the io input accounting in this paper the hybrid energy use water withdraws intensity vector including water related energy uses energy related water withdraws should also avoid what has already been covered by any end use sector in the io input accounting collection purification and distribution of water steam and hot water supply eq 4 5 in this paper are based on such consideration under an io theory framework energy usually refers to fossil fuels and all forms of energy carriers that drive the production of goods and services although several sectors in io tables lie in the life cycle of energy supply e g mining of fossil fuels production of electricity energy itself is still independent from all end use sectors providing intermediate inputs and final inputs for energy uses including water related energy hybrid energy intensity u i h e n e when i refers to the production of electricity sector represents all energy used to provide one monetary unit of electricity including the additional thermal waste absorbed as energy input for hot water supply when i refers to the steam and hot water supply sector u i h e n e represents all energy used to provide one monetary unit of hot water including the additional thermal waste absorbed by water during the production process on the other hand sectors representing the water consumption related to economic activities in the io table are the collection purification and distribution of water sector and steam and hot water supply sector the row of these two sectors represents their input to other sectors namely the total water consumption of all sectors in monetary unit however the water withdraws or the real water required to produce one unit of total output of other sectors cannot be reflected by the io model the extended hybrid water withdraw intensity matrix in this paper contains 86 types of water withdraws for each sector the matrix is nearly a diagonal matrix with one element per row except for several rows where the water withdraws for one sector e g aluminum and aluminum products are needed for the production of the sector itself and its re processing and treating e g secondary aluminum for treatment re processing of secondary aluminum into new aluminum 2 3 the introduction of emission trading scheme natural hazards regional conflicts and other policy instruments may intervene in the availability of the few network within a region as well as weaken or strengthen some specific flows of food energy or water this model investigated the influence of a recently applied climate policy instrument the national emission trading scheme ets in china in 2018 the national ets in china may cover the electricity supply sector with a cap emission limit of 4 gt carbon dioxide emissions and an average market price of 30 yuan t the average market price in its eight pilot markets since 2013 of emission allowances there are two main reasons for selecting ets as a typical policy introduction in modeling the few nexus along with the increase in the input of electricity supply production additional cost for power plants to purchase emission allowances the final product price of electricity may increase resulting in a rising intermediate electricity input for all sectors part of such input would be transferred to the final consumers as japan and china share a close economic relationship it is necessary to investigate the impact of national ets in china on the final consumptions in japan especially food consumption another reason lies in the interdependency of electricity and hybrid energy water assuming that the technology level physical input coefficient in this paper would not change in the short run the changes in all direct and indirect energy uses and water withdraws may reveal the impact of climate policy on resources conservation table 1 shows the mechanism of ets s impact on few nexus in a simplified io framework this paper assumes that the total demand of japan and china in physical unit remains the same as well as the physical input coefficient of producers and the consumption preference of consumers the influence mechanism starts at an additional input in electricity supply sector in china due to the national ets μ and ends in an increase in the final consumptions of japan and china in step 1 the original emission abatement cost μ results in an increase in the total input of electricity sector and an increase with the same amount in the total output according to the production balance in step 2 the total increase in the output would fully be distributed to the intermediate output of electricity supply sector in china considering the nature of this industry generally electricity supply sectors operate with competitive markets and cost based pricing in many countries however the energy industry in china has been operating with a highly regulated dispatch and the two part pricing system such regulation resulted in a lack of channels to convey emission abatement costs between consumers and producers within this sector therefore this paper assumes that currently the producers of the electricity supply sector of china would take the full responsibility of the additional emission abatement cost and the only channel left to convey their cost to the final consumers is through the intermediate inputs to other sectors μ i i n 9 μ i i n μ a i j x i a i j x i in step 3 this paper assumes that producers in all sectors except the electricity supply sector would convey a certain share σ i of their additional cost to the end use consumers the rest 1 σ i would be reflected as a negative vector in the value added matrix this paper assumes that producers in all sectors except electricity supply sector would convey a certain share σ i of their additional cost to the end use consumers the rest 1 σ i would be reflected as a negative vector in the value added matrix in the case of electricity supply sectors σ i are all zero the markup ratio of entities was adopted as an indicator of σ i as the percentage that producers wish to convey the additional costs to consumers should be at least larger their original markup ratio in io framework the total operating surplus on total outputs were used to represent markup ratios 10 μ i c σ i μ i i n 11 μ i v μ i i n σ i μ i i n where μ i c represents the consumers share of the additional costs in all sectors due to the rising intermediate inputs from the electricity supply sector μ i v represents the producer s share in step 4 the total increases of final consumption and in total output in all sectors are μ c in step 5 μ i c would be distributed to the final consumers in japan μ i c j and the final consumers in china μ i c c 12 μ i c j μ i c y i j c j y i j c j 13 μ i c c μ i c y i j c c y i j c c 2 4 indicators for availability resilience and dominance of few nexus food energy and water are the fundamental drivers of regional development and convey the interdependencies between natural resources and human wellbeing this paper considers the most essential indicators of few nexus as i availability the amount of food produced to feed the population and serve other production needs within the region ii resilience namely the system robustness against droughts floods and other climate hazards iii dominance or the impact of indirect flows namely to what extent one region relies on another region on few uses the availability resilience and dominance indicators of few nexus are adopted based on the ena ecological network analysis framework the availability of few nexus can be reflected by network utility analysis nua mutual relationships among network compartments can be expressed by the direct utility matrix d and integral utility matrix u lu et al 2015 based on the results of food energy water flows eqs 6 8 the direct utility between sector i and j d i j is 14 d i j f i j f j i t i where f i j represents the food or hybrid energy or hybrid water from sector i to sector j t i represents the total input or output flows of i th sector 15 u i d d 2 d 3 d 4 i d 1 u shows all direct and indirect utilities of food or hybrid energy or hybrid water network it also reflects the strength of network organization this paper introduced s i g n d and s i g n u as sign matrices in order to simplify mutual relationships quantified by direct utilities and integral utilities mutual interactions between sectors can be interpreted as conditions of mutualism exploitation being exploited competition and neutrality 0 0 fath 2007 network mutualism index m i indicates the ratio of positive and negative utilities while synergism index s i quantifies the total magnitude of them chen and chen 2012 16 m i s i g n d s i g n d 17 s i u i j where s i g n d m a x s i g h u i j 0 s i g n d m i n s i g h u i j 0 system mutualism and synergism occurs when m i 1 or s i 0 resilience of few nexus can be reflected by the system robustness sr by considering the balance between flows efficiency and redundancy ulanowlcz and

represents the total output flows of food energy water network therefore the system robustness indicator s r can be calculated as 20 s r a c l o g a c dominance of indirect effects in few nexus can be reflected by indicator i d which shows to what extent one region or sector relies on another region or sector on few uses indirect effect refers to any effect that requires an intermediary node to mediate the transfer and can be of any length fath et al 2013 in this paper the strength of indirectness has been measured in a ratio of the sum of the indirect flows intensities divided by the direct flow intensities 21 f in u ˆ ax 22 g i j f i j i n f j 23 n i g 1 24 i d i j 1 n n i j g i j δ i j i j 1 n n i j where δ i j the kronecker delta 1 if and only if i j and is 0 otherwise the dominance

household expenditures due to the application of ets in china indicators showing the availability resilience dominance and monetary flow changes of the few nexus after ets are also listed 3 1 hybrid flows in the few nexus of japan and china in the target year the total export of japan to china in monetary unit overweighed the total export form china to japan the main trade flows from japan to china were dominated by manufacture sectors and sectors in the service industry however the following mapping results show that the hybrid energy flows of two countries were nearly symmetric moreover the hybrid water and food related extraction flows from china to japan were inversely larger than the flows from japan to china such differences were related to the differences in the interdependency structures of two countries as shown in figs 2 4 compared with the pattern of bilateral monetary input flows the pattern of hybrid energy flows was similar to the export structure of two countries nearly symmetrical dominated by manufacture sectors and sectors in the service industry however the share of china s total input flows to japan are less than the share of china s energy flows to japan indicating that sectors generating flows from china to japan are more energy intensive the results of hidden hybrid energy flows show that if china keeps its export oriented economic growth strategy its development will not be sustainable it may soon be restrained by the scarcity of domestic energy supply and environmental pressures compared with the pattern of monetary input flows and hybrid energy flows the pattern of hybrid water flows was more imbalanced with a 93 96 of bilateral hybrid water transactions induced by the total demands of japan according to this paper such imbalance resulted from high water withdraw intensities in china and large bilateral imports of agriculture related sectors in japan the top three flows japan imported from china were all from cultivating sectors with an average hybrid water withdraw intensity of 4 30 m m3 m eur which is more water intensive when compared to the production of food processing an average of 0 04 m m3 m eur and manufacturing an average of 0 01 m m3 m eur besides rice cereal grains and oil seeds all other cultivating sectors contributed to 1 45 b m3 21 06 of the bilateral hybrid water flows according to liu et al 2015 if considering all direct and indirect consumption of water four river basins in china suffered from a moderate to severe annual water scarcity in 2010 the haihe huaihe liaohe and huanghe basins in china the competing demands of water for national production and international trade have existed and may still exist in the next two decades it is also essential to prove the value added of cultivating products expanding the exports in water intensive sectors may worsen the water shortages in china the pattern of food related extraction flows was even more imbalanced when compared to the pattern of hybrid water flows 98 96 of bilateral hybrid water transactions were induced by the total demands of japan japan has been highly dependent on the food supply of china nearly 16 11 of the direct food related extractions according to the results of this paper among which cereal grains 22 60 vegetables fruit nuts 20 80 paddy rice 16 66 sugar cane and sugar beet 10 50 and wheat 8 14 contributed most to the bilateral food supply in the target year japan s food self sufficiency ratio was 79 in 1960 but it fell rapidly in the last 45 years to the lowest among countries with more than 100 million in population kako 2010 although japan has held stable accesses to imported foods nature hazards trade policy negotiations and food security regulation changes in food supply countries such as china may still cause direct economic losses and increase food price volatility in japan it is still essential for japan to keep its food self sufficiency in order to get less exposed to such risks 3 2 impacts of the projected ets this paper assumed that the emission mitigation goal would be 5 of the original level with 90 initial allowances allocated for free and an average market price of 30 yuan t therefore the total additional abatement cost due to ets would be 40 10 m eur table 2 shows the impacts of this assumed ets scenario the increase rate of total input in the electricity supply sector in china would be 0 0142 the average increase rate of total input in all other sectors in china would be around 0 0060 the market price this paper adopted 30 yuan t could be further increased to the official guidance price 200 yuan t the sectors where total input increased most due to the application of ets ranged from water supply 0 059 to cultivation processing manufacture of food e g raw milk processing of meat cattle processing of meat pigs sugar refining and manufacture of tobacco products different from ets an environmental tax may increase the additional abatement costs in all sectors proportionally therefore the sectors with a smaller total input may be influenced more by the ets it is essential to set an effective limitation for the coverage of ets unless the entity has an annual revenue average of past three five years above such limitation it should not be covered by ets the projected ets may increase the total household expenditure of japan imported from china in sugar refining 1 3096 processing vegetable oils and fats 0 1164 and processing of meat cattle 0 1010 these sectors in japan were facing the highest food price volatility risk in other words ets may weaken the price competitiveness of china s exports in these sectors 3 3 availability resilience and dominance indicators of few nexus the indicators of the total monetary flows in table 3 can be viewed as the baseline when analyzing the few nexus in all three networks network mutualism indicators were less than one while the network synergism indicators were larger than zero the synergism in the network of food related extractions was less than the synergism of the total monetary flows as cultivation processing and manufacture of food were less dependent to other sectors when compared to hybrid energy and hybrid water the dominance of indirect effects was smaller than the baseline in all three networks while the system robustness was larger especially the hybrid water network and food network like the network formed by total monetary flows between japan and china sectors in the energy system tend to be connected by more intricate and dense flows resulting in a higher redundancy all indicators remained nearly the same in the ets scenario network mutualism system robustness and the dominance of indirect effects decreased slightly while the network synergism increased slightly based on the assumption of constant exchange amount in physical units the introduction of ets would strengthen the density of hybrid energy flows in monetary units as an ets would directly influence the electricity supply sector which is most related to energy supply along with the stronger interdependence in hybrid energy nexus in the bilateral system the introduction of ets would result in a stronger synergism and a higher redundancy in all economic activities including food related sectors in both countries and reducing the system robustness of the bilateral nexus 4 conclusion this paper mapped the hybrid flows in the few nexus of japan and china in 2007 by an io based model in order to figure out the interdependencies of hybrid energy hybrid water and food extractions with other production sectors in two countries the pattern of hybrid energy flows was nearly symmetrical dominated by manufacture sectors and the service industry the pattern of hybrid water and food related extraction flows were more imbalanced due to the high dependence of japan on the food supply of china 16 11 for china the policy of maintaining 95 self sufficiency in grain production signifies the strategic importance of its agriculture sector white et al 2017 considering the competing demands of water for national production and international trade it is essential to improve the value added of cultivating products and to mitigate the expansion in the exports of water intensive products for japan keeping and increasing its food self sufficiency by expanding the food supplier countries may help japan get less exposed to the global food price volatility especially external shocks in its main food supplier china the sectors where total input increased most due to the projected application of a national emission trading scheme in china ranged from electricity water supply to cultivation processing manufacture of foods e g raw milk processing of meat cattle processing of meat pigs sugar refining and manufacture of tobacco products according to this paper the projected ets may increase japan s total household expenditure on imported goods from china in the fields of sugar refining 1 3096 processing vegetable oils and fats 0 1164 and processing of meat cattle 0 1010 for japan these sectors were facing the highest food price volatility risk for china ets may weaken the price competitiveness of exports in these sectors network synergism occurs in hybrid energy hybrid water and food related extraction

food network all indicators remained nearly the same in the ets scenario network mutualism system robustness and the dominance of indirect effects decreased slightly while the network synergism

25157,the world food price crisis in 2007 08 has aroused worldwide attention to the global food price volatility and food self sufficiency issues this paper modelled the entire environment of food production and transaction from a holistic view by a food energy water few nexus in order to reveal the hidden connections related to the food self sufficiency issue including the interdependencies of food production with its restraining factors hybrid energy hybrid water other production sectors and international exchanges this paper mapped all direct and indirect flows in the few nexus and projected a potential emission trading scheme ets to figure out the impacts of policies on few nexus flows nexus robustness total input of all sectors and household expenditures in japan and china the results show that the pattern of food related extraction flows was more imbalanced than the pattern of hybrid energy flows due to the high dependence of japan on the food supply of china 16 11 of total food related extractions an ets may increase japan s total household expenditure on imported goods from china in the fields of sugar refining 1 3096 processing vegetable oils and fats 0 1164 processing of meat cattle 0 1010 as well as slightly decrease the system robustness of the total nexus keywords food energy water nexus japan china trade network analysis emission trading scheme 1 introduction the world suffered a substantial rise of food prices in late 2007 and 2008 especially regarding prices of staple foods such as rice wheat and maize which were each about 40 percent higher on average across countries fao 2011 as an emergency response to this food crisis china customs tariff commission decided to levy 5 to 25 tentative export tariffs on 57 products including wheat corn rice soybeans and other raw grains and milling products in 2008 people s daily 2008 since then the food crisis has aroused more attention regarding the food self sufficiency issue a good food self sufficiency rate is thus essential to prevent food shortages under volatile global food prices although the direct causes of the food crisis were specific and complicated e g booming demands from merging asian countries and for global biomass fuels and shrinking supplies from the us caused by nature hazards as well as the intensification of food export tariffs as this paper argued it is equally essential for food policy makers to have a better understanding of the general factors restraining food production the food interdependencies among countries and the indirect impacts of other policies on food prices fao food and agriculture organization of the united nations classifies countries with respect to levels of food self sufficiency and food security clapp 2015 according to their report concerning the 2005 09 period japan is one of the food net importer countries with a self sufficiency rate less than 80 but with adequate nutrition intake while china still exports food with a self sufficiency rate of 95 but experiencing a mild 5 14 9 level of hunger japan and china are closely related geographically and economically analyzing the food related exchanges of those countries may contribute to understanding the impacts of international interdependencies on food price risks as well as the unsustainable parts of the developing patterns in food net importer and exporter countries there are some studies explored the factors influencing food self sufficiency rate in a specific period of time yang and tyers 1989 and predicted changes in the future under different given conditions by production functions ito and ni 2013 however a more holistic view is required in order to demonstrate the food self sufficiency issue the domestic food production of one country is not only driven restrained by cultivating land capacity domestic demands and nature hazards but also highly interlinked to other fundamental production factors international demands and policy implications so far the food self sufficiency issue has not been thoroughly examined from the systematic perspective a food energy water few nexus can provide such modelling of the entire environment of food production and transaction siddiqi anadon 1994 bazilian et al 2011 biggs et al 2015 food related extractions are mostly generated from the agriculture sector which involves a large amount of water consumption and withdraw moreover the collection purification and distribution of water require huge energy consumption such interactions form the few nexus in a narrow sense in 2011 the world economic forum addressed the energy water food ewf nexus in its water security report wef 2011a indicating that the problem of energy water food is severe and highly interlinked and thus must be addressed concomitantly in 2015 the us national science foundation called for the promotion of research on the interactions of few with a us 50 million fund romero lankao et al 2017 such nexus studies revealing the interdependencies between society and the natural systems would contribute to policy research interests and international research calls the concept of few nexus has been broadened to a powerful metaphor used to convey the interdependencies between society and the natural systems as well as to address specific issues from a holistic view white et al 2018 examined the connections within the sub regional wef nexus of japan korea and china in order to review environmental impacts in national economic growth strategies they demonstrated the mismatch concerning regional wef availability and emphasized that regional specialization is not necessarily mutually beneficial considering environmental linkages bazilian et al 2011 mentioned the cases in south africa and stated that the agricultural sector could be the most affected by energy price increases due to the energy demand of irrigation more few nexus studies contributed to the formation of networks and how elements are linked and hitched to each other zimmerman et al 2018 ramaswami et al 2017 leung pah hang et al 2016 however few researches utilized few nexus to analyze hidden connections of countries related to food self sufficiency issues considering the impacts of exogenous policies this paper fits in this research gap by introducing one climate policy instrument the national emission trading scheme ets in china to investigate its impacts on few nexus of japan and china and also how household expenditure of food products in japan may change due to the ets in such context this paper demonstrated the domestic food production food interdependencies among countries and the indirect impacts of other policies on food prices from a perspective of system analysis in order to do so it modeled an entire environment for the food self sufficiency issue based on the few nexus based on this model this paper mapped all the direct and indirect hybrid food energy water flows in the few nexus as means to reveal the interdependencies of food production with its supporting restraining factors hybrid energy hybrid water other production sectors and international exchanges a projected national emission trading scheme in china a potential application in the target year was introduced as a policy instrument on the few nexus to further investigate the impacts of climate policy on the total inputs and household expenditure of domestic international foods indicators were adopted to describe the network s availability resilience and dominance which this paper considered as the most important features of japan china few nexus how these features changes after new policy instruments e g ets was also included 2 methodology this paper modelled the interdependencies between society and the natural systems through the exchanges of food energy water as shown in fig 1 typical environmental economics studies lenzen 1998 stokes et al 1994 are generally based on the one direction connections from left to right in terms of the few nexus modelling factors from nature form the structure of energy water supply and then the hybrid energy water flows support goods and service transactions during the production process to meet the demands from residences within an economy and finally the economic activities affect the environment the few nexus considers the interdependencies such as the water materials after waste treatment flowing back to nature factor inputs the labor input provided by final users to produce goods and services and the policy instruments employed by authorities to shift the input structure of energy and water here specifically the few nexus of japan and china is modeled to contribute to a better understanding of i the impacts of policy instruments the ones strongly related to ecological system capacity restrains and economic activities on the total inputs and the domestic foreign household expenditures ii the essential issues such as the availability resilience and the international trade relationship for countries that have a stable access to food imports but depend heavily on international food supplies an io based model input output based model is adopted in order to quantify all hybrid food energy water few flows and simulate the impacts of policies of one country on another in this paper io analysis has a long history leontief 1936 and has been broadly utilized in studies of economic structure of macroeconomics and global value chain social labor input and household expenditures saving environmental environmental impact of economic social activities ecological network analysis of corresponding flows biological biological diversity footprints fields among others although it is difficult to clearly state any robust or significant causality within io theory or reflect all accurate transaction costs of related flows it is a powerful tool to map all direct and indirect flows among regions and sectors it can also show the supply and use balance of goods services factors resources from an up down approach which is especially resourceful when providing references to policy makers therefore an io based model may properly serve the research objective of this paper which is to observe the transaction flows of food energy water between japan and china investigate the availability and resilience of this few nexus and provide references of impacts from new policy instruments for policy makers 2 1 data the original io table is extracted from the exiobase version 2 2 2 which is a part of the creea project compiling and refining environmental and economic accounts funded by eu the database includes the compilation of a global multiregional environmentally extended supply and use table tisserant et al 2018 for each country this table covers 163 sectors details see appendix i it also provides corresponding accounts of material use resource consumption and emission release intensities for those 163 sectors among which total energy carrier use 2 sub accounts tj m eur water withdraws 86 sub accounts mm3 m eur and food related extractions 30 sub accounts kt m eur are related to this paper the current version of exiobase was developed by harmonizing and detailing suts for 43 countries and regions in 2007 for china the available raw data was from the input output table in producers prices for 2007 in national currency gtap for japan the available raw data was from input output table for 2005 in national currencies in the following valuations total producers prices imported products trade margins 2 types transport margins 7 types and purchasers prices wood et al 2013a the table this paper adopted reflects an extremely detailed global intermediate and final input flows at that time especially from a perspective of system macroeconomics research at a cross country level but simultaneously the lack of access to the latest data becomes one of the limitations of this paper 2 2 hybrid flows generated by bilateral trade in few nexus in a bilateral io model the economic system with all n sectors in two countries has 1 x 1 n ax 1 n y 1 n 2 x 1 n i a 1 y 1 n i a a 2 a 3 a 4 y where the total output x of the two countries satisfies their total intermediate demand a x and total final demand y and a represents the input coefficient matrix energy water food related extraction intensities in terms of economic activities represent the amount of energy water food related extraction used to produce one unit of output in one sector an intensity vector in terms of physical unit of output can be relatively more accurate in reflecting the technology level of production within a region however a system of two countries internalizes their bilateral intermediate and final input which involves a large share of trade in services or other forms of exchanges excluding goods therefore the intensity vector in terms of total monetary output u e n e i m u w a t i m and u f r e i m should be adopted to describe the energy water food related extraction flows induced by final use exchanges in the bilateral system 3 u i f r e

the sum of all intensity vectors of m types food related extractions represent the intensity of total food related extractions u i f r e which consists of domestic extractions used of primary crops 13 types and animals 2 types as well as the corresponding unused domestic extractions the intensity represents the material use input of food related extractions in physical unit to produce one monetary unit of total output in each sector in eq 4 5 the vectors on the left hand side represent the hybrid intensity of energy carrier use u i h e n e and water withdraws u i h w a t the concept of hybrid water or water related energy can be described in various ways depending on how the study builds its perspective economical physical environmental ecological etc of system analysis in which sense the study defined energy or water and what kind of role the energy water nexus was playing in the system to the author s knowledge there is still no widely accepted assessment standard for hybrid energy water as a terminology recently it has been frequently defined as coupling energy water for each economic sector in the network analysis studies wang et al 2017 fang and chen 2017 siddiqi and anadon 2011 although the definition of this paper was slightly different from the studies above considering its applicability to io framework this paper regards the concept of hybrid energy water as an essential channel integrating networks generated by human activities at different scales economical physical environmental ecological etc revealing how sustainable development has been driven and indicating how human well being has been served this paper defined the sum of all m types of intensity vectors as hybrid intensity vectors as they cover the physical amount of one factor use energy use or water withdraw related to the other and such relationship could not be reflected by their net inter sector inputs through economic activities the hybrid intensity of energy carrier use u i h e n e consists of an aggregation of energy uses of 60 primary and secondary energy products coal gasoline see wood et al 2013b namely the sole use of energy factor and heat rejected to freshwater which refers to the thermal pollution from energy production absorbed as energy factor input to support hot water supply namely the water related energy uses the hybrid intensity of water withdraws u i h w a t includes the green 13 types and blue water 13 types for agriculture production blue water withdraws for manufacture industries 52 types namely the sole use of water factor and blue water withdraws for cooling system in electricity supply tower cooling 5 types once through cooling 3 types namely the energy related water withdraws detailed classification of food energy water types in this paper are shown in appendix ii 6 f fre u ˆ fre x u ˆ fre i a 1 y 7 f h ene u ˆ h ene x u ˆ h ene i a 1 y 8 f h wat u ˆ h wat x u ˆ h wat i a 1 y eqs 4 5 show all direct and indirect physical food related extractions f fre hybrid energy uses f h ene and water withdraws f h wat involved in the economic activities to meet the needs of japan s and china s final demand considering that such definition of hybrid energy water and application of io theory are both highly integrated in order to avoid double accounting this paper clarifies i what an io based model can and cannot achieve when it is adopted in order to disclose the network structure of a self organized economic system ii on such premise why it is necessary to define the hybrid energy water conveying the physical amount of one factor use related to the other iii what is the nature of energy and water under io theory framework and what is the economic meaning of one random cell in hybrid flow matrices this paper considered such clarification as its contribution to modelling the food energy water nexus of a bilateral system an io model can reflect the macroeconomic structure within an economy by the balance of total output accounting and total input accounting one of its greatest contribution is known as revealing all inputs induced by final demand during the process of production namely all direct inter sector input a and indirect input transmitted by further pathways a 2 a 3 a 4 as long as the inter sector transactions are related to human economic activities they will be covered by io accounting however there are also several transactions which cannot be reflected in a basic io table such as factor inputs which are hardly described as monetary inputs from any end use sector e g land use energy use emission release or materials occupied within or among sectors rather than materials consumed e g water withdraw energy capacity extended io models are required to quantify these transactions therefore intensity vectors from the extended matrices in io based models should avoid what has already been involved in the io input accounting in this paper the hybrid energy use water withdraws intensity vector including water related energy uses energy related water withdraws should also avoid what has already been covered by any end use sector in the io input accounting collection purification and distribution of water steam and hot water supply eq 4 5 in this paper are based on such consideration under an io theory framework energy usually refers to fossil fuels and all forms of energy carriers that drive the production of goods and services although several sectors in io tables lie in the life cycle of energy supply e g mining of fossil fuels production of electricity energy itself is still independent from all end use sectors providing intermediate inputs and final inputs for energy uses including water related energy hybrid energy intensity u i h e n e when i refers to the production of electricity sector represents all energy used to provide one monetary unit of electricity including the additional thermal waste absorbed as energy input for hot water supply when i refers to the steam and hot water supply sector u i h e n e represents all energy used to provide one monetary unit of hot water including the additional thermal waste absorbed by water during the production process on the other hand sectors representing the water consumption related to economic activities in the io table are the collection purification and distribution of water sector and steam and hot water supply sector the row of these two sectors represents their input to other sectors namely the total water consumption of all sectors in monetary unit however the water withdraws or the real water required to produce one unit of total output of other sectors cannot be reflected by the io model the extended hybrid water withdraw intensity matrix in this paper contains 86 types of water withdraws for each sector the matrix is nearly a diagonal matrix with one element per row except for several rows where the water withdraws for one sector e g aluminum and aluminum products are needed for the production of the sector itself and its re processing and treating e g secondary aluminum for treatment re processing of secondary aluminum into new aluminum 2 3 the introduction of emission trading scheme natural hazards regional conflicts and other policy instruments may intervene in the availability of the few network within a region as well as weaken or strengthen some specific flows of food energy or water this model investigated the influence of a recently applied climate policy instrument the national emission trading scheme ets in china in 2018 the national ets in china may cover the electricity supply sector with a cap emission limit of 4 gt carbon dioxide emissions and an average market price of 30 yuan t the average market price in its eight pilot markets since 2013 of emission allowances there are two main reasons for selecting ets as a typical policy introduction in modeling the few nexus along with the increase in the input of electricity supply production additional cost for power plants to purchase emission allowances the final product price of electricity may increase resulting in a rising intermediate electricity input for all sectors part of such input would be transferred to the final consumers as japan and china share a close economic relationship it is necessary to investigate the impact of national ets in china on the final consumptions in japan especially food consumption another reason lies in the interdependency of electricity and hybrid energy water assuming that the technology level physical input coefficient in this paper would not change in the short run the changes in all direct and indirect energy uses and water withdraws may reveal the impact of climate policy on resources conservation table 1 shows the mechanism of ets s impact on few nexus in a simplified io framework this paper assumes that the total demand of japan and china in physical unit remains the same as well as the physical input coefficient of producers and the consumption preference of consumers the influence mechanism starts at an additional input in electricity supply sector in china due to the national ets μ and ends in an increase in the final consumptions of japan and china in step 1 the original emission abatement cost μ results in an increase in the total input of electricity sector and an increase with the same amount in the total output according to the production balance in step 2 the total increase in the output would fully be distributed to the intermediate output of electricity supply sector in china considering the nature of this industry generally electricity supply sectors operate with competitive markets and cost based pricing in many countries however the energy industry in china has been operating with a highly regulated dispatch and the two part pricing system such regulation resulted in a lack of channels to convey emission abatement costs between consumers and producers within this sector therefore this paper assumes that currently the producers of the electricity supply sector of china would take the full responsibility of the additional emission abatement cost and the only channel left to convey their cost to the final consumers is through the intermediate inputs to other sectors μ i i n 9 μ i i n μ a i j x i a i j x i in step 3 this paper assumes that producers in all sectors except the electricity supply sector would convey a certain share σ i of their additional cost to the end use consumers the rest 1 σ i would be reflected as a negative vector in the value added matrix this paper assumes that producers in all sectors except electricity supply sector would convey a certain share σ i of their additional cost to the end use consumers the rest 1 σ i would be reflected as a negative vector in the value added matrix in the case of electricity supply sectors σ i are all zero the markup ratio of entities was adopted as an indicator of σ i as the percentage that producers wish to convey the additional costs to consumers should be at least larger their original markup ratio in io framework the total operating surplus on total outputs were used to represent markup ratios 10 μ i c σ i μ i i n 11 μ i v μ i i n σ i μ i i n where μ i c represents the consumers share of the additional costs in all sectors due to the rising intermediate inputs from the electricity supply sector μ i v represents the producer s share in step 4 the total increases of final consumption and in total output in all sectors are μ c in step 5 μ i c would be distributed to the final consumers in japan μ i c j and the final consumers in china μ i c c 12 μ i c j μ i c y i j c j y i j c j 13 μ i c c μ i c y i j c c y i j c c 2 4 indicators for availability resilience and dominance of few nexus food energy and water are the fundamental drivers of regional development and convey the interdependencies between natural resources and human wellbeing this paper considers the most essential indicators of few nexus as i availability the amount of food produced to feed the population and serve other production needs within the region ii resilience namely the system robustness against droughts floods and other climate hazards iii dominance or the impact of indirect flows namely to what extent one region relies on another region on few uses the availability resilience and dominance indicators of few nexus are adopted based on the ena ecological network analysis framework the availability of few nexus can be reflected by network utility analysis nua mutual relationships among network compartments can be expressed by the direct utility matrix d and integral utility matrix u lu et al 2015 based on the results of food energy water flows eqs 6 8 the direct utility between sector i and j d i j is 14 d i j f i j f j i t i where f i j represents the food or hybrid energy or hybrid water from sector i to sector j t i represents the total input or output flows of i th sector 15 u i d d 2 d 3 d 4 i d 1 u shows all direct and indirect utilities of food or hybrid energy or hybrid water network it also reflects the strength of network organization this paper introduced s i g n d and s i g n u as sign matrices in order to simplify mutual relationships quantified by direct utilities and integral utilities mutual interactions between sectors can be interpreted as conditions of mutualism exploitation being exploited competition and neutrality 0 0 fath 2007 network mutualism index m i indicates the ratio of positive and negative utilities while synergism index s i quantifies the total magnitude of them chen and chen 2012 16 m i s i g n d s i g n d 17 s i u i j where s i g n d m a x s i g h u i j 0 s i g n d m i n s i g h u i j 0 system mutualism and synergism occurs when m i 1 or s i 0 resilience of few nexus can be reflected by the system robustness sr by considering the balance between flows efficiency and redundancy ulanowlcz and

represents the total output flows of food energy water network therefore the system robustness indicator s r can be calculated as 20 s r a c l o g a c dominance of indirect effects in few nexus can be reflected by indicator i d which shows to what extent one region or sector relies on another region or sector on few uses indirect effect refers to any effect that requires an intermediary node to mediate the transfer and can be of any length fath et al 2013 in this paper the strength of indirectness has been measured in a ratio of the sum of the indirect flows intensities divided by the direct flow intensities 21 f in u ˆ ax 22 g i j f i j i n f j 23 n i g 1 24 i d i j 1 n n i j g i j δ i j i j 1 n n i j where δ i j the kronecker delta 1 if and only if i j and is 0 otherwise the dominance of indirect effects occurs when i d is greater than one 3 results and discussion this section shows the mapping results of the few nexus flows followed with potential flow shifts and the increase in household expenditures due to the application of ets in china indicators showing the availability resilience dominance and monetary flow changes of the few nexus after ets are also listed 3 1 hybrid flows in the few nexus of japan and china in the target year the total export of japan to china in monetary unit overweighed the total export form china to japan the main trade flows from japan to china were dominated by manufacture sectors and sectors in the service industry however the following mapping results show that the hybrid energy flows of two countries were nearly symmetric moreover the hybrid water and food related extraction flows from china to japan were inversely larger than the flows from japan to china such differences were related to the differences in the interdependency structures of two countries as shown in figs 2 4 compared with the pattern of bilateral monetary input flows the pattern of hybrid energy flows was similar to the export structure of two countries nearly symmetrical dominated by manufacture sectors and sectors in the service industry however the share of china s total input flows to japan are less than the share of china s energy flows to japan indicating that sectors generating flows from china to japan are more energy intensive the results of hidden hybrid energy flows show that if china keeps its export oriented economic growth strategy its development will not be sustainable it may soon be restrained by the scarcity of domestic energy supply and environmental pressures compared with the pattern of monetary input flows and hybrid energy flows the pattern of hybrid water flows was more imbalanced with a 93 96 of bilateral hybrid water transactions induced by the total demands of japan according to this paper such imbalance resulted from high water withdraw intensities in china and large bilateral imports of agriculture related sectors in japan the top three flows japan imported from china were all from cultivating sectors with an average hybrid water withdraw intensity of 4 30 m m3 m eur which is more water intensive when compared to the production of food processing an average of 0 04 m m3 m eur and manufacturing an average of 0 01 m m3 m eur besides rice cereal grains and oil seeds all other cultivating sectors contributed to 1 45 b m3 21 06 of the bilateral hybrid water flows according to liu et al 2015 if considering all direct and indirect consumption of water four river basins in china suffered from a moderate to severe annual water scarcity in 2010 the haihe huaihe liaohe and huanghe basins in china the competing demands of water for national production and international trade have existed and may still exist in the next two decades it is also essential to prove the value added of cultivating products expanding the exports in water intensive sectors may worsen the water shortages in china the pattern of food related extraction flows was even more imbalanced when compared to the pattern of hybrid water flows 98 96 of bilateral hybrid water transactions were induced by the total demands of japan japan has been highly dependent on the food supply of china nearly 16 11 of the direct food related extractions according to the results of this paper among which cereal grains 22 60 vegetables fruit nuts 20 80 paddy rice 16 66 sugar cane and sugar beet 10 50 and wheat 8 14 contributed most to the bilateral food supply in the target year japan s food self sufficiency ratio was 79 in 1960 but it fell rapidly in the last 45 years to the lowest among countries with more than 100 million in population kako 2010 although japan has held stable accesses to imported foods nature hazards trade policy negotiations and food security regulation changes in food supply countries such as china may still cause direct economic losses and increase food price volatility in japan it is still essential for japan to keep its food self sufficiency in order to get less exposed to such risks 3 2 impacts of the projected ets this paper assumed that the emission mitigation goal would be 5 of the original level with 90 initial allowances allocated for free and an average market price of 30 yuan t therefore the total additional abatement cost due to ets would be 40 10 m eur table 2 shows the impacts of this assumed ets scenario the increase rate of total input in the electricity supply sector in china would be 0 0142 the average increase rate of total input in all other sectors in china would be around 0 0060 the market price this paper adopted 30 yuan t could be further increased to the official guidance price 200 yuan t the sectors where total input increased most due to the application of ets ranged from water supply 0 059 to cultivation processing manufacture of food e g raw milk processing of meat cattle processing of meat pigs sugar refining and manufacture of tobacco products different from ets an environmental tax may increase the additional abatement costs in all sectors proportionally therefore the sectors with a smaller total input may be influenced more by the ets it is essential to set an effective limitation for the coverage of ets unless the entity has an annual revenue average of past three five years above such limitation it should not be covered by ets the projected ets may increase the total household expenditure of japan imported from china in sugar refining 1 3096 processing vegetable oils and fats 0 1164 and processing of meat cattle 0 1010 these sectors in japan were facing the highest food price volatility risk in other words ets may weaken the price competitiveness of china s exports in these sectors 3 3 availability resilience and dominance indicators of few nexus the indicators of the total monetary flows in table 3 can be viewed as the baseline when analyzing the few nexus in all three networks network mutualism indicators were less than one while the network synergism indicators were larger than zero the synergism in the network of food related extractions was less than the synergism of the total monetary flows as cultivation processing and manufacture of food were less dependent to other sectors when compared to hybrid energy and hybrid water the dominance of indirect effects was smaller than the baseline in all three networks while the system robustness was larger especially the hybrid water network and food network like the network formed by total monetary flows between japan and china sectors in the energy system tend to be connected by more intricate and dense flows resulting in a higher redundancy all indicators remained nearly the same in the ets scenario network mutualism system robustness and the dominance of indirect effects decreased slightly while the network synergism increased slightly based on the assumption of constant exchange amount in physical units the introduction of ets would strengthen the density of hybrid energy flows in monetary units as an ets would directly influence the electricity supply sector which is most related to energy supply along with the stronger interdependence in hybrid energy nexus in the bilateral system the introduction of ets would result in a stronger synergism and a higher redundancy in all economic activities including food related sectors in both countries and reducing the system robustness of the bilateral nexus 4 conclusion this paper mapped the hybrid flows in the few nexus of japan and china in 2007 by an io based model in order to figure out the interdependencies of hybrid energy hybrid water and food extractions with other production sectors in two countries the pattern of hybrid energy flows was nearly symmetrical dominated by manufacture sectors and the service industry the pattern of hybrid water and food related extraction flows were more imbalanced due to the high dependence of japan on the food supply of china 16 11 for china the policy of maintaining 95 self sufficiency in grain production signifies the strategic importance of its agriculture sector white et al 2017 considering the competing demands of water for national production and international trade it is essential to improve the value added of cultivating products and to mitigate the expansion in the exports of water intensive products for japan keeping and increasing its food self sufficiency by expanding the food supplier countries may help japan get less exposed to the global food price volatility especially external shocks in its main food supplier china the sectors where total input increased most due to the projected application of a national emission trading scheme in china ranged from electricity water supply to cultivation processing manufacture of foods e g raw milk processing of meat cattle processing of meat pigs sugar refining and manufacture of tobacco products according to this paper the projected ets may increase japan s total household expenditure on imported goods from china in the fields of sugar refining 1 3096 processing vegetable oils and fats 0 1164 and processing of meat cattle 0 1010 for japan these sectors were facing the highest food price volatility risk for china ets may weaken the price competitiveness of exports in these sectors network synergism occurs in hybrid energy hybrid water and food related extraction networks the dominance of indirect effects was smaller than the one of the total monetary flows in all three networks while the system robustness was larger especially the hybrid water network and the food network all indicators remained nearly the same in the ets scenario network mutualism system robustness and the dominance of indirect effects decreased slightly while the network synergism

25158,plants are open irreversible and non equilibrium systems that live via mass and energy exchanges with the environment and therefore are amenable to a thermodynamic treatment in fact they may be considered energy converters because their metabolism is nothing else than a controlled ability to transform energy from one form solar into another chemical energy suitable to cell metabolism and to activate and maintain reactions at cellular and molecular level promoting the plant growth this paper presents an original model based on mass conservation and on the first and second law of thermodynamics which results in a set of equations that allow for the calculation of the primary productivity npp and consequently lead to a measure of the plant growth the model is lumped steady state and totally deterministic because no primary process is modelled in detail the control volume is a portion of the universe that contains the plant and its immediate surroundings atmosphere and the relevant portion of the soil and the solution is strongly depending on the imposed boundary conditions in such a formulation the tree is considered as a non equilibrium system evolving at a steady rate and the only implicit assumption is the local equilibrium hypothesis the general evolution equations are derived and their steady state form is analysed in detail the approach is based on the calculation of the exergy in and outflows from the control volume based on reasonably accurate empirical data the exergy budget shows that the overall exergy conversion efficiency is quite low in plants and is very sensitive to even small changes in the environmental condition and to the adopted evapotranspiration model as it would have been expected the model is applied to a mature specimen of pinus sylvestris and the results are compared with some literature data despite neglecting the real chemo physical details the model reproduces the most salient characters of the tree growth the sensitivity of the results to the tree age as well to the main model parameters is also calculated the application of the same model to different species may reveal asymmetries in the adaptability of certain genotypes to different environments on the more specific engineering side the model may see an immediate application in the estimate of co2 capture by plants keywords exergy analysis non

introduction a living system absorbs high enthalpy low entropy compounds from its surroundings in the form of solar radiation water and relatively simple chemical compounds transforming them in different forms of chemical thermal and mechanical energy it uses a portion of the latter to build and keep its ordered low entropy structure and returns low enthalpy high entropy compounds to the environment from a thermodynamic point of view it keeps its low entropy by means of a negative entropy variation increasing the entropy of environment this consideration originated famous statements like the general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials nor for energy but a struggle for negative entropy which becomes available through the transition of energy from the hot sun to the cold earth boltzmann 1886 and a living organism lives on negative entropy schrödinger 1944 as it will be shown below what both statements really mean is that a living organism thrives on the available energy it can draw from the environment 1 1 both boltzmann and schrödinger were of course aware of this and the latter explicitly restated his negentropy in terms of the available gibbs energy in the second edition of his book what s life 1944 see also lotka 1922 prigogine 1980 and schneider and kay 1994a 1994b in thermodynamics an open system with an entropy lower than that of its surroundings is necessarily in a non equilibrium state a living system always operates as the result of a balance between the tendency to return to equilibrium death and the effort to preserve an almost steady state that is not too far from equilibrium 2 2 not too far is a rather vague but convenient formulation of the more rigorous statement the state of the system in its phase space is within a certain hyperradius rnear eq from the equilibrium state forest growth is affected in a complex way by a variety of external factors resulting in large differences in the productivity changes of different plant species the current trend of increasingly frequent drought events 45 affects the primary productivity of the forest well beyond the duration of the extreme climate event 9 any attempt to formulate an accurate climate change scenario requires an identification of the factors that affect plant growth and a numerical estimate of their quantitative effects to this goal several growth models have been formulated bregaglio et al 2016 most of them being based on a rational fitting of statistically treated and species specific experimental data each model results in a specific set of correlations linking one or more external variables climate soil properties etc to primary productivity pp i e the actual amount of carbon allocated moles of c to plant growth per unit time per area there were also attempts to formulate thermodynamic models especially for the small scale phenomena allen et al 1998 austoni et al 2007 bregaglio et al 2016 burns limm 2011 at the larger scales boyer 1969 quantified the water transport into plants in terms of its enthalpy mosimann mosimann et al 2006 studied the soil to root absorption constant some molecular processes were treated among others by dragicevic dragicevic and sredojevic 2011 and mccarthy mccarthy and macey 2001 plant respiration rate was addressed in a systemic view by thomley thornley and cannell 2000 the net pp balance was examined by gifford 1994 2003 and ciais ciais et al 2005 some models for atp dynamics in mitochondria have been proposed by demirel 2007 the model proposed in this paper is novel on two counts first it is based solely on a mass and energy balance of a well defined control volume second it makes use of the thermodynamic function exergy which depends both on the first and second law prescriptions and therefore contains the same amount of information as the two laws but introduces one additional equation the exergy budget that is very useful for the solution of the problem and for the assessment of the results 2 exergy 2 1 definition of the concept the word exergy first appeared in an archival publication in the late 50 s rant 1956 3 3 for the sake of conciseness we must omit here the majority of the large body of references on exergy interested readers are referred to sciubba and zullo 2012 which though somewhat dated contains the largest and most systematic reference on this topic but the concept was discussed already in gibbs and maxwell s writings where the idea that only a well identified and measurable portion of the energy content of a body or of a stream can be transformed in mechanical work it was clearly formulated in the works of clausius gouy and keenan and later in those of bosnjakovic darrieus jouget and gochstein for a commented history of exergy see sciubba and wall 2007 mention is made of a thermodynamic function named available energy or availability or maximum potential work defined for a homogeneous system in state 1 as 1 e x 1 e x 1 t e x 1 c e x 1 k e x 1 p e x 1 n h 1 h 0 t 0 s 1 s 0 j δ g j r t 0 x j ln x j x 0 j 5 v 2 g g z z 0 e x n in eq 1 following a notation suggested by ellenberg 1988 the global specific quantity exergy has been split into its constituents i e its thermodynamic chemical kinetic potential nuclear components each one of which can be exactly and deterministically related to the state properties of the system and to a reference environment an infinite capacity reservoir a macro system that is and remains in a state defined by t t0 p p0 cj cj 0 etc thus constituting a zero reference to be maintained constant for the ensuing calculations to remain congruent in the following we shall be concerned here only with the thermodynamic and chemical components defined as 4 4 it is understood that the enthalpy term represents the total enthalpy i e includes the kinetic and potential in the case of a liquid energy as well 2 e x 1 h 1 h 0 t 0 s 1 s 0 j δ g j r t 0 ln c j c 0 j eq 2 expresses the most important attribute of exergy in all real processes the amount of useful work that can be extracted from a certain system is not measured by its enthalpic content because a portion of the latter is devaluated by the inevitable irreversible entropic degradation similar relations apply to the remaining components exergy represents the maximum work that we can extract from a system by means of ideally reversible transformations that bring it to a state of complete statistical equilibrium with its reference state sometimes called the dead state conversely the exergy of a substance in state 1 represents the minimum cumulative amount of work equivalent necessarily needed to raise its energy level both quantitatively and qualitatively from the dead state to state 1 notice that to spontaneously evolve from one state to the other the system must be originally in a non equilibrium state and within the terms of the present paper it is necessary to posit the local equilibrium hypothesis to be able to describe the path of the evolution in the phase space to place the exergy method applied here in a clearer context it is important to summarize the most important properties of exergy from the perspective of a system analysis 1 exergy requires the definition of a reference state which must be maintained fixed for all calculations to remain congruent 2 a system s in a state a fig 1 a can deliver a maximum amount of useful mechanical work equal to its exergy exa 0 conversely a system s in state 0 can be brought to state a by an expenditure of mechanical work at least equal to and for irreversible transformations always larger than its exergy exa 0 exa ex0 3 if a system s moves from state a to state b the maximum work that can be extracted in the process is exa exb vice versa the minimum amount of work to be expended to bring s from b to a is exb exa in any real cyclic process exergy is destroyed 4 for the classical case of an internally reversible system in thermal contact with two reservoirs one at th and the other at tl fig 1b the maximum work that can be produced by a cyclic process is affected by two types of exergy losses one at the hot end proportional to th ta and the other at the cold end proportional to ta tl this is of course nothing more than another statement of the carnot limit efficiency 5 exergy is additive if a stream f1 enters a process p with an exergy level ex1 and receives a contribution ex2 in a first component thereof ex3 in a second component and so on it exits p in a state say f4 with an exergy equal to the net i e subtracted of the irreversible exergetic destruction exδ sum of the single contributions fig 1c 6 because of the previous point a cumulative exergy content for a complex process can be defined szargut et al 1988 as the sum of all inputs normalized by the unit mass flow or exergy content of the product by doing this it is also natural to define the exergetic efficiency of each sub process as the ratio of the exergetic content of the useful output to the sum of the expended exergetic inputs or to use a more rational terminology of the product to the fuel 7 a material stream can thus be assigned an exergetic content simply by augmenting the initial value of the raw exergy of the pristine input the material as extracted from the earth crust by all the contributions it receives during a specified process different databases have been compiled for such raw state exergy values and the one proposed by szargut szargut et al 1988 is adopted here a vast bibliography exists on exergetic analysis of energy conversion systems it is fair to say that in general the method of exergy analysis has improved our understanding of the related physical phenomena in two ways a a at a theoretical level it resulted in the formulation of an internally coherent quantitative and methodologically complete procedure of analysis that generates a clear picture of both the quality type and source and the quantity relative amount of the irreversible losses occurring in an energy conversion process b at a practical level it provided the foundation for more complete and thermodynamically rigorous analyses which resulted in thousands of applications to known and new components and systems design and or revamping 2 2 when is an exergy analysis useful and why the intuition that exergy could be used for the analysis of living systems predates by two decades the schrödinger s book in an anticipatory paper published in 1921 lotka 1922 stated that when the body of a living organism in not in equilibrium with its surroundings but it is in an approximately steady state every organism must be provided with devices for capturing available energy and that due to the competition for survival the advantage must go to those whose energy capturing devices are most effective in directing available energy into such channels as are favourable to the preservation of the species this statement is entirely equivalent lucia and sciubba 2013 to saying that prevailing organisms are those that destroy the least possible portion of the incoming exergy i e that operate with the smallest irreversibility or equivalently with the highest exergy conversion efficiency along this line of reasoning exergy methods have been applied in the analysis of biological systems from the first generalistic proposals by wall 1986 and ayres et al 1998 to the specific studies by austoni et al 2007 libralato et al 2006 jørgensen 2007a b jørgensen and mejer 1979 jørgensen et al 2005a marques et al 1997 in jørgensen et al 2005b jørgensen introduced a sort of structural exergy with the absolute equilibrium as a reference state designed to account for the internal organization of living organisms arguing that this type of approach could have important implications in our understanding of ordered life structures but also that further experimental proofs were still needed hau and bakshi 2004 also studied the possible extension of the concept of exergy to biological structures a recent review of the merits and limits of the exergy analysis is presented by dewulf et al 2008 sciubba and zullo 2012 formulated an exergy based population dynamic model and applied it to two species thriving on the same resource pool under three different types of interaction cooperation competition and parasitism some authors applied the exergy method without explicitly mentioning it for example dragicevic and sredojevic 2011 derived a correlation based on δg and δs but did not link it to δex δh t0δs the application procedure for an exergy analysis exa is as follows a define the control volume to which the analysis is to be applied this volume must include the immediate surroundings of the system dunbar et al 1992 b draw a detailed flow chart of the system under consideration paying attention to the proper level of aggregation at which the representation is made an excessive disaggregation too much detail requires more extensive calculations and demands for very detailed data often not available in practice an excessively low disaggregation causes the lumping of possibly dissimilar data into a single input or output invariably leading to the implicit or explicit formulation of assumptions that may detract from the generality of the method c identify the thermodynamic state of all fluxes and quantify their relevant properties temperature pressure enthalpy entropy composition and concentration chemical potentials etc d perform a mass and energy balance first at component and then at system level too often the two are not consistent iterations should be performed until exact closures are obtained e derive an exergy budget for each component to compute its exergy destruction and extend it to system level the calculation flowsheet will in general comprise the headings shown in tables 1 and 2 f define and compute the relevant exergy efficiencies 3 problem formulation an exergy based model for plant growth considering the schematic representation of the system plant given in fig 2 the problem may be formulated as follows i given the control volume sketched in the figure and ii considering that both the atmosphere and soil around the system are and remain in a uniform thermodynamic state defined by temperature t0 pressure p0 and a set of concentrations c0j for j 1 to j well identified components iii derive the exergy budget of the system and calculate its total exδ and the conversion efficiency of the system plant 3 1 mass balance in this paper mass flowrates are expressed for convenience in kg s trees acquire mass by four mechanisms 1 water absorption by the roots rather than attempting to calculate the direct absorption on the roots surface the model assumes that water diffuses from the external soil at constant concentration c0 w to the soil internal to the control volume at cwr the net water inflow from ground mwg can be computed based on in vivo experiments τg being the portion of time in which absorption is active i e the plant is actively absorbing nutrients and ψr is a model factor that accounts

they examined this secondary water acquisition strategy is widespread across species and is not limited to those exposed to a constant humid wind water uptake increases foliar hydration and it does not depend on the availability of primary soil water water penetrates through the cuticle slatyer 2018 and therefore the model assumes that water diffuses from external fog at constant concentration

in calculating the energy balance of a leaf or a plant gond et al 1999 hargreaves and samani 1985 marques et al 1997 stankova et al 2016 vitale et al 2003 is the fact that this phenomenon must be split into two terms the first etr expresses the enthalpy of the liquid water that transpires hw and the second evap represents the cooling caused by the subtraction of a portion of the enthalpy of evaporation from the leaves to the air while there is no problem in quantifying the first term the second one poses some problems because it consists in a combination of convection and evaporation cooling and therefore includes both the enthalpy of evaporation hfg and a convective contribution that is very difficult to calculate in the model we adopted a more standard formulation james et al

called pumping term the sap is indeed pumped from the roots to the leaves by a combination of capillary effects osmotic pressure cohesion tension effects and probably some turgor induced action but within the frame of the present analysis we are only interested in the amount of power exchanged through the boundaries of the control volume so that the plant must draw this pumping energy from its internal dynamics 3 3 exergy budget exergy does not respect a conservation law and a portion of it is in fact destroyed in every real process it is more correct to speak of an exergy budget instead of a balance for convenience it is though useful to write a virtual algebraic balance by introducing a fictitious flux equal to the exergy destruction rate keeping in mind that this term is not a physically measurable quantity but is indeed the unknown in the exergy budget equation e x i n e x o u t e x δ since the mass and energy flowrates can be derived from their respective balance equations the exergy balance leads to the calculation of the irreversible exergy destruction rate which can be shown to be proportional to the total entropy generation rate 18 e x δ e x i n e x o u t

plant conversion efficiency it is necessary to qualify the exergy fluxes as products and fuels the prescriptions of the exergy analysis method are rather intuitive tsatsaronis and winhold 1985 we define as product any exergy flux that exits the control volume and can be in principle used by external users similarly a fuel is any exergy flux that enters the control volume and is used by the system for its internal processes in the case of a living system no flow can be assumed to be a wasteful discharge because each trophic level feeds the one immediately below in a way that all raw material is continuously recycled within the food chain in this frame plant re radiation contributes to the local albedo plant evaporation contributes to the local microclimate and plant litter is degraded into humus and mineral salts accordingly e x w g e x n g e x w w e x s w e x s u n e x c o n v are fuels and e x e v e x r e r e x l e x n p p are products the resource conversion efficiency of the tree is then 20 η e x e x p r o d u c t s e x f u e l s e x n p p e x e v e x r e r e x l i t e x w s e x n g e x w w e x s w e x i r r e x c o n v e x i n e x o u t e x i n 1 e x δ e x i n but from the point of view of the system tree it may be also stated that the only product that really matters is its own growth related to the net solar irradiation impinging on the system e x s u n e x r

further new production eqs 20 and 21 demonstrate that the conversion efficiency of a tree can be expressed in terms of three sets of parameters the plant shape quantities h rt rb rc rb rr the physio chemical properties of the substances it extracts from and releases to the surroundings and a number of site dependent environmental data i τs τev t0 cws etc all these quantities are either known or can be directly measured in the field 4 validation of the model the model was applied to an isolated specimen of pinus sylvestris scots pine tables 2 and 3 report the environmental and model

valladares 2006 and although the species tolerates all kinds of site conditions it shows best growth on fertile soils intermediate dgbs type ellenberg 1988 where however it is outcompeted by picea or broad leaved tree species such as fagus sylvatica notice that soil with an intermediate dgbs type is most likely associated with a balanced nutrition of trees with no soil acidification however the exact nature of the soil is neglected in this analysis it was assumed that mineral salts absorbed through the roots were k and mg augmented kaolinite dolomite and ammonium nitrate the respective exergy values were adapted from szargut et al 1988 first of all the npp growth calculated with our model was compared with some field results by krankina 2011 for a 25 m plant age 60 yrs the model results gave 510 kg yr against an experimental maximum of 534 well within the tolerance this is a very satisfactory result especially in view of the completely lumped model discussed here for the reference case age 20years h0 10 m t0 280 k pirr 400 w m2 the results of the calculation are in almost perfect agreement with the field data of peltola peltola et al 2018 and magnani magnani et al 2009 figs 5 7 report the water balance the global and solar exergy efficiency respectively it appears that the respiration and evapotranspiration are also satisfactorily predicted figs 8 and 9 report the values of absorbed o2 absorbed n2 and of the released co2 as a function of tree age these are all daily averages over the year since no daily or seasonal variation is accounted for in our model table 4 reports the results of a simulation carried out on a 20 years old specimen of pinus sylvestris height h0 10 m the average growth is 0 586 m yr the amount of litter 5 3 kg yr the energy balance is closed within 7 6 which is sufficiently accurate given the range of the total input ein 6040 w and output eout 5580 w the evapotranspiration index et0 5 05 mm d an acceptable value 6 6 the evapotranspiration index et0 is a measure of the amount of water released into the atmosphere by a certain colture which corresponds therefore to its minimum watering requirements its values vary with climate type of soil and plant type acceptable values for the pinus sylvestris in its niche lie between 4 and 6 mm day 19 the plant releases 24 3 l day of water the global exergy efficiency is ηex 0 00085 but if it is calculated with respect to the radiation balance it becomes ηnpp 0 028 the net plant production yields 3 5 10 5 kg s of new biomass with an assumed growth period of 165 days year which corresponds to 0 95kgc m2 soil yr under an projected canopy surface of 50 m2 and a projected leaf area index of 2 15 m2 leaf m2 soil β table 3 gond et al 1999 this value is similar to results measured by magnani magnani et al 2009 in pinus sylvestris trees of similar age and height i e about 0 9 kgc m2 soil yr the agreement with different field data peltola et al 2018 is also good for a tree of h0 10 6 m the new trunk radius calculated by the model table 5 is 0 1 m vs the 0 101 0 126 m measured by peltola peltola et al 2018 5 model sensitivity a sensitivity study was performed to verify the influence of environmental and structure parameters such as irradiation rate initial tree height and air temperature on the yearly growth of pinus sylvestris and on its exergy efficiency some results are shown in figs 10 15 for a mature tree 40 years h0 19 m the growth in height m y increases almost linearly with the irradiation fig 10 which is congruent with the graph of fig 4 since the proportional allocation of gross primary production to trunk branches root and leaves was maintained constant across the calculations this implies that even mature trees have an energetic interest to grow in height and crown because by so doing their solar efficiency eq 21 increases fig 7 and they can better compete for solar irradiation with respect to their neighbours in fact both the net npp and the solar efficiency eq 21 increase quadratically with the irradiation figs 11 12 the influence of the ambient temperature t0 is shown in figs 13 15 δh and npp increase with increasing t0 a higher evapotranspiration is apparently compensated by a higher water intake from the ground while ηnpp eqtn 21 reaches a peak for t0 280 k and decreases both for higher and lower t0 the latter result depends on two competing effects schär et al 2004 varone et al 2015 the decrease of the exergy of reradiation with higher t0 and the corresponding variation of the evapotranspiration with increasing t0 table 6 6 discussion and conclusions a lumped steady state model of a conifer pinus sylvestris is presented and discussed the model is based on global mass and energy balances and leads to the calculation of the exergy efficiency of the system tree the results are in satisfactory agreement with field data and their sensitivity to different environmental factors displays physically reasonable trends two different exergetic efficiencies were defined the first eq 20 represents the performance of the conversion from the total exergy inputs into plant growth while the second eq 21 is a measure of the importance of the exergy destruction with reference to the radiation reradiation budget the total conversion efficiency for the reference case age 20 years h0 10 m t0 280 k pirr 400 w m2 is about 0 00085 while the exergy destruction amounts to about 0 997 of the difference between the absorbed solar radiation and the plant reradiation the model is extremely sensitive to the evapotranspiration index et0 and this is indicative that further investigations are needed a word of caution is necessary the model is totally deterministic it considers the tree as being frozen in a steady state over the entire year and it depends on many model parameters some of which can only be adjusted only by heuristic considerations it is noteworthy that despite neglecting the real molecular scale chemo physical details of plant growth our lumped model can reproduce the most salient characters of the phenomenon application of the same model to different species may reveal asymmetries in the adaptability of certain genotypes to different environments on the more specific engineering side the model may see an immediate application in the estimate of co2 capture by plants muys 2013 walentowski et al 2013 perhaps more important from a thermodynamic point of view it leads to the calculation of the primary exergy resources invested in the generation of npp a true exergetic cost that may have many important applications in sustainability studies 
25158,plants are open irreversible and non equilibrium systems that live via mass and energy exchanges with the environment and therefore are amenable to a thermodynamic treatment in fact they may be considered energy converters because their metabolism is nothing else than a controlled ability to transform energy from one form solar into another chemical energy suitable to cell metabolism and to activate and maintain reactions at cellular and molecular level promoting the plant growth this paper presents an original model based on mass conservation and on the first and second law of thermodynamics which results in a set of equations that allow for the calculation of the primary productivity npp and consequently lead to a measure of the plant growth the model is lumped steady state and totally deterministic because no primary process is modelled in detail the control volume is a portion of the universe that contains the plant and its immediate surroundings atmosphere and the relevant portion of the soil and the solution is strongly depending on the imposed boundary conditions in such a formulation the tree is considered as a non equilibrium system evolving at a steady rate and the only implicit assumption is the local equilibrium hypothesis the general evolution equations are derived and their steady state form is analysed in detail the approach is based on the calculation of the exergy in and outflows from the control volume based on reasonably accurate empirical data the exergy budget shows that the overall exergy conversion efficiency is quite low in plants and is very sensitive to even small changes in the environmental condition and to the adopted evapotranspiration model as it would have been expected the model is applied to a mature specimen of pinus sylvestris and the results are compared with some literature data despite neglecting the real chemo physical details the model reproduces the most salient characters of the tree growth the sensitivity of the results to the tree age as well to the main model parameters is also calculated the application of the same model to different species may reveal asymmetries in the adaptability of certain genotypes to different environments on the more specific engineering side the model may see an immediate application in the estimate of co2 capture by plants keywords exergy analysis non

introduction a living system absorbs high enthalpy low entropy compounds from its surroundings in the form of solar radiation water and relatively simple chemical compounds transforming them in different forms of chemical thermal and mechanical energy it uses a portion of the latter to build and keep its ordered low entropy structure and returns low enthalpy high entropy compounds to the environment from a thermodynamic point of view it keeps its low entropy by means of a negative entropy variation increasing the entropy of environment this consideration originated famous statements like the general struggle for existence of animate beings is not a struggle for raw materials nor for energy but a struggle for negative entropy which becomes available through the transition of energy from the hot sun to the cold earth boltzmann 1886 and a living organism lives on negative entropy schrödinger 1944 as it will be shown below what both statements really mean is that a living organism thrives on the available energy it can draw from the environment 1 1 both boltzmann and schrödinger were of course aware of this and the latter explicitly restated his negentropy in terms of the available gibbs energy in the second edition of his book what s life 1944 see also lotka 1922 prigogine 1980 and schneider and kay 1994a 1994b in thermodynamics an open system with an entropy lower than that of its surroundings is necessarily in a non equilibrium state a living system always operates as the result of a balance between the tendency to return to equilibrium death and the effort to preserve an almost steady state that is not too far from equilibrium 2 2 not too far is a rather vague but convenient formulation of the more rigorous statement the state of the system in its phase space is within a certain hyperradius rnear eq from the equilibrium state forest growth is affected in a complex way by a variety of external factors resulting in large differences in the productivity changes of different plant species the current trend of increasingly frequent drought events 45 affects the primary productivity of the forest well beyond the duration of the extreme climate event 9 any attempt to formulate an accurate climate change scenario requires an identification of the factors that affect plant growth and a numerical estimate of their quantitative effects to this goal several growth models have been formulated bregaglio et al 2016 most of them being based on a rational fitting of statistically treated and species specific experimental data each model results in a specific set of correlations linking one or more external variables climate soil properties etc to primary productivity pp i e the actual amount of carbon allocated moles of c to plant growth per unit time per area there were also attempts to formulate thermodynamic models especially for the small scale phenomena allen et al 1998 austoni et al 2007 bregaglio et al 2016 burns limm 2011 at the larger scales boyer 1969 quantified the water transport into plants in terms of its enthalpy mosimann mosimann et al 2006 studied the soil to root absorption constant some molecular processes were treated among others by dragicevic dragicevic and sredojevic 2011 and mccarthy mccarthy and macey 2001 plant respiration rate was addressed in a systemic view by thomley thornley and cannell 2000 the net pp balance was examined by gifford 1994 2003 and ciais ciais et al 2005 some models for atp dynamics in mitochondria have been proposed by demirel 2007 the model proposed in this paper is novel on two counts first it is based solely on a mass and energy balance of a well defined control volume second it makes use of the thermodynamic function exergy which depends both on the first and second law prescriptions and therefore contains the same amount of information as the two laws but introduces one additional equation the exergy budget that is very useful for the solution of the problem and for the assessment of the results 2 exergy 2 1 definition of the concept the word exergy first appeared in an archival publication in the late 50 s rant 1956 3 3 for the sake of conciseness we must omit here the majority of the large body of references on exergy interested readers are referred to sciubba and zullo 2012 which though somewhat dated contains the largest and most systematic reference on this topic but the concept was discussed already in gibbs and maxwell s writings where the idea that only a well identified and measurable portion of the energy content of a body or of a stream can be transformed in mechanical work it was clearly formulated in the works of clausius gouy and keenan and later in those of bosnjakovic darrieus jouget and gochstein for a commented history of exergy see sciubba and wall 2007 mention is made of a thermodynamic function named available energy or availability or maximum potential work defined for a homogeneous system in state 1 as 1 e x 1 e x 1 t e x 1 c e x 1 k e x 1 p e x 1 n h 1 h 0 t 0 s 1 s 0 j δ g j r t 0 x j ln x j x 0 j 5 v 2 g g z z 0 e x n in eq 1 following a notation suggested by ellenberg 1988 the global specific quantity exergy has been split into its constituents i e its thermodynamic chemical kinetic potential nuclear components each one of which can be exactly and deterministically related to the state properties of the system and to a reference environment an infinite capacity reservoir a macro system that is and remains in a state defined by t t0 p p0 cj cj 0 etc thus constituting a zero reference to be maintained constant for the ensuing calculations to remain congruent in the following we shall be concerned here only with the thermodynamic and chemical components defined as 4 4 it is understood that the enthalpy term represents the total enthalpy i e includes the kinetic and potential in the case of a liquid energy as well 2 e x 1 h 1 h 0 t 0 s 1 s 0 j δ g j r t 0 ln c j c 0 j eq 2 expresses the most important attribute of exergy in all real processes the amount of useful work that can be extracted from a certain system is not measured by its enthalpic content because a portion of the latter is devaluated by the inevitable irreversible entropic degradation similar relations apply to the remaining components exergy represents the maximum work that we can extract from a system by means of ideally reversible transformations that bring it to a state of complete statistical equilibrium with its reference state sometimes called the dead state conversely the exergy of a substance in state 1 represents the minimum cumulative amount of work equivalent necessarily needed to raise its energy level both quantitatively and qualitatively from the dead state to state 1 notice that to spontaneously evolve from one state to the other the system must be originally in a non equilibrium state and within the terms of the present paper it is necessary to posit the local equilibrium hypothesis to be able to describe the path of the evolution in the phase space to place the exergy method applied here in a clearer context it is important to summarize the most important properties of exergy from the perspective of a system analysis 1 exergy requires the definition of a reference state which must be maintained fixed for all calculations to remain congruent 2 a system s in a state a fig 1 a can deliver a maximum amount of useful mechanical work equal to its exergy exa 0 conversely a system s in state 0 can be brought to state a by an expenditure of mechanical work at least equal to and for irreversible transformations always larger than its exergy exa 0 exa ex0 3 if a system s moves from state a to state b the maximum work that can be extracted in the process is exa exb vice versa the minimum amount of work to be expended to bring s from b to a is exb exa in any real cyclic process exergy is destroyed 4 for the classical case of an internally reversible system in thermal contact with two reservoirs one at th and the other at tl fig 1b the maximum work that can be produced by a cyclic process is affected by two types of exergy losses one at the hot end proportional to th ta and the other at the cold end proportional to ta tl this is of course nothing more than another statement of the carnot limit efficiency 5 exergy is additive if a stream f1 enters a process p with an exergy level ex1 and receives a contribution ex2 in a first component thereof ex3 in a second component and so on it exits p in a state say f4 with an exergy equal to the net i e subtracted of the irreversible exergetic destruction exδ sum of the single contributions fig 1c 6 because of the previous point a cumulative exergy content for a complex process can be defined szargut et al 1988 as the sum of all inputs normalized by the unit mass flow or exergy content of the product by doing this it is also natural to define the exergetic efficiency of each sub process as the ratio of the exergetic content of the useful output to the sum of the expended exergetic inputs or to use a more rational terminology of the product to the fuel 7 a material stream can thus be assigned an exergetic content simply by augmenting the initial value of the raw exergy of the pristine input the material as extracted from the earth crust by all the contributions it receives during a specified process different databases have been compiled for such raw state exergy values and the one proposed by szargut szargut et al 1988 is adopted here a vast bibliography exists on exergetic analysis of energy conversion systems it is fair to say that in general the method of exergy analysis has improved our understanding of the related physical phenomena in two ways a a at a theoretical level it resulted in the formulation of an internally coherent quantitative and methodologically complete procedure of analysis that generates a clear picture of both the quality type and source and the quantity relative amount of the irreversible losses occurring in an energy conversion process b at a practical level it provided the foundation for more complete and thermodynamically rigorous analyses which resulted in thousands of applications to known and new components and systems design and or revamping 2 2 when is an exergy analysis useful and why the intuition that exergy could be used for the analysis of living systems predates by two decades the schrödinger s book in an anticipatory paper published in 1921 lotka 1922 stated that when the body of a living organism in not in equilibrium with its surroundings but it is in an approximately steady state every organism must be provided with devices for capturing available energy and that due to the competition for survival the advantage must go to those whose energy capturing devices are most effective in directing available energy into such channels as are favourable to the preservation of the species this statement is entirely equivalent lucia and sciubba 2013 to saying that prevailing organisms are those that destroy the least possible portion of the incoming exergy i e that operate with the smallest irreversibility or equivalently with the highest exergy conversion efficiency along this line of reasoning exergy methods have been applied in the analysis of biological systems from the first generalistic proposals by wall 1986 and ayres et al 1998 to the specific studies by austoni et al 2007 libralato et al 2006 jørgensen 2007a b jørgensen and mejer 1979 jørgensen et al 2005a marques et al 1997 in jørgensen et al 2005b jørgensen introduced a sort of structural exergy with the absolute equilibrium as a reference state designed to account for the internal organization of living organisms arguing that this type of approach could have important implications in our understanding of ordered life structures but also that further experimental proofs were still needed hau and bakshi 2004 also studied the possible extension of the concept of exergy to biological structures a recent review of the merits and limits of the exergy analysis is presented by dewulf et al 2008 sciubba and zullo 2012 formulated an exergy based population dynamic model and applied it to two species thriving on the same resource pool under three different types of interaction cooperation competition and parasitism some authors applied the exergy method without explicitly mentioning it for example dragicevic and sredojevic 2011 derived a correlation based on δg and δs but did not link it to δex δh t0δs the application procedure for an exergy analysis exa is as follows a define the control volume to which the analysis is to be applied this volume must include the immediate surroundings of the system dunbar et al 1992 b draw a detailed flow chart of the system under consideration paying attention to the proper level of aggregation at which the representation is made an excessive disaggregation too much detail requires more extensive calculations and demands for very detailed data often not available in practice an excessively low disaggregation causes the lumping of possibly dissimilar data into a single input or output invariably leading to the implicit or explicit formulation of assumptions that may detract from the generality of the method c identify the thermodynamic state of all fluxes and quantify their relevant properties temperature pressure enthalpy entropy composition and concentration chemical potentials etc d perform a mass and energy balance first at component and then at system level too often the two are not consistent iterations should be performed until exact closures are obtained e derive an exergy budget for each component to compute its exergy destruction and extend it to system level the calculation flowsheet will in general comprise the headings shown in tables 1 and 2 f define and compute the relevant exergy efficiencies 3 problem formulation an exergy based model for plant growth considering the schematic representation of the system plant given in fig 2 the problem may be formulated as follows i given the control volume sketched in the figure and ii considering that both the atmosphere and soil around the system are and remain in a uniform thermodynamic state defined by temperature t0 pressure p0 and a set of concentrations c0j for j 1 to j well identified components iii derive the exergy budget of the system and calculate its total exδ and the conversion efficiency of the system plant 3 1 mass balance in this paper mass flowrates are expressed for convenience in kg s trees acquire mass by four mechanisms 1 water absorption by the roots rather than attempting to calculate the direct absorption on the roots surface the model assumes that water diffuses from the external soil at constant concentration c0 w to the soil internal to the control volume at cwr the net water inflow from ground mwg can be computed based on in vivo experiments τg being the portion of time in which absorption is active i e the plant is actively absorbing nutrients and ψr is a model factor that accounts

they examined this secondary water acquisition strategy is widespread across species and is not limited to those exposed to a constant humid wind water uptake increases foliar hydration and it does not depend on the availability of primary soil water water penetrates through the cuticle slatyer 2018 and therefore the model assumes that water diffuses from external fog at constant concentration

in calculating the energy balance of a leaf or a plant gond et al 1999 hargreaves and samani 1985 marques et al 1997 stankova et al 2016 vitale et al 2003 is the fact that this phenomenon must be split into two terms the first etr expresses the enthalpy of the liquid water that transpires hw and the second evap represents the cooling caused by the subtraction of a portion of the enthalpy of evaporation from the leaves to the air while there is no problem in quantifying the first term the second one poses some problems because it consists in a combination of convection and evaporation cooling and therefore includes both the enthalpy of evaporation hfg and a convective contribution that is very difficult to calculate in the model we adopted a more standard formulation james et al

called pumping term the sap is indeed pumped from the roots to the leaves by a combination of capillary effects osmotic pressure cohesion tension effects and probably some turgor induced action but within the frame of the present analysis we are only interested in the amount of power exchanged through the boundaries of the control volume so that the plant must draw this pumping energy from its internal dynamics 3 3 exergy budget exergy does not respect a conservation law and a portion of it is in fact destroyed in every real process it is more correct to speak of an exergy budget instead of a balance for convenience it is though useful to write a virtual algebraic balance by introducing a fictitious flux equal to the exergy destruction rate keeping in mind that this term is not a physically measurable quantity but is indeed the unknown in the exergy budget equation e x i n e x o u t e x δ since the mass and energy flowrates can be derived from their respective balance equations the exergy balance leads to the calculation of the irreversible exergy destruction rate which can be shown to be proportional to the total entropy generation rate 18 e x δ e x i n e x o u t

plant conversion efficiency it is necessary to qualify the exergy fluxes as products and fuels the prescriptions of the exergy analysis method are rather intuitive tsatsaronis and winhold 1985 we define as product any exergy flux that exits the control volume and can be in principle used by external users similarly a fuel is any exergy flux that enters the control volume and is used by the system for its internal processes in the case of a living system no flow can be assumed to be a wasteful discharge because each trophic level feeds the one immediately below in a way that all raw material is continuously recycled within the food chain in this frame plant re radiation contributes to the local albedo plant evaporation contributes to the local microclimate and plant litter is

from the point of view of the system tree it may be also stated that the only product that really matters is its own growth related to the net solar irradiation impinging on the system e x s u n e x r

further new production eqs 20 and 21 demonstrate that the conversion efficiency of a tree can be expressed in terms of three sets of parameters the plant shape quantities h rt rb rc rb rr the physio chemical properties of the substances it extracts from and releases to the surroundings and a number of site dependent environmental data i τs τev t0 cws etc all these quantities are either known or can be directly measured in the field 4 validation of the model the model was applied to an isolated specimen of pinus sylvestris scots pine tables 2 and 3 report the environmental and model parameters applied in the simulation pinus sylvestris fig 3 is a conifer widely distributed throughout eurasia from 37 n to 70 3 n latitude it is a light demanding weak competitor niinemets and valladares 2006 and although the species tolerates all kinds of site conditions it shows best growth on fertile soils intermediate dgbs type ellenberg 1988 where however it is outcompeted by picea or broad leaved tree species such as fagus sylvatica notice that soil with an intermediate dgbs type is most likely associated with a balanced nutrition of trees with no soil acidification however the exact nature of the soil is neglected in this analysis it was assumed that mineral salts absorbed through the roots were k and mg augmented kaolinite dolomite and ammonium nitrate the respective exergy values were adapted from szargut et al 1988 first of all the npp growth calculated with our model was compared with some field results by krankina 2011 for a 25 m plant age 60 yrs the model results gave 510 kg yr against an experimental maximum of 534 well within the tolerance this is a very satisfactory result especially in view of the completely lumped model discussed here for the reference case age 20years h0 10 m t0 280 k pirr 400 w m2 the results of the calculation are in almost perfect agreement with the field data of peltola peltola et al 2018 and magnani magnani et al 2009 figs 5 7 report the water balance the global and solar exergy efficiency respectively it appears that the respiration and evapotranspiration are also satisfactorily predicted figs 8 and 9 report the values of absorbed o2 absorbed n2 and of the released co2 as a function of tree age these are all daily averages over the year since no daily or seasonal variation is accounted for in our model table 4 reports the results of a simulation carried out on a 20 years old specimen of pinus sylvestris height h0 10 m the average growth is 0 586 m yr the amount of litter 5 3 kg yr the energy balance is closed within 7 6 which is sufficiently accurate given the range of the total input ein 6040 w and output eout 5580 w the evapotranspiration index et0 5 05 mm d an acceptable value 6 6 the evapotranspiration index et0 is a measure of the amount of water released into the atmosphere by a certain colture which corresponds therefore to its minimum watering requirements its values vary with climate type of soil and plant type acceptable values for the pinus sylvestris in its niche lie between 4 and 6 mm day 19 the plant releases 24 3 l day of water the global exergy efficiency is ηex 0 00085 but if it is calculated with respect to the radiation balance it becomes ηnpp 0 028 the net plant production yields 3 5 10 5 kg s of new biomass with an assumed growth period of 165 days year which corresponds to 0 95kgc m2 soil yr under an projected canopy surface of 50 m2 and a projected leaf area index of 2 15 m2 leaf m2 soil β table 3 gond et al 1999 this value is similar to results measured by magnani magnani et al 2009 in pinus sylvestris trees of similar age and height i e about 0 9 kgc m2 soil yr the agreement with different field data peltola et al 2018 is also good for a tree of h0 10 6 m the new trunk radius calculated by the model table 5 is 0 1 m vs the 0 101 0 126 m measured by peltola peltola et al 2018 5 model sensitivity a sensitivity study was performed to verify the influence of environmental and structure parameters such as irradiation rate initial tree height and air temperature on the yearly growth of pinus sylvestris and on its exergy efficiency some results are shown in figs 10 15 for a mature tree 40 years h0 19 m the growth in height m y increases almost linearly with the irradiation fig 10 which is congruent with the graph of fig 4 since the proportional allocation of gross primary production to trunk branches root and leaves was maintained constant across the calculations this implies that even mature trees have an energetic interest to grow in height and crown because by so doing their solar efficiency eq 21 increases fig 7 and they can better compete for solar irradiation with respect to their neighbours in fact both the net npp and the solar efficiency eq 21 increase quadratically with the irradiation figs 11 12 the influence of the ambient temperature t0 is shown in figs 13 15 δh and npp increase with increasing t0 a higher evapotranspiration is apparently compensated by a higher water intake from the ground while ηnpp eqtn 21 reaches a peak for t0 280 k and decreases both for higher and lower t0 the latter result depends on two competing effects schär et al 2004 varone et al 2015 the decrease of the exergy of reradiation with higher t0 and the corresponding variation of the evapotranspiration with increasing t0 table 6 6 discussion and conclusions a lumped steady state model of a conifer pinus sylvestris is presented and discussed the model is based on global mass and energy balances and leads to the calculation of the exergy efficiency of the system tree the results are in satisfactory agreement with field data and their sensitivity to different environmental factors displays physically reasonable trends two different exergetic efficiencies were defined the first eq 20 represents the performance of the conversion from the total exergy inputs into plant growth while the second eq 21 is a measure of the importance of the exergy destruction with reference to the radiation reradiation budget the total conversion efficiency for the reference case age 20 years h0 10 m t0 280 k pirr 400 w m2 is about 0 00085 while the exergy destruction amounts to about 0 997 of the difference between the absorbed solar radiation and the plant reradiation the model is extremely sensitive to the evapotranspiration index et0 and this is indicative that further investigations are needed a word of caution is necessary the model is totally deterministic it considers the tree as being frozen in a steady state over the entire year and it depends on many model parameters some of which can only be adjusted only by heuristic considerations it is noteworthy that despite neglecting the real molecular scale chemo physical details of plant growth our lumped model can reproduce the most salient characters of the phenomenon application of the same model to different species may reveal asymmetries in the adaptability of certain genotypes to different environments on the more specific engineering side the model may see an immediate application in the estimate of co2 capture by plants muys 2013 walentowski et al 2013 perhaps more important from a thermodynamic point of view it leads to the calculation of the primary exergy resources invested in the generation of npp a true exergetic cost that may have many important applications in sustainability studies 
25159,the scaling exponent of the biomass density relationship of even aged plant populations often described as the slope of the self thinning line and its presumed universality has been a subject of debate for a long time comprehensive observational studies mainly in the last century yielded even shifting slopes for which until now the theoretical basis was not fully clarified with a new mechanistic individual based plant growth model the bettina ibm that considered allometric adaptation to resource supply we identified two regimes of the self thinning process i the geometrical thinning which is driven by the ground area occupied by individual plants for this the slope is controlled by the allometric relations of the plant and thus roughly fitting the 3 2 power law age dependent processes impacting the allometry e g secondary girth growth result in a deviation from the original geometrical assumptions and this may alter the slope accordingly the intercept depends on species specific allometric relations site characteristics and the competition mode ii the maximum maintainable biomass per ground area for which if reached the slope is 1 the intercept depends on resource supply light and below ground resources as derived by the logarithm of the maximum total volume per area the actual self thinning line follows the minimum of both lines and it is capped by the maximum individual plant size depending on the intercepts of i and ii the slope of the self thinning line may be controlled by i geometrical thinning ii resource limitation or a switch between both these two regimes and the shift from one to the other comply with experimental observations from the literature overall morphological plasticity explains the variability of the slope of the self thinning line when geometrical thinning is dominating keywords self thinning biomass density relationship scaling exponent individual based modelling allometric plasticity resource limitation 1 introduction 1 1 context and aim of the study the presumed universality of the scaling exponent of the biomass density relationship in even aged plant populations often described as the slope of the self thinning has bred a lasting debate among plant ecologists both empirical and model based studies have shown and explained that variability of the biomass density relations can result from different modes of competition nevertheless until now the role of adaptive behaviour of plants to both their abiotic environment and competition with neighbouring individuals remains largely unexplored this study aims at developing a new unifying theory of self thinning which in contrast to earlier theories is mechanistic at the level of individual growth patterns and allocation schemes and as well as the mode of plant interactions which are essentially ignored by yoda et al 1963 and enquist et al 1998 previous modelling approaches assumed phenomenological growth functions and failed to consider morphological plasticity as a strategy through which plants adapt to resource availability and competition the model presented here describes extensively plant morphological adaptation and thus takes into account the variability of the relationship between the biomass or the volume of individual trees in a stand and the ground surface occupied by each tree while we have considered mangrove trees as a modelling system the questions addressed herein and the answers so obtained are supposed to extend beyond mangrove ecology in the frame of this study we seek to address the following questions a a principal assumption for the geometrical explanation of the exponent of b 3 2 in eq 1 below is that plant s growth complies with an isometric scaling regarding this we examine the effect of morphological plasticity on the relationship between the tree s covered area crown or root and volume atree vtree for the growth of a single tree without competition and different salinities i e different water availabilities how does competition alter that relationship b how is the relationship described in a above linked to the slope of the self thinning line which other factors are of significant impact c most importantly can we interpret parameters defining the course of the self thinning line 1 2 the slope of the self thinning line self thinning is a key process in plant ecology that describes how the relationship between individual plant size and the number of all plants in a given area stand density mirrors the temporal development of a population this relationship is usually defined by a scaling slope reineke 1933 formulated an empirical scaling law relating the stand density to the 1 605 power of the quadratic mean stem diameter this concept had a huge impact on forest science based on geometric considerations yoda et al 1963 developed the 3 2 power law for even aged plant populations 1 m n b with m the average biomass n as the stand density and an exponent b fixed at 3 2 their main assumption is that the plant s growth process complies with isometric scaling i e the relationship between biomass plant volume m and the area a occupied by a tree is constantly m a 3 2 with emphasis on theoretical considerations for the fractal like nature of resource distribution enquist et al 1998 postulate an exponent of b 4 3 and this earned both acceptance and rejection e g kozlowski and konarzewski 2004 nevertheless there exists a longer history of discussion and criticism on the universality of fixed slope values for self thinning at all empirical evidence shows again and again that the slope of the self thinning line can vary considerably as weller 1987 suggests the variance of slopes may provide a valuable measure of the ecological differences among species and plants hutchings and budd 1981 lonsdale and watkinson 1982 and others equally suggest that a switch to a slope of b 1 can result when a maximum standing crop per area unit is reached as a systematic example wang et al 2013 shows with datasets of nine forest stands along an aridity gradient in china a dependence of the self thinning slope on water availability values ranged from b 1 74 for humid to b 0 95 for arid areas pointing towards an additional plastic response of the individual trees a decrease of the shoot height crown radius relationship along a gradient of benign to dry conditions was observed in addition an interesting history exists that challenge even a strict linearity of the logarithmic relationship after eq 1 and thus a constant b 2 l n m a b l n n lonsdale 1990 presented a summary of reasons for non linearity or shifts in either slope or intercept in eq 2 similarly zeide 1987 shows with long term stand data and yield tables that linearity does not necessarily apply in all cases further he stated that the view the power law were basically accurate but might not be precise would be convincing if the deviations were random and if slopes remained constant during the development of closed stands unlike the fixed value of 3 2 the actual slopes convey valuable information about species and habitats that should not be cast away thus the law is neither precise nor accurate zeide 2010 points at the influence of allometric relations and age he assumed crown size as the key measure for self thinning and thus preferred the stem diameter rather than the volume as a predictor for stand density consequently his discussion on self thinning models were based on stem diameter same as reineke 1933 and nilson 2004 further zeide 2010 has considered internal factors such as senescence and decreasing tolerance to the deficiency of light as a reason for a not strictly linear shape of the self thinning line lin et al 2013 used a modelling approach based on the metabolic scaling theory west et al 1997 1999 and the zone of influence zoi approach weiner et al 2001 to examine the influence of the competition mode on the self thinning line generally above ground competition i e competition for light is assumed to be asymmetric i e the bigger competitor is getting a significantly higher proportion of resources below ground processes are believed to be subject to symmetric competition i e resources are shared more equally even when the model did not handle allometric relations between plant measures but relied on only a biomass zoi size relationship lin et al 2013 found a gradient of slopes covering an approximate range of 1 5 for complete asymmetric competition to 1 1 for complete symmetric competition with the general assumption of predominantly symmetric below ground and asymmetric above ground competition the result fits qualitatively the empirical observations of shallower slopes with arid conditions 1 3 consideration of above and below ground processes and morphological adaptation of plants stoll et al 2002 found in field experiments with transgenic arabidopsis an interaction of morphological plasticity and the mode of competition it is widely accepted that morphological plasticity is very related to resource availability e g gratani 2014 grams and andersen 2007 bloor and grubb 2004 maseda and fernández 2015 as noted above in wang et al 2013 the change of the slope of the self thinning line with increasing aridity went hand in hand with a change in morphology of the plants nevertheless some empirical studies on self thinning show much shallower slopes especially under dry climatic conditions e g zhang et al 2011 even so some authors e g li et al 2013 suppose an influence of the mode of competition on the slope of the self thinning line lin et al 2014 carried out green house experiments with different fertilisation levels of seedlings of the silver birch betula pendula they found qualitatively similar patterns of both biomass allocation and slopes of the self thinning line allocation of biomass into roots was increased and the slopes of the self thinning lines were shallower with less fertilisation additionally lin et al 2014 expanded the model from lin et al 2013 to a two layer model distinguishing between above and below ground biomass they found with increasing below ground resource limitation an increased proportion of biomass allocated below ground further they investigated the influence of different assumptions regarding symmetry or asymmetry of competition unlimited below ground resources led to the slopes of the self thinning line dominated by the above ground competition mode and vice versa a similar modelling study was carried out by zhang et al 2017 incorporating below ground facilitation counteracting below ground resource limitation both approaches generally explain the observed patterns of below ground resource limitation leading to shallower slopes of the self thinning line however due to the phenomenological description of the individual plants there are some limitations of these approaches i the only size measures are above and below ground biomass there is no allometric adaptation beyond biomass distribution to these two components ii the growth rate is in the first place a function of biomass abiotic resource limitation is a constant factor independent from competition effects or plant size iii the sizes of the zois are related to only the biomass of the respective compartment in this article we propose a more detailed and mechanistic consideration of the interrelation between allometry resource uptake and competition for instance concerning above ground biomass the potential amount of intercepted light will depend on the horizontal extension i e the crown diameter the competitiveness rather depends on tree height but on the other hand an increased tree height impedes water uptake by an elongated flow path between roots and leaves with the bettina approach for mangrove trees peters et al 2014 we have a suitable tool to explore the self thinning process taking into account the most important tree measures like root stem and crown diameter and their specific role in resource uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model the bettina model peters et al 2014 is designed for describing the morphological plasticity of mangrove plants due to resource light and water availability depending on salinity and parametrised for the mangrove species avicennia germinans we extended this single tree model to a two layer ibm on that basis the bettina ibm applied in this study essentially integrates the mechanistically defined biomass allocation and interactions among plants to achieve a stand model that overcomes the mentioned limitations of previous models the model code is written in netlogo wilensky 1999 the single tree model bettina was introduced and described in peters et al 2014 all modifications made to this model in order to achieve the bettina ibm are described in appendix a see supplementary material mainly the model was expanded by the zoi approach considering both above and below ground processes a complete odd protocol describing the model can be found in appendix b for a better understanding the basic assumptions of the model single plant without competition as comprehensively introduced in peters et al 2014 can be summarised as follows 1 intercepted light above ground and water below ground resource are used in a constant proportion 2 light interception is proportional to crown area 3 water uptake is controlled by a potential gradient and flow resistances 4 the flow resistances are determined by allometric measures flow path and flow cross section 5 new biomass is allocated to increase allometric measures in a way to improve uptake of the limiting resource 6 height growth is promoted if the crown radius is bigger than the root radius in this case competition predominately for light is expected 7 maintenance costs are proportional to the total volume of the tree 8 mortality is defined by a death threshold if growth falls below a certain proportion of the tree volume the individual dies in 3 the potential gradient is the gradient of water potential between leaves and soil matrix the leaf water potential is assumed to be constant for a certain species indeed there exist in a variety of estimated minimum values e g 6 5 mpa in walter and breckle 2004 for avicennia or 3 0 mpa for oak in epron and dreyer 1993 the soil water potential is the sum of matric and osmotic potential the matric potential is depending on soil moisture and can decrease in magnitudes within a rainfall event in contrast the osmotic potential is proportional to salinity and with this the assumption of being constant in time is much more reasonable in mangroves the osmotic potential is the dominating factor and we assume the matric potential being 0 saturated soil matrix a higher salinity is equivalent to a smaller potential gradient with this high salinities conform to permanent drought conditions and low salinities to a sufficient water supply the model reproduces observed allometric patterns depending on size and different salinities as can also be seen in fig 1 in case of a good access to water low salinities the crown may get bigger than the root zone assumptions 1 2 and 5 with this height growth is promoted 6 and trees at lower salinities conforms to a better below ground resource supply grow taller in contrast for high salinities the plant will predominantly allocate the biomass to decrease the flow resistances 1 3 and 5 by increasing the flow cross sections that is the tree will grow in girth and will extend the root radius to maximise the fine root surface extremely high salinities lead to a much bigger root radius than crown radius and stem height growth is reduced to almost zero with this the model trees get a shrubby shape without a conspicuous stem the below ground above ground ratio gets much bigger under increasingly saline conditions this result aligns with known empirical observations see also appendix c fig 2 shows increasing resource uptake and maintenance costs as a consequence of assumption 7 for a single tree in our mechanistic model the gap between the lines defines the resources available for biomass growth for bigger trees the growth slows down and the point where resource uptake and maintenance equilibrate defines the maximum size of a tree under given environmental conditions fig 1a depending on the death threshold 8 the tree gets only close to that point this model behaviour is supported by the argumentation of zeide 2010 about age related processes leading to decreased shade tolerance in summary allometric relations in the current model depend on both the size of the tree and the resource availability the resource availability depends on the allometric measures abiotic environment and competition total maximum biomass is depending on the available resources for the maintenance of the biomass and with this emerging from the given environmental conditions the radii rroot and rcrown are assumed to be the radii of below and above ground zoi respectively below ground competition is assumed to be completely symmetric that is from an area in the root zone overlapped by root zones of ncomp competitors the plant gets only a share of 1 n c o m p 1 of the water it would get without competitors above ground competition is in the first place completely asymmetric i e in areas of overlapping crowns the tallest tree gets everything in contrast to the original zoi approach depending on the gaps in the canopy layer in the environment of a tree shaded crown parts can intercept diffuse radiation as a further modification from the classical asymmetric competition concept above ground competition strength is not determined by the radius of the zoi but rather depends on the height of the crown as the allometry of the trees may differ with diverse neighbourhood situations in space and time a tree with a smaller crown radius could possibly grow taller than its neighbour the considered allometric measures of crown and root radius and stem height and diameter allow for both an estimation of the volume related to biomass and horizontal extension of a tree marked by its zoi both above and below ground above and below ground processes act simultaneously the growth of allometric measures in the first place improves resource uptake but by increasing the flow length between roots and leaves there may occur a contrary effect in comparison to former approaches i above ground biomass increase girth growth may promote the availability of below ground resources water uptake and ii it is possible to investigate in a greater resolution the interaction among trees in a stand with respect to the effect of allometry and individual adaptation on the biotic neighbourhood 2 2 analysis we run the model with a single tree and for stands with initial densities of 2715 ha 1 4000 individuals on 601 1201 patches of 1 72 m2 we assumed salinities of 10 30 50 and 60 ppt which corresponds to a range of increasing aridity for comparison sea water salinity of some 35 ppt corresponds to an osmotic potential of approximately 2 5 mpa ball 1988 whereas the permanent wilting point for plants is defined as a soil matric potential of only 1 5 mpa every subsequent analysis was carried out with r r core team 2016 to check the extent to which an average model tree complies with the assumption of isotropic growth we firstly related the tree volume vtree to the space occupied by a tree atree appropriated to the maximum of the crown area a c r o w n π r c r o w n 2 and root area a r o o t π r r o o t 2 this was done for single trees without competition 3a and the averages of all living trees in the stand during the self thinning process 3b which accounts for the influence of competition on this relationship in the case of an approximate isotropy the values should fit the relationship 3a l n v t r e e k a l l o m 3 2 l n a t r e e 3b ln v t r e e k a l l o m 3 2 l n a t r

r e e n 1 with e k p as an average number of individuals overlapping with a point on the ground we get a t r e e n e k p 4 ln a t r e e k p l n n for instance if the trees would fit the area perfectly without gaps or overlapping there would be e k p 1 and thus kp 0 with 3b and 4 the parameters of the self thinning line 5 ln v t r e e k b l n n should be b 3 2 6 k k a l l o m 3 2 k p to relate variation of these parameters to the development of the entire stand the total stand volume m v tree was mapped and related to tree density n for a further discussion of the assumed isotropy in eq 3a we relate the allocation of the growth to the expected slope of 3 2 in eq 3a the crown growth is expressed as for derivation see appendix a 7 d v c r o w n 2 π h c r o w n r c r o w n r s t e m 2 d r

growth decreases the slope in eq 3a analogously this could be shown for root growth height and girth are not related to the area covered by a plant and thus preferred growth of these measures increases the slope in 3a 3 results 3 1 allometry to give an impression on how the model trees develop their allometric relations depending on their size and individual resource availability fig 3 exemplifies the temporal course of the stem diameter height relation for a salinity of 30 ppt the dotted line marks the relation for a tree without competing neighbours average trees exposed to absolute competition for light develop bigger crowns and taller stems this leads to a shifted line towards in average taller trees with same stem diameters the dots and crosses show the dimensions of trees at the moment of their death by lack of light or water respectively herein above ground asymmetric light related competition dominates thus most of the trees die by lacking light the big trees may die from drought stress as the axial flow resistance flow between fine roots and leaves is gaining increasing importance as shown in peters et al 2014 the tree s effort in decreasing this resistance leads to an enhanced stem diameter growth known as secondary girth growth in forestry this is reflected in the general shape of the diameter height relation at the stage a tree is at approximately maximum height water limitation by competing neighbours leads easily to water shortage that cannot be compensated by further stem diameter or root growth that is why the biggest trees predominantly die of limiting water availability fig 4 shows the relation between the logarithms of the area covered by a tree and its volume i e the bold line single tree eq 3a and the thin line average tree with competition eq 3b if this relation would be linear with a slope of 3 2 i e parallel to the background stripes all dimensions of the tree would increase proportionally isotropic scaling this would fit the assumption underlying the slope of 3 2 of the self thinning line small trees are characterised by shallower slopes as they grow mainly in root and crown diameter both root and crown growth are composed of an increment of biomass 3 dimensional proportional to the covered area for leaves and fine roots growth increases extend only in two dimensions a c r o w n in eq 8 and an increment proportional to only the radius of either root or crown branch and cable root length 1 dimensional growth a c r o w n 1 2 in eq 8 with eq 10 crown growth decreases the slope of the relation in fig 4 the augmented girth growth of bigger trees leads to steeper slopes in fig 4 compared to a good water supply 10 ppt at 60 ppt equivalent to more arid conditions the line got a similar slope but a smaller intercept this is because trees covering the same space got smaller stems at 60 ppt and thus less biomass than with better access to water 10 ppt the thin lines in fig 4 show the relationship for average living trees in the stand the deviation from the single tree line is due to competition if trees compete for either light or water growth of the area increasing measures crown or root diameter rcrown or rroot are promoted trees of highest fitness those which are less affected by competition are closer to the shape of a single tree when competition pressure decreases following the death of competitors trees will promote growth of other components these two effects lead to a reduction of the difference between the lines of single and stand trees of bigger volumes 3 2 self thinning fig 5 shows the modelled self thinning lines for the different salinities with eq 3b the thin lines in fig 5 mark ln ā from fig 4 for the corresponding tree volumes on the y axis in the upper pictures water supply is adequate low salinities and competition for light is predominating the gap between the lines 3 2 kp from eq 6 is small i e neighbouring plants overlap less than with higher salinities below both lines are almost parallel and the allometry induced change in slopes is mirrored in the self thinning line for higher salinities the gap of the lines is much bigger i e more overlapping but there is little similarity between the lines the total tree volume per hectare m of the stand is shown below fig 5 left y axis it can be seen that different sections of the self thinning line correspond to different sections of this graph m is increasing with decreasing tree density n up to a maximum level of approx mmax 750 m3 ha 1 for salinities up to 50 ppt and slightly below for 60 ppt when the total tree volume remains at this maximum level the slope of the self thinning line equals 1 with 11 v t r e e n m for the section with a constant m mmax the slope of the self thinning line is described with 12 ln v t r e e ln m m a x l n n interpreting this maximum total stand volume mmax as the maximum that can be maintained per ground unit we can deduce for the self thinning line that the slope is 1 and the intercept is the logarithm of the maximum volume maintained by ground unit ln mmax if the single trees reach their size limit and cannot grow further mortality disentangles from the competition and the slope of the self thinning line is 0 13 ln v t r e e ln v t r e e m a x 0 l n n 4 discussion 4 1 allometry the logarithmic relationship between the ground area covered by a tree and the tree s volume approximately fits the 3 2 slope there is a systematic deviation from linearity shallower slopes at the beginning when the tree is growing predominately in surface claiming root and crown radius are followed by steeper slopes for older trees when new biomass is mainly allocated into stem diameter increase this effect is even promoted by competition the intercept of an assumed average linear relation depends on the specific allometry the horizontal extension of a tree with the same volume may vary with the species identity available solar radiation as defined by the latitude available water and or rooting depths soil properties etc hence it is difficult to find a general rule regarding this intercept 4 2 self thinning we suggest three main processes fig 6 framing the shape of the self thinning line it should be noted that we omit the sometimes referred vertical course determined by the initial density in all analyses presented in this study i the allometry of the single trees determines the slope of geometric thinning the slope is related to the relationship between the area covered by a tree and its volume nevertheless as tree growth is not entirely isotropic during its lifetime e g secondary girth growth the relation is only approximately linear at the initial stage and becomes slightly steeper for bigger trees the intercept k aggregates species and site specific properties kallom individual allometry abiotic factors and the overlapping area of neighbouring trees 3 2 kp as symmetric competition promotes coexistence of neighbours the packing density of the trees may be bigger and predominate symmetric competition may lead to higher intercepts with geometric thinning the stand biomass is increasing with stand age ii the available resources are completely used and the maximum biomass per area is reached the slope of the self thinning line is 1 and the intercept is fixed by the logarithm of the maximum supported biomass per ground area with this a better resource supply would increase the intercept the stand biomass remains constant iii the upper limit is defined by the maximum plant size the slope is 0 and the intercept equals the logarithm of the maximal single tree volume the stand biomass is decreasing with the death of single trees according to this the self thinning line can be described with 16 l n v t r e e m i n k a l l o m 3 2 k p l n m m a x l n v t r e e m a x 3 2 1 0 l n n the self thinning line is defined by the minimum of these three relationships and may be shaped as illustrated in fig 6 bottom right as the assumption of an even aged stand without rejuvenation in natural stands is hardly given especially stage iii with declining total stand biomass can hardly be detected in field data nevertheless the maximum tree size caps the range of the self thinning line primarily the intercept of the three possible lines defines where the lines intersect and thus which slope is estimated to predict the self thinning line as indicated in eq 16 four parameters are needed table 1 future field and greenhouse experiments or reanalysis of empirical data should focus on estimating these parameters for instance the allometric constant kallom or the maximum plant volume vmax could be estimated for a wide range of species with available standard allometric data the other two parameters would require measurements from even aged forest stands the estimation of maximum maintainable biomass mmax may be challenging as it covers both above and below ground biomass and further requires that self thinning must already follow the exponent of b 1 altogether empirical evidence supports these findings the observed correlation between competition mode and slope of the self thinning line e g li et al 2013 lin et al 2013 can be attributed to the different intercepts of stages i and ii arid sites which are limited by below ground water supply have a lower maintainable maximum biomass per ground unit and thus the corresponding line ii has a small intercept further predominate symmetric below ground competition returns a higher intercept for the relationship i thus the self thinning process is constrained by the maximum biomass per ground area and slopes of 1 are detected in sites with sufficient resource supply and supposed light limitation geometric thinning and allometry influenced slopes of 3 2 are observed with the model runs combinations of these modes could be identified fig 5 hutchings and budd 1981 described a transition in woody stands from 3 2 to 1 with the same explanation of a reached carrying capacity of the stand further there is a remarkable match with the findings of lonsdale and watkinson 1982 they grew monocultures of english ryegrass lolium perenne with different densities and shade regimes i e restricting above ground resources for the unshaded plants they found slopes of the self thinning line of the shoot weight ranging between 1 43 and 1 46 including the root weight altered the slope to 1 26 this may indicate that the driving process was geometric thinning of the shoot parts shading regimes up to 77 led to slopes between 1 49 and 1 52 shoots only for 83 shading they estimated a slope of 1 05 for the whole plant biomass intercept k 2 51 on a common logarithmic scale they conclude that the maximum standing crop for these shade conditions was reached and suggested a theoretical slope of 1 indeed they estimated a constant final yield of about 200 gm 2 interpreting these results in the sense of the conclusions of this article we would predict the intercept of the self thinning line of k 2 30 with a slope of 1 within the approximate range of densities from 105 to 103 m 2 we would predict corresponding average plant weights of 0 0020 0 20 g compared to 0 0018 0 23 g with the original parameters further populations sown at very high densities underwent an initial period of thinning along a slope of minus 3 2 followed by a switch to a slope of minus 1 beside the fact that the authors restricted above ground resources the experiments completely confirm the findings of the modelling approach presented in this study for the stages ii and iii the identification of slope and intercept is pretty clear for the geometric thinning it could be shown that the self thinning line is almost parallel to the relation between the reciprocal area of covered ground surface and the average tree volume the horizontal shift has been discussed and mainly attributed to the packing density for the low salinities in fig 5 the self thinning line is slightly shallower than the respective relation between the tree s area and volume this implies that the density is decreasing faster the mortality is slightly higher than expected an explanation can be seen in fig 2 the resource uptake by living trees cannot fall below the maintenance costs but competition will decrease resource uptake to lower values than obtained for resource uptake without competition for bigger trees this span decreases that is the tolerance of the plants against competition decreases with age this may accelerate the self thinning process nevertheless the dispersion of measured data might avoid the detection of a change in the slope of the self thinning line in field data further pretzsch 2006 points at a possible bias by an accumulation of dead inner xylem for woody plants with this estimated stem volumes would even grow more than determined by the model and the slopes may fall significantly below 3 2 e g in wang et al 2013 for humid forest stands in china or pretzsch 2006 for the common oak stands in western germany with this modelling approach we could advance in exploring the processes of self thinning and its relationship with allometric properties of plants we overcome some limitations of the phenomenological description of the individual plants in conventional models namely i extending allometric descriptions beyond a simple distinction between above and below ground biomass ii estimating the current growth mechanistically without determining a fixed empirical maximum plant size and iii connecting the parameters of the zoi concept to explicit allometric measures the model results explain and reproduce experimentally found patterns and elucidate the parameters of the self thinning lines to our knowledge and for the first time the observed regime changes leading to a deviation in the slope of the self thinning line could be modelled authors

25159,the scaling exponent of the biomass density relationship of even aged plant populations often described as the slope of the self thinning line and its presumed universality has been a subject of debate for a long time comprehensive observational studies mainly in the last century yielded even shifting slopes for which until now the theoretical basis was not fully clarified with a new mechanistic individual based plant growth model the bettina ibm that considered allometric adaptation to resource supply we identified two regimes of the self thinning process i the geometrical thinning which is driven by the ground area occupied by individual plants for this the slope is controlled by the allometric relations of the plant and thus roughly fitting the 3 2 power law age dependent processes impacting the allometry e g secondary girth growth result in a deviation from the original geometrical assumptions and this may alter the slope accordingly the intercept depends on species specific allometric relations site characteristics and the competition mode ii the maximum maintainable biomass per ground area for which if reached the slope is 1 the intercept depends on resource supply light and below ground resources as derived by the logarithm of the maximum total volume per area the actual self thinning line follows the minimum of both lines and it is capped by the maximum individual plant size depending on the intercepts of i and ii the slope of the self thinning line may be controlled by i geometrical thinning ii resource limitation or a switch between both these two regimes and the shift from one to the other comply with experimental observations from the literature overall morphological plasticity explains the variability of the slope of the self thinning line when geometrical thinning is dominating keywords self thinning biomass density relationship scaling exponent individual based modelling allometric plasticity resource limitation 1 introduction 1 1 context and aim of the study the presumed universality of the scaling exponent of the biomass density relationship in even aged plant populations often described as the slope of the self thinning has bred a lasting debate among plant ecologists both empirical and model based studies have shown and explained that variability of the biomass density relations can result from different modes of competition nevertheless until now the role of adaptive behaviour of plants to both their abiotic environment and competition with neighbouring individuals remains largely unexplored this study aims at developing a new unifying theory of self thinning which in contrast to earlier theories is mechanistic at the level of individual growth patterns and allocation schemes and as well as the mode of plant interactions which are essentially ignored by yoda et al 1963 and enquist et al 1998 previous modelling approaches assumed phenomenological growth functions and failed to consider morphological plasticity as a strategy through which plants adapt to resource availability and competition the model presented here describes extensively plant morphological adaptation and thus takes into account the variability of the relationship between the biomass or the volume of individual trees in a stand and the ground surface occupied by each tree while we have considered mangrove trees as a modelling system the questions addressed herein and the answers so obtained are supposed to extend beyond mangrove ecology in the frame of this study we seek to address the following questions a a principal assumption for the geometrical explanation of the exponent of b 3 2 in eq 1 below is that plant s growth complies with an isometric scaling regarding this we examine the effect of morphological plasticity on the relationship between the tree s covered area crown or root and volume atree vtree for the growth of a single tree without competition and different salinities i e different water availabilities how does competition alter that relationship b how is the relationship described in a above linked to the slope of the self thinning line which other factors are of significant impact c most importantly can we interpret parameters defining the course of the self thinning line 1 2 the slope of the self thinning line self thinning is a key process in plant ecology that describes how the relationship between individual plant size and the number of all plants in a given area stand density mirrors the temporal development of a population this relationship is usually defined by a scaling slope reineke 1933 formulated an empirical scaling law relating the stand density to the 1 605 power of the quadratic mean stem diameter this concept had a huge impact on forest science based on geometric considerations yoda et al 1963 developed the 3 2 power law for even aged plant populations 1 m n b with m the average biomass n as the stand density and an exponent b fixed at 3 2 their main assumption is that the plant s growth process complies with isometric scaling i e the relationship between biomass plant volume m and the area a occupied by a tree is constantly m a 3 2 with emphasis on theoretical considerations for the fractal like nature of resource distribution enquist et al 1998 postulate an exponent of b 4 3 and this earned both acceptance and rejection e g kozlowski and konarzewski 2004 nevertheless there exists a longer history of discussion and criticism on the universality of fixed slope values for self thinning at all empirical evidence shows again and again that the slope of the self thinning line can vary considerably as weller 1987 suggests the variance of slopes may provide a valuable measure of the ecological differences among species and plants hutchings and budd 1981 lonsdale and watkinson 1982 and others equally suggest that a switch to a slope of b 1 can result when a maximum standing crop per area unit is reached as a systematic example wang et al 2013 shows with datasets of nine forest stands along an aridity gradient in china a dependence of the self thinning slope on water availability values ranged from b 1 74 for humid to b 0 95 for arid areas pointing towards an additional plastic response of the individual trees a decrease of the shoot height crown radius relationship along a gradient of benign to dry conditions was observed in addition an interesting history exists that challenge even a strict linearity of the logarithmic relationship after eq 1 and thus a constant b 2 l n m a b l n n lonsdale 1990 presented a summary of reasons for non linearity or shifts in either slope or intercept in eq 2 similarly zeide 1987 shows with long term stand data and yield tables that linearity does not necessarily apply in all cases further he stated that the view the power law were basically accurate but might not be precise would be convincing if the deviations were random and if slopes remained constant during the development of closed stands unlike the fixed value of 3 2 the actual slopes convey valuable information about species and habitats that should not be cast away thus the law is neither precise nor accurate zeide 2010 points at the influence of allometric relations and age he assumed crown size as the key measure for self thinning and thus preferred the stem diameter rather than the volume as a predictor for stand density consequently his discussion on self thinning models were based on stem diameter same as reineke 1933 and nilson 2004 further zeide 2010 has considered internal factors such as senescence and decreasing tolerance to the deficiency of light as a reason for a not strictly linear shape of the self thinning line lin et al 2013 used a modelling approach based on the metabolic scaling theory west et al 1997 1999 and the zone of influence zoi approach weiner et al 2001 to examine the influence of the competition mode on the self thinning line generally above ground competition i e competition for light is assumed to be asymmetric i e the bigger competitor is getting a significantly higher proportion of resources below ground processes are believed to be subject to symmetric competition i e resources are shared more equally even when the model did not handle allometric relations between plant measures but relied on only a biomass zoi size relationship lin et al 2013 found a gradient of slopes covering an approximate range of 1 5 for complete asymmetric competition to 1 1 for complete symmetric competition with the general assumption of predominantly symmetric below ground and asymmetric above ground competition the result fits qualitatively the empirical observations of shallower slopes with arid conditions 1 3 consideration of above and below ground processes and morphological adaptation of plants stoll et al 2002 found in field experiments with transgenic arabidopsis an interaction of morphological plasticity and the mode of competition it is widely accepted that morphological plasticity is very related to resource availability e g gratani 2014 grams and andersen 2007 bloor and grubb 2004 maseda and fernández 2015 as noted above in wang et al 2013 the change of the slope of the self thinning line with increasing aridity went hand in hand with a change in morphology of the plants nevertheless some empirical studies on self thinning show much shallower slopes especially under dry climatic conditions e g zhang et al 2011 even so some authors e g li et al 2013 suppose an influence of the mode of competition on the slope of the self thinning line lin et al 2014 carried out green house experiments with different fertilisation levels of seedlings of the silver birch betula pendula they found qualitatively similar patterns of both biomass allocation and slopes of the self thinning line allocation of biomass into roots was increased and the slopes of the self thinning lines were shallower with less fertilisation additionally lin et al 2014 expanded the model from lin et al 2013 to a two layer model distinguishing between above and below ground biomass they found with increasing below ground resource limitation an increased proportion of biomass allocated below ground further they investigated the influence of different assumptions regarding symmetry or asymmetry of competition unlimited below ground resources led to the slopes of the self thinning line dominated by the above ground competition mode and vice versa a similar modelling study was carried out by zhang et al 2017 incorporating below ground facilitation counteracting below ground resource limitation both approaches generally explain the observed patterns of below ground resource limitation leading to shallower slopes of the self thinning line however due to the phenomenological description of the individual plants there are some limitations of these approaches i the only size measures are above and below ground biomass there is no allometric adaptation beyond biomass distribution to these two components ii the growth rate is in the first place a function of biomass abiotic resource limitation is a constant factor independent from competition effects or plant size iii the sizes of the zois are related to only the biomass of the respective compartment in this article we propose a more detailed and mechanistic consideration of the interrelation between allometry resource uptake and competition for instance concerning above ground biomass the potential amount of intercepted light will depend on the horizontal extension i e the crown diameter the competitiveness rather depends on tree height but on the other hand an increased tree height impedes water uptake by an elongated flow path between roots and leaves with the bettina approach for mangrove trees peters et al 2014 we have a suitable tool to explore the self thinning process taking into account the most important tree measures like root stem and crown diameter and their specific role in resource uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 the model the bettina model peters et al 2014 is designed for describing the morphological plasticity of mangrove plants due to resource light and water availability depending on salinity and parametrised for the mangrove species avicennia germinans we extended this single tree model to a two layer ibm on that basis the bettina ibm applied in this study essentially integrates the mechanistically defined biomass allocation and interactions among plants to achieve a stand model that overcomes the mentioned limitations of previous models the model code is written in netlogo wilensky 1999 the single tree model bettina was introduced and described in peters et al 2014 all modifications made to this model in order to achieve the bettina ibm are described in appendix a see supplementary material mainly the model was expanded by the zoi approach considering both above and below ground processes a complete odd protocol describing the model can be found in appendix b for a better understanding the basic assumptions of the model single plant without competition as comprehensively introduced in peters et al 2014 can be summarised as follows 1 intercepted light above ground and water below ground resource are used in a constant proportion 2 light interception is proportional to crown area 3 water uptake is controlled by a potential gradient and flow resistances 4 the flow resistances are determined by allometric measures flow path and flow cross section 5 new biomass is allocated to increase allometric measures in a way to improve uptake of the limiting resource 6 height growth is promoted if the crown radius is bigger than the root radius in this case competition predominately for light is expected 7 maintenance costs are proportional to the total volume of the tree 8 mortality is defined by a death threshold if growth falls below a certain proportion of the tree volume the individual dies in 3 the potential gradient is the gradient of water potential between leaves and soil matrix the leaf water potential is assumed to be constant for a certain species indeed there exist in a variety of estimated minimum values e g 6 5 mpa in walter and breckle 2004 for avicennia or 3 0 mpa for oak in epron and dreyer 1993 the soil water potential is the sum of matric and osmotic potential the matric potential is depending on soil moisture and can decrease in magnitudes within a rainfall event in contrast the osmotic potential is proportional to salinity and with this the assumption of being constant in time is much more reasonable in mangroves the osmotic potential is the dominating factor and we assume the matric potential being 0 saturated soil matrix a higher salinity is equivalent to a smaller potential gradient with this high salinities conform to permanent drought conditions and low salinities to a sufficient water supply the model reproduces observed allometric patterns depending on size and different salinities as can also be seen in fig 1 in case of a good access to water low salinities the crown may get bigger than the root zone assumptions 1 2 and 5 with this height growth is promoted 6 and trees at lower salinities conforms to a better below ground resource supply grow taller in contrast for high salinities the plant will predominantly allocate the biomass to decrease the flow resistances 1 3 and 5 by increasing the flow cross sections that is the tree will grow in girth and will extend the root radius to maximise the fine root surface extremely high salinities lead to a much bigger root radius than crown radius and stem height growth is reduced to almost zero with this the model trees get a shrubby shape without a conspicuous stem the below ground above ground ratio gets much bigger under increasingly saline conditions this result aligns with known empirical observations see also appendix c fig 2 shows increasing resource uptake and maintenance costs as a consequence of assumption 7 for a single tree in our mechanistic model the gap between the lines defines the resources available for biomass growth for bigger trees the growth slows down and the point where resource uptake and maintenance equilibrate defines the maximum size of a tree under given environmental conditions fig 1a depending on the death threshold 8 the tree gets only close to that point this model behaviour is supported by the argumentation of zeide 2010 about age related processes leading to decreased shade tolerance in summary allometric relations in the current model depend on both the size of the tree and the resource availability the resource availability depends on the allometric measures abiotic environment and competition total maximum biomass is depending on the available resources for the maintenance of the biomass and with this emerging from the given environmental conditions the radii rroot and rcrown are assumed to be the radii of below and above ground zoi respectively below ground competition is assumed to be completely symmetric that is from an area in the root zone overlapped by root zones of ncomp competitors the plant gets only a share of 1 n c o m p 1 of the water it would get without competitors above ground competition is in the first place completely asymmetric i e in areas of overlapping crowns the tallest tree gets everything in contrast to the original zoi approach depending on the gaps in the canopy layer in the environment of a tree shaded crown parts can intercept diffuse radiation as a further modification from the classical asymmetric competition concept above ground competition strength is not determined by the radius of the zoi but rather depends on the height of the crown as the allometry of the trees may differ with diverse neighbourhood situations in space and time a tree with a smaller crown radius could possibly grow taller than its neighbour the considered allometric measures of crown and root radius and stem height and diameter allow for both an estimation of the volume related to biomass and horizontal extension of a tree marked by its zoi both above and below ground above and below ground processes act simultaneously the growth of allometric measures in the first place improves resource uptake but by increasing the flow length between roots and leaves there may occur a contrary effect in comparison to former approaches i above ground biomass increase girth growth may promote the availability of below ground resources water uptake and ii it is possible to investigate in a greater resolution the interaction among trees in a stand with respect to the effect of allometry and individual adaptation on the biotic neighbourhood 2 2 analysis we run the model with a single tree and for stands with initial densities of 2715 ha 1 4000 individuals on 601 1201 patches of 1 72 m2 we assumed salinities of 10 30 50 and 60 ppt which corresponds to a range of increasing aridity for comparison sea water salinity of some 35 ppt corresponds to an osmotic potential of approximately 2 5 mpa ball 1988 whereas the permanent wilting point for plants is defined as a soil matric potential of only 1 5 mpa every subsequent analysis was carried out with r r core team 2016 to check the extent to which an average model tree complies with the assumption of isotropic growth we firstly related the tree volume vtree to the space occupied by a tree atree appropriated to the maximum of the crown area a c r o w n π r c r o w n 2 and root area a r o o t π r r o o t 2 this was done for single trees without competition 3a and the averages of all living trees in the stand during the self thinning process 3b which accounts for the influence of competition on this relationship in the case of an approximate isotropy the values should fit the relationship 3a l n v t r e e k a l l o m 3 2 l n a t r e e 3b ln v t r e e k a l l o m 3 2 l n a t r

r e e n 1 with e k p as an average number of individuals overlapping with a point on the ground we get a t r e e n e k p 4 ln a t r e e k p l n n for instance if the trees would fit the area perfectly without gaps or overlapping there would be e k p 1 and thus kp 0 with 3b and 4 the parameters of the self thinning line 5 ln v t r e e k b l n n should be b 3 2 6 k k a l l o m 3 2 k p to relate variation of these parameters to the development of the entire stand the total stand volume m v tree was mapped and related to tree density n for a further discussion of the assumed isotropy in eq 3a we relate the allocation of the growth to the expected slope of 3 2 in eq 3a the crown growth is expressed as for derivation see appendix a 7 d v c r o w n 2 π h c r o w n r c r o w n r s t e m 2 d r

growth decreases the slope in eq 3a analogously this could be shown for root growth height and girth are not related to the area covered by a plant and thus preferred growth of these measures increases the slope in 3a 3 results 3 1 allometry to give an impression on how the model trees develop their allometric relations depending on their size and individual resource availability fig 3 exemplifies the temporal course of the stem diameter height relation for a salinity of 30 ppt the dotted line marks the relation for a tree without competing neighbours average trees exposed to absolute competition for light develop bigger crowns and taller stems this leads to a shifted line towards in average taller trees with same stem diameters the dots and crosses show the dimensions of trees at the moment of their death by lack of light or water respectively herein above ground asymmetric light related competition dominates thus most of the trees die by lacking light the big trees may die from drought stress as the axial flow resistance flow between fine roots and leaves is gaining increasing importance as shown in peters et al 2014 the tree s effort in decreasing this resistance leads to an enhanced stem diameter growth known as secondary girth growth in forestry this is reflected in the general shape of the diameter height relation at the stage a tree is at approximately maximum height water limitation by competing neighbours leads easily to water shortage that cannot be compensated by further stem diameter or root growth that is why the biggest trees predominantly die of limiting water availability fig 4 shows the relation between the logarithms of the area covered by a tree and its volume i e the bold line single tree eq 3a and the thin line average tree with competition eq 3b if this relation would be linear with a slope of 3 2 i e parallel to the background stripes all dimensions of the tree would increase proportionally isotropic scaling this would fit the assumption underlying the slope of 3 2 of the self thinning line small trees are characterised by shallower slopes as they grow mainly in root and crown diameter both root and crown growth are composed of an increment of biomass 3 dimensional proportional to the covered area for leaves and fine roots growth increases extend only in two dimensions a c r o w n in eq 8 and an increment proportional to only the radius of either root or crown branch and cable root length 1 dimensional growth a c r o w n 1 2 in eq 8 with eq 10 crown growth decreases the slope of the relation in fig 4 the augmented girth growth of bigger trees leads to steeper slopes in fig 4 compared to a good water supply 10 ppt at 60 ppt equivalent to more arid conditions the line got a similar slope but a smaller intercept this is because trees covering the same space got smaller stems at 60 ppt and thus less biomass than with better access to water 10 ppt the thin lines in fig 4 show the relationship for average living trees in the stand the deviation from the single tree line is due to competition if trees compete for either light or water growth of the area increasing measures crown or root diameter rcrown or rroot are promoted trees of highest fitness those which are less affected by competition are closer to the shape of a single tree when competition pressure decreases following the death of competitors trees will promote growth of other components these two effects lead to a reduction of the difference between the lines of single and stand trees of bigger volumes 3 2 self thinning fig 5 shows the modelled self thinning lines for the different salinities with eq 3b the thin lines in fig 5 mark ln ā from fig 4 for the corresponding tree volumes on the y axis in the upper pictures water supply is adequate low salinities and competition for light is predominating the gap between the lines 3 2 kp from eq 6 is small i e neighbouring plants overlap less than with higher salinities below both lines are almost parallel and the allometry induced change in slopes is mirrored in the self thinning line for higher salinities the gap of the lines is much bigger i e more overlapping but there is little similarity between the lines the total tree volume per hectare m of the stand is shown below fig 5 left y axis it can be seen that different sections of the self thinning line correspond to different sections of this graph m is increasing with decreasing tree density n up to a maximum level of approx mmax 750 m3 ha 1 for salinities up to 50 ppt and slightly below for 60 ppt when the total tree volume remains at this maximum level the slope of the self thinning line equals 1 with 11 v t r e e n m for the section with a constant m mmax the slope of the self thinning line is described with 12 ln v t r e e ln m m a x l n n interpreting this maximum total stand volume mmax as the maximum that can be maintained per ground unit we can deduce for the self thinning line that the slope is 1 and the intercept is the logarithm of the maximum volume maintained by ground unit ln mmax if the single trees reach their size limit and cannot grow further mortality disentangles from the competition and the slope of the self thinning line is 0 13 ln v t r e e ln v t r e e m a x 0 l n n 4 discussion 4 1 allometry the logarithmic relationship between the ground area covered by a tree and the tree s volume approximately fits the 3 2 slope there is a systematic deviation from linearity shallower slopes at the beginning when the tree is growing predominately in surface claiming root and crown radius are followed by steeper slopes for older trees when new biomass is mainly allocated into stem diameter increase this effect is even promoted by competition the intercept of an assumed average linear relation depends on the specific allometry the horizontal extension of a tree with the same volume may vary with the species identity available solar radiation as defined by the latitude available water and or rooting depths soil properties etc hence it is difficult to find a general rule regarding this intercept 4 2 self thinning we suggest three main processes fig 6 framing the shape of the self thinning line it should be noted that we omit the sometimes referred vertical course determined by the initial density in all analyses presented in this study i the allometry of the single trees determines the slope of geometric thinning the slope is related to the relationship between the area covered by a tree and its volume nevertheless as tree growth is not entirely isotropic during its lifetime e g secondary girth growth the relation is only approximately linear at the initial stage and becomes slightly steeper for bigger trees the intercept k aggregates species and site specific properties kallom individual allometry abiotic factors and the overlapping area of neighbouring trees 3 2 kp as symmetric competition promotes coexistence of neighbours the packing density of the trees may be bigger and predominate symmetric competition may lead to higher intercepts with geometric thinning the stand biomass is increasing with stand age ii the available resources are completely used and the maximum biomass per area is reached the slope of the self thinning line is 1 and the intercept is fixed by the logarithm of the maximum supported biomass per ground area with this a better resource supply would increase the intercept the stand biomass remains constant iii the upper limit is defined by the maximum plant size the slope is 0 and the intercept equals the logarithm of the maximal single tree volume the stand biomass is decreasing with the death of single trees according to this the self thinning line can be described with 16 l n v t r e e m i n k a l l o m 3 2 k p l n m m a x l n v t r e e m a x 3 2 1 0 l n n the self thinning line is defined by the minimum of these three relationships and may be shaped as illustrated in fig 6 bottom right as the assumption of an even aged stand without rejuvenation in natural stands is hardly given especially stage iii with declining total stand biomass can hardly be detected in field data nevertheless the maximum tree size caps the range of the self thinning line primarily the intercept of the three possible lines defines where the lines intersect and thus which slope is estimated to predict the self thinning line as indicated in eq 16 four parameters are needed table 1 future field and greenhouse experiments or reanalysis of empirical data should focus on estimating these parameters for instance the allometric constant kallom or the maximum plant volume vmax could be estimated for a wide range of species with available standard allometric data the other two parameters would require measurements from even aged forest stands the estimation of maximum maintainable biomass mmax may be challenging as it covers both above and below ground biomass and further requires that self thinning must already follow the exponent of b 1 altogether empirical evidence supports these findings the observed correlation between competition mode and slope of the self thinning line e g li et al 2013 lin et al 2013 can be attributed to the different intercepts of stages i and ii arid sites which are limited by below ground water supply have a lower maintainable maximum biomass per ground unit and thus the corresponding line ii has a small intercept further predominate symmetric below ground competition returns a higher intercept for the relationship i thus the self thinning process is constrained by the maximum biomass per ground area and slopes of 1 are detected in sites with sufficient resource supply and supposed light limitation geometric thinning and allometry influenced slopes of 3 2 are observed with the model runs combinations of these modes could be identified fig 5 hutchings and budd 1981 described a transition in woody stands from 3 2 to 1 with the same explanation of a reached carrying capacity of the stand further there is a remarkable match with the findings of lonsdale and watkinson 1982 they grew monocultures of english ryegrass lolium perenne with different densities and shade regimes i e restricting above ground resources for the unshaded plants they found slopes of the self thinning line of the shoot weight ranging between 1 43 and 1 46 including the root weight altered the slope to 1 26 this may indicate that the driving process was geometric thinning of the shoot parts shading regimes up to 77 led to slopes between 1 49 and 1 52 shoots only for 83 shading they estimated a slope of 1 05 for the whole plant biomass intercept k 2 51 on a common logarithmic scale they conclude that the maximum standing crop for these shade conditions was reached and suggested a theoretical slope of 1 indeed they estimated a constant final yield of about 200 gm 2 interpreting these results in the sense of the conclusions of this article we would predict the intercept of the self thinning line of k 2 30 with a slope of 1 within the approximate range of densities from 105 to 103 m 2 we would predict corresponding average plant weights of 0 0020 0 20 g compared to 0 0018 0 23 g with the original parameters further populations sown at very high densities underwent an initial period of thinning along a slope of minus 3 2 followed by a switch to a slope of minus 1 beside the fact that the authors restricted above ground resources the experiments completely confirm the findings of the modelling approach presented in this study for the stages ii and iii the identification of slope and intercept is pretty clear for the geometric thinning it could be shown that the self thinning line is almost parallel to the relation between the reciprocal area of covered ground surface and the average tree volume the horizontal shift has been discussed and mainly attributed to the packing density for the low salinities in fig 5 the self thinning line is slightly shallower than the respective relation between the tree s area and volume this implies that the density is decreasing faster the mortality is slightly higher than expected an explanation can be seen in fig 2 the resource uptake by living trees cannot fall below the maintenance costs but competition will decrease resource uptake to lower values than obtained for resource uptake without competition for bigger trees this span decreases that is the tolerance of the plants against competition decreases with age this may accelerate the self thinning process nevertheless the dispersion of measured data might avoid the detection of a change in the slope of the self thinning line in field data further pretzsch 2006 points at a possible bias by an accumulation of dead inner xylem for woody plants with this estimated stem volumes would even grow more than determined by the model and the slopes may fall significantly below 3 2 e g in wang et al 2013 for humid forest stands in china or pretzsch 2006 for the common oak stands in western germany with this modelling approach we could advance in exploring the processes of self thinning and its relationship with allometric properties of plants we overcome some limitations of the phenomenological description of the individual plants in conventional models namely i extending allometric descriptions beyond a simple distinction between above and below ground biomass ii estimating the current growth mechanistically without determining a fixed empirical maximum plant size and iii connecting the parameters of the zoi concept to explicit allometric measures the model results explain and reproduce experimentally found patterns and elucidate the parameters of the self thinning lines to our knowledge and for the first time the observed regime changes leading to a deviation in the slope of the self thinning line could be modelled authors
