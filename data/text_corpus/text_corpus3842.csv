19210,nitrogen n removal in conventional bioretention systems is highly variable owing to the low nitrate no3 elimination efficiency we hypothesized that amending bioretention cells with biochar and zero valent iron zvi could improve the no3 removal performance a well instrumented bi layer pilot scale bioretention cell was developed to test the hypothesis by investigating its hydrologic performance and no3 removal efficacy as affected by biochar and zvi amendments the cell containing 18 v v wood biochar in the vadose zone and 10 v v zvi in the saturation zone was monitored for 18 months of field infiltration tests using synthetic stormwater amended with bromide tracer and no3 compared to the control cell without amendments the biochar zvi cell increased water retention by 11 27 and mean residence time by 0 7 3 8 h the vadose zone of the biochar zvi cell removed 30 6 95 7 0 6 12 7 g of no3 n from the influent as compared with 6 1 89 6 0 1 2 9 g by that of the control cell while the performance varied with synthetic storm events and seasons in all cases the biochar zvi cell resulted in greater no3 removal than the control cell this improvement was presumably due to biochar s ability to improve water retention facilitate anoxic conditions increase residence time and provide electrons for microbial denitrification the saturation zone with zvi amendment further promoted no3 removal removal was 1 8 times greater relative to the control in the first infiltration test but was minimal in following tests the reduction in performance of the zvi amendment in subsequent tests might be due to diminished no3 n input to the saturation zone after treatment by the biochar amended vadose zone the redox potential and dissolved oxygen content at the vadose saturation zone interface also indicated more favorable denitrification conditions in the biochar zvi cell biochar amendment demonstrated significant promise for increasing nitrate removal in

global issue resulting in algal blooms across the world expanding hypoxia and dead zones and decreasing aquatic biodiversity withers et al 2014 eutrophication is largely driven by the accumulation of

highly variable and overall ineffective ahiablame et al 2012 davis et al 2009 mainly due to nitrate no3 release from microbial transformation of organic nitrogen org n and ammonium nh4 within bioretention filter media hatt et al 2008 hsieh and davis 2005 li and davis 2014 that results in high no3 concentrations in bioretention effluent an internal water storage iws layer can be created in

performance of iws on n removal varies davis 2007 hunt et al 2006 and is influenced by filter media properties hsieh et al 2007 season passeport et al 2009 hydraulic residence time brown and hunt 2011 the presence of electron donor ergas et al 2010 lopez ponnada et al 2017 and plant species zhang et al 2011 in order to improve the efficiency and consistency of no3 removal of bioretention cells a biochar and zero valent iron zvi amended bi layer system was designed and tested in this study this modified bioretention system from top to bottom consisted of a layer of mulch a vadose zone containing biochar a saturation zone amended with zvi and a drainage layer the layer above the saturation zone was defined as the vadose zone for the purpose of this paper although it did not receive rainfall during the controlled field experiments biochar is black carbon manufactured from pyrolysis of biomass under high temperature e g 250 c and o2 absent conditions lehmann and joseph 2015 biochar is porous water and nutrient retentive pollutant sorptive and environmentally recalcitrant and has been intensively explored for agricultural and environmental applications as a soil amendment and a contamination mitigator guo 2016 recently researchers have begun to evaluate biochar as a filter medium in stormwater treatment facilities to treat pollutants such as total suspended solids n phosphorus heavy metals and bacteria mohanty and boehm 2014 reddy et al 2014 tian et al 2016 a few studies using laboratory batch and column experiments observed no3 removal by biochar beck et al 2011 nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 reddy et al 2014 yet the mechanisms were not elucidated biochar as a filter medium in field scale bioretention systems has not been investigated in this study incorporation of biochar in the vadose zone of a bioretention cell is expected to enhance no3 removal from stormwater runoff in primarily two ways first previous studies showed that biochar amendment significantly increased soil water retention which is attributed to biochar s large pore volume dempster et al 2012 tian et al 2014 as such biochar amendment in the vadose zone would increase the water retention of bioretention media and subsequently improve the capture of first flush runoff reduce the peak outflow rate increase the residence time and promote redox conditions conducive to denitrification second wood derived biochar is able to stimulate soil biogeochemistry by acting as an electron shuttle kappler et al 2014 wood derived biochar also possesses the ability to donate and accept electrons reversibly presumably due to its redox active quinoid functional groups klüpfel et al 2014 the electrons stored in biochar have been found bioavailable for microbial no3 reduction saquing et al 2016 thus biochar amendment would enhance denitrification by acting as an electron donor for denitrifying bacteria zero valent iron zvi has been shown to enhance phosphate removal in stormwater lechner 2016 and nitrogen removal in other waters liu et al 2018 while zvi has long been known to enhance denitrification nielsen and nielsen 1998 till et al 1998 applying zvi in stormwater treatment systems to enhance no3 removal has not been reported zvi when added to the anoxic iws layer of a bioretention system would be oxidized primarily by water to form ferrous iron and hydrogen till et al 1998 both serving as electron donors for autotrophic denitrifiers nielsen and nielsen 1998 till et al 1998 in addition to biotic denitrification no3 could be reduced by zvi abiotically to nh4 till et al 1998 as this reaction is not environmentally beneficial its significance warrants quantitative investigations in bioretention systems bioretention systems with a bottom iws layer at pilot and field scales have been evaluated for enhancing no3 removal from stormwater brown and hunt 2011 dietz 2016 palmer et al 2013 nevertheless evaluation of the system performance was limited merely to effluent quantity and quality the impact of iws and the vadose zone above it on water retention and residence time and their further impact on pollutant removal efficiency have never been studied separately in this study a pilot scale bi layer bioretention system was designed to evaluate the performance of biochar amendment in the vadose zone and the efficacy of zvi in the saturation zone for removing no3 under field conditions the experimental system provided sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to assess separately the water retention in the vadose and saturation zones and quantify the event specific and cumulative efficiencies of biochar and zvi for removing no3 from stormwater runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 the pilot scale bi layer bioretention system two parallel pilot scale bioretention systems were constructed adjacent to a parking lot at the university of delaware campus newark de in december 2014 as shown in fig s1 supporting information detailed descriptions of the field site and the inlet and outlet controls are provided in supporting information briefly the two bioretention systems the control cell and the biochar zvi cell were constructed by installing filter media and perforated pipes in two hdpe cylindrical tanks 91 cm i d 122 cm height fig 1 a perforated pipe 2 7 cm i d 3 3 cm o d was placed at the bottom of each tank and covered by 5 cm of rice gravel d50 4 25 mm as the drainage layer over the drainage layer a 15 cm saturation zone was created by increasing the outflow elevation of the drainage pipe using 90 elbows fig 1 the saturation zone was filled with coarse sand predominantly 0 15 1 0 mm mason dixon sand gravel port deposit md in the control cell and coarse sand 10 v v zvi peerless metal powders and abrasive detroit mi mix in the biochar zvi cell to inoculate the saturation zones 500 mg l activated sludge solution wilmington wastewater treatment plant wilmington de was prepared by diluting 8 l of 8000 mg l activated sludge in dechlorinated tap water and adding it to the saturation zone of each cell until effluent was observed at the drainage outlet a 76 cm vadose zone was created above the saturation zone by dry packing the control cell with a conventional soil mix and the biochar zvi cell with biochar amended 18 v v soil mix the soil mix is a standard bioretention mixture made up of 88 c33 concrete sand 0 15 5 0 mm 8 fines and 4 sawdust by mass ncdwq 2007 or 62 c33 sand 11 fines and 27 sawdust by volume the fines were obtained from mason dixon sand gravel port deposit md and consisted of 63 clay 12 silt and 25 sand by mass the sawdust was obtained from second chance hardwoods elkton md and derived from white oak and white cedar wood soil reef sr biochar d50 0 62 mm was commercially produced by the biochar company berwyn pa through pyrolysis of southern yellow pine at 550 c with properties reported elsewhere saquing et al 2016 the vadose zone layer was mulched with 5 cm of shredded hardwood bark for protection physicochemical properties of the bioretention filter media are shown in table 1 while landscaping is relevant to the performance and function of bioretention lucas and greenway 2008 in order to evaluate pollutant removal by filter media only without plant uptake no plants were grown in the cells in each cell two pvc pipes 2 6 cm i d 3 3 cm o d were installed vertically one was connected to the perforated drainage pipe through a tee at the cell bottom while the other was placed just above the saturation zone with its bottom opening covered with a layer of geotextile the vertical pipes were used to monitor water levels in the cells and collect pore water samples at the top and bottom of the saturation zone in each cell seven soil moisture sensors ec 5 two dielectric water potential temperature sensors mps 2 and two soil temperature sensors rt 1 all sensors from decagon devices pullman wa were installed in the filter media as shown in fig 1 to monitor hydrologic conditions the soil moisture sensors were calibrated separately for media in each cell the biochar had a significant impact on calibration because of its influence on the apparent dielectric permittivity kameyama et al 2014 the configuration of the control and biochar zvi cells was the same except that the biochar zvi cell contained biochar in the vadose zone and zvi in the saturation zone 2 2 bromide and nitrate infiltration tests four infiltration experiments were conducted to evaluate the hydraulic performance and no3 removal efficiency of the bi layer bioretention system with biochar and zvi amendments the first two experiments were conducted in april test 1 and june test 2 of 2015 with identical protocols experimental conditions and protocols are listed in table 2 prior to each infiltration experiment 100 l of dechlorinated tap water was prepared in 55 gal tanks by adding a stoichiometric amount of sodium sulfite na2so3 then pumped to each cell and uniformly spread with shower sprayers at 0 6 l min for 3 h steady downward flow conditions were achieved as indicated by equal inflow and outflow rates which were monitored throughout each test after reaching steady flow dechlorinated tap water spiked with br as kbr at 90 mg l and no3 n as nano3 at 10 mg l was loaded into each cell for 0 5 h the selected nitrate concentration is in the range of reported no3 n and tn concentrations in stormwater runoff jung et al 2013 yufen et al 2008 the bioretention cells were then flushed with the original dechlorinated tap water for 20 5 h in addition to the 0 5 h pulse introduction of no3 n the tap water contained a background no3 n concentration of 2 0 mg l that originated from white clay creek the drinking water source for city of newark de throughout the 24 h test the inflow rate was maintained at 0 6 l min equivalent to 5 5 cm h a hydraulic loading rate mimicking the mean annual storm rainfall of 6 8 cm in delaware within a 24 h duration assuming the bioretention cell area was 5 of the drainage area with 100 impervious surface this intense synthetic storm event was intended to evaluate the biochar zvi bi layer for high stormwater flow and significant first flush concentrations of no3 n when the ability of the system to treat no3 n might be most challenged the long duration storm event also permitted complete sampling of the tracer breakthrough curve the third test was conducted in august 2015 with a similar protocol except that the no3 n was spiked at higher concentrations in the br tracer pulse 24 mg l and in the after pulse water 22 mg l this high no3 n loading was specified to evaluate the ultimate capacity of the two bioretention cells for nitrate removal the fourth test was conducted in september 2016 to assess the system performance after 1 yr aging since the third test similar protocols as for tests 1 and 2 were followed except that the no3 n br pulse was reduced to 0 25 h followed by 48 h after pulse water and the hydraulic loading reduced to 1 2 of that of previous tests the smaller hydraulic loading for test 4 was necessitated by a reduction in infiltration capacity of the control cell which was determined before the start of the experiment there was negligible reduction in infiltration capacity of the biochar zvi cell the clogging of the control cell is likely due to long term compaction of the 70 cm thick vadose zone less compaction was expected for the biochar zvi cell since the biochar amended vadose zone had an initial bulk density of 1 27 g cm3 16 less than 1 51 g cm3 in the control cell table 1 and thus less downward compaction force than the control cell in addition soil amended with wood derived biochar has been shown to decrease soil compressibility reddy et al 2015 although the mechanisms are unclear finally the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity of the biochar amended vadose zone was four times larger than that of the control cell table 1 thus any compaction that occurred in the biochar zvi cell did not reduce the infiltration capacity as much as for the control cell the no3 n concentration was 20 5 mg l in the 0 25 h pulse input for test 4 but only maintained at 1 2 mg l in the after pulse water before and between the infiltration tests the bioretention cells were covered with plastic sheets to exclude natural precipitation 2 3 sampling and analysis methods during the individual infiltration tests the influents were manually sampled 100 ml every 2 h while the effluents were sampled 200 ml every hour by a hach sigma 900 max portable sampler loveland co the pore water in the cells was sampled 100 ml every 2 h from the vertical pipe above the saturation zone using a peristaltic pump field blanks were also collected and analyzed all samples were stored in a cooler with ice bags at the end of each test samples were transferred to the lab and filtered with 0 22 μm membrane filters before storage at 4 c no3 and br concentrations were determined within 48 h after the sample collection using metrohm personal ic 790 metrohm ltd herisau switzerland fifty ml of each sample were preserved in 50 mlcentrifuge tubes with pre acidification by adding 30 μl of 18 m sulfuric acid prior to ic analysis for nh4 concentrations within seven days the ic detection limits for br no3 n and nh4 n were 5 μg l 5 μg l and 40 μg l respectively the pore water samples from the top and bottom of the saturation zones in all four tests were measured for ph and samples from the latter three tests were further measured for dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp using a multiparameter portable meter with a flow cell hi98194 hanna instruments woonsocket ri 2 4 data analysis the br breakthrough data were plotted on a semi log scale and exponentially extrapolated to zero based on the tailing concentrations jin 1995 the br cumulative mass recovery was calculated by integrating the product of br concentration and outflow rate over time the mean residence time mrt of the bioretention cells was calculated as follows jin 1995 1 m r t 0 t b t c d t a a t b c b 0 t b c d t a c b 2 c c b e t t b a where t b is the time where br breakthrough curve starts to be extrapolated 1 a is the slope of the exponentially extrapolated straight line and c b is the tracer concentration at time t b unless specified no3 n removal reported in this study was cumulative removal in percentage of the total influent no3 n mass since all the tests were conducted at a steady and specified stormwater flux without flow reduction no3 n removal was only due to concentration reduction 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance the volumetric water content profiles in the vadose zones of the test bioretention cells were examined before each test and after the steady state infiltrations using in situ moisture sensors the results are shown in fig 2 before test 1 the initially dry packed vadose zone media imbibed water from the lower saturation zone through capillary forces with water content generally increasing with depth compared to test 1 the initial vadose zone volumetric water contents before infiltration increased for test 2 and 3 by an average of 13 2 and 21 7 respectively which is due to dissolution of entrapped air and compaction of the filter media approximate 4 0 cm depth compaction was observed in both control and biochar zvi cells before the start of test 2 vadose zone water contents decreased for both cells before infiltration in test 4 by 5 7 on average compared to test 3 and was likely because of the 1 yr period between test 3 and 4 with no infiltration during each infiltration test as flow in each cell approached steady state the volumetric water contents in the control and biochar zvi cells increased and reached steady state values fig 2 there were no obvious changes in water content in the bottom 25 cm of each vadose zone after infiltration in test 2 after steady state flow conditions were reached the volumetric water content at the top 5 cm of the control cell was significantly higher than starting conditions and close to total porosity which was due to shallow ponded water in the mulch layer observed during test 2 after steady state infiltration the vadose zone of the biochar zvi cell retained 19 41 l 10 7 27 0 more water than the control cell in all tests table 3 the additional water retention in the biochar amended vadose zone is attributed to biochar intraparticle porosity 0 83 0 01se ml g biochar se one estimated standard error imhoff and nakhli 2017 and its influence on interparticle pore space the addition of biochar increased total porosity of the vadose zone from 0 42 0 01se control cell to 0 51 0 01se biochar zvi cell a 20 increase table 1 the br mass recoveries as reported in table 3 ranged from 81 to 89 for control and biochar zvi cells for tests 1 3 but decreased to 69 72 in test 4 the smaller mass recovery for test 4 is due to the approximately 73 1 less br input in test 4 which was insufficient to quantify the tailing of br breakthrough with a fixed br detection limit compare figs s2 and s3 in supporting information because br does not interact with zvi you et al 2005 zhang et al 2004 and is not sorbed to biochar significantly the 2 8 smaller br mass recovery in biochar zvi versus control for all tests is likely due to increased total pore volume pv after adding biochar and zvi table 1 the mrts of the biochar zvi cell determined from br transport table 3 were 0 88 and 0 70 h longer than the control cell in test 1 and 2 respectively representing a 12 4 and 10 5 increase the longer mrt is comparable to the increased residence time in biochar zvi versus control cell 1 11 h for test 1 and 0 58 h for test 2 calculated by the increased water retained in the vadose zone 38 and 19 l thus the vadose zone with biochar played a predominant role in residence time increase the mrt for the control cell in test 3 was 2 0 h less than that for the control cell in tests 1 and 2 even though hydraulic loadings were identical this may have been caused by severe preferential flow in the control cell in test 3 which is also demonstrated by the early br peak in the breakthrough curve fig s3 while insufficient information in br breakthrough curves in test 4 likely caused underestimation of mrts for test 4 table 3 the larger residence time in biochar zvi versus control cell would remain thus while residence times varied between the four experiments in all cases hydraulic residence times were greater in the biochar zvi than the control cell because biochar increased water retention 3 2 nitrate removal fig 3 shows the no3 n breakthrough curve and cumulative no3 n removal in tests 1 and 2 while peak influent no3 n concentrations were attenuated in the effluent from the control cell much more pronounced no3 n removal was observed in the biochar zvi cell furthermore both cells removed more nitrate in test 2 which is expected given the longer time for enrichment of denitrifying populations and higher ambient temperature in test 2 versus test 1 22 c versus 12 c cumulative no3 n removal for the control and biochar zvi cells fig 3b and d for tests 1 and 2 respectively both decreased during the 20 5 h following the pulse input the decreases in treatment efficiency were 42 59 in the control cell which were more rapid and pronounced compared to the 7 28 decreases in the biochar zvi cell although initial high removal in both cells is partially due to dilution with resident water after 1 pv of flow the biochar zvi cell maintained 84 0 and 96 6 of no3 n removal in test 1 and 2 respectively whereas no3 n removal in the control cell decreased to 26 8 and 83 4 overall the biochar zvi cell removed approximately 4 7 times 66 2 vs 14 2 and 1 6 times 92 8 vs 58 3 more no3 n than the control cell in tests 1 and 2 the biochar zvi cell maintained its better no3 n removal than the control cell in tests 3 and 4 fig s4 with 2 4 times more removal when total no3 n input was high 17 8 g in test 3 and with 1 1 times more removal when hydraulic load was low 2 7 cm h in test 4 noticeably the percent no3 n removal in test 3 decreased compared to test 2 from 58 3 to 29 6 for the control cell and 92 9 to 72 4 for the biochar zvi cell fig 4 however the no3 n mass removal in test 3 was more than 10 times higher than that in the other tests fig 5 which is due to the higher total no3 n input table 2 in test 3 the smaller percent no3 n removal in test 3 versus test 2 in the control cell might be due to preferential flow in test 3 that was indicated by early arrival of the peak tracer concentration fig s3 from the orp and do monitoring fig 6 discussed below the biochar zvi cell still provided more favorable conditions for denitrification than the control cell in test 4 the relatively small 10 improvement in removal by biochar zvi versus control is likely due to the high average vadose zone water content 0 34 and long residence time mrt 12 0 h in the control cell almost twice the mrts in tests 1 and 2 and three times that of test 3 while the control cell performed nearly as well as the biochar zvi cell in test 4 the hydraulic capacity of the control cell was approximately 50 smaller than the biochar zvi cell since infiltration rate was reduced fig 6 shows orp and do monitored at the vadose saturation zone interface and at the bottom of the saturation zone in test 2 the orp measurements indicated favorable conditions for denitrification in both cells although orp in the biochar zvi cell was significantly lower than the control cell the do concentrations were also smaller at both measurement depths in the biochar zvi versus the control cell similar results were observed for test 3 and 4 fig s5 overall the biochar zvi cell removed 10 370 more no3 n than the control cell in all tests which strongly demonstrates the ability of biochar zvi media to enhance no3 removal in bioretention systems compared to other bioretention cells with iws table 4 the biochar zvi cell showed higher no3 n removal despite high no3 n and hydraulic loading as well as the absence of plant uptake 3 3 effects of biochar on nitrate removal pore water samples at the vadose saturation zone interface are helpful to separate no3 n removal in these two regions the percent no3 n removal in each zone defined as the mass ratio of the no3 n removed in that zone to the total no3 n in the influent is shown in fig 4 and the corresponding no3 n mass reduction is shown in fig 5 compared to the control cell biochar amendment markedly enhanced no3 n removal in the vadose zone for all tests this significant no3 n removal caused by biochar is also illustrated by the no3 concentration profiles of the cell pore water and effluents which is shown in fig 7 for tests 1 and 2 as flow rate was constant throughout the tests the difference between the integrated area of influent and effluent concentrations of the control vadose zone region with diagonal lines in fig 7 represents i e is proportional to the cumulative no3 n removed in the control vadose zone the yellow area between the control and biochar zvi vadose zone concentrations represents the additional no3 n removed due to biochar in both tests 1 and 2 the yellow areas are larger than the diagonal areas supporting our hypothesis that biochar amendment enhances denitrification similar results were found using no3 n concentration data for test 3 fig s8 in test 4 despite high no3 n removal in the control cell indicated by the large diagonal line region biochar still contributed additional no3 n removal the greater no3 removal in the biochar amended vadose zone may be attributed to two mechanisms first by increasing both porosity and water saturation biochar increased the volumetric water content in the vadose zone which increased the residence time and the size of the low oxygen region for instance biochar increased total porosity by an average of 13 5 in the first two tests and the average water saturation from 65 to 73 in test 1 table 3 by increasing the water filled pore space biochar increased the residence time for denitrification reported above and the volume in the vadose zone that was conducive to anaerobic microbial activities such as denitrification further the oxygen content of this water was lower than in the control cell with no biochar fig 6 for tests 1 and 2 and fig s5 for tests 3 and 4 since volumetric water content was higher table 3 and diffusion paths within water longer several empirical modeling approaches describing denitrification in the subsurface use water saturation as a surrogate parameter to account for limiting oxygen conditions akhavan et al 2012 heinen 2006 huwe and totsche 1995 in these modeling studies changes in water saturation are used to modify in situ rates of denitrification consistent with observations in this study the 89 4 no3 n removal in the vadose zone of the control cell in test 4 largest of all control cell tests demonstrated that water saturation and mrt are crucial to no3 n removal because of compaction and material aging a hydraulic loading of 2 7 cm h was the maximum that could be maintained in the control cell which resulted in mrt that was twice or three times that of previous tests in the control cell while maintaining similarly high volumetric water contents table 3 that favor anaerobic conditions similar compaction and loss of hydraulic capacity was not observed in the biochar zvi cell only for test 4 was orp 0 for water collected from the control cell fig s5 in addition to increasing porosity and water saturation biochemically biochar could have promoted denitrification by serving as an electron donor for nitrate reducing bacteria using the same sr biochar as in this study saquing et al 2016 reported that biochar could be reduced or charged by serving as an electron acceptor for acetate oxidation and the reduced biochar then acted as an electron donor for no3 reduction by geobacter metallireducens the ability of biochar to serve as both electron donor and acceptor has been attributed to the redox facile hydro quinone groups in biochar that can undergo reversible electron donation and acceptance klüpfel et al 2014 saquing et al 2016 similarly biochar in the saturated region of the vadose zone could have been reduced prior to the tests by serving as an electron acceptor for microbial oxidation of organic carbon from mulch and soil mix the stored electrons in biochar could then be released to support autotrophic denitrification during the tests in test 3 the mean temperature and hydraulic load were the same as in test 2 while its total no3 n input was 14 times higher the effluent no3 n concentration from the control cell in test 3 was close to the influent concentration 22 5 mg l 6 h after tracer addition fig s4 and the control vadose zone only treated 2 9 g no3 n fig 5 on the other hand the effluent no3 n concentration from the biochar zvi cell was below 10 mg l during test 3 and 12 7 g no3 n was removed in the vadose zone with biochar the significantly higher no3 n removal capacity in test 3 versus test 2 may be due in part to the electrons stored in biochar that were involved in denitrification the microbial accessible electron donating and accepting capacity of sr biochar was shown to be 0 86 mmol g saquing et al 2016 assuming that all electrons for the additional no3 n removal up to 9 8 g in test 3 fig 5 came from biochar in the saturated region bottom 25 cm of the vadose zone and that all no3 n was converted into n2 i e 5 electrons nitrate up to 0 43 mmol g of electrons would have been derived from biochar for the enhanced denitrification which was well within the capacity of sr biochar there might be other effects of biochar that contributed to the no3 n removal in tests 1 4 such as no3 sorption onto biochar retention in biochar intrapore water ph alteration and release of dissolved organic carbon doc however these effects are likely limited yang et al 2017 reported limited no3 sorption on various biochars pyrolyzed from different biomass at different temperatures including a pinewood based biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c which is similar to sr biochar used in this study furthermore soil particles and clay minerals often show more no3 sorption than biochar on a mass basis yang et al 2017 in this study 147 kg of control soil was replaced by 25 kg of biochar in the biochar zvi cell thus even less no3 n sorption in the biochar zvi cell should be expected because total br recovery for the biochar zvi cell was at most 8 2 lower than that for the control cell over all tests the no3 n retained with water should be small ph was unlikely to account for the higher no3 n removal since the pore water ph in the vadose zone fig s6 of the control and biochar zvi cells were both in the favorable ph range of 5 5 8 0 for heterotrophic denitrifiers rivett et al 2008 finally the leachable doc from sr biochar was rather low 1 2 ppm saquing et al 2016 and negligible compared to the doc from mulch and sawdust neculita and zagury 2008 saquing et al 2016 as electron donor for denitrification doc monitored in test 4 fig s7 showed that doc concentrations in the effluent of the biochar zvi cell were lower than that of the control cell by a factor of 4 3 4 effects of zvi on nitrate removal in test 1 the control cell saturation zone removed 20 2 of the input no3 n however its denitrifying capacity was limited since little removal occurred after 8 h fig 7 in contrast approximately 0 7 mg l of no3 n was continuously removed in the saturation zone with zvi throughout test 1 with 1 8 times more no3 n removed than the control saturation zone this constant and sustained nitrate removal see fig 7 indicates that zvi in the saturation zone changed the capacity of denitrification in the iws this is consistent with our understanding of how zvi enhances denitrification during the pulse test anaerobic corrosion of zvi would continuously generate h2 and fe2 as electron donors to support autotrophic denitrification in the saturation zone resulting in a greater and more sustained no3 consumption however in test 2 the saturation zone with zvi removed less no3 n than the control which might be due to the significantly lower incoming no3 n concentration 0 22 0 70 mg l for the biochar zvi cell vs 0 72 2 02 mg l for the control cell from the upper layer with biochar amendment even with such low incoming concentrations the no3 n concentration was still further decreased to 0 1 mg l in the saturation zone with zvi it is reasonable to presume that the no3 n removal due to zvi would have been higher if entering no3 n concentrations had been the same for both saturation zones similar phenomena were seen in tests 3 and 4 and are presented in fig s8 although zvi consumption could result in less nitrate reduction the ph changes between biochar zvi vadose and saturation zones fig s6 suggest that the zvi in the saturation zone maintained a similar rate of corrosion after 18 months in addition to supporting microbial denitrification in test 1 zvi also reduced no3 n chemically forming 90 mg of nh4 n in the saturation zone fig s9 this produced nh4 n is equivalent to 12 8 of the total no3 n removed 700 mg in the saturation zone with zvi suggesting that no3 n removal in the saturation zone with zvi was approximately 13 abiotic and 87 microbial in test 1 in tests 2 4 the cumulative nh4 n mass decreased tests 2 and 3 or remained unchanged test 4 in the biochar zvi saturation zone fig s9 which indicates that abiotic nitrate reduction was minimal and no3 n removal was due to biotic denitrification biotic denitrification is more desirable than abiotic reduction as its end product is the innocuous and less bioavailable n2 nh4 n was observed to increase in pore water in the vadose zones for all tests except the control vadose zone in test 3 and nh4 n decreased or remained unchanged in saturation zones for all tests except the biochar zvi saturation zone in test 1 fig s9 although nh4 n was generated during tests in both cells the amount of nh4 n collected in the effluent accounted for less than 5 of the total input no3 n fig s10 decreasing the overall tn removal by 1 0 8 6 the mechanisms for nh4 n formation in pore water of bioretention cells should be examined in future work 4 conclusions during four stormwater infiltration tests over 18 months the biochar zvi cell showed greater water retention longer residence time and higher no3 n removal compared to the control cell biochar amendment in the vadose zone increased total porosity and water retention likely due to its abundant intrapores and influence on interparticle pore space biochar amended at the lower depth of the vadose zone that was nearly water saturated could have also served as an electron donor to enhance denitrification zvi amendment in the saturation zone provided further no3 n removal due to its reducing properties however the effect of zvi amendment on no3 n removal was only obvious in test 1 with the impact diminished in following tests biochar amendment in the vadose zone showed continued enhancement of no3 n removal in all experiments these results indicate that adding wood derived biochar to the vadose zone and zvi to the saturation zone can increase no3 n removal by 10 370 compared to conventional bioretention media in developed regions where installation of new stormwater treatment systems to achieve regulatory compliance is limited biochar and zvi amendments may provide additional treatment furthermore no3 n removal in this study resulted only from concentration reduction additional no3 n removal is expected when flow reduction and plant uptake are accounted for biochar amendment increased water retention by 11 27 and prevented clogging and loss of infiltration capacity thus enabling the biochar zvi system to treat more stormwater than a standard bioretention medium future work should evaluate the long term performance of biochar and zvi

19210,nitrogen n removal in conventional bioretention systems is highly variable owing to the low nitrate no3 elimination efficiency we hypothesized that amending bioretention cells with biochar and zero valent iron zvi could improve the no3 removal performance a well instrumented bi layer pilot scale bioretention cell was developed to test the hypothesis by investigating its hydrologic performance and no3 removal efficacy as affected by biochar and zvi amendments the cell containing 18 v v wood biochar in the vadose zone and 10 v v zvi in the saturation zone was monitored for 18 months of field infiltration tests using synthetic stormwater amended with bromide tracer and no3 compared to the control cell without amendments the biochar zvi cell increased water retention by 11 27 and mean residence time by 0 7 3 8 h the vadose zone of the biochar zvi cell removed 30 6 95 7 0 6 12 7 g of no3 n from the influent as compared with 6 1 89 6 0 1 2 9 g by that of the control cell while the performance varied with synthetic storm events and seasons in all cases the biochar zvi cell resulted in greater no3 removal than the control cell this improvement was presumably due to biochar s ability to improve water retention facilitate anoxic conditions increase residence time and provide electrons for microbial denitrification the saturation zone with zvi amendment further promoted no3 removal removal was 1 8 times greater relative to the control in the first infiltration test but was minimal in following tests the reduction in performance of the zvi amendment in subsequent tests might be due to diminished no3 n input to the saturation zone after treatment by the biochar amended vadose zone the redox potential and dissolved oxygen content at the vadose saturation zone interface also indicated more favorable denitrification conditions in the biochar zvi cell biochar amendment demonstrated significant promise for increasing nitrate removal in

the presence of electron donor ergas et al 2010 lopez ponnada et al 2017 and plant species zhang et al 2011 in order to improve the efficiency and consistency of no3 removal of bioretention cells a biochar and zero valent iron zvi amended bi layer system was designed and tested in this study this modified bioretention system from top to bottom consisted of a layer of mulch a vadose zone containing biochar a saturation zone amended with zvi and a drainage layer the layer above the saturation zone was defined as the vadose zone for the purpose of this paper although it did not receive rainfall during the controlled field experiments biochar is black carbon manufactured from pyrolysis of biomass under high temperature e g 250 c and o2 absent conditions lehmann and joseph 2015 biochar is porous water and nutrient retentive pollutant sorptive and environmentally recalcitrant and has been intensively explored for agricultural and environmental applications as a soil amendment and a contamination mitigator guo 2016 recently researchers have begun to evaluate biochar as a filter medium in stormwater treatment facilities to treat pollutants such as total suspended solids n phosphorus heavy metals and bacteria mohanty and boehm 2014 reddy et al 2014 tian et al 2016 a few studies using laboratory batch and column experiments observed no3 removal by biochar beck et al 2011 nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 reddy et al 2014 yet the mechanisms were not elucidated biochar as a filter medium in field scale bioretention systems has not been investigated in this study incorporation of biochar in the vadose zone of a bioretention cell is expected to enhance no3 removal from stormwater runoff in primarily two ways first previous studies showed that biochar amendment significantly increased soil water retention which is attributed to biochar s large pore volume dempster et al 2012 tian et al 2014 as such biochar amendment in the vadose zone would increase the water retention of bioretention media and subsequently improve the capture of first flush runoff reduce the peak outflow rate increase the residence time and promote redox conditions conducive to denitrification second wood derived biochar is able to stimulate soil biogeochemistry by acting as an electron shuttle kappler et al 2014 wood derived biochar also possesses the ability to donate and accept electrons reversibly presumably due to its redox active quinoid functional groups klüpfel et al 2014 the electrons stored in biochar have been found bioavailable for microbial no3 reduction saquing et al 2016 thus biochar amendment would enhance denitrification by acting as an electron donor for denitrifying bacteria zero valent iron zvi has been shown to enhance phosphate removal in stormwater lechner 2016 and nitrogen removal in other waters liu et al 2018 while zvi has long been known to enhance denitrification nielsen and nielsen 1998 till et al 1998 applying zvi in stormwater treatment systems to enhance no3 removal has not been reported zvi when added to the anoxic iws layer of a bioretention system would be oxidized primarily by water to form ferrous iron and hydrogen till et al 1998 both serving as electron donors for autotrophic denitrifiers nielsen and nielsen 1998 till et al 1998 in addition to biotic denitrification no3 could be reduced by zvi abiotically to nh4 till et al 1998 as this reaction is not environmentally beneficial its significance warrants quantitative investigations in bioretention systems bioretention systems with a bottom iws layer at pilot and field scales have been evaluated for enhancing no3 removal from stormwater brown and hunt 2011 dietz 2016 palmer et al 2013 nevertheless evaluation of the system performance was limited merely to effluent quantity and quality the impact of iws and the vadose zone above it on water retention and residence time and their further impact on pollutant removal efficiency have never been studied separately in this study a pilot scale bi layer bioretention system was designed to evaluate the performance of biochar amendment in the vadose zone and the efficacy of zvi in the saturation zone for removing no3 under field conditions the experimental system provided sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to assess separately the water retention in the vadose and saturation zones and quantify the event specific and cumulative efficiencies of biochar and zvi for removing no3 from stormwater runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 the pilot scale bi layer bioretention system two parallel pilot scale bioretention systems were constructed adjacent to a parking lot at the university of delaware campus newark de in december 2014 as shown in fig s1 supporting information detailed descriptions of the field site and the inlet and outlet controls are provided in supporting information briefly the two bioretention systems the control cell and the biochar zvi cell were constructed by installing filter media and perforated pipes in two hdpe cylindrical tanks 91 cm i d 122 cm height fig 1 a perforated pipe 2 7 cm i d 3 3 cm o d was placed at the bottom of each tank and covered by 5 cm of rice gravel d50 4 25 mm as the drainage layer over the drainage layer a 15 cm saturation zone was created by increasing the outflow elevation of the drainage pipe using 90 elbows fig 1 the saturation zone was filled with coarse sand predominantly 0 15 1 0 mm mason dixon sand gravel port deposit md in the control cell and coarse sand 10 v v zvi peerless metal powders and abrasive detroit mi mix in the biochar zvi cell to inoculate the saturation zones 500 mg l activated sludge solution wilmington wastewater treatment plant wilmington de was prepared by diluting 8 l of 8000 mg l activated sludge in dechlorinated tap water and adding it to the saturation zone of each cell until effluent was observed at the drainage outlet a 76 cm vadose zone was created above the saturation zone by dry packing the control cell with a conventional soil mix and the biochar zvi cell with biochar amended 18 v v soil mix the soil mix is a standard bioretention mixture made up of 88 c33 concrete sand 0 15 5 0 mm 8 fines and 4 sawdust by mass ncdwq 2007 or 62 c33 sand 11 fines and 27 sawdust by volume the fines were obtained from mason dixon sand gravel port deposit md and consisted of 63 clay 12 silt and 25 sand by mass the sawdust was obtained from second chance hardwoods elkton md and derived from white oak and white cedar wood soil reef sr biochar d50 0 62 mm was commercially produced by the biochar company berwyn pa through pyrolysis of southern yellow pine at 550 c with properties reported elsewhere saquing et al 2016 the vadose zone layer was mulched with 5 cm of shredded hardwood bark for protection physicochemical properties of the bioretention filter media are shown in table 1 while landscaping is relevant to the performance and function of bioretention lucas and greenway 2008 in order to evaluate pollutant removal by filter media only without plant uptake no plants were grown in the cells in each cell two pvc pipes 2 6 cm i d 3 3 cm o d were installed vertically one was connected to the perforated drainage pipe through a tee at the cell bottom while the other was placed just above the saturation zone with its bottom opening covered with a layer of geotextile the vertical pipes were used to monitor water levels in the cells and collect pore water samples at the top and bottom of the saturation zone in each cell seven soil moisture sensors ec 5 two dielectric water potential temperature sensors mps 2 and two soil temperature sensors rt 1 all sensors from decagon devices pullman wa were installed in the filter media as shown in fig 1 to monitor hydrologic conditions the soil moisture sensors were calibrated separately for media in each cell the biochar had a significant impact on calibration because of its influence on the apparent dielectric permittivity kameyama et al 2014 the configuration of the control and biochar zvi cells was the same except that the biochar zvi cell contained biochar in the vadose zone and zvi in the saturation zone 2 2 bromide and nitrate infiltration tests four infiltration experiments were conducted to evaluate the hydraulic performance and no3 removal efficiency of the bi layer bioretention system with biochar and zvi amendments the first two experiments were conducted in april test 1 and june test 2 of 2015 with identical protocols experimental conditions and protocols are listed in table 2 prior to each infiltration experiment 100 l of dechlorinated tap water was prepared in 55 gal tanks by adding a stoichiometric amount of sodium sulfite na2so3 then pumped to each cell and uniformly spread with shower sprayers at 0 6 l min for 3 h steady downward flow conditions were achieved as indicated by equal inflow and outflow rates which were monitored throughout each test after reaching steady flow dechlorinated tap water spiked with br as kbr at 90 mg l and no3 n as nano3 at 10 mg l was loaded into each cell for 0 5 h the selected nitrate concentration is in the range of reported no3 n and tn concentrations in stormwater runoff jung et al 2013 yufen et al 2008 the bioretention cells were then flushed with the original dechlorinated tap water for 20 5 h in addition to the 0 5 h pulse introduction of no3 n the tap water contained a background no3 n concentration of 2 0 mg l that originated from white clay creek the drinking water source for city of newark de throughout the 24 h test the inflow rate was maintained at 0 6 l min equivalent to 5 5 cm h a hydraulic loading rate mimicking the mean annual storm rainfall of 6 8 cm in delaware within a 24 h duration assuming the bioretention cell area was 5 of the drainage area with 100 impervious surface this intense synthetic storm event was intended to evaluate the biochar zvi bi layer for high stormwater flow and significant first flush concentrations of no3 n when the ability of the system to treat no3 n might be most challenged the long duration storm event also permitted complete sampling of the tracer breakthrough curve the third test was conducted in august 2015 with a similar protocol except that the no3 n was spiked at higher concentrations in the br tracer pulse 24 mg l and in the after pulse water 22 mg l this high no3 n loading was specified to evaluate the ultimate capacity of the two bioretention cells for nitrate removal the fourth test was conducted in september 2016 to assess the system performance after 1 yr aging since the third test similar protocols as for tests 1 and 2 were followed except that the no3 n br pulse was reduced to 0 25 h followed by 48 h after pulse water and the hydraulic loading reduced to 1 2 of that of previous tests the smaller hydraulic loading for test 4 was necessitated by a reduction in infiltration capacity of the control cell which was determined before the start of the experiment there was negligible reduction in infiltration capacity of the biochar zvi cell the clogging of the control cell is likely due to long term compaction of the 70 cm thick vadose zone less compaction was expected for the biochar zvi cell since the biochar amended vadose zone had an initial bulk density of 1 27 g cm3 16 less than 1 51 g cm3 in the control cell table 1 and thus less downward compaction force than the control cell in addition soil amended with wood derived biochar has been shown to decrease soil compressibility reddy et al 2015 although the mechanisms are unclear finally the initial saturated hydraulic conductivity of the biochar amended vadose zone was four times larger than that of the control cell table 1 thus any compaction that occurred in the biochar zvi cell did not reduce the infiltration capacity as much as for the control cell the no3 n concentration was 20 5 mg l in the 0 25 h pulse input for test 4 but only maintained at 1 2 mg l in the after pulse water before and between the infiltration tests the bioretention cells were covered with plastic sheets to exclude natural precipitation 2 3 sampling and analysis methods during the individual infiltration tests the influents were manually sampled 100 ml every 2 h while the effluents were sampled 200 ml every hour by a hach sigma 900 max portable sampler loveland co the pore water in the cells was sampled 100 ml every 2 h from the vertical pipe above the saturation zone using a peristaltic pump field blanks were also collected and analyzed all samples were stored in a cooler with ice bags at the end of each test samples were transferred to the lab and filtered with 0 22 μm membrane filters before storage at 4 c no3 and br concentrations were determined within 48 h after the sample collection using metrohm personal ic 790 metrohm ltd herisau switzerland fifty ml of each sample were preserved in 50 mlcentrifuge tubes with pre acidification by adding 30 μl of 18 m sulfuric acid prior to ic analysis for nh4 concentrations within seven days the ic detection limits for br no3 n and nh4 n were 5 μg l 5 μg l and 40 μg l respectively the pore water samples from the top and bottom of the saturation zones in all four tests were measured for ph and samples from the latter three tests were further measured for dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp using a multiparameter portable meter with a flow cell hi98194 hanna instruments woonsocket ri 2 4 data analysis the br breakthrough data were plotted on a semi log scale and exponentially extrapolated to zero based on the tailing concentrations jin 1995 the br cumulative mass recovery was calculated by integrating the product of br concentration and outflow rate over time the mean residence time mrt of the bioretention cells was calculated as follows jin 1995 1 m r t 0 t b t c d t a a t b c b 0 t b c d t a c b 2 c c b e t t b a where t b is the time where br breakthrough curve starts to be extrapolated 1 a is the slope of the exponentially extrapolated straight line and c b is the tracer concentration at time t b unless specified no3 n removal reported in this study was cumulative removal in percentage of the total influent no3 n mass since all the tests were conducted at a steady and specified stormwater flux without flow reduction no3 n removal was only due to concentration reduction 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance the volumetric water content profiles in the vadose zones of the test bioretention cells were examined before each test and after the steady state infiltrations using in situ moisture sensors the results are shown in fig 2 before test 1 the initially dry packed vadose zone media imbibed water from the lower saturation zone through capillary forces with water content generally increasing with depth compared to test 1 the initial vadose zone volumetric water contents before infiltration increased for test 2 and 3 by an average of 13 2 and 21 7 respectively which is due to dissolution of entrapped air and compaction of the filter media approximate 4 0 cm depth compaction was observed in both control and biochar zvi cells before the start of test 2 vadose zone water contents decreased for both cells before infiltration in test 4 by 5 7 on average compared to test 3 and was likely because of the 1 yr period between test 3 and 4 with no infiltration during each infiltration test as flow in each cell approached steady state the volumetric water contents in the control and biochar zvi cells increased and reached steady state values fig 2 there were no obvious changes in water content in the bottom 25 cm of each vadose zone after infiltration in test 2 after steady state flow conditions were reached the volumetric water content at the top 5 cm of the control cell was significantly higher than starting conditions and close to total porosity which was due to shallow ponded water in the mulch layer observed during test 2 after steady state infiltration the vadose zone of the biochar zvi cell retained 19 41 l 10 7 27 0 more water than the control cell in all tests table 3 the additional water retention in the biochar amended vadose zone is attributed to biochar intraparticle porosity 0 83 0 01se ml g biochar se one estimated standard error imhoff and nakhli 2017 and its influence on interparticle pore space the addition of biochar increased total porosity of the vadose zone from 0 42 0 01se control cell to 0 51 0 01se biochar zvi cell a 20 increase table 1 the br mass recoveries as reported in table 3 ranged from 81 to 89 for control and biochar zvi cells for tests 1 3 but decreased to 69 72 in test 4 the smaller mass recovery for test 4 is due to the approximately 73 1 less br input in test 4 which was insufficient to quantify the tailing of br breakthrough with a fixed br detection limit compare figs s2 and s3 in supporting information because br does not interact with zvi you et al 2005 zhang et al 2004 and is not sorbed to biochar significantly the 2 8 smaller br mass recovery in biochar zvi versus control for all tests is likely due to increased total pore volume pv after adding biochar and zvi table 1 the mrts of the biochar zvi cell determined from br transport table 3 were 0 88 and 0 70 h longer than the control cell in test 1 and 2 respectively representing a 12 4 and 10 5 increase the longer mrt is comparable to the increased residence time in biochar zvi versus control cell 1 11 h for test 1 and 0 58 h for test 2 calculated by the increased water retained in the vadose zone 38 and 19 l thus the vadose zone with biochar played a predominant role in residence time increase the mrt for the control cell in test 3 was 2 0 h less than that for the control cell in tests 1 and 2 even though hydraulic loadings were identical this may have been caused by severe preferential flow in the control cell in test 3 which is also demonstrated by the early br peak in the breakthrough curve fig s3 while insufficient information in br breakthrough curves in test 4 likely caused underestimation of mrts for test 4 table 3 the larger residence time in biochar zvi versus control cell would remain thus while residence times varied between the four experiments in all cases hydraulic residence times were greater in the biochar zvi than the control cell because biochar increased water retention 3 2 nitrate removal fig 3 shows the no3 n breakthrough curve and cumulative no3 n removal in tests 1 and 2 while peak influent no3 n concentrations were attenuated in the effluent from the control cell much more pronounced no3 n removal was observed in the biochar zvi cell furthermore both cells removed more nitrate in test 2 which is expected given the longer time for enrichment of denitrifying populations and higher ambient temperature in test 2 versus test 1 22 c versus 12 c cumulative no3 n removal for the control and biochar zvi cells fig 3b and d for tests 1 and 2 respectively both decreased during the 20 5 h following the pulse input the decreases in treatment efficiency were 42 59 in the control cell which were more rapid and pronounced compared to the 7 28 decreases in the biochar zvi cell although initial high removal in both cells is partially due to dilution with resident water after 1 pv of flow the biochar zvi cell maintained 84 0 and 96 6 of no3 n removal in test 1 and 2 respectively whereas no3 n removal in the control cell decreased to 26 8 and 83 4 overall the biochar zvi cell removed approximately 4 7 times 66 2 vs 14 2 and 1 6 times 92 8 vs 58 3 more no3 n than the control cell in tests 1 and 2 the biochar zvi cell maintained its better no3 n removal than the control cell in tests 3 and 4 fig s4 with 2 4 times more removal when total no3 n input was high 17 8 g in test 3 and with 1 1 times more removal when hydraulic load was low 2 7 cm h in test 4 noticeably the percent no3 n removal in test 3 decreased compared to test 2 from 58 3 to 29 6 for the control cell and 92 9 to 72 4 for the biochar zvi cell fig 4 however the no3 n mass removal in test 3 was more than 10 times higher than that in the other tests fig 5 which is due to the higher total no3 n input table 2 in test 3 the smaller percent no3 n removal in test 3 versus test 2 in the control cell might be due to preferential flow in test 3 that was indicated by early arrival of the peak tracer concentration fig s3 from the orp and do monitoring fig 6 discussed below the biochar zvi cell still provided more favorable conditions for denitrification than the control cell in test 4 the relatively small 10 improvement in removal by biochar zvi versus control is likely due to the high average vadose zone water content 0 34 and long residence time mrt 12 0 h in the control cell almost twice the mrts in tests 1 and 2 and three times that of test 3 while the control cell performed nearly as well as the biochar zvi cell in test 4 the hydraulic capacity of the control cell was approximately 50 smaller than the biochar zvi cell since infiltration rate was reduced fig 6 shows orp and do monitored at the vadose saturation zone interface and at the bottom of the saturation zone in test 2 the orp measurements indicated favorable conditions for denitrification in both cells although orp in the biochar zvi cell was significantly lower than the control cell the do concentrations were also smaller at both measurement depths in the biochar zvi versus the control cell similar results were observed for test 3 and 4 fig s5 overall the biochar zvi cell removed 10 370 more no3 n than the control cell in all tests which strongly demonstrates the ability of biochar zvi media to enhance no3 removal in bioretention systems compared to other bioretention cells with iws table 4 the biochar zvi cell showed higher no3 n removal despite high no3 n and hydraulic loading as well as the absence of plant uptake 3 3 effects of biochar on nitrate removal pore water samples at the vadose saturation zone interface are helpful to separate no3 n removal in these two regions the percent no3 n removal in each zone defined as the mass ratio of the no3 n removed in that zone to the total no3 n in the influent is shown in fig 4 and the corresponding no3 n mass reduction is shown in fig 5 compared to the control cell biochar amendment markedly enhanced no3 n removal in the vadose zone for all tests this significant no3 n removal caused by biochar is also illustrated by the no3 concentration profiles of the cell pore water and effluents which is shown in fig 7 for tests 1 and 2 as flow rate was constant throughout the tests the difference between the integrated area of influent and effluent concentrations of the control vadose zone region with diagonal lines in fig 7 represents i e is proportional to the cumulative no3 n removed in the control vadose zone the yellow area between the control and biochar zvi vadose zone concentrations represents the additional no3 n removed due to biochar in both tests 1 and 2 the yellow areas are larger than the diagonal areas supporting our hypothesis that biochar amendment enhances denitrification similar results were found using no3 n concentration data for test 3 fig s8 in test 4 despite high no3 n removal in the control cell indicated by the large diagonal line region biochar still contributed additional no3 n removal the greater no3 removal in the biochar amended vadose zone may be attributed to two mechanisms first by increasing both porosity and water saturation biochar increased the volumetric water content in the vadose zone which increased the residence time and the size of the low oxygen region for instance biochar increased total porosity by an average of 13 5 in the first two tests and the average water saturation from 65 to 73 in test 1 table 3 by increasing the water filled pore space biochar increased the residence time for denitrification reported above and the volume in the vadose zone that was conducive to anaerobic microbial activities such as denitrification further the oxygen content of this water was lower than in the control cell with no biochar fig 6 for tests 1 and 2 and fig s5 for tests 3 and 4 since volumetric water content was higher table 3 and diffusion paths within water longer several empirical modeling approaches describing denitrification in the subsurface use water saturation as a surrogate parameter to account for limiting oxygen conditions akhavan et al 2012 heinen 2006 huwe and totsche 1995 in these modeling studies changes in water saturation are used to modify in situ rates of denitrification consistent with observations in this study the 89 4 no3 n removal in the vadose zone of the control cell in test 4 largest of all control cell tests demonstrated that water saturation and mrt are crucial to no3 n removal because of compaction and material aging a hydraulic loading of 2 7 cm h was the maximum that could be maintained in the control cell which resulted in mrt that was twice or three times that of previous tests in the control cell while maintaining similarly high volumetric water contents table 3 that favor anaerobic conditions similar compaction and loss of hydraulic capacity was not observed in the biochar zvi cell only for test 4 was orp 0 for water collected from the control cell fig s5 in addition to increasing porosity and water saturation biochemically biochar could have promoted denitrification by serving as an electron donor for nitrate reducing bacteria using the same sr biochar as in this study saquing et al 2016 reported that biochar could be reduced or charged by serving as an electron acceptor for acetate oxidation and the reduced biochar then acted as an electron donor for no3 reduction by geobacter metallireducens the ability of biochar to serve as both electron donor and acceptor has been attributed to the redox facile hydro quinone groups in biochar that can undergo reversible electron donation and acceptance klüpfel et al 2014 saquing et al 2016 similarly biochar in the saturated region of the vadose zone could have been reduced prior to the tests by serving as an electron acceptor for microbial oxidation of organic carbon from mulch and soil mix the stored electrons in biochar could then be released to support autotrophic denitrification during the tests in test 3 the mean temperature and hydraulic load were the same as in test 2 while its total no3 n input was 14 times higher the effluent no3 n concentration from the control cell in test 3 was close to the influent concentration 22 5 mg l 6 h after tracer addition fig s4 and the control vadose zone only treated 2 9 g no3 n fig 5 on the other hand the effluent no3 n concentration from the biochar zvi cell was below 10 mg l during test 3 and 12 7 g no3 n was removed in the vadose zone with biochar the significantly higher no3 n removal capacity in test 3 versus test 2 may be due in part to the electrons stored in biochar that were involved in denitrification the microbial accessible electron donating and accepting capacity of sr biochar was shown to be 0 86 mmol g saquing et al 2016 assuming that all electrons for the additional no3 n removal up to 9 8 g in test 3 fig 5 came from biochar in the saturated region bottom 25 cm of the vadose zone and that all no3 n was converted into n2 i e 5 electrons nitrate up to 0 43 mmol g of electrons would have been derived from biochar for the enhanced denitrification which was well within the capacity of sr biochar there might be other effects of biochar that contributed to the no3 n removal in tests 1 4 such as no3 sorption onto biochar retention in biochar intrapore water ph alteration and release of dissolved organic carbon doc however these effects are likely limited yang et al 2017 reported limited no3 sorption on various biochars pyrolyzed from different biomass at different temperatures including a pinewood based biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c which is similar to sr biochar used in this study furthermore soil particles and clay minerals often show more no3 sorption than biochar on a mass basis yang et al 2017 in this study 147 kg of control soil was replaced by 25 kg of biochar in the biochar zvi cell thus even less no3 n sorption in the biochar zvi cell should be expected because total br recovery for the biochar zvi cell was at most 8 2 lower than that for the control cell over all tests the no3 n retained with water should be small ph was unlikely to account for the higher no3 n removal since the pore water ph in the vadose zone fig s6 of the control and biochar zvi cells were both in the favorable ph range of 5 5 8 0 for heterotrophic denitrifiers rivett et al 2008 finally the leachable doc from sr biochar was rather low 1 2 ppm saquing et al 2016 and negligible compared to the doc from mulch and sawdust neculita and zagury 2008 saquing et al 2016 as electron donor for denitrification doc monitored in test 4 fig s7 showed that doc concentrations in the effluent of the biochar zvi cell were lower than that of the control cell by a factor of 4 3 4 effects of zvi on nitrate removal in test 1 the control cell saturation zone removed 20 2 of the input no3 n however its denitrifying capacity was limited since little removal occurred after 8 h fig 7 in contrast approximately 0 7 mg l of no3 n was continuously removed in the saturation zone with zvi throughout test 1 with 1 8 times more no3 n removed than the control saturation zone this constant and sustained nitrate removal see fig 7 indicates that zvi in the saturation zone changed the capacity of denitrification in the iws this is consistent with our understanding of how zvi enhances denitrification during the pulse test anaerobic corrosion of zvi would continuously generate h2 and fe2 as electron donors to support autotrophic denitrification in the saturation zone resulting in a greater and more sustained no3 consumption however in test 2 the saturation zone with zvi removed less no3 n than the control which might be due to the significantly lower incoming no3 n concentration 0 22 0 70 mg l for the biochar zvi cell vs 0 72 2 02 mg l for the control cell from the upper layer with biochar amendment even with such low incoming concentrations the no3 n concentration was still further decreased to 0 1 mg l in the saturation zone with zvi it is reasonable to presume that the no3 n removal due to zvi would have been higher if entering no3 n concentrations had been the same for both saturation zones similar phenomena were seen in tests 3 and 4 and are presented in fig s8 although zvi consumption could result in less nitrate reduction the ph changes between biochar zvi vadose and saturation zones fig s6 suggest that the zvi in the saturation zone maintained a similar rate of corrosion after 18 months in addition to supporting microbial denitrification in test 1 zvi also reduced no3 n chemically forming 90 mg of nh4 n in the saturation zone fig s9 this produced nh4 n is equivalent to 12 8 of the total no3 n removed 700 mg in the saturation zone with zvi suggesting that no3 n removal in the saturation zone with zvi was approximately 13 abiotic and 87 microbial in test 1 in tests 2 4 the cumulative nh4 n mass decreased tests 2 and 3 or remained unchanged test 4 in the biochar zvi saturation zone fig s9 which indicates that abiotic nitrate reduction was minimal and no3 n removal was due to biotic denitrification biotic denitrification is more desirable than abiotic reduction as its end product is the innocuous and less bioavailable n2 nh4 n was observed to increase in pore water in the vadose zones for all tests except the control vadose zone in test 3 and nh4 n decreased or remained unchanged in saturation zones for all tests except the biochar zvi saturation zone in test 1 fig s9 although nh4 n was generated during tests in both cells the amount of nh4 n collected in the effluent accounted for less than 5 of the total input no3 n fig s10 decreasing the overall tn removal by 1 0 8 6 the mechanisms for nh4 n formation in pore water of bioretention cells should be examined in future work 4 conclusions during four stormwater infiltration tests over 18 months the biochar zvi cell showed greater water retention longer residence time and higher no3 n removal compared to the control cell biochar amendment in the vadose zone increased total porosity and water retention likely due to its abundant intrapores and influence on interparticle pore space biochar amended at the lower depth of the vadose zone that was nearly water saturated could have also served as an electron donor to enhance denitrification zvi amendment in the saturation zone provided further no3 n removal due to its reducing properties however the effect of zvi amendment on no3 n removal was only obvious in test 1 with the impact diminished in following tests biochar amendment in the vadose zone showed continued enhancement of no3 n removal in all experiments these results indicate that adding wood derived biochar to the vadose zone and zvi to the saturation zone can increase no3 n removal by 10 370 compared to conventional bioretention media in developed regions where installation of new stormwater treatment systems to achieve regulatory compliance is limited biochar and zvi amendments may provide additional treatment furthermore no3 n removal in this study resulted only from concentration reduction additional no3 n removal is expected when flow reduction and plant uptake are accounted for biochar amendment increased water retention by 11 27 and prevented clogging and loss of infiltration capacity thus enabling the biochar zvi system to treat more stormwater than a standard bioretention medium future work should evaluate the long term performance of biochar and zvi

19211,capacitive deionization cdi performance as measured by salt adsorption capacity sac and energy normalized adsorption of salt enas is frequently limited by anion repulsion at the positive electrode in this work we investigate the ability to prevent co ion repulsion by increasing complementary fixed charged within the electrode macropores by binding composite cdi electrodes with the ionically charged structural polysaccharides chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose when employing asymmetrically charged electrode binders co ion repulsion was prevented resulting in sac and enas values that were three times greater than composite electrodes bound with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and similar to cdi electrodes composed of chemically modified carbon polysaccharide binders did not modify the charge balance in the carbon micropores but did shift the discharge voltage of maximum adsorption enabling a shift in operating voltage that prolonged cycle lifetime without a significant loss in performance the mechanism of improved salt accumulation with polysaccharide binders was explored with a one dimensional model that integrated cdi and ion exchange membrane covered mcdi sub units model simulations indicate that carbon macropores covered with thin layers of charged polysaccharides increase adsorption by a sequential accumulation and release of salt to depleted uncovered pores graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination capacitive deionization structural polysaccharide binders chitosan carboxymethyl cellulose 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an electrochemical brackish water desalination technique that advantageously couples salt removal with electrochemical energy storage anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 in cdi influent saltwater flows between two polarized porous carbon electrodes to induce counter ion adsorption within electrical double layers edl and removal of salt from the bulk solution to regenerate adsorption capacity energy stored in the electrodes is discharged by reversing the flow of current releasing adsorbed salt to a brine stream the charge efficiency ce of a cdi cell defined as the ratio of adsorbed charge to applied charge is arguably the most important cell performance metric as it directly relates to salt adsorption capacity sac and energy normalized adsorption of salt enas hawks et al 2018 hemmatifar et al 2016 suss et al 2015 charge efficiency can be improved by introducing complementary fixed charge groups at the diffusion interface of the electrode or directly onto the

been added to the cdi electrode surface as directly cast iems jain et al 2018 kim and choi 2010c 2010b or polyelectrolyte layers ahualli et al 2017 however reducing film thickness negatively impacts co ion retention and charge efficiency due to reduced charge density of the polymer coating ahualli et al 2017 jain et al 2018 co ion repulsion can also be prevented by immobilizing chemical charge onto the carbon surface which modifies the micropore charge balance and promotes counter ion adsorption within the electric double layer biesheuvel et al 2015 gao et al 2016 2015 fixing charge on the carbon surface and coating electrode with iems improves performance but also increases system cost and global warming potential due to methodological reliance on strong acids and organic solvents yu et al 2016 fabricating composite cdi electrodes with crosslinked water soluble polymers could reduce chemical consumption and improve performance most cdi electrodes utilize a hydrophobic polymer such as poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf to bind activated carbon films in aqueous environments but pdvf requires organic solvents to be incorporated into the active material matrix porada et al 2013 replacing pvdf with crosslinked poly vinyl alcohol pva has been shown to not only reduce chemical use but increase specific capacitance due to increased wettability park et al 2011 crosslinking pva with charged polymers was recent shown to be an effective method of iem thin film synthesis 10 μm for mcdi electrodes jain et al 2018 water and weak acid soluble structural polysaccharides with fixed charge such as deacetylated chitosan cs and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc could potentially combine the benefits of water soluble binders and iems these polymers have been used as binders in li ion batteries to improve coulombic efficiency and cycling stability chai et al 2013 li et al 2007 but their use in cdi has yet to be explored in this work we evaluated the use of structural polysaccharide binders reduce chemical consumption and utilize the primary amines of cs pka 6 3 and carboxylic acid groups of cmc pka 3 0 to incorporate fixed charge within cdi electrode macrostructures desalination

holliston ma at 0 2 ml min while effluent salt concentration was measured with an in line conductivity probe edaq denistone east australia to evaluate the impact of each binder and carbon modified electrode desalination performance was characterized for six conditions divided into symmetric as received ac with pvdf cs and cmc binder and asymmetric as received ac with pvdf cmc binder cs cmc

reported data were collected under dynamic steady state after at least 5 cycles from average values over at least 3 consecutive cycles for replicate experiments conducted for each experimental condition 8 14 data points per condition for initial and ph variable desalination experiments electrodes were operated with 1 2 0 v charge discharge voltages with a half cycle time of 15 min to determine any expansion of operating window the discharge cell voltage was varied up to 1 2 v for the untreated carbon with asymmetrically charged binders as well as pvdf bound electrode

factor m f energy normalized absorbed salt enas was calculated as the amount of salt removed during desalination normalized to the total charging half cycle energy consumption hemmatifar et al 2016 2 7 equilibrium modeling of salt flux in cdi with and without charged binders to understand the impacts of the polysaccharide binders on ionic transport cdi cells composed of as received carbon electrodes were modeled using comsol multiphysics 5 3 desalination performance of ar pvdf electrodes were carried out first to calibrate the micropore charge balance of the as received carbon using the amphoteric donnan model adm incorporating asymmetry in the fixed chemical charge in the electrode micropores biesheuvel et al 2015 gao et al 2016 the differential equations were discretized adopting a central finite differences approximation at the interfaces which allowed treatment of the electrodes and flow channel as well mixed volumes the anode and cathode were assumed to be symmetric in terms of their mass porosity and fixed chemical charge the electrolyte was assumed to be binary and no other species were considered in the mass balances thus the ph remained constant and equal to the influent ph throughout the simulations faradaic reactions were only accounted for through the incorporation of a fixed leakage current which was determined experimentally shang et al 2017 to model the impact of the polysaccharide binders a cell where mcdi and cdi sub units were intercalated fig 1 b the mcdi sub units were modeled as published elsewhere tedesco et al 2017 2016 unlike a discrete iem positioned adjacent to the cdi electrode the polysaccharide binders are expected to form a much thinner selective layer and thus the membrane thickness of the mcdi sub units was decreased from 150 to 15 μm to resemble an actual coating table s1 also different from an actual iem is the charge density which is much lower for the charged binders a detailed description of the implemented models and the parameters used can be found in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon and electrode characterization as received oxidized and aminated powdered activated carbons were bound by pvdf chitosan or cmc with their pore volume and surface area being analyzed after electrode casting and drying the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and incremental pore volume distributions of the 5 different carbon binder compositions fig 2 a and b as well as pore volume analysis table 1 indicate that polysaccharide binders did not impact bet surface area average pore width or total pore volume the bet surface area for as received carbon was comparable previously reported values in composite electrode cdi systems 700 1200 m2 g 1 kim and choi 2010b wang et al 2012 zou et al 2008 a significant decrease in surface area and total pore volume occurred after acid treatment of ac can be seen which is consistent with literature moreno castilla et al 1995 wang et al 2007 the decline continued after amine modification of the oxidized carbon presumably due the ligation of the carbon with eda a boehm titration was utilized to determine the number of acidic and basic sites present on the pre and post modified ac table 2 lists the number of each surface site for each carbon and compares them to the maximum number of available amine and carboxylic acid groups present on chitosan and cmc all values being normalized to weight the increase in acidic groups via oxidation and increase in basic groups after subsequent amination are further indication of the successful surface treatment of the ac despite the lower normalized number of available charged functional groups between surface modified carbons and binders the higher proportion of active material versus binder in the electrode results in an overall higher charge density within the electrode however as there are several types of acidic functional groups on the carbon there is no guarantee that all will be deprotonated at the various operating ph values 3 2 effect of cs and cmc binders on desalination performance the polysaccharide binders increased electrode capacitance but did not impact the ac surface charge balance as indicated by pzc which was determined by the average minimum in anodic and cathodic capacitance fig 2c and d the observed increase in electrode capacitance for polysaccharide bound electrodes can likely be attributed to binder hydrophilicity which would increase the active carbon micropore volume as has been observed for other hydrophilic binders such as pva jain et al 2018 park et al 2011 the binder fixed charge groups did not incur higher contact resistance or lower capacitance due to excess water uptake as has been observed in a previous attempts to bind cdi electrodes with iems liu et al 2014 cv results for oxidized and aminated carbon confirm surface charge modification as indicated by shifts in electrode pzc and improved capacitance within positive and negative polarization windows respectively fig 2d while polysaccharide binders had a marginal influence electrode pore volume capacitance or pzc fig 2 the inclusion of secondary amine and carboxylate groups within the electrode macrostructure had a profound impact on desalination performance fig 3 the profiles for the symmetric configurations in which both the anode and cathode are comprised of ar pvdf ar cs and ar cmc did not show favorable desalination performance a co ion repulsion peak is observed for the ar pvdf configuration indicating an unfavorable abundance of charged groups in the as received carbon micropores fig 3a comparing the concentration profiles of symmetrically bound electrode pairs indicates that increasing anode fixed negative charge with cmc has a more pronounced impact on the desalination behavior than increasing positive charge at the cathode with cs this is likely due to the presence of carboxylate groups on the surface of the pristine carbon which promotes cation adsorption and facilitates co ion repulsion when used as a positive electrode material biesheuvel et al 2015 the effect of unfavorable charge of both ar pvdf and ar cs anodes can be directly observed in the low charge efficiency observed in experiments containing those electrodes table 3 operating cdi cells with asymmetric charge orientation prevented co ion repulsion and improved desalination performance the relative impact of each charged binder can be observed in the two asymmetric cells with as received carbon fig 3d and e when an ar cmc cathode was operated with an ar pvdf anode co ion repulsion was eliminated and the minimum concentration decreased which lead to moderate increases in observed charge efficiency and salt adsorption table s3 because all cells were operated under identical flow conditions for the same charging length the calculated flow efficiency 94 was identical across all electrode combinations therefore all charge efficiency increases can be attributed to double layer faradaic efficiencies hawks et al 2018 when amine functional groups were introduced in the anode electrode ar cs ar cmc desalination performance increased by nearly three fold fig 3e and table 1 highlighting the importance of co ion retention at the anode electrode unique features can be observed in the desalination profile of the asymmetric charged binder cell fig 3e including a rise and fall of effluent concentration after then initial spike in desalination followed by a prolonged period where the effluent concentration gradually approached the influent baseline the underlying mechanisms of these features are explored with model simulations in section 3 5 despite differences in carbon surface chemistry and electrode pzc values the two asymmetrically charged cdi cells cs cmc binders vs am ox carbon with neutral binder showed comparable improvements in ce sac and enas table 2 table s3 both asymmetrical binder and modified carbon cell pairs approached ce and sac ranges typically reported for mcdi 0 7 0 9 and 5 13 mg g 1 respectively kim and choi 2010c 2010d liu et al 2014 r zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 salt adsorption and electronic charge transfer profiles for each asymmetrically charged electrode pair configuration fig 4 reveal that mechanisms of deionization are distinct for each of the asymmetrically charged systems salt adsorption in asymmetric binder cell ar cs ar cmc increases rapidly within the first 60 s then transitions to a linear increase in the low current density portion of the charge cycle implying that two mechanisms contribute to salt removal low current salt adsorption coupled with unchanged electrode pzc fig 2c indicates that polysaccharide binder charge groups provide increased sac similar to mcdi while representing less than 10 of the electrode mass it is possible that the initial adsorbed salt could be attributed to covered macropores and the remaining salt could be attributed to uncovered macropores however relative increases in sac for charged binder systems are most significantly realized when charging time is greater than 300 s fig 4a in contrast salt adsorption for the symmetric and asymmetric carbon electrodes bound by pvdf electrode show a similar high current dependent salt adsorption profile but differed significantly in magnitude the charged binder system had the highest enas because fixing charge in the electrode macro structure improved ion selectivity without increasing energy input fig 4b which cannot be said for the am ox carbon system the cs cmc asymmetric cell also operated at ce values that are 20 30 greater than previous attempts to bind cdi cells with ion exchange polymers liu et al 2014 park et al 2011 an improvement of this degree could mean that the polysaccharide binders not only provide structural support to the composite electrode but also provide more macropore coverage than ion exchange polymers with hydrophobic backbones 3 3 influence of ph on various electrode configurations since the charged acidic and basic groups on the polysaccharide binders are weak pka between 2 and 12 the various electrode configurations were examined across a ph range from 5 to 9 as expected the asymmetric binder electrode configuration performed best at a ph of 5 where both binders were more than one ph unit from their pka values fig 5 and declined as ph increased nearly converging with the ar pvdf cell configuration at a ph of 8 the steep drop in sac and ce with increasing ph can be attributed to the deprotonation of the chitosan amine groups and exposure of carbon acidic group which negatively impact chloride adsorption at the anode to increase amine pka chitosan could be potentially be crosslinked with glutaraldehyde to form tertiary amines jeon and höll 2003 or a quaternary amine could be grafted to the backbone banu and meenakshi 2017 sowmya and meenakshi 2013 the asymmetric carbon configuration was the only electrode pair tested that maintained improved desalination performance across all tested ph values the modified carbon cdi cell exhibited more stable performance than the cs cmc cell this can be attributed to the difference in electrode pzc maintained by the oxidized cathode since the aminated carbon exhibited a more positive pzc and capacitance below the ar control at ph 9 fig s1b 3 4 improved cycling stability in charged binders it has been demonstrated that surface modification of carbon leads to an expanded potential operating window enabling enhanced deionization by discharging at the pzc of the cell gao et al 2016 to examine whether the same was true for charged binders discharge potentials were varied and sac values were determined for the ar cs ar cmc configuration and compared to am pvdf ox pvdf and ar pvdf ar pvdf despite not modifying the carbon micropore charge balance and shifting pzc the cs cmc cell configuration expanded the charge discharge cell potential window of maximum salt adsorption by 0 4 v from 1 2 to 1 6 v fig 6 a similar trends were also observed for enas and charge efficiency fig s3 however the expanded cell potential window only marginally increased salt adsorption from 14 1 to 15 5 mg g 1 the discharge potential of maximum adsorption for the cdi cell with modified carbon 0 6 v aligned well with the cell pzc determined from cyclic voltammetry but not for the charged binder cell 0 v figs 6a and 2c d implying that cs and cmc helped retain co ions during discharged at negative potentials conversely the data indicated that the operating potential of asymmetric charged binder cell could be shifted toward lower potentials without significantly reducing sac extended cycling was performed at two charge discharge cell potentials to evaluate if cdi cells with asymmetric charged binders could maintain enhanced performance while extending cycle life at a lower charging voltage asymmetrically charged cells am pvdf ox pvdf and ar cs ar cmc and the as received carbon with neutral binder ar pvdf ar pvdf were run for over 100 cycles at both 1 2 0 v and 0 8 0 4 v cycling the discharge potential was selected to maintain the 1 2 v potential difference between charge and discharge while aligning with the discharge potential of peak salt adsorption for the asymmetrically charged binder electrode pair condition for all electrode combinations 1 2 0 v cycling the most commonly utilized voltage regime for cdi operation led to the rapid degradation of sac after 100 cycles fig 6b the rapid decline of sac associated with 1 2 0 v cycling is likely due to parasitic reactions occurring on the electrode surface at greater cell voltage avraham et al 2011 hemmatifar et al 2016 tang et al 2017 after 1 2 0 v cycling the pzc of all anodes ar pvdf am pvdf ar cs shifted positively due to an increase in micropore acidic groups figs s2a c e the byproduct of carbon oxidation the anode cvs also appeared more resistive indicating that carbon corrosion could increase contact resistance across all electrode types there was not a substantial change in capacitance before and after 0 8 0 4 v and 0 1 2 v cycling fig s2 by shifting the operating window to lower charging voltages all electrode types can then be operated to reduce the occurrence of parasitic processes such as oxygen or water reduction at the cathode and carbon corrosion at the anode when the operating potential window was shifted 0 8 0 4 v sac decreased but stabilized within 10 of the initial capacity for all configurations fig 5b confirming previous findings of gao et al that shifting operating potential can preserve cdi performance gao et al 2015 the sac of the charged binder electrode pair decreased with charging voltage but remained significantly higher than electrodes composed of unmodified carbon and bound with pvdf fig 5b the sac of the asymmetric charged binder electrode pairs electrode pairs when cycled at 0 8 0 4 v were marginally lower than electrode pairs with modified carbon 70 and 100 of 1 2 0 v sac respectively which is expected considering the charged binders do not shift the cell pzc in such as case reduction in charging voltage lowers the cell capacitance but it nonetheless remains much higher than electrodes composed of the same carbon bound by pvdf 30 of 1 2 0 v sac this suggests charged binders offer a means to extend electrode lifetimes through changing operating voltages while simultaneously preserving sac 3 5 theoretical understanding of ionic transport in polysaccharide bound electrodes the experimental data presented above indicate that asymmetrically charged polysaccharide binders enhance cdi performance by retaining co ions within the macropores of composite electrodes and that multiple mechanisms may contribute to salt adsorption to illustrate the effects of the improved electrode macrostructure provided by charged polysaccharide binders we modeled a hybrid architecture composed of cdi and mcdi sub units assuming a symmetric electrode arrangement we first fit the untreated carbon data using the amphoteric donnan model adm gao et al 2016 to calibrate the acidic 0 26 m and basic 0 01 m surface groups on the as received carbon table s1 the discrepancy between experimentally determined and model calibrated acidic and basic group concentrations for the as received carbon indicate that basic groups were oxidized during cycling the shift in pzc observed for as received carbon anodes charged at 1 2 v for 100 cycles fig s2 provides complementary evidence for the calibrated imbalance if fixed charged groups the sac value calculated for this system differed by 8 from that obtained experimentally and charge efficiency shows a similar trend fig 7 a the small co ion repulsion peak is a result of employing a dirichlet boundary condition at the beginning of the cell c c o instead of a danckwert s type and omitting the addition of a mixing volume at the beginning of the cell however the drop in micropore concentration for anode acidic groups at the onset of charging confirms the source of co ion repulsion fig 7b to simulate impact of charged binders on ionic transport within the anode electrode macropores mcdi sub units were introduced in parallel fig 7d f and serial arrangement fig 7g i simulations of the hybrid architecture indicate that enhanced salt flux at the onset of charge can be attributed to covered macropores at the electrode surface at a mcdi surface coverage of 5 we observe the co ion repulsion peak disappear and flow channel effluent concentration drop rapidly fig 7d when the membrane thickness was reduced from 150 to 15 μm the rate of desalination increased dramatically indicating that the diffusion timescale across the thin selective interface was significantly reduced and governs the concentration in the flow channel for subsequent units the model discretizes rapid transport across these selective interfaces and slower transport across traditional cdi sub units resulting in a sequential desalination profile elucidating the potential cause of the increase and decrease in concentration below the baseline that was observed in the experimental data fig 7d however only the mcdi sub unit with a thick membrane caused an increase in sac due to salt retention within the macropores fig 7e while the behavior resembles the experimental data simulated desalination performance of the parallel cdi mcdi architecture does predict a significant enhancement of sac or ce since there is no mixing between parallel mcdi and cdi sub units and the membrane charge density is low the macro and micropore concentrations in the mcdi cell initially increase then return to the influent value as salt diffuses from the covered macropores back to the flow channel fig 7d and e the charge density of the membrane is not high enough to prevent back diffusion due to the significant concentration gradient established shortly after charging which is exacerbated by the abundance of acidic groups in the anode micropores and limited macropore volume for salt storage however this approach fails to represent reality because the mcdi sub units operated independently from the cdi sub units in previously published mcdi models it is transport across the membrane what governs the rate of transport dykstra et al 2017 2016 which might not be the case for a selective layer the thickness of a polysaccharide coating where membrane thickness has been reported to be as low as 10 μm jain et al 2018 this led us to analyze the effect of incorporating an mcdi unit within the electrode by splitting its volume into two equal mcdi cdi sub units in series in the x direction connecting a mcdi sub unit serially with a cdi sub unit led to a significant improvement in desalination since the cdi sub unit was positioned at the flow channel interface ions will enter the electrode at a rate dictated by the non selective interface as a result the simulated desalination profile is shallow but broad fig 7g providing further evidence that covered macropores in contact with the flow channel are responsible for increasing desalination rate fig 7d while the rate of salt removal was lower for the embedded cdi architecture the transport of ions between the mcdi and cdi sub units allowed counter ions diffusing from the mcdi sub unit back toward the flow channel to be adsorbed by the cdi unit this led to less initial salt accumulation in the mcdi micro and macropores and delayed saturation of the cdi micropores fig 7h and i therefore it is possible to conclude that the unique desalination behavior of asymmetric charged polysaccharide binder cdi cells is a product of different transport processes within and at the electrode surface and is caused by beneficial flux between covered and uncovered macropores 4 conclusions these result show that the charged structural polysaccharides chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose can effectively enhance desalination by incorporating fixed charge within composite electrode macropores without compromising capacitance or structural integrity in aqueous environments in comparison to iems and modified carbon charged polysaccharide binders also provide significant environmental and cost benefits associated water and weak acid solvency based on simulations charged binders enhance salt adsorption via rapid accumulation of ions within polysaccharide covered macropores to improve model fidelity and track transport of ions between covered and open pores future efforts should include tracking fluxes of

19211,capacitive deionization cdi performance as measured by salt adsorption capacity sac and energy normalized adsorption of salt enas is frequently limited by anion repulsion at the positive electrode in this work we investigate the ability to prevent co ion repulsion by increasing complementary fixed charged within the electrode macropores by binding composite cdi electrodes with the ionically charged structural polysaccharides chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose when employing asymmetrically charged electrode binders co ion repulsion was prevented resulting in sac and enas values that were three times greater than composite electrodes bound with polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and similar to cdi electrodes composed of chemically modified carbon polysaccharide binders did not modify the charge balance in the carbon micropores but did shift the discharge voltage of maximum adsorption enabling a shift in operating voltage that prolonged cycle lifetime without a significant loss in performance the mechanism of improved salt accumulation with polysaccharide binders was explored with a one dimensional model that integrated cdi and ion exchange membrane covered mcdi sub units model simulations indicate that carbon macropores covered with thin layers of charged polysaccharides increase adsorption by a sequential accumulation and release of salt to depleted uncovered pores graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination capacitive deionization structural polysaccharide binders chitosan carboxymethyl cellulose 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi is an electrochemical brackish water desalination technique that advantageously couples salt removal with electrochemical energy storage anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 in cdi influent saltwater flows between two polarized porous carbon electrodes to induce counter ion adsorption within electrical double layers edl and removal of salt from the bulk solution to regenerate adsorption capacity energy stored in the electrodes is discharged by reversing the flow of current releasing adsorbed salt to a brine stream the charge efficiency ce of a cdi cell defined as the ratio of adsorbed charge to applied charge is arguably the most important cell performance metric as it directly relates to salt adsorption capacity sac and energy normalized adsorption of salt enas hawks et al 2018 hemmatifar et al 2016 suss et al 2015 charge efficiency can be improved by introducing complementary fixed charge groups at the diffusion interface of the electrode or directly onto the

been added to the cdi electrode surface as directly cast iems jain et al 2018 kim and choi 2010c 2010b or polyelectrolyte layers ahualli et al 2017 however reducing film thickness negatively impacts co ion retention and charge efficiency due to reduced charge density of the polymer coating ahualli et al 2017 jain et al 2018 co ion repulsion can also be prevented by immobilizing chemical charge onto the carbon surface which modifies the micropore charge balance and promotes counter ion adsorption within the electric double layer biesheuvel et al 2015 gao et al 2016 2015 fixing charge on the carbon surface and coating electrode with iems improves performance but also increases system cost and global warming potential due to methodological reliance on strong acids and organic solvents yu et al 2016 fabricating composite cdi electrodes with crosslinked water soluble polymers could reduce chemical consumption and improve performance most cdi electrodes utilize a hydrophobic polymer such as poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf to bind activated carbon films in aqueous environments but pdvf requires organic solvents to be incorporated into the active material matrix porada et al 2013 replacing pvdf with crosslinked poly vinyl alcohol pva has been shown to not only reduce chemical use but increase specific capacitance due to increased wettability park et al 2011 crosslinking pva with charged polymers was recent shown to be an effective method of iem thin film synthesis 10 μm for mcdi electrodes jain et al 2018 water and weak acid soluble structural polysaccharides with fixed charge such as deacetylated chitosan cs and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc could potentially combine the benefits of water soluble binders and iems these polymers have been used as binders in li ion batteries to improve coulombic efficiency and cycling stability chai et al 2013 li et al 2007 but their use in cdi has yet to be explored in this work we evaluated the use of structural polysaccharide binders reduce chemical consumption and utilize the primary amines of cs pka 6 3 and carboxylic acid groups of cmc pka 3 0 to incorporate fixed charge within cdi electrode macrostructures desalination

factor m f energy normalized absorbed salt enas was calculated as the amount of salt removed during desalination normalized to the total charging half cycle energy consumption hemmatifar et al 2016 2 7 equilibrium modeling of salt flux in cdi with and without charged binders to understand the impacts of the polysaccharide binders on ionic transport cdi cells composed of as received carbon electrodes were modeled using comsol multiphysics 5 3 desalination performance of ar pvdf electrodes were carried out first to calibrate the micropore charge balance of the as received carbon using the amphoteric donnan model adm incorporating asymmetry in the fixed chemical charge in the electrode micropores biesheuvel et al 2015 gao et al 2016 the differential equations were discretized adopting a central finite differences approximation at the interfaces which allowed treatment of the electrodes and flow channel as well mixed volumes the anode and cathode were assumed to be symmetric in terms of their mass porosity and fixed chemical charge the electrolyte was assumed to be binary and no other species were considered in the mass balances thus the ph remained constant and equal to the influent ph throughout the simulations faradaic reactions were only accounted for through the incorporation of a fixed leakage current which was determined experimentally shang et al 2017 to model the impact of the polysaccharide binders a cell where mcdi and cdi sub units were intercalated fig 1 b the mcdi sub units were modeled as published elsewhere tedesco et al 2017 2016 unlike a discrete iem positioned adjacent to the cdi electrode the polysaccharide binders are expected to form a much thinner selective layer and thus the membrane thickness of the mcdi sub units was decreased from 150 to 15 μm to resemble an actual coating table s1 also different from an actual iem is the charge density which is much lower for the charged binders a detailed description of the implemented models and the parameters used can be found in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon and electrode characterization as received oxidized and aminated powdered activated carbons were bound by pvdf chitosan or cmc with their pore volume and surface area being analyzed after electrode casting and drying the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and incremental pore volume distributions of the 5 different carbon binder compositions fig 2 a and b as well as pore volume analysis table 1 indicate that polysaccharide binders did not impact bet surface area average pore width or total pore volume the bet surface area for as received carbon was comparable previously reported values in composite electrode cdi systems 700 1200 m2 g 1 kim and choi 2010b wang et al 2012 zou et al 2008 a significant decrease in surface area and total pore volume occurred after acid treatment of ac can be seen which is consistent with literature moreno castilla et al 1995 wang et al 2007 the decline continued after amine modification of the oxidized carbon presumably due the ligation of the carbon with eda a boehm titration was utilized to determine the number of acidic and basic sites present on the pre and post modified ac table 2 lists the number of each surface site for each carbon and compares them to the maximum number of available amine and carboxylic acid groups present on chitosan and cmc all values being normalized to weight the increase in acidic groups via oxidation and increase in basic groups after subsequent amination are further indication of the successful surface treatment of the ac despite the lower normalized number of available charged functional groups between surface modified carbons and binders the higher proportion of active material versus binder in the electrode results in an overall higher charge density within the electrode however as there are several types of acidic functional groups on the carbon there is no guarantee that all will be deprotonated at the various operating ph values 3 2 effect of cs and cmc binders on desalination performance the polysaccharide binders increased electrode capacitance but did not impact the ac surface charge balance as indicated by pzc which was determined by the average minimum in anodic and cathodic capacitance fig 2c and d the observed increase in electrode capacitance for polysaccharide bound electrodes can likely be attributed to binder hydrophilicity which would increase the active carbon micropore volume as has been observed for other hydrophilic binders such as pva jain et al 2018 park et al 2011 the binder fixed charge groups did not incur higher contact resistance or lower capacitance due to excess water uptake as has been observed in a previous attempts to bind cdi electrodes with iems liu et al 2014 cv results for oxidized and aminated carbon confirm surface charge modification as indicated by shifts in electrode pzc and improved capacitance within positive and negative polarization windows respectively fig 2d while polysaccharide binders had a marginal influence electrode pore volume capacitance or pzc fig 2 the inclusion of secondary amine and carboxylate groups within the electrode macrostructure had a profound impact on desalination performance fig 3 the profiles for the symmetric configurations in which both the anode and cathode are comprised of ar pvdf ar cs and ar cmc did not show favorable desalination performance a co ion repulsion peak is observed for the ar pvdf configuration indicating an unfavorable abundance of charged groups in the as received carbon micropores fig 3a comparing the concentration profiles of symmetrically bound electrode pairs indicates that increasing anode fixed negative charge with cmc has a more pronounced impact on the desalination behavior than increasing positive charge at the cathode with cs this is likely due to the presence of carboxylate groups on the surface of the pristine carbon which promotes cation adsorption and facilitates co ion repulsion when used as a positive electrode material biesheuvel et al 2015 the effect of unfavorable charge of both ar pvdf and ar cs anodes can be directly observed in the low charge efficiency observed in experiments containing those electrodes table 3 operating cdi cells with asymmetric charge orientation prevented co ion repulsion and improved desalination performance the relative impact of each charged binder can be observed in the two asymmetric cells with as received carbon fig 3d and e when an ar cmc cathode was operated with an ar pvdf anode co ion repulsion was eliminated and the minimum concentration decreased which lead to moderate increases in observed charge efficiency and salt adsorption table s3 because all cells were operated under identical flow conditions for the same charging length the calculated flow efficiency 94 was identical across all electrode combinations therefore all charge efficiency increases can be attributed to double layer faradaic efficiencies hawks et al 2018 when amine functional groups were introduced in the anode electrode ar cs ar cmc desalination performance increased by nearly three fold fig 3e and table 1 highlighting the importance of co ion retention at the anode electrode unique features can be observed in the desalination profile of the asymmetric charged binder cell fig 3e including a rise and fall of effluent concentration after then initial spike in desalination followed by a prolonged period where the effluent concentration gradually approached the influent baseline the underlying mechanisms of these features are explored with model simulations in section 3 5 despite differences in carbon surface chemistry and electrode pzc values the two asymmetrically charged cdi cells cs cmc binders vs am ox carbon with neutral binder showed comparable improvements in ce sac and enas table 2 table s3 both asymmetrical binder and modified carbon cell pairs approached ce and sac ranges typically reported for mcdi 0 7 0 9 and 5 13 mg g 1 respectively kim and choi 2010c 2010d liu et al 2014 r zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 salt adsorption and electronic charge transfer profiles for each asymmetrically charged electrode pair configuration fig 4 reveal that mechanisms of deionization are distinct for each of the asymmetrically charged systems salt adsorption in asymmetric binder cell ar cs ar cmc increases rapidly within the first 60 s then transitions to a linear increase in the low current density portion of the charge cycle implying that two mechanisms contribute to salt removal low current salt adsorption coupled with unchanged electrode pzc fig 2c indicates that polysaccharide binder charge groups provide increased sac similar to mcdi while representing less than 10 of the electrode mass it is possible that the initial adsorbed salt could be attributed to covered macropores and the remaining salt could be attributed to uncovered macropores however relative increases in sac for charged binder systems are most significantly realized when charging time is greater than 300 s fig 4a in contrast salt adsorption for the symmetric and asymmetric carbon electrodes bound by pvdf electrode show a similar high current dependent salt adsorption profile but differed significantly in magnitude the charged binder system had the highest enas because fixing charge in the electrode macro structure improved ion selectivity without increasing energy input fig 4b which cannot be said for the am ox carbon system the cs cmc asymmetric cell also operated at ce values that are 20 30 greater than previous attempts to bind cdi cells with ion exchange polymers liu et al 2014 park et al 2011 an improvement of this degree could mean that the polysaccharide binders not only provide structural support to the composite electrode but also provide more macropore coverage than ion exchange polymers with hydrophobic backbones 3 3 influence of ph on various electrode configurations since the charged acidic and basic groups on the polysaccharide binders are weak pka between 2 and 12 the various electrode configurations were examined across a ph range from 5 to 9 as expected the asymmetric binder electrode configuration performed best at a ph of 5 where both binders were more than one ph unit from their pka values fig 5 and declined as ph increased nearly converging with the ar pvdf cell configuration at a ph of 8 the steep drop in sac and ce with increasing ph can be attributed to the deprotonation of the chitosan amine groups and exposure of carbon acidic group which negatively impact chloride adsorption at the anode to increase amine pka chitosan could be potentially be crosslinked with glutaraldehyde to form tertiary amines jeon and höll 2003 or a quaternary amine could be grafted to the backbone banu and meenakshi 2017 sowmya and meenakshi 2013 the asymmetric carbon configuration was the only electrode pair tested that maintained improved desalination performance across all tested ph values the modified carbon cdi cell exhibited more stable performance than the cs cmc cell this can be attributed to the difference in electrode pzc maintained by the oxidized cathode since the aminated carbon exhibited a more positive pzc and capacitance below the ar control at ph 9 fig s1b 3 4 improved cycling stability in charged binders it has been demonstrated that surface modification of carbon leads to an expanded potential operating window enabling enhanced deionization by discharging at the pzc of the cell gao et al 2016 to examine whether the same was true for charged binders discharge potentials were varied and sac values were determined for the ar cs ar cmc configuration and compared to am pvdf ox pvdf and ar pvdf ar pvdf despite not modifying the carbon micropore charge balance and shifting pzc the cs cmc cell configuration expanded the charge discharge cell potential window of maximum salt adsorption by 0 4 v from 1 2 to 1 6 v fig 6 a similar trends were also observed for enas and charge efficiency fig s3 however the expanded cell potential window only marginally increased salt adsorption from 14 1 to 15 5 mg g 1 the discharge potential of maximum adsorption for the cdi cell with modified carbon 0 6 v aligned well with the cell pzc determined from cyclic voltammetry but not for the charged binder cell 0 v figs 6a and 2c d implying that cs and cmc helped retain co ions during discharged at negative potentials conversely the data indicated that the operating potential of asymmetric charged binder cell could be shifted toward lower potentials without significantly reducing sac extended cycling was performed at two charge discharge cell potentials to evaluate if cdi cells with asymmetric charged binders could maintain enhanced performance while extending cycle life at a lower charging voltage asymmetrically charged cells am pvdf ox pvdf and ar cs ar cmc and the as received carbon with neutral binder ar pvdf ar pvdf were run for over 100 cycles at both 1 2 0 v and 0 8 0 4 v cycling the discharge potential was selected to maintain the 1 2 v potential difference between charge and discharge while aligning with the discharge potential of peak salt adsorption for the asymmetrically charged binder electrode pair condition for all electrode combinations 1 2 0 v cycling the most commonly utilized voltage regime for cdi operation led to the rapid degradation of sac after 100 cycles fig 6b the rapid decline of sac associated with 1 2 0 v cycling is likely due to parasitic reactions occurring on the electrode surface at greater cell voltage avraham et al 2011 hemmatifar et al 2016 tang et al 2017 after 1 2 0 v cycling the pzc of all anodes ar pvdf am pvdf ar cs shifted positively due to an increase in micropore acidic groups figs s2a c e the byproduct of carbon oxidation the anode cvs also appeared more resistive indicating that carbon corrosion could increase contact resistance across all electrode types there was not a substantial change in capacitance before and after 0 8 0 4 v and 0 1 2 v cycling fig s2 by shifting the operating window to lower charging voltages all electrode types can then be operated to reduce the occurrence of parasitic processes such as oxygen or water reduction at the cathode and carbon corrosion at the anode when the operating potential window was shifted 0 8 0 4 v sac decreased but stabilized within 10 of the initial capacity for all configurations fig 5b confirming previous findings of gao et al that shifting operating potential can preserve cdi performance gao et al 2015 the sac of the charged binder electrode pair decreased with charging voltage but remained significantly higher than electrodes composed of unmodified carbon and bound with pvdf fig 5b the sac of the asymmetric charged binder electrode pairs electrode pairs when cycled at 0 8 0 4 v were marginally lower than electrode pairs with modified carbon 70 and 100 of 1 2 0 v sac respectively which is expected considering the charged binders do not shift the cell pzc in such as case reduction in charging voltage lowers the cell capacitance but it nonetheless remains much higher than electrodes composed of the same carbon bound by pvdf 30 of 1 2 0 v sac this suggests charged binders offer a means to extend electrode lifetimes through changing operating voltages while simultaneously preserving sac 3 5 theoretical understanding of ionic transport in polysaccharide bound electrodes the experimental data presented above indicate that asymmetrically charged polysaccharide binders enhance cdi performance by retaining co ions within the macropores of composite electrodes and that multiple mechanisms may contribute to salt adsorption to illustrate the effects of the improved electrode macrostructure provided by charged polysaccharide binders we modeled a hybrid architecture composed of cdi and mcdi sub units assuming a symmetric electrode arrangement we first fit the untreated carbon data using the amphoteric donnan model adm gao et al 2016 to calibrate the acidic 0 26 m and basic 0 01 m surface groups on the as received carbon table s1 the discrepancy between experimentally determined and model calibrated acidic and basic group concentrations for the as received carbon indicate that basic groups were oxidized during cycling the shift in pzc observed for as received carbon anodes charged at 1 2 v for 100 cycles fig s2 provides complementary evidence for the calibrated imbalance if fixed charged groups the sac value calculated for this system differed by 8 from that obtained experimentally and charge efficiency shows a similar trend fig 7 a the small co ion repulsion peak is a result of employing a dirichlet boundary condition at the beginning of the cell c c o instead of a danckwert s type and omitting the addition of a mixing volume at the beginning of the cell however the drop in micropore concentration for anode acidic groups at the onset of charging confirms the source of co ion repulsion fig 7b to simulate impact of charged binders on ionic transport within the anode electrode macropores mcdi sub units were introduced in parallel fig 7d f and serial arrangement fig 7g i simulations of the hybrid architecture indicate that enhanced salt flux at the onset of charge can be attributed to covered macropores at the electrode surface at a mcdi surface coverage of 5 we observe the co ion repulsion peak disappear and flow channel effluent concentration drop rapidly fig 7d when the membrane thickness was reduced from 150 to 15 μm the rate of desalination increased dramatically indicating that the diffusion timescale across the thin selective interface was significantly reduced and governs the concentration in the flow channel for subsequent units the model discretizes rapid transport across these selective interfaces and slower transport across traditional cdi sub units resulting in a sequential desalination profile elucidating the potential cause of the increase and decrease in concentration below the baseline that was observed in the experimental data fig 7d however only the mcdi sub unit with a thick membrane caused an increase in sac due to salt retention within the macropores fig 7e while the behavior resembles the experimental data simulated desalination performance of the parallel cdi mcdi architecture does predict a significant enhancement of sac or ce since there is no mixing between parallel mcdi and cdi sub units and the membrane charge density is low the macro and micropore concentrations in the mcdi cell initially increase then return to the influent value as salt diffuses from the covered macropores back to the flow channel fig 7d and e the charge density of the membrane is not high enough to prevent back diffusion due to the significant concentration gradient established shortly after charging which is exacerbated by the abundance of acidic groups in the anode micropores and limited macropore volume for salt storage however this approach fails to represent reality because the mcdi sub units operated independently from the cdi sub units in previously published mcdi models it is transport across the membrane what governs the rate of transport dykstra et al 2017 2016 which might not be the case for a selective layer the thickness of a polysaccharide coating where membrane thickness has been reported to be as low as 10 μm jain et al 2018 this led us to analyze the effect of incorporating an mcdi unit within the electrode by splitting its volume into two equal mcdi cdi sub units in series in the x direction connecting a mcdi sub unit serially with a cdi sub unit led to a significant improvement in desalination since the cdi sub unit was positioned at the flow channel interface ions will enter the electrode at a rate dictated by the non selective interface as a result the simulated desalination profile is shallow but broad fig 7g providing further evidence that covered macropores in contact with the flow channel are responsible for increasing desalination rate fig 7d while the rate of salt removal was lower for the embedded cdi architecture the transport of ions between the mcdi and cdi sub units allowed counter ions diffusing from the mcdi sub unit back toward the flow channel to be adsorbed by the cdi unit this led to less initial salt accumulation in the mcdi micro and macropores and delayed saturation of the cdi micropores fig 7h and i therefore it is possible to conclude that the unique desalination behavior of asymmetric charged polysaccharide binder cdi cells is a product of different transport processes within and at the electrode surface and is caused by beneficial flux between covered and uncovered macropores 4 conclusions these result show that the charged structural polysaccharides chitosan and carboxymethyl cellulose can effectively enhance desalination by incorporating fixed charge within composite electrode macropores without compromising capacitance or structural integrity in aqueous environments in comparison to iems and modified carbon charged polysaccharide binders also provide significant environmental and cost benefits associated water and weak acid solvency based on simulations charged binders enhance salt adsorption via rapid accumulation of ions within polysaccharide covered macropores to improve model fidelity and track transport of ions between covered and open pores future efforts should include tracking fluxes of individual ions including protons and hydroxide within a two dimensional modeling framework acknowledgments this work was funded by the us national science foundation award no 1605290 entitled suschem

biocathode microbiome and resistome to continuous electrical stimulation especially args network interactions are poorly understood here using highthroughput functional gene array geochip v4 6 and illumina 16s rrna gene miseq sequencing the structure composition diversity and network interactions of cap reducing biocathode microbiome and resistome in response to continuous electrical stimulation were investigated our results indicate that the cap bioelectroreduction process could significantly accelerate the elimination of antibacterial activity of cap during cap containing wastewater treatment compared to the pure bioreduction process continuous electrical stimulation could obviously alter both the microbiome and resistome structures and consistently decrease the phylogenetic functional and overall args diversity and network complexity within the cap reducing biofilms the relative abundances of overall args and specific cap resistance related major facilitator superfamily mfs transporter genes were significantly negatively correlated with the reduction efficiency of cap to inactive antibacterial product amcl partially dechlorinated aromatic amine which may reduce the ecological risk associated with the evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and args during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment process this study offers new insights into the

2015 van boeckel et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 2017 the deep elimination of emerging antibiotic contaminants with high efficiency and low cost ways towards different water environments is one of the important goals and scientific frontiers in ensuring the global water safety eggen et al 2014 larsen et al 2016 pruden 2014 the microbial dominated biotechnology has the advantages of environmental friendliness and low operating costs and it is a commonly used technology all over the world van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 yun et al 2017b however on one hand traditional biological treatment systems have been confined by their low detoxification transformation efficiency and instability for these toxic emerging contaminants gonzalez gil et al 2016 tran et al 2016 on the other hand the biological treatment method is not only referred to the degradation attenuation process of antibiotic contaminants but also associated with the args transmission evolution and dynamic changes aydin et al 2015 liu et al 2012 varela et al 2014 recent findings have indicated that most args could not be efficiently removed by traditional anaerobic digestion treatment christgen et al 2015 ju et al 2016 yang et al 2014 as a result wastewater treatment plants are hotspots for the release of antibiotics and transmission of diverse antibiotic resistance bacteria arb as well as args into various environments christou et al 2017 czekalski et al 2014 guo et al 2017a michael et al 2013 undoubtedly activated sludge microbiome is the core element that associated with antibiotic biodegradation biotransformation during wastewater biological treatment therefore how to stimulate the anaerobic sludge microbiome and how to develop bioaugmented treatment technologies are central issues in environmental biotechnology for the enhanced treatment of high risk antibiotic wastewater bioelectrochemical systems bes employing electrode respiring microbiomes to catalyze oxidative reactions in anode or reductive reactions in cathode respectively have attracted growing attention in recent decades jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2011 yun et al 2017a 2018 bioelectrochemical treatment of various antibiotic contaminants including chloramphenicol cap nitrofurazone cefazolin oxytetracycline otc and sulfamethoxazole smx with acclimated biocathode or bioanode microbiomes have been extensively studied electrical stimulation could significantly enhance these enriched electrode biofilm microbiomes for the degradation transformation of antibiotic contaminants cheng et al 2016 kong et al 2017 liang et al 2013 2016 wang et al 2016 yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 2018 recent works have uncovered the specific args and mobile genetic elements profile in several antibiotics cap smx or otc degrading electrode microbiomes using traditional or high throughput quantitative pcr guo et al 2017b 2018 yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 guo et al found that the higher cap concentration less negative cathode potential or lower salinity enhanced the expression of cap resistance genes e g flor and cmla and other args inti1 and sul1 during the bioelectrochemical reduction bioelectroreduction of cap guo et al 2017b 2018 yan et al found that the number of args and the normalized copy number of specific tetracycline tc and sulfonamide resistance genes in otc degrading anode biofilms were both lower than those in conventional anaerobic reactors yan et al 2018 in another study the target smx and tc associated args in the biocathode were present at higher concentrations than those in the bioanode of the smx and tc treating up flow bioelectrochemical reactors zhang et al 2016 generally antibiotics could trigger the cross resistance of other antibiotic classes for example cap is able to induce the cross resistance to fluoro quinolones e g norfloxacin and nalidixic acid tc β lactams e g ampicillin cephalothin and penicillin g rifampicin or vancomycin in bacteria cohen et al 1989 george and levy 1983 gould et al 2004 therefore it is necessary to explore the changes in the diversity and abundance of other antibiotic classes resistance genes during the specific antibiotic biodegradation process however the response of overall resistome of the specific antibiotics degrading electrode microbiome to continuous electrical stimulation remains poorly understood the objectives of this study were to determine i whether continuous electrical stimulation could significantly enhance the bioelectroreduction of cap to inactive antibacterial product amcl partially dechlorinated aromatic amine ii whether continuous electrical stimulation could obviously alter phylogenetic and functional microbiome structure diversity and network interactions especially the resistome profile and network interactions of cap reducing biofilms and iii whether the enhanced cap bioelectroreduction process could dramatically lower the diversity abundance and network complexity of overall args our results suggest that the cap bioelectroreduction process could accelerate the elimination of antibacterial activity of cap during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment comparing to the traditional bioreduction process which may reduce the ecological risks of evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and novel args this study offers new insights into the response of an antibiotic reducing biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation and provides useful information on the assessment of overall args risk for the bioelectrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioelectrochemical reactors setup the dual chamber bes reactor was configured as described previously kong et al 2015 with graphite fiber brush as both anode and cathode 2 5 cm in diameter and 2 5 cm in length and a ag agcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she bioanalytical systems inc west lafayette in u s as the reference electrode a high precision resistor 10 ω with the external power 0 5 v in series was employed for the connection the electrode is filled in the bioreactor and is substantially in full contact with the catholyte approximately 28 ml the concentration gradient between the electrode and the catholyte is small and mass transfer is not the main limiting factor of the reaction the anodic and cathodic potentials were recorded every 10 min by a data acquisition system keithley 2700 keithley co ltd u s which were automatically converted to current according to ohm law all of the potential data reported herein were against she twelve bioelectrochemical reactors were started up with 0 5 v voltage supply bioanode provides approximately 0 50 v voltage vs ag agcl reference electrode bioanalytical systems inc west lafayette in u s thus the biocathode potential is around 0 8 v vs she the detailed bioanode establishment process was specifically described in a previous study wang et al 2011 to establish the biocathode bes the cathode chamber was filled with a mixture of the acclimated cap reducing consortium by inoculating the sludge from a wastewater treatment plant norman u s and catholyte 0 31 g l nh4cl 0 1 g l kcl 10 ml l wolf s vitamins 10 ml l wolf s trace elements 0 5 g l glucose 30 mg l cap 50 mm phosphate buffered saline ph 7 at 1 3 v v and incubated for 4 d with the applied voltage of 0 5 v subsequently the cathode liquid content was discharged and the cathode chamber was replenished with a fresh mixture this procedure was repeated for four times to achieve the development of biofilm on the cathode liang et al 2013 afterwards 12 bioreactors with biocathode mode were operated for one fed batch cycle under consistent operational condition then 6 bioreactors continued to run under power supply mode termed closed circuit biocathode cbiocathode and another 6 bioreactors performed without power supply under open circuit mode named open circuit biocathode obiocathode the cbiocathode and obiocathode biofilms were established with the same initial inoculation and under consistent operational condition the temperature 25 1 c throughout the experiment was maintained in a constant temperature incubator all the bioreactors performed 34 cycles to reach the stable state with the cap reduction efficiency as an indicator 2 2 geochip hybridization 16s rrna gene sequencing and data analysis a detailed description of the dna extraction dna purity and quantity determination pcr amplification 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing geochip hybridization and data analysis were carried out according to a previous study liang et al 2016 the detailed information for the used primers was described in si table s1 six cbiocathode and obiocathode biofilms respectively were selected for geochip hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis extracted dna 1 0 μg from each sample was labeled with cy 3 dye and then hybridized with geochip v4 6 as described previously tu et al 2014 the spots with signal to noise ratios snr lower than 2 were removed before statistical analysis the analysis of the raw data from 16s rrna gene sequencing was described elsewhere qu et al 2015 microbial functional gene and phylogenetic diversity indices including richness detected functional gene or identified otu numbers in each sample shannon weaver index h and simpson reciprocal 1 d were calculated according to a previous study liang et al 2016 detrended correspondence analysis dca pearson correlation analysis three nonparametric tests multiple response permutation procedure mrpp permutational multivariate analysis of variance adonis and analysis of similarity anosim were calculated using r v 3 2 5 hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using cluster v3 0 and visualized by treeview liang et al 2016 all functional genes detected in at least 3 out of 6 biological replicates were used for further statistical analysis differences between treatments were statistically analyzed by the two tailed unpaired t test 2 3 network construction with random matrix theory based approach and network analysis to elucidate microbial functional gene and arg interactions in the cap reducing biofilm microbiomes in response to continuous electrical stimulation two groups of phylogenetic functional and arg molecular ecological networks mens were constructed via random matrix theory based interface approach in men analysis pipeline mena http ieg2 ou edu mena deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2010 2011 the whole process was described in previous studies deng et al 2012 feng et al 2017 phylogenetic mens were constructed based on the identified otus from 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing and functional mens were constructed based on the detected bacterial functional genes involving in antibiotic resistance organic remediation electron transfer and carbon nitrogen sulphur cycling processes from geochip hybridization analysis specific arg mens were constructed based on the detected args from geochip hybridization analysis six biological replicates were used for three kinds of network analysis network properties including r2 of power law average connectivity average path length average clustering coefficient and modularity were all calculated in mena pipeline deng et al 2012 table 1 the constructed networks for the cbiocathode and obiocathode biofilms were visualized using cytoscape 3 3 0 software shannon et al 2003 2 4 chemicals and analytical methods cap 98 purity and high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo u s other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade effluent samples taken from the cathodic chamber within 50 h were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter before chemical analysis the concentrations of cap the cap transformation products amcl2 the nitro group reduced product of cap amcl the partially dechlorinated product of amcl2 cap acetyl acetylation of 3 hydroxyl of cap to form cap acetyl were measured using a reverse phase hplc system agilent 1200 series u s liang et al 2013 the cap transformation products were identified by a hplc ms as described elsewhere kong et al 2015 liang et al 2013 the cap reduction efficiency ercap was evaluated based on the difference between influent and effluent cap concentrations 3 results 3 1 biocathode reactors performance an abiotic cathode control group is crucial for the conclusion that the biocathode group significantly enhanced the reduction of cap the abiotic cathode treatment results showed that cap reduction and product amcl formation efficiencies were both significantly lower than the biocathode treatment group fig s1 which is consistent with our previous conclusions liang et al 2013 2016 therefore this study mainly focused on the cap reduction efficiency overall microbiome and antibiotic resistome characteristics of the cap reducing biocathode in response to continuous electrical stimulation after inoculating the cap reducing consortium for four times cathodic biofilms were established after 400 h during the biofilm establishment process the cathode potential kept approximately 0 80 v with the applied cell voltage of 0 5 v before the disconnection of the six biocathode reactors the ercap and aromatic amine products amcl and amcl2 formation efficiency were very close in the tested 12 biocathode reactors divided into two groups in the first cycle fig 1 no significant difference was found at any time nodes for the cap reduction and amcl formation fig s2 moreover the biocathode potential of the divided two groups at the first cycle were both kept at approximately 0 80 v vs she fig s2 these results confirmed the performances consistency of the 12 biocathode reactors under same operational mode when disconnecting the circuit of the six tested bioreactors termed as open circuit biocathode obiocathode the closed circuit biocathode group simplified as cbiocathode had a significantly higher ercap within 6 or 13 h than that of the obiocathode from the 2nd cycle to the 34th cycle fig 1 the cbiocathode produced obviously more dechlorinated aromatic amine product amcl from cap reduction than that of the obiocathode within 50 h consistently the obiocathode markedly accumulated the aromatic amine product amcl2 and slightly dechlorinated amcl2 to amcl fig 2 additionally the obiocathode significantly accumulated more cap acetyl product compared with that in the cbiocathode at all the operational cycles from the 2nd to the 34th cycle fig 2 indicating the bioelectroreduction reaction could weaken the non redox cap acetylation resistant process these results well indicate that the biocathodic catalysis is able to enhance the bioelectroreduction of cap to the antibacterial inactive aromatic amine products amcl and amcl2 3 2 overall responses of the biocathode functional and phylogenetic microbiome to continuous electrical stimulation to examine the effect of continuous electrical stimulation on the functional gene and phylogenetic diversity structure and composition of the biocathode microbiomes 12 cbiocathode and obiocathode biofilms 6 for each were analyzed using high throughput metagenomics tools microarray geochip v4 6 and 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing platform dca combined with three nonparametric dissimilarity tests mrpp adonis and anosim adequately indicated that continuous electrical stimulation significantly p 0 05 altered the functional genes and phylogenetic structure of cap reducing biofilms fig s3 and table s2 the overall diversity of the biocathode microbiomes was relatively lower at functional genes level and significantly lower at phylogenetic level p 0 005 upon continuous electrical stimulation based on the richness h and 1 d compared with those of the obiocathode microbiomes fig s3 suggesting continuous electrical stimulation condition has enriched a relatively simple biocathode microbiome 3 3 overall responses of biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation in total 3334 probes targeting 11 arg families were included in geochip v4 6 covering 5533 coding sequences a total of 654 args were detected in 12 cbiocathode and obiocathode resistomes hierarchical clustering analysis of these args showed that 5 out of 6 obiocathode resistomes were separated from 6 cbiocathode resistomes fig 3 a six arg groups could be visualized in the heat map and 90 args from groups 3 and 4 were exclusively enriched in the obiocathode however only 12 args in group 6 were unique in the cbiocathode a total of 113 arg genes accounting for 17 28 of all the detected args were absolutely undetected in the cbiocathode but detected at least in three obiocathode resistomes table s3 meanwhile a total of 29 args accounting for 4 43 of all the detected args were absolutely undetected in the obiocathode resistome but detected at least in 3 cbiocathode resistomes table s4 the obiocathode enriched 3 9 times higher unique args than the cbiocathode these unique args from the obiocathode mainly belong to small multidrug resistance protein smr 38 05 β lactamase 21 24 and major facilitator superfamily efflux pump membrane fusion protein mfs 17 70 categories relative abundance 15 the args from the shared and other groups showed no significant difference between the two resistomes fig 3b in addition 53 42 and 29 19 of the shared args amount to 161 args belong to the transporter and β lactamase subcategories respectively dca also showed the significant structure difference between the cbiocathode and obiocathode resistomes fig 3c three nonparametric dissimilarity tests mrpp adonis and anosim based on the two indices of jaccard and bray curtis together also indicated that the continuous electrical stimulation dramatically altered the cap reducing biocathode resistome structure p 0 005 table s2 the overall args diversity of the cbiocathode resistomes was marginally lowered upon the continuous electrical stimulation based on the richness h and 1 d indices p 0 10 compared to those of the obiocathode resistomes fig 3d this indicates that the persistent electrons donor of electrode could shape a relatively simple biocathode resistome 3 4 differences of args abundance at different families the cbiocathode showed lower gene abundance of the total antibiotic resistance p 0 094 smr p 0 061 and mfs p 0 048 than those of the obiocathode fig 4 a total of 122 mfs genes accounting for 2 20 of all the detected functional genes were detected in this study twenty mfs genes were absolutely undetected in 6 cbiocathode resistomes accounting for 16 39 but detected at least in 3 obiocathode resistomes comparatively only 4 mfs genes accounting for 3 28 were absolutely undetected in 6 obiocathode resistomes but appeared at least in 3 cbiocathode resistomes other arg categories were also showed relatively lower abundance in the cbiocathode than those in the obiocathode fig 4 pearson correlation analysis was used to explore whether the enhanced cap bioelectroreduction process could potentially minimize the enrichment of args in the biofilm microbiomes the results showed that total abundances of all detected args r 0 51 p 0 087 smr genes r 0 56 p 0 058 mfs genes r 0 59 p 0 042 and abc transporter genes r 0 50 p 0 096 were negatively correlated with amcl yield while smr genes r 0 49 p 0 101 mfs genes r 0 592 p 0 087 and abc genes r 0 51 p 0 094 were also negatively correlated with cap reduction efficiency fig 5 3 5 effects of electrical stimulation on the overall network structure and interactions to understand the effect of electrical stimulation on the biofilm network interactions from phylogenetic and functional genes perspectives phylogenetic and functional mens were constructed based on the identified 1566 otus from 16s rrna gene sequencing and 15636 functional genes detected from geochip hybridization analysis respectively the major topological properties of phylogenetic and functional networks were summarized table 1 and fig s5 based on the network size the number of otus or genes in a network namely node number and total link number the overall network complexity at phylogenetic and functional genes levels were both significantly higher under pure anaerobic condition obiocathode than under electrical stimulation condition cbiocathode specifically compared to the obiocathode the phylogenetic mens of the cbiocathode generally had significantly shorter path lengths higher clustering efficiencies and less modules table 1 which are key network properties in terms of system efficiency and robustness zhou et al 2010 2011 to better understand the interactions among different phyla and gene categories the two networks were visualized figs s4 and s5 taken the phylogenetic mens for example the impact of continuous electrical stimulation on the biofilm network structure and composition could be seen from phylum level the majority of the nodes in these two networks belonged to 11 phyla fig s4 among them proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and euryarchaeota were more dominant under electrical stimulation the relative proportions of firmicutes and euryarchaeota in the network enriched considerably while the percentage of proteobacteria decreased substantially fig s4 these results strongly suggest that continuous electrical stimulation could obviously affect the overall architecture of the mens in the cap reducing biofilms and consistently decrease the overall network complexity 3 6 effects of electrical stimulation on the resistome network structure and interactions to understand the arg interactions within the cbiocathode and obiocathode resistomes arg mens were constructed based on the detected 654 args from geochip hybridization analysis the cbiocathode and obiocathode resistomes were analyzed and the major topological properties of arg networks were summarized table 1 the overall topology indices showed that the network connectivity distributions fitted with the power law model r2 of power law from 0 639 to 0 720 to better understand the interactions among different arg families the two networks were visualized the majority of the nodes in these two networks belonged to 4 arg groups mfs β lactamase smr and tet the impact of continuous electrical stimulation on the biofilm resistome network structure could be seen from the arg family level among them smr and β lactamase genes showed more node number and proportion both in the cbiocathode and obiocathode followed by mfs and tet fig 6 and fig s6 based on the node number the network complexity for all arg families was generally higher under pure anaerobic condition obiocathode than under electrical stimulation condition cbiocathode although the relative proportions of most arg families were not obviously different between the cbiocathode and obiocathode fig s5 the obiocathode resistome had a more complex and quite different network structure than the cbiocathode resistome based on the average connectivity avgk from 2 402 to 2 966 node numbers from 209 to 294 and link numbers from 633 to 957 table 1 specifically the obiocathode resistome had significantly more total positive 691 vs 473 and negative 266 vs 160 links than those of the cbiocathode resistome fig s6 more positive correlations imply the co existence of diverse args during the bioreduction of cap for modules property a total of 14 modules with 5 nodes were obtained for the obiocathode networks while the cbiocathode networks had 4 modules with 5 nodes fig 6 we also further analyzed the mfs genes networks property because cap resistance genes mainly belong to this family and it showed obviously lower gene abundances in the cbiocathode than that of the obiocathode p 0 05 the number of mfs nodes and total links in the networks obviously decreased 1 90 and 2 18 times respectively upon continuous electrical stimulation moreover whether it is the cbiocathode or the obiocathode the proportion of positive links is greater 70 collectively the arg networks had considerably smaller network size significantly lower connectivity shorter path lengths and lower clustering efficiencies under continuous electrical stimulation than under no electrical stimulation consistent to the phylogenetic and functional mens continuous electrical stimulation also obviously altered the resistome network structure and impacted the network interactions among various arg families and markedly decreased the resistome network complexity in the anaerobic cap reducing biofilm system 4 discussion understanding the fate and profile of overall resistome during the biological treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater is a central issue for the water ecological safety assessment recent studies largely focused on the fate of the selected antibiotic associated args but not overall args during the bioelectrochemical treatment of different antibiotic contaminants guo et al 2017b 2018 yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 concretely zhang et al found that the target smx and tc args suli sulii suliii teta tetc teto tetq and tetw in the lower biocathode were present at a higher concentration than in the upper bioanode of the smx and tc treating up flow bess which is consistent with the bioanode zone showed the higher antibiotic removal efficiency than that of the biocathode zone zhang et al 2016 guo et al investigated the fate of args such as cap flor and cmla smx suli and tc tetc resistance as well as mobile genetic element integrase inti1 encoding genes during the bioelectroreduction of cap in the biocathode under different operational modes a higher cap concentration 20 mg l and 50 mg l compared to 10 mg l and less negative cathode potential 0 5 v vs she with the lowest cap reduction efficiency compared to that of the 1 25 v and 1 0 v operational modes enhanced the expression of cap resistance genes e g flor and cmla guo et al 2017b these results suggest that the enhanced antibiotic reduction could reduce the relative abundances of the specific args in the functional electrode respiring biofilms guo et al 2017b yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 which also agreed with that high antibiotic residual generally could increase the args abundance within anaerobic bioreactors guo et al 2017c interestingly guo et al also uncovered the distinct responses of representative args abundance of cap reducing biocathode to salinity gradient the relative abundances of cmla flor inti1 and sul1 under low salinity group 0 5 were significantly higher than those of the control and high salinity group 2 and 6 although the control 88 3 and high 6 salinity group 49 5 showed lower cap reduction efficiency than that of the low 0 5 salinity group 92 5 differently the relative abundance of tetc significantly increased as salinity increased guo et al 2018 however the response of overall resistome of the involved electrode associated multispecies biofilms especially the network structure and interactions to continuous electrical stimulation has not yet been reported using a comprehensive functional gene microarray geochip which contains 3334 probes targeting 11 arg families this study examined the cap reducing cathode biofilm resistomes under continuous electrical stimulation and analyzed the overall args structure composition diversity abundance and network interactions of the biocathode microbiomes with the pure anaerobic biofilm microbiomes as the control to understand how the biofilm resistome respond to continuous electrical stimulation during cap reduction the results showed that the overall cbiocathode and obiocathode resistome structures were significantly different and the relative abundances of various arg families especially mfs transporter genes which cover cap resistance genes e g flor cmla fexa fexb and pexa li et al 2013 were obviously lower in the cbiocathode than those in the obiocathode moreover the relative abundance of mfs genes was marginally or significantly negatively correlated with cap reduction efficiency r 0 592 p 0 087 and amcl yield r 0 59 p 0 042 in addition the cap bioelectroreduction reaction can also weaken the non redox cap acetylation resistant process based on the chemical data fig 2a the enhanced bioelectroreduction of cap to amcl appeared to exert smaller antibiotic selection pressure on the cbiocathode microbiomes and finally resulted in a significantly lower total args abundance especially for specific cap associated mfs genes more importantly continuous electrical stimulation could consistently decrease the phylogenetic functional and overall args diversity and network complexity within the cap reducing biofilms these results highlight that continuous electrical stimulation could minimize the possibility of evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and novel args by accelerating antibiotic detoxification during antibiotics containing wastewater treatment this information may be useful for the assessment of overall args risk for the bioelectrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants 5 conclusions the cap bioelectroreduction process can significantly accelerate the elimination of antibacterial activity of cap during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment compared to the pure bioreduction process continuous electrical stimulation obviously altered the resistome structure and decreased the args diversity abundance and network complexity within the cap reducing biocathode microbiomes the relative abundance of cap resistance associated mfs transporter genes was significantly negatively correlated with the reduction efficiency of cap to amcl these results strongly suggest that such a process has its advantage over conventional anaerobic treatment process on the minimization of the evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and args by accelerating antibiotic detoxification during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment this study offers new insights into the response of an antibiotics reducing biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation and provides potentially useful information for the assessment of overall args risk for the bioelectrochemical treatment of

of cap guo et al 2017b 2018 yan et al found that the number of args and the normalized copy number of specific tetracycline tc and sulfonamide resistance genes in otc degrading anode biofilms were both lower than those in conventional anaerobic reactors yan et al 2018 in another study the target smx and tc associated args in the biocathode were present at higher concentrations than those in the bioanode of the smx and tc treating up flow bioelectrochemical reactors zhang et al 2016 generally antibiotics could trigger the cross resistance of other antibiotic classes for example cap is able to induce the cross resistance to fluoro quinolones e g norfloxacin and nalidixic acid tc β lactams e g ampicillin cephalothin and penicillin g rifampicin or vancomycin in bacteria cohen et al 1989 george and levy 1983 gould et al 2004 therefore it is necessary to explore the changes in the diversity and abundance of other antibiotic classes resistance genes during the specific antibiotic biodegradation process however the response of overall resistome of the specific antibiotics degrading electrode microbiome to continuous electrical stimulation remains poorly understood the objectives of this study were to determine i whether continuous electrical stimulation could significantly enhance the bioelectroreduction of cap to inactive antibacterial product amcl partially dechlorinated aromatic amine ii whether continuous electrical stimulation could obviously alter phylogenetic and functional microbiome structure diversity and network interactions especially the resistome profile and network interactions of cap reducing biofilms and iii whether the enhanced cap bioelectroreduction process could dramatically lower the diversity abundance and network complexity of overall args our results suggest that the cap bioelectroreduction process could accelerate the elimination of antibacterial activity of cap during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment comparing to the traditional bioreduction process which may reduce the ecological risks of evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and novel args this study offers new insights into the response of an antibiotic reducing biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation and provides useful information on the assessment of overall args risk for the bioelectrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioelectrochemical reactors setup the dual chamber bes reactor was configured as described previously kong et al 2015 with graphite fiber brush as both anode and cathode 2 5 cm in diameter and 2 5 cm in length and a ag agcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she bioanalytical systems inc west lafayette in u s as the reference electrode a high precision resistor 10 ω with the external power 0 5 v in series was employed for the connection the electrode is filled in the bioreactor and is substantially in full contact with the catholyte approximately 28 ml the concentration gradient between the electrode and the catholyte is small and mass transfer is not the main limiting factor of the reaction the anodic and cathodic potentials were recorded every 10 min by a data acquisition system keithley 2700 keithley co ltd u s which were automatically converted to current according to ohm law all of the potential data reported herein were against she twelve bioelectrochemical reactors were started up with 0 5 v voltage supply bioanode provides approximately 0 50 v voltage vs ag agcl reference electrode bioanalytical systems inc west lafayette in u s thus the biocathode potential is around 0 8 v vs she the detailed bioanode establishment process was specifically described in a previous study wang et al 2011 to establish the biocathode bes the cathode chamber was filled with a mixture of the acclimated cap reducing consortium by inoculating the sludge from a wastewater treatment plant norman u s and catholyte 0 31 g l nh4cl 0 1 g l kcl 10 ml l wolf s vitamins 10 ml l wolf s trace elements 0 5 g l glucose 30 mg l cap 50 mm phosphate buffered saline ph 7 at 1 3 v v and incubated for 4 d with the applied voltage of 0 5 v subsequently the cathode liquid content was discharged and the cathode chamber was replenished with a fresh mixture this procedure was repeated for four times to achieve the development of biofilm on the cathode liang et al 2013 afterwards 12 bioreactors with biocathode mode were operated for one fed batch cycle under consistent operational condition then 6 bioreactors continued to run under power supply mode termed closed circuit biocathode cbiocathode and another 6 bioreactors performed without power supply under open circuit mode named open circuit biocathode obiocathode the cbiocathode and obiocathode biofilms were established with the same initial inoculation and under consistent operational condition the temperature 25 1 c throughout the experiment was maintained in a constant temperature incubator all the bioreactors performed 34 cycles to reach the stable state with the cap reduction efficiency as an indicator 2 2 geochip hybridization 16s rrna gene sequencing and data analysis a detailed description of the dna extraction dna purity and quantity determination pcr amplification 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing geochip hybridization and data analysis were carried out according to a previous study liang et al 2016 the detailed information for the used primers was described in si table s1 six cbiocathode and obiocathode biofilms respectively were selected for geochip hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis extracted dna 1 0 μg from each sample was labeled with cy 3 dye and then hybridized with geochip v4 6 as described previously tu et al 2014 the spots with signal to noise ratios snr lower than 2 were removed before statistical analysis the analysis of the raw data from 16s rrna gene sequencing was described elsewhere qu et al 2015 microbial functional gene and phylogenetic diversity indices including richness detected functional gene or identified otu numbers in each sample shannon weaver index h and simpson reciprocal 1 d were calculated according to a previous study liang et al 2016 detrended correspondence analysis dca pearson correlation analysis three nonparametric tests multiple response permutation procedure mrpp permutational multivariate analysis of variance adonis and analysis of similarity anosim were calculated using r v 3 2 5 hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using cluster v3 0 and visualized by treeview liang et al 2016 all functional genes detected in at least 3 out of 6 biological replicates were used for further statistical analysis differences between treatments were statistically analyzed by the two tailed unpaired t test 2 3 network construction with random matrix theory based approach and network analysis to elucidate microbial functional gene and arg interactions in the cap reducing biofilm microbiomes in response to continuous electrical stimulation two groups of phylogenetic functional and arg molecular ecological networks mens were constructed via random matrix theory based interface approach in men analysis pipeline mena http ieg2 ou edu mena deng et al 2012 zhou et al 2010 2011 the whole process was described in previous studies deng et al 2012 feng et al 2017 phylogenetic mens were constructed based on the identified otus from 16s rrna gene illumina sequencing and functional mens were constructed based on the detected bacterial functional genes involving in antibiotic resistance organic remediation electron transfer and carbon nitrogen sulphur cycling processes from geochip hybridization analysis specific arg mens were constructed based on the detected args from geochip hybridization analysis six biological replicates were used for three kinds of network analysis network properties including r2 of power law average connectivity average path length average clustering coefficient and modularity were all calculated in mena pipeline deng et al 2012 table 1 the constructed networks for the cbiocathode and obiocathode biofilms were visualized using cytoscape 3 3 0 software shannon et al 2003 2 4 chemicals and analytical methods cap 98 purity and high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo u s other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade effluent samples taken from the cathodic chamber within 50 h were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter before chemical analysis the concentrations of cap the cap transformation products amcl2 the nitro group reduced product of cap amcl the partially dechlorinated product of amcl2 cap acetyl acetylation of 3 hydroxyl of cap to form cap acetyl were measured using a reverse phase hplc system agilent 1200 series u s liang et al 2013 the cap transformation products were identified by a hplc ms as described elsewhere kong et al 2015 liang et al 2013 the cap reduction efficiency ercap was evaluated based on the difference between influent and effluent cap concentrations 3 results 3 1 biocathode reactors performance an abiotic cathode control group is crucial for the conclusion that the biocathode group significantly enhanced the reduction of cap the abiotic cathode treatment results showed that cap reduction and product amcl formation efficiencies were both significantly lower than the biocathode treatment group fig s1 which is consistent with our previous conclusions liang et al 2013 2016 therefore this study mainly focused on the cap reduction efficiency overall microbiome and antibiotic resistome characteristics of the cap reducing biocathode in response to continuous electrical stimulation after inoculating the cap reducing consortium for four times cathodic biofilms were established after 400 h during the biofilm establishment process the cathode potential kept approximately 0 80 v with the applied cell voltage of 0 5 v before the disconnection of the six biocathode reactors the ercap and aromatic amine products amcl and amcl2 formation efficiency were very close in the tested 12 biocathode reactors divided into two groups in the first cycle fig 1 no significant difference was found at any time nodes for the cap reduction and amcl formation fig s2 moreover the biocathode potential of the divided two groups at the first cycle were both kept at approximately 0 80 v vs she fig s2 these results confirmed the performances consistency of the 12 biocathode reactors under same operational mode when disconnecting the circuit of the six tested bioreactors termed as open circuit biocathode obiocathode the closed circuit biocathode group simplified as cbiocathode had a significantly higher ercap within 6 or 13 h than that of the obiocathode from the 2nd cycle to the 34th cycle fig 1 the cbiocathode produced obviously more dechlorinated aromatic amine product amcl from cap reduction than that of the obiocathode within 50 h consistently the obiocathode markedly accumulated the aromatic amine product amcl2 and slightly dechlorinated amcl2 to amcl fig 2 additionally the obiocathode significantly accumulated more cap acetyl product compared with that in the cbiocathode at all the operational cycles from the 2nd to the 34th cycle fig 2 indicating the bioelectroreduction reaction could weaken the non redox cap acetylation resistant process these results well indicate that the biocathodic catalysis is able to enhance the bioelectroreduction of cap to the antibacterial inactive aromatic amine products amcl and amcl2 3 2 overall responses of the biocathode functional and phylogenetic microbiome to continuous electrical stimulation to examine the effect of continuous electrical stimulation on the functional gene and phylogenetic diversity structure and composition of the biocathode microbiomes 12 cbiocathode and obiocathode biofilms 6 for each were analyzed using high throughput metagenomics tools microarray geochip v4 6 and 16s rrna gene illumina miseq sequencing platform dca combined with three nonparametric dissimilarity tests mrpp adonis and anosim adequately indicated that continuous electrical stimulation significantly p 0 05 altered the functional genes and phylogenetic structure of cap reducing biofilms fig s3 and table s2 the overall diversity of the biocathode microbiomes was relatively lower at functional genes level and significantly lower at phylogenetic level p 0 005 upon continuous electrical stimulation based on the richness h and 1 d compared with those of the obiocathode microbiomes fig s3 suggesting continuous electrical stimulation condition has enriched a relatively simple biocathode microbiome 3 3 overall responses of biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation in total 3334 probes targeting 11 arg families were included in geochip v4 6 covering 5533 coding sequences a total of 654 args were detected in 12 cbiocathode and obiocathode resistomes hierarchical clustering analysis of these args showed that 5 out of 6 obiocathode resistomes were separated from 6 cbiocathode resistomes fig 3 a six arg groups could be visualized in the heat map and 90 args from groups 3 and 4 were exclusively enriched in the obiocathode however only 12 args in group 6 were unique in the cbiocathode a total of 113 arg genes accounting for 17 28 of all the detected args were absolutely undetected in the cbiocathode but detected at least in three obiocathode resistomes table s3 meanwhile a total of 29 args accounting for 4 43 of all the detected args were absolutely undetected in the obiocathode resistome but detected at least in 3 cbiocathode resistomes table s4 the obiocathode enriched 3 9 times higher unique args than the cbiocathode these unique args from the obiocathode mainly belong to small multidrug resistance protein smr 38 05 β lactamase 21 24 and major facilitator superfamily efflux pump membrane fusion protein mfs 17 70 categories relative abundance 15 the args from the shared and other groups showed no significant difference between the two resistomes fig 3b in addition 53 42 and 29 19 of the shared args amount to 161 args belong to the transporter and β lactamase subcategories respectively dca also showed the significant structure difference between the cbiocathode and obiocathode resistomes fig 3c three nonparametric dissimilarity tests mrpp adonis and anosim based on the two indices of jaccard and bray curtis together also indicated that the continuous electrical stimulation dramatically altered the cap reducing biocathode resistome structure p 0 005 table s2 the overall args diversity of the cbiocathode resistomes was marginally lowered upon the continuous electrical stimulation based on the richness h and 1 d indices p 0 10 compared to those of the obiocathode resistomes fig 3d this indicates that the persistent electrons donor of electrode could shape a relatively simple biocathode resistome 3 4 differences of args abundance at different families the cbiocathode showed lower gene abundance of the total antibiotic resistance p 0 094 smr p 0 061 and mfs p 0 048 than those of the obiocathode fig 4 a total of 122 mfs genes accounting for 2 20 of all the detected functional genes were detected in this study twenty mfs genes were absolutely undetected in 6 cbiocathode resistomes accounting for 16 39 but detected at least in 3 obiocathode resistomes comparatively only 4 mfs genes accounting for 3 28 were absolutely undetected in 6 obiocathode resistomes but appeared at least in 3 cbiocathode resistomes other arg categories were also showed relatively lower abundance in the cbiocathode than those in the obiocathode fig 4 pearson correlation analysis was used to explore whether the enhanced cap bioelectroreduction process could potentially minimize the enrichment of args in the biofilm microbiomes the results showed that total abundances of all detected args r 0 51 p 0 087 smr genes r 0 56 p 0 058 mfs genes r 0 59 p 0 042 and abc transporter genes r 0 50 p 0 096 were negatively correlated with amcl yield while smr genes r 0 49 p 0 101 mfs genes r 0 592 p 0 087 and abc genes r 0 51 p 0 094 were also negatively correlated with cap reduction efficiency fig 5 3 5 effects of electrical stimulation on the overall network structure and interactions to understand the effect of electrical stimulation on the biofilm network interactions from phylogenetic and functional genes perspectives phylogenetic and functional mens were constructed based on the identified 1566 otus from 16s rrna gene sequencing and 15636 functional genes detected from geochip hybridization analysis respectively the major topological properties of phylogenetic and functional networks were summarized table 1 and fig s5 based on the network size the number of otus or genes in a network namely node number and total link number the overall network complexity at phylogenetic and functional genes levels were both significantly higher under pure anaerobic condition obiocathode than under electrical stimulation condition cbiocathode specifically compared to the obiocathode the phylogenetic mens of the cbiocathode generally had significantly shorter path lengths higher clustering efficiencies and less modules table 1 which are key network properties in terms of system efficiency and robustness zhou et al 2010 2011 to better understand the interactions among different phyla and gene categories the two networks were visualized figs s4 and s5 taken the phylogenetic mens for example the impact of continuous electrical stimulation on the biofilm network structure and composition could be seen from phylum level the majority of the nodes in these two networks belonged to 11 phyla fig s4 among them proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and euryarchaeota were more dominant under electrical stimulation the relative proportions of firmicutes and euryarchaeota in the network enriched considerably while the percentage of proteobacteria decreased substantially fig s4 these results strongly suggest that continuous electrical stimulation could obviously affect the overall architecture of the mens in the cap reducing biofilms and consistently decrease the overall network complexity 3 6 effects of electrical stimulation on the resistome network structure and interactions to understand the arg interactions within the cbiocathode and obiocathode resistomes arg mens were constructed based on the detected 654 args from geochip hybridization analysis the cbiocathode and obiocathode resistomes were analyzed and the major topological properties of arg networks were summarized table 1 the overall topology indices showed that the network connectivity distributions fitted with the power law model r2 of power law from 0 639 to 0 720 to better understand the interactions among different arg families the two networks were visualized the majority of the nodes in these two networks belonged to 4 arg groups mfs β lactamase smr and tet the impact of continuous electrical stimulation on the biofilm resistome network structure could be seen from the arg family level among them smr and β lactamase genes showed more node number and proportion both in the cbiocathode and obiocathode followed by mfs and tet fig 6 and fig s6 based on the node number the network complexity for all arg families was generally higher under pure anaerobic condition obiocathode than under electrical stimulation condition cbiocathode although the relative proportions of most arg families were not obviously different between the cbiocathode and obiocathode fig s5 the obiocathode resistome had a more complex and quite different network structure than the cbiocathode resistome based on the average connectivity avgk from 2 402 to 2 966 node numbers from 209 to 294 and link numbers from 633 to 957 table 1 specifically the obiocathode resistome had significantly more total positive 691 vs 473 and negative 266 vs 160 links than those of the cbiocathode resistome fig s6 more positive correlations imply the co existence of diverse args during the bioreduction of cap for modules property a total of 14 modules with 5 nodes were obtained for the obiocathode networks while the cbiocathode networks had 4 modules with 5 nodes fig 6 we also further analyzed the mfs genes networks property because cap resistance genes mainly belong to this family and it showed obviously lower gene abundances in the cbiocathode than that of the obiocathode p 0 05 the number of mfs nodes and total links in the networks obviously decreased 1 90 and 2 18 times respectively upon continuous electrical stimulation moreover whether it is the cbiocathode or the obiocathode the proportion of positive links is greater 70 collectively the arg networks had considerably smaller network size significantly lower connectivity shorter path lengths and lower clustering efficiencies under continuous electrical stimulation than under no electrical stimulation consistent to the phylogenetic and functional mens continuous electrical stimulation also obviously altered the resistome network structure and impacted the network interactions among various arg families and markedly decreased the resistome network complexity in the anaerobic cap reducing biofilm system 4 discussion understanding the fate and profile of overall resistome during the biological treatment of antibiotic containing wastewater is a central issue for the water ecological safety assessment recent studies largely focused on the fate of the selected antibiotic associated args but not overall args during the bioelectrochemical treatment of different antibiotic contaminants guo et al 2017b 2018 yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 concretely zhang et al found that the target smx and tc args suli sulii suliii teta tetc teto tetq and tetw in the lower biocathode were present at a higher concentration than in the upper bioanode of the smx and tc treating up flow bess which is consistent with the bioanode zone showed the higher antibiotic removal efficiency than that of the biocathode zone zhang et al 2016 guo et al investigated the fate of args such as cap flor and cmla smx suli and tc tetc resistance as well as mobile genetic element integrase inti1 encoding genes during the bioelectroreduction of cap in the biocathode under different operational modes a higher cap concentration 20 mg l and 50 mg l compared to 10 mg l and less negative cathode potential 0 5 v vs she with the lowest cap reduction efficiency compared to that of the 1 25 v and 1 0 v operational modes enhanced the expression of cap resistance genes e g flor and cmla guo et al 2017b these results suggest that the enhanced antibiotic reduction could reduce the relative abundances of the specific args in the functional electrode respiring biofilms guo et al 2017b yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 which also agreed with that high antibiotic residual generally could increase the args abundance within anaerobic bioreactors guo et al 2017c interestingly guo et al also uncovered the distinct responses of representative args abundance of cap reducing biocathode to salinity gradient the relative abundances of cmla flor inti1 and sul1 under low salinity group 0 5 were significantly higher than those of the control and high salinity group 2 and 6 although the control 88 3 and high 6 salinity group 49 5 showed lower cap reduction efficiency than that of the low 0 5 salinity group 92 5 differently the relative abundance of tetc significantly increased as salinity increased guo et al 2018 however the response of overall resistome of the involved electrode associated multispecies biofilms especially the network structure and interactions to continuous electrical stimulation has not yet been reported using a comprehensive functional gene microarray geochip which contains 3334 probes targeting 11 arg families this study examined the cap reducing cathode biofilm resistomes under continuous electrical stimulation and analyzed the overall args structure composition diversity abundance and network interactions of the biocathode microbiomes with the pure anaerobic biofilm microbiomes as the control to understand how the biofilm resistome respond to continuous electrical stimulation during cap reduction the results showed that the overall cbiocathode and obiocathode resistome structures were significantly different and the relative abundances of various arg families especially mfs transporter genes which cover cap resistance genes e g flor cmla fexa fexb and pexa li et al 2013 were obviously lower in the cbiocathode than those in the obiocathode moreover the relative abundance of mfs genes was marginally or significantly negatively correlated with cap reduction efficiency r 0 592 p 0 087 and amcl yield r 0 59 p 0 042 in addition the cap bioelectroreduction reaction can also weaken the non redox cap acetylation resistant process based on the chemical data fig 2a the enhanced bioelectroreduction of cap to amcl appeared to exert smaller antibiotic selection pressure on the cbiocathode microbiomes and finally resulted in a significantly lower total args abundance especially for specific cap associated mfs genes more importantly continuous electrical stimulation could consistently decrease the phylogenetic functional and overall args diversity and network complexity within the cap reducing biofilms these results highlight that continuous electrical stimulation could minimize the possibility of evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and novel args by accelerating antibiotic detoxification during antibiotics containing wastewater treatment this information may be useful for the assessment of overall args risk for the bioelectrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants 5 conclusions the cap bioelectroreduction process can significantly accelerate the elimination of antibacterial activity of cap during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment compared to the pure bioreduction process continuous electrical stimulation obviously altered the resistome structure and decreased the args diversity abundance and network complexity within the cap reducing biocathode microbiomes the relative abundance of cap resistance associated mfs transporter genes was significantly negatively correlated with the reduction efficiency of cap to amcl these results strongly suggest that such a process has its advantage over conventional anaerobic treatment process on the minimization of the evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and args by accelerating antibiotic detoxification during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment this study offers new insights into the response of an antibiotics reducing biocathode resistome to continuous electrical stimulation and provides potentially useful information for the assessment of overall args risk for the bioelectrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 31870102 and 31500084 and the key research program of the chinese academy of

19213,drinking water supplies are increasingly affected by overlapping anthropogenic global change processes as a key currency of ecosystem function in aquatic ecosystems dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and composition is sensitive to many global change processes however doc must also be removed to avoid the production of harmful disinfection byproducts as water is processed thus understanding the effects of global change processes on the seasonal and long term dynamics of doc composition and concentration is critical for ensuring the sustainability of drinking water supplies to understand these dynamics we analyzed a novel 11 year time series of stream water doc concentration and composition using weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds to understand the influences of co occurring changes in climate and atmospheric deposition we also discuss the implications for water supply provision and management we found that during our study period overlapping global change processes in the watershed had the net effect of increasing the doc aromaticity as measured by suva254 at moderate to high discharge levels during the late spring and early summer and the autumn and early winter however changes in doc concentration were more dynamic and we observed both increasing and decreasing trends depending on season and hydrologic state during summer at low to moderate flow levels we observed a significant p 0 05 increase in doc concentration during autumn at moderate to high flow levels we observed a significant p 0 05 decrease in doc concentration and an increase in suva254 for drinking water providers our results suggest that close monitoring of source waters must be coupled with the development of plans accounting for season and hydrology

energy driving ecosystem functions and the derived service of clean drinking water lal et al 2013 the ability of managers to anticipate the concentration and composition of doc in drinking water sources is critical for providing safe drinking water if doc enters the water treatment and distribution process at too high a concentration or with too aromatic a composition it may interact with chemical disinfectants and form carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps hrudey 2009 rook 1977 long term changes in surface water dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and composition pose a challenge for anticipating doc concentrations frequently reported drivers of change include climate and mineral acid deposition driscoll et al 2016 studies investigating the drivers of long term change in doc concentration seldom consider changes in composition and infrequently seek to identify the seasonal and hydrologic dependencies of these trends filella and rodríguez murillo 2014 long term trends in stream water doc concentrations have been reported around the world and in particular in the northern hemisphere filella and rodríguez murillo 2014 these studies have observed increases decreases and no net change in response to change in anthropogenic and climatic drivers filella and rodríguez murillo 2014 stanley et al 2012 in europe and north america reduced mineral acid deposition in response to stricter environmental regulations is thought to increase doc export from watershed soils and it subsequent concentration in surface waters driscoll et al 2016 erlandsson et al 2008 monteith et al 2007 however the mechanisms affecting doc concentration and composition do not operate in isolation observed trends or lack thereof are the net effects of multiple drivers for example research in lakes of the northeastern united states found that doc concentration increased from 1986 to 2015 which was the summed effect of doc increasing with decreased sulfate deposition and doc increasing with increased autumn precipitation and temperature gavin et al 2018 understanding the net patterns that overlapping drivers of change may produce in watersheds is essential for long term planning of drinking water resources expression of these controls on doc concentration and composition may also depend on the hydrologic state of the system seasonal and storm event driven variations in hydrology drive variation in the degree of hydrologic connectivity between a stream and its watershed dawson et al 2008 leopold et al 1964 and therefore the sources and processes that regulate doc climate variability can alter precipitation and hydrologic regimes and thus the production leaching connectivity and transport of doc from sources like wetlands and upland forests eimers et al 2008 kaushal et al 2014 because storm flows typically have high concentrations and fluxes of organic matter from soils and plant litter relative to base flow dhillon and inamdar 2013 their quantitative and compositional responses to change processes like reduced acid deposition are also likely to be larger as such attempts to detect doc change must test for it across all seasons and hydrologic states this study sought to address the basic scientific and management need for temporal and hydrologic understanding of doc concentration and composition trends in a drinking water supply source we asked three key questions 1 how do seasonal and hydrologic dynamics affect the direction and magnitude of doc change 2 what concurrent global change processes explain these patterns 3 what are the management implications of seasonally and hydrologically dynamic trends in doc concentration to address these questions we analyzed a stream water doc concentration and composition time series from 2003 to 2015 using the weighted regression on time discharge and season wrtds approach hirsch et al 2010 we then interpreted the doc trends against trends in climate hydrology and water chemistry from the source watershed and atmospheric deposition chemistry data from a nearby watershed understanding how various drivers regulate doc concentrations and composition may enable water utilities to better plan and manage for these changes and associated treatment options 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection data were collected from the wilmington water treatment plant the plant as part of the routine drinking water production the plant supplies drinking water for 100 000 residents in the wilmington delaware area the treatment plant is located on brandywine creek fig 1 a fourth order stream draining portions of delaware and pennsylvania fig 1 and emptying into the delaware bay the watershed 833 km2 area is in a humid continental climate and between 2003 and 2015 received an average of 1164 mm of precipitation yr 1 from 2003 to 2015 temperatures varied seasonally with a mean of 2 7 c in winter and 23 3 c in summer national climate data center bedrock geology in the watershed is dominated by silica based crystalline formations with a small band 5 of land area of carbonate formation soils in the watershed were dominated by ultisols typic hapludults and inceptisols typic dystrudepts and to a lesser extent alfisols ultic hapludalfs all with moderately to strongly acidic soil horizons as of 2011 watershed land uses were primarily comprised of deciduous forest 29 9 developed land uses 27 6 and agricultural land uses 31 6 homer et al 2015 since 2002 to comply with the u s environmental protection agency s usepa stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rules the plant has collected total organic carbon toc concentration and ultra violet uv absorbance at 254 nm approximately three times a week excluding periods of maintenance when the plant was not operating the most complete dataset contains 884 measurements between 2004 and 2015 gaps in the time series exist when the plant was undergoing maintenance or drawing water from other sources i e when brandywine creek discharge is above the 95 flow level drinking water is drawn from a back up reservoir thus we have 869 observations below 50 m3 s 1 but only 15 above this so we restrict our interpretation and presentation of modeling results to values below that level samples for uv absorbance at 254 nm a254 were vacuum filtered through a 0 7 μm glass fiber filter and analyzed immediately samples for toc were not filtered and were preserved with phosphoric acid refrigerated and analyzed within 28 days analysis of a smaller coupled toc doc dataset collected by the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control during this period found that doc was on average 100 of toc n 107 0 9 for 95 confidence limits fig s1 thus we interpret and refer to our toc data as doc without correction these absorbance and doc concentration data were used to calculate specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg cm 1 suva254 has been used as an indicator of aromaticity with higher values of suva254 indicating more aromatic molecules weishaar et al 2003 higher values can also indicate a higher proportion of hydrophobic vs hydrophilic organic acids spencer et al 2012 the former being easier to remove from drinking water via coagulation than the latter matilainen et al 2010 2 2 hydrologic and climate data sources mean daily and 15 min

conducted in r r core team 2015 trends in annual and monthly climate and atmospheric deposition data were assessed using sen s slope s d accounting for serial dependence and τ accounting for seasonality τ s hirsch and slack 1984 kendallseasonaltrendtest function in r package envstats the results of these trend assessments were then used to interpret the results of doc concentration and composition modeling using weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds we modeled doc concentration composition suva254 and flux using wrtds modelestimation function in r package egret hirsch and de cicco 2015 this analysis uses a nonlinear weighted regression model that allows the relationship between doc concentration or composition and discharge to vary among seasons and through time in a dataset hirsch et al 2010 sprague et al 2011 modeled data were then analyzed to obtain expected concentration and composition surfaces heat maps these surfaces are two dimensional representations of 4 dimensional data consisting of time season discharge and modeled or expected doc concentration or suva254 as such each year of the 11 year datasets has a doc concentration or suva254 estimate for each of the 238 unique combinations of season and discharge we assessed monotonic trends through time in doc concentration or suva254 for each combination of season and discharge by calculating kendall s τ van belle and hughes 1984 and sen s slope estimator s i sen 1968 kendalltrendtest in r package envstats this analysis produced three separate trend surfaces describing different aspects of change over time 1 the s i surface slope describes annual rate of change in doc concentration mg doc l 1 yr 1 or suva254 l mg cm 1 yr 1 2 the τ i surface describes the strength and direction of monotonic changes 3 the p value surface indicates which areas of the s i or τ i surfaces represent statistically significant changes or trends from these expected concentration surfaces we also derived flow normalized fn concentration and flux estimates flow normalized data remove interannual or temporally random flow variability from the data this procedure averages the expected concentrations across all possible discharges for a given day weighted by the discharge distribution observed for that day in the dataset sprague et al 2011 trends in fn data are attributable to changes in point and non point sources processes hirsch et al 2010 the significance of trends in annual fn data were evaluated using a block boot strapping method r package egretci hirsch et al 2015 flow normalized data for suva254 were not possible to calculate where significant changes in concentration were observed we used bivariate ordinary least squares regression models to identify significant anthropogenic drivers for those changes lm function in r we regressed monthly flow normalized doc fn doc concentration or flux data on monthly mineral acid deposition precipitation or

compared using bayesian and corrected akike information criteria bic aicc models with lower values were considered better models and an absolute difference 2 between two models was used as the criteria for determining better model fit we used adjusted r 2 square of pearson s r hereafter r 2 as an indicator of strength of the relationship in all regression models 3 results 3 1 doc concentration flux and composition trends in the brandywine creek watershed using a boot strapped confidence interval at the annual time scale we found no significant trend in fn flux concentration or composition p 0 05 hirsch et al 2015 the average annual concentration of doc was approximately 2 5 mg l 1 during the study period and exhibited little interannual variability annual doc flux displays more interannual variability ranging from 9 5 to 27 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 fig s2 and was related to hydrology total discharge r 2 0 92 p 0 05 after accounting for seasonal and hydrologic dynamics fig 2 a and b we found evidence of both increasing and decreasing trends p 0 05 in doc concentration fig 3 and a trend toward more aromatic doc composition fig 4 since 2004 the doc concentrations modeled for autumn and early winter moderate to high flows decreased 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 annually s i p 0 05 fig 3a during moderate flows in winter and moderate to low flows in summer doc concentration increased 0 05

each year were observed during high flows in most seasons and low flows in the early spring fig 4 the results of the wrtds model and our subsequent analysis indicate that the largest changes in doc concentration may occur at flows well above 50 m3 s 1 however a paucity of data beyond 50 m3 s 1 reduces our certainty in this result 3 2 temporal trends in drivers of doc change 3 2 1 atmospheric deposition annual mineral acid concentration and areal deposition data indicated a significant decrease in mineral acid deposition between 2004 and 2015 fig s3 h concentrations in deposition decreased

ph increases occurred in march and june august r2 0 82 total annual no 3 deposition decreased 0 63 kg ha 1 yr 1 from 15 to 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 r 2 0 90 p 0 05 and so 4 2 deposition decreased 1 75 kg ha 1

for 50 of annual decrease decreases of 0 223 0 394 0 254 kg ha 1 yr 1 for june july and august respectively while decreases in monthly n o 3 deposition during april july and august accounted for 50 of the annual deposition decrease 0 110 0 099 0 107 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively reflecting the watershed scale impact of these deposition changes stream water alkalinity increased from 50 to 70 mg caco3 l

intensity totals and duration no significant changes in the hourly rainfall intensities at the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles were observed at the annual scale but at the monthly scale significant increasing and decreasing intensity trends were observed rainfall intensity at the 50th percentile increased in july s 0 21 mm h 1 yr 1 p 0 05 and decreased in february s 0 03 mm h 1 yr 1 p 0 05 at the 90th percentile rainfall intensity increased in january s 0 17 mm h 1 yr 1 p 0 05 and decreased in may and october s 0 38 and 0 21 mm h 1 yr 1 p 0 05 we did not observe any significant trends in total annual precipitation but we also observed a significant increase in total summer june august precipitation from 300 mm to 400 mm s 7 47 mm yr 1 p 0 05 this was mostly due to a significant increase in total august precipitation s 13 93 mm yr 1 p 0 05 while we did observe changes in precipitation intensity analysis of 15 min and mean daily stream flows in the brandywine creek revealed that there have been no significant changes in the magnitude of discharge for the 0 1 0 5 and 0 90 flow exceedance probabilities during our study period increases in temperature may also change the export of doc from terrestrial sources clark et al 2010 dawson et al 2008 in our ten year data set mean annual air temperature was 14 2 c monthly air temperatures min max mean did not display significant p 0 05 increasing or decreasing trends however a longer term increase of 3 5 5 5 c is predicted by 2100 in the brandywine watershed hayhoe et al 2013 3 3 effects on doc concentration flux and composition we used multivariate regression to select the best fitting and most parsimonious models aicc and bic explaining observed variation in flow normalized doc flux concentration and composition for fn flux and concentration after inspecting concentration surface trend plots fig 3 we focused the regression analysis on explaining changes in summer june august and autumn september november for fn composition after inspecting concentration surface trend plots fig 4 we focused on explaining changes in late spring early summer april june and autumn early winter september december models including deposition and climate variables produced best fit models for fn doc flux and concentration two models best explained autumn fn doc flux and concentration table 2 1 a deposition only model where autumn flux or concentration decreased with decreasing summer sulfate deposition sum of june july and august flux r 2 0 68 concentration r 2 0 59 p 0 05 2 a deposition and precipitation model where autumn fn doc flux decreased with decreasing summer sulfate deposition and increasing summer precipitation totals flux r 2 0 88 concentration r 2 0 77 p 0 05 all three metrics of model fit supported the second model including both summer deposition and precipitation totals table 2 while summer june july august fn doc flux and concentration were best explained by summer temperature precipitation and or deposition variables these models were not significant at p 0 05 for doc flux they suggested that it increased with 1 increasing summer precipitation intensity at the 50th percentile r2 0 34 p 0 06 2 increasing mean daily maximum temperatures in the summer r2 0 30 p 0 07 3 both mean daily maximum temperature and precipitation intensity at the 50th percentile in the summer r2 0 41 p 0 09 for doc concentration they suggested that it increased with 1 decreasing summer sulfate deposition r2 0 27 p 0 09 2 increasing mean daily maximum temperature in summer r2 0 29 p 0 08 3 both mean increasing daily maximum temperature and decreasing sulfate deposition r2 0 48 p 0 06 while temporal trends in other variables were observed in our bivariate analysis inclusion of the variables did not provide better fit or alternative mechanistic explanations for temporal trends in composition we observed an increase in aromaticity suva254 at moderate to high flow levels fig 4 this trend was strongest in the late spring and early summer april may june and in autumn and early winter september december none of the variables considered significantly explained changes in composition while the negative relationship between total summer sulfate deposition and suva254 provided the best model it was not statistically significant r2 0 18 p 0 13 4 discussion overlapping global change processes like climate change and atmospheric deposition can produce long term trends in doc concentration and composition in our study while composition trended toward greater aromaticity across hydrologic states and seasons concentration exhibited seasonal and hydrology dependent trends in particular the decreasing trend in fall doc concentration at moderate to high flows was balanced by an increase in concentration during late spring and summer low to moderate flows these seasonally and hydrologically dynamic changes were explained by atmospheric deposition temperature and or precipitation variables while these dynamics produced no change in the average annual doc concentration or total annual doc flux in our study watershed it did change their timing for management applications this change in timing shifted doc export from a hydrologic state and season where it did not enter into drinking water production to a state and season where it did and thus required removal thus detection of temporal trends in doc and other solutes for management purposes or biogeochemical understanding must consider their seasonally and hydrologically dynamic responses to global change processes 4 1 doc concentration and flux trends 4 1 1 mineral acid deposition sulfate deposition appeared to be the most important variable driving changes in autumn doc dynamics table 2 fig 5 during our study we observed an 80 decrease in atmospheric deposition during the 2003 2015 study period table 1 fig s3 likely due to regulatory controls on emissions lynch et al 2000 this decrease paralleled an increase in stream water alkalinity a response consistent with watershed recovery from mineral acid deposition driscoll et al 2016 in watersheds recovering from sulfate deposition the solubility and export of terrestrial doc increases evans et al 2012 the strong positive relationship between autumn fn doc concentration or flux and the total summer june august s o 4 2 deposition fig 5 suggests that the retentive controls exerted by sulfate deposition may produce seasonal lags in doc export in comparison to fall doc concentrations and fluxes which appeared to be controlled by mineral acid deposition summer doc concentration and fluxes were not significantly linked to deposition the lack of significant models explaining summer fluxes may be due to the relatively small number of observations n 12 the opposing relationships between doc and summer sulfate deposition in the summer compared to the fall are consistent with the release of doc export from a retentive control by sulfate we hypothesize that under high mineral acid deposition conditions doc produced in the summer was retained relatively in watershed soils and was only mobilized at high flows later in the autumn as mineral acid deposition declined this lagged effect dissipated making doc more mobile and increasing the export during the summer mid and low flows at the expense of higher autumn flows fig 2 4 1 2 climate in our dataset climate variability also contributed to the patterns we observed in doc concentration and flux at the annual scale doc flux fig 1b was driven by inter annual variability in hydrology and streamflow for example both 2004 and 2011 were years with an above average number of tropical storms impacting the brandywine creek watershed at finer temporal scales autumn doc flux and concentration and total summer rainfall were negatively correlated this suggests that along with mineral acid deposition transport mechanisms may be influencing the dynamics of doc export greater rainfall and transport of doc in the summer may leave less available for autumn transport in the summer although not significant flux was best explained by the climate variables mean daily maximum temperature and precipitation intensity at the 50th percentile table 2 while concentration was best explained by total summer sulfate deposition and mean daily maximum temperature more intense storms are more likely to produce surface and near surface flows that carry doc out of organic rich soil horizons e g inamdar et al 2011 with less sulfate deposition in the summer to retain doc produced in the soils the increased july rainfall intensity may have transported more doc from organic rich soil horizons global warming trends manifest over long time scales and in shorter records decadal temperature may appear relatively stable medhaug et al 2017 our lack of trend in climate data from 2003 to 2015 was consistent with an anomalous period 1998 2012 of temperature stability observed globally medhaug et al 2017 while we did not observe a temporal trend in temperature the positive regression relationship between summer temperature and summer doc flux and concentration table 2 suggests that predicted future temperature increases hayhoe et al 2013 may lead to greater doc export fig 3 this may in part be driven by enhanced microbial activity producing doc from soils and plant detritus 4 2 doc composition trends we observed an increase in dom aromaticity across seasons during our study period this increase was most significant during moderate to high flow levels in the spring through early summer and the fall through early winter fig 4 with significant changes in transport and retention mechanisms of doc we expected to see similar patterns in the composition of doc the lack of significant relationships with composition may be because factors like retention mineral acid deposition production temperatures and transport precipitation exert a relatively stronger control on the mass flux or mobility compared to the composition of that flux although not significant the negative relationship between summer sulfate deposition and fall suva254 was consistent with previous work in sweden that found doc in soils not receiving mineral acid treatments had higher aromaticity than soils receiving mineral acid treatment ekström et al 2011 we hypothesize that the broad increase in suva254 at moderate and high flows indicates that decreased acid deposition has made aromatic dom generally more available for transport from terrestrial soils 4 3 drinking water management implications ongoing human impacts climate change and ongoing recovery from impact mineral acid deposition due to management interventions has produced dynamic changes in doc flux and composition in the brandywine river watershed while these changes have not altered the total annual flux of doc they have changed the timing of that flux for planning purposes the concentration surfaces we present figs 3 and 4 indicate where managers can expect changes in the investment of effort and expense to ensure drinking water quality our results suggest that lower treatment effort may be required to remove doc during autumn storm flows due to decreasing concentration however this may be offset by increases in doc concentration during summer low and moderate flows while high flows may continue to represent an acute challenge in drinking water provision moderate and low flows may increasingly present a chronic challenge in water provision lower flow periods are critical stress periods for water supplies the increasing aromatic doc concentrations and aromatic content during summer low flows is particularly challenging since stream bacteria concentrations are also elevated at this warmer time of the year miller pers obs increased chlorine disinfection to counter the elevated bacteria levels could react with the elevated aromatic doc concentrations producing disinfection byproducts in the treatment system in the spring and early summer increases in doc concentration during colder temperatures at moderate and low hydrologic flows may require additional coagulant use and lowering of the ph in order to provide adequate doc removal due to lower rates of coagulation at lower temperatures xiao et al 2009 at the same time the increase in stream alkalinity reported in this study compounds this challenge requiring still more chemical pretreatment to lower the ph xiao et al 2009 5 conclusions these results illustrate the importance of considering multiple hydrologic states and different seasons when analyzing and interpreting long terms trends in both doc concentration and composition monitoring or analyzing doc trends at coarse temporal resolutions or within a narrow portion of the hydrologic spectrum e g only baseflow may overlook more complex trends occurring in specific seasons and hydrologic states e g high or low discharge recognition that both increasing and decreasing trends may occur at different hydrologic states or seasons will help water utilities better plan and budget for drinking water

19213,drinking water supplies are increasingly affected by overlapping anthropogenic global change processes as a key currency of ecosystem function in aquatic ecosystems dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and composition is sensitive to many global change processes however doc must also be removed to avoid the production of harmful disinfection byproducts as water is processed thus understanding the effects of global change processes on the seasonal and long term dynamics of doc composition and concentration is critical for ensuring the sustainability of drinking water supplies to understand these dynamics we analyzed a novel 11 year time series of stream water doc concentration and composition using weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds to understand the influences of co occurring changes in climate and atmospheric deposition we also discuss the implications for water supply provision and management we found that during our study period overlapping global change processes in the watershed had the net effect of increasing the doc aromaticity as measured by suva254 at moderate to high discharge levels during the late spring and early summer and the autumn and early winter however changes in doc concentration were more dynamic and we observed both increasing and decreasing trends depending on season and hydrologic state during summer at low to moderate flow levels we observed a significant p 0 05 increase in doc concentration during autumn at moderate to high flow levels we observed a significant p 0 05 decrease in doc concentration and an increase in suva254 for drinking water providers our results suggest that close monitoring of source waters must be coupled with the development of plans accounting for season and hydrology

challenge for anticipating doc concentrations frequently reported drivers of change include climate and mineral acid deposition driscoll et al 2016 studies investigating the drivers of long term change in doc concentration seldom consider changes in composition and infrequently seek to identify the seasonal and hydrologic dependencies of these trends filella and rodríguez murillo 2014 long term trends in stream water doc concentrations have been reported around the world and in particular in the northern hemisphere filella and rodríguez murillo 2014 these studies have observed increases decreases and no net change in response to change in anthropogenic and climatic drivers filella and rodríguez murillo 2014 stanley et al 2012 in europe and north america reduced mineral acid deposition in response to stricter environmental regulations is thought to increase doc export from watershed soils and it subsequent concentration in surface waters driscoll et al 2016 erlandsson et al 2008 monteith et al 2007 however the mechanisms affecting doc concentration and composition do not operate in isolation observed trends or lack thereof are the net effects of multiple drivers for example research in lakes of the northeastern united states found that doc concentration increased from 1986 to 2015 which was the summed effect of doc increasing with decreased sulfate deposition and doc increasing with increased autumn precipitation and temperature gavin et al 2018 understanding the net patterns that overlapping drivers of change may produce in watersheds is essential for long term planning of drinking water resources expression of these controls on doc concentration and composition may also depend on the hydrologic state of the system seasonal and storm event driven variations in hydrology drive variation in the degree of hydrologic connectivity between a stream and its watershed dawson et al 2008 leopold et al 1964 and therefore the sources and processes that regulate doc climate variability can alter precipitation and hydrologic regimes and thus the production leaching connectivity and transport of doc from sources like wetlands and upland forests eimers et al 2008 kaushal et al 2014 because storm flows typically have high concentrations and fluxes of organic matter from soils and plant litter relative to base flow dhillon and inamdar 2013 their quantitative and compositional responses to change processes like reduced acid deposition are also likely to be larger as such attempts to detect doc change must test for it across all seasons and hydrologic states this study sought to address the basic scientific and management need for temporal and hydrologic understanding of doc concentration and composition trends in a drinking water supply source we asked three key questions 1 how do seasonal and hydrologic dynamics affect the direction and magnitude of doc change 2 what concurrent global change processes explain these patterns 3 what are the management implications of seasonally and hydrologically dynamic trends in doc concentration to address these questions we analyzed a stream water doc concentration and composition time series from 2003 to 2015 using the weighted regression on time discharge and season wrtds approach hirsch et al 2010 we then interpreted the doc trends against trends in climate hydrology and water chemistry from the source watershed and atmospheric deposition chemistry data from a nearby watershed understanding how various drivers regulate doc concentrations and composition may enable water utilities to better plan and manage for these changes and associated treatment options 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection data were collected from the wilmington water treatment plant the plant as part of the routine drinking water production the plant supplies drinking water for 100 000 residents in the wilmington delaware area the treatment plant is located on brandywine creek fig 1 a fourth order stream draining portions of delaware and pennsylvania fig 1 and emptying into the delaware bay the watershed 833 km2 area is in a humid continental climate and between 2003

geology in the watershed is dominated by silica based crystalline formations with a small band 5 of land area of carbonate formation soils in the watershed were dominated by ultisols typic hapludults

deciduous forest 29 9 developed land uses 27 6 and agricultural land uses 31 6 homer et al 2015 since 2002 to comply with the u s environmental protection agency s usepa stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproducts rules the plant has collected total organic carbon toc concentration and ultra violet uv absorbance at 254 nm approximately three times a week excluding periods of maintenance when the plant was not operating the most complete dataset contains 884 measurements between 2004 and 2015 gaps in the time series exist when the plant was undergoing maintenance or drawing water from other sources i e when brandywine creek discharge is above the 95 flow level drinking water is drawn from a back up reservoir thus we have 869 observations below 50 m3 s 1 but only 15 above this so we restrict our interpretation and presentation of modeling results to values below that level samples for uv absorbance at 254 nm a254 were vacuum filtered through a 0 7 μm glass fiber filter and analyzed immediately samples for toc were not filtered and were preserved with phosphoric acid refrigerated and analyzed within 28 days analysis of a smaller coupled toc doc dataset collected by the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control during this period found that doc was on average 100 of toc n 107 0 9 for 95 confidence limits fig s1 thus we interpret and refer to our toc data as doc without correction these absorbance and doc concentration data were used to calculate specific ultra violet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 l mg cm 1 suva254 has been used as an indicator of aromaticity with higher values of suva254 indicating more aromatic molecules weishaar et al 2003 higher values can also indicate a higher proportion of hydrophobic vs hydrophilic organic

the annual deposition decrease 0 110 0 099 0 107 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively reflecting the watershed scale impact of these deposition changes stream water alkalinity increased from 50 to 70 mg caco3 l 1 between 2003 and 2015 fig s4 3 2 2 climate change precipitation stream flow and temperature we analyzed the 2004 2013 hourly precipitation record for annual and monthly changes in hourly rainfall intensity totals and duration no significant changes in the hourly rainfall intensities at the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles were observed at the annual scale but at the monthly scale significant increasing and decreasing intensity trends were observed rainfall intensity at the 50th percentile increased in july s 0 21 mm h 1 yr 1 p 0 05 and decreased in february s 0 03 mm h 1 yr 1 p 0 05 at the 90th percentile rainfall intensity increased in january s 0 17 mm h 1 yr 1 p 0 05 and decreased in may and october s 0 38 and 0 21 mm h 1 yr 1 p 0 05 we did not observe any significant trends in total annual precipitation but we also observed a significant increase in total summer june august precipitation from 300 mm to 400 mm s 7 47 mm yr 1 p 0 05 this was mostly due to a significant increase in total august precipitation s 13 93 mm yr 1 p 0 05 while we did observe changes in precipitation intensity analysis of 15 min and mean daily stream flows in the brandywine creek revealed that there have been no significant changes in the magnitude of discharge for the 0 1 0 5 and 0 90 flow exceedance probabilities during our study period increases in temperature may also change the export of doc from terrestrial sources clark et al 2010 dawson et al 2008 in our ten year data set mean annual air temperature was 14 2 c monthly air temperatures min max mean did not display significant p 0 05 increasing or decreasing trends however a longer term increase of 3 5 5 5 c is predicted by 2100 in the brandywine watershed hayhoe et al 2013 3 3 effects on doc concentration flux and composition we used multivariate regression to select the best fitting and most parsimonious models aicc and bic explaining observed variation in flow normalized doc flux concentration and composition for fn flux and concentration after inspecting concentration surface trend plots fig 3 we focused the regression analysis on explaining changes in summer june august and autumn september november for fn composition after inspecting concentration surface trend plots fig 4 we focused on explaining changes in late spring early summer april june and autumn early winter september december models including deposition and climate variables produced best fit models for fn doc flux and concentration two models best explained autumn fn doc flux and concentration table 2 1 a deposition only model where autumn flux or concentration decreased with decreasing summer sulfate deposition sum of june july and august flux r 2 0 68 concentration r 2 0 59 p 0 05 2 a deposition and precipitation model where autumn fn doc flux decreased with decreasing summer sulfate deposition and increasing summer precipitation totals flux r 2 0 88 concentration r 2 0 77 p 0 05 all three metrics of model fit supported the second model including both summer deposition and precipitation totals table 2 while summer june july august fn doc flux and concentration were best explained by summer temperature precipitation and or deposition variables these models were not significant at p 0 05 for doc flux they suggested that it increased with 1 increasing summer precipitation intensity at the 50th percentile r2 0 34 p 0 06 2 increasing mean daily maximum temperatures in the summer r2 0 30 p 0 07 3 both mean daily maximum temperature and precipitation intensity at the 50th percentile in the summer r2 0 41 p 0 09 for doc concentration they suggested that it increased with 1 decreasing summer sulfate deposition r2 0 27 p 0 09 2 increasing mean daily maximum temperature in summer r2 0 29 p 0 08 3 both mean increasing daily maximum temperature and decreasing sulfate deposition r2 0 48 p 0 06 while temporal trends in other variables were observed in our bivariate analysis inclusion of the variables did not provide better fit or alternative mechanistic explanations for temporal trends in composition we observed an increase in aromaticity suva254 at moderate to high flow levels fig 4 this trend was strongest in the late spring and early summer april may june and in autumn and early winter september december none of the variables considered significantly explained changes in composition while the negative relationship between total summer sulfate deposition and suva254 provided the best model it was not statistically significant r2 0 18 p 0 13 4 discussion overlapping global change processes like climate change and atmospheric deposition can produce long term trends in doc concentration and composition in our study while composition trended toward greater aromaticity across hydrologic states and seasons concentration exhibited seasonal and hydrology dependent trends in particular the decreasing trend in fall doc concentration at moderate to high flows was balanced by an increase in concentration during late spring and summer low to moderate flows these seasonally and hydrologically dynamic changes were explained by atmospheric deposition temperature and or precipitation variables while these dynamics produced no change in the average annual doc concentration or total annual doc flux in our study watershed it did change their timing for management applications this change in timing shifted doc export from a hydrologic state and season where it did not enter into drinking water production to a state and season where it did and thus required removal thus detection of temporal trends in doc and other solutes for management purposes or biogeochemical understanding must consider their seasonally and hydrologically dynamic responses to global change processes 4 1 doc concentration and flux trends 4 1 1 mineral acid deposition sulfate deposition appeared to be the most important variable driving changes in autumn doc dynamics table 2 fig 5 during our study we observed an 80 decrease in atmospheric deposition during the 2003 2015 study period table 1 fig s3 likely due to regulatory controls on emissions lynch et al 2000 this decrease paralleled an increase in stream water alkalinity a response consistent with watershed recovery from mineral acid deposition driscoll et al 2016 in watersheds recovering from sulfate deposition the solubility and export of terrestrial doc increases evans et al 2012 the strong positive relationship between autumn fn doc concentration or flux and the total summer june august s o 4 2 deposition fig 5 suggests that the retentive controls exerted by sulfate deposition may produce seasonal lags in doc export in comparison to fall doc concentrations and fluxes which appeared to be controlled by mineral acid deposition summer doc concentration and fluxes were not significantly linked to deposition the lack of significant models explaining summer fluxes may be due to the relatively small number of observations n 12 the opposing relationships between doc and summer sulfate deposition in the summer compared to the fall are consistent with the release of doc export from a retentive control by sulfate we hypothesize that under high mineral acid deposition conditions doc produced in the summer was retained relatively in watershed soils and was only mobilized at high flows later in the autumn as mineral acid deposition declined this lagged effect dissipated making doc more mobile and increasing the export during the summer mid and low flows at the expense of higher autumn flows fig 2 4 1 2 climate in our dataset climate variability also contributed to the patterns we observed in doc concentration and flux at the annual scale doc flux fig 1b was driven by inter annual variability in hydrology and streamflow for example both 2004 and 2011 were years with an above average number of tropical storms impacting the brandywine creek watershed at finer temporal scales autumn doc flux and concentration and total summer rainfall were negatively correlated this suggests that along with mineral acid deposition transport mechanisms may be influencing the dynamics of doc export greater rainfall and transport of doc in the summer may leave less available for autumn transport in the summer although not significant flux was best explained by the climate variables mean daily maximum temperature and precipitation intensity at the 50th percentile table 2 while concentration was best explained by total summer sulfate deposition and mean daily maximum temperature more intense storms are more likely to produce surface and near surface flows that carry doc out of organic rich soil horizons e g inamdar et al 2011 with less sulfate deposition in the summer to retain doc produced in the soils the increased july rainfall intensity may have transported more doc from organic rich soil horizons global warming trends manifest over long time scales and in shorter records decadal temperature may appear relatively stable medhaug et al 2017 our lack of trend in climate data from 2003 to 2015 was consistent with an anomalous period 1998 2012 of temperature stability observed globally medhaug et al 2017 while we did not observe a temporal trend in temperature the positive regression relationship between summer temperature and summer doc flux and concentration table 2 suggests that predicted future temperature increases hayhoe et al 2013 may lead to greater doc export fig 3 this may in part be driven by enhanced microbial activity producing doc from soils and plant detritus 4 2 doc composition trends we observed an increase in dom aromaticity across seasons during our study period this increase was most significant during moderate to high flow levels in the spring through early summer and the fall through early winter fig 4 with significant changes in transport and retention mechanisms of doc we expected to see similar patterns in the composition of doc the lack of significant relationships with composition may be because factors like retention mineral acid deposition production temperatures and transport precipitation exert a relatively stronger control on the mass flux or mobility compared to the composition of that flux although not significant the negative relationship between summer sulfate deposition and fall suva254 was consistent with previous work in sweden that found doc in soils not receiving mineral acid treatments had higher aromaticity than soils receiving mineral acid treatment ekström et al 2011 we hypothesize that the broad increase in suva254 at moderate and high flows indicates that decreased acid deposition has made aromatic dom generally more available for transport from terrestrial soils 4 3 drinking water management implications ongoing human impacts climate change and ongoing recovery from impact mineral acid deposition due to management interventions has produced dynamic changes in doc flux and composition in the brandywine river watershed while these changes have not altered the total annual flux of doc they have changed the timing of that flux for planning purposes the concentration surfaces we present figs 3 and 4 indicate where managers can expect changes in the investment of effort and expense to ensure drinking water quality our results suggest that lower treatment effort may be required to remove doc during autumn storm flows due to decreasing concentration however this may be offset by increases in doc concentration during summer low and moderate flows while high flows may continue to represent an acute challenge in drinking water provision moderate and low flows may increasingly present a chronic challenge in water provision lower flow periods are critical stress periods for water supplies the increasing aromatic doc concentrations and aromatic content during summer low flows is particularly challenging since stream bacteria concentrations are also elevated at this warmer time of the year miller pers obs increased chlorine disinfection to counter the elevated bacteria levels could react with the elevated aromatic doc concentrations producing disinfection byproducts in the treatment system in the spring and early summer increases in doc concentration during colder temperatures at moderate and low hydrologic flows may require additional coagulant use and lowering of the ph in order to provide adequate doc removal due to lower rates of coagulation at lower temperatures xiao et al 2009 at the same time the increase in stream alkalinity reported in this study compounds this challenge requiring still more chemical pretreatment to lower the ph xiao et al 2009 5 conclusions these results illustrate the importance of considering multiple hydrologic states and different seasons when analyzing and interpreting long terms trends in both doc concentration and composition monitoring or analyzing doc trends at coarse temporal resolutions or within a narrow portion of the hydrologic spectrum e g only baseflow may overlook more complex trends occurring in specific seasons and hydrologic states e g high or low discharge recognition that both increasing and decreasing trends may occur at different hydrologic states or seasons will help water utilities better plan and budget for drinking water

19214,the degradation of organic contaminants under high salinity condition is still a challenge for environmental remediation due to the inhibiting effect resulted from the side reactions between radicals and anions here we demonstrate the non radical oxidation process via peroxymonosulfate pms activation by metal free carbon catalyst for efficiently decomposing bisphenol a bpa in saline water the nitrogen doped graphitic carbon ngc700 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for depredating bpa at acid and neutral ph based on the scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr

moletta 2006 yan et al 2012 the integrated effects of salts and pollutants lead to serious inhibition and toxicity to bacteria causing for the futility of biological treatment kargi and dincer 1996 wang et al 2002 advanced oxidation processes aops generally possess highly reactive oxygen species that could efficiently degrade refractory contaminants making them promising technologies for practical environmental remediation of organic wastewater comninellis et al 2008 klavarioti et al 2009 of numerous types of reactive oxygen species hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 are highlighted in aops which is universally involved in fenton catalysis wang et al 2017c ozonation lee et al 2013 photocatalysis tian et al 2011 and sulfate radical based fenton like reaction luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 the radicals oh so4 with high oxidative potential show the dominant contribution to decomposing contaminants for these oxidation processes however the performance of radical based aops toward degrading pollutants in saline water is hindered to a certain degree due to the reactions between oh so4 and anions cl hco3 h2po4 etc which led to the generation of weaker radicals cl hco3 h2po4 etc clifton 1990 george et al 2006 lutze et al 2015 yang et al 2010 yang et al 2015 this inhibiting effect could decrease the degradation performance of the targeted pollutant the imperfection severely limits the practical application of aops toward remediating organic wastewater under high salinity condition non radical aops have been attracting increasing attention due to the typical degradation process dominated by non radical reactive oxygen species duan et al 2015b zhang et al 2014 recently croué reported that cuo improved the ozonation without generating oh where bicarbonate a ubiquitous scavenger for hydroxyl radical significantly enhanced the catalytic performance instead of inhibiting zhang et al 2012 the similar phenomenon was observed on peroxydisulfate pds activation under cuo catalysis zhang et al 2014 these results reveal that non radical aops exhibit great resistance to some anions for a long time metal based heterogeneous catalysts were applied to catalyze reactive oxygen species h2o2 pds peroxymonosulfate pms to enhance the degradation process although these catalysts usually showed excellent catalytic performance the metal leaching induced secondary contamination is commonly inevitable luo et al 2018 wang et al 2017a conversely nitrogen doped carbon nc as metal free and environment friendly material demonstrated the enhanced catalytic

sampling 0 75 ml was carried at selected time intervals and added to 0 75 ml methanol containing ascorbic acid 20 mm then the mix solution immediately filtered through 0 22 μm film the bpa

agent 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of ngc700 fesem and tem were employed to characterize the morphology and nanostructure of ngc700 the fesem image fig 1 a exhibits that ngc700 consists of interconnected spherical carbon particles with a rough surface and abundant interval space which shows the typical morphology of the carbon derived from deep eutectic solvents gutiérrez et al 2011 lopez salas et al 2014 the tem image shows the porous structure of ngc700 that could provide abundant active sites fig 1b the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm and the pore size distribution were shown in fig s1a and 1b ngc700 shows a type iv a isotherm which indicates the sample is a typical mesoporous material cychosz et al 2016 the calculated specific surface area and pore volume of ngc700 were 1236 m2 g and 0 69 m3 g respectively the pore distribution further shows the hierarchical structure with micropores and mesopores of ngc700 which could accelerate the mass transfer to enhance catalytic activity the crystalline structure of the sample was characterized by the x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig s1c diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 and 43 corresponding to the d spacing and in plane structure were observed indicating the apparent graphitic structure hu et al 2013 li et al 2015b wang et al 2013 the raman spectroscopy further verified the graphitization of ngc700 due to the high id ig 1 02 value fig s1d xps survey spectrum indicates that ngc700 primarily composes c 85 5 n 10 5 and o 4 corresponding to the peaks centered at 284 400 and 532 ev fig 1c the n 1s spectrum was further analyzed to explore the existing n species fig 1d displays the deconvoluted n 1s spectra that indicate pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and n oxide are the primary forms he et al 2016 3 2 catalytic activity the catalytic activity of ngc700 was evaluated by activation of pms to degrade bpa in aqueous solution firstly fig 2 a exhibited the adsorptive performances of kinetics and isotherm of bpa the catalyst rapidly reached the adsorption desorption equilibrium and showed the adsorbed amount of 104 mg g 52 removal within 20 min the adsorption behavior followed pseudo second order kinetics according to the fitting data the adsorption isotherm further revealed that ngc700 exhibits excellent adsorption ability and the theoretical maximal adsorption capacity reached to 167 mg g fig 2a inset which could be attributed to the high specific surface area graphitic structure and high nitrogen content jin et al 2015 li et al 2018 the efficient adsorption as a driving force could enhance the degradation rate of the targeted pollutant liu et al 2014 on the other hand the real catalytic activity of ngc700 may be exaggerated during the oxidation process due to its great adsorption ability therefore to objectively evaluate the performance of the catalyst methanol was added after sampling to extract bpa from ngc700 to the solution as shown in fig 2b 11 of bpa was adsorbed within 10 min the degradation was performed after the adsorption desorption equilibrium fig 2b only less than 7 of bpa was degraded when the pms was used alone suggesting the negligible intrinsic oxidizing power of pms under the condition when the ngc700 and pms were present together more than 98 of bpa was efficiently degraded within 4 min it was much higher than the nanostructured co3o4 69 indicating the superior catalytic activity of the sample moreover the catalyst outperformed many reported catalysts table s1 since reaction conditions play a critical role in the catalyst process the effect of initial ph and reaction temperature of the solution as important parameters on the degradation of bpa was examined fig 2c the degradation rate showed a notable increase from ph 9 to ph 7 and a slightly continual rise when the ph decreased to 2 9 indicating that the acid condition was in favor of improving the catalytic activity the phenomenon could be explained that the protonated nitrogen species induced the positive charge on the surface of ngc700 facilitated the adsorption of negatively charged pms hso5 hu et al 2017 the result was consistent with the previous works as well wang et al 2017a b c overall ngc700 pms system exhibited high efficiency over a wide range of ph values reaction temperature as a factor for the treatment of wastewater was further investigated fig 2d the degradation performance slightly enhanced at elevated temperatures which benefited from the endothermic nature of pms activation luo et al 2017a b moreover the correlation between the reaction rate constant and reaction temperature was fitted well fig 2d inset the estimated apparent activation energy was 30 kj mol according to the arrhenius equation which reveals that the change of reaction temperature shows a relatively small effect on the degradation efficiency of bpa 3 3 reactive oxygen species responsible for bpa degradation the scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analyses are typical tests for investigating the reactive radical species during the decomposition process so4 and oh are generally regarded as reactive oxygen species in the pms activation process etoh has a high activity reacted with so4 k so4 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 but tba just possesses good reactivity with oh k oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 which were widely used as scavengers to identify the radical species as shown in fig s2a the effect of high ratio radical scavengers mscavenger mpms 1000 on the ngc700 pms system was tested etoh exhibited a negligible inhibiting impact on the bpa degradation indicating the tiny quantity of reactive radicals so4 or oh in the ngc700 pms system moreover superoxide radical o2 has limited reaction activity with electron rich centers because of its anionic charge d autréaux and toledano 2007 which can hardly oxidize the target pollutant overall we can conclude that the degradation process of ngc700 pms system is a non radical pathway on the contrary tba shows a slight inhibiting effect on the bpa degradation compared with etoh which may be because tba has a stronger affinity with the ngc700 due to the hydrophobic interaction hu et al 2017 the competitive adsorption between tba and bpa results in the poor degradation performance we further conducted epr analyses to confirm the non radical pathway as shown in fig s2b the typical peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were observed when the pms was alone which could be assigned to dmpo oh suggesting the presence of oh ai et al 2013 gong et al 2015 a set of peaks around the signals of oh were assigned to dmpo so4 indicating the presence of so4 timmins et al 1999 however the intensity of corresponding signals of oh and so4 slightly decreased when ngc700 and pms were used together importantly pms generally exhibits very low efficiency to generate so4 without catalysis so it could further confirm that ngc700 pms system shows a non radical activation process according to above results since so4 oh and o2 have been eliminated as the dominant reactive oxygen species during the catalytic oxidation we speculate that it is supposed to 1o2 l histidine or azide sodium was generally used as the scavenger to confirm the presence of 1o2 huang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however lee recently verified that the inhibitory effect of l histidine and azide was primarily ascribed to the rapid pms depletion yun et al 2018 to confirm the reactive oxygen species we replaced the deionized water as d2o because the lifetime of 1o2 could be markedly extended gorman and rodgers 1981 the removal efficiency of bpa in d2o accelerated fig 3 a and the reaction rate constant k increased about 38 compared with that in deionized water fig 3a inset the result confirmed that 1o2 was the reactive oxygen species in addition β carotene k 1o2 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 as a typical scavenger of 1o2 was used in quenching tests to further reveal the degradation mechanism wang and jiao 2000 which was hardly oxidized by pms fig s3 the experiments were performed in acetone as β carotene cannot dissolve in deionized water as shown in fig 3b the presence of low concentration β carotene 0 04 and 0 08 mm could severely hinder the degradation efficiency suggesting that the 1o2 was the main contributor to bpa degradation moreover epr analysis was further characterized to verify the above assumption 1o2 as a strong electrophile can oxidize temp to tempo which is paramagnetic and could be detected by epr alia et al 2001 fig 3c showed that a typical three line epr spectrum with equal intensities of tempo αn 17 0 g g 2 0063 was clearly observed das and das 2000 which was be consistent with the spectrum of commercial tempo αn 17 1 g g 2 0061 fig s4 indicating the generation of 1o2 recently lee and coauthors clearly demonstrated that the carbon nanotube cnt mediated electron transfer from contaminants to pms played major role for the elimination of contaminants in cnt pms system yun et al 2017 2018 the effective degradation could be achieved even the contaminant was added after mixing cnt and pms to examine the mechanism in ngc700 pms system the interaction between ngc700 and pms was investigated firstly pms and ngc700 were mixed for reaction in the solution then bpa was added after regular time intervals if the catalyst could mediate electron transfer between bpa and pms the mixing in advance would show no significant influence on the removal efficiency if ngc700 activated pms for generation of 1o2 the removal efficiency would gradually decrease with longer mixing time as pms and 1o2 were consumed constantly as shown in fig 3d the removal rate of bpa decreased with longer mixing time and the degradation process was sharply inhibited when the mixing time reached to 6 min indicating the consume of pms and the interaction between pms and ngc700 the results further confirmed that 1o2 dominated the oxidation process based our observation the mechanism in ngc700 pms system seems different from cnt pms system yun et al 2017 2018 this should be ascribed to the inherent characteristics of used carbon materials structurally high sp2 hybrid structure and wrapping angle endows cnt with highly graphitic structure which favors electron transfer while in this study ngc700 showed amorphous carbon structure with partial graphitic structure and high nitrogen content fig s1 compositionally n doped carbon is beneficial to generation of 1o2 in pms system which is confirmed by very recent reports huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 3 4 effect of anions on ngc700 pms system anions cl hco3 h2po4 etc play an essential role in pms activation which could react with radicals oh and so4 to form weaker radicals resulting in poor degradation performance clifton 1990 george et al 2006 lutze et al 2015 yang et al 2010 yang et al 2015 the non radical aops could be used to conquer the inhibiting effect of anions and efficiently degrade organic pollutants in saline water as a proof of concept the bpa removal efficiency was investigated in ngc700 pms system with various concentrations of anions fig 4 according to previous reports grebel et al 2010 luo et al 2017a b hco3 showed an abominable effect on pms activation and the inhibitory effect increased with higher hco3 concentration encouragingly for ngc700 pms system the negligible effect was observed and the bpa removal efficiency still maintained at a high level even the hco3 concentration reached to 500 mm fig 4a this result indicates that ngc700 pms is much more efficient than metal pms system toward hco3 with the analogical orderliness the no3 h2po4 had negligible influence on bpa degradation within 500 mm fig 4b c in general the inhibitory effect of anions was attributable to the reaction with radicals oh and so4 to generate weaker radicals we confirmed that ngc700 pms followed the non radical pathway dominated by 1o2 and almost no radicals were produced during the catalytic process fig 3 hence reaction between radicals oh and so4 and anions was avoided which insured the high efficiency of ngc700 pms system with various concentrations of anions cl is pervasive in wastewater and could be readily oxidized by oh and so4 to lower the catalytic performance however the dual effect of cl was reported in pms activation chen et al 2016 wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 the effect of cl on bpa degradation was also investigated in ngc700 pms system interestingly cl markedly facilitated the catalytic process and even the acceleration was enhanced with higher cl concentration fig 4d which was much different from other anions and some reported works lou et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 to further analyze the role of cl the catalytic processes without ngc700 were carried out as shown in fig 5 a the bpa degradation was dramatically enhanced with higher concentration cl when the cl reached to 300 mm the bpa was instantaneously degraded it was in accordance with the degradation performance when 500 mm of cl was added in ngc700 pms system indicating that the catalysis of cl was attributable to the excellent activity the hplc analysis of intermediate products in cl pms system was further performed fig 5b although the removal rate of bpa retention time 4 8 min increased two by products generated gc ms was employed to identify the intermediates three typical peaks labeled as p1 p2 and p3 were observed which matched well with hplc spectra fig 5c moreover the chemical structures of the three compounds were confirmed p1 p2 and p3 were assigned to the peaks of bpa 2 chloro 4 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 propanyl phenol and 4 4 lsopropylidene bis 2 chlorophenol respectively fig 5d the generated reactive cl species during pms oxidation generally is cl or hocl to further investigate the role of cl in ngc700 pms oxidation process the radical scavenger experiments were performed etoh for scavenging oh and so4 hco3 for scavenging cl oh et al 2016 as shown in fig 5e high concentration radical scavengers had no influence on the catalytic activity of cl indicating that almost no radical cl oh and so4 was formed to verify the generation of hocl rbh as a fluorescence probe of hocl was added in cl pms system zhang et al 2011 the result showed that the fluorescence intensity markedly enhanced when cl was present suggesting the generation of hocl fig 5f these results revealed that cl reacted with pms to generate hocl directly which gave rise to the instantaneous degradation of bpa the phenomenon was in accordance with other works to a certain degree wang et al 2011 however the bpa was just converted to other two by products that were not degraded effectively under the cl catalysis fig 5b when the ngc700 and cl were added together the by products were efficiently degraded within 2 min fig s5 the results indicate that cl exhibits a significant synergistic effect on the degradation of the targeted pollutant for ngc700 pms system moreover we changed the bpa to phenol for investigating the synergistic effect of cl only 23 of phenol was degraded when the cl is 500 mm with the presence of pms fig s6 the accelerated degradation was also achieved but much lower than bpa suggesting that the synergistic effect of cl is mainly depended on the intrinsic property of the targeted pollutants 3 5 effect of water quality on the bpa degradation natural organic matters nom are ubiquitous in water which usually shows an adverse impact on the remediation of organic wastewater li et al 2015a b matilainen and sillanpää 2010 humic acid ha as one of typical nom was taken into account in bpa degradation in the ngc700 pms system fig 6 a displays that the presence of ha has a slightly inhibiting effect on the bpa degradation interestingly the inhibiting effect did not further enhance with higher ha concentrations ngc700 pms system the results indicate that ha shows weak reactive activity with 1o2 which could ensure the high degradation efficiency of the target pollutant furthermore the catalytic tests were performed in the tap water and surface water to investigate the integrated effects of background ions and nom on the degradation of bpa since they are pervasive in wastewater as shown in fig 6b the degradation efficiency of bpa in tap water is extremely close to that obtained for deionized water suggesting the negligible negative effect the degradation efficiency of bpa in river water maintains a high level and only shows a very slight decrease compared with others indicating that the ngc700 pms system showed the high great resistance to nom and background ions 3 6 reusability tests the reusability tests of the catalyst were performed fig s7 more than 98 of bpa was efficiently degraded within 6 min for the first run but bpa removal at 49 of bpa was attained in 10 min for the second run the phenomenon was generally reported in other works duan et al 2015a b lee et al 2016 carbon as catalyst accelerates the reaction rate meanwhile it could be oxidized by reactive oxygen species to a certain degree and oxygen containing groups of carbon increased which led to the loss of active sites hu et al 2017 therefore the catalytic activity of carbon could be recovered to a certain degree after thermal treatment duan et al 2015a b as shown in fig s7 the used ngc700 after heat treatment in n2 showed enhanced catalytic activity bpa removal at 78 of bpa was attained in 10 min although heat treatment could recover the activity to a certain degree the reusability of carbon materials is not as good as that of metal based catalysts encouragingly yu recently reported a biochar catalyst with enhanced reusability for which nearly 100 removal efficiency could be achieved from second to the fifth run huang et al 2018 that represents a further step towards the application of carbon based catalysts in pms activation 4 conclusion in summary we demonstrated the non radical oxidation process via pms activation by metal free carbon catalyst for efficient degradation of organic contaminant in saline water different from conventional metal oxide pms system a tiny amount of radicals oh and so4 were generated in ngc700 pms system and singlet oxygen was identified as the dominated reactive species during the catalytic oxidation leveraging the non radical

19214,the degradation of organic contaminants under high salinity condition is still a challenge for environmental remediation due to the inhibiting effect resulted from the side reactions between radicals and anions here we demonstrate the non radical oxidation process via peroxymonosulfate pms activation by metal free carbon catalyst for efficiently decomposing bisphenol a bpa in saline water

remediation under high salinity condition graphical abstract image 1 keywords non radical inhibiting effect anions singlet oxygen high salinity condition 1 introduction high salinity organic wastewater characterized by high concentration of soluble salts and refractory organic compounds is generated by many industrial processes including agro food tanning dyeing and so on lefebvre and moletta 2006 yan et al 2012 the integrated effects of salts and pollutants lead to serious inhibition and toxicity to bacteria causing for the futility of biological treatment kargi and dincer 1996 wang et al 2002 advanced oxidation processes aops generally possess highly reactive oxygen species that could efficiently degrade refractory contaminants making them promising technologies for practical environmental remediation of organic wastewater comninellis et al 2008 klavarioti et al 2009 of numerous types of reactive oxygen species hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 are highlighted in aops which is universally involved in fenton catalysis wang et al 2017c ozonation lee et al 2013 photocatalysis tian et al 2011 and sulfate radical based fenton like reaction luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 the radicals oh so4 with high oxidative potential show the dominant contribution to decomposing contaminants for these oxidation processes however the performance of radical based aops toward degrading pollutants in saline water is hindered to a certain degree due to the reactions between oh so4 and anions cl hco3 h2po4 etc which led to the generation of weaker radicals cl hco3 h2po4 etc clifton 1990 george et al 2006 lutze et al 2015 yang et al 2010 yang et al 2015 this inhibiting effect could decrease the degradation performance of the targeted pollutant the imperfection severely limits the practical application of aops toward remediating organic wastewater under high salinity condition non radical aops have been attracting increasing attention due to the typical degradation process dominated by non radical reactive oxygen species duan et al 2015b zhang et al 2014 recently croué reported that cuo improved the ozonation without generating oh where bicarbonate a ubiquitous scavenger for hydroxyl radical significantly enhanced the catalytic performance instead of inhibiting zhang et al 2012 the similar phenomenon was observed on peroxydisulfate pds activation under cuo catalysis zhang et al 2014 these results reveal that non radical aops exhibit great resistance to some anions for a long time metal based heterogeneous catalysts were applied to catalyze reactive oxygen species h2o2 pds peroxymonosulfate pms to enhance the degradation process although these catalysts usually showed excellent catalytic performance the metal leaching induced secondary contamination is commonly inevitable luo et al 2018 wang et al 2017a conversely nitrogen doped carbon nc as metal free and environment friendly material demonstrated the enhanced catalytic activity when activating pms to degrade organic pollutants which could serve as promising candidates in environmental remediation huang et al 2018 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2016 moreover wang showed that nitrogen modified carbon nanotubes cnts significantly improved the phenol degradation compared with pristine cnts revealing the non radical pathways of activation mechanism of pms duan et al 2015b in consideration of the merits it is particularly attractive to use nc pms system for degrading pollutants under high salinity condition the objective of this work is to leverage the features of

obtained on renishaw in via reflex spectrometer system phi quantera ii esca system was employed for x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps test 2 4 catalytic performance the catalytic activity of ngc700 was evaluated by activating pms for degradation of bpa most of the tests were repeated 3 times and confidence level was set as 95 in a typical experiment 5 mg of catalyst was added in 50 ml of the solution containing bpa 20 mg l to establish an adsorption desorption equilibrium 20 min then pms 0 2 g l was added to start the oxidation process the stirring rate of the solution was kept at 400 rpm sampling 0 75 ml was carried at selected time intervals and added to 0 75 ml methanol containing ascorbic acid 20 mm then the mix solution immediately filtered through 0 22 μm film the bpa

agent 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of ngc700 fesem and tem were employed to characterize the morphology and nanostructure of ngc700 the fesem image fig 1 a exhibits that ngc700 consists of interconnected spherical carbon particles with a rough surface and abundant interval space which shows the typical morphology of the carbon derived from deep eutectic solvents gutiérrez et al 2011 lopez salas et al 2014 the tem image shows the porous structure of ngc700 that could provide abundant active sites fig 1b the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm and the pore size distribution were shown in fig s1a and 1b ngc700 shows a type iv a isotherm which indicates the sample is a typical mesoporous material cychosz et al 2016 the calculated specific surface area and pore volume of ngc700 were 1236 m2 g and 0 69 m3 g respectively the pore distribution further shows the hierarchical structure with micropores and mesopores of ngc700 which could accelerate the mass transfer to enhance catalytic activity the crystalline structure of the sample was characterized by the x ray diffraction xrd as shown in fig s1c diffraction peaks at 2θ 26 and 43 corresponding to the d spacing and in plane structure were observed indicating the apparent graphitic structure hu et al 2013 li et al 2015b wang et al 2013 the raman spectroscopy further verified the graphitization of ngc700 due to the high id ig 1 02 value fig s1d xps survey spectrum indicates that ngc700 primarily composes c 85 5 n 10 5 and o 4 corresponding to the peaks centered at 284 400 and 532 ev fig 1c the n 1s spectrum was further analyzed to explore the existing n species fig 1d displays the deconvoluted n 1s spectra that indicate pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and n oxide are the primary forms he et al 2016 3 2 catalytic activity the catalytic activity of ngc700 was evaluated by activation of pms to degrade bpa in aqueous solution firstly fig 2 a exhibited the adsorptive performances of kinetics and isotherm of bpa the catalyst rapidly reached the adsorption desorption equilibrium and showed the adsorbed amount of 104 mg g 52 removal within 20 min the adsorption behavior followed pseudo second order kinetics according to the fitting data the adsorption isotherm further revealed that ngc700 exhibits excellent adsorption ability and the theoretical maximal adsorption capacity reached to 167 mg g fig 2a inset which could be attributed to the high specific surface area graphitic structure and high nitrogen content jin et al 2015 li et al 2018 the efficient adsorption as a driving force could enhance the degradation rate of the targeted pollutant liu et al 2014 on the other hand the real catalytic activity of ngc700 may be exaggerated during the oxidation process due to its great adsorption ability therefore to objectively evaluate the performance of the catalyst methanol was added after sampling to extract bpa from ngc700 to the solution as shown in fig 2b 11 of bpa was adsorbed within 10 min the degradation was performed after the adsorption desorption equilibrium fig 2b only less than 7 of bpa was degraded when the pms was used alone suggesting the negligible intrinsic oxidizing power of pms under the condition when the ngc700 and pms were present together more than 98 of bpa was efficiently degraded within 4 min it was much higher than the nanostructured co3o4 69 indicating the superior catalytic activity of the sample moreover the catalyst outperformed many reported catalysts table s1 since reaction conditions play a critical role in the catalyst process the effect of initial ph and reaction temperature of the solution as important parameters on the degradation of bpa was examined fig 2c the degradation rate showed a notable increase from ph 9 to ph 7 and a slightly continual rise when the ph decreased to 2 9 indicating that the acid condition was in favor of improving the catalytic activity the phenomenon could be explained that the protonated nitrogen species induced the positive charge on the surface of ngc700 facilitated the adsorption of negatively charged pms hso5 hu et al 2017 the result was consistent with the previous works as well wang et al 2017a b c overall ngc700 pms system exhibited high efficiency over a wide range of ph values reaction temperature as a factor for the treatment of wastewater was further investigated fig 2d the degradation performance slightly enhanced at elevated temperatures which benefited from the endothermic nature of pms activation luo et al 2017a b moreover the correlation between the reaction rate constant and reaction temperature was fitted well fig 2d inset the estimated apparent activation energy was 30 kj mol according to the arrhenius equation which reveals that the change of reaction temperature shows a relatively small effect on the degradation efficiency of bpa 3 3 reactive oxygen species responsible for bpa degradation the scavenger experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analyses are typical tests for investigating the reactive radical species during the decomposition process so4 and oh are generally regarded as reactive oxygen species in the pms activation process etoh has a high activity reacted with so4 k so4 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 and oh k oh 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 but tba just possesses good reactivity with oh k oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 which were widely used as scavengers to identify the radical species as shown in fig s2a the effect of high ratio radical scavengers mscavenger mpms 1000 on the ngc700 pms system was tested etoh exhibited a negligible inhibiting impact on the bpa degradation indicating the tiny quantity of reactive radicals so4 or oh in the ngc700 pms system moreover superoxide radical o2 has limited reaction activity with electron rich centers because of its anionic charge d autréaux and toledano 2007 which can hardly oxidize the target pollutant overall we can conclude that the degradation process of ngc700 pms system is a non radical pathway on the contrary tba shows a slight inhibiting effect on the bpa degradation compared with etoh which may be because tba has a stronger affinity with the ngc700 due to the hydrophobic interaction hu et al 2017 the competitive adsorption between tba and bpa results in the poor degradation performance we further conducted epr analyses to confirm the non radical pathway as shown in fig s2b the typical peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were observed when the pms was alone which could be assigned to dmpo oh suggesting the presence of oh ai et al 2013 gong et al 2015 a set of peaks around the signals of oh were assigned to dmpo so4 indicating the presence of so4 timmins et al 1999 however the intensity of corresponding signals of oh and so4 slightly decreased when ngc700 and pms were used together importantly pms generally exhibits very low efficiency to generate so4 without catalysis so it could further confirm that ngc700 pms system shows a non radical activation process according to above results since so4 oh and o2 have been eliminated as the dominant reactive oxygen species during the catalytic oxidation we speculate that it is supposed to 1o2 l histidine or azide sodium was generally used as the scavenger to confirm the presence of 1o2 huang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however lee recently verified that the inhibitory effect of l histidine and azide was primarily ascribed to the rapid pms depletion yun et al 2018 to confirm the reactive oxygen species we replaced the deionized water as d2o because the lifetime of 1o2 could be markedly extended gorman and rodgers 1981 the removal efficiency of bpa in d2o accelerated fig 3 a and the reaction rate constant k increased about 38 compared with that in deionized water fig 3a inset the result confirmed that 1o2 was the reactive oxygen species in addition β carotene k 1o2 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 as a typical scavenger of 1o2 was used in quenching tests to further reveal the degradation mechanism wang and jiao 2000 which was hardly oxidized by pms fig s3 the experiments were performed in acetone as β carotene cannot dissolve in deionized water as shown in fig 3b the presence of low concentration β carotene 0 04 and 0 08 mm could severely hinder the degradation efficiency suggesting that the 1o2 was the main contributor to bpa degradation moreover epr analysis was further characterized to verify the above assumption 1o2 as a strong electrophile can oxidize temp to tempo which is paramagnetic and could be detected by epr alia et al 2001 fig 3c showed that a typical three line epr spectrum with equal intensities of tempo αn 17 0 g g 2 0063 was clearly observed das and das 2000 which was be consistent with the spectrum of commercial tempo αn 17 1 g g 2 0061 fig s4 indicating the generation of 1o2 recently lee and coauthors clearly demonstrated that the carbon nanotube cnt mediated electron transfer from contaminants to pms played major role for the elimination of contaminants in cnt pms system yun et al 2017 2018 the effective degradation could be achieved even the contaminant was added after mixing cnt and pms to examine the mechanism in ngc700 pms system the interaction between ngc700 and pms was investigated firstly pms and ngc700 were mixed for reaction in the solution then bpa was added after regular time intervals if the catalyst could mediate electron transfer between bpa and pms the mixing in advance would show no significant influence on the removal efficiency if ngc700 activated pms for generation of 1o2 the removal efficiency would gradually decrease with longer mixing time as pms and 1o2 were consumed constantly as shown in fig 3d the removal rate of bpa decreased with longer mixing time and the degradation process was sharply inhibited when the mixing time reached to 6 min indicating the consume of pms and the interaction between pms and ngc700 the results further confirmed that 1o2 dominated the oxidation process based our observation the mechanism in ngc700 pms system seems different from cnt pms system yun et al 2017 2018 this should be ascribed to the inherent characteristics of used carbon materials structurally high sp2 hybrid structure and wrapping angle endows cnt with highly graphitic structure which favors electron transfer while in this study ngc700 showed amorphous carbon structure with partial graphitic structure and high nitrogen content fig s1 compositionally n doped carbon is beneficial to generation of 1o2 in pms system which is confirmed by very recent reports huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 3 4 effect of anions on ngc700 pms system anions cl hco3 h2po4 etc play an essential role in pms activation which could react with radicals oh and so4 to form weaker radicals resulting in poor degradation performance clifton 1990 george et al 2006 lutze et al 2015 yang et al 2010 yang et al 2015 the non radical aops could be used to conquer the inhibiting effect of anions and efficiently degrade organic pollutants in saline water as a proof of concept the bpa removal efficiency was investigated in ngc700 pms system with various concentrations of anions fig 4 according to previous reports grebel et al 2010 luo et al 2017a b hco3 showed an abominable effect on pms activation and the inhibitory effect increased with higher hco3 concentration encouragingly for ngc700 pms system the negligible effect was observed and the bpa removal efficiency still maintained at a high level even the hco3 concentration reached to 500 mm fig 4a this result indicates that ngc700 pms is much more efficient than metal pms system toward hco3 with the analogical orderliness the no3 h2po4 had negligible influence on bpa degradation within 500 mm fig 4b c in general the inhibitory effect of anions was attributable to the reaction with radicals oh and so4 to generate weaker radicals we confirmed that ngc700 pms followed the non radical pathway dominated by 1o2 and almost no radicals were produced during the catalytic process fig 3 hence reaction between radicals oh and so4 and anions was avoided which insured the high efficiency of ngc700 pms system with various concentrations of anions cl is pervasive in wastewater and could be readily oxidized by oh and so4 to lower the catalytic performance however the dual effect of cl was reported in pms activation chen et al 2016 wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 the effect of cl on bpa degradation was also investigated in ngc700 pms system interestingly cl markedly facilitated the catalytic process and even the acceleration was enhanced with higher cl concentration fig 4d which was much different from other anions and some reported works lou et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 to further analyze the role of cl the catalytic processes without ngc700 were carried out as shown in fig 5 a the bpa degradation was dramatically enhanced with higher concentration cl when the cl reached to 300 mm the bpa was instantaneously degraded it was in accordance with the degradation performance when 500 mm of cl was added in ngc700 pms system indicating that the catalysis of cl was attributable to the excellent activity the hplc analysis of intermediate products in cl pms system was further performed fig 5b although the removal rate of bpa retention time 4 8 min increased two by products generated gc ms was employed to identify the intermediates three typical peaks labeled as p1 p2 and p3 were observed which matched well with hplc spectra fig 5c moreover the chemical structures of the three compounds were confirmed p1 p2 and p3 were assigned to the peaks of bpa 2 chloro 4 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 propanyl phenol and 4 4 lsopropylidene bis 2 chlorophenol respectively fig 5d the generated reactive cl species during pms oxidation generally is cl or hocl to further investigate the role of cl in ngc700 pms oxidation process the radical scavenger experiments were performed etoh for scavenging oh and so4 hco3 for scavenging cl oh et al 2016 as shown in fig 5e high concentration radical scavengers had no influence on the catalytic activity of cl indicating that almost no radical cl oh and so4 was formed to verify the generation of hocl rbh as a fluorescence probe of hocl was added in cl pms system zhang et al 2011 the result showed that the fluorescence intensity markedly enhanced when cl was present suggesting the generation of hocl fig 5f these results revealed that cl reacted with pms to generate hocl directly which gave rise to the instantaneous degradation of bpa the phenomenon was in accordance with other works to a certain degree wang et al 2011 however the bpa was just converted to other two by products that were not degraded effectively under the cl catalysis fig 5b when the ngc700 and cl were added together the by products were efficiently degraded within 2 min fig s5 the results indicate that cl exhibits a significant synergistic effect on the degradation of the targeted pollutant for ngc700 pms system moreover we changed the bpa to phenol for investigating the synergistic effect of cl only 23 of phenol was degraded when the cl is 500 mm with the presence of pms fig s6 the accelerated degradation was also achieved but much lower than bpa suggesting that the synergistic effect of cl is mainly depended on the intrinsic property of the targeted pollutants 3 5 effect of water quality on the bpa degradation natural organic matters nom are ubiquitous in water which usually shows an adverse impact on the remediation of organic wastewater li et al 2015a b matilainen and sillanpää 2010 humic acid ha as one of typical nom was taken into account in bpa degradation in the ngc700 pms system fig 6 a displays that the presence of ha has a slightly inhibiting effect on the bpa degradation interestingly the inhibiting effect did not further enhance with higher ha concentrations ngc700 pms system the results indicate that ha shows weak reactive activity with 1o2 which could ensure the high degradation efficiency of the target pollutant furthermore the catalytic tests were performed in the tap water and surface water to investigate the integrated effects

that the ngc700 pms system showed the high great resistance to nom and background ions 3 6 reusability tests the reusability tests of the catalyst were performed fig s7 more than 98 of bpa was
