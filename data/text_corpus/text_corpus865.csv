4325,landslide dams often fail shortly after the formation resulting in huge risks to the downstream residents and properties fast and accurate forecasting of the breaching process and discharge hydrograph is important for a decision making to mitigate the damages morphological data indicate that the longitudinal length of most landslide dams is much larger than their transverse length additionally headward erosion is more intense in landslide dams than manmade dams during the overtopping failure process however most existing models neglect this phenomenon the objective of this study is to build up a dam break model considering the headward erosion process assuming that the change rate of downstream slope angle is consistent with the rate of breach vertical erosion and a dam break numerical model to simulate the overtopping failure process of landslide dams considering the headward erosion was developed based on the theories of hydraulics hydrology soil mechanics sediment dynamics and etc nevertheless the breach final bottom elevation which can only be measured after the dam failure is directly applied in currently available dam break models to overcome this problem and for the prediction purpose of a newly formed landslide dam we proposed an empirical model to estimate the breach final bottom elevations of high medium and low erodibility landslide dams based on the statistical analysis of worldwide landslide dam failure cases collected recently to verify the effectiveness of proposed dam break numerical model the 11 03 baige landslide dam which locates at the border of tibet autonomous region and sichuan province was selected as a case study results of this study show that the relative errors in the simulated peak discharge time to the peak and the total flood volume are 1 59 3 50 and 0 53 respectively which meet the accuracy requirements of hydrological forecasting the relative error in the prediction of breach final bottom elevation is 4 28 which indicates that the accuracy of the simulation is satisfactory finally a sensitivity analysis indicates that the downstream slope affects the prediction of the breach and flood hydrograph significantly and the excavation of diversion channel is an effective measure to reduce the peak discharge of dam overtopping failure keywords landslide dam overtopping failure headward erosion breach final bottom elevation 1 introduction extreme weather conditions and natural disasters have become frequent due to the climate change and human activities among them landslides land collapses and debris flows caused by earthquakes rainstorms and other disasters often block the flow of rivers by forming natural dams this blockage can lead to a catastrophic flooding event for example the val pola rock avalanche on july 1987 in sondrio northern italy blocked the valley by forming a landslide dam consequently the evolution of the landslide swept away four villages and killed 22 people govi et al 2002 moreover a powerful 7 6 magnitude earthquake struck kashmir on october 2005 a large composite landslide was reactivated by the earthquake which killed 80 000 people forming a landslide dam at the bottom of the valley and impounding two lakes near the karli and tung rivers additionally the outburst flood of the landslide caused a severe downstream damage schneider 2008 another strong earthquake with a magnitude of 8 on the richter scale occurred in sichuan province china on may 12 2008 it triggered the formation of nearly 257 landslide dams in the upper reaches of the four rivers minjiang tuojiang fujiang and jialingjiang chang et al 2011 cui et al 2009 xu et al 2009 on october 10 and november 3 2018 baige village located on the right bank of the jinsha river which lies on the border between sichuan province and tibet autonomous region of china experienced two successive landslides and river blocking events which resulted in the formation of a large landslide lake the outburst flood put the lives and properties of the downstream people in danger at baiyu county batang county derong county and others cai et al 2020 because of the heterogeneous material composition and loose structure of natural dams they often break shortly after their formation according to the statistics for worldwide landslide dams 27 of them fail within 1 day after their formation 41 fail within 1 week approximately 50 fail within 10 days 80 fail within 6 months and 85 fail within 1 year costa and schuster 1988 therefore rapid and accurate assessments of dam stability breach width and depth of the landslide dam and its outlet flood hydrograph including the peak discharge time to the peak and the total volume of the flood are very important for an urgent decision to mitigate downstream flooding damages in recent years various models for predicting outburst floods caused by the overtopping failure of natural dams have been developed existing dam break models can be classified into statistical parametric and physical models in the statistical model empirical formulas are established based on historical landslide data to simulate the key breaching parameters such as the depth and width of the breach peak discharge and time to the peak etc these models can quickly predict the needed key parameters so far many researchers have proposed such statistical models peng and zhang 2012 wang et al 2015 zhong et al 2020a 2020b however these models cannot reflect the evolution process and also have a shortcoming to consider the failure mechanisms of landslide dams in the parametric model the flood hydrograph is obtained by the equation of broad crested weirs the breach evolution process is simulated assuming that the breach size varies linearly or non linearly with time based on a known final size of the breach and the duration of the dam failure compared with statistical models parametric models can give an evolution process of the breach and flood hydrograph but they still have certain limitations due to that they cannot account for the mechanism of breach development at present parametric models have been widely used in commercial software such as dambrk fread 1984 the physical models are divided into simplified and complicated physical dam break models simplified physical dam break models are developed based on the breaching mechanism of landslide dams in these models the broad crested weir equation is adopted to simulate the breach discharge the erosion formula is used to simulate the erosion process the limit equilibrium method or other slope stability theories are used to analyse the breach slope stability based on these mechanisms the processes of breach evolution and flood hydrograph can be simulated using a numerical iterative method until now many researchers have proposed simplified physical dam break models begam et al 2018 cao et al 2011 chang and zhang 2010 chen et al 2015 do et al 2016 fread 1988 1998 liu et al 2011 singh and quiroga 1988 zhang et al 2019 zhong et al 2017 complicated physical dam break models simulate the hydraulic conditions and erosion process using fundamental differential equations that are intended to fully represent the interactions between hydraulics and erosion they rely entirely on the physical mechanism of dam breaching and are promising for studies on dam break despite involving certain challenges in recent years several complicated physical dam break models have been developed kesserwani et al 2014 marsooli and wu 2015 razavitoosi et al 2014 because of their simplicity rapidness and practicality simplified physical dam break models are the most widely used simulation model however most of these models only assume that the breach widens along the transverse direction and erodes vertically without considering the erosion along the streamwise direction chen et al 2015 fread 1988 1998 singh and quiroga 1988 wang et al 2016 indeed the longitudinal length of a landslide dam is in general significantly larger than its transverse length costa and schuster 1988 in addition many experimental studies have also demonstrated the headward erosion of the lee side slope occurs during the dam breaching according to those studies the downstream edge of the dam advances upstream making the angle of downstream slope gradually smaller during the dam failure process do et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 therefore headward erosion has gradually attracted wide attention chen et al 2020 and zhang et al 2019 divided breach evolution into three erosion stages and assumed that the downstream eroded at a constant slope in the second stage which was inconsistent with the gradual decrease of the downstream slope observed in experimental studies to simulate headward erosion shen et al 2020 and zhong et al 2017 assumed that the downstream toe of the landslide dam was not eroded during breaching and that the downstream slope rotated linearly around a fixed pivot point i e the downstream toe nevertheless their assumptions especially the hypothesis of linearly changing are inconsistent with the experimental phenomenon therefore in this study a dam break numerical model that considers the headward erosion process was proposed in addition the final bottom elevation of the breach is an important input parameter for most dam break models as it is often used to control the vertical erosion of the breach nonetheless many researchers have directly used the final bottom elevation which can only be measured after the dam breaching or assumed final bottom elevation as a direct input parameter of their models chen et al 2015 fread 1984 wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2017 when a new landslide dam is formed accurate prediction of the breaching process will be limited because the final bottom elevation is unknown to resolve this problem an empirical model for estimating the final bottom elevation of the breach was proposed in this study based on recently collected landslide dam failure cases the objective of this study is to develop a dam break numerical model that can consider headward erosion to predict the landslide dam overtopping failure to verify the proposed model the 11 03 baige landslide dam failure which took place at the borders between sichuan province and tibet autonomous region on november 3 2018 was selected as a case study before the simulation the shape of baige landslide dam along the longitudinal direction was represented by a trapezoid with upstream slope and downstream slope a sensitivity analyses was further conducted to study the effects of the generalized upstream and downstream slopes as well as the effectiveness of a diversion channel excavation on the breaching process and flood hydrograph of landslide dam overtopping failure 2 methodology in this study a dam break numerical model was developed to simulate dam breaching process based on the theories of hydraulics hydrology soil mechanics sediment dynamics and so on the numerical model consists of six modules i e the hydrodynamic sediment transport breach evolution headward erosion stability analysis of side slope and estimation of the final bottom elevation 2 1 hydrodynamic module when a landslide dam overtops the water level and the volume of barrier lake will change given the water storage characteristics of the dammed lake as well as the inflow and outlet discharge of the lake according to the water balance principle the change in the volume of barrier lake can be expressed as follow 1 δ w δ t q in q b where q in is the inflow discharge m3 s q b is the outlet discharge of the breach m3 s and δ w is the volume change of barrier lake per time step m3 the water level of landslide lake can be obtained based on the current volume calculated by the equation 1 and the capacity curve of the dammed lake in this paper the transverse shape of landslide dam breach is assumed to be trapezoidal as shown in fig 1 and the breach discharge is calculated using the broad crested weir equation as follow singh 1996 2 q b 1 656 b h z 1 5 1 104 tan α h z 2 5 where b is the breach bottom width m h is the water level of the dammed lake m z is the breach bottom elevation m in fact h z means the water depth above the bottom of the breach i e h h z α is the angle between the breach side slope and the vertical direction and tan α is the breach side slope horizontal vertical in this study the water depth h as shown in fig 1 was calculated based on manning s equation by using newton s iterative method the manning s equation can be written as 3 q b 1 n a 5 3 i 1 2 p 2 3 where i is the hydraulic gradient or energy slope which can be approximately estimated by the slope of breach channel p is the wetted perimeter of the diversion channel m a is the area of the wetted breach section m2 and n is manning s roughness coefficient according to manning s equation the implicit function of water depth can be expressed as follow 4 f h q b n p 2 3 a 5 3 i 1 2 where h is the water depth ft f h is the implicit function of the water depth the first derivative of this function can be expressed as follow 5 f h 2 3 q b n p 1 3 2 cos α 5 3 a 2 3 b 2 tan α h i 1 2 where f h is the first derivative of the water depth function and b is the bottom width of the breach newton s iteration formula for water depth is written as 6 h k 1 h k f h k f h k where h k h k 1 is the approximate solution for f h 0 thus water depth can be calculated by substituting the water depth function and its first derivative in newton s iterative formula and the iterative equation of water depth can be get as follow 7 h k 1 h k q b n p 2 3 a 5 3 i 1 2 2 3 q b n p 1 3 2 cos α 5 3 a 2 3 b 2 tan α h i 1 2 in addition the precision of the iterative calculation performed in this study is 0 001 8 h k 1 h k 0 001 2 2 sediment transport module the materials of landslide dams contain rock and soil grains with a wide range of sizes dunning 2006 chang et al 2011 casagli et al 2003 found that the grain size distribution of the materials is usually bimodal in other words coarse and fine particles are widely distributed consequently the mean particle size d 50 cannot accurately reflect the characteristics of the materials therefore the sediment transport formula of meyer peter and muller as modified by smart 1984 is used to calculate the sediment transport rate 9 q s 3 64 d 90 d 30 0 2 p h 2 3 n s 1 1 hs ω where q s is the sediment transport rate cf s d 30 d 50 d 90 are the grain sizes at which 30 50 and 90 of the total weight consists of the materials respectively mm p is the wetted perimeter of the breach channel ft h is the water depth evaluated by the eq 7 ft s is the slope of the breach channel vertical horizontal and ω is a parameter related to the dam materials and can be estimated by 10 ω 0 0054 τ c d 50 τ c a τ c a cos θ 1 1 54 tan θ θ tan 1 s τ c 0 122 r 0 970 r 3 τ c 0 056 r 0 266 3 r 10 τ c 0 0205 r 0 173 r 10 r 1524 d 50 h s 0 5 for the unity of units the final results estimated by this module with imperial units have been converted into the international units 2 3 breach evolution module vertical and lateral erosion of the breach occur during the overtopping failure process these two erosion processes can be calculated using the breach evolution module based on the law of mass conservation for soil the vertical erosion of the breach can be expressed as follow 11 δ z q s p l 1 p or δ t where δ z is the change in the breach bottom elevation m l is the length of the diversion channel m and p or is the void ratio of the dam materials the rate of lateral enlargement of the breach is related to the material properties and breach flow characteristics passing through the landslide dam or the diversion channel so far there have been few quantitative studies on the relationship between lateral breach enlargement and vertical erosion to simulate lateral breach enlargement its rate is assumed to be the same as that of vertical erosion as shown in fig 2 in which lateral erosion within a time step can be expressed as δ b 2 δ b 2 b 1 b 2 on the basis of geometrical relation as shown in fig 2 the lateral erosion can be calculated as follow 12 δ b 2 δ z sec α tan α where δ b is the change in the breach width defined at the channel bed as shown in fig 2 m 2 4 headward erosion module in recent years experimental studies have revealed evidently the headward erosion during the overtopping flow passing through the breach do et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 these studies have shown that the slope angle of downstream side gradually decreases as the dam failure process but no quantitative formulae are available to estimate the changes based on these experimental results and observations jiang et al 2016 the headward erosion can be generalized as shown in fig 3 although the downstream side of the dam eroded with a variable slope compared with the vertical erosion its differences with the rate of vertical erosion are not noticeable we assume currently that the change rate of the slope angle is consistent with the rate of vertical erosion therefore we can have β 0 β i β 0 β end z 0 z i z 0 z end with these assumptions the slope angle of downstream side can be estimated by following equation 13 β i β 0 z 0 z i z 0 z end β 0 β end where z 0 is the initial bottom elevation of the breach m z i is the bottom elevation of the breach at time step i m z end is the final bottom elevation of the breach m β 0 is the initial angle of the downstream slope β i is the angle of the downstream slope at time step i and β end is the final angle of the downstream slope when the downstream slope angle is available and according to the trigonometric function presented in fig 3 b the length of diversion channel in a time step can be expressed as follow 14 l i l 1 z i z 1 tan β i z i z 1 tan β up where z 1 is the bottom elevation of the dam m l 1 is the bottom length of the dam in the streamwise direction m l i is the length of diversion channel at time step i m and β up is the angle of the upstream slope 2 5 stability analysis module of side slope the side slopes of the breach may collapse suddenly during the breaching which is the secondly important mechanism controlling the lateral enlargement of the breach therefore the method of analysing the stability of side slope as presented by spangler 1951 is used in this study fig 4 illustrates the stability analysis in which a collapse occurs when the actual cut down depth of the breach reaches the critical depth i e h k h k the critical depth is a function of the material properties of the dam and can be calculated as follows 15 h k 4 c cos ϕ sin θ k 1 γ 1 cos θ k 1 ϕ 16 θ k θ k 1 ϕ 2 h k ϕ γ θ k considering the supporting effect of breach channel flow on the side slope stability of the breach one third of the water depth is taken into account for the supporting effect as treated by fread 1988 therefore the cut down depth of the breach can be estimated by the equation 17 h k z up z h 3 where h k is the actual cut down depth of the breach m and z up is the top elevation of the dam m and z is the same as zi indicated in eq 13 it is assumed that erosion occurs equally along the bottom and sides of the breach except when the sides of the breach collapse consequently the breach bottom does not continue to erode downwards until the volume of collapsed material along the breach is completely removed the volume of the collapsed materials along the breach can be estimated as follows 18 δ v z up z 2 tan α i tan α i 1 l where δ v is the volume of collapsed materials m3 and α is the angle between the slope side and the vertical direction of the transverse breach channel if the slope of breach channel collapses the value of α will change with the change of θ k as shown in the eq 18 otherwise the α will keep unchanged 2 6 estimation module of the final bottom elevation the final bottom elevation of the breach which controls its vertical erosion as shown in eq 13 and fig 3 is an important input parameter for the most of available dam break models however this value which can only be obtained through a field investigation after the failure of landslide dam is directly put into the simulation by those models chen et al 2015 fread 1984 wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2017 for the convenience of prediction it should be estimated appropriately in advance according to the failure cases of landslide dams collected peng and zhang 2012 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 and the erosion category proposed by briaud et al 2008 regression analysis of the dam height and the breach depth with high medium and low erodibility was performed in this study empirical formulae to evaluate the final bottom elevation with different erodibility was developed subsequently the erosion category reflects the erodibility of the soil which is mainly related to factors such as the type compactness weight and particle size of the soil in general sandy soil has higher erodibility than clay soil with high compactness high weight and large particles has lower erodibility briaud et al 2008 proposed six erosion categories i e very high high medium low and very low erodibility as well as non erosive based on the erosion rate flow velocity or shear stress for the conveniences of estimation in this study erodibility is simply classified into three categories namely high medium and low based on the study conducted by briaud et al 2008 more than 1 200 worldwide failure cases of landslide dams zhang et al 2016 shi et al 2014 peng and zhang 2012 etc were collected to establish a database in which only 22 cases include detailed breaching information as shown in table 1 the preservation ratio of a landslide dam is the ratio of the residual dam height to the initial dam height based on the data in table 1 regression analysis of the dam heights and the breach depths with high medium and low erodibility was performed the quality of regression is indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 results of the regression analysis are as shown in fig 5 and table 2 it can be seen that the r2 values of the empirical equations for estimating the breach depth of landslide dams with high medium and low erodibility are 0 90 0 72 and 0 75 respectively these values indicate a relatively high goodness of fit in addition we can get that the higher the erodibility the smaller is the average preservation ratio which can further explain the applicability of the estimation module obtained in this study 2 7 calculation flow chart based on these six modules the landslide dam overtopping failure process can be simulated using the numerical iterative method the key breach related parameters including the discharge water level of the dammed lake breach bottom elevation breach width diversion channel length and etc can be obtained at each time step by the flow chart of numerical simulation as shown in fig 6 3 case study 3 1 study area at 22 06 october 10 and 17 40 on november 3 in 2018 baige village which lies on the right bank of the jinsha river at the border between sichuan province and tibet autonomous region of china experienced two successive landslides and river blocking events which took place at the same site and resulted in the formation of a large landslide lake detailed location of the event is shown in fig 7 detailed river blocking conditions formed on october 10 are indicated in fig 8 about 17 40 on november 3 2018 more than 3 7 million m3 of collapsed materials stacked over the previously formed landslide dam in the jinsha river channel creating an even larger barrier lake the second flooding due to the overtopping failure of the dam caused substantial damage to roads bridges farmland houses and water conservancyfacilities within the affected downstream areas of tibet sichuan and yunnan provinces cai et al 2020 according to the official report of the disaster reduction committee of yunnan province about 54 000 people were affected in diqing lijiang and dali counties 41 000 people were relocated more than 3 000 houses and 3 000 ha of farmland were damaged resulting in direct economic losses up to 7 4 billion yuan the flooding of the 11 03 baige landslide dam overtopping failure was very large and serous the peak discharge observed from the outlet of the breach reached to 31 000 m3 s in order to evaluate the accuracy of the model proposed in this study and also for the prediction purpose of similar events in the future the 11 03 baige landslide dam was selected as a case study 3 2 landslide dam condition after the formation of the 11 03 baige landslide dam the upstream water level rose rapidly according to an official report by the hydrological bureau of ganzi at 08 00 on november 8 the water level of the gangtuo hydrological station which is approximately 90 km upstream of the baige landslide dam was 3571 68 m with a discharge of 617 m3 s while at the barrier lake inflow rate was approximately 780 m3 s the storage capacity of the lake was approximately 321 million m3 with a corresponding water level of 2937 11 m and the water level increased with a rate of 0 22 m h according to the information collected without human intervention the water level of the dammed lake would rise to an elevation of 2966 m at 08 00 on november 15 to reduce the upstream inundation and the damage to the downstream regions at approximately 17 00 on november 8 excavation of the drainage channel was commenced at the left side of the previously breached landslide dam at 19 00 on november 11 the excavation was completed and the drainage channel had a length of 220 m in the streamwise direction the average depth bottom width and side slope of the excavated channel were 13 5 m 3 m and 1 1 3 respectively at 10 00 on november 12 the dammed lake began to discharge gradually based on the related document on the failure process of the 11 03 baige landslide dam and the data of field survey presented by cai et al 2020 the input parameters of this study were collected and given in table 3 it should be noted that the field measurement of breach final bottom elevation was 2905 8 m which is derived from zhong et al 2020b however the estimated value of 2903 8 m was listed in the table 3 because we want to check the applicability of the equation proposed for the estimation in this study the final bottom elevation was determined using the proposed empirical model and the calculated value was 2903 8 m the simulation process is as follows first based on the erodibility categories proposed by briaud et al 2008 the baige landslide dam belonged to the high erodibility category the empirical formula for a high erodibility landslide dam i e hb 0 2290hd 29 788 was used to calculate the breach depth of the baige landslide dam according to the calculation the breach depth was 48 7 m hence the final bottom elevation of the breach can be estimated by the difference of initial bottom elevation of 2952 5 m and the breach depth calculated namely 2952 5 48 7 2903 8 m which was used for the simulation and also listed in table 3 the absolute error in the estimation of the final bottom elevation of the breach was 2 m comparing with the field measurement of 2905 8 m and the relative error was 4 28 this predicted value adequately validates the accuracy of the proposed estimation module of the final bottom elevation in this study fig 9 presents the longitudinal profile of the 11 03 baige landslide dam zhang et al 2019 and fig 10 depicts the capacity water level curve of the 11 03 baige dammed lake cai et al 2019 furthermore fig 11 the grain size distributions of the 11 03 baige landslide dam 4 results and discussion according to the surveyed data in table 3 and taking 0 00o clock on november 13 of 2018 as the starting point of the numerical simulation the overtopping failure process of the 11 03 baige landslide dam was simulated using the proposed dam break model in this study simulated results are as shown in figs 12 14 which represent the variation processes of discharge water level of the barrier lake and breach width respectively in order to the accuracy of the proposed model the observed data based on the official documents are also given in these figures which are indicated by the dot points or description in the figures as for the breach width evolution in fig 14 it is assumed in the model that the width will not be changed when the breach shape is approximately reaching to the original river conditions because the breach final shape is mainly controlled by the original river morphology the material properties of baige landslide dam and the inflow and outflow conditions of the barrier lake in order to have a general impression about the accuracy of the dam break numerical model proposed in this study the main parameter comparisons regarding the breach and flow between the simulated and the measured data are summarized in table 4 it can be seen from the table that the simulated peak discharge is 30 508 m3 s while the measured is 31 000 m3 s and the relative error is only 1 59 the simulated time to the peak discharge is 38 min later than the measured and the relative error is only 3 5 the errors of the simulated flood volume breach bottom width and top width compared with the measured are totally less than 7 all of the main parameters of the breach and flow are quite satisfactory on the basis of table 4 and fig 12 then how about the flow process of breach outlet further comparison is conducted and the results are given in table 5 based on the flood hydrograph simulated it can be seen from the table 5 that the simulated flow process from the breach outlet is also in good agreement with the measured process and the averaged flow error is 18 2 which is within the requirements of related regulation or code for hydrological forecast in china among them the relative error of the discharge simulated at the point of the first rising stage namely at 15 00of november 13 is big up to 50 3 there are several reasons which can lead to the large error at this point firstly some errors may be existed in the storage capacity curve and the estimation formula of discharge adopted in the model secondly the model takes 0 00o clock on november 13 as the starting point of simulation and the initial water level and other input parameters estimated at that time are not accurate because there is no hydrological station and an accurate data observed is not available when the model calculated at 15 00on november 13 the undercutting rate of the breach maybe large and lead the large difference of the discharge however only the peak discharge and the time to the peak are generally regarded as the most important for the flood damage controlling of downstream regions while the discharge at the initial rising stage in a large river like jinsha river is not so important because the simulated discharge of 7 813 m3 s is a little bit bigger than the annual averaged discharge if this point is not taken into account the averaged error of flood hydrograph simulated will be lowered to 14 6 regarding to the change of water level and the breach development we can find that the simulated processes of water level and the breach are also in good agreement with the measured data as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 therefore the dam break numerical model proposed can well reproduce the whole overtopping failure process of baige landslide dam which has further verified the accuracy and rationality of the model developed in this study 4 1 comparison with model without considering headward erosion several experimental studies have shown that headward erosion is an obvious phenomenon during the overtopping failure of landslide dams it cannot be ignored to build up a numerical model therefore we considered it in our model in order to evaluate its impact on dam breaching the 11 03 baige landslide dam was selected as a case study results obtained by the proposed model were compared with those without considering headward erosion figs 15 and 16 present the calculated longitudinal profiles with and without headward erosion respectively it can be seen that during the dam break failure process the downstream slope of the dam gradually decreases and the length of breach channel gradually changes based on the model with headward erosion the results can reveal properly the experimental results by jiang et al 2016 however the downstream slope of the dam will not change and the length of breach channel will gradually increase based on the model without considering headward erosion in order to further explain the necessity of considering headward erosion for the simulation on overtopping failure of the natural dams comparison has also been conducted for the breaching parameters and flood hydrograph by the models with and without headward erosion details of the comparison are shown in fig 17 and table 6 as shown in table 6 the relative errors of the peak discharge time to the peak total flood volume and the final top and bottom widths of the breach simulated by the model proposed in this study are less than those resulted from the model without considering headward erosion fig 17 a compares the horizontal length variation of diversion channel simulated by the two models based on the model developed in this study to consider headward erosion the length will gradually increase and finally reach to a stable length of 322 m at 19 01 on november 13 2018 this is because the breach final bottom elevation is estimated in advance and the headward erosion and vertical erosion will be stopped during the simulation process this is reasonable because it takes place after the time to the peck which is at18 38o clock on november 13 based on table 5 however in the model without consider headward erosion the length will continuously increase until the end of simulation and finally reach to 605 m at 0 00o clock on november 15 2018 this is not reasonable because there always has a residual section of landslide dam which corresponds to the breach final bottom elevation when an overtopping failure had taken place as for the flood process of breach and water level variation of the barrier lake simulated results by the two models are indicated in fig 17 b and c respectively as shown in fig 17 b and c the peak discharge will be quite smaller time to the peak will be delayed flood hydrograph will be widened change rate of the water level in the lake will be smaller and water level will maintain a higher water level when the model without considering headward erosion is used to simulate the failure process however when the proposed model to consider the headward erosion is used the calculated flood hydrograph and water level of the barrier lake agree well with the measured data as displayed in figs 12 and 13 and table 5 the reason for the differences is that when headward erosion is not considered the horizontal length of channel simulated will gradually and continuously increase during the erosion process and exceed the actual length of channel resulting in a decrease in the rates of lateral enlargement and vertical erosion therefore the calculated breach bottom elevation will be higher and the breach bottom width will be smaller as shown in fig 17 d and e respectively due to the slower rate of vertical erosion and the smaller width the discharging capacity of the channel will be decreased the water level of the dammed lake will be lowered slowly and maintain a higher water level as shown in fig 17 c the water head will be smaller as shown in fig 17 f due to the breach bottom elevation is higher based on the analysis headward erosion is very important for the prediction of landslide dam overtopping failure furthermore the proposed numerical model in this study can be applied to accurately predict the entire failure process 4 2 sensitivity analysis regarding the numerical study on the overtopping failure of landslide dams it is a prerequisite to generalize in advance the shape of a landslide dam which include the upstream and downstream slopes of dams if headward erosion has to be taken into account this generalization may lead to an influence on the simulated results in the development of breach and flood hydrograph in this study we proposed a numerical model to deal with headward erosion process and a satisfactory result have been achieved to further elucidate the applicability of the proposed model and the influence of the generalization sensitivity analyses were conducted on the generalization of upstream and downstream slopes for the conciseness we only give the simulated results of flood related parameters namely the peak discharge and the time to the peak in the sensitive analysis in addition as it may well know that the excavation of diversion channel is an effective measure to reduce flooding damages in the downstream region due to overtopping failure how effective will it be therefore in our case study of 11 03 baige overtopping failure event both with and without the diversion channel were also investigated 4 2 1 impact of upstream slope the upstream slope of the dam was changed from original 20 to 18 19 21 and 22 to investigate its effects while other parameters were remained unchanged the dam overtopping failure process was simulated by the model proposed in this study table 7 shows the corresponding changes in the peak discharge and time to the peak due to the slope angle variation based on the available documents of the landslide dam it is assumed that the upstream slope 20 of the dam is appropriate the peak discharges simulated with different angles don t change greatly as shown in table 7 the biggest difference is the case with an upstream slope angle of 18 and the relative error is 6 86 compared with the observed discharge of 31 000 m3 s and the time to the peak will be delayed generally for all cases however the delay will be shortened gradually with the increase of upstream slope angles the maximum delayed are also the case with an upstream slope angle of 18 which has a time delay of 0 73 h in general the simulated results indicate that as the upstream slope increases the predicted peak discharge will be increased slightly and the time to the peak will be delayed for all cases but the delay will be less with the increases of upstream slope angles fig 18 presents a comparison of flood hydrographs for different upstream slopes the results indicate that the flow hydrograph will be taller and thinner as the upstream slope increases in addition the time to the peak will be delayed generally speaking results of this sensitive analysis demonstrate that the peak discharge and time to the peak are less sensitive to the change of upstream slope angles 4 2 2 impact of downstream slope to investigate the effect of the downstream slope the slope was varied from original 10 to 8 9 11 and 12 while other parameters were remained unchanged the overtopping failure process was simulated again using the proposed model table 8 gives the corresponding changes in the peak discharge and time to the peak which are the most important two characteristic parameters of flood hydrograph the results in the table 8 indicate that as the downstream slope increases the predicted peak discharge will be increased rapidly for instance when the angle varied from 10 to 12 the peak discharge changed will be increased from 30 508 m3 s to 37 437 m3 s with an increment of 6 929 m3 s the relative error can reach to 20 76 when compared with the measured 31 000 m3 s as for the predicted time to the peak all of the cases are also delayed but the delay will be reduced quickly with the increase of downstream slope fig 19 presents a comparison of flood hydrographs for different downstream slopes the results show that as the predefined downstream slope increases the predicted flood hydrograph will be taller and thinner which are the same as the changing situation of upstream slope angles this trend may be explained by the fact that if the downstream slope is steeper the velocity of dam break flow will be faster and lead to a rapid undercutting of the downstream slope these results demonstrate that the peak discharge and time to the peak are quite sensitive to the downstream slope especially the peak discharge in addition they are more sensitive to the downstream slope than to the upstream slope which indicates that giving a reasonable and accurate downstream slope is significant for overtopping failure simulation of landslide dams by the model proposed in this study in order to further investigate the influence of initial downstream slope angle on the overtopping failure process the simulated change rate of downstream slope angle and the change rate of channel length under different initial downstream slope angles are analysed results are as shown in figs 20 and 21 respectively it can be seen from fig 20 that the larger the initial downstream slope angle is the greater the change rate of downstream slope angle is the change rate of breach channel length is the change amount of channel length per time step it is worth noting that when the channel length at a given time step is smaller than that at the previous time step the change rate of channel length at that time step is positive otherwise it is negative it can be seen from fig 21 that when the initial downstream slope is 12 11 10 the change rate of channel length is always positive indicating that the channel length is gradually decreasing in the breaking process at the same time the larger the initial downstream slope angle is the greater the change rate of channel length is at each time step namely the greater the rate of headward erosion is however at the initial downstream slope of 9 and 8 it can be seen that the change rate of the channel length is always negative indicating that the channel length is gradually increasing in general the larger the initial downstream slope angle is the greater the change rate of downstream slope angle is in the process of dam break and the stronger the erosion rate is which leads to the greater change rate of channel length and the greater the flood discharge therefore the change of downstream slope is dominant rather than the change of channel length when the initial downstream slope angle is predefined 4 2 3 impact of diversion channel excavation excavation of diversion channels is a common and effective measure to reduce the downstream flood damages due to the overtopping failure of landslide dams how effective will it be to evaluate its effects the model proposed in this study also used for this purpose the initial elevation of the breach bottom was assigned to the value of 2966 m which was the top elevation of the 11 03 baige landslide dam the estimated starting time of natural overtopping failure would be approximately at 08 00 on november 15th according to the inflow situation of the barrier lake other parameters for the simulation were remained unchanged simulated results of the main breach characteristic parameters with and without the diversion channel are as shown in table 9 while the flood hydrographs are indicated in fig 22 as shown in table 9 without a diversion channel simulated time to the peak would occur at 01 26 on november 16th the peak discharge would be raised up approximately to 46 668 m3 s and the total flood volume would be about 762 million m3 if comparing it with that of diversion channel the time to peak would be delayed by approximately 55 h the peak discharge would be 1 5 times larger the total flood volume would be nearly 1 4 times larger and the final breach width would also be larger as shown in table 9 these trends occur because excavation of diversion channel can discharge or empty the barrier lake as earlier as possible so that the scale of flooding due to overtopping failure of landslide dams can be artificially reduced in advance therefore the excavation of diversion channel can play a significant role to mitigate flood damage substantially when condition permits a diversion channel should be excavated as earlier as possible once a gigantic landslide dam takes place in a larger river 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a dam break numerical model to deal with the headward erosion which is obvious and has a significant influence on the breaching and flood hydrograph of landslide dam overtopping failure but it is seldom considered in current available dam break models the proposed model consists of six modules hydrodynamic module sediment transport module breach evolution module headward erosion module stability analysis module of side slope and estimation module of the final bottom elevation a case study of the 11 03 baige landslide dam with a large barrier lake was conducted the results obtained by the model proposed were compared with the measured data and those of the model without headward erosion relative errors between the predicted and the measured flood and breach parameters such as peak discharge time to the peak total flood volume final breach width and etc are all within 7 which demonstrates that the rationality and accuracy of the model proposed in this study are satisfactory in addition an empirical model for estimating the final bottom elevation of high medium and low erodibility landslide dams was developed this model can solve the problem of using the measured value of breach final bottom elevation directly into the dam break numerical simulation for most existing models to predict newly formed landslide dam failure process in the case study of the 11 03 baige landslide dam the relative error of the breach final bottom elevation estimated is 4 2 compared with the field observation that is to say the rationality of the proposed empirical formula is acceptable furthermore a sensitivity analysis was conducted for parameters such as the upstream and downstream slopes during the shape generalization of landslide dam additionally the effectiveness of diversion channel excavation has also been investigated results of the sensitive analysis demonstrate that the breach and flood parameters are more sensitive to the downstream slope than to the upstream slope in which the downstream slope has a greater impact on the flood hydrograph excavation of a diversion channel can reduce substantially the peak discharge of the flood hydrograph because it can discharge the barrier lake as earlier as possible therefore diversion channel excavation is an effective measure to mitigate the flood tragedy of landslide dam failure in summary the dam break numerical model proposed in this study can reasonably predict the overtopping failure of landslide dams however as the mechanism of headward erosion is not understand completely uncertainties still remain further studies and applications are desired for the improvement of the proposed model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4325,landslide dams often fail shortly after the formation resulting in huge risks to the downstream residents and properties fast and accurate forecasting of the breaching process and discharge hydrograph is important for a decision making to mitigate the damages morphological data indicate that the longitudinal length of most landslide dams is much larger than their transverse length additionally headward erosion is more intense in landslide dams than manmade dams during the overtopping failure process however most existing models neglect this phenomenon the objective of this study is to build up a dam break model considering the headward erosion process assuming that the change rate of downstream slope angle is consistent with the rate of breach vertical erosion and a dam break numerical model to simulate the overtopping failure process of landslide dams considering the headward erosion was developed based on the theories of hydraulics hydrology soil mechanics sediment dynamics and etc nevertheless the breach final bottom elevation which can only be measured after the dam failure is directly applied in currently available dam break models to overcome this problem and for the prediction purpose of a newly formed landslide dam we proposed an empirical model to estimate the breach final bottom elevations of high medium and low erodibility landslide dams based on the statistical analysis of worldwide landslide dam failure cases collected recently to verify the effectiveness of proposed dam break numerical model the 11 03 baige landslide dam which locates at the border of tibet autonomous region and sichuan province was selected as a case study results of this study show that the relative errors in the simulated peak discharge time to the peak and the total flood volume are 1 59 3 50 and 0 53 respectively which meet the accuracy requirements of hydrological forecasting the relative error in the prediction of breach final bottom elevation is 4 28 which indicates that the accuracy of the simulation is satisfactory finally a sensitivity analysis indicates that the downstream slope affects the prediction of the breach and flood hydrograph significantly and the excavation of diversion channel is an effective measure to reduce the peak discharge of dam overtopping failure keywords landslide dam overtopping failure headward erosion breach final bottom elevation 1 introduction extreme weather conditions and natural disasters have become frequent due to the climate change and human activities among them landslides land collapses and debris flows caused by earthquakes rainstorms and other disasters often block the flow of rivers by forming natural dams this blockage can lead to a catastrophic flooding event for example the val pola rock avalanche on july 1987 in sondrio northern italy blocked the valley by forming a landslide dam consequently the evolution of the landslide swept away four villages and killed 22 people govi et al 2002 moreover a powerful 7 6 magnitude earthquake struck kashmir on october 2005 a large composite landslide was reactivated by the earthquake which killed 80 000 people forming a landslide dam at the bottom of the valley and impounding two lakes near the karli and tung rivers additionally the outburst flood of the landslide caused a severe downstream damage schneider 2008 another strong earthquake with a magnitude of 8 on the richter scale occurred in sichuan province china on may 12 2008 it triggered the formation of nearly 257 landslide dams in the upper reaches of the four rivers minjiang tuojiang fujiang and jialingjiang chang et al 2011 cui et al 2009 xu et al 2009 on october 10 and november 3 2018 baige village located on the right bank of the jinsha river which lies on the border between sichuan province and tibet autonomous region of china experienced two successive landslides and river blocking events which resulted in the formation of a large landslide lake the outburst flood put the lives and properties of the downstream people in danger at baiyu county batang county derong county and others cai et al 2020 because of the heterogeneous material composition and loose structure of natural dams they often break shortly after their formation according to the statistics for worldwide landslide dams 27 of them fail within 1 day after their formation 41 fail within 1 week approximately 50 fail within 10 days 80 fail within 6 months and 85 fail within 1 year costa and schuster 1988 therefore rapid and accurate assessments of dam stability breach width and depth of the landslide dam and its outlet flood hydrograph including the peak discharge time to the peak and the total volume of the flood are very important for an urgent decision to mitigate downstream flooding damages in recent years various models for predicting outburst floods caused by the overtopping failure of natural dams have been developed existing dam break models can be classified into statistical parametric and physical models in the statistical model empirical formulas are established based on historical landslide data to simulate the key breaching parameters such as the depth and width of the breach peak discharge and time to the peak etc these models can quickly predict the needed key parameters so far many researchers have proposed such statistical models peng and zhang 2012 wang et al 2015 zhong et al 2020a 2020b however these models cannot reflect the evolution process and also have a shortcoming to consider the failure mechanisms of landslide dams in the parametric model the flood hydrograph is obtained by the equation of broad crested weirs the breach evolution process is simulated assuming that the breach size varies linearly or non linearly with time based on a known final size of the breach and the duration of the dam failure compared with statistical models parametric models can give an evolution process of the breach and flood hydrograph but they still have certain limitations due to that they cannot account for the mechanism of breach development at present parametric models have been widely used in commercial software such as dambrk fread 1984 the physical models are divided into simplified and complicated physical dam break models simplified physical dam break models are developed based on the breaching mechanism of landslide dams in these models the broad crested weir equation is adopted to simulate the breach discharge the erosion formula is used to simulate the erosion process the limit equilibrium method or other slope stability theories are used to analyse the breach slope stability based on these mechanisms the processes of breach evolution and flood hydrograph can be simulated using a numerical iterative method until now many researchers have proposed simplified physical dam break models begam et al 2018 cao et al 2011 chang and zhang 2010 chen et al 2015 do et al 2016 fread 1988 1998 liu et al 2011 singh and quiroga 1988 zhang et al 2019 zhong et al 2017 complicated physical dam break models simulate the hydraulic conditions and erosion process using fundamental differential equations that are intended to fully represent the interactions between hydraulics and erosion they rely entirely on the physical mechanism of dam breaching and are promising for studies on dam break despite involving certain challenges in recent years several complicated physical dam break models have been developed kesserwani et al 2014 marsooli and wu 2015 razavitoosi et al 2014 because of their simplicity rapidness and practicality simplified physical dam break models are the most widely used simulation model however most of these models only assume that the breach widens along the transverse direction and erodes vertically without considering the erosion along the streamwise direction chen et al 2015 fread 1988 1998 singh and quiroga 1988 wang et al 2016 indeed the longitudinal length of a landslide dam is in general significantly larger than its transverse length costa and schuster 1988 in addition many experimental studies have also demonstrated the headward erosion of the lee side slope occurs during the dam breaching according to those studies the downstream edge of the dam advances upstream making the angle of downstream slope gradually smaller during the dam failure process do et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 therefore headward erosion has gradually attracted wide attention chen et al 2020 and zhang et al 2019 divided breach evolution into three erosion stages and assumed that the downstream eroded at a constant slope in the second stage which was inconsistent with the gradual decrease of the downstream slope observed in experimental studies to simulate headward erosion shen et al 2020 and zhong et al 2017 assumed that the downstream toe of the landslide dam was not eroded during breaching and that the downstream slope rotated linearly around a fixed pivot point i e the downstream toe nevertheless their assumptions especially the hypothesis of linearly changing are inconsistent with the experimental phenomenon therefore in this study a dam break numerical model that considers the headward erosion process was proposed in addition the final bottom elevation of the breach is an important input parameter for most dam break models as it is often used to control the vertical erosion of the breach nonetheless many researchers have directly used the final bottom elevation which can only be measured after the dam breaching or assumed final bottom elevation as a direct input parameter of their models chen et al 2015 fread 1984 wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2017 when a new landslide dam is formed accurate prediction of the breaching process will be limited because the final bottom elevation is unknown to resolve this problem an empirical model for estimating the final bottom elevation of the breach was proposed in this study based on recently collected landslide dam failure cases the objective of this study is to develop a dam break numerical model that can consider headward erosion to predict the landslide dam overtopping failure to verify the proposed model the 11 03 baige landslide dam failure which took place at the borders between sichuan province and tibet autonomous region on november 3 2018 was selected as a case study before the simulation the shape of baige landslide dam along the longitudinal direction was represented by a trapezoid with upstream slope and downstream slope a sensitivity analyses was further conducted to study the effects of the generalized upstream and downstream slopes as well as the effectiveness of a diversion channel excavation on the breaching process and flood hydrograph of landslide dam overtopping failure 2 methodology in this study a dam break numerical model was developed to simulate dam breaching process based on the theories of hydraulics hydrology soil mechanics sediment dynamics and so on the numerical model consists of six modules i e the hydrodynamic sediment transport breach evolution headward erosion stability analysis of side slope and estimation of the final bottom elevation 2 1 hydrodynamic module when a landslide dam overtops the water level and the volume of barrier lake will change given the water storage characteristics of the dammed lake as well as the inflow and outlet discharge of the lake according to the water balance principle the change in the volume of barrier lake can be expressed as follow 1 δ w δ t q in q b where q in is the inflow discharge m3 s q b is the outlet discharge of the breach m3 s and δ w is the volume change of barrier lake per time step m3 the water level of landslide lake can be obtained based on the current volume calculated by the equation 1 and the capacity curve of the dammed lake in this paper the transverse shape of landslide dam breach is assumed to be trapezoidal as shown in fig 1 and the breach discharge is calculated using the broad crested weir equation as follow singh 1996 2 q b 1 656 b h z 1 5 1 104 tan α h z 2 5 where b is the breach bottom width m h is the water level of the dammed lake m z is the breach bottom elevation m in fact h z means the water depth above the bottom of the breach i e h h z α is the angle between the breach side slope and the vertical direction and tan α is the breach side slope horizontal vertical in this study the water depth h as shown in fig 1 was calculated based on manning s equation by using newton s iterative method the manning s equation can be written as 3 q b 1 n a 5 3 i 1 2 p 2 3 where i is the hydraulic gradient or energy slope which can be approximately estimated by the slope of breach channel p is the wetted perimeter of the diversion channel m a is the area of the wetted breach section m2 and n is manning s roughness coefficient according to manning s equation the implicit function of water depth can be expressed as follow 4 f h q b n p 2 3 a 5 3 i 1 2 where h is the water depth ft f h is the implicit function of the water depth the first derivative of this function can be expressed as follow 5 f h 2 3 q b n p 1 3 2 cos α 5 3 a 2 3 b 2 tan α h i 1 2 where f h is the first derivative of the water depth function and b is the bottom width of the breach newton s iteration formula for water depth is written as 6 h k 1 h k f h k f h k where h k h k 1 is the approximate solution for f h 0 thus water depth can be calculated by substituting the water depth function and its first derivative in newton s iterative formula and the iterative equation of water depth can be get as follow 7 h k 1 h k q b n p 2 3 a 5 3 i 1 2 2 3 q b n p 1 3 2 cos α 5 3 a 2 3 b 2 tan α h i 1 2 in addition the precision of the iterative calculation performed in this study is 0 001 8 h k 1 h k 0 001 2 2 sediment transport module the materials of landslide dams contain rock and soil grains with a wide range of sizes dunning 2006 chang et al 2011 casagli et al 2003 found that the grain size distribution of the materials is usually bimodal in other words coarse and fine particles are widely distributed consequently the mean particle size d 50 cannot accurately reflect the characteristics of the materials therefore the sediment transport formula of meyer peter and muller as modified by smart 1984 is used to calculate the sediment transport rate 9 q s 3 64 d 90 d 30 0 2 p h 2 3 n s 1 1 hs ω where q s is the sediment transport rate cf s d 30 d 50 d 90 are the grain sizes at which 30 50 and 90 of the total weight consists of the materials respectively mm p is the wetted perimeter of the breach channel ft h is the water depth evaluated by the eq 7 ft s is the slope of the breach channel vertical horizontal and ω is a parameter related to the dam materials and can be estimated by 10 ω 0 0054 τ c d 50 τ c a τ c a cos θ 1 1 54 tan θ θ tan 1 s τ c 0 122 r 0 970 r 3 τ c 0 056 r 0 266 3 r 10 τ c 0 0205 r 0 173 r 10 r 1524 d 50 h s 0 5 for the unity of units the final results estimated by this module with imperial units have been converted into the international units 2 3 breach evolution module vertical and lateral erosion of the breach occur during the overtopping failure process these two erosion processes can be calculated using the breach evolution module based on the law of mass conservation for soil the vertical erosion of the breach can be expressed as follow 11 δ z q s p l 1 p or δ t where δ z is the change in the breach bottom elevation m l is the length of the diversion channel m and p or is the void ratio of the dam materials the rate of lateral enlargement of the breach is related to the material properties and breach flow characteristics passing through the landslide dam or the diversion channel so far there have been few quantitative studies on the relationship between lateral breach enlargement and vertical erosion to simulate lateral breach enlargement its rate is assumed to be the same as that of vertical erosion as shown in fig 2 in which lateral erosion within a time step can be expressed as δ b 2 δ b 2 b 1 b 2 on the basis of geometrical relation as shown in fig 2 the lateral erosion can be calculated as follow 12 δ b 2 δ z sec α tan α where δ b is the change in the breach width defined at the channel bed as shown in fig 2 m 2 4 headward erosion module in recent years experimental studies have revealed evidently the headward erosion during the overtopping flow passing through the breach do et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 yu et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 these studies have shown that the slope angle of downstream side gradually decreases as the dam failure process but no quantitative formulae are available to estimate the changes based on these experimental results and observations jiang et al 2016 the headward erosion can be generalized as shown in fig 3 although the downstream side of the dam eroded with a variable slope compared with the vertical erosion its differences with the rate of vertical erosion are not noticeable we assume currently that the change rate of the slope angle is consistent with the rate of vertical erosion therefore we can have β 0 β i β 0 β end z 0 z i z 0 z end with these assumptions the slope angle of downstream side can be estimated by following equation 13 β i β 0 z 0 z i z 0 z end β 0 β end where z 0 is the initial bottom elevation of the breach m z i is the bottom elevation of the breach at time step i m z end is the final bottom elevation of the breach m β 0 is the initial angle of the downstream slope β i is the angle of the downstream slope at time step i and β end is the final angle of the downstream slope when the downstream slope angle is available and according to the trigonometric function presented in fig 3 b the length of diversion channel in a time step can be expressed as follow 14 l i l 1 z i z 1 tan β i z i z 1 tan β up where z 1 is the bottom elevation of the dam m l 1 is the bottom length of the dam in the streamwise direction m l i is the length of diversion channel at time step i m and β up is the angle of the upstream slope 2 5 stability analysis module of side slope the side slopes of the breach may collapse suddenly during the breaching which is the secondly important mechanism controlling the lateral enlargement of the breach therefore the method of analysing the stability of side slope as presented by spangler 1951 is used in this study fig 4 illustrates the stability analysis in which a collapse occurs when the actual cut down depth of the breach reaches the critical depth i e h k h k the critical depth is a function of the material properties of the dam and can be calculated as follows 15 h k 4 c cos ϕ sin θ k 1 γ 1 cos θ k 1 ϕ 16 θ k θ k 1 ϕ 2 h k ϕ γ θ k considering the supporting effect of breach channel flow on the side slope stability of the breach one third of the water depth is taken into account for the supporting effect as treated by fread 1988 therefore the cut down depth of the breach can be estimated by the equation 17 h k z up z h 3 where h k is the actual cut down depth of the breach m and z up is the top elevation of the dam m and z is the same as zi indicated in eq 13 it is assumed that erosion occurs equally along the bottom and sides of the breach except when the sides of the breach collapse consequently the breach bottom does not continue to erode downwards until the volume of collapsed material along the breach is completely removed the volume of the collapsed materials along the breach can be estimated as follows 18 δ v z up z 2 tan α i tan α i 1 l where δ v is the volume of collapsed materials m3 and α is the angle between the slope side and the vertical direction of the transverse breach channel if the slope of breach channel collapses the value of α will change with the change of θ k as shown in the eq 18 otherwise the α will keep unchanged 2 6 estimation module of the final bottom elevation the final bottom elevation of the breach which controls its vertical erosion as shown in eq 13 and fig 3 is an important input parameter for the most of available dam break models however this value which can only be obtained through a field investigation after the failure of landslide dam is directly put into the simulation by those models chen et al 2015 fread 1984 wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2017 for the convenience of prediction it should be estimated appropriately in advance according to the failure cases of landslide dams collected peng and zhang 2012 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 and the erosion category proposed by briaud et al 2008 regression analysis of the dam height and the breach depth with high medium and low erodibility was performed in this study empirical formulae to evaluate the final bottom elevation with different erodibility was developed subsequently the erosion category reflects the erodibility of the soil which is mainly related to factors such as the type compactness weight and particle size of the soil in general sandy soil has higher erodibility than clay soil with high compactness high weight and large particles has lower erodibility briaud et al 2008 proposed six erosion categories i e very high high medium low and very low erodibility as well as non erosive based on the erosion rate flow velocity or shear stress for the conveniences of estimation in this study erodibility is simply classified into three categories namely high medium and low based on the study conducted by briaud et al 2008 more than 1 200 worldwide failure cases of landslide dams zhang et al 2016 shi et al 2014 peng and zhang 2012 etc were collected to establish a database in which only 22 cases include detailed breaching information as shown in table 1 the preservation ratio of a landslide dam is the ratio of the residual dam height to the initial dam height based on the data in table 1 regression analysis of the dam heights and the breach depths with high medium and low erodibility was performed the quality of regression is indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 results of the regression analysis are as shown in fig 5 and table 2 it can be seen that the r2 values of the empirical equations for estimating the breach depth of landslide dams with high medium and low erodibility are 0 90 0 72 and 0 75 respectively these values indicate a relatively high goodness of fit in addition we can get that the higher the erodibility the smaller is the average preservation ratio which can further explain the applicability of the estimation module obtained in this study 2 7 calculation flow chart based on these six modules the landslide dam overtopping failure process can be simulated using the numerical iterative method the key breach related parameters including the discharge water level of the dammed lake breach bottom elevation breach width diversion channel length and etc can be obtained at each time step by the flow chart of numerical simulation as shown in fig 6 3 case study 3 1 study area at 22 06 october 10 and 17 40 on november 3 in 2018 baige village which lies on the right bank of the jinsha river at the border between sichuan province and tibet autonomous region of china experienced two successive landslides and river blocking events which took place at the same site and resulted in the formation of a large landslide lake detailed location of the event is shown in fig 7 detailed river blocking conditions formed on october 10 are indicated in fig 8 about 17 40 on november 3 2018 more than 3 7 million m3 of collapsed materials stacked over the previously formed landslide dam in the jinsha river channel creating an even larger barrier lake the second flooding due to the overtopping failure of the dam caused substantial damage to roads bridges farmland houses and water conservancyfacilities within the affected downstream areas of tibet sichuan and yunnan provinces cai et al 2020 according to the official report of the disaster reduction committee of yunnan province about 54 000 people were affected in diqing lijiang and dali counties 41 000 people were relocated more than 3 000 houses and 3 000 ha of farmland were damaged resulting in direct economic losses up to 7 4 billion yuan the flooding of the 11 03 baige landslide dam overtopping failure was very large and serous the peak discharge observed from the outlet of the breach reached to 31 000 m3 s in order to evaluate the accuracy of the model proposed in this study and also for the prediction purpose of similar events in the future the 11 03 baige landslide dam was selected as a case study 3 2 landslide dam condition after the formation of the 11 03 baige landslide dam the upstream water level rose rapidly according to an official report by the hydrological bureau of ganzi at 08 00 on november 8 the water level of the gangtuo hydrological station which is approximately 90 km upstream of the baige landslide dam was 3571 68 m with a discharge of 617 m3 s while at the barrier lake inflow rate was approximately 780 m3 s the storage capacity of the lake was approximately 321 million m3 with a corresponding water level of 2937 11 m and the water level increased with a rate of 0 22 m h according to the information collected without human intervention the water level of the dammed lake would rise to an elevation of 2966 m at 08 00 on november 15 to reduce the upstream inundation and the damage to the downstream regions at approximately 17 00 on november 8 excavation of the drainage channel was commenced at the left side of the previously breached landslide dam at 19 00 on november 11 the excavation was completed and the drainage channel had a length of 220 m in the streamwise direction the average depth bottom width and side slope of the excavated channel were 13 5 m 3 m and 1 1 3 respectively at 10 00 on november 12 the dammed lake began to discharge gradually based on the related document on the failure process of the 11 03 baige landslide dam and the data of field survey presented by cai et al 2020 the input parameters of this study were collected and given in table 3 it should be noted that the field measurement of breach final bottom elevation was 2905 8 m which is derived from zhong et al 2020b however the estimated value of 2903 8 m was listed in the table 3 because we want to check the applicability of the equation proposed for the estimation in this study the final bottom elevation was determined using the proposed empirical model and the calculated value was 2903 8 m the simulation process is as follows first based on the erodibility categories proposed by briaud et al 2008 the baige landslide dam belonged to the high erodibility category the empirical formula for a high erodibility landslide dam i e hb 0 2290hd 29 788 was used to calculate the breach depth of the baige landslide dam according to the calculation the breach depth was 48 7 m hence the final bottom elevation of the breach can be estimated by the difference of initial bottom elevation of 2952 5 m and the breach depth calculated namely 2952 5 48 7 2903 8 m which was used for the simulation and also listed in table 3 the absolute error in the estimation of the final bottom elevation of the breach was 2 m comparing with the field measurement of 2905 8 m and the relative error was 4 28 this predicted value adequately validates the accuracy of the proposed estimation module of the final bottom elevation in this study fig 9 presents the longitudinal profile of the 11 03 baige landslide dam zhang et al 2019 and fig 10 depicts the capacity water level curve of the 11 03 baige dammed lake cai et al 2019 furthermore fig 11 the grain size distributions of the 11 03 baige landslide dam 4 results and discussion according to the surveyed data in table 3 and taking 0 00o clock on november 13 of 2018 as the starting point of the numerical simulation the overtopping failure process of the 11 03 baige landslide dam was simulated using the proposed dam break model in this study simulated results are as shown in figs 12 14 which represent the variation processes of discharge water level of the barrier lake and breach width respectively in order to the accuracy of the proposed model the observed data based on the official documents are also given in these figures which are indicated by the dot points or description in the figures as for the breach width evolution in fig 14 it is assumed in the model that the width will not be changed when the breach shape is approximately reaching to the original river conditions because the breach final shape is mainly controlled by the original river morphology the material properties of baige landslide dam and the inflow and outflow conditions of the barrier lake in order to have a general impression about the accuracy of the dam break numerical model proposed in this study the main parameter comparisons regarding the breach and flow between the simulated and the measured data are summarized in table 4 it can be seen from the table that the simulated peak discharge is 30 508 m3 s while the measured is 31 000 m3 s and the relative error is only 1 59 the simulated time to the peak discharge is 38 min later than the measured and the relative error is only 3 5 the errors of the simulated flood volume breach bottom width and top width compared with the measured are totally less than 7 all of the main parameters of the breach and flow are quite satisfactory on the basis of table 4 and fig 12 then how about the flow process of breach outlet further comparison is conducted and the results are given in table 5 based on the flood hydrograph simulated it can be seen from the table 5 that the simulated flow process from the breach outlet is also in good agreement with the measured process and the averaged flow error is 18 2 which is within the requirements of related regulation or code for hydrological forecast in china among them the relative error of the discharge simulated at the point of the first rising stage namely at 15 00of november 13 is big up to 50 3 there are several reasons which can lead to the large error at this point firstly some errors may be existed in the storage capacity curve and the estimation formula of discharge adopted in the model secondly the model takes 0 00o clock on november 13 as the starting point of simulation and the initial water level and other input parameters estimated at that time are not accurate because there is no hydrological station and an accurate data observed is not available when the model calculated at 15 00on november 13 the undercutting rate of the breach maybe large and lead the large difference of the discharge however only the peak discharge and the time to the peak are generally regarded as the most important for the flood damage controlling of downstream regions while the discharge at the initial rising stage in a large river like jinsha river is not so important because the simulated discharge of 7 813 m3 s is a little bit bigger than the annual averaged discharge if this point is not taken into account the averaged error of flood hydrograph simulated will be lowered to 14 6 regarding to the change of water level and the breach development we can find that the simulated processes of water level and the breach are also in good agreement with the measured data as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 therefore the dam break numerical model proposed can well reproduce the whole overtopping failure process of baige landslide dam which has further verified the accuracy and rationality of the model developed in this study 4 1 comparison with model without considering headward erosion several experimental studies have shown that headward erosion is an obvious phenomenon during the overtopping failure of landslide dams it cannot be ignored to build up a numerical model therefore we considered it in our model in order to evaluate its impact on dam breaching the 11 03 baige landslide dam was selected as a case study results obtained by the proposed model were compared with those without considering headward erosion figs 15 and 16 present the calculated longitudinal profiles with and without headward erosion respectively it can be seen that during the dam break failure process the downstream slope of the dam gradually decreases and the length of breach channel gradually changes based on the model with headward erosion the results can reveal properly the experimental results by jiang et al 2016 however the downstream slope of the dam will not change and the length of breach channel will gradually increase based on the model without considering headward erosion in order to further explain the necessity of considering headward erosion for the simulation on overtopping failure of the natural dams comparison has also been conducted for the breaching parameters and flood hydrograph by the models with and without headward erosion details of the comparison are shown in fig 17 and table 6 as shown in table 6 the relative errors of the peak discharge time to the peak total flood volume and the final top and bottom widths of the breach simulated by the model proposed in this study are less than those resulted from the model without considering headward erosion fig 17 a compares the horizontal length variation of diversion channel simulated by the two models based on the model developed in this study to consider headward erosion the length will gradually increase and finally reach to a stable length of 322 m at 19 01 on november 13 2018 this is because the breach final bottom elevation is estimated in advance and the headward erosion and vertical erosion will be stopped during the simulation process this is reasonable because it takes place after the time to the peck which is at18 38o clock on november 13 based on table 5 however in the model without consider headward erosion the length will continuously increase until the end of simulation and finally reach to 605 m at 0 00o clock on november 15 2018 this is not reasonable because there always has a residual section of landslide dam which corresponds to the breach final bottom elevation when an overtopping failure had taken place as for the flood process of breach and water level variation of the barrier lake simulated results by the two models are indicated in fig 17 b and c respectively as shown in fig 17 b and c the peak discharge will be quite smaller time to the peak will be delayed flood hydrograph will be widened change rate of the water level in the lake will be smaller and water level will maintain a higher water level when the model without considering headward erosion is used to simulate the failure process however when the proposed model to consider the headward erosion is used the calculated flood hydrograph and water level of the barrier lake agree well with the measured data as displayed in figs 12 and 13 and table 5 the reason for the differences is that when headward erosion is not considered the horizontal length of channel simulated will gradually and continuously increase during the erosion process and exceed the actual length of channel resulting in a decrease in the rates of lateral enlargement and vertical erosion therefore the calculated breach bottom elevation will be higher and the breach bottom width will be smaller as shown in fig 17 d and e respectively due to the slower rate of vertical erosion and the smaller width the discharging capacity of the channel will be decreased the water level of the dammed lake will be lowered slowly and maintain a higher water level as shown in fig 17 c the water head will be smaller as shown in fig 17 f due to the breach bottom elevation is higher based on the analysis headward erosion is very important for the prediction of landslide dam overtopping failure furthermore the proposed numerical model in this study can be applied to accurately predict the entire failure process 4 2 sensitivity analysis regarding the numerical study on the overtopping failure of landslide dams it is a prerequisite to generalize in advance the shape of a landslide dam which include the upstream and downstream slopes of dams if headward erosion has to be taken into account this generalization may lead to an influence on the simulated results in the development of breach and flood hydrograph in this study we proposed a numerical model to deal with headward erosion process and a satisfactory result have been achieved to further elucidate the applicability of the proposed model and the influence of the generalization sensitivity analyses were conducted on the generalization of upstream and downstream slopes for the conciseness we only give the simulated results of flood related parameters namely the peak discharge and the time to the peak in the sensitive analysis in addition as it may well know that the excavation of diversion channel is an effective measure to reduce flooding damages in the downstream region due to overtopping failure how effective will it be therefore in our case study of 11 03 baige overtopping failure event both with and without the diversion channel were also investigated 4 2 1 impact of upstream slope the upstream slope of the dam was changed from original 20 to 18 19 21 and 22 to investigate its effects while other parameters were remained unchanged the dam overtopping failure process was simulated by the model proposed in this study table 7 shows the corresponding changes in the peak discharge and time to the peak due to the slope angle variation based on the available documents of the landslide dam it is assumed that the upstream slope 20 of the dam is appropriate the peak discharges simulated with different angles don t change greatly as shown in table 7 the biggest difference is the case with an upstream slope angle of 18 and the relative error is 6 86 compared with the observed discharge of 31 000 m3 s and the time to the peak will be delayed generally for all cases however the delay will be shortened gradually with the increase of upstream slope angles the maximum delayed are also the case with an upstream slope angle of 18 which has a time delay of 0 73 h in general the simulated results indicate that as the upstream slope increases the predicted peak discharge will be increased slightly and the time to the peak will be delayed for all cases but the delay will be less with the increases of upstream slope angles fig 18 presents a comparison of flood hydrographs for different upstream slopes the results indicate that the flow hydrograph will be taller and thinner as the upstream slope increases in addition the time to the peak will be delayed generally speaking results of this sensitive analysis demonstrate that the peak discharge and time to the peak are less sensitive to the change of upstream slope angles 4 2 2 impact of downstream slope to investigate the effect of the downstream slope the slope was varied from original 10 to 8 9 11 and 12 while other parameters were remained unchanged the overtopping failure process was simulated again using the proposed model table 8 gives the corresponding changes in the peak discharge and time to the peak which are the most important two characteristic parameters of flood hydrograph the results in the table 8 indicate that as the downstream slope increases the predicted peak discharge will be increased rapidly for instance when the angle varied from 10 to 12 the peak discharge changed will be increased from 30 508 m3 s to 37 437 m3 s with an increment of 6 929 m3 s the relative error can reach to 20 76 when compared with the measured 31 000 m3 s as for the predicted time to the peak all of the cases are also delayed but the delay will be reduced quickly with the increase of downstream slope fig 19 presents a comparison of flood hydrographs for different downstream slopes the results show that as the predefined downstream slope increases the predicted flood hydrograph will be taller and thinner which are the same as the changing situation of upstream slope angles this trend may be explained by the fact that if the downstream slope is steeper the velocity of dam break flow will be faster and lead to a rapid undercutting of the downstream slope these results demonstrate that the peak discharge and time to the peak are quite sensitive to the downstream slope especially the peak discharge in addition they are more sensitive to the downstream slope than to the upstream slope which indicates that giving a reasonable and accurate downstream slope is significant for overtopping failure simulation of landslide dams by the model proposed in this study in order to further investigate the influence of initial downstream slope angle on the overtopping failure process the simulated change rate of downstream slope angle and the change rate of channel length under different initial downstream slope angles are analysed results are as shown in figs 20 and 21 respectively it can be seen from fig 20 that the larger the initial downstream slope angle is the greater the change rate of downstream slope angle is the change rate of breach channel length is the change amount of channel length per time step it is worth noting that when the channel length at a given time step is smaller than that at the previous time step the change rate of channel length at that time step is positive otherwise it is negative it can be seen from fig 21 that when the initial downstream slope is 12 11 10 the change rate of channel length is always positive indicating that the channel length is gradually decreasing in the breaking process at the same time the larger the initial downstream slope angle is the greater the change rate of channel length is at each time step namely the greater the rate of headward erosion is however at the initial downstream slope of 9 and 8 it can be seen that the change rate of the channel length is always negative indicating that the channel length is gradually increasing in general the larger the initial downstream slope angle is the greater the change rate of downstream slope angle is in the process of dam break and the stronger the erosion rate is which leads to the greater change rate of channel length and the greater the flood discharge therefore the change of downstream slope is dominant rather than the change of channel length when the initial downstream slope angle is predefined 4 2 3 impact of diversion channel excavation excavation of diversion channels is a common and effective measure to reduce the downstream flood damages due to the overtopping failure of landslide dams how effective will it be to evaluate its effects the model proposed in this study also used for this purpose the initial elevation of the breach bottom was assigned to the value of 2966 m which was the top elevation of the 11 03 baige landslide dam the estimated starting time of natural overtopping failure would be approximately at 08 00 on november 15th according to the inflow situation of the barrier lake other parameters for the simulation were remained unchanged simulated results of the main breach characteristic parameters with and without the diversion channel are as shown in table 9 while the flood hydrographs are indicated in fig 22 as shown in table 9 without a diversion channel simulated time to the peak would occur at 01 26 on november 16th the peak discharge would be raised up approximately to 46 668 m3 s and the total flood volume would be about 762 million m3 if comparing it with that of diversion channel the time to peak would be delayed by approximately 55 h the peak discharge would be 1 5 times larger the total flood volume would be nearly 1 4 times larger and the final breach width would also be larger as shown in table 9 these trends occur because excavation of diversion channel can discharge or empty the barrier lake as earlier as possible so that the scale of flooding due to overtopping failure of landslide dams can be artificially reduced in advance therefore the excavation of diversion channel can play a significant role to mitigate flood damage substantially when condition permits a diversion channel should be excavated as earlier as possible once a gigantic landslide dam takes place in a larger river 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a dam break numerical model to deal with the headward erosion which is obvious and has a significant influence on the breaching and flood hydrograph of landslide dam overtopping failure but it is seldom considered in current available dam break models the proposed model consists of six modules hydrodynamic module sediment transport module breach evolution module headward erosion module stability analysis module of side slope and estimation module of the final bottom elevation a case study of the 11 03 baige landslide dam with a large barrier lake was conducted the results obtained by the model proposed were compared with the measured data and those of the model without headward erosion relative errors between the predicted and the measured flood and breach parameters such as peak discharge time to the peak total flood volume final breach width and etc are all within 7 which demonstrates that the rationality and accuracy of the model proposed in this study are satisfactory in addition an empirical model for estimating the final bottom elevation of high medium and low erodibility landslide dams was developed this model can solve the problem of using the measured value of breach final bottom elevation directly into the dam break numerical simulation for most existing models to predict newly formed landslide dam failure process in the case study of the 11 03 baige landslide dam the relative error of the breach final bottom elevation estimated is 4 2 compared with the field observation that is to say the rationality of the proposed empirical formula is acceptable furthermore a sensitivity analysis was conducted for parameters such as the upstream and downstream slopes during the shape generalization of landslide dam additionally the effectiveness of diversion channel excavation has also been investigated results of the sensitive analysis demonstrate that the breach and flood parameters are more sensitive to the downstream slope than to the upstream slope in which the downstream slope has a greater impact on the flood hydrograph excavation of a diversion channel can reduce substantially the peak discharge of the flood hydrograph because it can discharge the barrier lake as earlier as possible therefore diversion channel excavation is an effective measure to mitigate the flood tragedy of landslide dam failure in summary the dam break numerical model proposed in this study can reasonably predict the overtopping failure of landslide dams however as the mechanism of headward erosion is not understand completely uncertainties still remain further studies and applications are desired for the improvement of the proposed model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4326,the accurate estimation of stream water temperature is essential for understanding environmental controls on the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems few studies have coupled soil and stream water temperatures to capture the synergy of thermal balances between terrestrial and riverine systems as a result little is known about how multiple environmental stresses have affected water temperature particularly for different orders of streams here we incorporated a new water transport scheme into the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem to predict water temperature in 1st order and higher order streams 1st order driven by a 4 km geo referenced dataset of multiple environmental factors our new water temperature model was utilized to predict the spatiotemporal variations of water temperature in the u s mid atlantic region during 1900 2015 results revealed that water temperature during 1970 2015 increased significantly p 0 05 and the rate of increase of the 1st order streams 0 32 c decade 1 is higher than that of higher order streams 0 28 c decade 1 the buffering effect of groundwater on water temperature in 1st order streams diminished under the context of climate warming factorial analysis showed that climate change and variability explain most of the changes 80 in stream water temperature since 1900 land use conversions mostly from cropland to forest co2 fertilization and land nitrogen management collectively explained a greater percent of change in water temperature in 1st order streams 24 than higher order streams 9 implying that 1st order streams are particularly vulnerable to human activities keywords dynamic land ecosystem model dlem global change mid atlantic region stream order water temperature 1 introduction stream water temperature is a fundamental physical variable reflecting the balance of thermal energy in aquatic systems chapra 2008 it has been well documented that stream water temperature can substantially affect the solubility of oxygen and other gases sander 2015 govern the decomposition or mineralization rate of organic matter pastor et al 2003 and regulate the fate of nitrogen harrison et al 2009 and phosphorus mcqueen and lean 1987 water temperature also moderates the metabolic rate of microorganisms claireaux et al 2000 and can shape the spatial distribution of habitats supporting aquatic species isaak et al 2010 given its importance to aquatic biogeochemistry and biodiversity significant efforts have been devoted to monitoring and estimation of water temperature van vliet et al 2013 although ubiquitous water discharge monitoring sites have been established worldwide water temperature observations are still lacking wanders et al 2019 a modeling approach is needed to construct the spatial and temporal patterns of stream water temperature across large regions empirical relationships derived from the regression analysis of observed water temperature and air temperature are commonly deployed in water quality models due to their relative simplicity leach and moore 2019 such relationships can provide reliable estimates of water temperature for regional studies because the regression parameters can be calibrated to match the data as a result the performance of an empirically based model strongly depends on the amount and quality of data from the study region if the environmental conditions change the skill of these models in predicting water temperature may drop arismendi et al 2014 the reason for this is that empirical relationships cannot represent the mechanisms of how environmental factors contribute to changes in stream water temperature this inherent weakness has hampered their application in long term studies where land use and land management change over time stream water temperature is highly sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances for instance water temperature has been increasing in streams draining to the chesapeake bay usa which aligns with the increase in air temperature in the region rice and jastram 2015 land management such as forest clear cutting can also significantly impact water temperature chen et al 2016 brown and krygier 1970 management of water resources such as dam construction or reservoir operations can cool or warm water temperature under different environmental conditions due to the changes in water surface area and the thermal energy leaking from the bottom of the reservoirs chen fang 2015b in recent years an improved understanding of the energy balance in streams has been obtained through field studies which has subsequently promoted the development of physically based approaches that incorporate climate and hydraulic variables into the energy balance equations these models have found applications at the basin level wu et al 2012 regional level buccola et al 2016 isaak et al 2017 continental level li et al 2015b and global level van vliet et al 2013 wanders et al 2019 physically based models can capture the changes in environmental conditions and provide reliable results for historical data reconstruction wanders et al 2019 and future projections ficklin et al 2014 wu et al 2012 however physically based models still need certain assumptions to simplify the processes that are not understood well or are too complex therefore empirical equations are commonly incorporated into physically based models to estimate water temperature of 1st order streams often as a boundary condition haag and luce 2008 van vliet et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge few studies presented the spatial distribution of stream temperature in headwaters over a large region the headwater zone known as the terrestrial aquatic interface has been recognized as a hotspot for greenhouse gas ghg emissions butman and raymond 2011 and has therefore prompted significant interest from both field research and modeling communities for example a recent study has suggested that headwater streams can be important refuges for cold water species under the risk of changing climate isaak et al 2016 although this study suggested that headwater zones can buffer the impact of climate small headwater streams have cooler water temperature in summer and warmer water temperature in winter than higher order streams they are particularly vulnerable to climate change and human activities especially when environmental change reaches a tipping point nepstad et al 2008 over the past century headwater zones have been heavily impacted by human and or natural disturbances isaak et al 2010 cover et al 2010 for example some studies have found 5 c increase in water temperature of headwater streams after fire disturbances suggesting a strong synergy between land surface processes and water temperature isaak et al 2010 koontz et al 2018 in this study we coupled a new water transport scheme called model for scale adaptive river transport mosart li et al 2013 li et al 2015b with our land ecosystem model dynamic land ecosystem model dlem tian et al 2015 we incorporated a physically based water temperature model into dlem we linked a simplified groundwater process to the stream water as a boundary condition and improved the model representation of the groundwater fed sub grid routing thermal energy exchanges within the 1st order streams the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of water temperature of head water streams and higher order 1st order streams from 1900 to 2015 across the mid atlantic region including the chesapeake bay and delaware bay watersheds and 2 isolate the contribution of environmental factors to stream water temperature across this region 2 methods 2 1 the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem the terrestrial processes were simulated by the dynamic land ecosystem model 2 0 dlem 2 0 fig 1 a which couples the major terrestrial water cycle liu et al 2013 pan et al 2015 with carbon nitrogen coupled vegetation dynamics tian et al 2012 chen et al 2013 to explicitly estimate plant growth soil biogeochemistry the associated water fluxes and greenhouse gas emissions in terrestrial ecosystems driven by the climate forcing and the anthropogenic disturbances the model has been successfully applied at relatively coarse resolutions such as 0 5 degrees global level or five arc minutes regional level tian et al 2015 in order to extend its range to higher resolutions sub grid processes were introduced into the terrestrial simulations by adapting a cohort unit the land use cohort divides each grid cell into five types of normalized vegetation coverage including the fraction of cropland four primary natural vegetation covers and six non vegetation types including urban impervious surface glacier lake stream ocean water and bare ground dlem has been previously improved to represent the riverine transport and thus is well suited for quantifying the lateral or vertical fluxes of water carbon tian et al 2015 and nitrogen yao et al 2020 from land to the oceans fig 1a a scale adaptive water transport scheme mosart model li et al 2013 was incorporated into the dlem aquatic module yao et al 2020 the new scheme separates the water transport process within a grid unit into hillslope routing subnetwork routing and main channel routing fig 1b hillslope routing is the water routing process that aggregates surface runoff and sends it to subnetworks groundwater pool receives water from subsurface runoff shallow groundwater flow and contributes to subnetworks with outflow rates derived from a fixed residence time which is empirically set to 2 days liu et al 2013 the subnetwork routing represents the hydrologic processes involving 1st order streams that receive water from overland flow and groundwater pool and then discharge to the main channel both hillslope and subnetwork routings are sub grid routing processes within a grid cell the main channel routing represents the routing process of higher order streams 2nd and higher order streams in a 4 km resolution grid cell for this study receiving flow from subnetworks and upstream grid cells and flowing to a downstream grid cell the dlem model uses the kinematic wave method for flow routing in channels chow 1964 which requires several hydrography variables e g flow direction channel length and channel slope and geomorphological parameters e g channel width and channel depth all this information was derived from the hydro1k and nhdplus hydrography datasets li et al 2015a yao et al 2021 in the water temperature module of dlem we simulated the thermal energy dynamics of 1st order subnetworks in the water transport scheme and higher order streams main channel flow in the water transport scheme separately thus we need to estimate the water surface area of both types of streams we obtained the surface area data from remote sensing products for the higher order streams and quantified the water surface area as of 1st order streams at which scale remotely sensed products are not available or reliable through an empirical relationship proposed by allen et al 2018 1 a s a rs w a t e r r e m o t e l y s e n s e d d a

community land model bonan et al 2013 the soil column in dlem was divided into 10 layers and the thickness of each layer was defined as 0 05 m 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 2 m 0 3 m 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 8 m and 1 0 m respectively we did not explicitly quantify the temperature of the vegetation canopy and the heat fluxes between the canopy and the soil surface thus we quantify the surface soil temperature by using a semi empirical method as the upper boundary condition of the soil layers which considers the effect of leaf area index lai and litter on soil temperature kang et al 2000 4 t j t j 1 a t j 1 e

surface to a given depth d w g note that as a simplification all the water and heat fluxes from the hillslopes and groundwater pool contribute directly to the first order streams in the model i e higher order streams do not receive water or heat flux from hillslopes this has a minimal effect on results because the total drainage area of hillslopes directly contributing to higher order streams

the model described above was applied to the chesapeake bay watershed and delaware river basin fig 3 both of which are located within the mid atlantic region of the northeast u s this is the most urbanized region of the country and sustains more than 25 5 million people the region covers more than 166 103 square kilometers of land surface and has experienced substantial land conversion due to reforestation over the past century hassett et al 2005 in this study we developed a 4 km resolution dataset of this region as model input to run the dlem model with climate land conversion and land management driving forces from 1900 to 2015 a potential vegetation map was reconstructed for the mid atlantic region by combining land use data obtained from the national land cover database nlcd jin et al 2013 https www mrlc gov the north american land change monitoring system www cec org naatlas and the global c4 vegetation map still et al 2003 we used the county level inventory data of cropland area and urban area to prescribe the land use change of natural vegetation waisanen and bliss 2002 a flowchart describing the generation of the historical land use land cover is shown in supplementary fig 2 as shown in fig 4 cropland area decreased by 57 3 fig 4d during the past 100 years this is primarily due to the 9 1 increase in forest area and the 507 5 increase in urban areas most of the urban expansion occurred surrounding the megacities including washington dc baltimore and philadelphia fig 4c we obtained historical climate variables from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism climate dataset available at http www prism oregonstate edu including daily minimum mean and maximum temperature as well as precipitation at 4 km spatial resolution the mean annual precipitation was 1080 0 131 7 mm yr 1 and the annual mean temperature was 11 6 0 2 c during 1900 2015 respectively both precipitation and air temperature show significant increasing trends p 0 05 in mann kendall test from 1960 to 2015 with the rates of 3 3 mm yr 1 and 0 017 c decade 1 respectively the dlem nitrogen inputs include atmospheric nitrogen deposition nitrogen fertilizer use and manure nitrogen production we combined global nitrogen deposition and chesapeake bay program s data to reconstruct a long term product pan et al 2021 crop specific nitrogen fertilizer use from 1961 to 2008 was obtained from the national agricultural statistics service https quickstats nass usda gov manure nitrogen production data was derived from the usda county level livestock population data yang et al 2016 3 2 simulation experiments before running the simulations for the period 1900 2015 at a daily time step we first set up an equilibrium run for all the grid units the simulation was forced by the land use data of the year 1900 and the 30 year mean 1900 1929 climate data to represent the pre industrial environmental conditions other driving forces including atmospheric co2 concentration land use change and nitrogen inputs were kept at the pre industrial levels 1900 to exclude human disturbance the equilibrium run was terminated when carbon nitrogen and water pools reached a steady state thornton and rosenbloom 2005 after the equilibrium run was completed we conducted a 30 year spin up run with randomly selected climate variables from 1900 to 1929 the spin up run functions as a buffer to smooth the carbon and nitrogen fluxes between the equilibrium run and the year to year transient run tian et al 2012 finally we conducted a transient run for which all the driving forces change over time from year 1900 to 2015 we defined three free parameters including the ones associated with the water surface area cef in eq 5 and groundwater inputs kt in eq 4 and d w g for ground water temperature in equation 6 we first calibrated kt set as 0 5 and d w g set as 0 5 m to match the simulated water temperature of headwater streams to observed water temperature we then calibrated cef ranges from 0 7 0 9 of different stream orders to match with the associated observations supplementary table 1 the simulation with all the driving forces changing over time is recognized as the reference simulation s 1 in table 1 we conducted a factorial analysis to assess the contribution of environmental factors to the changes in water temperature we set up five simulations with each of the environmental factors held constant at year 1900 level s 2 7 in table 1 and the contribution of each environmental factor was calculated by comparing the simulated water temperature of each run with the reference simulation here climate effect refers to the joint effect of precipitation temperature relative humidity shortwave radiation and longwave radiation varying over time we also examined the effects induced by precipitation and air temperature alone by comparing s 6 and 7 to s 1 for consistency and ease of comparison all simulations used identical model parameter values i e those calibrated for s 1 4 results 4 1 model performance to assess the performance of the stream water temperature model we compared our model simulation results against the daily water temperature measurements at various sites collected by the united states geological survey usgs u s geological survey 2001 the sites are well distributed in the sub basins across the region fig 3 table 2 we calculated root mean square deviation rmsd nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r 2 to assess the performance of the dlem water temperature model in predicting the daily average water temperature table 2 supplementary fig 3 overall the modeled water temperatures agree well with the observations the average r 2 nse and rmsd values are 0 87 0 7 and 3 4 c respectively table 2 4 2 spatial and temporal patterns of water temperature to assess the spatial variation of stream water temperature we looked at the annual mean water temperatures averaged for the 2006 2015 period annual average water temperatures generally vary with latitude with most of the streams in the south having higher annual mean water temperatures 16 c 20 c than those in the north 8 c 14 c fig 5 topography also plays a role in shaping the spatial pattern of water temperature as can be seen in fig 5 the streams in the appalachian mountain region have consistently lower temperatures 4 c 12 c than the streams in the coastal plain 12 c 20 c both for 1st order streams and higher order streams fig 5 we analyzed the spatial and temporal pattern of water temperature within the higher order streams higher than 1st stream order fig 5a and 1st order streams fig 5b separately across the study region in general the annual mean water temperatures in the 1st order streams are slightly cooler than the annual mean water temperatures of the higher order streams about 68 of the higher order streams had annual mean water temperature above 12 c on the contrary around 57 of the first order streams had annual mean water temperature below 12 c in the megacities fig 3 fig 4c such as washington dc baltimore and philadelphia the annual mean water temperature reached 18 c 20 c in 1st order streams fig 5b but stream water temperature dropped quickly to 12 c 14 c at higher order streams fig 5a in the southeastern part of the study region the annual mean water temperature of 1st order streams is mostly around 12 c 14 c with the water temperature of the higher order streams reaching 16 c 20 c 4 3 long term changes in stream water temperature mean annual water temperature of 1st and higher order streams were calculated by taking arithmetic averages of each stream segment note that each cell contains a 1st order stream and a higher order stream the mean annual water temperature in higher order streams increased significantly p 0 05 in mann kendall test from 1900 to 2015 at a rate of 0 047 c decade 1 the warming rate was much higher in recent years 1970 2015 at 0 28 c decade 1 fig 6 c the water temperature in 1st order streams also increased significantly p 0 05 in mann kendall test during 1900 2015 with a rate of 0 065 c decade 1 and the rate reached 0 32 c decade 1 from 1970 to 2015 fig 6c we conducted student s t test to compare the average stream temperature of 1st order and higher order streams for the period 1900 2015 and found a significant difference p 0 01 fig 6c we also estimated flow weighted average water temperature of 1st order and higher order streams supplementary fig 4 we found that the increasing trend of water temperature within 1st order streams using the flow weighted average method 0 31 c decade 1 is comparable to that of the arithmetic average method 0 32 c decade 1 however the increasing trend in temperature in higher order streams based on the flow weighted average 0 22 c decade 1 is much lower than the one based on the arithmetic average 0 28 c decade 1 for the remainder of the paper average temperature refers to the arithmetic average to check whether these increases are statistically significant we applied the mann kendall trend test and theil sen linear regression to the 116 years of water temperature data at each grid cell fig 6a b about 52 of all the stream segments showed warming trend from 1900 to 2015 p 0 05 regardless of whether they were first or higher order streams fig 6d the increasing trend of water temperatures in 5th or 6th order streams figs 3 6a is not statistically significant p 0 05 and the associated trend is less than 0 02 c decade 1 from 1900 to 2015 in the inland portions of the study region stream water temperatures remained relatively stable with most of the grid cells having statistically insignificant trends p 0 05 over the past 116 years fig 6c however many 1st order streams showed a century long increasing trend only a few points had a statistically significant p 0 05 in mann kendall test decreasing trend of water temperature in both higher order streams and 1st order streams the stream water temperature of the northern regions had very small increasing or decreasing trends mostly p 0 05 with the rate ranging from 0 001 c decade 1 to 0 02c decade 1 surprisingly many of the streams in the southern portion of the study region where the annual average stream temperature is highest fig 6 have a slightly decreasing water temperature around 0 05 c decade 1 4 4 attributing the contribution of environmental factors to changes in stream water temperature the factorial analysis showed that climate factors i e temperature and precipitation explain about 80 of the changes in stream water temperatures across the mid atlantic from 1900 to 2015 figs 7 and 8 in the 1970s the climate impact on water temperature in higher order streams and 1st order streams diminished to 30 and 4 4 respectively figs 7 and 8 primarily due to the similarity of the climate between the 1900s and 1970s the decadal mean air temperature of the 1900s 10 44 c was very close to that of the 1970s 10 53 c fig 4 land use conversion accounts for 37 and 61 of the changes in water temperature in higher order streams and 1st order streams respectively during the 1970s figs 7 and 8 nitrogen inputs and increases in atmospheric co2 contribute more than 30 of the increase in water temperature in higher order streams and 1st order streams in the 1970s after the 1970s the contribution of land use co2 and n inputs to the changes in water temperature of higher order streams dropped to 10 but they still account for 20 of the changes in 1st order stream water temperature fig 7 4 5 sensitivity of stream water temperature in response to the groundwater input our model assumes that the temperature of the seepage from groundwater is equal to the mean soil temperature of a defined depth dw g 0 5 m to examine the sensitivity of groundwater input parameter on modeled stream water temperature we run the model dw g given as 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 m respectively we then plotted the simulated daily water temperature at two usgs sites of the delaware river 01428750 3rd order and 01460300 5th order fig 9 from 2000 to 2001 this sensitivity analysis suggests that water temperature continuously drops with increased dw g and a noticeable time lag was detected at both sites when dw g changed from 0 1 m to 2 m especially for the delaware river sites located at higher order streams we compared the model performances for different d w g values the performances were similar for d w g 0 1 m and 0 5 m r2 0 77 nse 0 71 rmsd 3 9 for 0 1 m r2 0 76 nse 0 7 rmsd 4 0 for 0 5 m the model performance decreased significantly once d w g became larger than 0 5 m r2 0 7 nse 0 64 rmsd 4 4 for d w g 1m r2 0 58 nse 0 53 rmsd 5 0 for d w g 2m 5 discussion 5 1 the impact of climate on the stream water temperature air temperature is the dominant driver of the increase and variability in stream water temperature the spatial pattern of the warming trend of water temperature fig 6d follows that of air temperature fig 4f with both water and air temperatures increasing in coastal regions and decreasing in the mountain regions air temperature primarily influences water temperature in two pathways 1 thermal energy is exchanged between the air and water interface arismendi et al 2014 and 2 rising air temperature influences land surface temperature and indirectly impacts the temperature of shallow groundwater and the adjacent 1st order streams kurylyk et al 2015 menberg et al 2014 using data from 129 usgs sites rice and jastram 2015 found that since the 1970s stream water temperatures and air temperature across the chesapeake bay watershed are increasing at statistically significant p 0 05 in mann kendall test rates at 0 28 c decade 1 and 0 23 c decade 1 respectively since most of the observation sites in rice and jastram s 2015 study were located in higher order streams the magnitude of the increasing trend in their study is consistent with the dlem estimated rate of increase 0 28 c decade 1 of water temperature in higher order streams from 1970 to 2015 across the whole mid atlantic region however dlem based results suggest a higher rate of increase of water temperature 0 32 c decade 1 in 1st order streams overall the contribution of air temperature to the changes in water temperature in higher order streams is consistent with that of 1st order streams in our factorial analysis fig 8a thus the higher rate of increase of water temperature in 1st order streams must come from other environmental factors precipitation is another dominant climate variable that significantly influences stream water temperature a higher precipitation rate would enlarge the water surface area in the headwater zone which accelerates the thermal energy exchange between air and water equation 5 on the other hand the increase in precipitation results in cooling of groundwater discharge in summer and warming in winter briggs et al 2018 which substantially buffers the seasonal variations of water temperature in both 1st order and higher order streams burns et al 2017 snyder et al 2015 additionally increased precipitation cools the land surface even though evaporative energy release also contributes to the changes in water temperature trenberth and shea 2005 our factorial experiments suggest that the contribution of precipitation to 1st order stream temperature is more significant than that for higher order streams fig 8b we only considered the contribution of the absolute value of air temperature and precipitation because of the variations in climate conditions that do not account for the long term changes that is because the increased precipitation substantially increased groundwater discharge the 1st order streams which have considerable groundwater and surface water exchanges show less seasonal variation than the main river channels thus 1st order streams are conventionally thought of as a refugia for species in relation to climate change due to the cooling effect of groundwater discharge during the summer season ficklin et al 2014 isaak et al 2016 snyder et al 2015 a recent study found that the thermal energy of water seepage from shallow groundwater increased significantly with the rising land surface temperature in the blue ridge mountains of the u s briggs et al 2018 the refugia of cold water species would disappear soon due to global warming leach and moore 2019 similarly we found a faster rate of increase of temperature in groundwater fed 1st order streams across the mid atlantic region fig 6c leach and moore 2019 also reached a similar conclusion at the catchment level using a process based study 5 2 land conversion effects on water temperature land use change shows a tremendous impact on water temperature in higher order streams and 1st order streams as predicted by dlem water temperature in urban streams reached 18 c 20 c in 2015 which is higher than the water temperature of the sub urban regions fig 5b simulation results suggest that water temperature in 1st order streams is susceptible to urbanization however the effect of land use change on water temperatures quickly dampened while water flows into 2nd or higher order streams fig 5a because the contribution of advective heat fluxes on water temperature was significantly enhanced due to the increased water surface area the study region experienced a significant re forestation from cropland and de forestation due to urbanization during the last century fig 4a which contributed to the substantial changes in water temperature that is because we considered the effects of plant lai on soil surface temperature equation 5 which could have cascading effects on the water temperature in 1st order streams and higher order streams forests have higher lai than that of cropland and urban impervious surface and this shading effect of forest canopy results in cooler waters in the mountain region fig 5 on the other hand the changes in vegetation types resulted in different ground litter depth and surface albedo which are directly linked to the soil evaporative energy release we found that water temperature in areas dominated by forests or grassland is much lower than in urban areas due to the higher evapotranspiration rates which has been implicitly represented in dlem fig 5 additionally we found a significant warmer water temperature in 1st order streams adjacent to the megacities fig 6 a b these stream temperature surges directly link to the loss of biomass cover and a warmer air temperature urban heat island due to rapid urbanization which is also supported by the catchment scale modeling and field observation studies leblanc et al 1997 nelson et al 2009 nelson and palmer 2007 5 3 effect of groundwater on water temperature earth system models and hydrological models do not explicitly simulate the lateral transport of groundwater from the soil root zone to the tributary streams thus simplification is needed in the definition of the 1st order stream temperatures or seepage groundwater temperature most of the previous modeling studies used empirical models to represent the water temperature of the headwater zone the empirically based headwater temperature estimates were used as boundary conditions to force the water temperature models brown 1969 van vliet et al 2013 van vliet et al 2012 van wijk and de vries 1963 wanders et al 2019 wu et al 2012 thus the sensitivity of water temperature in response to the boundary condition has not been thoroughly investigated especially for the large rivers 4th and higher climatic and hydraulics variables including surface area air temperature and radiation were conventionally considered as the dominant drivers li et al 2015b wu et al 2012 therefore proper representation of the temperature of the seepage from groundwater is of great importance during the coupling of the land model with riverine transport li et al 2015a suggested that the boundary condition of the groundwater seepage temperature is from the water table to the bottom of the root zone 5 m depth in the community land model oleson et al 2010 which is much deeper than that in this study coupling of surface and ground water processes will be needed in the future for improved water temperature estimates in streams as the depth of the water table may be very different in different topographies and climates 5 4 comparison to other models the dlem water temperature module has a comparable performance to other representative models conducted at different scales ficklin et al 2012 van vliet et al 2012 wu et al 2012 yearsley 2012 the average nse of the previous studies varies from 0 50 to 0 70 which is slightly lower than the values in this study the ranges of r2 and rmsd in previous studies are about 0 8 0 9 and 2 0 4 0 respectively which are in agreement with our results however improving the prediction of stream water temperature was not the primary goal of this study this is the first study to our knowledge that fully coupled a terrestrial ecosystem model with a physically based water temperature model empirically based models which commonly use air temperature as the sole variable to predict the water temperature can achieve a better accuracy over process based models because their simple structures allow adequate parameterization brown 1969 chen and fang 2015b mohseni et al 1998 segura et al 2014 wehrly et al 2009 however there is a growing debate on if air temperature could be used as the sole indicator of water temperature arismendi et al 2014 the reliability of empirical equations would be substantially hampered by the changes in hydrological conditions or land use cover arismendi et al 2014 our study showed that the rate of increase of water temperature in 1st order streams is higher than that of air temperature fig 6 c which cannot be captured by empirical models this and other findings imply that empirical equations may not be reliable for long term predictions due to the lack of mechanistic representation which is also supported by a catchment level study within the columbia river basin leach and moore 2019 5 5 uncertainties and future work although this model is process based we still used several semi empirical equations to represent the physical processes for instance we conducted a semi empirical based method to estimate the water surface area allen et al 2018 additionally the model parameters may have significant uncertainties which have not been investigated in this study human activities such as water extraction or point source discharges were not considered in the model water extraction from groundwater and stream water are ubiquitous agricultural activities significantly affecting soil evaporation groundwater outflow and even soil properties keery et al 2007 in this study we investigated the effect of changes in co2 and nitrogen inputs on stream water temperature primarily through the effect of plant growth although these human induced factors individually only provide minor contributions to the increase of water temperature and the impact of the co2 fertilization effect is still being debated the combination of those effects is considerable moreover a noticeable increasing trend of these human induced effects was found in 1st order streams which local studies also support terrer et al 2016 furthermore hot water releases from industry considered as thermal pollutants can strongly affect the health of aquatic ecosystems webb et al 2008 unfortunately it is not yet possible to incorporate this effect into the model due to the lack of century long data although we do not have large lakes and reservoirs in our study area future studies in different regions may have to consider the impact of dams and lakes the cooling effect of dams has been well documented in observations and modeling studies chen and fang 2015a king et al 1998 however the warming effect of dams is a debated topic too he et al 2020 kędra and wiejaczka 2018 6 conclusions in this study we investigated changes in stream water temperature by developing a water temperature module within the dlem modeling framework by linking the thermal energy balance of land and aquatic systems together this framework can address how land processes will likely affect water discharge and water temperature in the future here we applied and evaluated this model to the mid atlantic region of the u s filling a fundamental knowledge gap relating the impacts of climate and human disturbances on the water temperature of 1st and higher order streams we found that although climate variability is the dominant factor in regulating stream water temperature other environmental factors including land use conversions increased atmospheric co2 and nitrogen management efforts also play active roles in this problem especially for 1st order streams the rate of water temperature increase in 1st order streams is faster than that of higher order streams suggesting a hidden risk for local freshwater biodiversity future research will explore how changes in stream water temperatures will likely impact aquatic biogeochemistry in these systems since the study region does not have large lakes and reservoirs the missing component to represent the dam and lake routing and stratification would not influence the reliability of the model with the improved technology and increased availability of data remote sensing based methods are also prompting a new direction for estimating stream water temperature martí cardona et al 2019 better data model integrations in the future will likely enhance model capability in predicting 1st order stream and higher order stream water temperature and the associated biogeochemical cycles 7 data availability statements the relevant datasets of this study

4326,the accurate estimation of stream water temperature is essential for understanding environmental controls on the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems few studies have coupled soil and stream water temperatures to capture the synergy of thermal balances between terrestrial and riverine systems as a result little is known about how multiple environmental stresses have affected water temperature particularly for different orders of streams here we incorporated a new water transport scheme into the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem to predict water temperature in 1st order and higher order streams 1st order driven by a 4 km geo referenced dataset of multiple environmental factors our new water temperature model was utilized to predict the spatiotemporal variations of water temperature in the u s mid atlantic region during 1900 2015 results revealed that water temperature during 1970 2015 increased significantly p 0 05 and the rate of increase of the 1st order streams 0 32 c decade 1 is higher than that of higher order streams 0 28 c decade 1 the buffering effect of groundwater on water temperature in 1st order streams diminished under the context of climate warming factorial analysis showed that climate change and variability explain most of the changes 80 in stream water temperature since 1900 land use conversions mostly from cropland to forest co2 fertilization and land nitrogen management collectively explained a greater percent of change in water temperature in 1st order streams 24 than higher order streams 9 implying that 1st order streams are particularly vulnerable to human activities keywords dynamic land ecosystem model dlem global change mid atlantic region stream order water temperature 1 introduction stream water temperature is a fundamental physical variable reflecting the balance of thermal energy in aquatic systems chapra 2008 it has been well documented that stream water temperature can substantially affect the solubility of oxygen and other gases sander 2015 govern the decomposition or mineralization rate of organic matter pastor et al 2003 and regulate the fate of nitrogen harrison et al 2009 and phosphorus mcqueen and lean 1987 water temperature also moderates the metabolic rate of microorganisms claireaux et al 2000 and can shape the spatial distribution of habitats supporting aquatic species isaak et al 2010 given its importance to aquatic biogeochemistry and biodiversity significant efforts have been devoted to monitoring and estimation of water temperature van vliet et al 2013 although ubiquitous water discharge monitoring sites have been established worldwide water temperature observations are still lacking wanders et al 2019 a modeling approach is needed to construct the spatial and temporal patterns of stream water temperature across large regions empirical relationships derived from the regression analysis of observed water temperature and air temperature are commonly deployed in water quality models due to their relative simplicity leach and moore 2019 such relationships can provide reliable estimates of water temperature for regional studies because the regression parameters can be calibrated to match the data as a result the performance of an empirically based model strongly depends on the amount and quality of data from the study region if the environmental conditions change the skill of these models in predicting water temperature may drop arismendi et al 2014 the reason for this is that empirical relationships cannot represent the mechanisms of how environmental factors contribute to changes in stream water temperature this inherent weakness has hampered their application in long term studies where land use and land management change over time stream water temperature is highly sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances for instance water temperature has been increasing in streams draining to the chesapeake bay usa which aligns with the increase in air temperature in the region rice and jastram 2015 land management such as forest clear cutting can also significantly impact water temperature chen et al 2016 brown and krygier 1970 management of water resources such as dam construction or reservoir operations can cool or warm water temperature under different environmental conditions due to the changes in water surface area and the thermal energy leaking from the bottom of the reservoirs chen fang 2015b in recent years an improved understanding of the energy balance in streams has been obtained through field studies which has subsequently promoted the development of physically based approaches that incorporate climate and hydraulic variables into the energy balance equations these models have found applications at the basin level wu et al 2012 regional level buccola et al 2016 isaak et al 2017 continental level li et al 2015b and global level van vliet et al 2013 wanders et al 2019 physically based models can capture the changes in environmental conditions and provide reliable results for historical data reconstruction wanders et al 2019 and future projections ficklin et al 2014 wu et al 2012 however physically based models still need certain assumptions to simplify the processes that are not understood well or are too complex therefore empirical equations are commonly incorporated into physically based models to estimate water temperature of 1st order streams often as a boundary condition haag and luce 2008 van vliet et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge few studies presented the spatial distribution of stream temperature in headwaters over a large region the headwater zone known as the terrestrial aquatic interface has been recognized as a hotspot for greenhouse gas ghg emissions butman and raymond 2011 and has therefore prompted significant interest from both field research and modeling communities for example a recent study has suggested that headwater streams can be important refuges for cold water species under the risk of changing climate isaak et al 2016 although this study suggested that headwater zones can buffer the impact of climate small headwater streams have cooler water temperature in summer and warmer water temperature in winter than higher order streams they are particularly vulnerable to climate change and human activities especially when environmental change reaches a tipping point nepstad et al 2008 over the past century headwater zones have been heavily impacted by human and or natural disturbances isaak et al 2010 cover et al 2010 for example some studies have found 5 c increase in water temperature of headwater streams after fire disturbances suggesting a strong synergy between land surface processes and water temperature isaak et al 2010 koontz et al 2018 in this study we coupled a new water transport scheme called model for scale adaptive river transport mosart li et al 2013 li et al 2015b with our land ecosystem model dynamic land ecosystem model dlem tian et al 2015 we incorporated a physically based water temperature model into dlem we linked a simplified groundwater process to the stream water as a boundary condition and improved the model representation of the groundwater fed sub grid routing thermal energy exchanges within the 1st order streams the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of water temperature of head water streams and higher order 1st order streams from 1900 to 2015 across the mid atlantic region including the chesapeake bay and delaware bay watersheds and 2 isolate the contribution of environmental factors to stream water temperature across this region 2 methods 2 1 the dynamic land ecosystem model dlem the terrestrial processes were simulated by the dynamic land ecosystem model 2 0 dlem 2 0 fig 1 a which couples the major terrestrial water cycle liu et al 2013 pan et al 2015 with carbon nitrogen coupled vegetation dynamics tian et al 2012 chen et al 2013 to explicitly estimate plant growth soil biogeochemistry the associated water fluxes and greenhouse gas emissions in terrestrial ecosystems driven by the climate forcing and the anthropogenic disturbances the model has been successfully applied at relatively coarse resolutions such as 0 5 degrees global level or five arc minutes regional level tian et al 2015 in order to extend its range to higher resolutions sub grid processes were introduced into the terrestrial simulations by adapting a cohort unit the land use cohort divides each grid cell into five types of normalized vegetation coverage including the fraction of cropland four primary natural vegetation covers and six non vegetation types including urban impervious surface glacier lake stream ocean water and bare ground dlem has been previously improved to represent the riverine transport and thus is well suited for quantifying the lateral or vertical fluxes of water carbon tian et al 2015 and nitrogen yao et al 2020 from land to the oceans fig 1a a scale adaptive water transport scheme mosart model li et al 2013 was incorporated into the dlem aquatic module yao et al 2020 the new scheme separates the water transport process within a grid unit into hillslope routing subnetwork routing and main channel routing fig 1b hillslope routing is the water routing process that aggregates surface runoff and sends it to subnetworks groundwater pool receives water from subsurface runoff shallow groundwater flow and contributes to subnetworks with outflow rates derived from a fixed residence time which is empirically set to 2 days liu et al 2013 the subnetwork routing represents the hydrologic processes involving 1st order streams that receive water from overland flow and groundwater pool and then discharge to the main channel both hillslope and subnetwork routings are sub grid routing processes within a grid cell the main channel routing represents the routing process of higher order streams 2nd and higher order streams in a 4 km resolution grid cell for this study receiving flow from subnetworks and upstream grid cells and flowing to a downstream grid cell the dlem model uses the kinematic wave method for flow routing in channels chow 1964 which requires several hydrography variables e g flow direction channel length and channel slope and geomorphological parameters e g channel width and channel depth all this information was derived from the hydro1k and nhdplus hydrography datasets li et al 2015a yao et al 2021 in the water temperature module of dlem we simulated the thermal energy dynamics of 1st order subnetworks in the water transport scheme and higher order streams main channel flow in the water transport scheme separately thus we need to estimate the water surface area of both types of streams we obtained the surface area data from remote sensing products for the higher order streams and quantified the water surface area as of 1st order streams at which scale remotely sensed products are not available or reliable through an empirical relationship proposed by allen et al 2018 1 a s a rs w a t e r r e m o t e l y s e n s e d d a

community land model bonan et al 2013 the soil column in dlem was divided into 10 layers and the thickness of each layer was defined as 0 05 m 0 05 m 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 2 m 0 3 m 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 8 m and 1 0 m respectively we did not explicitly quantify the temperature of the vegetation canopy and the heat fluxes between the canopy and the soil surface thus we quantify the surface soil temperature by using a semi empirical method as the upper boundary condition of the soil layers which considers the effect of leaf area index lai and litter on soil temperature kang et al 2000 4 t j t j 1 a t j 1 e

scale adaptive water transport module and fully coupled it with the soil water temperature model of dlem fig 2 the energy balance within a stream segment is given by 5 δ t δ t h a 1 c ef a s h s h l h

plant canopies ha w is the sum of lateral heat fluxes including thermal inputs from upstream grid cells local subnetworks and downstream thermal energy loss note that t is in 0c and t is in s in this

and q g represent the surface runoff from hillslope and subsurface flow shallow groundwater m3 s 1 respectively t w h i l t w g and t w s u b represent the water temperature of hillslope flow groundwater and subnetworks respectively we assume that the water temperature of the hillslope flow is equal to the surface soil temperature t w g is defined as the average soil temperature from the surface to a given depth d w g note that as a simplification all the water and heat fluxes from the hillslopes and groundwater pool contribute directly to the first order streams in the model i e higher order streams do not receive water or heat flux from hillslopes this has a minimal effect on results because the total drainage area of hillslopes directly contributing to higher order streams

the model described above was applied to the chesapeake bay watershed and delaware river basin fig 3 both of which are located within the mid atlantic region of the northeast u s this is the most urbanized region of the country and sustains more than 25 5 million people the region covers more than 166 103 square kilometers of land surface and has experienced substantial land conversion due to reforestation over the past century hassett et al 2005 in this study we developed a 4 km resolution dataset of this region as model input to run the dlem model with climate land conversion and land management driving forces from 1900 to 2015 a potential vegetation map was reconstructed for the mid atlantic region by combining land use data obtained from the national land cover database nlcd jin et al 2013 https www mrlc gov the north american land change monitoring system www cec org naatlas and the global c4 vegetation map still et al 2003 we used the county level inventory data of cropland area and urban area to prescribe the land use change of natural vegetation waisanen and bliss 2002 a flowchart describing the generation of the historical land use land cover is shown in supplementary fig 2 as shown in fig 4 cropland area decreased by 57 3 fig 4d during the past 100 years this is primarily due to the 9 1 increase in forest area and the 507 5 increase in urban areas most of the urban expansion occurred surrounding the megacities including washington dc baltimore and philadelphia fig 4c we obtained historical climate variables from the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism climate dataset available at http www prism oregonstate edu including daily minimum mean and maximum temperature as well as precipitation at 4 km spatial resolution the mean annual precipitation was 1080 0 131 7 mm yr 1 and the annual mean temperature was 11 6 0 2 c during 1900 2015 respectively both precipitation and air temperature show significant increasing trends p 0 05 in mann kendall test from 1960 to 2015 with the rates of 3 3 mm yr 1 and 0 017 c decade 1 respectively the dlem nitrogen inputs include atmospheric nitrogen deposition nitrogen fertilizer use and manure nitrogen production we combined global nitrogen deposition and chesapeake bay program s data to reconstruct a long term product pan et al 2021 crop specific nitrogen fertilizer use from 1961 to 2008 was obtained from the national agricultural statistics service https quickstats nass usda gov manure nitrogen production data was derived from the usda county level livestock population data yang et al 2016 3 2 simulation experiments before running the simulations for the period 1900 2015 at a daily time step we first set up an equilibrium run for all the grid units the simulation was forced by the land use data of the year 1900 and the 30 year mean 1900 1929 climate data to represent the pre industrial environmental conditions other driving forces including atmospheric co2 concentration land use change and nitrogen inputs were kept at the pre industrial levels 1900 to exclude human disturbance the equilibrium run was terminated when carbon nitrogen and water pools reached a steady state thornton and rosenbloom 2005 after the equilibrium run was completed we conducted a 30 year spin up run with randomly selected climate variables from 1900 to 1929 the spin up run functions as a buffer to smooth the carbon and nitrogen fluxes between the equilibrium run and the year to year transient run tian et al 2012 finally we conducted a transient run for which all the driving forces change over time from year 1900 to 2015 we defined three free parameters including the ones associated with the water surface area cef in eq 5 and groundwater inputs kt in eq 4 and d w g for ground water temperature in equation 6 we first calibrated kt set as 0 5 and d w g set as 0 5 m to match the simulated water temperature of headwater streams to observed water temperature we then calibrated cef ranges from 0 7 0 9 of different stream orders to match with the associated observations supplementary table 1 the simulation with all the driving forces changing over time is recognized as the reference simulation s 1 in table 1 we conducted a factorial analysis to assess the contribution of environmental factors to the changes in water temperature we set up five simulations with each of the environmental factors held constant at year 1900 level s 2 7 in table 1 and the contribution of each environmental factor was calculated by comparing the simulated water temperature of each run with the reference simulation here climate effect refers to the joint effect of precipitation temperature relative humidity shortwave radiation and longwave radiation varying over time we also examined the effects induced by precipitation and air temperature alone by comparing s 6 and 7 to s 1 for consistency and ease of comparison all simulations used identical model parameter values i e those calibrated for s 1 4 results 4 1 model performance to assess the performance of the stream water temperature model we compared our model simulation results against the daily water temperature measurements at various sites collected by the united states geological survey usgs u s geological survey 2001 the sites are well distributed in the sub basins across the region fig 3 table 2 we calculated root mean square deviation rmsd nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r 2 to assess the performance of the dlem water temperature model in predicting the daily average water temperature table 2 supplementary fig 3 overall the modeled water temperatures agree well with the observations the average r 2 nse and rmsd values are 0 87 0 7 and 3 4 c respectively table 2 4 2 spatial and temporal patterns of water temperature to assess the spatial variation of stream water temperature we looked at the annual mean water temperatures averaged for the 2006 2015 period annual average water temperatures generally vary with latitude with most of the streams in the south having higher annual mean water temperatures 16 c 20 c than those in the north 8 c 14 c fig 5 topography also plays a role in shaping the spatial pattern of water temperature as can be seen in fig 5 the streams in the appalachian mountain region have consistently lower temperatures 4 c 12 c than the streams in the coastal plain 12 c 20 c both for 1st order streams and higher order streams fig 5 we analyzed the spatial and temporal pattern of water temperature within the higher order streams higher than 1st stream order fig 5a and 1st order streams fig 5b separately across the study region in general the annual mean water temperatures in the 1st order streams are slightly cooler than the annual mean water temperatures of the higher order streams about 68 of the higher order streams had annual mean water temperature above 12 c on the contrary around 57 of the first order streams had annual mean water temperature below 12 c in the megacities fig 3 fig 4c such as washington dc baltimore and philadelphia the annual mean water temperature reached 18 c 20 c in 1st order streams fig 5b but stream water temperature dropped quickly to 12 c 14 c at higher order streams fig 5a in the southeastern part of the study region the annual mean water temperature of 1st order streams is mostly around 12 c 14 c with the water temperature of the higher order streams reaching 16 c 20 c 4 3 long term changes in stream water temperature mean annual water temperature of 1st and higher order streams were calculated by taking arithmetic averages of each stream segment note that each cell contains a 1st order stream and a higher order stream the mean annual water temperature in higher order streams increased significantly p 0 05 in mann kendall test from 1900 to 2015 at a rate of 0 047 c decade 1 the warming rate was much higher in recent years 1970 2015 at 0 28 c decade 1 fig 6 c the water temperature in 1st order streams also increased significantly p 0 05 in mann kendall test during 1900 2015 with a rate of 0 065 c decade 1 and the rate reached 0 32 c decade 1 from 1970 to 2015 fig 6c we conducted student s t test to compare the average stream temperature of 1st order and higher order streams for the period 1900 2015 and found a significant difference p 0 01 fig 6c we also estimated flow weighted average water temperature of 1st order and higher order streams supplementary fig 4 we found that the increasing trend of water temperature within 1st order streams using the flow weighted average method 0 31 c decade 1 is comparable to that of the arithmetic average method 0 32 c decade 1 however the increasing trend in temperature in higher order streams based on the flow weighted average 0 22 c decade 1 is much lower than the one based on the arithmetic average 0 28 c decade 1 for the remainder of the paper average temperature refers to the arithmetic average to check whether these increases are statistically significant we applied the mann kendall trend test and theil sen linear regression to the 116 years of water temperature data at each grid cell fig 6a b about 52 of all the stream segments showed warming trend from 1900 to 2015 p 0 05 regardless of whether they were first or higher order streams fig 6d the increasing trend of water temperatures in 5th or 6th order streams figs 3 6a is not statistically significant p 0 05 and the associated trend is less than 0 02 c decade 1 from 1900 to 2015 in the inland portions of the study region stream water temperatures remained relatively stable with most of the grid cells having statistically insignificant trends p 0 05 over the past 116 years fig 6c however many 1st order streams showed a century long increasing trend only a few points had a statistically significant p 0 05 in mann kendall test decreasing trend of water temperature in both higher order streams and 1st order streams the stream water temperature of the northern regions had very small increasing or decreasing trends mostly p 0 05 with the rate ranging from 0 001 c decade 1 to 0 02c decade 1 surprisingly many of the streams in the southern portion of the study region where the annual average stream temperature is highest fig 6 have a slightly decreasing water temperature around 0 05 c decade 1 4 4 attributing the contribution of environmental factors to changes in stream water temperature the factorial analysis showed that climate factors i e temperature and precipitation explain about 80 of the changes in stream water temperatures across the mid atlantic from 1900 to 2015 figs 7 and 8 in the 1970s the climate impact on water temperature in higher order streams and 1st order streams diminished to 30 and 4 4 respectively figs 7 and 8 primarily due to the similarity of the climate between the 1900s and 1970s the decadal mean air temperature of the 1900s 10 44 c was very close to that of the 1970s 10 53 c fig 4 land use conversion accounts for 37 and 61 of the changes in water temperature in higher order streams and 1st order streams respectively during the 1970s figs 7 and 8 nitrogen inputs and increases in atmospheric co2 contribute more than 30 of the increase in water temperature in higher order streams and 1st order streams in the 1970s after the 1970s the contribution of land use co2 and n inputs to the changes in water temperature of higher order streams dropped to 10 but they still account for 20 of the changes in 1st order stream water temperature fig 7 4 5 sensitivity of stream water temperature in response to the groundwater input our model assumes that the temperature of the seepage from groundwater is equal to the mean soil temperature of a defined depth dw g 0 5 m to examine the sensitivity of groundwater input parameter on modeled stream water temperature we run the model dw g given as 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 m respectively we then plotted the simulated daily water temperature at two usgs sites of the delaware river 01428750 3rd order and 01460300 5th order fig 9 from 2000 to 2001 this sensitivity analysis suggests that water temperature continuously drops with increased dw g and a noticeable time lag was detected at both sites when dw g changed from 0 1 m to 2 m especially for the delaware river sites located at higher order streams we compared the model performances for different d w g values the performances were similar for d w g 0 1 m and 0 5 m r2 0 77 nse 0 71 rmsd 3 9 for 0 1 m r2 0 76 nse 0 7 rmsd 4 0 for 0 5 m the model performance decreased significantly once d w g became larger than 0 5 m r2 0 7 nse 0 64 rmsd 4 4 for d w g 1m r2 0 58 nse 0 53 rmsd 5 0 for d w g 2m 5 discussion 5 1 the impact of climate on the stream water temperature air temperature is the dominant driver of the increase and variability in stream water temperature the spatial pattern of the warming trend of water temperature fig 6d follows that of air temperature fig 4f with both water and air temperatures increasing in coastal regions and decreasing in the mountain regions air temperature primarily influences water temperature in two pathways 1 thermal energy is exchanged between the air and water interface arismendi et al 2014 and 2 rising air temperature influences land surface temperature and indirectly impacts the temperature of shallow groundwater and the adjacent 1st order streams kurylyk et al 2015 menberg et al 2014 using data from 129 usgs sites rice and jastram 2015 found that since the 1970s stream water temperatures and air temperature across the chesapeake bay watershed are increasing at statistically significant p 0 05 in mann kendall test rates at 0 28 c decade 1 and 0 23 c decade 1 respectively since most of the observation sites in rice and jastram s 2015 study were located in higher order streams the magnitude of the increasing trend in their study is consistent with the dlem estimated rate of increase 0 28 c decade 1 of water temperature in higher order streams from 1970 to 2015 across the whole mid atlantic region however dlem based results suggest a higher rate of increase of water temperature 0 32 c decade 1 in 1st order streams overall the contribution of air temperature to the changes in water temperature in higher order streams is consistent with that of 1st order streams in our factorial analysis fig 8a thus the higher rate of increase of water temperature in 1st order streams must come from other environmental factors precipitation is another dominant climate variable that significantly influences stream water temperature a higher precipitation rate would enlarge the water surface area in the headwater zone which accelerates the thermal energy exchange between air and water equation 5 on the other hand the increase in precipitation results in cooling of groundwater discharge in summer and warming in winter briggs et al 2018 which substantially buffers the seasonal variations of water temperature in both 1st order and higher order streams burns et al 2017 snyder et al 2015 additionally increased precipitation cools the land surface even though evaporative energy release also contributes to the changes in water temperature trenberth and shea 2005 our factorial experiments suggest that the contribution of precipitation to 1st order stream temperature is more significant than that for higher order streams fig 8b we only considered the contribution of the absolute value of air temperature and precipitation because of the variations in climate conditions that do not account for the long term changes that is because the increased precipitation substantially increased groundwater discharge the 1st order streams which have considerable groundwater and surface water exchanges show less seasonal variation than the main river channels thus 1st order streams are conventionally thought of as a refugia for species in relation to climate change due to the cooling effect of groundwater discharge during the summer season ficklin et al 2014 isaak et al 2016 snyder et al 2015 a recent study found that the thermal energy of water seepage from shallow groundwater increased significantly with the rising land surface temperature in the blue ridge mountains of the u s briggs et al 2018 the refugia of cold water species would disappear soon due to global warming leach and moore 2019 similarly we found a faster rate of increase of temperature in groundwater fed 1st order streams across the mid atlantic region fig 6c leach and moore 2019 also reached a similar conclusion at the catchment level using a process based study 5 2 land conversion effects on water temperature land use change shows a tremendous impact on water temperature in higher order streams and 1st order streams as predicted by dlem water temperature in urban streams reached 18 c 20 c in 2015 which is higher than the water temperature of the sub urban regions fig 5b simulation results suggest that water temperature in 1st order streams is susceptible to urbanization however the effect of land use change on water temperatures quickly dampened while water flows into 2nd or higher order streams fig 5a because the contribution of advective heat fluxes on water temperature was significantly enhanced due to the increased water surface area the study region experienced a significant re forestation from cropland and de forestation due to urbanization during the last century fig 4a which contributed to the substantial changes in water temperature that is because we considered the effects of plant lai on soil surface temperature equation 5 which could have cascading effects on the water temperature in 1st order streams and higher order streams forests have higher lai than that of cropland and urban impervious surface and this shading effect of forest canopy results in cooler waters in the mountain region fig 5 on the other hand the changes in vegetation types resulted in different ground litter depth and surface albedo which are directly linked to the soil evaporative energy release we found that water temperature in areas dominated by forests or grassland is much lower than in urban areas due to the higher evapotranspiration rates which has been implicitly represented in dlem fig 5 additionally we found a significant warmer water temperature in 1st order streams adjacent to the megacities fig 6 a b these stream temperature surges directly link to the loss of biomass cover and a warmer air temperature urban heat island due to rapid urbanization which is also supported by the catchment scale modeling and field observation studies leblanc et al 1997 nelson et al 2009 nelson and palmer 2007 5 3 effect of groundwater on water temperature earth system models and hydrological models do not explicitly simulate the lateral transport of groundwater from the soil root zone to the tributary streams thus simplification is needed in the definition of the 1st order stream temperatures or seepage groundwater temperature most of the previous modeling studies used empirical models to represent the water temperature of the headwater zone the empirically based headwater temperature estimates were used as boundary conditions to force the water temperature models brown 1969 van vliet et al 2013 van vliet et al 2012 van wijk and de vries 1963 wanders et al 2019 wu et al 2012 thus the sensitivity of water temperature in response to the boundary condition has not been thoroughly investigated especially for the large rivers 4th and higher climatic and hydraulics variables including surface area air temperature and radiation were conventionally considered as the dominant drivers li et al 2015b wu et al 2012 therefore proper representation of the temperature of the seepage from groundwater is of great importance during the coupling of the land model with riverine transport li et al 2015a suggested that the boundary condition of the groundwater seepage temperature is from the water table to the bottom of the root zone 5 m depth in the community land model oleson et al 2010 which is much deeper than that in this study coupling of surface and ground water processes will be needed in the future for improved water temperature estimates in streams as the depth of the water table may be very different in different topographies and climates 5 4 comparison to other models the dlem water temperature module has a comparable performance to other representative models conducted at different scales ficklin et al 2012 van vliet et al 2012 wu et al 2012 yearsley 2012 the average nse of the previous studies varies from 0 50 to 0 70 which is slightly lower than the values in this study the ranges of r2 and rmsd in previous studies are about 0 8 0 9 and 2 0 4 0 respectively which are in agreement with our results however improving the prediction of stream water temperature was not the primary goal of this study this is the first study to our knowledge that fully coupled a terrestrial ecosystem model with a physically based water temperature model empirically based models which commonly use air temperature as the sole variable to predict the water temperature can achieve a better accuracy over process based models because their simple structures allow adequate parameterization brown 1969 chen and fang 2015b mohseni et al 1998 segura et al 2014 wehrly et al 2009 however there is a growing debate on if air temperature could be used as the sole indicator of water temperature arismendi et al 2014 the reliability of empirical equations would be substantially hampered by the changes in hydrological conditions or land use cover arismendi et al 2014 our study showed that the rate of increase of water temperature in 1st order streams is higher than that of air temperature fig 6 c which cannot be captured by empirical models this and other findings imply that empirical equations may not be reliable for long term predictions due to the lack of mechanistic representation which is also supported by a catchment level study within the columbia river basin leach and moore 2019 5 5 uncertainties and future work although this model is process based we still used several semi empirical equations to represent the physical processes for instance we conducted a semi empirical based method to estimate the water surface area allen et al 2018 additionally the model parameters may have significant uncertainties which have not been investigated in this study human activities such as water extraction or point source discharges were not considered in the model water extraction from groundwater and stream water are ubiquitous agricultural activities significantly affecting soil evaporation groundwater outflow and even soil properties keery et al 2007 in this study we investigated the effect of changes in co2 and nitrogen inputs on stream water temperature primarily through the effect of plant growth although these human induced factors individually only provide minor contributions to the increase of water temperature and the impact of the co2 fertilization effect is still being debated the combination of those effects is considerable moreover a noticeable increasing trend of these human induced effects was found in 1st order streams which local studies also support terrer et al 2016 furthermore hot water releases from industry considered as thermal pollutants can strongly affect the health of aquatic ecosystems webb et al 2008 unfortunately it is not yet possible to incorporate this effect into the model due to the lack of century long data although we do not have large lakes and reservoirs in our study area future studies in different regions may have to consider the impact of dams and lakes the cooling effect of dams has been well documented in observations and modeling studies chen and fang 2015a king et al 1998 however the warming effect of dams is a debated topic too he et al 2020 kędra and wiejaczka 2018 6 conclusions in this study we investigated changes in stream water temperature by developing a water temperature module within the dlem modeling framework by linking the thermal energy balance of land and aquatic systems together this framework can address how land processes will likely affect water discharge and water temperature in the future here we applied and evaluated this model to the mid atlantic region of the u s filling a fundamental knowledge gap relating the impacts of climate and human disturbances on the water temperature of 1st and higher order streams we found that although climate variability is the dominant factor in regulating stream water temperature other environmental factors including land use conversions increased atmospheric co2 and nitrogen management efforts also play active roles in this problem especially for 1st order streams the rate of water temperature increase in 1st order streams is faster than that of higher order streams suggesting a hidden risk for local freshwater biodiversity future research will explore how changes in stream water temperatures will likely impact aquatic biogeochemistry in these systems since the study region does not have large lakes and reservoirs the missing component to represent the dam and lake routing and stratification would not influence the reliability of the model with the improved technology and increased availability of data remote sensing based methods are also prompting a new direction for estimating stream water temperature martí cardona et al 2019 better data model integrations in the future will likely enhance model capability in predicting 1st order stream and higher order stream water temperature and the associated biogeochemical cycles 7 data availability statements the relevant datasets of this study

4327,an extreme drought on record occurred in eastern china in 2019 and caused severe terrestrial water storage tws deficits it is important to understand this drought process and assess its impacts we combine the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace observations and land surface model lsm outputs to thoroughly investigate this drought event to consolidate the quantitative analysis we fuse five sets of grace derived tws data and four sets of lsm based soil moisture storage sms data respectively using the generalized three cornered hat method and the least square method and thereby generate robust tws and sms results both the grace and lsm results suggest that this drought event started in july in northeastern and northern china and then spread south to southern china in august and lasted until december influencing a vast area of 2 0 106 km2 in eastern china the drought center first appeared in north china then moved southward to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and finally stayed in south china tws results from grace show that the largest regional tws deficit was 94 1 17 7 mm and happened in september in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin sms results from lsms exhibit similar spatiotemporal characteristics to the grace results but with smaller magnitudes meteorological drought composite index from the china meteorological administration agrees well with the grace derived tws deficits and lsm based sms deficits in terms of their spatiotemporal distributions these three independent indicators together identify and assess this severe drought event providing us a quantitative understanding of it the water budget analysis demonstrates that the precipitation deficit in the second half of 2019 is the main reason for this drought event the precipitation deficit is mainly due to the northerly wind anomaly and sinking anomaly over eastern china which are closely associated with the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the western pacific keywords china drought terrestrial water storage grace land surface model precipitation 1 introduction drought is one of the main natural hazards with potentially catastrophic effects on the environment agriculture and economy and also an important scientific issue wilhite 2000 sternberg and troy 2011 wahr and john 2004 grayson 2013 monitoring and quantifying drought induced water storage change is meaningful for understanding drought processes which in turn benefits water resource management especially in the context that population growth and economic development intensify the water resource pressure and climate extremes are expected to occur more frequently cihlar et al 1997 leblanc et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 long et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 however quantifying drought and its hydrological impacts remains a major challenge due to limited large scale comprehensive monitoring means the launch of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites in 2002 provided a new mean to monitor and assess drought event grace observes the earth s time varying gravity field that results from mass redistribution after removal of the contributions of mass transports from the atmosphere the ocean and the earth s interior the gravity variations are mainly due to terrestrial water storage tws changes wahr et al 1998 tws changes derived from grace are the first ever quantification of integrated storage of surface and subsurface water over land wahr and john 2004 syed et al 2008 and have been widely used to monitor the hydrologic variations in response to droughts grace stopped service in july 2017 and its successor grace follow on grace fo started to operate in may 2018 providing us long term gravity field change data many scientists have used grace observations to study drought events yirdaw et al 2008 used grace to investigate the 2003 canadian prairie drought and proposed a drought indicator based on grace estimated tws chen et al 2009 used the non seasonal change of grace estimated tws to detect the 2005 drought in the central amazon basin leblanc et al 2009 assessed the response of water resources and the propagation of the water deficit through the hydrological cycle during the early 21st century multiyear drought in southeast australia using grace data in situ hydrological data and model data long et al 2013 estimated a tws depletion of 62 3 17 7 km3 during the 2011 drought in texas using grace derived tws changes thomas et al 2014 presented a quantitative approach for measuring hydrological drought occurrence and severity based on grace data sinha et al 2017 expanded the work of thomas et al 2014 and devised a drought index to quantify drought intensity and severity using grace estimated tws variations in addition to using grace to directly monitoring drought grace estimated tws has been assimilated into land surface models zaitchik et al 2008 li et al 2012 li et al 2019 and subsequently integrated into the north american drought monitor houborg et al 2012 and a groundwater drought indicator li et al 2019 grace solutions from different organizations have some discrepancies due to different data processing strategies sakumura et al 2014 save et al 2018 dahle et al 2018 yuan 2018 kvas et al 2019 göttl et al 2018 performed an assessment of the rl06 grace data from the center for space research csr at the university of texas the helmholtz centre potsdam german research centre for geosciences gfz and jet propulsion laboratory jpl and found that mass changes and excitation functions derived from the three datasets have certain discrepancies mu et al 2020 analyzed mass changes derived from rl06 level 2 solutions from the above three organizations and showed that mass changes derived from the three grace solutions had different trend patterns in the north china plain the bohai sea and the east china sea and had different annual amplitudes in the bohai sea however most of the existed studies on drought monitoring used single grace solutions which may give unreliable results due to discrepancies among different grace solutions zhang et al 2020 in addition the 2019 china drought has not been thoroughly investigated this motivates us to conduct a comprehensive investigation into this drought event using merged grace solutions and land surface model lsm outputs through this study we expect to 1 robustly quantify tws changes in response to the 2019 china drought using different datasets and 2 explain the meteorological drivers for this drought 2 research area and data 2 1 study region we focus our research area on mainland china where a historic drought happened in 2019 the topography of the research area is displayed in fig 1 this drought event was mainly located in eastern china where the climate system is predominated by the monsoon the climate in eastern china is characterized by heat and humidity in summer and cold and dryness in winter which results from the seasonal alternation between warm moist airflow from the pacific to inland and dry cold airflow from the mainland accordingly precipitation in eastern china varies seasonally with the monsoon and concentrates mostly in summer to facilitate the characterization of the spatiotemporal distribution of the drought we delimit three subregions in eastern china i e the nc region covering most of the north china plain and surrounding areas the yr region covering most of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and surrounding areas and the sc region covering most of south china the boundaries of the three subregions are also presented in fig 1 in this study we combine the grace data the lsm output and a drought index to quantitatively investigate the tws changes in the research area during this drought event 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace data we use the latest release of monthly 1 gridded land water storage data rl06 based on three grace grace fo spherical harmonic sh solutions provided by csr gfz and jpl respectively these water storage data are derived from grace and grace fo time varying gravity observations and expressed in centimeters of equivalent water height ewh landerer and swenson 2012 the three organizations have applied several post processing corrections to their sh solutions to isolate the terrestrial water storage signal the c20 spherical harmonic coefficients have been replaced with the solutions from satellite laser ranging cheng 2011 the degree 1 coefficients geocenter motion have been estimated using the method from swenson et al 2008 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia has been corrected using the model from geruo et al 2013 a destriping filter has been applied to minimize the effects of correlated errors swenson and wahr 2006 to minimize the effects of correlated errors and high frequency errors the spherical harmonic solutions have been smoothed with a 300 km wide gaussian filter to relieve attenuation effects caused by truncating and smoothing the grace tws products are scaled by a set of gain factors based on national center for atmospheric research s community land model v4 0 data oleson et al 2008 landerer and swenson 2012 long et al 2014a long et al 2014b thomas et al 2014 we also use the monthly global tws data derived from two mascon solutions provided by csr and jpl the jpl mascon is the release 6 version 1 with the coastal resolution improvement filter wiese et al 2018 the csr mascon is the release 6 version 2 0 save et al 2016 the c20 degree 2 order 0 coefficients of csr mascon and jpl mascon solutions have been replaced with the solutions from satellite laser ranging according to loomis et al 2019 and cheng 2011 respectively the c30 coefficients have been replaced with the solutions from satellite laser ranging loomis et al 2019 for csr grace fo solutions the degree 1 coefficients geocenter motion of csr and jpl mascon solutions have been estimated using the estimates in tn 13a from landerer 2019 and the methods from sun et al 2016 and swenson et al 2008 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia of the csr and jpl mascon solutions has been corrected using the ice6g d model from richard peltier et al 2018 these two mascon solutions together with the three sh solutions of monthly grace and grace fo tws changes in 2002 2019 are derived and used in this study for convenience the water storage data based on the three sh solutions and the two mascon solutions are termed as csr tws gfz tws jpl tws csr m tws and jpl m tws hereafter 2 2 2 land surface models we use the simulated soil moisture content snow water equivalent and canopy water from four lsms in global land data assimilation system version 1 gldas 1 the four lsms are the clm2 0 model the mosaic model the noah 2 7 model and the vic model their spatial resolution is 1 and temporal resolution is one month the depths of simulated soil moisture content are 3 4 m for clm2 0 3 5 m for mosaic 2 m for noah 2 7 and 1 9 m for vic rodell et al 2004 water storage in the reservoirs is not included in these models we compute the sum of the soil moisture content the snow water equivalent and the canopy water and label the sum as soil moisture storage sms hereafter monthly gridded sms data from 2002 to 2019 based on the four lsms are calculated and utilized in this research 2 2 3 other hydrometeorological data era5 is the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate monthly total precipitation evaporation 2 m temperature runoff 500 hpa geopotential 500 hpa vertical velocity and 850 hpa horizontal wind velocity data from era5 are used the time period is 2002 2019 and their spatial resolution is 1 the ecmwf reanalysis preserves closure of the water balance and it has been proven to perform well in the representation of the hydrological cycle and the quality of precipitation and tropospheric circulation through a comparison with ground based and remote sensing observations dee et al 2011 huang et al 2013a huang et al 2013b huang et al 2015 balsamo et al 2015 hersbach et al 2020 which makes it suitable for this study we also use the monthly meteorological drought composite index mci collected from the china meteorological administration cma national climate center in 2019 from 2400 stations in mainland china to identify the drought and quantify its intensity the mci has been widely used in national and provincial drought monitoring operational systems in china since 2012 this drought index considers the combined effects of recent effective precipitation monthly evapotranspiration and seasonal and near semi annual precipitation it is suitable for the daily dynamic monitoring and assessment of the meteorological drought mci is defined as follows 1 mci k a a s p i w 60 b m i 30 c s p i 90 d s p i 150 where spi w 60 denotes the past 60 days standardized weighted precipitation index which is used as a proxy for effective precipitation m i 30 denotes the past 30 days relative moisture index which is used to quantitatively describe the balance between precipitation and evaporation sp i 90 and sp i 150 are the past 90 days and the past 150 days standardized precipitation index values a b c and d are the weights of the above four indexes whose values are set to 0 3 0 5 0 3 0 2 in northern china and 0 5 0 6 0 2 0 1 in southern china by the cma ka is the seasonal adjustment coefficient provided by the cma which is determined according to the sensitivity of main crops to soil moisture at different growth stages in different seasons and different regions the categorization of the drought grade according to the mci is displayed in table 1 3 fusing different datasets we remove 2005 2010 means from the grace tws and lsm sms time series respectively to ensure they have the same reference period hereafter our analyses will be based on these data since discrepancies usually exist among different datasets one may obtain contradictory results and conclusions when using different single datasets to eliminate the discrepancies induced by data and improve the reliability of the results we will first use a generalized three cornered hat method gtch to estimate the relative uncertainties of the grace tws lsm sms data and then fuse them according to their uncertainties using a least square method 3 1 the generalized three cornered hat method since the uncertainties of the grace tws estimates and the lsm sms estimates are unclear we need to estimate them first here we use the gtch method to estimate the relative covariances for the five grace data and four lsm data respectively the classic three cornered hat method was first introduced by gray and allan 1974 and its generalized version was further developed by premoli and tavella 1993 tavella and premoli 1994 galindo and palacio 1999 and galindo et al 2001 this method can estimate relative covariances of different datasets without a priori knowledge as long as at least three datasets exist long et al 2014a long et al 2014b long et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 it has been proven effective in estimating covariances of grace data and lsm data long et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 technical details about the gtch method can be found in section s1 of the supplementary material sm 3 2 data fusion we applied the gtch method to the tws estimates from five grace datasets to estimate their relative covariances then we fused the five tws estimates by taking a weighted average of them 2 x i 1 n w i x i where x i and w i denotes the tws estimates from the individual grace solution and its corresponding weights the weights are determined based on the estimated variances using eq 3 3 w i 1 r ii n 1 n 1 r nn where r ii is the variance of the ith tws time series estimated by the gtch method here we neglect the correlations between different datasets since the gtch method may not give good estimation for the correlations koot et al 2006 the above processes are performed grid by grid until we obtained all the covariances of the five datasets and fused them on all the grid nodes the same processing is also applied to the four lsm datasets we also obtained their relative uncertainties and fused results on the same grid nodes with the grace data 4 results 4 1 uncertainties of terrestrial water storage change estimates the relative uncertainties i e the square root of the variance estimated by the gtch method for the five grace based tws changes and the four lsm based sms changes are shown in figs 2 and 3 among the five grace tws changes tws change estimates from the three sh solutions show smaller uncertainties than those from the two mascon solutions in mainland china specifically tws change estimates from the three grace sh solutions typically exhibit uncertainties lower than 20 mm in the research area tws change estimates from the two grace mascon solutions show uncertainties greater than 20 mm in most regions especially the uncertainties are higher than 50 mm in some regions of north china plain southeastern china the southern tibetan plateau the eastern kunlun mountains and the western tianshan mountains the uncertainties of the four sms datasets exhibit similar spatial patterns that are characterized by higher uncertainties in southern and eastern china than in northern and western china in northeastern china southern china and tibetan plateau the four sms datasets generally have uncertainties higher than 40 mm especially the uncertainties of mosaic sms are over 100 mm in some regions of southern china the four perform similarly in northwestern china with uncertainties mostly lower than 20 mm we sort the uncertainties from all the grid nodes in the research area in ascending order and take the median one to represent the uncertainty of the whole research area this is done for different grace tws and lsm sms results and the results are presented in table 2 it suggests that the grace tws changes have lower uncertainties average medium 15 7 mm than the lsm sms changes average medium 37 1 mm csr tws generates the lowest uncertainty among the five grace tws results with a medium of 8 4 mm followed by the gfz tws with a medium of 9 1 mm and the jpl tws with a medium of 13 2 mm the tws changes from the two mascon solutions show larger uncertainties than that from the three sh solutions with the mediums of 21 7 mm for the csr m tws and 26 3 mm for the jpl m tws among the four lsm sms changes the clm sms exhibits the lowest uncertainty with a medium of 27 5 mm followed by the noah sms with a medium of 33 2 mm the vic sms with a medium of 43 6 mm and the mosaic sms with a medium of 43 9 mm based on the variances estimated by the gtch method we fuse the five grace tws estimates and four lsm sms estimates respectively to yield the fused results fig s1 shows the tws changes estimated from the five individual grace data for july december 2019 while fig 4 shows the fused estimates fig s2 shows the sms changes estimated from the four individual lsm sms estimates while fig 5 shows the fused estimates among the five grace tws estimates tws estimates from the three sh solutions exhibit similar magnitudes while that from the two mascon solutions show relatively large magnitudes fig s1 comparing fig 3 and fig s1 it s observed that the fused tws estimates exhibit similar magnitudes to the tws estimates from the three sh solutions this is expected since the three sh solutions have smaller uncertainties and thus have larger weights in data fusing than the two mascon solutions fig 2 and table 2 the five grace tws estimates and the fused estimates agree well in their spatiotemporal patterns meanwhile the four lsm sms estimates and the fused sms estimates show significant discrepancies in magnitudes but have similar spatiotemporal patterns the magnitudes of clm sms estimates are much smaller than those of the other three sms estimates the mosaic sms estimates exhibit the greatest magnitudes the fused sms estimates exhibit moderate magnitudes that lie in the middle of the four sms estimates we use the maximum differences between the fused tws estimates and the five individual grace tws estimates as the final uncertainties of the fused tws hereafter this also applies to the fused sms estimates in this way we give a natural confidence interval of 100 for the fused tws and sms estimates the uncertainties of the fused tws and sms estimates for july december 2019 are displayed in figs 4 and 5 respectively the fused tws estimates typically show larger uncertainties in some regions of north china plain southeastern china the southern tibetan plateau the eastern kunlun mountains and the western tianshan mountains for the fused sms spatial distribution patterns of its uncertainties are basically characterized by higher uncertainties in southern and eastern china than in northern and western china 4 2 estimating tws sms anomalies in average cases the tws and sms are mainly characterized by seasonal variations and or long term trends accompanied by some irregular fluctuations including errors we use eq 4 to describe the average states of the tws and sms s temporal variations 4 s t a 0 a 1 t t 0 b 1 cos 2 π t b 2 sin 2 π t c 1 cos 4 π t c 2 sin 4 π t where t denotes time in years t0 is the start time of the time series a0 a1 b1 b2 c1 and c2 are the coefficients to be determined what is different from previous studies e g thomas et al 2014 is that we take the linear trend into account since linear trends in tws sms temporal changes exist in some regions in china rodell et al 2018 gerdener et al 2020 we use eq 4 to fit and remove the long term trend and the seasonal variations from the tws sms time series grid by grid the residual time series depict the deviations from the normal state and are treated as anomalies using eq 4 we estimate the monthly tws anomalies and their uncertainties which are shown in fig 6 it shows that significant tws deficits first appeared in northeastern and northern china in july and then spread south to southern china in august since then the tws deficit covered most of eastern china and lasted into december the tws deficit peaked in september and then slightly alleviated given its magnitude and covering extent we take the maximum regional tws deficit as the tws deficit center fig 6 suggests that the center of the tws deficit migrated from north china southward to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and finally to south china it should be noted that yunnan province and northwestern china also experienced tws deficit during the same period but their temporal patterns are not similar to that in eastern china they may have different drivers in this study we focus on the tws deficit in eastern china to quantitatively understand the intensity and the spatiotemporal variations of the tws deficits we divide the region of interest into three subregions as outlined in fig 1 we calculate monthly regional average tws anomalies in ewh and regional volume water storage anomalies in cubic kilometers which are displayed in table 3 the nc region first experienced the tws deficit in july with a mean negative tws change of 33 13 7 mm and then the deficit increased to a peak of 75 6 4 9 mm in september after that the deficit turned to decrease till december reaching a magnitude of 35 12 9 mm the yr region showed a similar pattern to the nc region till september but after that the tws deficit decreased first and then followed by an increasing trend to december and the maximum tws deficit appeared in september with a magnitude of 94 1 17 7 mm the sc region presented different patterns from the nc region or the yr region it had positive tws anomalies in july and started to show small tws deficits in august and september and after that the tws deficit presented an increasing trend and reached a maximum in december with a magnitude of 85 2 19 8 mm this indicates that the tws deficit started earlier in northern and central china than in southern china the nc yr and sc regions lost huge water with peak magnitudes of 70 4 4 6 km3 67 6 12 7 km3 and 27 9 6 5 km3 respectively during the six months the maximum water deficit of the whole research area reached 143 8 17 km3 equivalent to the capacity of 3 7 three gorges reservoirs all the above suggest that a severe drought happened in the second half of 2019 and caused great tws deficits in a vast area of eastern china since the soil moisture content is an important component of the tws and directly reflects the drought condition we further investigate the sms anomalies during this drought event the monthly sms anomalies derived from the fused lsm data are computed and shown in fig 7 similar to the tws deficits large scale negative sms anomalies are observed in northeastern and northern china in july in august the negative sms anomalies migrated south to the yr region meanwhile most of the sms anomalies in northeastern and northern china turned positive in september most of the nc region and nearly the whole yr region had negative sms anomalies the sms deficit further spread south to the sc region in october covering almost the whole eastern china the sms deficit slightly alleviated in november and then lasted into december the center of negative sms anomalies first appeared in north china and then moved southward to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin the spatial patterns of sms anomalies in eastern china are largely consistent with those of grace tws anomalies which consolidates the characterization of the spatiotemporal distribution of water storage deficits we spatially integrated gridded sms anomalies within each subregion to obtain the regional total sms anomalies in km3 in three subregions as well as calculating regional average sms anomalies in mm which are displayed in table 4 sms in the nc region first showed a negative anomaly in july with a mean deficit of 22 4 17 2 mm changed to a weak positive anomaly 0 9 13 1 mm in august and then turned to a significant negative anomaly 25 8 20 0 mm in september after that this sms deficit increased and peaked in october with a magnitude of 25 9 19 9 mm 24 1 18 5 km3 and followed by a decreasing trend to december the yr region first experienced surplus sms with a positive anomaly of 32 3 78 0 mm in july after that this region experienced five months of sms deficit until december its sms deficit increased first to a peak deficit of 80 4 53 1 mm 56 8 37 6 km3 in october and then decreased sms in the sc region exhibited positive anomalies from july to september and then in october turned to a negative anomaly which intensified from october to december and finally got a peak magnitude of 64 7 39 0 mm 19 0 11 5 km3 the regional sms anomalies displayed similar spatiotemporal behaviors with the regional tws anomalies in the three subregions in july december 2019 they together reveal the process of this severe drought event although lsm based sms anomalies exhibited similar spatiotemporal patterns to the grace derived tws anomalies we cannot neglect the discrepancies between them sms deficits tended to be smaller than tws deficits this is attributed to the fact that sms is only a component of tws and does not count the water storage changes in the reservoirs and underground it is also observed that the sms in the nc region exhibited some positive anomalies in august meanwhile the tws showed negative anomalies we infer that human activities e g groundwater fed irrigation water projects such as reservoir impounding and south to north water diversion induced this divergence between sms changes and tws changes long et al 2017 4 3 comparing water storage deficits with cma drought index fig 8 displays monthly mci drought indexes from nearly 2400 stations in china for the period of july december 2019 results show that the mci identified meteorological drought initially occurred in the nc region in july most of the nc region was characterized by a drought grade of d2 and a few by d3 in august the drought spread south to the northern yr region while the drought in the nc region was alleviated in september the drought spread more southern with more areas becoming severe drought d3 in october the drought intensified in the yr region especially in jiangxi province where d4 drought occurred meanwhile the drought spread more southern covering the whole sc region in contrast the drought in most of the nc region largely eased in november the drought in the sc region developed further with higher levels while drought in the yr region eased slightly in december the drought in the yr and nc regions was largely relieved and the drought was mainly located in the sc region and measured as the d3 drought in general this drought event had a distinct feature that the drought center initiated in northern china and migrated southward the mci agrees well with the grace tws and the lsm sms deficits in identifying this drought event and characterizing its spatiotemporal patterns these three indicators together identify this severe drought event and reveal its evolution process however some discrepancies are also observed for instance the mci identified drought in the nc region was alleviated in august but the magnitude of the tws deficit remained almost the same as in july and similar discrepancies were also observed in the nc and sc regions in december this is because mci assesses the meteorological drought depending on precipitation and evapotranspiration while the grace tws measures the vertically integrated water storage according to the water balance principle the deficit in the tws over a particular region is more likely to be compensated by greater than normal net precipitation precipitation minus evaporation and unlikely recovered under ongoing meteorological drought comparing figs 7 and 8 it is observed that sms anomalies agree better with mci in characterizing spatiotemporal variations of this drought than tws anomalies for instance the sms anomalies and mci both show the water deficit or drought in the nc region was largely relieved in august but the tws anomalies don t and the sms anomalies and mci both show that the sc region first experienced the drought in october while the tws anomalies showed this region first experienced the drought in august the rationale behind this is that sms has a more quick and direct response to precipitation and evapotranspiration than the tws the response of tws to meteorological drought generally delays as it needs time to propagate from the shallow surface to the deep underground mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 4 4 reasons for the drought event according to the water balance principle tws change is the result of subtracting runoff r and evapotranspiration e from precipitation p which can be expressed as 5 ds p e r where ds is the tws change here we investigate how p r and e contributed to the tws deficits in this drought event the 1 gridded monthly total p e and r for the period of 2002 2019 are collected from era5 for each grid node we compute the p e and r anomalies by removing their 2002 2019 mean for each month of july december for instance the p anomalies in july 2019 are the result of removing the july means of 2002 2019 from the p in july 2019 figs s3 and s4 of the supplementary material show the monthly anomalies of e and r from july to december in 2019 it demonstrates that e exhibited weak anomalies 40 5 39 1 mm in july december 2019 and its spatiotemporal patterns are inconsistent with the tws deficits implying e contributed little to the tws deficits r mainly had negative anomalies in september december in eastern china which did not contribute to the tws deficit in july and august the sc region had positive r but meanwhile this region s tws showed no deficit this suggests r also contributed little to the tws deficit we then focus on analyzing the p anomalies and show them in fig 9 it illustrates that significant negative p anomalies happened in eastern china in every month of july to december the large scale severe negative p anomalies first happened in the nc region in july the maximum is 176 1 mm at 32 n 118 e and then migrated south to the yr region in august the maximum is 172 3 mm at 28 n 118 e and spread to almost the whole eastern china in september the maximum is 129 3 mm at 26 n 119 e in october the negative p anomalies shrank and concentrated in northeastern and southeastern china with weakened magnitudes in november the negative p anomalies slightly intensified in the nc yr and sc regions but disappeared in northeastern china followed by weakened negative anomalies in december by comparing figs 6 7 and 9 we observe that the spatiotemporal distribution of negative p anomalies is largely consistent with that of tws sms deficits revealed by grace and lsm indicating that precipitation deficit in the second half of 2019 is the main reason for this drought event to investigate the cause of the precipitation deficit we analyze related meteorological elements since large scale atmospheric circulation system at 500 hpa directly affect local precipitation ding et al 2008 huang et al 2013a huang et al 2013b lu et al 2016 we first calculated anomalies of 500 hpa geopotential height using the same method as we calculate p anomalies which is shown in fig 10 results show that a high pressure ridge with positive anomalies in 500 hpa geopotential height appeared over the west of china in july and august fig 10a and b and then large scale positive anomalies of geopotential height occurred over most areas of eastern china from september to december fig 10c f this positive anomaly of geopotential height together with the subtropical high acted as an atmospheric barrier blocking low pressure disturbances from the upstream westerlies propagating to eastern china and hindering disturbances and water vapor from low latitude oceans transporting to mainland china shiyan 2009 coelho et al 2016 to further explore the atmospheric circulation anomalies that were responsible for the precipitation anomalies we computed anomalies of 500 hpa vertical velocity and 850 hpa horizontal wind and showed them in fig 11 results show that a cyclonic circulation anomaly at 850 hpa occurred over the east china sea in july and maintained over the east china sea and the philippine sea from august to november fig 11a e also there were strong northerly wind anomalies at 850 hpa over eastern china from july to september fig 11a c indicating that warm moist flow was weakly transported from the western tropical pacific to eastern china both the cyclonic circulation anomaly and northerly wind anomaly blocked the water vapor to be brought from the tropical western pacific to eastern china which hampered the confluence of cold and warm air over eastern china huang et al 2012 in addition strong sinking anomalies were observed in 500 hpa vertical velocity over eastern china from july to november shadings in fig 11a e which hindered the precipitation formation and thus caused the precipitation decrease over this region by comparing figs 9 and 11 we find that the spatiotemporal distribution of negative p anomalies agrees well with that of sinking anomalies in december the sinking anomalies over eastern china weaken and occurred sporadically over some local areas so did the negative p anomalies based on the above results we infer that the negative anomaly of precipitation in july december is mainly contributed by the northerly wind anomaly and sinking anomaly over eastern china which are closely related to the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the western pacific huang et al 2012 5 discussion and summary in this study we combine grace derived tws changes and lsm based sms changes to quantify water storage changes during the severe china drought in 2019 to consolidate the quantitative analysis we use the gtch method and the least square method to fuse five grace tws datasets and four lsm sms datasets and generate robust fused data and their uncertainties both the grace and lsm results reveal a severe drought in eastern china from july to december in 2019 results indicate that the water storage deficit initially occurred in july in northeastern and northern china then spread south to south china in august and lasted into december covering a vast area 2 0 106 km2 of eastern china the center of this drought first appeared in northern china then moved southeastward to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and finally stayed in south china grace analysis shows that the largest regional tws deficit was 94 1 17 7 mm which happened in september in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin sms deficits derived from lsms exhibit similar spatiotemporal patterns to grace derived tws deficits with smaller magnitudes mci drought indexes coincide well with grace derived tws and lsm based sms deficits in the spatiotemporal patterns of this drought these three independent indicators together identified and characterized this severe drought event providing us a quantitative understanding of it by analyzing related meteorological elements we find that the precipitation deficit in the second half of 2019 is the main reason for this drought event we attribute the precipitation deficit to the northerly wind anomaly and sinking anomaly over eastern china which are closely associated with the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the western pacific we expect to identify the hydrological signal as robustly as possible in this study without knowing the true value of tws sms any single product is likely to give unreliable results incorporating as many high quality tws sms products as possible is beneficial for improving the reliability of the results and their uncertainties a flat average is not rigorous since it arbitrarily assigns different tws sms products the same weight while the gtch method is the optimal estimation of the noise covariance of different products which provides a statistical base for a rigorous weighted average several previous studies have demonstrated that the gtch method performs better in merging different datasets than a simple average by incorporating and analyzing multiple grace and land surface model data we rigorously quantified the tws and sms changes during the 2019 drought event comparing to the conventional drought monitoring methods that only reflect the degree of drought this method directly assesses the impacts of drought on the terrestrial and soil water storage which is more meaningful for water

4327,an extreme drought on record occurred in eastern china in 2019 and caused severe terrestrial water storage tws deficits it is important to understand this drought process and assess its impacts we combine the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace observations and land surface model lsm outputs to thoroughly investigate this drought event to consolidate the quantitative analysis we fuse five sets of grace derived tws data and four sets of lsm based soil moisture storage sms data respectively using the generalized three cornered hat method and the least square method and thereby generate robust tws and sms results both the grace and lsm results suggest that this drought event started in july in northeastern and northern china and then spread south to southern china in august and lasted until december influencing a vast area of 2 0 106 km2 in eastern china the drought center first appeared in north china then moved southward to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and finally stayed in south china tws results from grace show that the largest regional tws deficit was 94 1 17 7 mm and happened in september in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin sms results from lsms exhibit similar spatiotemporal characteristics to the grace results but with smaller magnitudes meteorological drought composite index from the china meteorological administration agrees well with the grace derived tws deficits and lsm based sms deficits in terms of their spatiotemporal distributions these three independent indicators together identify and assess this severe drought event providing us a quantitative understanding of it the water budget analysis demonstrates that the precipitation deficit in the second half of 2019 is the main reason for this drought event the precipitation deficit is mainly due to the northerly wind anomaly and sinking anomaly over eastern china which are closely associated with the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the western pacific keywords china drought terrestrial water storage grace land surface model precipitation 1 introduction drought is one of the main natural hazards with potentially catastrophic effects on the environment agriculture and economy and also an important scientific issue wilhite 2000 sternberg and troy 2011 wahr and john 2004 grayson 2013 monitoring and quantifying drought induced water storage change is meaningful for understanding drought processes which in turn benefits water resource management especially in the context that population growth and economic development intensify the water resource pressure and climate extremes are expected to occur more frequently cihlar et al 1997 leblanc et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 long et al 2013 thomas et al 2014 however quantifying drought and its hydrological impacts remains a major challenge due to limited large scale comprehensive monitoring means the launch of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites in 2002 provided a new mean to monitor and assess drought event grace observes the earth s time varying gravity field that results from mass redistribution after removal of the contributions of mass transports from the atmosphere the ocean and the earth s interior the gravity variations are mainly due to terrestrial water storage tws changes wahr et al 1998 tws changes derived from grace are the first ever quantification of integrated storage of surface and subsurface water over land wahr and john 2004 syed et al 2008 and have been widely used to monitor the hydrologic variations in response to droughts grace stopped service in july 2017 and its successor grace follow on grace fo started to operate in may 2018 providing us long term gravity field change data many scientists have used grace observations to study drought events yirdaw et al 2008 used grace to investigate the 2003 canadian prairie drought and proposed a drought indicator based on grace estimated tws chen et al 2009 used the non seasonal change of grace estimated tws to detect the 2005 drought in the central amazon basin leblanc et al 2009 assessed the response of water resources and the propagation of the water deficit through the hydrological cycle during the early 21st century multiyear drought in southeast australia using grace data in situ hydrological data and model data long et al 2013 estimated a tws depletion of 62 3 17 7 km3 during the 2011 drought in texas using grace derived tws changes thomas et al 2014 presented a quantitative approach for measuring hydrological drought occurrence and severity based on grace data sinha et al 2017 expanded the work of thomas et al 2014 and devised a drought index to quantify drought intensity and severity using grace estimated tws variations in addition to using grace to directly monitoring drought grace estimated tws has been assimilated into land surface models zaitchik et al 2008 li et al 2012 li et al 2019 and subsequently integrated into the north american drought monitor houborg et al 2012 and a groundwater drought indicator li et al 2019 grace solutions from different organizations have some discrepancies due to different data processing strategies sakumura et al 2014 save et al 2018 dahle et al 2018 yuan 2018 kvas et al 2019 göttl et al 2018 performed an assessment of the rl06 grace data from the center for space research csr at the university of texas the helmholtz centre potsdam german research centre for geosciences gfz and jet propulsion laboratory jpl and found that mass changes and excitation functions derived from the three datasets have certain discrepancies mu et al 2020 analyzed mass changes derived from rl06 level 2 solutions from the above three organizations and showed that mass changes derived from the three grace solutions had different trend patterns in the north china plain the bohai sea and the east china sea and had different annual amplitudes in the bohai sea however most of the existed studies on drought monitoring used single grace solutions which may give unreliable results due to discrepancies among different grace solutions zhang et al 2020 in addition the 2019 china drought has not been thoroughly investigated this motivates us to conduct a comprehensive investigation into this drought event using merged grace solutions and land surface model lsm outputs through this study we expect to 1 robustly quantify tws changes in response to the 2019 china drought using different datasets and 2 explain the meteorological drivers for this drought 2 research area and data 2 1 study region we focus our research area on mainland china where a historic drought happened in 2019 the topography of the research area is displayed in fig 1 this drought event was mainly located in eastern china where the climate system is predominated by the monsoon the climate in eastern china is characterized by heat and humidity in summer and cold and dryness in winter which results from the seasonal alternation between warm moist airflow from the pacific to inland and dry cold airflow from the mainland accordingly precipitation in eastern china varies seasonally with the monsoon and concentrates mostly in summer to facilitate the characterization of the spatiotemporal distribution of the drought we delimit three subregions in eastern china i e the nc region covering most of the north china plain and surrounding areas the yr region covering most of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and surrounding areas and the sc region covering most of south china the boundaries of the three subregions are also presented in fig 1 in this study we combine the grace data the lsm output and a drought index to quantitatively investigate the tws changes in the research area during this drought event 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace data we use the latest release of monthly 1 gridded land water storage data rl06 based on three grace grace fo spherical harmonic sh solutions provided by csr gfz and jpl respectively these water storage data are derived from grace and grace fo time varying gravity observations and expressed in centimeters of equivalent water height ewh landerer and swenson 2012 the three organizations have applied several post processing corrections to their sh solutions to isolate the terrestrial water storage signal the c20 spherical harmonic coefficients have been replaced with the solutions from satellite laser ranging cheng 2011 the degree 1 coefficients geocenter motion have been estimated using the method from swenson et al 2008 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia has been corrected using the model from geruo et al 2013 a destriping filter has been applied to minimize the effects of correlated errors swenson and wahr 2006 to minimize the effects of correlated errors and high frequency errors the spherical harmonic solutions have been smoothed with a 300 km wide gaussian filter to relieve attenuation effects caused by truncating and smoothing the grace tws products are scaled by a set of gain factors based on national center for atmospheric research s community land model v4 0 data oleson et al 2008 landerer and swenson 2012 long et al 2014a long et al 2014b thomas et al 2014 we also use the monthly global tws data derived from two mascon solutions provided by csr and jpl the jpl mascon is the release 6 version 1 with the coastal resolution improvement filter wiese et al 2018 the csr mascon is the release 6 version 2 0 save et al 2016 the c20 degree 2 order 0 coefficients of csr mascon and jpl mascon solutions have been replaced with the solutions from satellite laser ranging according to loomis et al 2019 and cheng 2011 respectively the c30 coefficients have been replaced with the solutions from satellite laser ranging loomis et al 2019 for csr grace fo solutions the degree 1 coefficients geocenter motion of csr and jpl mascon solutions have been estimated using the estimates in tn 13a from landerer 2019 and the methods from sun et al 2016 and swenson et al 2008 the glacial isostatic adjustment gia of the csr and jpl mascon solutions has been corrected using the ice6g d model from richard peltier et al 2018 these two mascon solutions together with the three sh solutions of monthly grace and grace fo tws changes in 2002 2019 are derived and used in this study for convenience the water storage data based on the three sh solutions and the two mascon solutions are termed as csr tws gfz tws jpl tws csr m tws and jpl m tws hereafter 2 2 2 land surface models we use the simulated soil moisture content snow water equivalent and canopy water from four lsms in global land data assimilation system version 1 gldas 1 the four lsms are the clm2 0 model the mosaic model the noah 2 7 model and the vic model their spatial resolution is 1 and temporal resolution is one month the depths of simulated soil moisture content are 3 4 m for clm2 0 3 5 m for mosaic 2 m for noah 2 7 and 1 9 m for vic rodell et al 2004 water storage in the reservoirs is not included in these models we compute the sum of the soil moisture content the snow water equivalent and the canopy water and label the sum as soil moisture storage sms hereafter monthly gridded sms data from 2002 to 2019 based on the four lsms are calculated and utilized in this research 2 2 3 other hydrometeorological data era5 is the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate monthly total precipitation evaporation 2 m temperature runoff 500 hpa geopotential 500 hpa vertical velocity and 850 hpa horizontal wind velocity data from era5 are used the time period is 2002 2019 and their spatial resolution is 1 the ecmwf reanalysis preserves closure of the water balance and it has been proven to perform well in the representation of the hydrological cycle and the quality of precipitation and tropospheric circulation through a comparison with ground based and remote sensing observations dee et al 2011 huang et al 2013a huang et al 2013b huang et al 2015 balsamo et al 2015 hersbach et al 2020 which makes it suitable for this study we also use the monthly meteorological drought composite index mci collected from the china meteorological administration cma national climate center in 2019 from 2400 stations in mainland china to identify the drought and quantify its intensity the mci has been widely used in national and provincial drought monitoring operational systems in china since 2012 this drought index considers the combined effects of recent effective precipitation monthly evapotranspiration and seasonal and near semi annual precipitation it is suitable for the daily dynamic monitoring and assessment of the meteorological drought mci is defined as follows 1 mci k a a s p i w 60 b m i 30 c s p i 90 d s p i 150 where spi w 60 denotes the past 60 days standardized weighted precipitation index which is used as a proxy for effective precipitation m i 30 denotes the past 30 days relative moisture index which is used to quantitatively describe the balance between precipitation and evaporation sp i 90 and sp i 150 are the past 90 days and the past 150 days standardized precipitation index values a b c and d are the weights of the above four indexes whose values are set to 0 3 0 5 0 3 0 2 in northern china and 0 5 0 6 0 2 0 1 in southern china by the cma ka is the seasonal adjustment coefficient provided by the cma which is determined according to the sensitivity of main crops to soil moisture at different growth stages in different seasons and different regions the categorization of the drought grade according to the mci is displayed in table 1 3 fusing different datasets we remove 2005 2010 means from the grace tws and lsm sms time series respectively to ensure they have the same reference period hereafter our analyses will be based on these data since discrepancies usually exist among different datasets one may obtain contradictory results and conclusions when using different single datasets to eliminate the discrepancies induced by data and improve the reliability of the results we will first use a generalized three cornered hat method gtch to estimate the relative uncertainties of the grace tws lsm sms data and then fuse them according to their uncertainties using a least square method 3 1 the generalized three cornered hat method since the uncertainties of the grace tws estimates and the lsm sms estimates are unclear we need to estimate them first here we use the gtch method to estimate the relative covariances for the five grace data and four lsm data respectively the classic three cornered hat method was first introduced by gray and allan 1974 and its generalized version was further developed by premoli and tavella 1993 tavella and premoli 1994 galindo and palacio 1999 and galindo et al 2001 this method can estimate relative covariances of different datasets without a priori knowledge as long as at least three datasets exist long et al 2014a long et al 2014b long et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 it has been proven effective in estimating covariances of grace data and lsm data long et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 technical details about the gtch method can be found in section s1 of the supplementary material sm 3 2 data fusion we applied the gtch method to the tws estimates from five grace datasets to estimate their relative covariances then we fused the five tws estimates by taking a weighted average of them 2 x i 1 n w i x i where x i and w i denotes the tws estimates from the individual grace solution and its corresponding weights the weights are determined based on the estimated variances using eq 3 3 w i 1 r ii n 1 n 1 r nn where r ii is the variance of the ith tws time series estimated by the gtch method here we neglect the correlations between different datasets since the gtch method may not give good estimation for the correlations koot et al 2006 the above processes are performed grid by grid until we obtained all the covariances of the five datasets and fused them on all the grid nodes the same processing is also applied to the four lsm datasets we also obtained their relative uncertainties and fused results on the same grid nodes with the grace data 4 results 4 1 uncertainties of terrestrial water storage change estimates the relative uncertainties i e the square root of the variance estimated by the gtch method for the five grace based tws changes and the four lsm based sms changes are shown in figs 2 and 3 among the five grace tws changes tws change estimates from the three sh solutions show smaller uncertainties than those from the two mascon solutions in mainland china specifically tws change estimates from the three grace sh solutions typically exhibit uncertainties lower than 20 mm in the research area tws change estimates from the two grace mascon solutions show uncertainties greater than 20 mm in most regions especially the uncertainties are higher than 50 mm in some regions of north china plain southeastern china the southern tibetan plateau the eastern kunlun mountains and the western tianshan mountains the uncertainties of the four sms datasets exhibit similar spatial patterns that are characterized by higher uncertainties in southern and eastern china than in northern and western china in northeastern china southern china and tibetan plateau the four sms datasets generally have uncertainties higher than 40 mm especially the uncertainties of mosaic sms are over 100 mm in some regions of southern china the four perform similarly in northwestern china with uncertainties mostly lower than 20 mm we sort the uncertainties from all the grid nodes in the research area in ascending order and take the median one to represent the uncertainty of the whole research area this is done for different grace tws and lsm sms results and the results are presented in table 2 it suggests that the grace tws changes have lower uncertainties average medium 15 7 mm than the lsm sms changes average medium 37 1 mm csr tws generates the lowest uncertainty among the five grace tws results with a medium of 8 4 mm followed by the gfz tws with a medium of 9 1 mm and the jpl tws with a medium of 13 2 mm the tws changes from the two mascon solutions show larger uncertainties than that from the three sh solutions with the mediums of 21 7 mm for the csr m tws and 26 3 mm for the jpl m tws among the four lsm sms changes the clm sms exhibits the lowest uncertainty with a medium of 27 5 mm followed by the noah sms with a medium of 33 2 mm the vic sms with a medium of 43 6 mm and the mosaic sms with a medium of 43 9 mm based on the variances estimated by the gtch method we fuse the five grace tws estimates and four lsm sms estimates respectively to yield the fused results fig s1 shows the tws changes estimated from the five individual grace data for july december 2019 while fig 4 shows the fused estimates fig s2 shows the sms changes estimated from the four individual lsm sms estimates while fig 5 shows the fused estimates among the five grace tws estimates tws estimates from the three sh solutions exhibit similar magnitudes while that from the two mascon solutions show relatively large magnitudes fig s1 comparing fig 3 and fig s1 it s observed that the fused tws estimates exhibit similar magnitudes to the tws estimates from the three sh solutions this is expected since the three sh solutions have smaller uncertainties and thus have larger weights in data fusing than the two mascon solutions fig 2 and table 2 the five grace tws estimates and the fused estimates agree well in their spatiotemporal patterns meanwhile the four lsm sms estimates and the fused sms estimates show significant discrepancies in magnitudes but have similar spatiotemporal patterns the magnitudes of clm sms estimates are much smaller than those of the other three sms estimates the mosaic sms estimates exhibit the greatest magnitudes the fused sms estimates exhibit moderate magnitudes that lie in the middle of the four sms estimates we use the maximum differences between the fused tws estimates and the five individual grace tws estimates as the final uncertainties of the fused tws hereafter this also applies to the fused sms estimates in this way we give a natural confidence interval of 100 for the fused tws and sms estimates the uncertainties of the fused tws and sms estimates for july december 2019 are displayed in figs 4 and 5 respectively the fused tws estimates typically show larger uncertainties in some regions of north china plain southeastern china the southern tibetan plateau the eastern kunlun mountains and the western tianshan mountains for the fused sms spatial distribution patterns of its uncertainties are basically characterized by higher uncertainties in southern and eastern china than in northern and western china 4 2 estimating tws sms anomalies in average cases the tws and sms are mainly characterized by seasonal variations and or long term trends accompanied by some irregular fluctuations including errors we use eq 4 to describe the average states of the tws and sms s temporal variations 4 s t a 0 a 1 t t 0 b 1 cos 2 π t b 2 sin 2 π t c 1 cos 4 π t c 2 sin 4 π t where t denotes time in years t0 is the start time of the time series a0 a1 b1 b2 c1 and c2 are the coefficients to be determined what is different from previous studies e g thomas et al 2014 is that we take the linear trend into account since linear trends in tws sms temporal changes exist in some regions in china rodell et al 2018 gerdener et al 2020 we use eq 4 to fit and remove the long term trend and the seasonal variations from the tws sms time series grid by grid the residual time series depict the deviations from the normal state and are treated as anomalies using eq 4 we estimate the monthly tws anomalies and their uncertainties which are shown in fig 6 it shows that significant tws deficits first appeared in northeastern and northern china in july and then spread south to southern china in august since then the tws deficit covered most of eastern china and lasted into december the tws deficit peaked in september and then slightly alleviated given its magnitude and covering extent we take the maximum regional tws deficit as the tws deficit center fig 6 suggests that the center of the tws deficit migrated from north china southward to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and finally to south china it should be noted that yunnan province and northwestern china also experienced tws deficit during the same period but their temporal patterns are not similar to that in eastern china they may have different drivers in this study we focus on the tws deficit in eastern china to quantitatively understand the intensity and the spatiotemporal variations of the tws deficits we divide the region of interest into three subregions as outlined in fig 1 we calculate monthly regional average tws anomalies in ewh and regional volume water storage anomalies in cubic kilometers which are displayed in table 3 the nc region first experienced the tws deficit in july with a mean negative tws change of 33 13 7 mm and then the deficit increased to a peak of 75 6 4 9 mm in september after that the deficit turned to decrease till december reaching a magnitude of 35 12 9 mm the yr region showed a similar pattern to the nc region till september but after that the tws deficit decreased first and then followed by an increasing trend to december and the maximum tws deficit appeared in september with a magnitude of 94 1 17 7 mm the sc region presented different patterns from the nc region or the yr region it had positive tws anomalies in july and started to show small tws deficits in august and september and after that the tws deficit presented an increasing trend and reached a maximum in december with a magnitude of 85 2 19 8 mm this indicates that the tws deficit started earlier in northern and central china than in southern china the nc yr and sc regions lost huge water with peak magnitudes of 70 4 4 6 km3 67 6 12 7 km3 and 27 9 6 5 km3 respectively during the six months the maximum water deficit of the whole research area reached 143 8 17 km3 equivalent to the capacity of 3 7 three gorges reservoirs all the above suggest that a severe drought happened in the second half of 2019 and caused great tws deficits in a vast area of eastern china since the soil moisture content is an important component of the tws and directly reflects the drought condition we further investigate the sms anomalies during this drought event the monthly sms anomalies derived from the fused lsm data are computed and shown in fig 7 similar to the tws deficits large scale negative sms anomalies are observed in northeastern and northern china in july in august the negative sms anomalies migrated south to the yr region meanwhile most of the sms anomalies in northeastern and northern china turned positive in september most of the nc region and nearly the whole yr region had negative sms anomalies the sms deficit further spread south to the sc region in october covering almost the whole eastern china the sms deficit slightly alleviated in november and then lasted into december the center of negative sms anomalies first appeared in north china and then moved southward to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin the spatial patterns of sms anomalies in eastern china are largely consistent with those of grace tws anomalies which consolidates the characterization of the spatiotemporal distribution of water storage deficits we spatially integrated gridded sms anomalies within each subregion to obtain the regional total sms anomalies in km3 in three subregions as well as calculating regional average sms anomalies in mm which are displayed in table 4 sms in the nc region first showed a negative anomaly in july with a mean deficit of 22 4 17 2 mm changed to a weak positive anomaly 0 9 13 1 mm in august and then turned to a significant negative anomaly 25 8 20 0 mm in september after that this sms deficit increased and peaked in october with a magnitude of 25 9 19 9 mm 24 1 18 5 km3 and followed by a decreasing trend to december the yr region first experienced surplus sms with a positive anomaly of 32 3 78 0 mm in july after that this region experienced five months of sms deficit until december its sms deficit increased first to a peak deficit of 80 4 53 1 mm 56 8 37 6 km3 in october and then decreased sms in the sc region exhibited positive anomalies from july to september and then in october turned to a negative anomaly which intensified from october to december and finally got a peak magnitude of 64 7 39 0 mm 19 0 11 5 km3 the regional sms anomalies displayed similar spatiotemporal behaviors with the regional tws anomalies in the three subregions in july december 2019 they together reveal the process of this severe drought event although lsm based sms anomalies exhibited similar spatiotemporal patterns to the grace derived tws anomalies we cannot neglect the discrepancies between them sms deficits tended to be smaller than tws deficits this is attributed to the fact that sms is only a component of tws and does not count the water storage changes in the reservoirs and underground it is also observed that the sms in the nc region exhibited some positive anomalies in august meanwhile the tws showed negative anomalies we infer that human activities e g groundwater fed irrigation water projects such as reservoir impounding and south to north water diversion induced this divergence between sms changes and tws changes long et al 2017 4 3 comparing water storage deficits with cma drought index fig 8 displays monthly mci drought indexes from nearly 2400 stations in china for the period of july december 2019 results show that the mci identified meteorological drought initially occurred in the nc region in july most of the nc region was characterized by a drought grade of d2 and a few by d3 in august the drought spread south to the northern yr region while the drought in the nc region was alleviated in september the drought spread more southern with more areas becoming severe drought d3 in october the drought intensified in the yr region especially in jiangxi province where d4 drought occurred meanwhile the drought spread more southern covering the whole sc region in contrast the drought in most of the nc region largely eased in november the drought in the sc region developed further with higher levels while drought in the yr region eased slightly in december the drought in the yr and nc regions was largely relieved and the drought was mainly located in the sc region and measured as the d3 drought in general this drought event had a distinct feature that the drought center initiated in northern china and migrated southward the mci agrees well with the grace tws and the lsm sms deficits in identifying this drought event and characterizing its spatiotemporal patterns these three indicators together identify this severe drought event and reveal its evolution process however some discrepancies are also observed for instance the mci identified drought in the nc region was alleviated in august but the magnitude of the tws deficit remained almost the same as in july and similar discrepancies were also observed in the nc and sc regions in december this is because mci assesses the meteorological drought depending on precipitation and evapotranspiration while the grace tws measures the vertically integrated water storage according to the water balance principle the deficit in the tws over a particular region is more likely to be compensated by greater than normal net precipitation precipitation minus evaporation and unlikely recovered under ongoing meteorological drought comparing figs 7 and 8 it is observed that sms anomalies agree better with mci in characterizing spatiotemporal variations of this drought than tws anomalies for instance the sms anomalies and mci both show the water deficit or drought in the nc region was largely relieved in august but the tws anomalies don t and the sms anomalies and mci both show that the sc region first experienced the drought in october while the tws anomalies showed this region first experienced the drought in august the rationale behind this is that sms has a more quick and direct response to precipitation and evapotranspiration than the tws the response of tws to meteorological drought generally delays as it needs time to propagate from the shallow surface to the deep underground mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 4 4 reasons for the drought event according to the water balance principle tws change is the result of subtracting runoff r and evapotranspiration e from precipitation p which can be expressed as 5 ds p e r where ds is the tws change here we investigate how p r and e contributed to the tws deficits in this drought event the 1 gridded monthly total p e and r for the period of 2002 2019 are collected from era5 for each grid node we compute the p e and r anomalies by removing their 2002 2019 mean for each month of july december for instance the p anomalies in july 2019 are the result of removing the july means of 2002 2019 from the p in july 2019 figs s3 and s4 of the supplementary material show the monthly anomalies of e and r from july to december in 2019 it demonstrates that e exhibited weak anomalies 40 5 39 1 mm in july december 2019 and its spatiotemporal patterns are inconsistent with the tws deficits implying e contributed little to the tws deficits r mainly had negative anomalies in september december in eastern china which did not contribute to the tws deficit in july and august the sc region had positive r but meanwhile this region s tws showed no deficit this suggests r also contributed little to the tws deficit we then focus on analyzing the p anomalies and show them in fig 9 it illustrates that significant negative p anomalies happened in eastern china in every month of july to december the large scale severe negative p anomalies first happened in the nc region in july the maximum is 176 1 mm at 32 n 118 e and then migrated south to the yr region in august the maximum is 172 3 mm at 28 n 118 e and spread to almost the whole eastern china in september the maximum is 129 3 mm at 26 n 119 e in october the negative p anomalies shrank and concentrated in northeastern and southeastern china with weakened magnitudes in november the negative p anomalies slightly intensified in the nc yr and sc regions but disappeared in northeastern china followed by weakened negative anomalies in december by comparing figs 6 7 and 9 we observe that the spatiotemporal distribution of negative p anomalies is largely consistent with that of tws sms deficits revealed by grace and lsm indicating that precipitation deficit in the second half of 2019 is the main reason for this drought event to investigate the cause of the precipitation deficit we analyze related meteorological elements since large scale atmospheric circulation system at 500 hpa directly affect local precipitation ding et al 2008 huang et al 2013a huang et al 2013b lu et al 2016 we first calculated anomalies of 500 hpa geopotential height using the same method as we calculate p anomalies which is shown in fig 10 results show that a high pressure ridge with positive anomalies in 500 hpa geopotential height appeared over the west of china in july and august fig 10a and b and then large scale positive anomalies of geopotential height occurred over most areas of eastern china from september to december fig 10c f this positive anomaly of geopotential height together with the subtropical high acted as an atmospheric barrier blocking low pressure disturbances from the upstream westerlies propagating to eastern china and hindering disturbances and water vapor from low latitude oceans transporting to mainland china shiyan 2009 coelho et al 2016 to further explore the atmospheric circulation anomalies that were responsible for the precipitation anomalies we computed anomalies of 500 hpa vertical velocity and 850 hpa horizontal wind and showed them in fig 11 results show that a cyclonic circulation anomaly at 850 hpa occurred over the east china sea in july and maintained over the east china sea and the philippine sea from august to november fig 11a e also there were strong northerly wind anomalies at 850 hpa over eastern china from july to september fig 11a c indicating that warm moist flow was weakly transported from the western tropical pacific to eastern china both the cyclonic circulation anomaly and northerly wind anomaly blocked the water vapor to be brought from the tropical western pacific to eastern china which hampered the confluence of cold and warm air over eastern china huang et al 2012 in addition strong sinking anomalies were observed in 500 hpa vertical velocity over eastern china from july to november shadings in fig 11a e which hindered the precipitation formation and thus caused the precipitation decrease over this region by comparing figs 9 and 11 we find that the spatiotemporal distribution of negative p anomalies agrees well with that of sinking anomalies in december the sinking anomalies over eastern china weaken and occurred sporadically over some local areas so did the negative p anomalies based on the above results we infer that the negative anomaly of precipitation in july december is mainly contributed by the northerly wind anomaly and sinking anomaly over eastern china which are closely related to the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the western pacific huang et al 2012 5 discussion and summary in this study we combine grace derived tws changes and lsm based sms changes to quantify water storage changes during the severe china drought in 2019 to consolidate the quantitative analysis we use the gtch method and the least square method to fuse five grace tws datasets and four lsm sms datasets and generate robust fused data and their uncertainties both the grace and lsm results reveal a severe drought in eastern china from july to december in 2019 results indicate that the water storage deficit initially occurred in july in northeastern and northern china then spread south to south china in august and lasted into december covering a vast area 2 0 106 km2 of eastern china the center of this drought first appeared in northern china then moved southeastward to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and finally stayed in south china grace analysis shows that the largest regional tws deficit was 94 1 17 7 mm which happened in september in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin sms deficits derived from lsms exhibit similar spatiotemporal patterns to grace derived tws deficits with smaller magnitudes mci drought indexes coincide well with grace derived tws and lsm based sms deficits in the spatiotemporal patterns of this drought these three independent indicators together identified and characterized this severe drought event providing us a quantitative understanding of it by analyzing related meteorological elements we find that the precipitation deficit in the second half of 2019 is the main reason for this drought event we attribute the precipitation deficit to the northerly wind anomaly and sinking anomaly over eastern china which are closely associated with the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the western pacific we expect to identify the hydrological signal as robustly as possible in this study without knowing the true value of tws sms any single product is likely to give unreliable results incorporating as many high quality tws sms products as possible is beneficial for improving the reliability of the results and their uncertainties a flat average is not rigorous since it arbitrarily assigns different tws sms products the same weight while the gtch method is the optimal estimation of the noise covariance of different products which provides a statistical base for a rigorous weighted average several previous studies have demonstrated that the gtch method performs better in merging different datasets than a simple average by incorporating and analyzing multiple grace and land surface model data we rigorously quantified the tws and sms changes during the 2019 drought event comparing to the conventional drought monitoring methods that only reflect the degree of drought this method directly assesses the impacts of drought on the terrestrial and soil water storage which is more meaningful for water

4328,the past few decades have witnessed an intensification of extreme precipitation ep events triggered by atmospheric rivers ars leading to massive flooding highlighting the importance of studying the physical mechanisms associated with these types of events this study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of ars and related extreme precipitation ar ep events and the cascading effect of the synoptic scale meteorological patterns on underlying processes in the coastal states of the southeastern united states sues during the 1979 2019 period the seasonal frequency of ep events associated with ars suggests that more frequent ar ep events occur during the colder months november to april in contrast the ar ep events are less frequent but more severe in the warmer months may to october a total of 12 15 ar ep events with severity exceeding the 99th percentile precipitation threshold were observed during the 3 month overlapping seasons between november and april from 1979 to 2019 that affected georgia florida alabama and south carolina on the other hand the average precipitation magnitude of the ar ep events is relatively higher 55 90 mm day in the warmer months may to october to explore the cascading nature of relevant meteorological forcing on the physical processes that favor such events we performed an event centered composite analysis based on the top 100 severe ar ep events observed during the extended cold and warm season separately it was observed that during the progression of the ar ep events the anomalies associated with composite mean sea level pressure mslp and 850mb geopotential height z850 make a transition from the trough to ridge formation along with a south eastward extension of bermuda high in the cold season the spatiotemporal evolution of these meteorological variables is found to have a cascading effect on the mode of moisture transport indicated by integrated vapor transport ivt and moisture availability shown by total column water vapor associated with the major ar ep events the warm season ivt field gets stronger 2 days before the ar ep event occurrences indicating a continuous increase in moisture influx into the gulf and atlantic coastal plains similar strengthening of ivt is noted over the gulf coastal plains during the cold season a cascading effect is also noted for the moisture availability indicated by a significant increase in total column water vapor tcwv over the gulf of mexico 2 days before the events overall the cold season ar eps are driven by relatively stronger dynamical systems indicated by greater ivt intensity in contrast the warm season ar eps are associated with a weaker ivt field higher atmospheric instability and more moist conditions keywords atmospheric rivers coastal seus extreme precipitation cascading effect synoptic patterns moisture advection 1 introduction recently extreme precipitation events leading to massive floods have intensified in intensity duration and frequency in different parts of the world madsen et al 2014 mishra and singh 2010 papalexiou and montanari 2019 vu and mishra 2019 much of this intensification is attributed to the acceleration of the hydrologic cycle caused by climate change schumacher and rasmussen 2020 vu and mishra 2019 wang et al 2013 wen et al 2020 a considerable proportion of which is associated with large scale atmospheric features such as atmospheric rivers ars payne et al 2020 extreme precipitation and flooding associated with ars have been reported in various parts of the globe kamae et al 2017 lavers et al 2012 lavers and villarini 2013a paltan et al 2017 ramos et al 2015 waliser and guan 2017 including the us barth et al 2017 debbage et al 2017 mahoney et al 2016 moore et al 2011 ralph et al 2017 ralph and dettinger 2011 ars are long narrow corridors of strong poleward water vapor transport across the mid latitudes neiman et al 2008b newell et al 1992 zhu and newell 1998 they can be associated with the warm conveyor belt of extratropical cyclones and are often characterized by strong low level winds ars are also responsible for approximately 90 of all pole ward atmospheric water vapor transport across the mid latitudes guan and waliser 2015 zhu and newell 1998 ars have a varied extent of societal and eco hydrological impacts which range from beneficial to devastating for example ars are one of the major contributors to the snowpack and freshwater resources in the arid portions of the southwestern us and responsible for 20 50 of the region s rainfall accumulation dettinger et al 2011 ars have been associated with 30 to 60 of the annual variability of total runoff thereby impacting the seasonal availability of water resources in the west coast of the us chen et al 2019 landfalling ar storms are also recognized as potential drought busters in the pacific northwest by overcoming nearly 60 70 of all persistent droughts in the region dettinger 2013 ars are even known for causing megafloods often dubbed as arkstorms these events impact thousands of square miles of urban and agricultural land across the us disrupting millions of lives and causing massive economic damages porter et al 2011 so far more than 99 of all reported flood damages in the western us have been attributed to severe landfalling ar storms corringham et al 2019 however the impact of ars is not limited to the west coast of the us in the southeastern us the major historical 1000 year flood event that occurred on may 1 2 2010 has been attributed to ars moore et al 2011 which affected significant parts of tennessee kentucky and mississippi this specific series of ars resulted in sustained precipitation for 48 h as high as 344 7 mm over nashville tennessee leading to flash flooding that resulted in 26 fatalities and caused 2 3 billion of property damages moore et al 2011 recognizing the potential socio economic damages e g agricultural and devastating flood damages caused by the ars in the seus there has been a growing concern on the ar activities along the coastal southeast us seus gimeno et al 2014 many studies highlighted the possible association between major flood events in the central and southeastern us with strong water vapor transport into the seus from multiple moisture sources such as the caribbean sea the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean dirmeyer and kinter 2010 2009 guan and waliser 2015 lavers and villarini 2013b moore et al 2011 pfahl et al 2013 an enhanced source of moisture originating in the caribbean and the gulf of mexico can trigger large scale flood events in the mid western us during may july dirmeyer and kinter 2010 the study detected a narrow fetch of moisture steering along the coast of central america extending from the yucatan peninsula and moving all the way upwards to the western gulf of mexico where it connects with the great plains low level jet gpllj a phenomena dubbed maya express dirmeyer and kinter 2009 further lavers and villarini 2013b highlighted that much of the annual maxima floods from 1105 basins across the central us and reported that in 42 5 of the basins more than half of the flood events are associated with ars interacting with the seus the major flooding event in the ohio river valley may 1 2 2010 was triggered by the ars that originated from the eastern tropical pacific and the caribbean sea moore et al 2011 these studies highlighted the significant role of ars in causing major flood events more recently global guan and waliser 2015 and regional studies debbage et al 2017 mahoney et al 2016 miller et al 2017 rabinowitz et al 2019 have provided crucial information on the climatological and synoptic aspects of ars affecting the seus more than 10 of ar landfalls along the gulf of mexico and gulf stream contributed to more than 30 of the annual precipitation over most parts of the southeastern us guan and waliser 2015 during the period 1980 2010 nearly 41 of the heavy precipitation events 100 mm day and 52 of the spatially widespread heavy precipitation events affecting 7000 km2 area in the southeastern us were associated with ars mahoney et al 2016 focusing on persistent ar events with a duration of at least 48 h debbage et al 2017 reported that total 40 persistent ar events per year occurred along the seus coastline locations between 1979 and 2014 the study also highlights the potential role of great plains jet gpj and caribbean low level jet cllj on the seus ars which happens to interact with the western gulf of mexico miller et al 2017 investigated the synoptic patterns associated with minor major flood events in the pigeon river basin located downstream of the southern appalachian mountains over 5 years period the synoptic patterns were found to reveal the role of a highly amplified slow moving positively tilted trough formation that favored the ar ep events over the region rabinowitz et al 2019 selected 15 ar events between 2000 and 2015 across the mississippi river valley and categorized their associated synoptic patterns as progressive troughs multiple studies have highlighted the potential role of persistent atmospheric anomalies and structure of moisture transport for a better understanding of the behavior of ar ep events dirmeyer and kinter 2010 moore et al 2011 rabinowitz et al 2019 steinschneider et al 2018 zhu and newell 1998 more specifically based on the available moisture sources and transport mechanism it is possible to generate information related to the atmospheric conditions that are particularly moist and unstable at the same time these synoptic conditions progressively intensify with time triggering a sequence of favorable conditions for moisture transport and advection until they finally lead to the occurrence of heavy precipitation events in such a context cascading effects have been increasingly investigated to understand the sequence of interconnected processes that ultimately lead to extreme precipitation events the cascading effects can be examined based on the evolution of meteorological features and moisture influx associated with the days before the ar ep events while previous studies explored the role of ars in driving ep events over the seus the potential influence of atmospheric anomalies on such processes was partly explored debbage et al 2017 mahoney et al 2016 furthermore investigating the influence of atmospheric anomalies only for coastal interactions debbage et al 2017 limits our understanding of such processes driving ep events across the seus region this study begins with determining the variation of ep events with respect to ar events in the next step the synoptic feature s space time evolution is investigated to understand its cascading effect on the moisture transport that influenced the 100 most severe ar ep events during the cold and warm season separately more specifically the primary objective of this study is to address the following questions 1 how are the ar events and ar ep events distributed spatially and across different seasons in eight seus states florida alabama mississippi louisiana georgia north carolina south carolina and texas 2 is there a cascading effect of synoptic scale meteorological forcing on the moisture availability and mode of advection associated with major ar ep events observed in the region between 1979 and 2019 the rest of the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 focuses on the data and methodology applied in the study the results and relevant discussions are provided in section 3 and finally the summary of major findings and concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 data ar events are identified within the region bounded by latitudes 15 n to 45 n and longitudes 110 w to 55 w hereafter referred to as the ar detection region detection of ars is performed by using specific humidity and zonal and meridional wind fields for 20 pressure levels between 1000 and 300 hpa inclusive retrieved at 6 hourly time steps for the period 1979 2019 from the high resolution european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis 5 era5 0 25 x 0 25 grid resolution the hurricane track data from 1979 to 2019 is obtained from the atlantic hurricane database hurdat2 to segregate the ars from the tropical cyclones tcs the hurdat2 is available at 6 hourly intervals provided by the national hurricane center available at https www nhc noaa gov data tcr mean sea level pressure mslp and 850 mbar geopotential height z850 are selected to study the synoptic patterns and their cascading effect on the moisture transport mechanisms as such 6 hourly z850 total column water vapor tcwv and mslp data were obtained from the era 5 at the native spatial resolution for the 1979 2019 period while mslp and z850 are extensively used to define the large scale meteorological patterns that have a primary influence on extreme precipitation events barlow et al 2019 tcwv is an essential component to assess the moisture availability associated with ar eps gimeno et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 the impact of ars on the precipitation and ep events are studied for the seus region that includes the eight coastal states namely alabama al georgia ga louisiana la mississippi ms north carolina nc south carolina sc texas tx and florida fl the ep events are derived based on the daily observed precipitation dataset 1979 2019 obtained from the climate prediction center cpc https www esrl noaa gov psd available at 0 5 horizontal grid resolution the daily precipitation dataset provided by noaa s cpc is produced from global unified gauge based analysis from over 30 000 stations with a daily time step chen et al 2008 the cpc data has been validated against historical records and measurements at nearby stations concurrent radar satellite observations and numerical model forecasts to maintain consistency in spatial resolution across all datasets used in the study we apply the synergraphic mapping system symap maurer et al 2002 to regrid the reanalysis dataset at the 0 5 cpc precipitation grid resolution reanalysis data available at 0 5 x0 5 is reasonable to capture the ars and their potential influence on the ep events payne et al 2020 and multiple studies investigated regional ar behavior at the same or coarser resolution debbage et al 2017 guan and waliser 2015 lavers and villarini 2013b 2013a mahoney et al 2016 paltan et al 2017 2 2 ar detection methodology ars are derived based on an ar detection algorithm guan and waliser 2015 that incorporates the characteristics of vertically integrated vapor transport ivt within the lower troposphere at 6 hourly time steps the ivt measures the integrated moisture flux based on specific humidity and zonal and meridional wind characteristics considering the dual drivers of ar behavior integrated water vapor and wind the ivt magnitude or intensity is increasingly used to diagnose ars across various parts of the globe guan and waliser 2015 mundhenk et al 2016 rabinowitz et al 2019 shields et al 2018b waliser and guan 2017 the ivt intensity is calculated in a eulerian framework by performing a mass weighted vertical integration within the pressure levels ranging from 1000 to 300 hpa as follows 1 ivt 1 g 1000 300 qudp 2 1 g 1000 300 qvdp 2 where g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s 2 q is specific humidity kg kg 1 u is zonal wind m s v is meridional wind m s and dp is the pressure difference pa between adjacent pressure levels the algorithm has been applied in many recent studies related to ars debbage et al 2017 huning et al 2019 kim et al 2018 waliser and guan 2017 the reader is referred to guan and waliser 2015 for a detailed discussion on the ar detection algorithm the underlying motivation sensitivity analysis and its application a brief discussion on the ar detection procedure is summarized in appendix a1 of the supplementary material it is important to note that at any time step one or more ar landfalls may be detected provided all the requirements see appendix a1 of the supplementary material are fulfilled the algorithm detected a total of 14 992 landfalling ars in the ar detection region which is 25 03 of the total 59 900 six hourly time steps during the study period 1979 2019 2 3 ar event and ar ep event identification the impact of the ars on the ep events is investigated for the grid cells 0 5 x0 5 located within the eight seus states tropical cyclones are seldom identified as a common source of heavy rainfall in the southeastern united states knight and davis 2009 mahoney et al 2016 to assess the contribution from ars alone we removed the effect of tropical cyclones tc from the analysis of ar ep events this is achieved by removing the ar days that coincide with the tc dates out of the detected landfalling ars we found 12 645 ars occurring over at least one grid cell during the 1979 2019 period within or on the seus region boundary ar duration is an important variable that controls precipitation magnitudes ralph et al 2013 an ar event is identified based on the duration of ars that occurred for three or more time steps 18 h or more lavers and villarini 2013a ralph et al 2013 and these ar events can generate extreme precipitation events lavers and villarini 2013a ralph et al 2019 2013 a similar methodology was used to examine the association between ar and extreme precipitation storms for the us s west coast lamjiri et al 2017 ralph et al 2019 and europe lavers and villarini 2013a the ar events are identified based on all the 12 645 landfalling ars two ars were considered independent distinct events if they were separated by more than 1 day extreme precipitation events are determined by applying the peak over threshold method mishra and singh 2010 mondal et al 2020 for the seus grid locations the daily extreme precipitation events are first identified based on the 95th ep95p and 99th ep99p percentile threshold separately these percentiles are calculated for all non zero daily precipitation totals observed during the whole time period 1979 2019 finally an ar ep event is defined as the extreme precipitation event observed during or one day after an ar event this concept of ar events facilitates the association with the daily precipitation data and have been extensively used in previous studies e g guan et al 2010 huning et al 2019 lavers and villarini 2013a 2013b neiman et al 2008a it should be noted that throughout the manuscript the ar ep events evaluated based on the 95th 99th percentile threshold are referred to as ar ep95p ar ep99p 2 4 composite analysis an event centered composite analysis is performed to examine the evolution of the synoptic meteorological features and moisture availability and advection so far event centered composite analysis has been extensively used in numerous studies to explore the relevant synoptic scale meteorological features associated with a specific meteorological event barlow et al 2019 the event centered composite analysis is performed based on the top 100 severe ar ep99p events selected separately for the extended warm may october and cold november april seasons firstly the ar ep99p time series for individual grids across the seus region for a given season warm and cold are selected to form a matrix with the dates and the corresponding ar ep magnitude representing the columns of the matrix the daily ar ep magnitudes are then arranged in a decreasing order to identify the top 100 ar ep events with unique dates for the composite analysis the selected event days are used to obtain the seasonal anomalies in composites of meteorological variables at zero day 2 day and 5 day lags this approach is useful for exploring the sequence of interconnected processes cascading effect driving the top 100 severe ar ep events more specifically seasonal anomalies in the daily mean composites of the meteorological variables mslp z850 and tcwv are calculated at every grid location by subtracting the mean of daily values coinciding with the time of occurrence of the selected top 100 ar ep events from the long term mean for the 1979 2019 period furthermore a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test ks test is performed to determine the statistical significance at 95 confidence level of the anomalies at every grid location to determine the moisture advection into the region we calculate the composite mean of the daily ivt field during which the top 100 ar ep events are observed for every grid location finally to assess their temporal evolution over time each of these composite and composite anomalies are also calculated for 5 days and 2 days prior to the occurrence of the top 100 ar ep events a similar approach has been adopted by ridder et al 2018 to investigate the temporal evolution of atmospheric conditions associated with ar influenced ep along the dutch coast 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of ep and ar events in seus ep events generally affect a varied range of areas smaller to larger across the seus throughout the year moore et al 2015 to understand the spatial patterns associated with ep and ar events in the seus we constructed spatial maps showing the number of ep95p ep99p and only ar after removing the tcs events fig 1 a c and e depicts the spatial distribution of the annual event counts of ep95p ep99p and ar respectively for the 1979 2019 period the results are further summarized as boxplots based on the eight seus states shown in fig 1 b d and f fig 1 a d show that except for texas all other states are affected by 11 16 2 5 ep95p ep99p events per year a homogenous spatial pattern is noted for the ep95p event counts across most parts of the seus region eastward of texas the ep99p event counts however vary considerably across the seus with a higher number of events clustered in the eastern gulf coastal plains and the western part of the florida peninsula this is also indicated by the boxplots in fig 1 d that show a comparatively greater 3 5 number of ep99p events per year observed over georgia florida alabama and south carolina fig 1 e f shows that the rate of ar activities is found to be relatively higher along the atlantic coastal plain of the seus more than 12 ar events are observed per year over the southeastern appalachian range extending southwards along the atlantic coastal plain up to the southern tip of the florida peninsula this spatial distribution is mirrored by the boxplots depicted for the eight seus states as shown in fig 4 f a relatively greater 12 15 number of ar events per year affects the easternmost states including larger portions of south carolina florida north carolina and georgia furthermore the spatial distribution of ar event counts closely matches the spatial pattern exhibited by the ep95p events especially along the eastern coast of nc sc georgia and florida located along the east side of the appalachian range interestingly the regions showing a higher frequency of ar events are found to be located along the trajectory of the sub tropical low level jet streams sllj attributed to the atlantic warm pool wang and lee 2007 the sllj represents a persistent air mass influx into the subtropics and possibly supplies a significant share of moisture into the region combined with ars that typically act along the cllj or westerlies in the region this favors the influx of moisture into this region resulting in most ar activities along the coast of atlantic coastal plains 3 2 ar ep characteristics in seus ars have been typically associated with ep events across different parts of the globe dettinger 2011 gimeno et al 2014 guirguis et al 2019 mahoney et al 2016 moore et al 2011 rutz et al 2013 tsuji and takayabu 2019 valenzuela and garreaud 2019 the pronounced temporal and location dependent behavior exhibited by the number of ar event occurrences as seen earlier is likely to be reflected in the ep occurrences driven by the ars which is the focus of this analysis as such using daily observations of precipitation accumulation from cpc the ar ep events are identified at every grid point based on a peak over threshold approach as discussed in section 2 4 figure s1 shows the geographical distribution of 95th and 99th percentile thresholds based on which the peak over threshold methodology is applied to the daily precipitation totals in this section we explore mainly two characteristics of ar ep events the spatial distribution of the frequency per year of the ar ep events and the seasonal variation of the frequency and the average magnitude of these events across the seus region the annual frequency of ar ep events is examined at each grid point to identify any location dependent behavior revealed by the observed ar ep events during the selected period fig 2 a d shows the spatial distribution of the annual frequency of ar ep95 and ar ep99 events for the seus region and eight states for the 1979 2019 period in addition to that we also examine the precipitation characteristics spatial distribution and magnitude across the seus region for selected ars observed during 3rd and 4th may 2010 due to their association with large scale flooding mahoney et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 e f the seasonal variations of the total ar ep event count and average magnitudes for the 1979 2019 period are depicted by heatmaps as shown in fig 3 the seasonal variations are supposed to reveal any temporal dependence exhibited by ar driven ep events and their severity in the seus and including states as shown in fig 2 a b the spatial patterns depicted by the annual frequency of ar ep events are also in close agreement with that obtained for the ep and ar events fig 1 about 3 5 ar ep99p and at least 1 2 ar ep99p events per year are found to occur in the eastern part of the seus region with the greatest number of events occurring primarily in the sub tropical region along the northwestern coast of the florida peninsula and south of georgia the higher rate of ar ep events in these regions is also reminiscent of the fact that about 90 of the total water vapor flux is attributed to ars located within the sub tropics ralph et al 2004 zhu and newell 1998 these results are further reflected by the boxplots that show the greatest number of ar ep events occurred in florida and georgia fig 2 c d these results are concordant with the spatial pattern exhibited by the ep99p event counts for these regions fig 1 d fig 2 e f shows the spatial pattern and severity of the ar ep events that cause extreme socio economic damages in the past we selected two consecutive ars observed on 3rd and 4th may 2010 it can be noted that these ars are associated with a daily precipitation total of more than 100 mm observed across the junction between the gulf and atlantic coastal plain of the seus fig 2 f previous studies have reported these ars were associated with major historic flooding in the seus mahoney et al 2016 moore et al 2011 to explore the temporal dynamics of the ar ep event characteristics we examine the seasonal variation of the total event counts and average precipitation magnitude for the seus region and the eight including states for the 1979 2019 period the seasonal variation of total ar ep event counts and average precipitation magnitude are examined based on the seasons defined by a 3 month overlapping windows for all 12 months the 3 month overlap allows for scaling the seasons to represent uniform 90 day seasons based on this criterion we obtained the regional averages of seasonal counts of ar ep95p and ar ep99p events and the corresponding average precipitation magnitudes as illustrated by the heatmaps in fig 3 a b and fig 3 c d respectively a marked cold season dependence is noticeable in the total ar ep event occurrences a greater number of events is noted over georgia florida alabama and south carolina during the october november december ond november december january ndj december january february djf january february march jfm february march april fma and march april may mam season fig 3 a and c these regions show a total of more than 50 ar ep95p and 12 15 ar ep99p events in each overlapping season between november and april during the 41 year period 1979 2019 only a few ar ep events less than 5 10 events are found to occur during the extended warm season months april may june amj to september october november son over the entire seus region these findings are in close agreement with previous studies that suggest the possible contribution of ars to more frequent rainfall events in the seus with a greater influence observed predominantly during the cold season debbage et al 2017 mahoney et al 2016 the anomalously high ar ep counts markedly noticeable during the months of the extended cold season november april is generally attributed to the large scale moisture availability and synoptically driven strong transport mechanisms acting simultaneously during the winter transition months in the region mahoney et al 2016 moore et al 2011 in addition to that a considerable decrease in the ar ep event count is notable from spring to summer seasons for most of the regions as reported by previous studies this is due to the spring to summer decrease in the large scale and persistent mesoscale convective systems in the west of the appalachian mountains as well as due to the smaller number of ars interacting with the cse us region during the warm season debbage et al 2017 parker and ahijevych 2007 rickenbach 2018 in contrast the average precipitation magnitude of the ar ep95p and ar ep99p events is found to be more than 55 90 mm day in louisiana and mississippi in july august september jas and august september october aso seasons the cold season ar ep95p and ar ep99p events on the other hand are found to be characterized by only 35 60 mm daily total precipitation in the seus region these results indicate that the ar ep events in the seus region are more severe during the warm season than those observed in the cold season the association between ars and more severe ep events in the warm season could be related to higher atmospheric instability and moisture availability moore et al 2015 overall this seasonal count cycle seems to be equivalent to the annual ivt cycle reported for the west coast of the us mahoney et al 2016 the largest vapor transport occurring during the winter and markedly decreasing during the summer can be attributed to the weak transient baroclinic instability during the warm season mahoney et al 2016 this is also in agreement with the previous findings that associate ars with the winter planetary wave number 4 5 a wavenumber typically associated with the synoptic scale extratropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere zhu and newell 1998 besides the extratropical cyclones that are most prevalent during the winter are climatologically associated with more number of ars from october to march mahoney et al 2016 3 3 cascading effect of synoptic patterns on moisture availability and transport this section explores the synoptic scale evolution of atmospheric patterns moisture availability and transport mechanisms associated with ar ep events during the extended warm may to october and extended cold november to april season composites of z850 mslp ivt and tcwv refer to section 2 4 for methodology are generated 2 and 5 days prior and during the day of the top 100 severe ar ep events observed during each season it is expected that such spatiotemporal evolution can help to explore the sequence of events thereby revealing any cascading effect if present of these synoptic scale meteorological patterns on the moisture availability and transport associated with the top 100 severe ar ep events moreover the extended warm and cold season months considered in the composite analysis are chosen objectively to meet the criteria of maximum seasonal dependence of ar ep event occurrence and severity in the seus region fig 3 while such seasonal dependence of the severity of the ar ep events is noted in the may october months of the extended warm season for louisiana and mississippi for most of the other states a greater number of ar ep events are observed during the extended cold season months november april fig 3 the spatial distribution of the maximum daily precipitation totals during the selected top 100 ar ep event days is illustrated in fig 4 interestingly for the top 100 severe cold warm season ar ep events are found to exceed a severity of 150 200 mm day in the seus region mostly clustered over the eastern gulf coastal plains western gulf and atlantic coastal plains the most severe cold season ar ep events affected mississippi georgia and alabama whereas louisiana and mississippi experienced the most severe warm season ar ep events fig 4 b and d these results are in close agreement with the spatiotemporal characteristics of the ar ep events during the warm and cold seasons depicted earlier in fig 3 we use the top 100 severe ar ep event days observed for the warm and cold seasons in the subsequent composite analysis firstly we examine the spatiotemporal evolution of synoptic scale meteorological patterns relevant to the occurrence of the top 100 severe ar ep event days by using daily composite anomaly maps of z850 and mslp for the warm and cold seasons finally we investigate if the sequence of spatiotemporal behavior exhibited by such atmospheric patterns shows a cascading effect on the spatiotemporal evolution of moisture advection and source identification associated with the top 100 ar ep events in the region for that daily mean composite maps of the ivt field and daily mean composite anomaly map of tcwv are constructed for both seasons the obtained results are discussed in the following sub sections a synoptic scale meteorological patterns fig 5 a c and fig 5 d f depict the spatiotemporal evolution of anomalies in composites of mslp shading and z850 contour for the cold and warm season respectively 5 days indicated by 5days and 2 days indicated by 2 days prior and on the day indicated by 0 days the events are observed it can be noticed that the composite anomalies indicate a synoptic scale meteorological pattern that exhibits a marked cascading behavior over the region during 5 to 0 days from the time of occurrence of the warm and cold season ar ep events the z850 anomaly contours for the cold season ar ep suggest several trough and ridge shown by positive anomalies formation from 5 and 2 days before the ar ep event occurrences the trough formation shown by negative anomalies occurs along the south of the rockies to the great plains region while the ridge formation occurs along the east of the appalachian along the atlantic coastal plains much of the central plains and the gulf coastal plains are found to correspond to the transition region from the trough to the ridge which is more pronounced on the day of the events 0 days fig 5 c such transitions are typically characterized as a zone of enhanced geostrophic winds winds associated with the middle latitudes aloft in the troposphere making the region more vulnerable to ars moore et al 2011 pasquier et al 2019 mslp anomalies suggest an eastward extension of the bermuda high stretching southwards as the day progresses from 2 days before the day the events are observed this phenomenon is typical of the north atlantic region and is mainly observed during the winter months the extension of bermuda high acts as a block that prevents the frontal systems from curving out to the atlantic ocean which instead steers into the gulf of mexico this also allows the sllj streams to dip further south into the seus region sometimes bringing wintry storms with it thus marking the importance of the confluence of sllj and ars in relation to the ar ep events in seus region the region is characterized by a weak pressure gradient 5 days before the occurrence of the events this pressure gradient however becomes stronger 2 days before the onset of the observed events interestingly on the days of the events 0 days the low pressure anomaly can be seen to intensify and shift southeast covering the locations where the ep events are mainly observed defined by the rectangular bounded region in fig 5 in addition to that the cold season synoptic patterns depict a strong pressure dipole with a strong low pressure center sandwiched between the extended bermuda high and abnormal high pressure existing over the western us this low pressure system in the region is likely to favor the advection of moisture from the southerly winds similarly the z850 anomaly contours for the warm season ar ep depict an intense low pressure center particularly over much of the seus more importantly the low pressure center can be seen to intensify over the western gulf coastal plains and stretch slightly eastwards between 5 and 2 days before the events this low pressure center remains stationary over the region and intensifies until the day of the events covering much of the gulf coastal plain this particular structure is indicative of cut off lows that are often characterized by the presence of a height cap limiting the vertical movement of an air parcel which when moist increases the chances of heavy rainfall barbero et al 2019 a phenomenon reported by moore et al 2011 in connection with the severe flooding across the ohio river basin on may 1 2 2010 in addition to that the mslp pattern exhibits an intense low pressure anomaly in the gulf coastal plains persistent from 2 days before the day of the events this type of persistent low pressure structure is indicative of slowly varying background circulations that favor deep moist convection leading to more severe warm season eps figs 3 and 4 in the region moore et al 2015 nie and fan 2019 b moisture availability and transport to examine the cascading effect of the synoptic scale meteorological patterns on the moisture availability and transport mechanism associated with such ar ep events we calculated the composite mean of the ivt field and anomalies in the composite mean of tcwv for the same event days for the cold and warm season the composite maps for assessing the moisture availability and transport are presented in fig 6 for both cold and warm season intense ivt field over the strong low pressure region in the gulf coastal plains where the ar ep events are observed as depicted previously in fig 4 can be observed to develop 2 days before the event occurrences which amplifies substantially ivt intensity 400 kg m s on the days when these events are observed a dominant role of cllj and strong westerlies associated with the sllj is also notable from the ivt field for the cold season ars the cllj can be seen to cross the yucatan peninsula that phases with the strong sllj steering along the west coast of the gulf of mexico bringing moisture to the region particularly over the lower mississippi river basin for both seasons the ivt field indicates that the ars show a tendency to curve out to the center of the extended bermuda azores high towards the eastern coast of europe this also explains the relatively higher number of ar landfalls along the atlantic coastal plains as indicated by the spatial distribution of ar events in fig 1 e such moisture advection process conforms with the evolution of synoptic meteorological patterns exhibited by the mslp composite anomalies presented in fig 5 a c along the east coast of the gulf of mexico the cllj alone can be seen to dominate the advection of moisture into the region with the caribbean sea and the atlantic ocean being the primary sources of moisture moreover the temporal evolution of the availability of moisture represented by the significantly positive anomalies in tcwv can be seen to mimic that of the ivt magnitude over the region of interest and the surrounding area of the southeast coastal plains for the warm season the ivt field associated with the ars is relatively weaker but spread across a wider area including both the gulf and the atlantic coastal plains fig 6 i the advection of moisture into the region can be primarily associated with the cllj bringing plumes of moisture from the caribbean sea and the atlantic ocean on the other hand the role of cllj coupled with the pacific jet aloft is notable in the moisture transport to the gulf coastal plains the cllj merges with the strong westerlies associated with the pacific jet aloft and steers along the east coast of the gulf of mexico transporting moisture to the lower mississippi basin where it connects with the gpllj this phenomenon dubbed the maya express has been previously reported in connection with the warm season flooding in the midwest us dirmeyer and kinter 2010 2009 and closely matches with the moisture advection mechanisms reported in debbage et al 2017 this is also indicative of a higher moisture flux distributed throughout the lower tropospheric column that highly increases the chance of very heavy rainfall if sufficient convective available potential energy cape is present rabinowitz et al 2019 the transport of moisture to these regions are dominated by two distinct branches of llj propagation that can be seen to become stronger during 2 0 days from the event occurrences thereby confirming a cascading effect of the synoptic patterns on the moisture transportation by ars into the region fig 5 d f furthermore the southeastern coastal plains are shown to exhibit an intense stationary low pressure system associated with the warm season ar eps fig 5 d f the persistent low pressure structure favors deep moist convection leading to more severe warm season ar eps in the region moore et al 2015 nie and fan 2019 this is further reinforced by the relatively greater moisture availability associated with the warm season ar eps as indicated by the significantly 13 16 mm higher positive anomalies of tcwv on the days of the events fig 6 i the linkages between the spatial evolution of the moisture advection mechanisms and ar related precipitation events are in close agreement with previous studies that identify the gulf of mexico as the primary source of moisture this highlights the role of cllj and the pacific jet aloft in the advection of moisture into the region debbage et al 2017 dirmeyer and kinter 2010 2009 lavers and villarini 2013b moore et al 2011 rabinowitz et al 2019 overall the evolution of the source of moisture and its advection associated with the warm and cold season ar ep events suggest the presence of a cascading effect from the synoptic scale meteorological patterns exhibited by the evolution of mslp and z850 composite anomalies in fig 5 our results produce new information related to the sequential development of available moisture and advection processes associated with ars that finally lead to the most severe ep events in the seus region the cold season ar eps are more frequent and driven by relatively stronger dynamical systems indicated by greater ivt intensity on the other hand the warm season ar eps are more severe and caused by higher atmospheric instability and more moist conditions characterized by stationary low pressure structures and higher tcwv anomalies 4 synthesis and conclusion we investigated the cascading impact of synoptic scale atmospheric patterns on the advection mechanisms linked to the atmospheric river related extreme precipitation events in the coastal south east us seus spatiotemporal variation of the ar ep event suggests a strong seasonal dependence across most states in the seus region while a greater number of ar ep events are observed during the cold season the events are found to be more severe in the warm season the spatiotemporal evolution of relevant synoptic features suggested a strong cascading effect on the key mechanisms moisture availability and mode of advection that drive the occurrence of ar ep events during the warm and cold seasons in the seus region the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a overall 14 992 landfalling ars were detected after removing the tcs from 1979 to 2019 compared to the warm seasons a relatively greater number of ar activities were observed during the cold seasons the maximum 12 15 number of ar events per year was reported for the seus region s easternmost states these regions experience 11 16 ep95p and 3 5 ep99p events per year b the higher number of ar ep events were observed along the northwestern coast of the florida peninsula and south of georgia in addition to that about 3 5 ar ep99p and at least 1 2 ar ep99p events per year are found to occur in the entire eastern part of the seus region seasonal counts of ar ep event occurrences and average precipitation magnitudes showed a pronounced seasonal dependence fifty ar ep95p and twelve ar ep99p events were observed over georgia florida alabama and south carolina during the ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam seasons only a few ar ep events less than 5 10 events are found to occur during the extended warm season months amj to son over the entire seus region on the other hand the average precipitation magnitude of the ar ep95p and ar ep99p events is found to be relatively greater 55 90 mm day in the warm seasons c the evolution of z850 anomalies associated with the cold season ar ep events suggested several troughs and ridge formations across much of the central plains and the gulf coastal plains these regions are characterized by a zone of enhanced geostrophic winds indicating highly anomalous weather conditions on the other hand the warm season anomalies indicated a gradual strengthening of a persistent low pressure system 2 days before the event timings resembling that of cut off lows in the region covering much of the gulf coastal plains that might trigger enhancement of heavy rainfall events in the presence of ars the spatiotemporal evolution of the composite anomalies in mslp associated with the cold season top 100 ar ep events exhibited strengthening of a pressure dipole with an eastward extension of the bermuda high and a high pressure center over the western us d the moisture transport depicted by the composites of the ivt field associated with both the cold and warm season ar ep events are found to mimic the spatiotemporal evolution of the mslp and z850 composites for the respective seasons during the cold warm season ivt intensity gradually strengthens 2 days 5 days 2 days prior to the events and steer over the seus region finally moving up to the atlantic ocean however compared to the cold season the warm season ar eps are associated with relatively weaker ivt strength in addition to that relatively moister conditions were found to be associated with the warm season ar eps which is indicated by significantly higher tcwv anomalies over the affected region the marked increase in moisture availability is attributed to the slowly varying background circulations that favor deep moist convection leading to more severe warm season eps in the region moore et al 2015 nie and fan 2019 such spatiotemporal evolution confirmed the cascading effect of synoptic patterns on the moisture availability and mode of advection associated with ar ep events in the seus region the results from this study are expected to provide adequate understanding and background that will help predict future ar ep events in the seus region the seasonal ar characteristics presented here may be extended further to assess the seasonal water cycle influenced by ars in the region which can significantly aid in the advanced planning and management of water resources related to ars the synoptic meteorological characteristics discussed in this study can be used as important priors to design early warning and management systems related to ar driven floods in the seus future research will aim to address the uncertainties associated with the detection of ars in the region rutz et al 2019 shields et al 2018a the impact of other modes of climate variabilities or if global warming plays a significant role in modulating the statistical behavior or time of emergence of ars in the seus the possible impact of monsoon ridges on the precipitation variability and its coupling with the large scale climate variabilities khedun et al 2014 or the combined impact of occurrence intensity and duration of ars chen et al 2018 can be examined there is also a need to explore the interplay between the ars and other physical mechanisms such as cape

4328,the past few decades have witnessed an intensification of extreme precipitation ep events triggered by atmospheric rivers ars leading to massive flooding highlighting the importance of studying the physical mechanisms associated with these types of events this study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of ars and related extreme precipitation ar ep events and the cascading effect of the synoptic scale meteorological patterns on underlying processes in the coastal states of the southeastern united states sues during the 1979 2019 period the seasonal frequency of ep events associated with ars suggests that more frequent ar ep events occur during the colder months november to april in contrast the ar ep events are less frequent but more severe in the warmer months may to october a total of 12 15 ar ep events with severity exceeding the 99th percentile precipitation threshold were observed during the 3 month overlapping seasons between november and april from 1979 to 2019 that affected georgia florida alabama and south carolina on the other hand the average precipitation magnitude of the ar ep events is relatively higher 55 90 mm day in the warmer months may to october to explore the cascading nature of relevant meteorological forcing on the physical processes that favor such events we performed an event centered composite analysis based on the top 100 severe ar ep events observed during the extended cold and warm season separately it was observed that during the progression of the ar ep events the anomalies associated with composite mean sea level pressure mslp and 850mb geopotential height z850 make a transition from the trough to ridge formation along with a south eastward extension of bermuda high in the cold season the spatiotemporal evolution of these meteorological variables is found to have a cascading effect on the mode of moisture transport indicated by integrated vapor transport ivt and moisture availability shown by total column water vapor associated with the major ar ep events the warm season ivt field gets stronger 2 days before the ar ep event occurrences indicating a continuous increase in moisture influx into the gulf and atlantic coastal plains similar strengthening of ivt is noted over the gulf coastal plains during the cold season a cascading effect is also noted for the moisture availability indicated by a significant increase in total column water vapor tcwv over the gulf of mexico 2 days before the events overall the cold season ar eps are driven by relatively stronger dynamical systems indicated by greater ivt intensity in contrast the warm season ar eps are associated with a weaker ivt field higher atmospheric instability and more moist conditions keywords atmospheric rivers coastal seus

frequency in different parts of the world madsen et al 2014 mishra and singh 2010 papalexiou and montanari 2019 vu and mishra 2019 much of this intensification is attributed to the acceleration of the

features such as atmospheric rivers ars payne et al 2020 extreme precipitation and flooding associated with ars have been reported in various parts of the globe kamae et al 2017 lavers et al 2012 lavers and villarini 2013a paltan et al 2017 ramos et al 2015 waliser and guan 2017 including the us barth et al 2017 debbage et al 2017 mahoney et al 2016 moore et al 2011 ralph et al 2017 ralph and dettinger 2011 ars are long narrow corridors of strong poleward water vapor transport across the mid latitudes neiman et al 2008b newell et al 1992 zhu and newell 1998 they can be associated with the warm conveyor belt of extratropical cyclones and are often characterized by strong low level winds ars are also responsible for approximately 90 of all pole ward atmospheric water vapor transport across the mid latitudes guan and waliser 2015 zhu and newell 1998 ars have a varied extent of societal and eco hydrological impacts which range from beneficial to devastating for example ars are one of the major contributors to the snowpack and freshwater resources in the arid portions of the southwestern us and responsible for 20 50 of the region s rainfall accumulation dettinger et al 2011 ars have been associated with 30 to 60 of the annual variability of total runoff thereby impacting the seasonal availability of water resources in the west coast of the us chen et al 2019 landfalling ar storms are also recognized as potential drought busters in the pacific northwest by overcoming nearly 60 70 of all persistent droughts in the region dettinger 2013 ars are even known for causing megafloods often dubbed as arkstorms these events impact thousands of square miles of urban and agricultural land across the us disrupting millions of lives and causing massive economic damages porter et al 2011 so far more than 99 of all reported flood damages in the western us have been attributed to severe landfalling ar storms corringham et al 2019 however the impact of ars is not limited to the west coast of the us in the southeastern us the major historical 1000 year flood event that occurred on may 1 2 2010 has been attributed to ars moore et al 2011 which affected significant parts of tennessee kentucky and mississippi this specific series of ars resulted in sustained precipitation for 48 h as high as 344 7 mm over nashville tennessee leading to flash flooding that resulted in 26 fatalities and caused 2 3 billion of property damages moore et al 2011 recognizing the potential socio economic damages e g agricultural and devastating flood damages caused by the ars in the seus there has been a growing concern on the ar activities along the coastal southeast us seus gimeno et al 2014 many studies highlighted the possible association between major flood events in the central and southeastern us with strong water vapor transport into the seus from multiple moisture sources such as the caribbean sea the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean dirmeyer and kinter 2010 2009 guan and waliser 2015 lavers and villarini 2013b moore et al 2011 pfahl et al 2013 an enhanced source of moisture originating in the caribbean and the gulf of mexico can trigger large scale flood events in the mid western us during may july dirmeyer and kinter 2010 the study detected a narrow fetch of moisture steering along the coast of central america extending from the yucatan peninsula and moving all the way upwards to the western gulf of mexico where it connects with the great plains low level jet gpllj a phenomena dubbed maya express dirmeyer and kinter 2009 further lavers and villarini 2013b highlighted that much of the annual maxima floods from 1105 basins across the central us and reported that in 42 5 of the basins more than half of the flood events are associated with ars interacting with the seus the major flooding event in the ohio river valley may 1 2 2010 was triggered by the ars that originated from the eastern tropical pacific and the caribbean sea moore et al 2011 these studies highlighted the significant role of ars in causing major flood events more recently global guan and waliser 2015 and regional studies debbage et al 2017 mahoney et al 2016 miller et al 2017 rabinowitz et al 2019 have provided crucial information on the climatological and synoptic aspects of ars affecting the seus more than 10 of ar landfalls along the gulf of mexico and gulf stream contributed to more than 30 of the annual precipitation over most parts of the southeastern us guan and waliser 2015 during the period 1980 2010 nearly 41 of the heavy precipitation events 100 mm day and 52 of the spatially widespread heavy precipitation events affecting 7000 km2 area in the southeastern us were associated with ars mahoney et al 2016 focusing on persistent ar events with a duration of at least 48 h debbage et al 2017 reported that total 40 persistent ar events per year occurred along the seus coastline locations between 1979 and 2014 the study also highlights the potential role of great plains jet gpj and caribbean low level jet cllj on the seus ars which happens to interact with the western gulf of mexico miller et al 2017 investigated the synoptic patterns associated with minor major flood events in the pigeon river basin located downstream of the southern appalachian mountains over 5 years period the synoptic patterns were found to reveal the role of a highly amplified slow moving positively tilted trough formation that favored the ar ep events over the region rabinowitz et al 2019 selected 15 ar events between 2000 and 2015 across the mississippi river valley and categorized their associated synoptic patterns as progressive troughs multiple studies have highlighted the potential role of persistent atmospheric anomalies and structure of moisture transport for a better understanding of the behavior of ar ep events dirmeyer and kinter 2010 moore et al 2011 rabinowitz et al 2019 steinschneider et al 2018 zhu and newell 1998 more specifically based on the available moisture sources and transport mechanism it is possible to generate information related to the atmospheric conditions that are particularly moist and unstable at the same time these synoptic conditions progressively intensify with time triggering a sequence of favorable conditions for moisture transport and advection until they finally lead to the occurrence of heavy precipitation events in such a context cascading effects have been increasingly investigated to understand the sequence of interconnected processes that ultimately lead to extreme precipitation events the cascading effects can be examined based on the evolution of meteorological features and moisture influx associated with the days before the ar ep events while previous studies explored the role of ars in driving ep events over the seus the potential influence of atmospheric anomalies on such processes was partly explored debbage et al 2017 mahoney et al 2016 furthermore investigating the influence of atmospheric anomalies only for coastal interactions debbage et al 2017 limits our understanding of such processes driving ep events across the seus region this study begins with determining the variation of ep events with respect to ar events in the next step the synoptic feature s space time evolution is investigated to understand its cascading effect on the moisture transport that influenced the 100 most severe ar ep events during the cold and warm season separately more specifically the primary objective of this study is to address the following questions 1 how are the ar events and ar ep events distributed spatially and across different seasons in eight seus states florida alabama mississippi louisiana georgia north carolina south carolina

finally the summary of major findings and concluding remarks are provided in section 4 2 data and methodology 2 1 data ar events are identified within the region bounded by latitudes 15 n to 45 n and longitudes 110 w to 55 w hereafter referred to as the ar detection region detection of ars is performed by using specific humidity and zonal and meridional wind fields for 20 pressure levels between 1000 and 300 hpa inclusive retrieved at 6 hourly time steps for the period 1979 2019 from the high resolution european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis 5 era5 0 25 x 0 25 grid resolution the hurricane track data from 1979 to 2019 is obtained from the atlantic hurricane database hurdat2 to segregate the ars from the tropical cyclones tcs the hurdat2 is available at 6 hourly

patterns and their cascading effect on the moisture transport mechanisms as such 6 hourly z850 total column water vapor tcwv and mslp data were obtained from the era 5 at the native spatial resolution for the 1979 2019 period while mslp and z850 are extensively used to define the large scale meteorological patterns that have a primary influence on extreme precipitation events barlow et al 2019 tcwv is an essential component to assess the moisture availability associated with ar eps gimeno et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 the impact of ars on the precipitation and ep events are studied for the seus region that includes the eight coastal states namely alabama al georgia ga louisiana la mississippi ms north carolina nc south carolina sc texas tx and florida fl the ep events are derived based on

dataset provided by noaa s cpc is produced from global unified gauge based analysis from over 30 000 stations with a daily time step chen et al 2008 the cpc data has been validated against historical records and measurements at nearby stations concurrent radar satellite observations and numerical model forecasts to maintain consistency in spatial resolution across all datasets used in the study we apply the synergraphic mapping system symap maurer et al 2002 to regrid the reanalysis dataset at the 0 5 cpc precipitation grid resolution reanalysis data available at 0 5 x0 5 is reasonable to capture the ars and their potential influence on the ep events payne et al 2020 and multiple studies investigated regional ar behavior at the same or coarser resolution debbage et al 2017 guan and waliser 2015 lavers and villarini 2013b 2013a mahoney et al 2016 paltan et al 2017 2 2 ar detection methodology ars are derived based on an ar detection algorithm guan and waliser 2015 that incorporates the characteristics of vertically integrated vapor transport ivt within the lower troposphere at 6 hourly time steps the ivt measures the integrated moisture flux based on specific humidity and zonal and meridional wind characteristics considering the dual drivers of ar behavior integrated water vapor and wind the ivt magnitude or intensity is increasingly used to diagnose ars across various parts of the globe guan and waliser 2015 mundhenk et al 2016 rabinowitz et al 2019 shields et al 2018b waliser and guan 2017 the ivt intensity is calculated in a eulerian framework by performing a mass weighted vertical integration within the pressure levels ranging from 1000 to 300 hpa as follows 1 ivt 1 g 1000 300 qudp 2 1 g 1000 300 qvdp 2 where g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s 2 q is specific humidity kg kg 1 u is zonal wind m s v is meridional wind m s and dp is the pressure difference pa between adjacent pressure levels the algorithm has been applied in many recent studies related to ars debbage et al 2017 huning et al 2019 kim et al 2018 waliser and guan 2017 the reader is referred to guan and waliser 2015 for a detailed discussion on the ar detection algorithm the underlying motivation sensitivity analysis and its application a brief discussion on the ar detection procedure is summarized in appendix a1 of the supplementary material it is important to note that at any time step one or more ar landfalls may be detected provided all the requirements see appendix a1 of the supplementary material are fulfilled the algorithm detected a total of 14 992 landfalling ars in the ar detection region which is 25 03 of the total 59 900 six hourly time steps during the study period 1979 2019 2 3 ar event and ar ep event identification the impact of the ars on the ep events is investigated for the grid cells 0 5 x0 5 located within the eight seus states tropical cyclones are seldom identified as a common source of heavy rainfall in the southeastern united states knight and davis 2009 mahoney et al 2016 to assess the contribution from ars alone we removed the effect of tropical cyclones tc from the analysis of ar ep events this is achieved by removing the ar days that coincide with the tc dates out of the detected landfalling ars we found 12 645 ars occurring over at least one grid cell during the 1979 2019 period within or on the seus region boundary ar duration is an important variable that controls precipitation magnitudes ralph et al 2013 an ar event is identified based on the duration of ars that occurred for three or more time steps 18 h or more lavers and villarini 2013a ralph et al 2013 and these ar events can generate extreme precipitation events lavers and villarini 2013a ralph et al 2019 2013 a similar methodology was used to examine the association between ar and extreme precipitation storms for the us s west coast lamjiri et al 2017 ralph et al 2019 and europe lavers and villarini 2013a the ar events are identified based on all the 12 645 landfalling ars two ars were considered independent distinct events if they were separated by more than 1 day extreme precipitation events are determined by applying the peak over threshold method mishra and singh 2010 mondal et al 2020 for the seus grid locations the daily extreme precipitation events are first identified based on the 95th ep95p and 99th ep99p percentile threshold separately these percentiles are calculated for all non zero daily precipitation totals observed during the whole time period 1979 2019 finally an ar ep event is defined as the extreme precipitation event observed during or one day after an ar event this concept of ar events facilitates the association with the daily precipitation data and have been extensively used in previous studies e g guan et al 2010 huning et al 2019 lavers and villarini 2013a 2013b neiman et al 2008a it should be noted that throughout the manuscript the ar ep events evaluated based on the 95th 99th percentile threshold are referred to as ar ep95p ar ep99p 2 4 composite analysis an event centered composite analysis is performed to examine the evolution of the synoptic meteorological features and moisture availability and advection so far event centered composite analysis has been extensively used in numerous studies to explore the relevant synoptic scale meteorological features associated with a specific meteorological event barlow et al 2019 the event centered composite analysis is performed based on the top 100 severe ar ep99p events selected separately for the extended warm may october and cold november april seasons firstly the ar ep99p time series for individual grids across the seus region for a given season warm and cold are selected to form a matrix with the dates and the corresponding ar ep magnitude representing the columns of the matrix the daily ar ep magnitudes are then arranged in a decreasing order to identify the top 100 ar ep events with unique dates for the composite analysis the selected event days are used to obtain the seasonal anomalies in composites of meteorological variables at zero day 2 day and 5 day lags this approach is useful for exploring the sequence of interconnected processes cascading effect driving the top 100 severe ar ep events more specifically seasonal anomalies in the daily mean composites of the meteorological variables mslp z850 and tcwv are calculated at every grid location by subtracting the mean of daily values coinciding with the time of occurrence of the selected top 100 ar ep events from the long term mean for the 1979 2019 period furthermore a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test ks test is performed to determine the statistical significance at 95 confidence level of the anomalies at every grid location to determine the moisture advection into the region we calculate the composite mean of the daily ivt field during which the top 100 ar ep events are observed for every grid location finally to assess their temporal evolution over time each of these composite and composite anomalies are also calculated for 5 days and 2 days prior to the occurrence of the top 100 ar ep events a similar approach has been adopted by ridder et al 2018 to investigate the temporal evolution of atmospheric conditions associated with ar influenced ep along the dutch coast 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of ep and ar events in seus ep events generally affect a varied range of areas smaller to larger across the seus throughout the year moore et al 2015 to understand the spatial patterns associated with ep and ar events in the seus we constructed spatial maps showing the number of ep95p ep99p and only ar after removing the tcs events fig 1 a c and e depicts the spatial distribution of the annual event counts of ep95p ep99p and ar respectively for the 1979 2019 period the results are further summarized as boxplots based on the eight seus states shown in fig 1 b d and f fig 1 a d show that except for texas all other states are affected by 11 16 2 5 ep95p ep99p events per year a homogenous spatial pattern is noted for the ep95p event counts across most parts of the seus region eastward of texas the ep99p event counts however vary considerably across the seus with a higher number of events clustered in the eastern gulf coastal plains and the western part of the florida peninsula this is also indicated by the boxplots in fig 1 d that show a comparatively greater 3 5 number of ep99p events per year observed over georgia florida alabama and south carolina fig 1 e f shows that the rate of ar activities is found to be relatively higher along the atlantic coastal plain of the seus more than 12 ar events are observed per year over the southeastern appalachian range extending southwards along the atlantic coastal plain up to the southern tip of the florida peninsula this spatial distribution is mirrored by the boxplots depicted for the eight seus states as shown in fig 4 f a relatively greater 12 15 number of ar events per year affects the easternmost states including larger portions of south carolina florida north carolina and georgia furthermore the spatial distribution of ar event counts closely matches the spatial pattern exhibited by the ep95p events especially along the eastern coast of nc sc georgia and florida located along the east side of the appalachian range interestingly the regions showing a higher frequency of ar events are found to be located along the trajectory of the sub tropical low level jet streams sllj attributed to the atlantic warm pool wang and lee 2007 the sllj represents a persistent air mass influx into the subtropics and possibly supplies a significant share of moisture into the region combined with ars that typically act along the cllj or westerlies in the region this favors the influx of moisture into this region resulting in most ar activities along the coast of atlantic coastal plains 3 2 ar ep characteristics in seus ars have been typically associated with ep events across different parts of the globe dettinger 2011 gimeno et al 2014 guirguis et al 2019 mahoney et al 2016 moore et al 2011 rutz et al 2013 tsuji and takayabu 2019 valenzuela and garreaud 2019 the pronounced temporal and location dependent behavior exhibited by the number of ar event occurrences as seen earlier is likely to be reflected in the ep occurrences driven by the ars which is the focus of this analysis as such using daily observations of precipitation accumulation from cpc the ar ep events are identified at every grid point based on a peak over threshold approach as discussed in section 2 4 figure s1 shows the geographical distribution of 95th and 99th percentile thresholds based on which the peak over threshold methodology is applied to the daily precipitation totals in this section we explore mainly two characteristics of ar ep events the spatial distribution of the frequency per year of the ar ep events and the seasonal variation of the frequency and the average magnitude of these events across the seus region the annual frequency of ar ep events is examined at each grid point to identify any location dependent behavior revealed by the observed ar ep events during the selected period fig 2 a d shows the spatial distribution of the annual frequency of ar ep95 and ar ep99 events for the seus region and eight states for the 1979 2019 period in addition to that we also examine the precipitation characteristics spatial distribution and magnitude across the seus region for selected ars observed during 3rd and 4th may 2010 due to their association with large scale flooding mahoney et al 2016 as shown in fig 2 e f the seasonal variations of the total ar ep event count and average magnitudes for the 1979 2019 period are depicted by heatmaps as shown in fig 3 the seasonal variations are supposed to reveal any temporal dependence exhibited by ar driven ep events and their severity in the seus and including states as shown in fig 2 a b the spatial patterns depicted by the annual frequency of ar ep events are also in close agreement with that obtained for the ep and ar events fig 1 about 3 5 ar ep99p and at least 1 2 ar ep99p events per year are found to occur in the eastern part of the seus region with the greatest number of events occurring primarily in the sub tropical region along the northwestern coast of the florida peninsula and south of georgia the higher rate of ar ep events in these regions is also reminiscent of the fact that about 90 of the total water vapor flux is attributed to ars located within the sub tropics ralph et al 2004 zhu and newell 1998 these results are further reflected by the boxplots that show the greatest number of ar ep events occurred in florida and georgia fig 2 c d these results are concordant with the spatial pattern exhibited by the ep99p event counts for these regions fig 1 d fig 2 e f shows the spatial pattern and severity of the ar ep events that cause extreme socio economic damages in the past we selected two consecutive ars observed on 3rd and 4th may 2010 it can be noted that these ars are associated with a daily precipitation total of more than 100 mm observed across the junction between the gulf and atlantic coastal plain of the seus fig 2 f previous studies have reported these ars were associated with major historic flooding in the seus mahoney et al 2016 moore et al 2011 to explore the temporal dynamics of the ar ep event characteristics we examine the seasonal variation of the total event counts and average precipitation magnitude for the seus region and the eight including states for the 1979 2019 period the seasonal variation of total ar ep event counts and average precipitation magnitude are examined based on the seasons defined by a 3 month overlapping windows for all 12 months the 3 month overlap allows for scaling the seasons to represent uniform 90 day seasons based on this criterion we obtained the regional averages of seasonal counts of ar ep95p and ar ep99p events and the corresponding average precipitation magnitudes as illustrated by the heatmaps in fig 3 a b and fig 3 c d respectively a marked cold season dependence is noticeable in the total ar ep event occurrences a greater number of events is noted over georgia florida alabama and south carolina during the october november december ond november december january ndj december january february djf january february march jfm february march april fma and march april may mam season fig 3 a and c these regions show a total of more than 50 ar ep95p and 12 15 ar ep99p events in each overlapping season between november and april during the 41 year period 1979 2019 only a few ar ep events less than 5 10 events are found to occur during the extended warm season months april may june amj to september october november son over the entire seus region these findings are in close agreement with previous studies that suggest the possible contribution of ars to more frequent rainfall events in the seus with a greater influence observed predominantly during the cold season debbage et al 2017 mahoney et al 2016 the anomalously high ar ep counts markedly noticeable during the months of the extended cold season november april is generally attributed to the large scale moisture availability and synoptically driven strong transport mechanisms acting simultaneously during the winter transition months in the region mahoney et al 2016 moore et al 2011 in addition to that a considerable decrease in the ar ep event count is notable from spring to summer seasons for most of the regions as reported by previous studies this is due to the spring to summer decrease in the large scale and persistent mesoscale convective systems in the west of the appalachian mountains as well as due to the smaller number of ars interacting with the cse us region during the warm season debbage et al 2017 parker and ahijevych 2007 rickenbach 2018 in contrast the average precipitation magnitude of the ar ep95p and ar ep99p events is found to be more than 55 90 mm day in louisiana and mississippi in july august september jas and august september october aso seasons the cold season ar ep95p and ar ep99p events on the other hand are found to be characterized by only 35 60 mm daily total precipitation in the seus region these results indicate that the ar ep events in the seus region are more severe during the warm season than those observed in the cold season the association between ars and more severe ep events in the warm season could be related to higher atmospheric instability and moisture availability moore et al 2015 overall this seasonal count cycle seems to be equivalent to the annual ivt cycle reported for the west coast of the us mahoney et al 2016 the largest vapor transport occurring during the winter and markedly decreasing during the summer can be attributed to the weak transient baroclinic instability during the warm season mahoney et al 2016 this is also in agreement with the previous findings that associate ars with the winter planetary wave number 4 5 a wavenumber typically associated with the synoptic scale extratropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere zhu and newell 1998 besides the extratropical cyclones that are most prevalent during the winter are climatologically associated with more number of ars from october to march mahoney et al 2016 3 3 cascading effect of synoptic patterns on moisture availability and transport this section explores the synoptic scale evolution of atmospheric patterns moisture availability and transport mechanisms associated with ar ep events during the extended warm may to october and extended cold november to april season composites of z850 mslp ivt and tcwv refer to section 2 4 for methodology are generated 2 and 5 days prior and during the day of the top 100 severe ar ep events observed during each season it is expected that such spatiotemporal evolution can help to explore the sequence of events thereby revealing any cascading effect if present of these synoptic scale meteorological patterns on the moisture availability and transport associated with the top 100 severe ar ep events moreover the extended warm and cold season months considered in the composite analysis are chosen objectively to meet the criteria of maximum seasonal dependence of ar ep event occurrence and severity in the seus region fig 3 while such seasonal dependence of the severity of the ar ep events is noted in the may october months of the extended warm season for louisiana and mississippi for most of the other states a greater number of ar ep events are observed during the extended cold season months november april fig 3 the spatial distribution of the maximum daily precipitation totals during the selected top 100 ar ep event days is illustrated in fig 4 interestingly for the top 100 severe cold warm season ar ep events are found to exceed a severity of 150 200 mm day in the seus region mostly clustered over the eastern gulf coastal plains western gulf and atlantic coastal plains the most severe cold season ar ep events affected mississippi georgia and alabama whereas louisiana and mississippi experienced the most severe warm season ar ep events fig 4 b and d these results are in close agreement with the spatiotemporal characteristics of the ar ep events during the warm and cold seasons depicted earlier in fig 3 we use the top 100 severe ar ep event days observed for the warm and cold seasons in the subsequent composite analysis firstly we examine the spatiotemporal evolution of synoptic scale meteorological patterns relevant to the occurrence of the top 100 severe ar ep event days by using daily composite anomaly maps of z850 and mslp for the warm and cold seasons finally we investigate if the sequence of spatiotemporal behavior exhibited by such atmospheric patterns shows a cascading effect on the spatiotemporal evolution of moisture advection and source identification associated with the top 100 ar ep events in the region for that daily mean composite maps of the ivt field and daily mean composite anomaly map of tcwv are constructed for both seasons the obtained results are discussed in the following sub sections a synoptic scale meteorological patterns fig 5 a c and fig 5 d f depict the spatiotemporal evolution of anomalies in composites of mslp shading and z850 contour for the cold and warm season respectively 5 days indicated by 5days and 2 days indicated by 2 days prior and on the day indicated by 0 days the events are observed it can be noticed that the composite anomalies indicate a synoptic scale meteorological pattern that exhibits a marked cascading behavior over the region during 5 to 0 days from the time of occurrence of the warm and cold season ar ep events the z850 anomaly contours for the cold season ar ep suggest several trough and ridge shown by positive anomalies formation from 5 and 2 days before the ar ep event occurrences the trough formation shown by negative anomalies occurs along the south of the rockies to the great plains region while the ridge formation occurs along the east of the appalachian along the atlantic coastal plains much of the central plains and the gulf coastal plains are found to correspond to the transition region from the trough to the ridge which is more pronounced on the day of the events 0 days fig 5 c such transitions are typically characterized as a zone of enhanced geostrophic winds winds associated with the middle latitudes aloft in the troposphere making the region more vulnerable to ars moore et al 2011 pasquier et al 2019 mslp anomalies suggest an eastward extension of the bermuda high stretching southwards as the day progresses from 2 days before the day the events are observed this phenomenon is typical of the north atlantic region and is mainly observed during the winter months the extension of bermuda high acts as a block that prevents the frontal systems from curving out to the atlantic ocean which instead steers into the gulf of mexico this also allows the sllj streams to dip further south into the seus region sometimes bringing wintry storms with it thus marking the importance of the confluence of sllj and ars in relation to the ar ep events in seus region the region is characterized by a weak pressure gradient 5 days before the occurrence of the events this pressure gradient however becomes stronger 2 days before the onset of the observed events interestingly on the days of the events 0 days the low pressure anomaly can be seen to intensify and shift southeast covering the locations where the ep events are mainly observed defined by the rectangular bounded region in fig 5 in addition to that the cold season synoptic patterns depict a strong pressure dipole with a strong low pressure center sandwiched between the extended bermuda high and abnormal high pressure existing over the western us this low pressure system in the region is likely to favor the advection of moisture from the southerly winds similarly the z850 anomaly contours for the warm season ar ep depict an intense low pressure center particularly over much of the seus more importantly the low pressure center can be seen to intensify over the western gulf coastal plains and stretch slightly eastwards between 5 and 2 days before the events this low pressure center remains stationary over the region and intensifies until the day of the events covering much of the gulf coastal plain this particular structure is indicative of cut off lows that are often characterized by the presence of a height cap limiting the vertical movement of an air parcel which when moist increases the chances of heavy rainfall barbero et al 2019 a phenomenon reported by moore et al 2011 in connection with the severe flooding across the ohio river basin on may 1 2 2010 in addition to that the mslp pattern exhibits an intense low pressure anomaly in the gulf coastal plains persistent from 2 days before the day of the events this type of persistent low pressure structure is indicative of slowly varying background circulations that favor deep moist convection leading to more severe warm season eps figs 3 and 4 in the region moore et al 2015 nie and fan 2019 b moisture availability and transport to examine the cascading effect of the synoptic scale meteorological patterns on the moisture availability and transport mechanism associated with such ar ep events we calculated the composite mean of the ivt field and anomalies in the composite mean of tcwv for the same event days for the cold and warm season the composite maps for assessing the moisture availability and transport are presented in fig 6 for both cold and warm season intense ivt field over the strong low pressure region in the gulf coastal plains where the ar ep events are observed as depicted previously in fig 4 can be observed to develop 2 days before the event occurrences which amplifies substantially ivt intensity 400 kg m s on the days when these events are observed a dominant role of cllj and strong westerlies associated with the sllj is also notable from the ivt field for the cold season ars the cllj can be seen to cross the yucatan peninsula that phases with the strong sllj steering along the west coast of the gulf of mexico bringing moisture to the region particularly over the lower mississippi river basin for both seasons the ivt field indicates that the ars show a tendency to curve out to the center of the extended bermuda azores high towards the eastern coast of europe this also explains the relatively higher number of ar landfalls along the atlantic coastal plains as indicated by the spatial distribution of ar events in fig 1 e such moisture advection process conforms with the evolution of synoptic meteorological patterns exhibited by the mslp composite anomalies presented in fig 5 a c along the east coast of the gulf of mexico the cllj alone can be seen to dominate the advection of moisture into the region with the caribbean sea and the atlantic ocean being the primary sources of moisture moreover the temporal evolution of the availability of moisture represented by the significantly positive anomalies in tcwv can be seen to mimic that of the ivt magnitude over the region of interest and the surrounding area of the southeast coastal plains for the warm season the ivt field associated with the ars is relatively weaker but spread across a wider area including both the gulf and the atlantic coastal plains fig 6 i the advection of moisture into the region can be primarily associated with the cllj bringing plumes of moisture from the caribbean sea and the atlantic ocean on the other hand the role of cllj coupled with the pacific jet aloft is notable in the moisture transport to the gulf coastal plains the cllj merges with the strong westerlies associated with the pacific jet aloft and steers along the east coast of the gulf of mexico transporting moisture to the lower mississippi basin where it connects with the gpllj this phenomenon dubbed the maya express has been previously reported in connection with the warm season flooding in the midwest us dirmeyer and kinter 2010 2009 and closely matches with the moisture advection mechanisms reported in debbage et al 2017 this is also indicative of a higher moisture flux distributed throughout the lower tropospheric column that highly increases the chance of very heavy rainfall if sufficient convective available potential energy cape is present rabinowitz et al 2019 the transport of moisture to these regions are dominated by two distinct branches of llj propagation that can be seen to become stronger during 2 0 days from the event occurrences thereby confirming a cascading effect of the synoptic patterns on the moisture transportation by ars into the region fig 5 d f furthermore the southeastern coastal plains are shown to exhibit an intense stationary low pressure system associated with the warm season ar eps fig 5 d f the persistent low pressure structure favors deep moist convection leading to more severe warm season ar eps in the region moore et al 2015 nie and fan 2019 this is further reinforced by the relatively greater moisture availability associated with the warm season ar eps as indicated by the significantly 13 16 mm higher positive anomalies of tcwv on the days of the events fig 6 i the linkages between the spatial evolution of the moisture advection mechanisms and ar related precipitation events are in close agreement with previous studies that identify the gulf of mexico as the primary source of moisture this highlights the role of cllj and the pacific jet aloft in the advection of moisture into the region debbage et al 2017 dirmeyer and kinter 2010 2009 lavers and villarini 2013b moore et al 2011 rabinowitz et al 2019 overall the evolution of the source of moisture and its advection associated with the warm and cold season ar ep events suggest the presence of a cascading effect from the synoptic scale meteorological patterns exhibited by the evolution of mslp and z850 composite anomalies in fig 5 our results produce new information related to the sequential development of available moisture and advection processes associated with ars that finally lead to the most severe ep events in the seus region the cold season ar eps are more frequent and driven by relatively stronger dynamical systems indicated by greater ivt intensity on the other hand the warm season ar eps are more severe and caused by higher atmospheric instability and more moist conditions characterized by stationary low pressure structures and higher tcwv anomalies 4 synthesis and conclusion we investigated the cascading impact of synoptic scale atmospheric patterns on the advection mechanisms linked to the atmospheric river related extreme precipitation events in the coastal south east us seus spatiotemporal variation of the ar ep event suggests a strong seasonal dependence across most states in the seus region while a greater number of ar ep events are observed during the cold season the events are found to be more severe in the warm season the spatiotemporal evolution of relevant synoptic features suggested a strong cascading effect on the key mechanisms moisture availability and mode of advection that drive the occurrence of ar ep events during the warm and cold seasons in the seus region the following conclusions can be drawn from this study a overall 14 992 landfalling ars were detected after removing the tcs from 1979 to 2019 compared to the warm seasons a relatively greater number of ar activities were observed during the cold seasons the maximum 12 15 number of ar events per year was reported for the seus region s easternmost states these regions experience 11 16 ep95p and 3 5 ep99p events per year b the higher number of ar ep events were observed along the northwestern coast of the florida peninsula and south of georgia in addition to that about 3 5 ar ep99p and at least 1 2 ar ep99p events per year are found to occur in the entire eastern part of the seus region seasonal counts of ar ep event occurrences and average precipitation magnitudes showed a pronounced seasonal dependence fifty ar ep95p and twelve ar ep99p events were observed over georgia florida alabama and south carolina during the ond ndj djf jfm fma and mam seasons only a few ar ep events less than 5 10 events are found to occur during the extended warm season months amj to son over the entire seus region on the other hand the average precipitation magnitude of the ar ep95p and ar ep99p events is found to be relatively greater 55 90 mm day in the warm seasons c the evolution of z850 anomalies associated with the cold season ar ep events suggested several troughs and ridge formations across much of the central plains and the gulf coastal plains these regions are characterized by a zone of enhanced geostrophic winds indicating highly anomalous weather conditions on the other hand the warm season anomalies indicated a gradual strengthening of a persistent low pressure system 2 days before the event timings resembling that of cut off lows in the region covering much of the gulf coastal plains that might trigger enhancement of heavy rainfall events in the presence of ars the spatiotemporal evolution of the composite anomalies in mslp associated with the cold season top 100 ar ep events exhibited strengthening of a pressure dipole with an eastward extension of the bermuda high and a high pressure center over the western us d the moisture transport depicted by the composites of the ivt field associated with both the cold and warm season ar ep events are found to mimic the spatiotemporal evolution of the mslp and z850 composites for the respective seasons during the cold warm season ivt intensity gradually strengthens 2 days 5 days 2 days prior to the events and steer over the seus region finally moving up to the atlantic ocean however compared to the cold season the warm season ar eps are associated with relatively weaker ivt strength in addition to that relatively moister conditions were found to be associated with the warm season ar eps which is indicated by significantly higher tcwv anomalies over the affected region the marked increase in moisture availability is attributed to the slowly varying background circulations that favor deep moist convection leading to more severe warm season eps in the region moore et al 2015 nie and fan 2019 such spatiotemporal evolution confirmed the cascading effect of synoptic patterns on the moisture availability and mode of advection associated with ar ep events in the seus region the results from this study are expected to provide adequate understanding and background that will help predict future ar ep events in the seus region the seasonal ar characteristics presented here may be extended further to assess the seasonal water cycle influenced by ars in the region which can significantly aid in the advanced planning and management of water resources related to ars the synoptic meteorological characteristics discussed in this study can be used as important priors to design early warning and management systems related to ar driven floods in the seus future research will aim to address the uncertainties associated with the detection of ars in the region rutz et al 2019 shields et al 2018a the impact of other modes of climate variabilities or if global warming plays a significant role in modulating the statistical behavior or time of emergence of ars in the seus the possible impact of monsoon ridges on the precipitation variability and its coupling with the large scale climate variabilities khedun et al 2014 or the combined impact of occurrence intensity and duration of ars chen et al 2018 can be examined there is also a need to explore the interplay between the ars and other physical mechanisms such as cape

4329,modelling of heterogeneous aquifers such as crystalline aquifers is often difficult and flow and transport predictions are always uncertain suffering of our imperfect knowledge of the spatial distribution of aquifer parameters this paper aims to test the robustness of a first order hydraulic conductivity map estimated from both a detailed water table map and hydraulic conductivity statistics on a granitic watershed in brittany 57 km2 compare it to local estimates and assess it through various numerical models map values range on four orders of magnitude 10 7 to 10 4 m s mean 3 9x10 6 m s and their comparison to local estimates from various sources pumping tests mrs measurements streamflow gives satisfactory results four hydraulic conductivity fields were assessed through numerical modelling under steady state condition model 1 used the regionalized hydraulic conductivity field directly model 2 used a uniform value average of model 1 model 3 used a hydraulic conductivity field obtained by inverse modelling of the water table and model 4 used two zones of uniform values based on the analysis of model 1 and model 3 fields model results were analysed based on their ability to reproduce the observed water table levels and the groundwater flow directions modelled groundwater discharges to streams at sub catchment scale were compared to spatial streamflow measurements performed during low water condition which help validating models the comparison between the fields obtained from model 3 and that from the regionalized method model 1 shows that they are close in terms of mean values and spatial distribution model 1 reproduces rather well the water table map and the groundwater flow directions model 2 shows the less good results model 4 has led to satisfactory results and shows that the hydraulic conductivity is higher 2 1x10 6 m s where the water table is located in the fractured zone and lower 3 3x10 7 m s where it is located in the saprolites highly weathered rock which is expected for such aquifer system modelled groundwater discharges to streams are comparable in all models to streamflow measurements in most sub catchments but the models overestimate them in certain places mainly because of sub surface drains in a forest capturing part of the groundwater that can no longer return to streams drains were not considered in the models in addition experiment on a second watershed 40 km2 shows how with much less field data the methodology can already provide interesting information on the hydraulic conductivity field values and spatial distribution results are very encouraging and open up prospects for using quantitative and qualitative information from the mapping of hydraulic conductivity to constrain the spatialization of hydrodynamic parameters on models and thus our ability to model such complex aquifers keywords regionalization of hydraulic conductivity crystalline aquifers hard rock aquifers modelling 1 introduction nowadays the modelling of groundwater systems is recognized as the best tool to manage and optimize the use of groundwater resources however even if in the last 30 years there has been an increasing number of numerical codes or models softwares more and more sophisticated and able to integrate huge sets of data in order to address a large panel of water related problems flow and transport predictions are still subject to large uncertainties suffering mainly from our imperfect knowledge of aquifer properties though it is relatively easy to evaluate these properties at a local scale for instance deducing hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient from hydraulic tests it is more difficult to assess their variability at the aquifer system scale where spatial variations may occur over several orders of magnitude in crystalline aquifers the regionalization of hydrogeological properties makes the problem much more complex because of their strong natural heterogeneity e g hydraulic conductivity can vary over 12 orders of magnitude tsang et al 1996 hsieh 1998 indeed various degrees in fracturing and connection between fracture networks induce strong variations of properties at all scales e g paillet 1998 maréchal et al 2004 le borgne et al 2004 2006 boutt et al 2010 guihéneuf et al 2014 boisson et al 2015 etc moreover where exposed to deep weathering processes such rocks develop several stratiform layers parallel to the weathering surface layers are mainly a saprolites layer highly weathered parent rocks of low permeability and an overlying fractured layer most permeable in which hydrogeological properties are closely related to the degree of weathering taylor and howard 2000 wyns et al 2004 dewandel et al 2006 lachassagne et al 2011 2021 despite this strong natural heterogeneity even in the latest modelling studies on crystalline aquifers a single property value is assigned to each layer or on large compartments join et al 2005 ahmed and sreedevi 2008 rivard et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2013 leray et al 2013 kolbe et al 2016 2017 durand et al 2017 dewandel et al 2017a dickson et al 2018 bianchi et al 2020 whether built to test conceptual models for the understanding of such complex aquifers to assess the flow distribution or residence times at various scales to evaluate average aquifer properties to predict aquifer productivity or to define a sustainable management of the water resource these studies illustrate our difficulties to introduce the spatial variations of hydrodynamic properties in models few studies have considered the spatial variation of aquifer properties at aquifer scale lubczynski and gurwin 2005 yidana et al 2013 however their results in terms of spatial variations of hydrogeological properties remain unclear sometimes more related to inversion hypothesis modelling hypotheses boundary conditions than to real hydrogeological characteristics despite computer progress these works stress our difficulty in crystalline aquifers or for other type of fractured aquifers to propose realistic hydrogeological properties fields probably due to a lack of robust methodologies for their evaluation prior to modelling it is thus of crucial importance for practical applications to reduce these uncertainties over the past decades various methods combining hydrodynamic parameters geostatistics geological facies inverse modelling techniques geophysical data etc have been proposed for estimating hydraulic conductivity transmissivity or storativity at the scale of groundwater systems e g carrera and neuman 1986 carrera et al 2005 de marsily et al 2005 vermeulen et al 2005 straface et al 2011 illman 2014 however most of these methods require extensive field surveys and were designed for alluvial and sedimentary aquifers in crystalline aquifers a few studies describe the spatial heterogeneity of aquifer parameters and mainly focus on transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity mapping based on data from hydraulic tests razack and lasm 2006 chandra et al 2008 dickson et al 2018 on classified transmissivity i e indexed maps or on potential aquifer zone maps krásný 1993 2000 lachassagne et al 2001 darko and krásný 2007 madrucci et al 2008 dhakate et al 2008 courtois et al 2010 other methods based on hydraulic tomography provide promising results to describe the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient in fractured rocks but also require a large amount of field data illman 2014 more recently other approaches have been proposed based on the concept that large scale variations in hydraulic head may characterize large scale aquifer properties dewandel et al 2012 2017b 2017c in these approaches the regionalization of hydraulic conductivity was based either on statistical relationships between the hydraulic conductivity from small scale tests and linear discharge rates from numerous pumped wells dewandel et al 2012 or on detailed analysis of water table maps in areas where there is no pumping well but with a high density of water table observations dewandel et al 2017b in the absence of recharge from rainfall methods for effective porosity were developed in 2 d for that part of the aquifer where the water table fluctuates dewandel et al 2012 and in 3 d to the entire aquifer thickness while introducing the geometrical structure of the weathering profile dewandel et al 2017c mizan et al 2019 those methods combines at a cell scale water table fluctuation and groundwater budget techniques and an aggregation method these methods for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity were tested on several crystalline aquifers exposed to deep weathering in southern india granites 50 1000 km2 and in new caledonia peridotites 3 5 km2 showing very good estimates when compared to existing field data dewandel et al 2012 2017b 2017c the generated hydrodynamic parameters fields although not intended to be perfectly exact can help identifying the spatial pattern of parameters thus providing valuable information on aquifer heterogeneity although hydrodynamic parameters maps provide new insights to identify potential draining zones to site bore wells or to produce groundwater storage maps that find practical applications for establishing water protection zones and improving groundwater management policies the robustness of the evaluated parameters was not confronted with numerical modelling the objective of this paper is to assess the robustness of a hydraulic conductivity map estimated from both a detailed water table map and hydraulic conductivity statistics on a granitic watershed in brittany nançon watershed 57 km2 france fig 1 a the map which is a first order result has been compared to local estimates deduced from hydraulic tests magnetic resonance soundings and streamflow measurements then the map has been tested with hydrodynamic modelling steady state condition allowing to account for its relevance and to test the sensitivity of the approach carried out several models were tested to explore various ways of using the produced hydraulic conductivity map an original point compared to previous studies is the use of spatial streamflow measurements during the low water period to help validating models in addition it is shown on a second watershed maudouve noë sèche 40 km2 fig 1b how with much less field data the methodology can already provide interesting information on the hydraulic conductivity field the main results for this watershed are presented in the discussion the main information concerning this second watershed is provided as supporting information 2 field data 2 1 location climate and general settings the nançon catchment 57 km2 lies 50 km northeast of rennes city in the brittany region france ille et vilaine department fig 1a the area has a gently rolling relief with elevation ranging between 110 and 230 m a s l meters above sea level fig 1a the region experiences an oceanic climate with mean annual rainfall of 940 mm from which most of them are received from september to april low water period occurs from june to october during this period recharge from rainfall to the aquifers is very low to nil particularly in july and august dewandel et al 2020 this is a rural area where a forest occupies a large part of the south of the watershed fougères forest the exploitation of groundwater is moderate and most of the boreholes are used for agricultural needs livestock farming fig 1a however a few structures exploit groundwater for drinking water supply in particular drains in the forest of fougères these trenches 3 to 5 m deep capture some springs and sub surface flows within the saprolites layer highly weathered superficial material and therefore not the aquifer in the strict sense i e the fractured aquifer they form a dendritic network of about 12 km with poorly known geometry and abstraction e g length and abstraction of each branch the first trenches of which were built in the 17th century the total groundwater abstraction is about 1 46 mm3 year of which 1 31 mm3 year are due to the trenches 2 2 geology the geology of the area is relatively homogeneous and consists of granitic rocks biotite granodiorite to the north and biotite cordierite granodiorite to the south two granodiorites with slightly different mineralogical contents mougin et al 2008 fig 1a to the south of the basin there is but in a very poorly represented way the hornfels schists of fougères which are metamorphosed brioverian schists in the center there is a small tertiary age basin made up of landéan clays sedimentary rocks this will not be the object of spatialization of hydrodynamic properties or of particular modelling crystalline rocks are affected by deep in situ weathering that forms of a saprolites layer and an underlying fractured layer layers fig 2 a b mougin et al 2008 were mapped according to geological log database 64 logs of wells intersecting the bottom of the saprolites brgm french geological survey database and numerous field observations 585 saprolites are very widespread in the watershed and composed of ochre brown clay sands whose facies varies relatively little at the watershed scale their thickness is on average 4 m with locally in plateau area thicknesses exceeding twenty meters fig 2a the underlying fractured layer is on average 35 40 m thick and exceeds 60 m thick in some areas in the valleys it may directly outcrop due to erosion of the overlying saprolites on average at the watershed scale the total weathering profile saprolites fractured zone is around 40 m thick fig 2b a few nnw sse faults compartmentalize the profile giving to the weathering profile a piano key structure shifts induced by faults are nevertheless modest ranging from a few meters to around ten meters 2 3 available hydrogeological data 2 3 1 water table map a water table map fig 3 a was drawn based on groundwater level measurements from 99 wells in august 2017 during the dry season snapshot map therefore in absence of significant rainfall and in absence of recharge from rainfall measurements were carried out on unexploited wells most of the time old wells about ten meters deep reaching the top of the fractured layer these wells are screened both in the saprolites where present and the fractured layer in the area annual water level fluctuations at the watershed scale is about 1 m dewandel et al 2020 in august 2017 water levels were shallow at 1 4 m below ground level on average and are more or less parallel to the topographic surface they are not significantly impacted by pumping wells overall water table lies in the top of the fractured layer on valleys and mainly within the saprolites layer on plateaus in order to provide a relevant mapping variogram based statistics and kriging techniques were used e g razack and lasm 2006 fig 3a c as the aquifer is unconfined absence of an impermeable layer at the aquifer top water table depth were interpolated rather than water table levels moreover as the aquifer is connected to streams eg fig 4 c shows a constant increase of streamflow at the watershed scale because aquifers feed the stream kriging was constrained by streams forcing the groundwater levels to pass through them note that this constraint does not impose a flow direction between the aquifer and the stream for example upstream the aquifer may feed the streams while downstream the streams may recharge the aquifers as mapping was done on water level depth a zero value was imposed on the course of streams then the water table map was obtained by simple difference to dem over a 500x500 m cell grid fig 1a fig 3a this method explains the irregular nature of contour lines but constrains the interpolation to the topography thus avoiding where there is no information the water table of an unconfined aquifer to be above a thalweg or other types of depression the map is representative of the water level condition in the weathering profile saprolites and fractured layers and as established under low water condition no recharge from rainfall it is considered a good approximation of aquifer steady state condition the map was used for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and in numerical modelling 2 3 2 hydraulic conductivity data few pumping test data is available in the area n 5 fig 3b and provides local estimates of the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured layer these hydrogeological data come from the french geological survey database brgm where the basic information concerning hydraulic tests carried out by design and technical offices is stored for the five cases available tests were interpreted with the theis model based on this data hydraulic conductivity ranges between 5x10 7 and 8x10 6 m s 6 3 logk 5 1 mean 5 26 these data fall in the range of the log normal distribution of hydraulic conductivity data deduced from pumping tests of granitoïds at the scale of the brittany region fractured layer fig 3d mean logk 5 4 standard deviation 0 8 brgm database mougin et al 2016 suggesting that this distribution is probably not so far from that of the studied aquifer this distribution was used as training data for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity from the gradient of the residual water table elevation data dewandel et al 2017b section 3 1 although this distribution characterizes the average hydraulic conductivity of the fractured layer the hydraulic conductivities of the less permeable saprolites layer are also in this range mainly in its left part since they are generally in granitic areas between 10 7 and 10 5 m s dewandel et al 2006 this is why this dataset is used to regionalize the hydraulic conductivity from the water table level of the whole weathering profile saprolites and fractured layers however the numerical modelling carried out subsequently will make it possible to evaluate the bias introduced by the use of this distribution local data n 5 were also compared to local estimates of the produced hydraulic conductivity map sixteen magnetic resonance soundings mrs were carried out to improve local data on hydrogeological properties mougin et al 2008 dewandel et al 2020 fig 3b mrs measurements were carried out from the ground surface with the numis poly equipment from iris instruments bernard 2007 with mainly 8 shape square loops for reducing noise level trushkin et al 1994 thirty eight to fifty meter loop size and adapted number of stack ensure liable mrs signal to a maximum investigation depth of about 50 m with signal to noise ratio of 1 4 to 3 5 inversion of mrs measurements were carried out with samovar 11x64 software legtchenko 2013 using a multi layered earth model without geological constraints and automatic regularization process inversion results give estimates of the mrs groundwater content and mrs hydraulic conductivity as a function of depth from which the aquifer porosity and hydraulic conductivity can be deduced wyns et al 2004 vouillamoz et al 2014 fig 4a gives an example of the hydrogeological parameters deduced from mrs in crystalline aquifers vouillamoz et al 2014 showed that mrs porosity needs to be corrected by a factor of about 0 5 to be equivalent that deduced from pumping tests however they showed that the transmissivity and the hydraulic conductivity obtained by the mrs method was very close to that deduced from pumping tests no correction has therefore been made to these data from the sixteen mrs measurements logk values for the fractured layer vary from 5 7 to 3 7 with an average of 4 8 standard deviation 0 6 fig 4b in the range of the previous distribution of hydraulic conductivity these local estimates were also compared to local estimates of the hydraulic conductivity map produced 2 3 3 streamflow measurements at the same time as water level measurements in august 2017 twenty two stream flowrate measurements were performed fig 3b the measurements being carried out under the same low water conditions no recharge by rainfall they correspond to the discharge of groundwater into streams they were performed with an ott flowmeter propeller diameter 50 mm flowrates range from 0 001 m3 s for small catchment area less than1 km2 to 0 13 m3 s at the outlet of the watershed 57 km2 in area plotted according to watershed area fig 4c flowrate increases approximately linearly showing that the aquifer continuously feeds the streams as for water level measurements flowrate values because of low water conditions are assumed to represent a good approximate of aquifer steady state conditions combined with water table map and catchment characteristics i e length of stream area flow values are used for estimating basin scale hydraulic conductivity of each sub catchment dewandel et al 2004 see appendix a values range in logk between 5 7 and 4 9 with an average of 5 3 standard deviation 0 25 fig 4d values are still in the range of the distribution of hydraulic conductivity deduced from pumping tests at the scale of the brittany region fig 3d these basin scale hydraulic conductivity values were compared with those estimated by the regionalization method and flowrates were compared with those computed by numerical modelling 3 methods following dewandel et al 2017b methodology a regionalized hydraulic conductivity map was produced from which values have been compared to local estimates deduced from hydraulic tests mrs measurements and streamflow measurements then the map a first order estimate of the hydraulic conductivity field has been assessed with several hydrodynamic models steady state condition to account for various ways of using the produced map of which spatial streamflow measurements are used for validating models 3 1 method for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity the used method has been recently proposed for evaluating the transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity fields in a crystalline aquifer dewandel et al 2017b and is briefly reminded here it is based on the concept that large scale variations in hydraulic head may give information on large scale hydrodynamic properties where the aquifer is naturally drained no groundwater abstraction where vertical flow can be neglected and where the water table is in pseudo steady state and mainly controlled by topography rather than recharge haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 it can be assumed that the gradient of the water table depends on both topographic slope and aquifer horizontal transmissivity for example in case of relatively flat topography and where groundwater flow is horizontal the use of continuity equation along the same flow line for unit aquifer width darcy s law q t1gradh1 t2gradh2 ti transmissivity and gradhi hydraulic head gradient of compartment i will give high transmissivity values where the hydraulic gradient is low and low values where the gradient is high therefore where the topographic level is almost stable the hydraulic gradient variations are in first approximation inversely related to variations in aquifer transmissivity on the other hand in the case where the topographic variations are not negligible it is necessary before obtaining information on the transmissivity to remove the influence of the topography on the water table elevation by subtracting to it for example a linear water table topography relationship once this trend removed the inverse slope of the residual water table map is computed and then statistically compared to local transmissivity data to produce a transmissivity field the latter can be finally transformed into hydraulic conductivity if information on the thickness of the aquifer is available dewandel et al 2017b then the best possible empirical relationship between the two statistical distributions transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity measured and calculated from the gradient is evaluated while respecting the statistical properties of the transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity measured for the analysis to be meaningful both data sets must describe the widest possible range of transmissivities that can be encountered in the studied aquifer finally the calculated transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity is spatialized and the relevance of the map produced is evaluated on the basis of local estimates of transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity this is relevant because these measurements are not directly included in the mapping method only their statistical distribution one of the assumptions made by the method is that vertical flow is neglected while fractured rocks as here can be affected by sub vertical fractures that allow vertical flow components however in such a granitic weathering profile the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured layer due to a denser horizontal network is about 10 times higher horizontally than vertically maréchal et al 2004 lachassagne et al 2021 which thus promotes horizontal flows in addition as the method uses a basin to sub basin scale approach and that the aquifer thickness is small a few ten meters compared to the sub basin scale km scale then at this scale horizontal flows dominate e g guihéneuf et al 2014 kolbe et al 2016 ayraud et al 2008 which is another argument to use the method here however when the vertical component of the flow exists and is not negligible this can occur locally along the fault for example the method may return falsely lower transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity values but the method still delineates the shape of these areas dewandel et al 2017b the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map of nançon watershed is based on i the inverse gradient of the established water table map fig 3a that was reduced from topographic effect i e inverse gradient of the reduced water table map divided by the aquifer thickness to make data consistent with hydraulic conductivity and ii the regional based statistical relationship for hydraulic conductivity fig 3d the use of this latest relationship instead of a local one because of too little data from hydraulic tests will be discussed later the map was established over a grid of 500x500 m cells and integrates hydraulic conductivity values theoretically horizontal k of the whole weathering profile saprolites and fractured layers however since the fractured layer is the most permeable layer in the weathering profile the map better reflects the hydraulic conductivity of this layer then the map was compared to local hydraulic conductivity estimates pumping tests fig 3b mrs measurements fig 4b and streamflow measurements fig 4d 3 2 numerical modelling assessment of the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map of nançon granitic aquifer was performed by numerical modelling nançon hydrological model was developed using the marthe 7 4 brgm computer code thiéry 2010 2015 thiéry et al 2018 marthe allows 2d or 3d modelling of flows and mass transfers in aquifer systems including climatic and human influences groundwater flow is computed by a 3 d finite volume approach to solve the hydrodynamic equation based on the darcy s law and mass conservation the model comprises a single aquifer layer that merges both saprolites and fractured layers to be consistent with the hydraulic conductivity field obtained from the regionalization method aquifer geometry was established from the dem model fig 1a and the total weathering thickness map fig 2b the small tertiary age basin located in the centre of the watershed landéan clays was not considered in the modelling the modelled domain is discretized into cells of 500x500 metres to be consistent with other data sources a no flow boundary condition is applied to the watershed limits in agreement with the established water table map fig 3a on the other hand groundwater overflow is allowed where the water table surface crosscuts topographic level for the purpose of this study the model does not explicitly take into account the flow in the streams avoiding thus imposed stream boundary conditions that would force the model to evacuate flow through the streams however the model makes possible to compute the groundwater overflow at cell scale i e the groundwater discharge to streams which were compared to streamflow measurements fig 3b 4c in this way streamflow measurements were also used to assess model results geological faults fig 1a and 2 were not considered in the model as they do not influence the water table map fig 3a a homogeneous recharge at the basin scale was applied to the model 96 mm year that corresponds to the streamflow rate measured at the outlet of the watershed in august 2017 during the low flow condition 127 l s fig 4c and the groundwater abstraction at the watershed scale 46 2 l s in terms of groundwater abstraction the model includes those of exploited wells total 18 6 m3 h or 5 2 l s but not the drains in the fougères forest which capture some springs and sub surface flows total 41 l s these drains represent a loss for streamflow computations were performed in steady state condition output of the models were the water balance at the watershed scale the water table map and the groundwater discharges to streams four hydraulic conductivity field models were assessed model 1 used directly the hydraulic conductivity field obtained by the regionalization method section 3 1 model 2 assumed a uniform hydraulic conductivity value mean value of the previous map to go further in the analysis investigations were performed to evaluate if zones of constant hydraulic conductivity emerged from the spatial distribution of the obtained field the geomorphology and or the geology for that purpose an automatic calibration of the hydraulic conductivity field based on head gradient method thiéry 1993 has been achieved from the water table map model 3 this inverted hydraulic conductivity field has been compared to the one deduced from the regionalization method then the inverted field was used to identify two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity whose values are obtained by automatic optimization thiéry 1994 model 4 the results of the four models were analysed based on three criteria i the ability of the model to reproduce the groundwater flow direction at the catchment scale ii the difference between the modelled water table and that observed i e fig 3a and iii the difference between the modelled overflow and the streamflow measurements at the scale of sub catchments i e fig 4c 4 results 4 1 regionalized hydraulic conductivity map figs 5 and 6 show the results of the regionalisation method fig 5a displays the relationship between the elevation and the water table level from which the reduced water table map and its gradient are produced fig 5b shows the statistical distribution of the inverse gradient of the reduced water table divided by the aquifer thickness 1 slope aqui thick in log scale and fig 5c the corresponding map in log scale fig 5d presents the variogram of the map according to the method proposed the best statistical relationship between the two log normal distributions logk from the granitoïds of brittany fig 3d and log 1 slope aqui thick fig 5b is k comp 2 72x10 7x 1 slope aqui thick 2 9x10 6 where k comp is the hydraulic conductivity computed the correlation coefficient between both distributions is r2 0 96 fig 6b although empirical this relationship partly satisfies darcy s law because it assumes a linear relationship between hydraulic conductivity and gradient the constant 2 9x10 6 low compared to the other parameters reflects that some extreme values could not be taken into account mainly extremely low gradient values possibly due to some errors in water table level interpolation these extreme values correspond to approximately 10 of the data this constant may also show the limit of the method for evaluating hydraulic conductivity values on singular high permeable areas and where vertical groundwater flow dominates nonetheless the geometry of these areas can still be assessed fig 6a shows the hydraulic conductivity map deduced from the regionalisation approach established on a 500x500 m cell grid the variographic analysis of logk computed shows that data is moderately structured in space nugget effect greater than 50 of the total variance fig 6c the sill is about 3000 m showing that sectors of similar hydraulic conductivity cover areas of few km2 hydraulic conductivity ranges on four orders of magnitude 10 7 to 10 4 m s with an average value at the watershed scale of about 4x10 6 m s while this map does not claim to be accurate a first order result it allows identifying areas more permeable than others overall values are high in valleys where the water table lies in the fractured layer and low where the water table is in the saprolites layer mainly plateaus fig 2a however for sectors where there are no water level measurements e g forest of fougères near na11a and nan04 mrs points on fig 6a the values have to be considered with caution the resulting map has been compared to local estimates of hydraulic conductivities deduced from pumping tests 5 values see appendix fig b it shows a mean absolute error of 8 0 i e an estimate of the map at 0 43 in logk absolute error abs logk comp logk pump test logk pump test compared to the hydraulic conductivities estimated from mrs measurements 16 values for the fractured layer see appendix fig b the mean relative deviation is 12 5 i e 0 64 in logk in this case calculating the relative deviation to the mean was preferred relative deviation 2xabs logk comp logk mrs logk comp logk mrs as the hydraulic conductivities deduced from mrs measurements are indirect estimates and not direct estimates as from hydraulic tests finally hydraulic conductivity values estimated at sub catchment scale from streamflow measurements were compared to the average map values of the corresponding areas n 22 see appendix fig b the mean relative deviation is 7 6 which corresponds to 0 43 in logk all these comparisons show that the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map provides reliable estimates now the objective is to test its relevance and its sensitivity through numerical modelling 4 2 numerical modelling figs 7 and 8 present the results of the four models in terms of modelled water table and groundwater flow direction location and values of overflows and scattered diagrams table 1 synthesizes the statistical criteria on water table levels at watershed scale and fig 9 compares the model overflows and streamflow measurements at the sub catchment scale 4 2 1 model with the regionalized hydraulic conductivity field model 1 this model used directly the hydraulic conductivity field obtained by the regionalization method fig 6a the model closely reproduces the water table map in terms of order of magnitude fig 7a groundwater flow directions obtained by the model are consistent with those of the water table map fig 7a except for a few sectors i e fougères forest where the model does not show a drainage of the water table by streams however in these sectors as well as at the outlet of the watershed the water table map is not reliable due to the lack of water table measurements like the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map consequently modelled water levels are largely underestimated with differences exceeding 20 m and locally 30 m at the outlet of the watershed fig 7b this result means that the regionalization method tends to overestimate the hydraulic conductivity in those areas elsewhere the differences are smaller and vary between 14 m and 6 5 m with an average bias of 2 m bias difference between modelled and observed water table this underestimation is confirmed by the scatter diagram presented in fig 8a and by the statistical criteria values table 1 the root mean squared error rmse at the watershed scale is 7 1 m nonetheless if data from the sectors of the fougères forest and at the outlet i e 32 cells out of 243 are removed from this analysis the rmse obtained is 3 7 m which is without any optimisation on model parameters a good result apart from the upstream zone of the fougères forest where the model cannot compute overflow because of too low modelled water levels the groundwater overflowing map fig 7c shows a behaviour in accordance with the aquifer functioning the overflow occurs mainly along streams computed groundwater discharges to streams of the sub catchments are compared to available streamflow measurements fig 9 overall flows are comparable for the upstream catchments located to the north the east and the south west e g bv1 bv2 bv5 bv8 bv13 and bv15 on the other hand for the sub catchments bv4 and bv16 the computed groundwater discharges to streams overestimates measured values of about 30 l s with repercussions for bv4 on downstream points along the stream bv7 bv9 bv18 these differences can be explained by unknown exploited wells in these areas but most probably because of its order of magnitude from part of the groundwater flow collected by the drains located in the forest of fougères drains being not considered in the model that cannot reach the streams total abstraction of drains 41 l s some upstream parts of these sub catchments taking place in this forest therefore the flow measurements in these areas are most likely reduced from the abstraction of drains 4 2 2 model with a uniform hydraulic conductivity value model 2 in order to assess the benefit of the hydraulic conductivity field proposed by the regionalization method this second model uses a uniform hydraulic conductivity value at the watershed scale which is the average value of regionalized field 3 9x10 6 m s fig 7e shows that the water level deviation is 3 m on the valleys but the water table is largely underestimated on the plateaus and some dry valleys 15 20 m the trends are similar to model 1 however according to the statistical criteria established for the two models table 1 the results obtained using the regionalized hydraulic conductivity field are better in terms of bias rmse etc results on overflows are similar to the one of the model 1 fig 9 4 2 3 model with two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity values models 3 and 4 4 2 3 1 inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field model 3 using marthe s code thiéry 1993 an automatic inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field was performed from the observed water table map fig 3a by constraining the model with the extreme hydraulic conductivity values obtained by the regionalization method min 6x10 8 m s max 7x10 5 m s the inversion method is based on hydraulic head gradients approach and consists in adjusting in each cell of the model the value of the hydraulic conductivity to reduce the error between the computed head and the measured one as an initial value for the inversion the hydraulic conductivity is assumed uniform over the entire domain and corresponds to the mean value tested in model 2 k 3 9 x10 6 m s fig 10 a and b show the hydraulic conductivity field obtained by inverse modelling and their statistical distribution in logk the distribution of the inverted field is fairly homogeneous with more than 95 of values between 6x10 6 m s and 6x10 7 m s the minimum value is 2x10 7 m s maximum 1 8x10 5 m s and the average 1 4x10 6 m s which is lower than that of the regionalized field 3 9x10 6 m s 65 of the values are in the range 1 2x10 6 3 3x10 6 m s and 30 in the range 3x10 7 8x10 7 m s and are overall higher on the valleys than on the plateaus as previously observed fig 1a the comparison between this map and the one from the regionalization method is discussed later the statistical criteria established for this model are naturally good fig 8c table 1 the bias and the rmse on water table are 0 7 m and 1 7 m respectively the computed groundwater discharges to streams of the water table of sub catchments are compared to local measurements fig 9 values are comparable for many sub basins e g bv1 bv2 bv5 bv8 bv13 and bv15 for bv4 a significant flow difference is still observed 29 l s which also affects downstream points bv7 bv9 bv18 the possible explanations of these differences are those given above 4 2 3 2 model with two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity model 4 based on the distribution of the inverted field fig 10b two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity were defined zone 1 and zone 2 fig 10c zone 1 generally corresponds to the valleys where the fractured layer outcrops and zone 2 coincides with the upstream part of sub catchments and plateaus as well as zones with a significant thickness of saprolites excepted in the fougères forest note that this zoning between the most permeable areas on the valleys and the least permeable on the plateaus was already visible on the hydraulic conductivity map resulting from the regionalization method fig 6a finally an automatic optimization of the hydraulic conductivity values of the two zones was carried out with marthe s code this optimization was constrained by the following hydraulic conductivity values for zone 1 10 6 m s 2x10 5 m s and for zone 2 10 8 m s 9x10 7 m s resulting uniform hydraulic conductivities are 2 1x10 6 m s for zone 1 and 3 3x10 7 m s for zone 2 therefore higher where the water table is located in the fractured layer and lower where it is in the saprolites the scatter diagram fig 8d shows that the model reproduces the observed water table well with very satisfactory statistical criteria table 1 at the watershed scale the bias is 0 67 m and the rsme is 1 8 m thus very close to the model using the inverted hydraulic conductivity field model 3 results on groundwater discharges to streams at sub catchment scale are similar to the previous models fig 9 5 discussion 5 1 regionalized hydraulic conductivity despite the restrictive hypotheses assumed in the regionalization method vertical flow neglected absence of pumping wells water table in pseudo steady state and controlled by topography the resulting regionalized hydraulic conductivity field on the nançon watershed shows consistent results compared to other available data sources pumping tests estimates from mrs measurements and from streamflows at sub catchment scale it also appears that the hypothesis which neglects the vertical flow did not introduce a significant bias at the watershed scale this is mainly due to the thinness of the aquifer compared to the groundwater flow lines at the watershed scale which limits vertical flow components at this scale guihéneuf et al 2014 kolbe et al 2016 ayraud et al 2008 the comparisons with local hydraulic conductivity estimates show also that despite the lack of local available hydraulic data for evaluating a clear distribution of hydraulic conductivity at the watershed scale the use of the training distribution from the granitoïds of brittany provides a satisfactory result although defined for the fractured layer only in addition the map also shows good consistency with the mrs estimates which confirms previous works vouillamoz et al 2014 hydraulic conductivity ranges on four orders of magnitude 10 7 to 10 4 m s average 3 9x10 6 m s which is consistent to other works performed on granitic aquifers e g maréchal et al 2004 dewandel et al 2012 furthermore it confirms that where granitic rocks are exposed to deep weathering processes aquifers are characterized by similar ranges of hydrogeological properties dewandel et al 2006 lachassagne et al 2011 2021 which facilitates and justifies the use of training data in the absence of sufficient local data as it was done here although the method does not claim to be perfectly accurate the produced map a first order result describes the spatial heterogeneity and shows that sectors of similar hydraulic conductivity cover areas of the order of few km2 as indicated previously a certain consistency is found with the geological information as on the whole the values are the highest where the water table lies in the fractured layer mainly valleys and the lowest in areas where the water table is the saprolites layer mainly plateaus fig 11 compares the field obtained from the inverse modelling model 3 to that proposed by the regionalization method the average relative deviation is 2 5 with a mean deviation less than or equal to 5 over 93 of the whole area which corresponds to logk 0 29 this shows that the regionalization method made it possible to propose a spatial pattern of the hydraulic conductivity field relatively close to that obtained by the inverse modelling in addition fig 11a illustrates that as soon as the density of water table measurements is sufficient the method provides relatively robust estimates deviation of less than 3 5 over 75 of the basin i e logk 0 20 however where the density of field data decreases e g fougères forest outlet of the watershed the estimates of the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map but also the map resulting from the inverse modelling logically become more erroneous this point on data density is addressed below through an experiment performed on the maudouve noë sèche watershed 5 2 modelling the suitability of the four sets of hydraulic conductivity field was assessed the regionalized field model 1 an uniform field model 2 average value of the previous model the one deduced from inverse modelling model 3 and the last with two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity model 4 defined from the previous one overall and depending on the models the observed water table is more or less well reproduced with uncertainties in the fougères forest and at the outlet of the basin due to the lack of field data the simulated groundwater discharges to streams are comparable to measurements made in many sub catchments however the models generally overestimate the stream flows in some places this can be explained one the one hand by a lack of knowledge about the pumping wells influence possibly underestimated but most likely on the second hand by the drains in the fougères forest not considered in models capturing part of the groundwater that can no longer return to streams total abstraction from drains 41 l s the model using the regionalized field directly model 1 reproduces rather well the water table map and the groundwater flow directions except in the fougères forest due to the lack of data considering all the assumptions involved in the regionalization method this is already a good result however modelled water table levels are in average underestimated which can be explained by the use of the training distribution hydraulic conductivity database from granitoids of brittany and not from values of the studied watershed it is therefore possible that the mean of this latter distribution may be greater than that of the nançon watershed what is ultimately suggested by the fields resulting from the numerical inversion and optimization of models 3 and 4 k average model 1 3 9x10 6 m s model 3 1 4x10 6 m s model 4 1 3x10 6 m s this difference can also be explained by the use of a training distribution defined for the fractured layer while the regionalized map is deduced from information on the entire weathering profile thus integrating the less permeable saprolites layer the model using an average value of hydraulic conductivity at the watershed scale model 2 shows similar trends to the model 1 underestimation of the water table although its statistical criteria are less good note that this model is derived from the regionalized model and if the average hydraulic conductivity of the pumping tests had been used the water table would have been even more underestimated average of 5 data 5 5x10 6 m s the relative success of this model is probably explained by the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity that is characterized by set of small areas few km2 with homogeneous values this leads to a relatively randomized and homogeneous pattern of the hydraulic conductivity field at the watershed scale which explains the constant increase of flow groundwater flow along streams fig 4c this underlines the relatively homogenous character of such aquifers at the scale of watersheds of a few ten km2 allowing approximating them by a porous medium and thus prescribing uniform hydraulic conductivity values to each layers or compartments to provide reliable estimates of the water table and flow distribution join et al 2005 rivard et al 2008 leray et al 2013 kolbe et al 2016 2017 durand et al 2017 mclaren et al 2012 dickson et al 2018 for models 3 and 4 the regionalized field was used to constrain the inverted hydraulic conductivity fields the model with two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity model 4 was based on the distribution of hydraulic conductivity deduced from the inverse modelling of the water table map model 3 nonetheless these areas or at least areas of similar shapes could have been defined directly from the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map more permeable in valleys and mainly the low permeable on plateaus the use of this two zone field the hydraulic conductivity of which is obtained by an automatic optimization method has led to very satisfactory results rmse 1 8 m very close to that of the inverted field at the watershed scale model 3 this result is explained as for the results of model 2 by the relative homogeneity of the aquifer layers properties at the km scale model 3 confirms that as expected the mean hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is higher where the water table is located in the fractured zone valleys and lower where it is located in the saprolites plateaus this result is very encouraging and opens prospects for using qualitative information to constrain the spatialization of hydrodynamic parameters therefore the combined use of the regionalization method for defining zones and hydraulic conductivity ranges and the numerical inversion made it possible to reduce the uncertainties of the hydraulic conductivity field 5 3 application on areas with much less field data in order to test the sensitivity of our approach on areas with a lesser amount of data similar experiments were carried out on the maudouve noë sèche watershed brittany region côte d armor dept france fig 1b similarly to the nançon area a regionalized hydraulic conductivity map was produced and assessed through numerical modelling here only the regionalized field similar to the model 1 in nançon has been evaluated with the objective of assessing whether with less data on the water table it is possible to produce realistic results only the main results are presented here more information is provided as supporting information the area corresponds to two contiguous catchments the maudouve 30 km2 and the noë sèche 10 km2 the geological context of the area is more contrasted compared to that of the nançon basin and consists of granitoïds of various types mainly granites and migmatites rocks are also deeply weathered but the saprolites layer has been largely eroded thickness a few metres to ten metres and the underlying fractured layer is on average 40 m thick a water table map was drawn for august 2018 using the same technic as described above but using measurements on 33 abandoned wells only fig 12 a water levels are shallow at 0 7 m below ground level on average more or less parallel to the topographic surface based on this map and the hydraulic conductivity distribution of granitoïds of brittany fig 3d a regionalized hydraulic conductivity map was built fig 12b map values cover four orders of magnitude 10 7 to 10 4 m s with an average value at the watershed scale of 2 8x10 6 m s close to the one evaluated for the nançon area its comparison to the few available local estimates shows relatively consistent results from pumping tests mean absolute error 16 9 logk 0 83 n 3 but all located in the same area from mrs measurements mean relative deviation 4 5 logk 0 25 n 7 available within the watershed and from streamflow measurements mean relative deviation 6 1 logk 0 33 n 8 similarly to the nançon area the numerical model considers the topography the geometry of the weathering profile and the abstraction of exploited wells total 8 5 m3 h or 2 4 l s model boundary conditions are no flow boundary at the watershed limits and homogeneous recharge at the scale of each watershed noë sèche 160 mm and maudouve 120 mm with respect to the streamflow rates measured at the outlets of watersheds and groundwater abstraction computations were performed on a 500x500 m cell grid and model results were analysed based on the same criteria as before fig 12 c and d presents the results of this modelling the modelled water table map reproduces fairly well the observed map fig 12 d bias 2 9 m rmse 6 5 m and computed groundwater discharges to streams are consistent with streamflow measurements fig 12 c excepted at the outlet of the maudouve watershed where the record at the gauging station is possibly underestimated no field discharge measurement was performed there these results confirm that the use of the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map gives satisfactory results despite a density of water table data 0 8 pts km2 two times lower compared to nançon watershed 1 74 pts km2 however as for the nançon area the regionalization method tends to overestimate the hydraulic conductivity values modelled water table lower than measured fig 12d probably because of the hydraulic conductivity distribution used brittany fig 3d defined for the fractured layer while the regionalized map is deduced from information on the entire weathering profile finally the presented results show that with a density of water table measurements of about 1 measurement per km2 and few streamflow measurements during low water conditions it is possible to obtain a relatively robust first order assessment of the hydraulic conductivity field 6 conclusion modelling of groundwater resources in crystalline aquifers is often difficult mainly because of the strong spatial heterogeneity of aquifer parameters the evaluation of the regionalized hydraulic conductivity maps with numerical models in steady state condition made it possible to report their relevance and to test the sensitivity of the approach carried out on two granitic watersheds in brittany nançon watershed 57 km2 and maudouve noë sèche 40 km2 on nançon watershed the model using directly the regionalized field model 1 reproduces rather well the water table map and the groundwater flow directions except in the fougères forest due to the lack of data rmse on the water table levels is 7 1 m over the entire domain but decreases to 3 7 m when sectors where no water level measurements are excluded however simulated water table levels are in average underestimated this can be explained by the use of a training distribution hydraulic conductivity database from granitoids of brittany and not one established from values obtained on the studied watershed but also because this distribution is defined for the fractured layer while the regionalized map is deduced from the information on the entire weathering profile both saprolites and fractured layers consequently the regionalized field moderately overestimates the average aquifer hydraulic conductivity 3 9x10 6 instead of 1 4x10 6 m s the comparison between the field obtained from the inverse modelling model 3 and that proposed by the regionalization method model 1 shows that both fields are close in terms of mean values and spatial distribution mean deviation between the two fields is 2 5 logk 0 14 this highlights that as soon as sufficient information is available on the water table it is possible to propose a relatively robust hydraulic conductivity map at the watershed scale the model 2 uniform field shows similar trends but statistical criteria are significantly less good particularly on plateau areas finally the model 4 a 2 zone hydraulic conductivity field has led to satisfactory results rmse 1 8 m which underlines as model 2 the relatively homogenous character of such aquifers at a km scale this model model 3 shows that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is higher 2 1x10 6 m s where the water table is located in the fractured zone valleys and lower 3 3x10 7 m s where it is located in the saprolites plateaus what is ultimately expected in all models the computed groundwater discharges to streams of the water table are comparable to the streamflows measured in most sub catchments however the models overestimate them in certain places which can be due to the lack of knowledge on pumping wells but mainly to the drains in the forest of fougères that capture part of the groundwater flow which can no longer return to the streams for the maudouve noë sèche watershed the modelled water table map based on the regionalized field reproduce fairly well the observed map bias 2 9 m rmse 6 5 m and computed groundwater overflows are overall consistent with streamflow measurements the regionalization method makes it possible to produce a first order assessment of the hydraulic conductivity field which shows a good consistency with local hydraulic conductivity estimates is able to describe zones with high and low values and when used in a numerical model reproduces rather well the water table map the groundwater flow directions and groundwater discharges to streams even if one can doubt the reality of the estimated value at a given point the regionalized field can be taken as an advantage for carrying out a relatively robust modelling with the creation of zones of different hydraulic conductivity from ranges of values given by the map e g model 4 on nançon watershed the other advantage of the regionalization method is that unlike the inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field by mathematical models it is not necessary to prescribe a recharge or other boundary conditions conditions often difficult to estimate or even geometry of aquifers in this case only a regionalization of aquifer transmissivity is possible thus many conditions that can influence the hydraulic conductivity field obtained from the inversion the joint use of the regionalization method and the numerical inversion therefore makes it possible to reduce the uncertainties of models to go further it would be interesting to test these approaches on other watersheds and in particular larger watersheds of the order of 1000 km2 or more then arises the question to define the density of the measurements required in terms for example of water table measurements or number of hydraulic tests to reasonably use the method for the maudouve noë sèche watershed the density of water table measurements for establishing the regionalized field was around half 0 8 pt km2 the one of nançon area 1 74 pt km2 the results are naturally less precise but already give an idea of the distribution of hydraulic conductivities at the watershed scale this is an essential point on which future works must focus another point will concern areas with a highly contrasted hydraulic conductivity field or within complex aquifer systems i e with zones characterized by very contrasted properties and even in depth the regionalization method should be repeated for each area or depth interval provided that the hydraulic conductivity distributions of each zone here one layer model has been used for reproducing the water table map efforts should be made in the future to generate 3 d hydraulic conductivity field which will allow to integrate the 3 d structures of these aquifers i e saprolites and fractured layers and thus improve of our models

4329,modelling of heterogeneous aquifers such as crystalline aquifers is often difficult and flow and transport predictions are always uncertain suffering of our imperfect knowledge of the spatial distribution of aquifer parameters this paper aims to test the robustness of a first order hydraulic conductivity map estimated from both a detailed water table map and hydraulic conductivity statistics on a granitic watershed in brittany 57 km2 compare it to local estimates and assess it through various numerical models map values range on four orders of magnitude 10 7 to 10 4 m s mean 3 9x10 6 m s and their comparison to local estimates from various sources pumping tests mrs measurements streamflow gives satisfactory results four hydraulic conductivity fields were assessed through numerical modelling under steady state condition model 1 used the regionalized hydraulic conductivity field directly model 2 used a uniform value average of model 1 model 3 used a hydraulic conductivity field obtained by inverse modelling of the water table and model 4 used two zones of uniform values based on the analysis of model 1 and model 3 fields model results were analysed based on their ability to reproduce the observed water table levels and the groundwater flow directions modelled groundwater discharges to streams at sub catchment scale were compared to spatial streamflow measurements performed during low water condition which help validating models the comparison between the fields obtained from model 3 and that from the regionalized method model 1 shows that they are close in terms of mean values and spatial distribution model 1 reproduces rather well the water table map and the groundwater flow directions model 2 shows the less good results model 4 has led to satisfactory results and shows that the hydraulic conductivity is higher 2 1x10 6 m s where the water table is located in the fractured zone and lower 3 3x10 7 m s where it is located in the saprolites highly weathered rock which is expected for such aquifer system modelled groundwater discharges to streams are comparable in all models to streamflow measurements in most sub catchments but the models overestimate them in certain places mainly because of sub surface drains in a forest capturing part of the groundwater that can no longer return to streams drains were not considered in the models in addition experiment on a second watershed 40 km2 shows how with much less field data the methodology can already provide interesting information on the hydraulic conductivity field values and spatial distribution results are very encouraging and open up prospects for using quantitative and qualitative information from the mapping of hydraulic conductivity to constrain the spatialization of hydrodynamic parameters on models and thus our ability to model such complex aquifers keywords regionalization of hydraulic conductivity crystalline aquifers hard rock aquifers modelling 1 introduction nowadays the modelling of groundwater systems is recognized as the best tool to manage and optimize the use of groundwater resources however even if in the last 30 years there has been an increasing number of numerical codes or models softwares more and more sophisticated and able to integrate huge sets of data in order to address a large panel of water related problems flow and transport predictions are still subject to large uncertainties suffering mainly from our imperfect knowledge of aquifer properties though it is relatively easy to evaluate these properties at a local scale for instance deducing hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient from hydraulic tests it is more difficult to assess their variability at the aquifer system scale where spatial variations may occur over several orders of magnitude in crystalline aquifers the regionalization of hydrogeological properties makes the problem much more complex because of their strong natural heterogeneity e g hydraulic conductivity can vary over 12 orders of magnitude tsang et al 1996 hsieh 1998 indeed various degrees in fracturing and connection between fracture networks induce strong variations of properties at all scales e g paillet 1998 maréchal et al 2004 le borgne et al 2004 2006 boutt et al 2010 guihéneuf et al 2014 boisson et al 2015 etc moreover where exposed to deep weathering processes such rocks develop several stratiform layers parallel to the weathering surface layers are mainly a saprolites layer highly weathered parent rocks of low permeability and an overlying fractured layer most permeable in which hydrogeological properties are closely related to the degree of weathering taylor and howard 2000 wyns et al 2004 dewandel et al 2006 lachassagne et al 2011 2021 despite this strong natural heterogeneity even in the latest modelling studies on crystalline aquifers a single property value is assigned to each layer or on large compartments join et al 2005 ahmed and sreedevi 2008 rivard et al 2008 goderniaux et al 2013 leray et al 2013 kolbe et al 2016 2017 durand et al 2017 dewandel et al 2017a dickson et al 2018 bianchi et al 2020 whether built to test conceptual models for the understanding of such complex aquifers to assess the flow distribution or residence times at various scales to evaluate average aquifer properties to predict aquifer productivity or to define a sustainable management of the water resource these studies illustrate our difficulties to introduce the spatial variations of hydrodynamic properties in models few studies have considered the spatial variation of aquifer properties at aquifer scale lubczynski and gurwin 2005 yidana et al 2013 however their results in terms of spatial variations of hydrogeological properties remain unclear sometimes more related to inversion hypothesis modelling hypotheses boundary conditions than to real hydrogeological characteristics despite computer progress these works stress our difficulty in crystalline aquifers or for other type of fractured aquifers to propose realistic hydrogeological properties fields probably due to a lack of robust methodologies for their evaluation prior to modelling it is thus of crucial importance for practical applications to reduce these uncertainties over the past decades various methods combining hydrodynamic parameters geostatistics geological facies inverse modelling techniques geophysical data etc have been proposed for estimating hydraulic conductivity transmissivity or storativity at the scale of groundwater systems e g carrera and neuman 1986 carrera et al 2005 de marsily et al 2005 vermeulen et al 2005 straface et al 2011 illman 2014 however most of these methods require extensive field surveys and were designed for alluvial and sedimentary aquifers in crystalline aquifers a few studies describe the spatial heterogeneity of aquifer parameters and mainly focus on transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity mapping based on data from hydraulic tests razack and lasm 2006 chandra et al 2008 dickson et al 2018 on classified transmissivity i e indexed maps or on potential aquifer zone maps krásný 1993 2000 lachassagne et al 2001 darko and krásný 2007 madrucci et al 2008 dhakate et al 2008 courtois et al 2010 other methods based on hydraulic tomography provide promising results to describe the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient in fractured rocks but also require a large amount of field data illman 2014 more recently other approaches have been proposed based on the concept that large scale variations in hydraulic head may characterize large scale aquifer properties dewandel et al 2012 2017b 2017c in these approaches the regionalization of hydraulic conductivity was based either on statistical relationships between the hydraulic conductivity from small scale tests and linear discharge rates from numerous pumped wells dewandel et al 2012 or on detailed analysis of water table maps in areas where there is no pumping well but with a high density of water table observations dewandel et al 2017b in the absence of recharge from rainfall methods for effective porosity were developed in 2 d for that part of the aquifer where the water table fluctuates dewandel et al 2012 and in 3 d to the entire aquifer thickness while introducing the geometrical structure of the weathering profile dewandel et al 2017c mizan et al 2019 those methods combines at a cell scale water table fluctuation and groundwater budget techniques and an aggregation method these methods for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity were tested on several crystalline aquifers exposed to deep weathering in southern india granites 50 1000 km2 and in new caledonia peridotites 3 5 km2 showing very good estimates when compared to existing field data dewandel et al 2012 2017b 2017c the generated hydrodynamic parameters fields although not intended to be perfectly exact can help identifying the spatial pattern of parameters thus providing valuable information on aquifer heterogeneity although hydrodynamic parameters maps provide new insights to identify potential draining zones to site bore wells or to produce groundwater storage maps that find practical applications for establishing water protection zones and improving groundwater management policies the robustness of the evaluated parameters was not confronted with numerical modelling the objective of this paper is to assess the robustness of a hydraulic conductivity map estimated from both a detailed water table map and hydraulic conductivity statistics on a granitic watershed in brittany nançon watershed 57 km2 france fig 1 a the map which is a first order result has been compared to local estimates deduced from hydraulic tests magnetic resonance soundings and streamflow measurements then the map has been tested with hydrodynamic modelling steady state condition allowing to account for its relevance and to test the sensitivity of the approach carried out several models were tested to explore various ways of using the produced hydraulic conductivity map an original point compared to previous studies is the use of spatial streamflow measurements during the low water period to help validating models in addition it is shown on a second watershed maudouve noë sèche 40 km2 fig 1b how with much less field data the methodology can already provide interesting information on the hydraulic conductivity field the main results for this watershed are presented in the discussion the main information concerning this second watershed is provided as supporting information 2 field data 2 1 location climate and general settings the nançon catchment 57 km2 lies 50 km northeast of rennes city in the brittany region france ille et vilaine department fig 1a the area has a gently rolling relief with elevation ranging between 110 and 230 m a s l meters above sea level fig 1a the region experiences an oceanic climate with mean annual rainfall of 940 mm from which most of them are received from september to april low water period occurs from june to october during this period recharge from rainfall to the aquifers is very low to nil particularly in july and august dewandel et al 2020 this is a rural area where a forest occupies a large part of the south of the watershed fougères forest the exploitation of groundwater is moderate and most of the boreholes are used for agricultural needs livestock farming fig 1a however a few structures exploit groundwater for drinking water supply in particular drains in the forest of fougères these trenches 3 to 5 m deep capture some springs and sub surface flows within the saprolites layer highly weathered superficial material and therefore not the aquifer in the strict sense i e the fractured aquifer they form a dendritic network of about 12 km with poorly known geometry and abstraction e g length and abstraction of each branch the first trenches of which were built in the 17th century the total groundwater abstraction is about 1 46 mm3 year of which 1 31 mm3 year are due to the trenches 2 2 geology the geology of the area is relatively homogeneous and consists of granitic rocks biotite granodiorite to the north and biotite cordierite granodiorite to the south two granodiorites with slightly different mineralogical contents mougin et al 2008 fig 1a to the south of the basin there is but in a very poorly represented way the hornfels schists of fougères which are metamorphosed brioverian schists in the center there is a small tertiary age basin made up of landéan clays sedimentary rocks this will not be the object of spatialization of hydrodynamic properties or of particular modelling crystalline rocks are affected by deep in situ weathering that forms of a saprolites layer and an underlying fractured layer layers fig 2 a b mougin et al 2008 were mapped according to geological log database 64 logs of wells intersecting the bottom of the saprolites brgm french geological survey database and numerous field observations 585 saprolites are very widespread in the watershed and composed of ochre brown clay sands whose facies varies relatively little at the watershed scale their thickness is on average 4 m with locally in plateau area thicknesses exceeding twenty meters fig 2a the underlying fractured layer is on average 35 40 m thick and exceeds 60 m thick in some areas in the valleys it may directly outcrop due to erosion of the overlying saprolites on average at the watershed scale the total weathering profile saprolites fractured zone is around 40 m thick fig 2b a few nnw sse faults compartmentalize the profile giving to the weathering profile a piano key structure shifts induced by faults are nevertheless modest ranging from a few meters to around ten meters 2 3 available hydrogeological data 2 3 1 water table map a water table map fig 3 a was drawn based on groundwater level measurements from 99 wells in august 2017 during the dry season snapshot map therefore in absence of significant rainfall and in absence of recharge from rainfall measurements were carried out on unexploited wells most of the time old wells about ten meters deep reaching the top of the fractured layer these wells are screened both in the saprolites where present and the fractured layer in the area annual water level fluctuations at the watershed scale is about 1 m dewandel et al 2020 in august 2017 water levels were shallow at 1 4 m below ground level on average and are more or less parallel to the topographic surface they are not significantly impacted by pumping wells overall water table lies in the top of the fractured layer on valleys and mainly within the saprolites layer on plateaus in order to provide a relevant mapping variogram based statistics and kriging techniques were used e g razack and lasm 2006 fig 3a c as the aquifer is unconfined absence of an impermeable layer at the aquifer top water table depth were interpolated rather than water table levels moreover as the aquifer is connected to streams eg fig 4 c shows a constant increase of streamflow at the watershed scale because aquifers feed the stream kriging was constrained by streams forcing the groundwater levels to pass through them note that this constraint does not impose a flow direction between the aquifer and the stream for example upstream the aquifer may feed the streams while downstream the streams may recharge the aquifers as mapping was done on water level depth a zero value was imposed on the course of streams then the water table map was obtained by simple difference to dem over a 500x500 m cell grid fig 1a fig 3a this method explains the irregular nature of contour lines but constrains the interpolation to the topography thus avoiding where there is no information the water table of an unconfined aquifer to be above a thalweg or other types of depression the map is representative of the water level condition in the weathering profile saprolites and fractured layers and as established under low water condition no recharge from rainfall it is considered a good approximation of aquifer steady state condition the map was used for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity and in numerical modelling 2 3 2 hydraulic conductivity data few pumping test data is available in the area n 5 fig 3b and provides local estimates of the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured layer these hydrogeological data come from the french geological survey database brgm where the basic information concerning hydraulic tests carried out by design and technical offices is stored for the five cases available tests were interpreted with the theis model based on this data hydraulic conductivity ranges between 5x10 7 and 8x10 6 m s 6 3 logk 5 1 mean 5 26 these data fall in the range of the log normal distribution of hydraulic conductivity data deduced from pumping tests of granitoïds at the scale of the brittany region fractured layer fig 3d mean logk 5 4 standard deviation 0 8 brgm database mougin et al 2016 suggesting that this distribution is probably not so far from that of the studied aquifer this distribution was used as training data for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity from the gradient of the residual water table elevation data dewandel et al 2017b section 3 1 although this distribution characterizes the average hydraulic conductivity of the fractured layer the hydraulic conductivities of the less permeable saprolites layer are also in this range mainly in its left part since they are generally in granitic areas between 10 7 and 10 5 m s dewandel et al 2006 this is why this dataset is used to regionalize the hydraulic conductivity from the water table level of the whole weathering profile saprolites and fractured layers however the numerical modelling carried out subsequently will make it possible to evaluate the bias introduced by the use of this distribution local data n 5 were also compared to local estimates of the produced hydraulic conductivity map sixteen magnetic resonance soundings mrs were carried out to improve local data on hydrogeological properties mougin et al 2008 dewandel et al 2020 fig 3b mrs measurements were carried out from the ground surface with the numis poly equipment from iris instruments bernard 2007 with mainly 8 shape square loops for reducing noise level trushkin et al 1994 thirty eight to fifty meter loop size and adapted number of stack ensure liable mrs signal to a maximum investigation depth of about 50 m with signal to noise ratio of 1 4 to 3 5 inversion of mrs measurements were carried out with samovar 11x64 software legtchenko 2013 using a multi layered earth model without geological constraints and automatic regularization process inversion results give estimates of the mrs groundwater content and mrs hydraulic conductivity as a function of depth from which the aquifer porosity and hydraulic conductivity can be deduced wyns et al 2004 vouillamoz et al 2014 fig 4a gives an example of the hydrogeological parameters deduced from mrs in crystalline aquifers vouillamoz et al 2014 showed that mrs porosity needs to be corrected by a factor of about 0 5 to be equivalent that deduced from pumping tests however they showed that the transmissivity and the hydraulic conductivity obtained by the mrs method was very close to that deduced from pumping tests no correction has therefore been made to these data from the sixteen mrs measurements logk values for the fractured layer vary from 5 7 to 3 7 with an average of 4 8 standard deviation 0 6 fig 4b in the range of the previous distribution of hydraulic conductivity these local estimates were also compared to local estimates of the hydraulic conductivity map produced 2 3 3 streamflow measurements at the same time as water level measurements in august 2017 twenty two stream flowrate measurements were performed fig 3b the measurements being carried out under the same low water conditions no recharge by rainfall they correspond to the discharge of groundwater into streams they were performed with an ott flowmeter propeller diameter 50 mm flowrates range from 0 001 m3 s for small catchment area less than1 km2 to 0 13 m3 s at the outlet of the watershed 57 km2 in area plotted according to watershed area fig 4c flowrate increases approximately linearly showing that the aquifer continuously feeds the streams as for water level measurements flowrate values because of low water conditions are assumed to represent a good approximate of aquifer steady state conditions combined with water table map and catchment characteristics i e length of stream area flow values are used for estimating basin scale hydraulic conductivity of each sub catchment dewandel et al 2004 see appendix a values range in logk between 5 7 and 4 9 with an average of 5 3 standard deviation 0 25 fig 4d values are still in the range of the distribution of hydraulic conductivity deduced from pumping tests at the scale of the brittany region fig 3d these basin scale hydraulic conductivity values were compared with those estimated by the regionalization method and flowrates were compared with those computed by numerical modelling 3 methods following dewandel et al 2017b methodology a regionalized hydraulic conductivity map was produced from which values have been compared to local estimates deduced from hydraulic tests mrs measurements and streamflow measurements then the map a first order estimate of the hydraulic conductivity field has been assessed with several hydrodynamic models steady state condition to account for various ways of using the produced map of which spatial streamflow measurements are used for validating models 3 1 method for regionalizing hydraulic conductivity the used method has been recently proposed for evaluating the transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity fields in a crystalline aquifer dewandel et al 2017b and is briefly reminded here it is based on the concept that large scale variations in hydraulic head may give information on large scale hydrodynamic properties where the aquifer is naturally drained no groundwater abstraction where vertical flow can be neglected and where the water table is in pseudo steady state and mainly controlled by topography rather than recharge haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 it can be assumed that the gradient of the water table depends on both topographic slope and aquifer horizontal transmissivity for example in case of relatively flat topography and where groundwater flow is horizontal the use of continuity equation along the same flow line for unit aquifer width darcy s law q t1gradh1 t2gradh2 ti transmissivity and gradhi hydraulic head gradient of compartment i will give high transmissivity values where the hydraulic gradient is low and low values where the gradient is high therefore where the topographic level is almost stable the hydraulic gradient variations are in first approximation inversely related to variations in aquifer transmissivity on the other hand in the case where the topographic variations are not negligible it is necessary before obtaining information on the transmissivity to remove the influence of the topography on the water table elevation by subtracting to it for example a linear water table topography relationship once this trend removed the inverse slope of the residual water table map is computed and then statistically compared to local transmissivity data to produce a transmissivity field the latter can be finally transformed into hydraulic conductivity if information on the thickness of the aquifer is available dewandel et al 2017b then the best possible empirical relationship between the two statistical distributions transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity measured and calculated from the gradient is evaluated while respecting the statistical properties of the transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity measured for the analysis to be meaningful both data sets must describe the widest possible range of transmissivities that can be encountered in the studied aquifer finally the calculated transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity is spatialized and the relevance of the map produced is evaluated on the basis of local estimates of transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity this is relevant because these measurements are not directly included in the mapping method only their statistical distribution one of the assumptions made by the method is that vertical flow is neglected while fractured rocks as here can be affected by sub vertical fractures that allow vertical flow components however in such a granitic weathering profile the hydraulic conductivity of the fractured layer due to a denser horizontal network is about 10 times higher horizontally than vertically maréchal et al 2004 lachassagne et al 2021 which thus promotes horizontal flows in addition as the method uses a basin to sub basin scale approach and that the aquifer thickness is small a few ten meters compared to the sub basin scale km scale then at this scale horizontal flows dominate e g guihéneuf et al 2014 kolbe et al 2016 ayraud et al 2008 which is another argument to use the method here however when the vertical component of the flow exists and is not negligible this can occur locally along the fault for example the method may return falsely lower transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity values but the method still delineates the shape of these areas dewandel et al 2017b the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map of nançon watershed is based on i the inverse gradient of the established water table map fig 3a that was reduced from topographic effect i e inverse gradient of the reduced water table map divided by the aquifer thickness to make data consistent with hydraulic conductivity and ii the regional based statistical relationship for hydraulic conductivity fig 3d the use of this latest relationship instead of a local one because of too little data from hydraulic tests will be discussed later the map was established over a grid of 500x500 m cells and integrates hydraulic conductivity values theoretically horizontal k of the whole weathering profile saprolites and fractured layers however since the fractured layer is the most permeable layer in the weathering profile the map better reflects the hydraulic conductivity of this layer then the map was compared to local hydraulic conductivity estimates pumping tests fig 3b mrs measurements fig 4b and streamflow measurements fig 4d 3 2 numerical modelling assessment of the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map of nançon granitic aquifer was performed by numerical modelling nançon hydrological model was developed using the marthe 7 4 brgm computer code thiéry 2010 2015 thiéry et al 2018 marthe allows 2d or 3d modelling of flows and mass transfers in aquifer systems including climatic and human influences groundwater flow is computed by a 3 d finite volume approach to solve the hydrodynamic equation based on the darcy s law and mass conservation the model comprises a single aquifer layer that merges both saprolites and fractured layers to be consistent with the hydraulic conductivity field obtained from the regionalization method aquifer geometry was established from the dem model fig 1a and the total weathering thickness map fig 2b the small tertiary age basin located in the centre of the watershed landéan clays was not considered in the modelling the modelled domain is discretized into cells of 500x500 metres to be consistent with other data sources a no flow boundary condition is applied to the watershed limits in agreement with the established water table map fig 3a on the other hand groundwater overflow is allowed where the water table surface crosscuts topographic level for the purpose of this study the model does not explicitly take into account the flow in the streams avoiding thus imposed stream boundary conditions that would force the model to evacuate flow through the streams however the model makes possible to compute the groundwater overflow at cell scale i e the groundwater discharge to streams which were compared to streamflow measurements fig 3b 4c in this way streamflow measurements were also used to assess model results geological faults fig 1a and 2 were not considered in the model as they do not influence the water table map fig 3a a homogeneous recharge at the basin scale was applied to the model 96 mm year that corresponds to the streamflow rate measured at the outlet of the watershed in august 2017 during the low flow condition 127 l s fig 4c and the groundwater abstraction at the watershed scale 46 2 l s in terms of groundwater abstraction the model includes those of exploited wells total 18 6 m3 h or 5 2 l s but not the drains in the fougères forest which capture some springs and sub surface flows total 41 l s these drains represent a loss for streamflow computations were performed in steady state condition output of the models were the water balance at the watershed scale the water table map and the groundwater discharges to streams four hydraulic conductivity field models were assessed model 1 used directly the hydraulic conductivity field obtained by the regionalization method section 3 1 model 2 assumed a uniform hydraulic conductivity value mean value of the previous map to go further in the analysis investigations were performed to evaluate if zones of constant hydraulic conductivity emerged from the spatial distribution of the obtained field the geomorphology and or the geology for that purpose an automatic calibration of the hydraulic conductivity field based on head gradient method thiéry 1993 has been achieved from the water table map model 3 this inverted hydraulic conductivity field has been compared to the one deduced from the regionalization method then the inverted field was used to identify two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity whose values are obtained by automatic optimization thiéry 1994 model 4 the results of the four models were analysed based on three criteria i the ability of the model to reproduce the groundwater flow direction at the catchment scale ii the difference between the modelled water table and that observed i e fig 3a and iii the difference between the modelled overflow and the streamflow measurements at the scale of sub catchments i e fig 4c 4 results 4 1 regionalized hydraulic conductivity map figs 5 and 6 show the results of the regionalisation method fig 5a displays the relationship between the elevation and the water table level from which the reduced water table map and its gradient are produced fig 5b shows the statistical distribution of the inverse gradient of the reduced water table divided by the aquifer thickness 1 slope aqui thick in log scale and fig 5c the corresponding map in log scale fig 5d presents the variogram of the map according to the method proposed the best statistical relationship between the two log normal distributions logk from the granitoïds of brittany fig 3d and log 1 slope aqui thick fig 5b is k comp 2 72x10 7x 1 slope aqui thick 2 9x10 6 where k comp is the hydraulic conductivity computed the correlation coefficient between both distributions is r2 0 96 fig 6b although empirical this relationship partly satisfies darcy s law because it assumes a linear relationship between hydraulic conductivity and gradient the constant 2 9x10 6 low compared to the other parameters reflects that some extreme values could not be taken into account mainly extremely low gradient values possibly due to some errors in water table level interpolation these extreme values correspond to approximately 10 of the data this constant may also show the limit of the method for evaluating hydraulic conductivity values on singular high permeable areas and where vertical groundwater flow dominates nonetheless the geometry of these areas can still be assessed fig 6a shows the hydraulic conductivity map deduced from the regionalisation approach established on a 500x500 m cell grid the variographic analysis of logk computed shows that data is moderately structured in space nugget effect greater than 50 of the total variance fig 6c the sill is about 3000 m showing that sectors of similar hydraulic conductivity cover areas of few km2 hydraulic conductivity ranges on four orders of magnitude 10 7 to 10 4 m s with an average value at the watershed scale of about 4x10 6 m s while this map does not claim to be accurate a first order result it allows identifying areas more permeable than others overall values are high in valleys where the water table lies in the fractured layer and low where the water table is in the saprolites layer mainly plateaus fig 2a however for sectors where there are no water level measurements e g forest of fougères near na11a and nan04 mrs points on fig 6a the values have to be considered with caution the resulting map has been compared to local estimates of hydraulic conductivities deduced from pumping tests 5 values see appendix fig b it shows a mean absolute error of 8 0 i e an estimate of the map at 0 43 in logk absolute error abs logk comp logk pump test logk pump test compared to the hydraulic conductivities estimated from mrs measurements 16 values for the fractured layer see appendix fig b the mean relative deviation is 12 5 i e 0 64 in logk in this case calculating the relative deviation to the mean was preferred relative deviation 2xabs logk comp logk mrs logk comp logk mrs as the hydraulic conductivities deduced from mrs measurements are indirect estimates and not direct estimates as from hydraulic tests finally hydraulic conductivity values estimated at sub catchment scale from streamflow measurements were compared to the average map values of the corresponding areas n 22 see appendix fig b the mean relative deviation is 7 6 which corresponds to 0 43 in logk all these comparisons show that the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map provides reliable estimates now the objective is to test its relevance and its sensitivity through numerical modelling 4 2 numerical modelling figs 7 and 8 present the results of the four models in terms of modelled water table and groundwater flow direction location and values of overflows and scattered diagrams table 1 synthesizes the statistical criteria on water table levels at watershed scale and fig 9 compares the model overflows and streamflow measurements at the sub catchment scale 4 2 1 model with the regionalized hydraulic conductivity field model 1 this model used directly the hydraulic conductivity field obtained by the regionalization method fig 6a the model closely reproduces the water table map in terms of order of magnitude fig 7a groundwater flow directions obtained by the model are consistent with those of the water table map fig 7a except for a few sectors i e fougères forest where the model does not show a drainage of the water table by streams however in these sectors as well as at the outlet of the watershed the water table map is not reliable due to the lack of water table measurements like the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map consequently modelled water levels are largely underestimated with differences exceeding 20 m and locally 30 m at the outlet of the watershed fig 7b this result means that the regionalization method tends to overestimate the hydraulic conductivity in those areas elsewhere the differences are smaller and vary between 14 m and 6 5 m with an average bias of 2 m bias difference between modelled and observed water table this underestimation is confirmed by the scatter diagram presented in fig 8a and by the statistical criteria values table 1 the root mean squared error rmse at the watershed scale is 7 1 m nonetheless if data from the sectors of the fougères forest and at the outlet i e 32 cells out of 243 are removed from this analysis the rmse obtained is 3 7 m which is without any optimisation on model parameters a good result apart from the upstream zone of the fougères forest where the model cannot compute overflow because of too low modelled water levels the groundwater overflowing map fig 7c shows a behaviour in accordance with the aquifer functioning the overflow occurs mainly along streams computed groundwater discharges to streams of the sub catchments are compared to available streamflow measurements fig 9 overall flows are comparable for the upstream catchments located to the north the east and the south west e g bv1 bv2 bv5 bv8 bv13 and bv15 on the other hand for the sub catchments bv4 and bv16 the computed groundwater discharges to streams overestimates measured values of about 30 l s with repercussions for bv4 on downstream points along the stream bv7 bv9 bv18 these differences can be explained by unknown exploited wells in these areas but most probably because of its order of magnitude from part of the groundwater flow collected by the drains located in the forest of fougères drains being not considered in the model that cannot reach the streams total abstraction of drains 41 l s some upstream parts of these sub catchments taking place in this forest therefore the flow measurements in these areas are most likely reduced from the abstraction of drains 4 2 2 model with a uniform hydraulic conductivity value model 2 in order to assess the benefit of the hydraulic conductivity field proposed by the regionalization method this second model uses a uniform hydraulic conductivity value at the watershed scale which is the average value of regionalized field 3 9x10 6 m s fig 7e shows that the water level deviation is 3 m on the valleys but the water table is largely underestimated on the plateaus and some dry valleys 15 20 m the trends are similar to model 1 however according to the statistical criteria established for the two models table 1 the results obtained using the regionalized hydraulic conductivity field are better in terms of bias rmse etc results on overflows are similar to the one of the model 1 fig 9 4 2 3 model with two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity values models 3 and 4 4 2 3 1 inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field model 3 using marthe s code thiéry 1993 an automatic inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field was performed from the observed water table map fig 3a by constraining the model with the extreme hydraulic conductivity values obtained by the regionalization method min 6x10 8 m s max 7x10 5 m s the inversion method is based on hydraulic head gradients approach and consists in adjusting in each cell of the model the value of the hydraulic conductivity to reduce the error between the computed head and the measured one as an initial value for the inversion the hydraulic conductivity is assumed uniform over the entire domain and corresponds to the mean value tested in model 2 k 3 9 x10 6 m s fig 10 a and b show the hydraulic conductivity field obtained by inverse modelling and their statistical distribution in logk the distribution of the inverted field is fairly homogeneous with more than 95 of values between 6x10 6 m s and 6x10 7 m s the minimum value is 2x10 7 m s maximum 1 8x10 5 m s and the average 1 4x10 6 m s which is lower than that of the regionalized field 3 9x10 6 m s 65 of the values are in the range 1 2x10 6 3 3x10 6 m s and 30 in the range 3x10 7 8x10 7 m s and are overall higher on the valleys than on the plateaus as previously observed fig 1a the comparison between this map and the one from the regionalization method is discussed later the statistical criteria established for this model are naturally good fig 8c table 1 the bias and the rmse on water table are 0 7 m and 1 7 m respectively the computed groundwater discharges to streams of the water table of sub catchments are compared to local measurements fig 9 values are comparable for many sub basins e g bv1 bv2 bv5 bv8 bv13 and bv15 for bv4 a significant flow difference is still observed 29 l s which also affects downstream points bv7 bv9 bv18 the possible explanations of these differences are those given above 4 2 3 2 model with two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity model 4 based on the distribution of the inverted field fig 10b two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity were defined zone 1 and zone 2 fig 10c zone 1 generally corresponds to the valleys where the fractured layer outcrops and zone 2 coincides with the upstream part of sub catchments and plateaus as well as zones with a significant thickness of saprolites excepted in the fougères forest note that this zoning between the most permeable areas on the valleys and the least permeable on the plateaus was already visible on the hydraulic conductivity map resulting from the regionalization method fig 6a finally an automatic optimization of the hydraulic conductivity values of the two zones was carried out with marthe s code this optimization was constrained by the following hydraulic conductivity values for zone 1 10 6 m s 2x10 5 m s and for zone 2 10 8 m s 9x10 7 m s resulting uniform hydraulic conductivities are 2 1x10 6 m s for zone 1 and 3 3x10 7 m s for zone 2 therefore higher where the water table is located in the fractured layer and lower where it is in the saprolites the scatter diagram fig 8d shows that the model reproduces the observed water table well with very satisfactory statistical criteria table 1 at the watershed scale the bias is 0 67 m and the rsme is 1 8 m thus very close to the model using the inverted hydraulic conductivity field model 3 results on groundwater discharges to streams at sub catchment scale are similar to the previous models fig 9 5 discussion 5 1 regionalized hydraulic conductivity despite the restrictive hypotheses assumed in the regionalization method vertical flow neglected absence of pumping wells water table in pseudo steady state and controlled by topography the resulting regionalized hydraulic conductivity field on the nançon watershed shows consistent results compared to other available data sources pumping tests estimates from mrs measurements and from streamflows at sub catchment scale it also appears that the hypothesis which neglects the vertical flow did not introduce a significant bias at the watershed scale this is mainly due to the thinness of the aquifer compared to the groundwater flow lines at the watershed scale which limits vertical flow components at this scale guihéneuf et al 2014 kolbe et al 2016 ayraud et al 2008 the comparisons with local hydraulic conductivity estimates show also that despite the lack of local available hydraulic data for evaluating a clear distribution of hydraulic conductivity at the watershed scale the use of the training distribution from the granitoïds of brittany provides a satisfactory result although defined for the fractured layer only in addition the map also shows good consistency with the mrs estimates which confirms previous works vouillamoz et al 2014 hydraulic conductivity ranges on four orders of magnitude 10 7 to 10 4 m s average 3 9x10 6 m s which is consistent to other works performed on granitic aquifers e g maréchal et al 2004 dewandel et al 2012 furthermore it confirms that where granitic rocks are exposed to deep weathering processes aquifers are characterized by similar ranges of hydrogeological properties dewandel et al 2006 lachassagne et al 2011 2021 which facilitates and justifies the use of training data in the absence of sufficient local data as it was done here although the method does not claim to be perfectly accurate the produced map a first order result describes the spatial heterogeneity and shows that sectors of similar hydraulic conductivity cover areas of the order of few km2 as indicated previously a certain consistency is found with the geological information as on the whole the values are the highest where the water table lies in the fractured layer mainly valleys and the lowest in areas where the water table is the saprolites layer mainly plateaus fig 11 compares the field obtained from the inverse modelling model 3 to that proposed by the regionalization method the average relative deviation is 2 5 with a mean deviation less than or equal to 5 over 93 of the whole area which corresponds to logk 0 29 this shows that the regionalization method made it possible to propose a spatial pattern of the hydraulic conductivity field relatively close to that obtained by the inverse modelling in addition fig 11a illustrates that as soon as the density of water table measurements is sufficient the method provides relatively robust estimates deviation of less than 3 5 over 75 of the basin i e logk 0 20 however where the density of field data decreases e g fougères forest outlet of the watershed the estimates of the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map but also the map resulting from the inverse modelling logically become more erroneous this point on data density is addressed below through an experiment performed on the maudouve noë sèche watershed 5 2 modelling the suitability of the four sets of hydraulic conductivity field was assessed the regionalized field model 1 an uniform field model 2 average value of the previous model the one deduced from inverse modelling model 3 and the last with two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity model 4 defined from the previous one overall and depending on the models the observed water table is more or less well reproduced with uncertainties in the fougères forest and at the outlet of the basin due to the lack of field data the simulated groundwater discharges to streams are comparable to measurements made in many sub catchments however the models generally overestimate the stream flows in some places this can be explained one the one hand by a lack of knowledge about the pumping wells influence possibly underestimated but most likely on the second hand by the drains in the fougères forest not considered in models capturing part of the groundwater that can no longer return to streams total abstraction from drains 41 l s the model using the regionalized field directly model 1 reproduces rather well the water table map and the groundwater flow directions except in the fougères forest due to the lack of data considering all the assumptions involved in the regionalization method this is already a good result however modelled water table levels are in average underestimated which can be explained by the use of the training distribution hydraulic conductivity database from granitoids of brittany and not from values of the studied watershed it is therefore possible that the mean of this latter distribution may be greater than that of the nançon watershed what is ultimately suggested by the fields resulting from the numerical inversion and optimization of models 3 and 4 k average model 1 3 9x10 6 m s model 3 1 4x10 6 m s model 4 1 3x10 6 m s this difference can also be explained by the use of a training distribution defined for the fractured layer while the regionalized map is deduced from information on the entire weathering profile thus integrating the less permeable saprolites layer the model using an average value of hydraulic conductivity at the watershed scale model 2 shows similar trends to the model 1 underestimation of the water table although its statistical criteria are less good note that this model is derived from the regionalized model and if the average hydraulic conductivity of the pumping tests had been used the water table would have been even more underestimated average of 5 data 5 5x10 6 m s the relative success of this model is probably explained by the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity that is characterized by set of small areas few km2 with homogeneous values this leads to a relatively randomized and homogeneous pattern of the hydraulic conductivity field at the watershed scale which explains the constant increase of flow groundwater flow along streams fig 4c this underlines the relatively homogenous character of such aquifers at the scale of watersheds of a few ten km2 allowing approximating them by a porous medium and thus prescribing uniform hydraulic conductivity values to each layers or compartments to provide reliable estimates of the water table and flow distribution join et al 2005 rivard et al 2008 leray et al 2013 kolbe et al 2016 2017 durand et al 2017 mclaren et al 2012 dickson et al 2018 for models 3 and 4 the regionalized field was used to constrain the inverted hydraulic conductivity fields the model with two zones of uniform hydraulic conductivity model 4 was based on the distribution of hydraulic conductivity deduced from the inverse modelling of the water table map model 3 nonetheless these areas or at least areas of similar shapes could have been defined directly from the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map more permeable in valleys and mainly the low permeable on plateaus the use of this two zone field the hydraulic conductivity of which is obtained by an automatic optimization method has led to very satisfactory results rmse 1 8 m very close to that of the inverted field at the watershed scale model 3 this result is explained as for the results of model 2 by the relative homogeneity of the aquifer layers properties at the km scale model 3 confirms that as expected the mean hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is higher where the water table is located in the fractured zone valleys and lower where it is located in the saprolites plateaus this result is very encouraging and opens prospects for using qualitative information to constrain the spatialization of hydrodynamic parameters therefore the combined use of the regionalization method for defining zones and hydraulic conductivity ranges and the numerical inversion made it possible to reduce the uncertainties of the hydraulic conductivity field 5 3 application on areas with much less field data in order to test the sensitivity of our approach on areas with a lesser amount of data similar experiments were carried out on the maudouve noë sèche watershed brittany region côte d armor dept france fig 1b similarly to the nançon area a regionalized hydraulic conductivity map was produced and assessed through numerical modelling here only the regionalized field similar to the model 1 in nançon has been evaluated with the objective of assessing whether with less data on the water table it is possible to produce realistic results only the main results are presented here more information is provided as supporting information the area corresponds to two contiguous catchments the maudouve 30 km2 and the noë sèche 10 km2 the geological context of the area is more contrasted compared to that of the nançon basin and consists of granitoïds of various types mainly granites and migmatites rocks are also deeply weathered but the saprolites layer has been largely eroded thickness a few metres to ten metres and the underlying fractured layer is on average 40 m thick a water table map was drawn for august 2018 using the same technic as described above but using measurements on 33 abandoned wells only fig 12 a water levels are shallow at 0 7 m below ground level on average more or less parallel to the topographic surface based on this map and the hydraulic conductivity distribution of granitoïds of brittany fig 3d a regionalized hydraulic conductivity map was built fig 12b map values cover four orders of magnitude 10 7 to 10 4 m s with an average value at the watershed scale of 2 8x10 6 m s close to the one evaluated for the nançon area its comparison to the few available local estimates shows relatively consistent results from pumping tests mean absolute error 16 9 logk 0 83 n 3 but all located in the same area from mrs measurements mean relative deviation 4 5 logk 0 25 n 7 available within the watershed and from streamflow measurements mean relative deviation 6 1 logk 0 33 n 8 similarly to the nançon area the numerical model considers the topography the geometry of the weathering profile and the abstraction of exploited wells total 8 5 m3 h or 2 4 l s model boundary conditions are no flow boundary at the watershed limits and homogeneous recharge at the scale of each watershed noë sèche 160 mm and maudouve 120 mm with respect to the streamflow rates measured at the outlets of watersheds and groundwater abstraction computations were performed on a 500x500 m cell grid and model results were analysed based on the same criteria as before fig 12 c and d presents the results of this modelling the modelled water table map reproduces fairly well the observed map fig 12 d bias 2 9 m rmse 6 5 m and computed groundwater discharges to streams are consistent with streamflow measurements fig 12 c excepted at the outlet of the maudouve watershed where the record at the gauging station is possibly underestimated no field discharge measurement was performed there these results confirm that the use of the regionalized hydraulic conductivity map gives satisfactory results despite a density of water table data 0 8 pts km2 two times lower compared to nançon watershed 1 74 pts km2 however as for the nançon area the regionalization method tends to overestimate the hydraulic conductivity values modelled water table lower than measured fig 12d probably because of the hydraulic conductivity distribution used brittany fig 3d defined for the fractured layer while the regionalized map is deduced from information on the entire weathering profile finally the presented results show that with a density of water table measurements of about 1 measurement per km2 and few streamflow measurements during low water conditions it is possible to obtain a relatively robust first order assessment of the hydraulic conductivity field 6 conclusion modelling of groundwater resources in crystalline aquifers is often difficult mainly because of the strong spatial heterogeneity of aquifer parameters the evaluation of the regionalized hydraulic conductivity maps with numerical models in steady state condition made it possible to report their relevance and to test the sensitivity of the approach carried out on two granitic watersheds in brittany nançon watershed 57 km2 and maudouve noë sèche 40 km2 on nançon watershed the model using directly the regionalized field model 1 reproduces rather well the water table map and the groundwater flow directions except in the fougères forest due to the lack of data rmse on the water table levels is 7 1 m over the entire domain but decreases to 3 7 m when sectors where no water level measurements are excluded however simulated water table levels are in average underestimated this can be explained by the use of a training distribution hydraulic conductivity database from granitoids of brittany and not one established from values obtained on the studied watershed but also because this distribution is defined for the fractured layer while the regionalized map is deduced from the information on the entire weathering profile both saprolites and fractured layers consequently the regionalized field moderately overestimates the average aquifer hydraulic conductivity 3 9x10 6 instead of 1 4x10 6 m s the comparison between the field obtained from the inverse modelling model 3 and that proposed by the regionalization method model 1 shows that both fields are close in terms of mean values and spatial distribution mean deviation between the two fields is 2 5 logk 0 14 this highlights that as soon as sufficient information is available on the water table it is possible to propose a relatively robust hydraulic conductivity map at the watershed scale the model 2 uniform field shows similar trends but statistical criteria are significantly less good particularly on plateau areas finally the model 4 a 2 zone hydraulic conductivity field has led to satisfactory results rmse 1 8 m which underlines as model 2 the relatively homogenous character of such aquifers at a km scale this model model 3 shows that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is higher 2 1x10 6 m s where the water table is located in the fractured zone valleys and lower 3 3x10 7 m s where it is located in the saprolites plateaus what is ultimately expected in all models the computed groundwater discharges to streams of the water table are comparable to the streamflows measured in most sub catchments however the models overestimate them in certain places which can be due to the lack of knowledge on pumping wells but mainly to the drains in the forest of fougères that capture part of the groundwater flow which can no longer return to the streams for the maudouve noë sèche watershed the modelled water table map based on the regionalized field reproduce fairly well the observed map bias 2 9 m rmse 6 5 m and computed groundwater overflows are overall consistent with streamflow measurements the regionalization method makes it possible to produce a first order assessment of the hydraulic conductivity field which shows a good consistency with local hydraulic conductivity estimates is able to describe zones with high and low values and when used in a numerical model reproduces rather well the water table map the groundwater flow directions and groundwater discharges to streams even if one can doubt the reality of the estimated value at a given point the regionalized field can be taken as an advantage for carrying out a relatively robust modelling with the creation of zones of different hydraulic conductivity from ranges of values given by the map e g model 4 on nançon watershed the other advantage of the regionalization method is that unlike the inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field by mathematical models it is not necessary to prescribe a recharge or other boundary conditions conditions often difficult to estimate or even geometry of aquifers in this case only a regionalization of aquifer transmissivity is possible thus many conditions that can influence the hydraulic conductivity field obtained from the inversion the joint use of the regionalization method and the numerical inversion therefore makes it possible to reduce the uncertainties of models to go further it would be interesting to test these approaches on other watersheds and in particular larger watersheds of the order of 1000 km2 or more then arises the question to define the density of the measurements required in terms for example of water table measurements or number of hydraulic tests to reasonably use the method for the maudouve noë sèche watershed the density of water table measurements for establishing the regionalized field was around half 0 8 pt km2 the one of nançon area 1 74 pt km2 the results are naturally less precise but already give an idea of the distribution of hydraulic conductivities at the watershed scale this is an essential point on which future works must focus another point will concern areas with a highly contrasted hydraulic conductivity field or within complex aquifer systems i e with zones characterized by very contrasted properties and even in depth the regionalization method should be repeated for each area or depth interval provided that the hydraulic conductivity distributions of each zone here one layer model has been used for reproducing the water table map efforts should be made in the future to generate 3 d hydraulic conductivity field which will allow to integrate the 3 d structures of these aquifers i e saprolites and fractured layers and thus improve of our models
