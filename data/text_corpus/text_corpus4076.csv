20380,in tramp shipping a preliminary route is required for voyage planning at the pre fixture stage before a chartering contract is agreed such routes are conventionally designated by using pilot charts or software considering long term statistical weather however it has been experienced by tramp operators that such route solutions often poorly estimated sailing distances for long journeys and thereby cause inappropriate cost estimation and bad voyage plan to fill this gap a data driven methodology is proposed in this paper to establish a practical route library with the consideration of ship sizes load conditions and seasonality in this method it first requires a dividing of ship trajectories into local sea passage and open sea passage the voyage trajectories made of ais points are then simplified to pattern nodes based on a speed weighted geolocation method afterwards the kmeans algorithm is deployed to properly classify these pattern nodes identifying the most representative nodes routes in open sea passages simultaneously the connection points are identified by dbscan algorithm representing local sea passages combining the representative routes in open sea passages and the connection points in local sea passages the most navigated routes between two ports are obtained finally case studies are conducted for the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean respectively using global ais data from tanker vessels to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this methodology the proposed route library is capable of providing reliable route references to support the decision making at the pre fixture stage keywords route library ais data voyage planning machine learning 1 introduction nowadays shipping is the most carbon efficient form of transportation delivering 80 of all goods gloabally metcalfe et al 2018 in tramp shipping when a cargo is to be transported the shipping company must estimate the voyage cost based on a preliminary route and bid for a contract a misguided route may substantially impair their competitiveness as a consequence conventionally reference routes are designated by using pilot charts or software considering long term statistical weather brooks and faust 2018 in this way uncertainties will always be introduced due to human factors such as the insufficient experience of staff in the chartering department especially for route planning crossing oceans with unknown regions as a consequence a poor estimation of sailing distances may be produced for long journeys and thereby cause problems such as extra sailing time and fuel consumptions when executing further operation according to tramp operators therefore an alternative method is required to facilitate the preliminary route planning at the pre fixture for shipping industry the historical voyage trajectories have great potential for improving shipping transportation but due to lack of data they have not been fully utilized thanks to the automatic identification system ais the voyage data have been constantly accumulated the ais is originally developed as a maritime safety and traffic surveillance system ball 2012 loretta 2016 svanberg et al 2019 according to the international association of maritime aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities iala the original purpose of the system was to improve the maritime safety and efficiency of navigation safety of life at sea and the protection of the maritime environment iala 2003 requirements and plans for implementation of ais system are outlined in the international convention for the safety of life at sea solas imo 2012 the regulation requires the ais system to be fitted aboard all ships of 300 gross tonnage and upwards engaged on international voyages cargo ships of 500 gross tonnage and upwards not engaged on international voyages and all passenger ships irrespective of size thus a massive quantity of ais data are accumulated which are able to facilitate not only practical vessel operations but also research activities in the maritime domain kotovirta et al 2009 le tixerant et al 2018 each ais ping consists of features to describe the current status which is normally categorized as static information semi static information and dynamic information ou and zhu 2008 static information i e ship name ship size build year and others includes information programmed in advance into the ais system when commissioning the vessels while dynamic information e g longitude latitude speed course time stamp and others is the real time information based on sensors the semi static information is the voyage related data such as the sailing distance loading condition destination and others which may be manually added and modified the utilizing of ais data on maritime research has largely proved itself in past decades le tixerant et al 2018 svanberg et al 2019 the majority of research has focused on maritime traffic analysis in narrow and congested waterways since the ais from the beginning was based on vhf very high frequency signals not satellites schelmedine shelmerdine 2015 conducted an initial analysis of ais data within one year in shetland region zhang et al 2018 extracted turning nodes and then built navigation routes network using these turning points in the qiongzhou strait based on ais data chen et al 2015 extracted a principal fairway in taiwan strait altan and otay 2017 studied the maritime traffic of ships at the strait of istanbul based on data over one year different data features were statistically analysed including the number of ship distribution ship types speeds and courses several researchers have investigated trajectory similarities based on ais data using different techniques gonzalez et al 2007 chen et al 2011 such as machine learning granlund and knutsson 2013 jelinek 1997 bishop 2006 lecun et al 2015 agamennoni et al 2010 shalev shwartz and ben david 2014 and dynamic time warping dtw myers et al 1980 to identity similarities ismail and vigneron ismail and vigneron 2015 proposed the merge distance md algorithm for the measuring of similarity between route trajectories li et al 2018 measured the trajectory similarity through md and then re sampled a representative dataset based on the similarity matrix the new representative dataset was clustered by dbscan ester et al 1996 schubert et al 2017 to obtain points for navigated routes han and yang 2020 calculated the route similarities accounting for voyage directions and vessel geographical locations however the investigation of spatial voyage routes in open seas with long legs larger than 3000 nm is rare the voyage route selections related to satellite based ais data are quite new meanwhile the shipping industry has been searching for different ways of selecting a proper navigated route at the pre fixture stage for a better commercial bidding an option is to simply use the shortest route in a region but it may result in a route which is most likely too short and thereby causes too low cost estimation alternatively the most navigated routes representing typical historical voyage patterns should be proposed for practical utilizing according to the needs of shipping companies therefore in this paper a route selection method is developed together with ml techniques based on ais data in order to select the most navigated routes aiming to facilitate the decision making at the pre fixture stage a route library is established based on global ais data of tankers within a five years period the structure of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we construct a methodology for the identification of the most navigated routes using ais data in section 3 we do scoping cleaning preparation and detailed investigation of five years of tanker shipping ais data based on the analysis we in section 4 propose grouping of ships and voyages to improve the model performance in section 5 we present and discuss the final results of two cases and the performance of our models and derive a statistical distribution of the most navigated routes for specific subgroups of tankers and voyages depending on seasonality size and loading condition finally we draw the conclusions and propose suggestions for further research 2 methodology for constructing an ais based route library in order to construct an ais based route library for practical use a data driven methodology is developed in this paper due to the route structures suggested by the proposed method all voyages are firstly divided into two subsets namely the open sea passage and the local sea passage it can be further divided into departure and destination local sea passages details will be elaborated in section 3 2 using real ais datasets to extract the open sea passages a speed weighted geolocation method is proposed simplifying voyage trajectories into pattern nodes the kmeans algorithm is then deployed to classify the pattern nodes so as to find the representative routes in open sea passages simultaneously for the local sea passages the ais data are processed by dbscan algorithm to represent the route pattern with connection points the most navigated routes between ports are identified by combining the open sea representative routes and the local connection points therefore the data driven methodology and its general application steps for the identification of the most navigated routes are first described in section 2 1 under this logic the detailed descriptions of respective techniques adopted in this method are then presented from section 2 2 to section 2 3 the terminology used in this paper is described as follows the pattern nodes denote the extracted nodes which can represent voyage trajectories the connection points are defined as merging points of multiple voyage trajectories which can not only connect all open sea passages in common but also can be used for local distance estimate 2 1 data driven methodology and its application procedures the proposed data driven methodology for route identification consists of a speed weighted geolocation method to form pattern nodes see section 2 2 and two types of ml techniques dbscan and kmeans see section 2 3 fig 1 is the flowchart to illustrate the methodology and its application procedures the deployed techniques are highlighted in red note that in this methodology we simply apply the ml techniques without any improvements of the algorithms themselves since the current patterns are sufficient to identify routes from the standpoint of practice all dataset should be divided into local sea passages and open sea passages before training see fig 6 in section 3 2 for concrete cases detailed description of the flowchart is presented as follows connection points in local sea passages train connection points in local sea passages by dbscan and update the points when needed navigated routes in open sea passages compute pattern nodes based on speed weighted geolocation method then extract navigated routes by kmeans finally find the nodes voyages with the minimum distances close to cluster centroids the most navigated routes combine the navigated route in open sea and its corresponding connection points in local sea between journey departure and destination based on the most navigated routes relevant voyage information such as journey distance can be accurately estimated note that the training of connection points in local sea passages and the identification of navigated routes in open sea passages can be conducted simultaneously 2 2 speed weighted geolocation method since each voyage trajectory consists of a series of ais data points a pattern node should be extracted in order to standardize trajectory representation unlike other existing methods such as dtw and md to directly trace trajectory similarity the proposed method first simplifies the trajectory a two dimensional 2d spatial line into a node one dimensional spatial point accounting for the geographical positions of each ais data point x i j and y i j and vessel speeds v i j the coordinates of pattern nodes z i y and z i x are calculated to represent the i th 2d voyage trajectory as expressed by eq 1 x i j denotes the normalized j th ais position of vessels in terms of latitude in the i th single voyage while y i j denotes the normalized j th ais position of vessels in terms of longitude in the i th voyage the overall number of ais points in the i th voyage is n i note that geographical locations are normalized by their extreme values within the dataset the aim of using speed as a weight is to account for the speed variation during a voyage and also to increase the data size in terms of distribution in the same sea region so as to have a better identification by kmeans as illustrated in fig 2 for example a ship can sail from connection point 1 cp1 to connection point 2 cp2 with four different options indicated by different colours using this method the corresponding pattern nodes of four voyages are a b c and d respectively 1 z i y j 1 n i y i j v i j n z i x j 1 n i x i j v i j n in this way all the pattern nodes of ship trajectories in an open sea area can be computed forming a new dataset representing all possible routes afterwards with the new dataset the kmeans algorithm shalev shwartz and ben david 2014 is adopted to find similar clusters and the node close to the centre of each cluster would be selected as one of the navigated routes euclidean distance is used to find the centre points it should be noted that a limitation exists for the application of this method for instance the number of ais points for routes in the same open sea regions are not often identical with varied speeds theoretically excessively large speeds may separate such pattern nodes into different clusters and thereby cause bad or wrong route selections however in practice it rarely happens since the average sailing speeds are quite similar one remedy is to remove all speed outliers during data cleaning meanwhile we further divide original dataset into several subsets so that such discrepancies may be reduced as described in section 3 2 2 3 unsupervised machine learning algorithms the unsupervised machine learning ml algorithms kmeans and dbscan are deployed together with the speed weighted geolocation method to find the most navigated routes a brief description of these two algorithms are presented in this section 2 3 1 kmeans the kmeans algorithm shalev shwartz and ben david 2014 attempts to minimize the average squared distance of the representative object to all the other objects x in the same clusters as expressed by eq 2 in this objective function the trained dataset is partitioned into sets c 1 c k where μ i is the centroid of the partitioned clusters c i d x μ i 2 is the square distance of each point x in a given set to the centroid of its cluster 2 l k m e a n s m i n j 1 k x c i d x μ i 2 the number of clusters k is the parameter needed in a kmeans algorithm in practice it is often up to the user to choose the parameter k that is the most suitable number for given clustering problems a simple iterative algorithm is normally applied to minimize the kmeans objective cost in the iterative procedure the k value is first given so as to partition the overall dataset initialization is then performed with a randomly chosen centroids μ i μ k for any points in given clusters the distance between points and their centroids are calculated update of the centroid is iteratively performed based on the summation of all the distance until the solution is converged in this paper kmeans algorithm is used to select the representative navigated routes by finding clusters and their centres 2 3 2 dbscan density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm is a density based unsupervised clustering algorithm initially proposed by ester et al 1996 it has been widely implemented and is available in popular toolkits such as scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 a simple density level estimation is used in dbscan based on a threshold for the number of neighbours minpts within a given radius ϵ three basic concepts including core points border points and noise are defined through the points interaction relationship such as direct density reachability density reachability and others as illustrated in fig 3 in this case the parameter m i n p t s is 4 and the radius distance ϵ is indicated by all the circles point n is a noise point because it is not density reachable from any other points point a is a core point while points b and c are border points the black arrows indicate direct density reachability points b and c are only density connected since both of them are density reachable from a based on such concept definitions the basic algorithm of dbscan can be simply described the database is first linearly scanned for objects not been processed the non core points are assigned to noise when a core point is discovered its neighbours are iteratively expanded and added to a cluster when encountered later by the linear scan objects that have been assigned to a cluster will then be skipped border points are normally assigned to the first cluster they are reachable from in the original algorithm thus the result of applying such dbscan algorithm is deterministic but may change a little if the dataset is permuted dbscan is used in this paper to train the connection points in local sea passages in order to evaluate the training accuracy of model clustering by ml techniques the metric of silhouette coefficient rousseeuw 1987 is used which is a measurement of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters the score ranges between 1 and 1 where a high value indicates that the clustering configuration is appropriate from the standpoint of practice the score approaching 0 4 is considered acceptable in this paper 3 ais data scoping modelling and analysis two original ais datasets of tankers are explored in the present analysis it includes one with daily recordings from january 2014 to march 2019 and the other with hourly recordings from december 2018 to september 2020 data details containing ais static information e g ship name and ship size dynamic information e g speed longitude and latitude and semi static information voyage distance and destinations are available for use the datasets are first described cleaned and visualized then dividing strategy of data is elaborated preparing for further route selections by the methodology introduced in section 2 the analyses of influential factors of shipping are conducted in section 3 3 3 1 data scoping cleansing and preparation in order to better explore data the entire datasets are visualized as seen in figs 4 and 5 fig 4 illustrates the density map of all the tanker voyages through daily ais dataset within 5 years in this route library the voyages with long leg larger than 3000 nm are the only focuses thus any voyages less than 3000 nm will be filtered in advance there are main regions with high voyage density such as voyages from us to europe and voyages from asia to gulf more than 500000 voyages from 4600 ships are finally included in the dataset which consists of six million daily positions and their corresponding information the number of terminals ports are 3288 in total which have been roughly classified into 518 main port and 25 main regions meanwhile the high frequency ais dataset with hourly based recordings of a selected tanker fleet is available as seen in the density map in fig 5 this dataset has for all voyages 776 000 hourly positions and is only used to identify connection points of local sea passages for the sake of accuracy no filter of voyages is needed missing data such as the journey distance are also fixed by recalculation based on the voyage geographical locations furthermore wrongly assigned terminal names are observed due to the mistakenly input by crews duplicates terminals have been found in different countries for instance the terminal name of damen ship repair belongs to either the netherlands or france which has introduced ambiguity in the data grouping all these observed data problems are fixed before further utilizing 3 2 data division into local versus open sea passages for every major region the ais data are manually divided into three subsets as described in section 2 namely the departure local sea passage the open sea passage and the destination local sea passage specifically the subset of open sea passages is only used for the selection of the navigated routes the subsets of local seas passages are used to train common connection points note that the data in local sea passages are not the daily ais positions but the hourly high frequency data in order to identify connection points with high accuracy as a result the two datasets should have the same cutting boundary so that the final selected voyages would not overlap the determination of the cutting boundary is flexible based on the observation of data distribution and the shape of local territories since it will not affect too much on the methods application as seen in fig 6 two cases are presented to elaborate the data division strategy including the left one between gulf and east northeast asia and the right one between gulf and west europe the local passages are indicated by the black boxes while the open sea passages are the rest of the voyages it has been observed that the voyages in local passages have regular patterns with common connection points determined by the density of voyages distribution as shown by the red dots combining the selected open sea route with the extracted connection points the most navigated routes in a given region are found examples of them are also highlighted as seen from route a to route d 3 3 analysis of parameters influencing ship routes in this section we investigate the impact of seasonality ship size and loading condition on executed routes of voyages based on ais data in open sea passages the clarifying of their effects on the voyage execution facilitates a better data grouping to identify the most navigated routes 3 3 1 vessel seasonality analysis as stated by shelmerdine 2015 processing ais data on a monthly basis is found to be highly beneficial as it allowed greater flexibility for future outputs and provided a manageable quantity of data for analysis hence the dataset is also analysed monthly to consider the seasonality effect searching for the tendency of route variations fig 7 shows an example of the seasonal distribution of voyages from the gulf region to the east northeast asia region across the pacific ocean the ais data in local sea passages are intentionally removed four temporal periods are aggregated by months including december to february march to april may to august and september to november it is found that crews chose more routes towards the south in winter time in the pacific ocean e g voyages from december to february compared with summer time e g voyages from may to august voyage distribution in the period from march to april presents a pattern similar to the one from december to february routes from september to november gradually moved to the northern part of the ocean presenting heavy density in the middle region close to hawaii islands therefore it can be briefly concluded that the route choice pattern varies with seasonality dataset should be grouped based on such voyage differences in different temporal periods 3 3 2 vessel loading condition analysis the change of loading conditions during vessel operations will affect their seakeeping ability faltinsen 1993 the operational draft of vessels varies during sailing affecting the voyage routes in seas when encountering different sea states however the ais dataset only roughly indicates whether a voyage is in a laden condition or a ballast condition hence the effect of draft variation will not be considered during sailing instead only the two loading conditions are used indicated by 1 for laden condition and 0 for ballast condition in the ais dataset respectively note that the loading condition is a parameter which crews manually put into system during sailing therefore data errors are unavoidable as a consequence fig 8 illustrates the distribution of route patterns between gulf and east northeast asia region in different loading conditions where the orange points denote all voyages in laden condition and the red points denote all voyages in ballast condition it is found that the majority of data are labelled as laden condition for instance 68 of voyages from east northeast asia to gulf and 99 9 of voyages from gulf to east northeast asia therefore no further data grouping is conducted for voyages in ballast condition due to limited number of data 3 3 3 ship size analysis the size of vessels in terms of cargo carrying capacity may affect the route selections in practical journey especially when encountering bad weather in practice there are two basic types of oil tankers hsu et al 2015 crude tankers and product tankers based on the further recommendation of shipping companies in this project seven standard ship types small mr1 mr2 handy lr1 lr2 and aframax are adopted without considering the specific vessel functions whatever crude or product tankers each type corresponds to a specific size range based on their carrying capacities for instance lr1 type is between 60000 dwt and 84999 dwt in the dataset the overall tanker size ranges between 25000 dead weight metric ton dwt and 120000 dwt as seen in the second column of table 1 the raw information of ship types from dataset is listed including 21 different types in total in order to consider ship size in a manageable way so that the identified results can be generalized in practice the original vessel types have been updated into the corresponding standard types note that during this process the vessel types with few number of data are manually changed into other similar type with sufficient number of data e g panamax mt dirty to lr1 standard type for the sake of model accuracy due to the limited data scale in each region we further aggregate the standard vessel categorizes based on data analysis as seen in fig 9 it illustrates the effect of ship size on the variations of voyage selections three types lr2 mr2 and small are visualized for comparison in the atlantic ocean it is observed that the larger vessels e g lr2 are more prone to use stable routes in regions close to the northern ocean compared with the smaller ones e g small some of the routes in small and mr2 types are gradually moving to the southern region presenting larger scatters in distribution compared with the lr2 type this phenomenon demonstrates the weak seakeeping performance and relatively well manoeuvrability of vessels in smaller size trying to following a more suitable routes when encountering adverse factors in seas such as bad weather therefore it is reasonable for us to recategorize the vessel type due to limited data scale only two new categories of ship type are defined for further route selections in this paper namely large type incl aframax lr2 and lr2 roughly between 60000 dwt and 125000 dwt and small type incl small handy mr1 and mr2 roughly between 25000 dwt and 59999 dwt 4 prioritizing voyage groups for further route investigation in this section the voyages in two major oceans the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean are grouped based on the data analysis results in section 3 as a result there are two major grouping systems for voyages in the pacific ocean and voyages in the atlantic ocean respectively the difference is largely due to the different weather patterns observed from data analysis for voyages in some regions without sufficient data no grouping strategy is deployed for the sake of accuracy defined as g0 such as the one between gulf and south west europe the rest of grouping strategies in two different oceans is listed in tables 2 and 3 respectively 5 case study results and discussions in this section we use two specific cases in different ocean regions for the identification of the most navigated routes based on the method described in section 2 fig 10 illustrates the cleaned ais data distribution of the two cases including the one with voyages from gulf to east northeast asia a size of 2663 ais points and the other from the north sea west europe to gulf a size of 7267 ais points data in both local regions and other irrelevant domains are filtered data grouping strategies are applied in advance accounting for the influential parameters as described in section 4 the trained clusters by dbscan in gulf local region are showed and discussed from where connection points are extracted the identified navigated routes in the open sea passages from the two cases are illustrated besides the results of clustering data through kmeans are showed so as to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this selection method 5 1 identification of connection points connection points are not only served as an important role to tie the selected navigated routes in open sea passages and local regions but also can be used for local distance calculation using dbscan a hyperparameter tuning is first conducted in order to select the best parameters for model training fig 11 illustrates the comparison diagram of silhouette scores accounting for different combinations of minpts and eps ϵ the considered minimum number of points within a cluster minpts is between 1 and 250 with an increment of 1 in each training while the eps distance is between 2 km and 14 km with an increment of 2 km in each training it is found that the highest accuracy in terms of the silhouette score is 0 335 in gulf region as indicated by the p point hence the corresponding minpts value of 111 and the eps ϵ value of 14 km are selected for models training the haversine metric is adopted to calculate the great cycle distance between two points on a sphere fig 12 illustrates the clusters which have been trained for the local sea passages in gulf through the dbscan the tiny black dots in the left image denote all the noises not belonged to any clusters while all the clusters are in colours in the right image the geographical locations of centroids of all clusters are extracted considering as connection points e g a b f the arrows indicate the possible directions local voyages could pass through note that the original data distribution in local region has multiple and varying densities which compromises the training accuracy of clusters therefore the route selection cannot simply rely on the training results of algorithm instead practical experience is needed to identify major connections e g panama canal so as to find all effective connection points meanwhile some clusters close to terminals ports are irrelevant which have been manually removed for identifying connection points other unsupervised learning algorithms could also be applied which we have not discussed in detail in this paper for instance the kmeans algorithm could be adopted but it is obviously impractical for this case due to the requirement of prescribed number of clusters as described in section 2 3 1 another simple simulation with balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies birch algorithm pedregosa et al 2011 has been conducted the birch is a clustering algorithm which summaries large datasets into small and dense regions called clustering feature entries in this way it will provide an efficient running time when the size of datasets increases two critical parameters are needed during training namely the threshold which defines the maximum number of entries in each leaf node and the branching factor which is to specify the maximum number of data points in each sub cluster applying this algorithm for connection points training we conducted a hyperparameter tuning in terms of branching factor with the range between 2 and 200 and the threshold with the range between 1 and 50 however we found that no clear clusters can be identified for this type of dataset the major reason is that the noise points as illustrated in fig 12 could not be properly excluded such that the algorithm will always consider the entire group of data points as a single cluster for the sake of clarity no images are listed and further investigation for detailed comparisons among different unsupervised learning algorithms to identify connection points will be done in the future 5 2 identification of navigated routes fig 13 shows the most navigated routes in two cases as seen in fig 10 with the historical selection probabilities the probability is calculated through the number of route pattern nodes in each cluster and the overall number of route pattern nodes in each data group as seen in fig 14 the utilizing of such historical probability can provide an intuition of how people actually chose their ways during journeys under different weather conditions for instance if a ship transports goods from somewhere in gulf region to somewhere in south korea no doubt it will first pass through panama canal a connection point b is set here as seen in fig 12 then there are three options to choose one route is going to the north of pacific ocean probability of 0 08 and passing the tsugaru strait in japan a connection point is set here to local sea region then all the way to the final destination the second route is going to the south of pacific ocean close to hawaii islands probability of 0 62 and passing the area close to kagoshima in japan another connection point to the local sea region then all the way to the final destination the third route is the one between the former two routes with a probability of 0 30 therefore such route library is capable of providing plausible voyage references without suffering risks due to unknowns and hazard sea regions based on these routes the journey distances as well as other information relevant to the pre fixture stage can be easily estimated using kmeans to identify routes the number of clusters should be manually determined in advance the training strategy here we adopted is to compare the silhouette scores among models with different number of given clusters as seen in fig 14 the clusters of voyage pattern nodes in two cases are properly identified with respective silhouette score of 0 55 and 0 44 when setting the number of clusters to 3 the scores reflect a reasonable categorization of the voyage patterns from the standpoint of engineering however there are some limitations by using this algorithm for instance the number of clusters have to be manually determined in advance which may cause an inappropriate estimation due to human factors for the simplification of voyages we used pattern nodes other methods to identify trajectory similarities could be also adopted such as md and dtw which will be done in the future research 6 conclusion remarks in this paper a practical data driven methodology for route selections has been proposed a route library is therefore obtained based on ais data of tankers within 5 years which can be used for voyage planning and distance estimation by shipping companies at the pre fixture stage the speed weighted geolocation method is first used to obtain all the pattern nodes of voyages then the kmeans is adopted to classify pattern nodes into different clusters the nodes close to the centroids of clusters are selected as the representative routes in open sea passages simultaneously connection points in local sea passages have been trained by dbscan combining the representative routes with connection points the most navigated routes among ports are formed two cases have been showed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method the route library selected by this method with accurate journey distance information is capable of providing voyage references for shipping industry to support their decision making at the pre fixture stage in this work the accuracy of using the sophisticated ml algorithm dbscan to train connection points in local sea passages is not high due to uneven ais data distribution expert manual intervention is needed to further ensure a meaningful selection hence a possible future work should focus on other methods which can be more effective to identify connection points in local regions meanwhile the current work and findings are only based on tanker vessels the application of the methodology on other types of vessels such as container ships is therefore could be done in the future in addition comparison investigation with the existing routes from pilot charts or the shortest routes used by shipping companies should be conducted so as to further explore the utilizing of the method the quality of route library may be therefore improved finally the investigation of pattern nodes and route similarities accounting for more sailing parameters using other algorithms methods is needed which will further facilitate the improvement

20380,in tramp shipping a preliminary route is required for voyage planning at the pre fixture stage before a chartering contract is agreed such routes are conventionally designated by using pilot

delivering 80 of all goods gloabally metcalfe et al 2018 in tramp shipping when a cargo is to be transported the shipping company must estimate the voyage cost based on a preliminary route and bid for a contract a misguided route may substantially impair their competitiveness as a consequence conventionally reference routes are designated by using pilot charts or software considering long term statistical weather brooks and faust 2018 in this way uncertainties will always be introduced due to human factors such as the insufficient experience of staff in the chartering department especially

programmed in advance into the ais system when commissioning the vessels while dynamic information e g longitude latitude speed course time stamp and others is the real time information based on sensors the semi static information is the voyage related data such as the sailing distance loading condition destination and others which may be manually added and modified the utilizing of ais data on maritime research has largely proved itself in past decades le tixerant et al 2018 svanberg et al 2019 the majority of research has focused on maritime traffic analysis in narrow and congested waterways since the ais from the beginning was based on vhf very high frequency signals not satellites schelmedine shelmerdine 2015 conducted an initial analysis of ais data within one year in shetland region zhang et al 2018 extracted turning nodes and then built navigation routes network using these turning points in the qiongzhou strait based on ais data chen et al 2015 extracted a principal fairway in taiwan strait altan and otay 2017 studied the maritime traffic of ships at the strait of istanbul based on data over one year different data features were statistically analysed including the number of ship distribution ship types speeds and courses several researchers have investigated trajectory similarities based on ais data using different techniques gonzalez et al 2007 chen et al 2011 such as machine learning granlund and knutsson 2013 jelinek 1997 bishop 2006 lecun et al 2015 agamennoni et al 2010 shalev shwartz and ben david 2014 and dynamic time warping dtw myers et al 1980 to identity similarities ismail and vigneron ismail and vigneron 2015 proposed the merge distance md algorithm for the measuring of similarity between route trajectories li et al 2018 measured the trajectory similarity through md and then re sampled a representative dataset based on the similarity matrix the new representative dataset was clustered by dbscan ester et al 1996 schubert et al 2017 to obtain points for navigated routes han and yang 2020 calculated the route similarities accounting for voyage directions and vessel geographical locations however the investigation of spatial voyage routes in open seas with long legs larger than 3000 nm is rare the voyage route selections related to satellite based ais data are quite new meanwhile the shipping industry has been searching for different ways of selecting a proper navigated route at the pre fixture stage for a better commercial bidding an option is to simply use the shortest route in a region but it may result in a route which is most likely too short and thereby causes too low cost estimation alternatively the most navigated routes representing typical historical voyage patterns should be proposed for practical utilizing according to the needs of shipping companies therefore in this paper a route selection method is developed together with ml techniques based on ais data in order to select the most navigated routes aiming to facilitate the decision making at the pre fixture stage a route library is established based on global ais data of tankers within a five years period the structure of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we construct a methodology for the identification of the most navigated routes using ais data in section 3 we do scoping cleaning preparation and detailed investigation of five years of tanker shipping ais data based on the analysis we in section 4 propose grouping of ships and voyages to improve the model performance in section 5 we present and discuss the final results of two cases and the performance of our models and derive a statistical distribution of the most navigated routes for specific subgroups of tankers and voyages depending on seasonality size and loading condition finally we draw the conclusions and propose suggestions for further research 2 methodology for constructing an ais based route library in order to construct an ais based route library for practical use a data driven methodology is developed in this paper due to the route structures suggested by the proposed method all voyages are firstly divided into two subsets namely the open sea passage and the local sea passage it can be further divided into departure and destination local sea passages details will be elaborated in section 3 2 using real ais datasets to extract the open sea passages a speed weighted geolocation method is proposed simplifying voyage trajectories into pattern nodes the kmeans algorithm is then deployed to classify the pattern nodes so as to find the representative routes in open sea passages simultaneously for the local sea passages the ais data are processed by dbscan algorithm to represent the route pattern with connection points the most navigated routes between ports are identified by combining the open sea representative routes and the local connection points therefore the data driven methodology and its general application steps for the identification of the most navigated routes are first described in section 2 1 under this logic the detailed descriptions of respective techniques adopted in this method are then presented from section 2 2 to section 2 3 the terminology used in this paper is described as follows the pattern nodes denote the extracted nodes which can represent voyage trajectories the connection points are defined as merging points of multiple voyage trajectories which can not only connect all open sea passages in common but also can be used for local distance estimate 2 1 data driven methodology and its application procedures the proposed data driven methodology for route identification consists of a speed weighted geolocation method to form pattern nodes see section 2 2 and two types of ml techniques dbscan and kmeans see section 2 3 fig 1 is the flowchart to illustrate the methodology and its application procedures the deployed techniques are highlighted in red note that in this methodology we simply apply the ml techniques without any improvements of the algorithms themselves since the current patterns are sufficient to identify routes from the standpoint of practice all dataset should be divided into local sea passages and open sea passages before training see fig 6 in section 3 2 for concrete cases detailed description of the flowchart is presented as follows connection points in local sea passages train connection points in local sea passages by dbscan and update the points when needed navigated routes in open sea passages compute pattern nodes based on speed weighted geolocation method then extract navigated routes by kmeans finally find the nodes voyages with the minimum distances close to cluster centroids the most navigated routes combine the navigated route in open sea and its corresponding connection points in local sea between journey departure and destination based on the most navigated routes relevant voyage information such as journey distance can be accurately estimated note that the training of connection points in local sea passages and the identification of navigated routes in open sea passages can be conducted simultaneously 2 2 speed weighted geolocation method since each voyage trajectory consists of a series of ais data points a pattern node should be extracted in order to standardize trajectory representation unlike other existing methods such as dtw and md to directly trace trajectory similarity the proposed method first simplifies the trajectory a two dimensional 2d spatial line into a node one dimensional spatial point accounting for the geographical positions of each ais data point x i j and y i j and vessel speeds v i j the coordinates of pattern nodes z i y and z i x are calculated to represent the i th 2d voyage trajectory as expressed by eq 1 x i j denotes the normalized j th ais position of vessels in terms of latitude in the i th single voyage while y i j denotes the normalized j th ais position of vessels in terms of longitude in the i th voyage the overall number of ais points in the i th voyage is n i note that geographical locations are normalized by their extreme values within the dataset the aim of using speed as a weight is to account for the speed variation during a voyage and also to increase the data size in terms of distribution in the same sea region so as to have a better identification by kmeans as illustrated in fig 2 for example a ship can sail from connection point 1 cp1 to connection point 2 cp2 with four different options indicated by different colours using this method the corresponding pattern nodes of four voyages are a b c and d respectively 1 z i y j 1 n i y i j v i j n z i x j 1 n i x i j v i j n in this way all the pattern nodes of ship trajectories in an open sea area can be computed forming a new dataset representing all possible routes afterwards with the new dataset the kmeans algorithm shalev shwartz and ben david 2014 is adopted to find similar clusters and the node close to the centre of each cluster would be selected as one of the navigated routes euclidean distance is used to find the centre points it should be noted that a limitation exists for the application of this method for instance the number of ais points for routes in the same open sea regions are not often identical with varied speeds theoretically excessively large speeds may separate such pattern nodes into different clusters and thereby cause bad or wrong route selections however in practice it rarely happens since the average sailing speeds are quite similar one remedy is to remove all speed outliers during data cleaning meanwhile we further divide original dataset into several subsets so that such discrepancies may be reduced as described in section 3 2 2 3 unsupervised machine learning algorithms the unsupervised machine learning ml algorithms kmeans and dbscan are deployed together with the speed weighted geolocation method to find the most navigated routes a brief description of these two algorithms are presented in this section 2 3 1 kmeans the kmeans algorithm shalev shwartz and ben david 2014 attempts to minimize the average squared distance of the representative object to all the other objects x in the same clusters as expressed by eq 2 in this objective function the trained dataset is partitioned into sets c 1 c k where μ i is the centroid of the partitioned clusters c i d x μ i 2 is the square distance of each point x in a given set to the centroid of its cluster 2 l k m e a n s m i n j 1 k x c i d x μ i 2 the number of clusters k is the parameter needed in a kmeans algorithm in practice it is often up to the user to choose the parameter k that is the most suitable number for given clustering problems a simple iterative algorithm is normally applied to minimize the kmeans objective cost in the iterative procedure the k value is first given so as to partition the overall dataset initialization is then performed with a randomly chosen centroids μ i μ k for any points in given clusters the distance between points and their centroids are calculated update of the centroid is iteratively performed based on the summation of all the distance until the solution is converged in this paper kmeans algorithm is used to select the representative navigated routes by finding clusters and their centres 2 3 2 dbscan density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan algorithm is a density based unsupervised clustering algorithm initially proposed by ester et al 1996 it has been widely implemented and is available in popular toolkits such as scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 a simple density level estimation is used in dbscan based on a threshold for the number of neighbours minpts within a given radius ϵ three basic concepts including core points border points and noise are defined through the points interaction relationship such as direct density reachability density reachability and others as illustrated in fig 3 in this case the parameter m i n p t s is 4 and the radius distance ϵ is indicated by all the circles point n is a noise point because it is not density reachable from any other points point a is a core point while points b and c are border points the black arrows indicate direct density reachability points b and c are only density connected since both of them are density reachable from a based on such concept definitions the basic algorithm of dbscan can be simply described the database is first linearly scanned for objects not been processed the non core points are assigned to noise when a core point is discovered its neighbours are iteratively expanded and added to a cluster when encountered later by the linear scan objects that have been assigned to a cluster will then be skipped border points are normally assigned to the first cluster they are reachable from in the original algorithm thus the result of applying such dbscan algorithm is deterministic but may change a little if the dataset is permuted dbscan is used in this paper to train the connection points in local sea passages in order to evaluate the training accuracy of model clustering by ml techniques the metric of silhouette coefficient rousseeuw 1987 is used which is a measurement of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters the score ranges between 1 and 1 where a high value indicates that the clustering configuration is appropriate from the standpoint of practice the score approaching 0 4 is considered acceptable in this paper 3 ais data scoping modelling and analysis two original ais datasets of tankers are explored in the present analysis it includes one with daily recordings from january 2014 to march 2019 and the other with hourly recordings from december 2018 to september 2020 data details containing ais static information e g ship name and ship size dynamic information e g speed longitude and latitude and semi static information voyage distance and destinations are available for use the datasets are first described cleaned and visualized then dividing strategy of data is elaborated preparing for further route selections by the methodology introduced in section 2 the analyses of influential factors of shipping are conducted in section 3 3 3 1 data scoping cleansing and preparation in order to better explore data the entire datasets are visualized as seen in figs 4 and 5 fig 4 illustrates the density map of all the tanker voyages through daily ais dataset within 5 years in this route library the voyages with long leg larger than 3000 nm are the only focuses thus any voyages less than 3000 nm will be filtered in advance there are main regions with high voyage density such as voyages from us to europe and voyages from asia to gulf more than 500000 voyages from 4600 ships are finally included in the dataset which consists of six million daily positions and their corresponding information the number of terminals ports are 3288 in total which have been roughly classified into 518 main port and 25 main regions meanwhile the high frequency ais dataset with hourly based recordings of a selected tanker fleet is available as seen in the density map in fig 5 this dataset has for all voyages 776 000 hourly positions and is only used to identify connection points of local sea passages for the sake of accuracy no filter of voyages is needed missing data such as the journey distance are also fixed by recalculation based on the voyage geographical locations furthermore wrongly assigned terminal names are observed due to the mistakenly input by crews duplicates terminals have been found in different countries for instance the terminal name of damen ship repair belongs to either the netherlands or france which has introduced ambiguity in the data grouping all these observed data problems are fixed before further utilizing 3 2 data division into local versus open sea passages for every major region the ais data are manually divided into three subsets as described in section 2 namely the departure local sea passage the open sea passage and the destination local sea passage specifically the subset of open sea passages is only used for the selection of the navigated routes the subsets of local seas passages are used to train common connection points note that the data in local sea passages are not the daily ais positions but the hourly high frequency data in order to identify connection points with high accuracy as a result the two datasets should have the same cutting boundary so that the final selected voyages would not overlap the determination of the cutting boundary is flexible based on the observation of data distribution and the shape of local territories since it will not affect too much on the methods application as seen in fig 6 two cases are presented to elaborate the data division strategy including the left one between gulf and east northeast asia and the right one between gulf and west europe the local passages are indicated by the black boxes while the open sea passages are the rest of the voyages it has been observed that the voyages in local passages have regular patterns with common connection points determined by the density of voyages distribution as shown by the red dots combining the selected open sea route with the extracted connection points the most navigated routes in a given region are found examples of them are also highlighted as seen from route a to route d 3 3 analysis of parameters influencing ship routes in this section we investigate the impact of seasonality ship size and loading condition on executed routes of voyages based on ais data in open sea passages the clarifying of their effects on the voyage execution facilitates a better data grouping to identify the most navigated routes 3 3 1 vessel seasonality analysis as stated by shelmerdine 2015 processing ais data on a monthly basis is found to be highly beneficial as it allowed greater flexibility for future outputs and provided a manageable quantity of data for analysis hence the dataset is also analysed monthly to consider the seasonality effect searching for the tendency of route variations fig 7 shows an example of the seasonal distribution of voyages from the gulf region to the east northeast asia region across the pacific ocean the ais data in local sea passages are intentionally removed four temporal periods are aggregated by months including december to february march to april may to august and september to november it is found that crews chose more routes towards the south in winter time in the pacific ocean e g voyages from december to february compared with summer time e g voyages from may to august voyage distribution in the period from march to april presents a pattern similar to the one from december to february routes from september to november gradually moved to the northern part of the ocean presenting heavy density in the middle region close to hawaii islands therefore it can be briefly concluded that the route choice pattern varies with seasonality dataset should be grouped based on such voyage differences in different temporal periods 3 3 2 vessel loading condition analysis the change of loading conditions during vessel operations will affect their seakeeping ability faltinsen 1993 the operational draft of vessels varies during sailing affecting the voyage routes in seas when encountering different sea states however the ais dataset only roughly indicates whether a voyage is in a laden condition or a ballast condition hence the effect of draft variation will not be considered during sailing instead only the two loading conditions are used indicated by 1 for laden condition and 0 for ballast condition in the ais dataset respectively note that the loading condition is a parameter which crews manually put into system during sailing therefore data errors are unavoidable as a consequence fig 8 illustrates the distribution of route patterns between gulf and east northeast asia region in different loading conditions where the orange points denote all voyages in laden condition and the red points denote all voyages in ballast condition it is found that the majority of data are labelled as laden condition for instance 68 of voyages from east northeast asia to gulf and 99 9 of voyages from gulf to east northeast asia therefore no further data grouping is conducted for voyages in ballast condition due to limited number of data 3 3 3 ship size analysis the size of vessels in terms of cargo carrying capacity may affect the route selections in practical journey especially when encountering bad weather in practice there are two basic types of oil tankers hsu et al 2015 crude tankers and product tankers based on the further recommendation of shipping companies in this project seven standard ship types small mr1 mr2 handy lr1 lr2 and aframax are adopted without considering the specific vessel functions whatever crude or product tankers each type corresponds to a specific size range based on their carrying capacities for instance lr1 type is between 60000 dwt and 84999 dwt in the dataset the overall tanker size ranges between 25000 dead weight metric ton dwt and 120000 dwt as seen in the second column of table 1 the raw information of ship types from dataset is listed including 21 different types in total in order to consider ship size in a manageable way so that the identified results can be generalized in practice the original vessel types have been updated into the corresponding standard types note that during this process the vessel types with few number of data are manually changed into other similar type with sufficient number of data e g panamax mt dirty to lr1 standard type for the sake of model accuracy due to the limited data scale in each region we further aggregate the standard vessel categorizes based on data analysis as seen in fig 9 it illustrates the effect of ship size on the variations of voyage selections three types lr2 mr2 and small are visualized for comparison in the atlantic ocean it is observed that the larger vessels e g lr2 are more prone to use stable routes in regions close to the northern ocean compared with the smaller ones e g small some of the routes in small and mr2 types are gradually moving to the southern region presenting larger scatters in distribution compared with the lr2 type this phenomenon demonstrates the weak seakeeping performance and relatively well manoeuvrability of vessels in smaller size trying to following a more suitable routes when encountering adverse factors in seas such as bad weather therefore it is reasonable for us to recategorize the vessel type due to limited data scale only two new categories of ship type are defined for further route selections in this paper namely large type incl aframax lr2 and lr2 roughly between 60000 dwt and 125000 dwt and small type incl small handy mr1 and mr2 roughly between 25000 dwt and 59999 dwt 4 prioritizing voyage groups for further route investigation in this section the voyages in two major oceans the pacific ocean and the atlantic ocean are grouped based on the data analysis results in section 3 as a result there are two major grouping systems for voyages in the pacific ocean and voyages in the atlantic ocean respectively the difference is largely due to the different weather patterns observed from data analysis for voyages in some regions without sufficient data no grouping strategy is deployed for the sake of accuracy defined as g0 such as the one between gulf and south west europe the rest of grouping strategies in two different oceans is listed in tables 2 and 3 respectively 5 case study results and discussions in this section we use two specific cases in different ocean regions for the identification of the most navigated routes based on the method described in section 2 fig 10 illustrates the cleaned ais data distribution of the two cases including the one with voyages from gulf to east northeast asia a size of 2663 ais points and the other from the north sea west europe to gulf a size of 7267 ais points data in both local regions and other irrelevant domains are filtered data grouping strategies are applied in advance accounting for the influential parameters as described in section 4 the trained clusters by dbscan in gulf local region are showed and discussed from where connection points are extracted the identified navigated routes in the open sea passages from the two cases are illustrated besides the results of clustering data through kmeans are showed so as to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this selection method 5 1 identification of connection points connection points are not only served as an important role to tie the selected navigated routes in open sea passages and local regions but also can be used for local distance calculation using dbscan a hyperparameter tuning is first conducted in order to select the best parameters for model training fig 11 illustrates the comparison diagram of silhouette scores accounting for different combinations of minpts and eps ϵ the considered minimum number of points within a cluster minpts is between 1 and 250 with an increment of 1 in each training while the eps distance is between 2 km and 14 km with an increment of 2 km in each training it is found that the highest accuracy in terms of the silhouette score is 0 335 in gulf region as indicated by the p point hence the corresponding minpts value of 111 and the eps ϵ value of 14 km are selected for models training the haversine metric is adopted to calculate the great cycle distance between two points on a sphere fig 12 illustrates the clusters which have been trained for the local sea passages in gulf through the dbscan the tiny black dots in the left image denote all the noises not belonged to any clusters while all the clusters are in colours in the right image the geographical locations of centroids of all clusters are extracted considering as connection points e g a b f the arrows indicate the possible directions local voyages could pass through note that the original data distribution in local region has multiple and varying densities which compromises the training accuracy of clusters therefore the route selection cannot simply rely on the training results of algorithm instead practical experience is needed to identify major connections e g panama canal so as to find all effective connection points meanwhile some clusters close to terminals ports are irrelevant which have been manually removed for identifying connection points other unsupervised learning algorithms could also be applied which we have not discussed in detail in this paper for instance the kmeans algorithm could be adopted but it is obviously impractical for this case due to the requirement of prescribed number of clusters as described in section 2 3 1 another simple simulation with balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies birch algorithm pedregosa et al 2011 has been conducted the birch is a clustering algorithm which summaries large datasets into small and dense regions called clustering feature entries in this way it will provide an efficient running time when the size of datasets increases two critical parameters are needed during training namely the threshold which defines the maximum number of entries in each leaf node and the branching factor which is to specify the maximum number of data points in each sub cluster applying this algorithm for connection points training we conducted a hyperparameter tuning in terms of branching factor with the range between 2 and 200 and the threshold with the range between 1 and 50 however we found that no clear clusters can be identified for this type of dataset the major reason is that the noise points as illustrated in fig 12 could not be properly excluded such that the algorithm will always consider the entire group of data points as a single cluster for the sake of clarity no images are listed and further investigation for detailed comparisons among different unsupervised learning algorithms to identify connection points will be done in the future 5 2 identification of navigated routes fig 13 shows the most navigated routes in two cases as seen in fig 10 with the historical selection probabilities the probability is calculated through the number of route pattern nodes in each cluster and the overall number of route pattern nodes in each data group as seen in fig 14 the utilizing of such historical probability can provide an intuition of how people actually chose their ways during journeys under different weather conditions for instance if a ship transports goods from somewhere in gulf region to somewhere in south korea no doubt it will first pass through panama canal a connection point b is set here as seen in fig 12 then there are three options to choose one route is going to the north of pacific ocean probability of 0 08 and passing the tsugaru strait in japan a connection point is set here to local sea region then all the way to the final destination the second route is going to the south of pacific ocean close to hawaii islands probability of 0 62 and passing the area close to kagoshima in japan another connection point to the local sea region then all the way to the final destination the third route is the one between the former two routes with a probability of 0 30 therefore such route library is capable of providing plausible voyage references without suffering risks due to unknowns and hazard sea regions based on these routes the journey distances as well as other information relevant to the pre fixture stage can be easily estimated using kmeans to identify routes the number of clusters should be manually determined in advance the training strategy here we adopted is to compare the silhouette scores among models with different number of given clusters as seen in fig 14 the clusters of voyage pattern nodes in two cases are properly identified with respective silhouette score of 0 55 and 0 44 when setting the number of clusters to 3 the scores reflect a reasonable categorization of the voyage patterns from the standpoint of engineering however there are some limitations by using this algorithm for instance the number of clusters have to be manually determined in advance which may cause an inappropriate estimation due to human factors for the simplification of voyages we used pattern nodes other methods to identify trajectory similarities could be also adopted such as md and dtw which will be done in the future research 6 conclusion remarks in this paper a practical data driven methodology for route selections has been proposed a route library is therefore obtained based on ais data of tankers within 5 years which can be used for voyage planning and distance estimation by shipping companies at the pre fixture stage the speed weighted geolocation method is first used to obtain all the pattern nodes of voyages then the kmeans is adopted to classify pattern nodes into different clusters the nodes close to the centroids of clusters are selected as the representative routes in open sea passages simultaneously connection points in local sea passages have been trained by dbscan combining the representative routes with connection points the most navigated routes among ports are formed two cases have been showed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method the route library selected by this method with accurate journey distance information is capable of providing voyage references for shipping industry to support their decision making at the pre fixture stage in this work the accuracy of using the sophisticated ml algorithm dbscan to train connection points in local sea passages is not high due to uneven ais data distribution expert manual intervention is needed to further ensure a meaningful selection hence a possible future work should focus on other methods which can be more effective to identify connection points in local regions meanwhile the current work and findings are only based on tanker vessels the application of the methodology on other types of vessels such as container ships is therefore could be done in the future in addition comparison investigation with the existing routes from pilot charts or the shortest routes used by shipping companies should be conducted so as to further explore the utilizing of the method the quality of route library may be therefore improved finally the investigation of pattern nodes and route similarities accounting for more sailing parameters using other algorithms methods is needed which will further facilitate the improvement

20381,arctic platforms have sloped surfaces near waterline to reduce the ice impact on the structure by ice failure in bending in this paper authors developed a computer program which can solve the dynamic interactions between moored floating platforms and drifting level ice in time domain to model the fracture of level ice the discrete element method with the parallel bonding model is employed the hydrodynamics of moored platform is solved by time domain boundary element method to solve the fully coupled ice floater mooring dynamics the two computer programs are externally coupled at each time step a series of numerical simulations are performed with varying ice velocities the time series and spectra of the ice loads and platform motions are obtained both in time and frequency domains and their statistical values are compared with those from the experimental data the simulated results are also compared with simpler theoretical methods for fixed conical structures the mean and maximum values from the present simulations are compared reasonably well against the experimental results considering all kinds of uncertainties related to model ice properties and randomness non repeatability of breaking and fragmentation interesting physics of ice force lock in near some range of surge natural frequency is successfully illustrated by the present numerical simulation keywords kulluk shaped arctic floating platform drifting level ice discrete element method parallel bonding method ice forces fully coupled ice floater mooring dynamics simulation vs experiment lock in 1 introduction as plenty of oil gas in arctic region is discovered a new design of arctic platform with inverted conical shape has been proposed for deep arctic water because of its breaking capability against drifting ice sheets the sloped surface around the mean water level breaks ice through bending and thus the corresponding ice impact on the structure can be reduced consequently in 2010 as response to the offshore industry s demand the international standard iso 19906 2010 was published to address the design requirements and assessments for offshore structures in arctic regions however only limited information was given for floating structures for the safety and structural integrity of a floating structure in ice conditions reasonably accurate assessments of ice loads are of prime importance since ice loading is usually the dominant design load however there still exist complexities and uncertainties related to the modeling of ice structure interaction sayed and barker 2011 using a pic particle in cell method based on a hybrid lagrangian eulerian formulation sayed and barker 2011 performed 2d simulations for the elastic spring supported structure with ice cover zhou et al 2012 also conducted 2d simulations for the interaction between level ice and a moored ship with heading control with the semi empirical model they studied the influences of the turret position ice thickness speed and mooring stiffness on structural motions and concluded that the numerical results were in good agreement with the full scale measurements the station keeping of floating structures under the pack ice conditions is also broadly researched numerically and experimentally wright et al 1998 hansen and løset 1999 barker et al 2000 sun and shen 2012 metrikin et al 2015 liu and ji 2018 in regard to the interaction between level ice and a sloped structure the complex and random process of the ice facture is involved to investigate this phenomenon several numerical simulation methods were used based on the elastic beam theory the simplified analytical method was employed by aksnes 2010 for the level ice ship interaction considering the breaking rotating and sliding phases of ice the analogous approaches were adopted in lu et al 2014a and jang et al 2016 and the ice load on a sloped structure was estimated the cohesive element method cem which is an extension of cohesive zone model czm in fem simulations was also used to model the fracture of level ice in lu et al 2014b and wang et al 2018 by modeling the cohesive elements on the face between the adjacent bulk elements the internal stress along the cohesive element was evaluated over the interaction for the ice fracture in addition the combined 2d finite element method fem discrete element method dem was used in paavilainen et al 2009 2011 the ice fracture was modeled by the fem while the contact forces and interactions between broken ices were computed by the dem however the interaction between the moored floating structure and level ice in particular has rarely been investigated yet in this study the 3d dem with the parallel bonding model is employed for level ice to mimic the realistic ice fracture it is coupled with the in house hull mooring coupled dynamic analysis program charm3d e g kim et al 2005 koo and kim 2005 jang and kim 2019 to analyze the level ice interactions with the moored floating offshore structure a much simpler approach was attempted by authors jang et al 2016 to roughly estimate the ice loading on an arctic spar the dem was also employed to estimate ice loading on fixed arctic structures jang and kim 2021 in this paper the dem coupled method is further extended to solve its interaction with moored floating platforms by using the developed ice platform interaction program the motions of the floating structure subjected to the level ice load are solved in time domain under various ice drift velocity conditions the dynamic ice load and its crack patterns are simulated by time marching method and the corresponding animations are visually demonstrated the structure s responses corresponding to varying dynamic ice loads are assessed and discussed the statistical values of ice forces are compared with the 1 45 scaled experimental data nixon and ettema 1988 and those by simplified theoretical methods for fixed structures ralston 1980 croasdale et al 1994 2 numerical method in this section the numerical method for the interaction between level ice and a floating structure is discussed the numerical simulation in time domain has been achieved by the coupling the in house program charm3d and the open source program liggghts kloss et al 2012 charm3d developed by the second author s research group is suitable to analyze a floating structure with mooring lines considering the hydrodynamic effects and nonlinear wave forces it has been extensively validated verified over two past decades on the other hand liggghts which is a parallel computing simulator for particle s dynamics based on the dem is a useful and powerful to model level ice with multiple particles and estimate the ice impact on the structure the first author has coupled the two programs to analyze a fully coupled ice floater mooring dynamics in the time domain 2 1 dynamics of a floating structure in charm3d the 6 dof motions of a floating structure are evaluated in the time domain considering hydrodynamic effects of added mass radiation damping and hydrostatic coefficients those coefficients are computed using a panel based 3d diffraction and radiation program wamit 2006 in the frequency domain and inputted into charm3d the equation of a floating structure motion is as follows 1 m m a d d ς t k h y d r o ς t f n o n l i n e a r d r a g t f

2004 the parallel bonding model is employed to consider the bonding relation among particles the interacting forces on the linked particles are calculated based on the elastic deformation of a bonding

implementation external coupling between charm3d and liggghts in this study we use the well developed in house code charm3d which is suitable for floating platform s dynamics interacting with fluid and mooring lines this code is coupled to the dem solver liggghts which model level ice as an assembly of many spherical particles using the parallel bonding model the first author has coupled two programs using the external coupling method the two programs run individually but by sharing the data externally through the computer memory system they feed and obtain the necessary data from to each other to achieve external coupling between the two programs a named pipe method is employed this inter process communication ipc method is an extension of the traditional pipe concept it links two separate processes using a filesystem in unix so the two separate processes can access the named pipe at the same time and transfer the data to the other the named pipe is also called first in first out fifo because it has the function of organizing and manipulating the data buffer if one side of the program sends the data to the named pipe none of the processes sends the data anymore before the data in the named pipe is processed therefore if the two programs are set to have the same time interval in the simulation a time marching algorithm for both programs is not necessary because the named pipe itself provides the function of a data buffer since charm3d is a serial processing program written in fortran mpi coding is properly made in liggghts with c computational language charm3d provides 6 dof platform s kinematics to liggghts and liggghts feeds 6 dof ice forces and moments into charm3d as depicted in fig 2 3 numerical model and simulation setup in this study we compare and validate the numerical results against the experimental data obtained by nixon and ettema 1988 they conducted forty two experimental tests of a kulluk shaped moored platform subjected to the ice sheet load at iihr s ice towing tank the inverted conical shaped platform was the 1 45 scaled model of kulluk platform a leaf spring was used to account for the platform s surge stiffness and buoyancy induced restoring forces were considered for heave and pitch motions the ice sheets of thickness 20 30 and 40 mm were pushed to the model platform by a motorized carriage with varying velocities between 0 02 and 0 2 m s various ice conditions such as drift velocity thickness and flexural strength were applied to investigate these effects on the ice forces and the dynamic behavior of the platform 3 1 simulation of kulluk shaped floating platform by charm3d the current numerical model directly adopted the dimension of the model platform as explained in the aforementioned paper as benchmark it was also transformed to the prototype scale as listed in table 1 the only difference between the actual kulluk and the model platform used in experiment and simulation is the corner shape at the keel in that kulluk has skirts while the model platform has the flat shape as depicted in fig 3 using the 3d diffraction radiation panel program wamit the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated in the frequency domain the wide range of frequency is set to capture the asymptotic trend of the added mass terms the added masses at infinity frequency are approximately 10 and 180 of the platform s mass in surge and heave directions respectively due to the relatively large water plane area compared to the platform s draft and volume the heave added mass is larger than that in surge direction the 6 dof added mass values at the infinite frequency are inputted to charm3d for the ensuing time domain simulations first numerical free decay tests in the open water condition are performed to identify the platform s natural frequencies and hydrodynamic damping the simulated logarithmic decrement is compared with that from the experimental data the viscous damping in the numerical free decay test is modeled with morrison truss member with an effective diameter the drag coefficient of 1 5 is used fig 4 shows the free decay test results in surge heave and pitch directions with initial displacement of 5 m 1 m and 0 5 radian respectively all motions decay as time goes and oscillate with respective natural periods the natural frequencies and logarithmic decrements from the numerical simulation well match against the experimental results as shown in table 2 which verifies that the numerical model can be used for the subsequent study regarding the global performance of the floating platform with drifting level ice the discrepancy in heave natural period can mainly be attributed to the expected high nonlinearity associated with the rapidly varying water plane area near mean water level mwl 3 2 ice properties in dem the input parameters used in dem simulations such as elastic modulus poisson s ratio etc are mostly adopted from the physical properties of ice used in nixon and ettema 1988 experiment considering the proper scale law used for ice barker et al 2005 in this regard both experimental and full scale ice properties are given in table 3 the bonding strength which is an artificial parameter to mimic the bond relation among particles is determined by the numerical four point bending test as depicted in fig 5 total 336 particles are used and they bonded each other to form the ice beam whose size is l x h x b 12 m 1 25 m x 1 25 m the ice beam s height is the same as that used in the model test the spherical particles with 3 layers have a diameter d of 0 475 m based on eq 7 complying with hexagonal closed packing hcp pattern for the ice block geometry the procedure and validation of the numerical four point bending test were already explained and discussed in detail in the previous study by authors 2021 and other related papers ji et al 2017 di et al 2017 pradana and qian 2020 according to those references the modeling with 3 layers of discrete elements shows a good agreement with the experimental data in the case of the similar level ice and fixed conical structure the dem parameters used in this test is tabulated in table 4 7 d h 1 w 1 2 3 the two loading pins move upward with the constant velocity of 0 01 m s for the quasi static loading condition and force on two loading pins is measured a parametric numerical test is conducted and bending failure of ice beam is examined by gradually increasing the maximum bonding strength from 0 70 mpa to 0 85 mpa for better comparisons the averaged force applied on two loading pins are converted to mid span stress based on the elastic beam theory as follows 8 σ f l e x u r a l 3 f l l i 2 b h 2 fig 6 a shows the time flexural strength curve in that flexural strength linearly increases and then drops down to zero after the failure because of the shaking beam motion after the sudden breaking the residual force on loading pins is continuously observed fig 6 b indicates the deflection flexural strength curve from the slope m representing the linear relation between deflection and flexural strength one can calculate the young s modulus with following equation 9 e σ 3 l 2 4 c 2 12 h m as a result the maximum bonding strength of 0 80 mpa provides the best fit with the physical flexural strength of 1 135 mpa and the young modulus of 0 345 gpa is also well matched with the physical young s modulus of 0 342 gpa with these results the dem parameters are determined to match with the physical ice properties of experiment and then they are used in the rest of the numerical simulations 4 results and discussions based on the numerical settings in the previous sections the interaction of kulluk shaped floating platform subjected to the level ice impact is modeled using the coupled computer programs the hydrodynamic effects on the level ice in the dem simulation are considered by adding buoyancy and viscous forces in accordance with sun and shen 2012 fig 7 depicts the schematic view of the entire system with level ice the initial size of level ice is 400 m x 400 m x 1 25 m in length width and thickness respectively the level ice balanced with the buoyancy and gravity forces is around the water level according to the previous study by ji et al 2015 and pradana and qian 2020 the maximum ice load converges as long as the ice width is greater than 5 times the structure s diameter following their observation we determine the width of level ice to be 400 m which is about 6 times greater than kulluk s diameter at waterline the dem parameters are the same as those of the experiment as in table 4 according to previous studies di et al 2017 pradana and qian 2020 jang and kim 2021 the modeling with 3 layers of discrete elements shows a good agreement with the experimental data in the case of the interaction between fixed conical structure and level ice therefore we kept the same number of layers the dynamic interaction of the floating platform with the level ice is investigated with varying ice drift velocity of 0 13 0 27 0 67 and 1 34 m s the time step used in both simulators charm3d and dem is 0 0001 s complying with rayleigh time step criteria the total of 2 55 million particles are simulated one simulation requires approximately 2 days with 500 cores of 2 8 ghz intel ivy bridge ep due to the lack of space and need of huge additional computational resources the effects of other parameters such as ice thickness and ice strength will be discussed in the future study 4 1 visual observation fig 8 depicts the snapshots of the dynamic interaction between level ice and the structure with drifting velocity of 1 34 m s at the time instant of 100 s as the level ice approaches the structure the intact ice is continuously broken by bending and further breaks into multiple wedge shaped ice floes by hitting the structure from the visual animation of the simulation results the well known ice breaking procedure is observed including breaking rotating and sliding phases due to the relatively high ice drifting speed of 1 34 m s the broken pieces are accumulated in front of the structure with approximately 4 6 times the ice thickness they are subsequently cleared away while passing around the sides of the structure after that the broken ices move upward by buoyancy forces but they are coved by unbroken intact ice when the drifting velocity is low the length of broken pieces varies depending on the occurrence of secondary breaking mode in general the broken ice length by the first collision with the structure ranges about 5 9 times ice thickness which is close to that reported in the iso 19906 standard 2010 in dem simulations when the inter particle stress exceeds the critical bonding strength in either normal or tangential direction particles lose the bonding relations considering this formulation the crack patterns of level ice are investigated by drawing the bonding relation fig 9 shows the level ice crack patterns for the drift velocity of 0 27 m s with increasing time at the initial contact the radial crack at the center line occurs first and the circumferential crack follows which is similar to the case of small diameter cone shaped structure observed in xu et al 2015 then the wedge shaped broken pieces are formed and move along downstream however after the first crack the following cracks occur non simultaneously over the sloped surfaces and no more radial cracks at the centerline is observed which can also be found for the structure with a small diameter jang and kim 2021 because of the consecutive collisions among ice pieces and structure the final length of broken ice is smaller than that formed by the initial contact 4 2 structural motions and ice forces in time domain the time dependent ice forces and the corresponding structural displacements are investigated to identify the key features of interaction between the structure and level ice with constant ice drift velocity without waves the problem setting apparently looks like steady problem but dynamic ice loadings happen due to various patterns of ice breaking in time and time varying features of ice fragments around the hull fig 10 shows the surge heave ice forces and the corresponding surge motions with varying ice velocity at the low ice drift velocity of 0 13 m s the structure is gradually pushed by the momentum of moving ice and the corresponding ice force also increases accordingly when the intact ice breaks the peak ice force is observed and then it rapidly falls down around 250 s the detachment between the intact ice and the structure occurs when the structure moves faster than the ice which is consistent with the papers by aksnes 2010 and jang et al 2016 for this reason the maximum ice force in the x direction at the low drift speed is smaller than other cases the vertical force is strongly related to the geometrical consideration including the slope angle of the structure and the direction of the ice impact according to the iso 19906 2010 the vertical ice force acting on the fixed structure is calculated by scaling the horizontal force based on the structure s slope angle in the moored floating structure case due to the change in pitch motion the orientation of broken ice pieces and dynamic interaction with broken pieces at the first bending dominant initial stage up to 340 s it is shown that the vertical ice force signal deviates from that of horizontal ice force even showing the negative forces at certain time instant however after 340 s the vertical force shows the similar trend with the horizontal force which can be attributed to the combined ice forces with accumulated rubble ices after 200 s the surge displacement of the structure clearly shows the strong correlation with x dir ice force having the similar trends in time series which is the frequency lock in mode in the previous studies määttänen 1998 nord et al 2018 they reported that the offshore structure exposed by drifting ice experienced the ice induced motions at forcing frequency with large amplitude it happens at low drift velocities see fig 12 when it happens it can lead to significant fatigue damages on structures therefore identifying the hull dynamics and assessing the corresponding ice forces are very important for the design of arctic platforms even at low ice drifting speeds as the drifting velocity increases we do not observe the lock in phenomenon instead the surge motion frequencies become quite different from ice excitation frequencies the amplitudes of surge motion decrease and the ice force signals fluctuate faster at higher frequencies with the random and non periodic pattern in the case of drifting velocity at 1 34 m s the surge and heave ice forces show strong correlation with similar time series due to the accumulation of ice rubbles and the relatively high drift velocity the positive ice force is continuously applied to the structure in both x and z directions the structural motion in surge converges to an equilibrium position of 2 8 m with small fluctuations around it as ice drift speed increases from 0 13 m s to 1 34 m s the mean surge is increased but the dynamic surge is decreased 4 3 structural motion and ice force spectra next the psd power spectral density of ice force and surge heave motion corresponding to the above time series are given fig 11 shows the psd plots with varying ice drift velocities due to relatively smaller heave motions compared to the surge motions the heave motion spectra are scaled up by 1000 and 100 for better visualization at the low drift velocity of 0 13 and 0 27 m s the ice force induced frequency lock in modes are clearly observed i e the first two peaks of the surge motion and ice force in the x direction occur at the same frequency of 0 075 and 0 104 rad s respectively the vertical force and motion are also concentrated in the same frequency range showing their similar correlation at the intermediate drift velocity of 0 67 m s we start to see more peaks in both displacements and ice forces in higher frequency range at the highest speed of 1 34 m s more pronounced peaks in higher frequency range can be observed this is due to the fact that the ice breaking and ice rubble movements become faster at higher drift velocity the psd peaks are distributed over a wide range of frequencies which implies more random patterns as discussed before the locations of peak frequencies of x dir ice forces obtained from the numerical simulations are compared with those from the experiment by nixon and ettema 1988 in the figure the peaks of the numerical surge motions are also given for heuristic discussion the dominant peaks of surge motion are slightly increasing but remain close to the surge natural frequency of 0 18 rad s as shown in fig 12 however the peaks of x dir ice forces increase much faster toward higher frequencies as also observed in the experiment at low ice drift velocities 0 13 and 0 27 m s the lock in of ice induced force frequency close to surge natural frequency can be observed both in simulation and experiment at much higher drift velocities the differences between the major peaks of motion and ice force frequencies continue to increase we see a noticeable difference at 0 67 m s case which may be attributed to the uncertainty associated with the transition from the lock in mode to non lock in mode in the current simulation the ice properties such as flexural strength thickness young s modulus etc are assumed to be homogeneous and do not change over time which is not true in the experiment these properties determine the breaking length affecting the forcing frequency also the ice breaking and fragmentation processes are highly random and non repeatable so only qualitative comparisons are possible despite such uncertainties in the experiment and several assumptions and simplifications made in the numerical simulation the essential physics of level ice interaction with the given arctic floating platform with varying drift velocities seem to be captured 4 4 statistics of structural motions and ice forces the simulated maximum and mean values of ice forces are compared with the experimental data by nixon and ettema 1988 also two theoretical calculations based on the simplified methods proposed by ralston 1980 and croasdale et al 1994 are given as a reference the two analytical methods are recommended by iso 19906 2010 for fixed offshore structures ralston s method is based on the plastic plate theory while croasdale s method are based on the elastic beam theory with 3d effects replacing ice weight in air by ice buoyancy in water the ice impact on the downward breaking slopes can be calculated the croasdale s method considers five contributions to the horizontal ice force as follows 10 f h h b h p h r h l h t where fh is the horizontal ice force hb is the breaking force hp is the force required to push the sheet ice through the ice rubble hr is the load to push the ice blocks up the slope though the ice rubble hl is the force required to lift the ice rubble on top of the advancing ice sheet and ht is the force to turn the ice block at the top of the slope the variables used in eq 10 such as density rubble accumulation thickness ride up height and so on are obtained from ice properties and the visual observation from numerical simulations the detailed equations for each term can be found in iso 19906 2010 a 8 2 4 4 2 and a 8 2 4 4 3 the above two equations are for fixed structures and did not consider the effect of level ice drift velocity in fig 13 the mean values and standard deviations of x dir ice forces measured from the nixon s experiment 1988 are given and they are compared with those from the present numerical simulations the data for maximum forces are not directly given in nixon and ettema 1988 but they recommended that the maximum force can be predicted by mean force plus twice the standard deviation with 95 confidence level so the maximum forces by using that formula from both nixon s experiment and present simulation are also compared finally the averages of the three largest peaks of ice forces in the simulated time histories are also plotted as a reference when compared to the experimental data the simulated mean values are in good agreement while the maximum values show some differences in the simulation both mean and maximum values modestly increase with increasing ice drift velocity however in the experiment the mean and maximum values first decrease from 0 13 m s to 0 27 m s then continue to increase slightly from that point on the experimental and simulated maximum values agree well for 0 13 m s for larger ice velocities simulated values are larger than experimental values as pointed out earlier despite many uncertainties associated with the ice properties in the model ice and assumptions made in the numerical simulation as well as highly random and non repeatable ice breaking and fragmentation processes this kind of qualitative agreements between the experimental and simulated results look reasonable and essential physics appear to be captured the averages of the three largest peaks in the simulations become consistently larger than those from croasdale s maximal value formula which implies that the formula does not warrant conservatism the corresponding statistical data are summarized in table 5 in the same figure based on the analytical methods of ralston 1980 and croasdale et al 1994 the ice forces of 10 3 mn and 7 4 mn are computed respectively for the same but fixed platform the present numerical simulations are for compliant platform so the maximum forces are expected to be smaller than those for fixed platform as is shown in the figure according to huang 2010 when the ice breaks against the wide conical structure similar to this particular case the ice failure occurs non simultaneously which will reduce the maximum force the present numerical results seem consistent with his argument in fig 14 the corresponding bar graphs of vertical ice forces are given only simulated results are plotted since no experimental data is available the general trends of the statistical values with increasing drift velocity are similar to those of fig 13 the mean and maximum values increase with ice drift velocity while their standard deviations remain about the same the vertical force magnitudes are in general smaller about 2 3 than horizontal force magnitudes the corresponding statistical values are summarized in table 5 5 conclusions a series of numerical simulations were conducted for an arctic semi submersible subjected to drifting level ice by using the newly developed computer simulation program for the fully coupled ice floater mooring dynamics the external coupling between floater mooring dynamics in house program charm3d and ice mechanics dem open source program liggghts has been achieved by using the named pipe method and the necessary data are shared from to each other to mimic the realistic fracture of level ice the parallel bonding method was employed with an assembly of multiple spherical particles for the computational parameter representing the critical bonding strength the numerical four point beam test was conducted with the given ice properties used in physical experiments the numerical simulations were performed in the time domain with varying ice velocities and the results were compared with the experimental results of nixon and ettema 1988 in general the numerical simulations reasonably estimated the mean and maximum ice loads in the reasonable range of ice drift velocities in addition the computer simulations successfully recovered the ice force lock in phenomenon near surge natural frequency which has been observed in physical tests several important conclusions can be summarized as follows to setup the numerical tests equivalent to the physical experiment the numerical system identification was systematically done through free decay tests in time domain as a result the system stiffness natural frequencies and damping ratios were reasonably modeled the level ice modeling in the dem was performed by adopting the ice material properties directly from the experimental data and the artificial parameter representing the critical bonding strength was determined by the four point numerical bending test from the visual observation level ice fails in bending with multiple consecutive breaking the broken pieces are accumulated in front of the structure with 4 6 times the ice thickness at initial break the broken ice length is about 5 9 times the ice thickness it reveals that the hull shape significantly affects the accumulation of rubble ices the crack pattern is investigated and cracks occur non simultaneously over the wide conical structure the interactions between level ice and a floating structure show different modes with varying ice drift velocity at low ice speed the resonance type large amplitude oscillating motion of the floater is observed furthermore the ice force frequency is locked in motion s frequency in the range of ice velocity 0 13 0 27 m s showing the identical peaks in psd at higher ice speeds the ice loads contain higher frequency peaks and become more random and non periodic which results in smaller platform motion when the thickness of rubble ice is 3 5 times the ice thickness the maximum ice loads by ralston s and croasdale s theoretical methods developed for fixed structures are independently calculated since the floating platform is compliant the maximum ice forces by the present numerical simulations are smaller than those by the simplified formulas the mean and maximum values from the present simulations are compared reasonably well against nixon s experimental results considering all kinds of uncertainties related to model ice properties and randomness and non repeatability of breaking and fragmentation credit authorship contribution

20381,arctic platforms have sloped surfaces near waterline to reduce the ice impact on the structure by ice failure in bending in this paper authors developed a computer program which can solve the dynamic interactions between moored floating platforms and drifting level ice in time domain to model the fracture of level ice the discrete element method with the parallel bonding model is employed the hydrodynamics of moored platform is solved by time domain boundary element method to solve the fully coupled ice floater mooring dynamics the two computer programs are externally coupled at each time step a series of numerical simulations are performed with varying ice velocities the time series and spectra of the ice loads and platform motions are obtained both in time and frequency domains and their statistical values are compared with those from the experimental data the simulated results are also compared with simpler theoretical methods for fixed conical structures the mean and maximum values from the present simulations are compared reasonably well against the experimental results considering all kinds of uncertainties related to model ice properties and randomness non repeatability of breaking and fragmentation interesting physics of ice force lock in near some range of surge natural frequency is successfully illustrated by the present numerical simulation keywords kulluk shaped arctic floating platform drifting level ice discrete element method parallel bonding method ice forces fully coupled ice floater mooring dynamics simulation vs experiment lock in 1 introduction as plenty of oil gas in arctic region is discovered a new design of arctic platform with inverted conical shape has been proposed for deep arctic water because of its breaking capability against drifting ice sheets the sloped surface around the mean water level breaks ice through bending and thus the corresponding ice impact on the structure can be reduced consequently in 2010 as response to the offshore industry s demand the international standard iso 19906 2010 was published to address the design requirements and assessments for offshore structures in arctic regions however only limited information was given for floating structures for the safety and structural integrity of a floating structure in ice conditions reasonably accurate assessments of ice loads are of prime importance since ice loading is usually the dominant design load however there still exist complexities and uncertainties related to the modeling of ice structure interaction sayed and barker 2011 using a pic particle in cell method based on a hybrid lagrangian eulerian formulation sayed and barker 2011 performed 2d simulations for the elastic spring supported structure with ice cover zhou et al 2012 also conducted 2d simulations for the interaction between level ice and a moored ship with heading control with the semi empirical model they studied the influences of the turret position ice thickness speed and mooring stiffness on structural motions and concluded that the numerical results were in good agreement with the full scale measurements the station keeping of floating structures under the pack ice conditions is also broadly researched numerically and experimentally wright et al 1998 hansen and løset 1999 barker et al 2000 sun and shen 2012 metrikin et al 2015 liu and ji 2018 in regard to the interaction between level ice and a sloped structure the complex and random process of the ice facture is involved to investigate this phenomenon several numerical simulation methods were used based on the elastic beam theory the simplified analytical method was employed by aksnes 2010 for the level ice ship interaction considering the breaking rotating and sliding phases of ice the analogous approaches were adopted in lu et al 2014a and jang et al 2016 and the ice load on a sloped structure was estimated the cohesive element method cem which is an extension of cohesive zone model czm in fem simulations was also used to model the fracture of level ice in lu et al 2014b and wang et al 2018 by modeling the cohesive elements on the face between the adjacent bulk elements the internal stress along the cohesive element was evaluated over the interaction for the ice fracture in addition the combined 2d finite element method fem discrete element method dem was used in paavilainen et al 2009 2011 the ice fracture was modeled by the fem while the contact forces and interactions between broken ices were computed by the dem however the interaction between the moored floating structure and level ice in particular has rarely been investigated yet in this study the 3d dem with the parallel bonding model is employed for level ice to mimic the realistic ice fracture it is coupled with the in house hull mooring coupled dynamic analysis program charm3d e g kim et al 2005 koo and kim 2005 jang and kim 2019 to analyze the level ice interactions with the moored floating offshore structure a much simpler approach was attempted by authors jang et al 2016 to roughly estimate the ice loading on an arctic spar the dem was also employed to estimate ice loading on fixed arctic structures jang and kim 2021 in this paper the dem coupled method is further extended to solve its interaction with moored floating platforms by using the developed ice platform interaction program the motions of the floating structure subjected to the level ice load are solved in time domain under various ice drift velocity conditions the dynamic ice load and its crack patterns are simulated by time marching method and the corresponding animations are visually demonstrated the structure s responses corresponding to varying dynamic ice loads are assessed and discussed the statistical values of ice forces are compared with the 1 45 scaled experimental data nixon and ettema 1988 and those by simplified theoretical methods for fixed structures ralston 1980 croasdale et al 1994 2 numerical method in this section the numerical method for the interaction between level ice and a floating structure is discussed the numerical simulation in time domain has been achieved by the coupling the in house program charm3d and the open source program liggghts kloss et al 2012 charm3d developed by the second author s research group is suitable to analyze a floating structure with mooring lines considering the hydrodynamic effects and nonlinear wave forces it has been extensively validated verified over two past decades on the other hand liggghts which is a parallel computing simulator for particle s dynamics based on the dem is a useful and powerful to model level ice with multiple particles and estimate the ice impact on the structure the first author has coupled the two programs to analyze a fully coupled ice floater mooring dynamics in the time domain 2 1 dynamics of a floating structure in charm3d the 6 dof motions of a floating structure are evaluated in the time domain considering hydrodynamic effects of added mass radiation damping and hydrostatic coefficients those coefficients are computed using a panel based 3d diffraction and

2004 the parallel bonding model is employed to consider the bonding relation among particles the interacting forces on the linked particles are calculated based on the elastic deformation of a bonding

implementation external coupling between charm3d and liggghts in this study we use the well developed in house code charm3d which is suitable for floating platform s dynamics interacting with fluid and mooring lines this code is coupled to the dem solver liggghts which model level ice as an assembly of many spherical particles using the parallel bonding model the first author has coupled two programs using the external coupling method the two programs run individually but by sharing the data externally through the computer memory system they feed and obtain the necessary data from to each other to achieve external coupling between the two programs a named pipe method is employed this inter process communication ipc method is an extension of the traditional pipe concept it links two separate processes using a filesystem in unix so the two separate processes can access the named pipe at the same time and transfer the data to the other the named pipe is also called first in first out fifo because it has the function of organizing and manipulating the data buffer if one side of the program sends the data to the named pipe none of the processes sends the data anymore before the data in the named pipe is processed therefore if the two programs are set to have the same time interval in the simulation a time marching algorithm for both programs is not necessary because the named pipe itself provides the function of a data buffer since charm3d is a serial processing program written in fortran mpi coding is properly made in liggghts with c computational language charm3d provides 6 dof platform s kinematics to liggghts and liggghts feeds 6 dof ice forces and moments into charm3d as depicted in fig 2 3 numerical model and simulation setup in this study we compare and validate the numerical results against the experimental data obtained by nixon and ettema 1988 they conducted forty two experimental tests of a kulluk shaped moored platform subjected to the ice sheet load at iihr s ice towing tank the inverted conical shaped platform was the 1 45 scaled model of kulluk platform a leaf spring was used to account for the platform s surge stiffness and buoyancy induced restoring forces were considered for heave and pitch motions the ice sheets of thickness 20 30 and 40 mm were pushed to the model platform by a motorized carriage with varying velocities between 0 02 and 0 2 m s various ice conditions such as drift velocity thickness and flexural strength were applied to investigate these effects on the ice forces and the dynamic behavior of the platform 3 1 simulation of kulluk shaped floating platform by charm3d the current numerical model directly adopted the dimension of the model platform as explained in the aforementioned paper as benchmark it was also transformed to the prototype scale as listed in table 1 the only difference between the actual kulluk and the model platform used in experiment and simulation is the corner shape at the keel in that kulluk has skirts while the model platform has the flat shape as depicted in fig 3 using the 3d diffraction radiation panel program wamit the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated in the frequency domain the wide range of frequency is set to capture the asymptotic trend of the added mass terms the added masses at infinity frequency are approximately 10 and 180 of the platform s mass in surge and heave directions respectively due to the relatively large water plane area compared to the platform s draft and volume the heave added mass is larger than that in surge direction the 6 dof added mass values at the infinite frequency are inputted to charm3d for the ensuing time domain simulations first numerical free decay tests in the open water condition are performed to identify the platform s natural frequencies and hydrodynamic damping the simulated logarithmic decrement is compared with that from the experimental data the viscous damping in the numerical free decay test is modeled with morrison truss member with an effective diameter the drag coefficient of 1 5 is used fig 4 shows the free decay test results in surge heave and pitch directions with initial displacement of 5 m 1 m and 0 5 radian respectively all motions decay as time goes and oscillate with respective natural periods the natural frequencies and logarithmic decrements from the numerical simulation well match against the experimental results as shown in table 2 which verifies that the numerical model can be used for the subsequent study regarding the global performance of the floating platform with drifting level ice the discrepancy in heave natural period can mainly be attributed to the expected high nonlinearity associated with the rapidly varying water plane area near mean water level mwl 3 2 ice properties in dem the input parameters used in dem simulations such as elastic modulus poisson s ratio etc are mostly adopted from the physical properties of ice used in nixon and ettema 1988 experiment considering the proper scale law used for ice barker et al 2005 in this regard both experimental and full scale ice properties are given in table 3 the bonding strength which is an artificial parameter to mimic the bond relation among particles is determined by the numerical four point bending test as depicted in fig 5 total 336 particles are used and they bonded each other to form the ice beam whose size is l x h x b 12 m 1 25 m x 1 25 m the ice beam s height is the same as that used in the model test the spherical particles with 3 layers have a diameter d of 0 475 m based on eq 7 complying with hexagonal closed packing hcp pattern for the ice block geometry the procedure and validation of the numerical four point bending test were already explained and discussed in detail in the previous study by authors 2021 and other related papers ji et al 2017 di et al 2017 pradana and qian 2020 according to those references the modeling with 3 layers of discrete elements shows a good agreement with the experimental data in the case of the similar level ice and fixed conical structure the dem parameters used in this test is tabulated in table 4 7 d h 1 w 1 2 3 the two loading pins move upward with the constant velocity of 0 01 m s for the quasi static loading condition and force on two loading pins is measured a parametric numerical test is conducted and bending failure of ice beam is examined by gradually increasing the maximum bonding strength from 0 70 mpa to 0 85 mpa for better comparisons the averaged force applied on two loading pins are converted to mid span stress based on the elastic beam theory as follows 8 σ f l e x u r a l 3 f l l i 2 b h 2 fig 6 a shows the time flexural strength curve in that flexural strength linearly increases and then drops down to zero after the failure because of the shaking beam motion after the sudden breaking the residual force on loading pins is continuously observed fig 6 b indicates the deflection flexural strength curve from the slope m representing the linear relation between deflection and flexural strength one can calculate the young s modulus with following equation 9 e σ 3 l 2 4 c 2 12 h m as a result the maximum bonding strength of 0 80 mpa provides the best fit with the physical flexural strength of 1 135 mpa and the young modulus of 0 345 gpa is also well matched with the physical young s modulus of 0 342 gpa with these results the dem parameters are determined to match with the physical ice properties of experiment and then they are used in the rest of the numerical simulations 4 results and discussions based on the numerical settings in the previous sections the interaction of kulluk shaped floating platform subjected to the level ice impact is modeled using the coupled computer programs the hydrodynamic effects on the level ice in the dem simulation are considered by adding buoyancy and viscous forces in accordance with sun and shen 2012 fig 7 depicts the schematic view of the entire system with level ice the initial size of level ice is 400 m x 400 m x 1 25 m in length width and thickness respectively the level ice balanced with the buoyancy and gravity forces is around the water level according to the previous study by ji et al 2015 and pradana and qian 2020 the maximum ice load converges as long as the ice width is greater than 5 times the structure s diameter following their observation we determine the width of level ice to be 400 m which is about 6 times greater than kulluk s diameter at waterline the dem parameters are the same as those of the experiment as in table 4 according to previous studies di et al 2017 pradana and qian 2020 jang and kim 2021 the modeling with 3 layers of discrete elements shows a good agreement with the experimental data in the case of the interaction between fixed conical structure and level ice therefore we kept the same number of layers the dynamic interaction of the floating platform with the level ice is investigated with varying ice drift velocity of 0 13 0 27 0 67 and 1 34 m s the time step used in both simulators charm3d and dem is 0 0001 s complying with rayleigh time step criteria the total of 2 55 million particles are simulated one simulation requires approximately 2 days with 500 cores of 2 8 ghz intel ivy bridge ep due to the lack of space and need of huge additional computational resources the effects of other parameters such as ice thickness and ice strength will be discussed in the future study 4 1 visual observation fig 8 depicts the snapshots of the dynamic interaction between level ice and the structure with drifting velocity of 1 34 m s at the time instant of 100 s as the level ice approaches the structure the intact ice is continuously broken by bending and further breaks into multiple wedge shaped ice floes by hitting the structure from the visual animation of the simulation results the well known ice breaking procedure is observed including breaking rotating and sliding phases due to the relatively high ice drifting speed of 1 34 m s the broken pieces are accumulated in front of the structure with approximately 4 6 times the ice thickness they are subsequently cleared away while passing around the sides of the structure after that the broken ices move upward by buoyancy forces but they are coved by unbroken intact ice when the drifting velocity is low the length of broken pieces varies depending on the occurrence of secondary breaking mode in general the broken ice length by the first collision with the structure ranges about 5 9 times ice thickness which is close to that reported in the iso 19906 standard 2010 in dem simulations when the inter particle stress exceeds the critical bonding strength in either normal or tangential direction particles lose the bonding relations considering this formulation the crack patterns of level ice are investigated by drawing the bonding relation fig 9 shows the level ice crack patterns for the drift velocity of 0 27 m s with increasing time at the initial contact the radial crack at the center line occurs first and the circumferential crack follows which is similar to the case of small diameter cone shaped structure observed in xu et al 2015 then the wedge shaped broken pieces are formed and move along downstream however after the first crack the following cracks occur non simultaneously over the sloped surfaces and no more radial cracks at the centerline is observed which can also be found for the structure with a small diameter jang and kim 2021 because of the consecutive collisions among ice pieces and structure the final length of broken ice is smaller than that formed by the initial contact 4 2 structural motions and ice forces in time domain the time dependent ice forces and the corresponding structural displacements are investigated to identify the key features of interaction between the structure and level ice with constant ice drift velocity without waves the problem setting apparently looks like steady problem but dynamic ice loadings happen due to various patterns of ice breaking in time and time varying features of ice fragments around the hull fig 10 shows the surge heave ice forces and the corresponding surge motions with varying ice velocity at the low ice drift velocity of 0 13 m s the structure is gradually pushed by the momentum of moving ice and the corresponding ice force also increases accordingly when the intact ice breaks the peak ice force is observed and then it rapidly falls down around 250 s the detachment between the intact ice and the structure occurs when the structure moves faster than the ice which is consistent with the papers by aksnes 2010 and jang et al 2016 for this reason the maximum ice force in the x direction at the low drift speed is smaller than other cases the vertical force is strongly related to the geometrical consideration including the slope angle of the structure and the direction of the ice impact according to the iso 19906 2010 the vertical ice force acting on the fixed structure is calculated by scaling the horizontal force based on the structure s slope angle in the moored floating structure case due to the change in pitch motion the orientation of broken ice pieces and dynamic interaction with broken pieces at the first bending dominant initial stage up to 340 s it is shown that the vertical ice force signal deviates from that of horizontal ice force even showing the negative forces at certain time instant however after 340 s the vertical force shows the similar trend with the horizontal force which can be attributed to the combined ice forces with accumulated rubble ices after 200 s the surge displacement of the structure clearly shows the strong correlation with x dir ice force having the similar trends in time series which is the frequency lock in mode in the previous studies määttänen 1998 nord et al 2018 they reported that the offshore structure exposed by drifting ice experienced the ice induced motions at forcing frequency with large amplitude it happens at low drift velocities see fig 12 when it happens it can lead to significant fatigue damages on structures therefore identifying the hull dynamics and assessing the corresponding ice forces are very important for the design of arctic platforms even at low ice drifting speeds as the drifting velocity increases we do not observe the lock in phenomenon instead the surge motion frequencies become quite different from ice excitation frequencies the amplitudes of surge motion decrease and the ice force signals fluctuate faster at higher frequencies with the random and non periodic pattern in the case of drifting velocity at 1 34 m s the surge and heave ice forces show strong correlation with similar time series due to the accumulation of ice rubbles and the relatively high drift velocity the positive ice force is continuously applied to the structure in both x and z directions the structural motion in surge converges to an equilibrium position of 2 8 m with small fluctuations around it as ice drift speed increases from 0 13 m s to 1 34 m s the mean surge is increased but the dynamic surge is decreased 4 3 structural motion and ice force spectra next the psd power spectral density of ice force and surge heave motion corresponding to the above time series are given fig 11 shows the psd plots with varying ice drift velocities due to relatively smaller heave motions compared to the surge motions the heave motion spectra are scaled up by 1000 and 100 for better visualization at the low drift velocity of 0 13 and 0 27 m s the ice force induced frequency lock in modes are clearly observed i e the first two peaks of the surge motion and ice force in the x direction occur at the same frequency of 0 075 and 0 104 rad s respectively the vertical force and motion are also concentrated in the same frequency range showing their similar correlation at the intermediate drift velocity of 0 67 m s we start to see more peaks in both displacements and ice forces in higher frequency range at the highest speed of 1 34 m s more pronounced peaks in higher frequency range can be observed this is due to the fact that the ice breaking and ice rubble movements become faster at higher drift velocity the psd peaks are distributed over a wide range of frequencies which implies more random patterns as discussed before the locations of peak frequencies of x dir ice forces obtained from the numerical simulations are compared with those from the experiment by nixon and ettema 1988 in the figure the peaks of the numerical surge motions are also given for heuristic discussion the dominant peaks of surge motion are slightly increasing but remain close to the surge natural frequency of 0 18 rad s as shown in fig 12 however the peaks of x dir ice forces increase much faster toward higher frequencies as also observed in the experiment at low ice drift velocities 0 13 and 0 27 m s the lock in of ice induced force frequency close to surge natural frequency can be observed both in simulation and experiment at much higher drift velocities the differences between the major peaks of motion and ice force frequencies continue to increase we see a noticeable difference at 0 67 m s case which may be attributed to the uncertainty associated with the transition from the lock in mode to non lock in mode in the current simulation the ice properties such as flexural strength thickness young s modulus etc are assumed to be homogeneous and do not change over time which is not true in the experiment these properties determine the breaking length affecting the forcing frequency also the ice breaking and fragmentation processes are highly random and non repeatable so only qualitative comparisons are possible despite such uncertainties in the experiment and several assumptions and simplifications made in the numerical simulation the essential physics of level ice interaction with the given arctic floating platform with varying drift velocities seem to be captured 4 4 statistics of structural motions and ice forces the simulated maximum and mean values of ice forces are compared with the experimental data by nixon and ettema 1988 also two theoretical calculations based on the simplified methods proposed by ralston 1980 and croasdale et al 1994 are given as a reference the two analytical methods are recommended by iso 19906 2010 for fixed offshore structures ralston s method is based on the plastic plate theory while croasdale s method are based on the elastic beam theory with 3d effects replacing ice weight in air by ice buoyancy in water the ice impact on the downward breaking slopes can be calculated the croasdale s method considers five contributions to the horizontal ice force as follows 10 f h h b h p h r h l h t where fh is the horizontal ice force hb is the breaking force hp is the force required to push the sheet ice through the ice rubble hr is the load to push the ice blocks up the slope though the ice rubble hl is the force required to lift the ice rubble on top of the advancing ice sheet and ht is the force to turn the ice block at the top of the slope the variables used in eq 10 such as density rubble accumulation thickness ride up height and so on are obtained from ice properties and the visual observation from numerical simulations the detailed equations for each term can be found in iso 19906 2010 a 8 2 4 4 2 and a 8 2 4 4 3 the above two equations are for fixed structures and did not consider the effect of level ice drift velocity in fig 13 the mean values and standard deviations of x dir ice forces measured from the nixon s experiment 1988 are given and they are compared with those from the present numerical simulations the data for maximum forces are not directly given in nixon and ettema 1988 but they recommended that the maximum force can be predicted by mean force plus twice the standard deviation with 95 confidence level so the maximum forces by using that formula from both nixon s experiment and present simulation are also compared finally the averages of the three largest peaks of ice forces in the simulated time histories are also plotted as a reference when compared to the experimental data the simulated mean values are in good agreement while the maximum values show some differences in the simulation both mean and maximum values modestly increase with increasing ice drift velocity however in the experiment the mean and maximum values first decrease from 0 13 m s to 0 27 m s then continue to increase slightly from that point on the experimental and simulated maximum values agree well for 0 13 m s for larger ice velocities simulated values are larger than experimental values as pointed out earlier despite many uncertainties associated with the ice properties in the model ice and assumptions made in the numerical simulation as well as highly random and non repeatable ice breaking and fragmentation processes this kind of qualitative agreements between the experimental and simulated results look reasonable and essential physics appear to be captured the averages of the three largest peaks in the simulations become consistently larger than those from croasdale s maximal value formula which implies that the formula does not warrant conservatism the corresponding statistical data are summarized in table 5 in the same figure based on the analytical methods of ralston 1980 and croasdale et al 1994 the ice forces of 10 3 mn and 7 4 mn are computed respectively for the same but fixed platform the present numerical simulations are for compliant platform so the maximum forces are expected to be smaller than those for fixed platform as is shown in the figure according to huang 2010 when the ice breaks against the wide conical structure similar to this particular case the ice failure occurs non simultaneously which will reduce the maximum force the present numerical results seem consistent with his argument in fig 14 the corresponding bar graphs of vertical ice forces are given only simulated results are plotted since no experimental data is available the general trends of the statistical values with increasing drift velocity are similar to those of fig 13 the mean and maximum values increase with ice drift velocity while their standard deviations remain about the same the vertical force magnitudes are in general smaller about 2 3 than horizontal force magnitudes the corresponding statistical values are summarized in table 5 5 conclusions a series of numerical simulations were conducted for an arctic semi submersible subjected to drifting level ice by using the newly developed computer simulation program for the fully coupled ice floater mooring dynamics the external coupling between floater mooring dynamics in house program charm3d and ice mechanics dem open source program liggghts has been achieved by using the named pipe method and the necessary data are shared from to each other to mimic the realistic fracture of level ice the parallel bonding method was employed with an assembly of multiple spherical particles for the computational parameter representing the critical bonding strength the numerical four point beam test was conducted with the given ice properties used in physical experiments the numerical simulations were performed in the time domain with varying ice velocities and the results were compared with the experimental results of nixon and ettema 1988 in general the numerical simulations reasonably estimated the mean and maximum ice loads in the reasonable range of ice drift velocities in addition the computer simulations successfully recovered the ice force lock in phenomenon near surge natural frequency which has been observed in physical tests several important conclusions can be summarized as follows to setup the numerical tests equivalent to the physical experiment the numerical system identification was systematically done through free decay tests in time domain as a result the system stiffness natural frequencies and damping ratios were reasonably modeled the level ice modeling in the dem was performed by adopting the ice material properties directly from the experimental data and the artificial parameter representing the critical bonding strength was determined by the four point numerical bending test from the visual observation level ice fails in bending with multiple consecutive breaking the broken pieces are accumulated in front of the structure with 4 6 times the ice thickness at initial break the broken ice length is about 5 9 times the ice thickness it reveals that the hull shape significantly affects the accumulation of rubble ices the crack pattern is investigated and cracks occur non simultaneously over the wide conical structure the interactions between level ice and a floating structure show different modes with varying ice drift velocity at low ice speed the resonance type large amplitude oscillating motion of the floater is observed furthermore the ice force frequency is locked in motion s frequency in the range of ice velocity 0 13 0 27 m s showing the identical peaks in psd at higher ice speeds the ice loads contain higher frequency peaks and become more random and non periodic which results in smaller platform motion when the thickness of rubble ice is 3 5 times the ice thickness the maximum ice loads by ralston s and croasdale s theoretical methods developed for fixed structures are independently calculated since the floating platform is compliant the maximum ice forces by the present numerical simulations are smaller than those by the simplified formulas the mean and maximum values from the present simulations are compared reasonably well against nixon s experimental results considering all kinds of uncertainties related to model ice properties and randomness and non repeatability of breaking and fragmentation credit authorship contribution

forces moments run up and run down were conducted on a vertical wall vw and on a vertical wall fixed with an immersed horizontal plate vwhp for a wide range of regular and random waves it was found that wave reflection can be reduced by 25 35 using a vwhp with plate length equal to water depth with a submergence of 28 6 of the water depth and that dissipation can be increased by 25 35 the normalized significant inline wave force on the vwhp can be reduced from 0 8 to 0 1 for 0 1 d l p 0 5 the global inline wave force on the vwhp can be reduced by 50 for d l p 0 3 when compared to vw which is beneficial in the design of horizontal sliding the vertical wave forces on the vwhp were significantly higher and increased significantly for lower values of d l p especially for d l p 0 1 the wave induced moment is 10 20 less for the vwhp compared to that for the vw which is also useful for the design against overturning especially if the results are used for the design of caissons with d l 1 where d is the width of the caisson keywords vertical wall immersed horizontal plate wave reflection energy dissipation regular waves random waves 1 introduction and literature review vertical wall type structures are widely used in ocean engineering applications worldwide especially in japan takahashi 2002 and italy franco 1994 some of the important applications of vertical faced marine structures are as follows a vertical seawalls for coastal erosion protection b berthing structures to facilitate loading and unloading of cargo in ports and harbors c caissons for the open sea storage of bulk materials in the latter case the width of the caisson b must be greater than the most predominant wavelength l acting on it i e b l 1 0 so that wave reflection dominates from the caisson although applications of this type of marine structures are very wide they have their own merits and demerits sadeghi et al 2017 and suffer from a few important engineering problems oumeraci et al 2001 these structures reflect the waves significantly creating standing waves that cause navigation hazards reflecting waves with a significant increase in water particle kinematics create substantial scour at the toe of the vertically faced structure sumer and fredsoe 1997 requiring expensive scour protection systems the reflecting wave field is also responsible for the increase in water depth near the vicinity of the structure which attracts higher waves to act on the vws silvester 1972 and caissons thereby increasing the cost of structural design and construction to ensure stability against sliding and overturning the increase in wave energy near the vw also increases the vulnerability of the seabed liquefaction the literature also reveals that in many field applications the existing beaches have vanished after the construction of vertical structures owing to the increase in wave kinematics caused by wave reflection in addition the global wave forces and moments on a vertical faced marine structure are high because of the contribution of the reflecting waves all these drawbacks of vertical faced marine structures are important concerns for coastal engineers many engineering techniques are used to reduce the wave height and wave energy in the immediate vicinity of these structures or direct wave action on the structure these techniques include a installation of offshore breakwaters either submerged or emerged in front of the vertical faced structures muni reddy and neelamani 2005 koraim et al 2014 chioukh et al 2019 b introducing porosity on the vertical face of the structure mackay and johanning 2020 c installing a sloped rubble mound over the structure as a horizontal composite breakwater d installing vertical porous walls around the reflecting large dimension caissons neelamani et al 2000 2002 vijayalakshmi et al 2007 e introducing a series of vertical porous walls neelamani et al 2017 f installing a vertically slotted barrier in front of a vertical faced structure zhu and chwang 2001 poguluri and cho 2020a g installing a submerged and curved structure in front of a vw tian et al 2020 all these methods are useful however in terms of cost some of these solutions may be expensive because a significant volume of construction materials is needed to reduce the wave action on the vws especially if rubble is used for wave damping for example for a typical marine location with a water depth of 6 m in front of the vertical faced structure to reduce the wave height acting on the vertical structure over a range of gravity wave periods by 50 a rubble volume of 70 100 m 3 m of run is required to build a trapezoidal offshore rubble mound breakwater with its crest level located at still water level koley et al 2020 this amount of rubble volume costs approximately 10 000 15 000 usd m of run especially for countries importing quality stones from abroad in this situation alternative and more economic engineering solutions need to be sought we were looking for alternative solutions that help to change the wave scattering problems on vertical wall type structures and reduce the wave kinematics which in turn may reduce the forces and moments on such structures it is clear from the literature that submerged horizontal plates in seawater act as wave barriers and their hydrodynamic performance is a strong function of incident wave height and period neelamani and reddy 1992 a study found that the horizontal plate s depth of submergence has the most significant influence on the overall performance of the structure fang et al 2017 it was also found that placing a horizontal plate at a distance in front of a vertical porous wall significantly enhances the hydrodynamic performance of the structure hu et al 2002 hu and wang 2005 zhao et al 2021 other numerical modeling studies also reported that a submerged porous horizontal plate attached to a vw wu et al 1998 yip et al 2000 liu et al 2007 mohapatra et al 2019 helped to significantly change the wave scattering and reduce wave reflection a recent study by poguluri and cho 2020b revealed that adding a horizontal plate on a vw increases the wave energy dissipation due to wave breaking and the formation of vortices near the plate however there is no literature on wave forces and moments on a vertically faced marine structure with an attached submerged horizontal plate especially based on actual measurements this motivated us to conduct a detailed preliminary investigation based on measurements of wave forces and moments in both regular and random waves on a scale model in a wave flume from a practical point of view adding a submerged plate may not be more expensive than the construction of offshore wave barriers or building single and multiple vertical porous barriers this is an additional motivation for the present investigation it is necessary to critically assess the hydrodynamic performance of a vwhp attached to it which is missing from the literature the hydrodynamic performance includes wave reflection wave energy dissipation wave run up wave run down and global wave forces and moments on the structure a comparison must then be made with that of a conventional vertical seawall to reveal its merits and demerits in the real field condition the vertical caissons are normally placed on the prepared seabed using rubble a similar condition is created for the present wave flume study in the following section the aims and objectives methodology results and discussions conclusions and recommendations for future studies are provided the merits and demerits of attaching a submerged horizontal plate on the vw are provided from a hydrodynamic point of view the results of both regular and random waves are provided so that the regular wave results can be used by researchers working in the area of numerical modeling to verify the numerical model results and the random wave results can be used for the design of such structures for real field conditions 2 aim and objectives the main aim of the present investigation is to perform a thorough experimental study on wave transmission reflection dissipation inline and vertical wave forces inline wave induced moments run up and run down at a vertically faced wall resting on a porous bed and compare all these hydrodynamic performances with the same vertically faced wall attached to a horizontal plate at a particular elevation for a wide range of regular and random wave fields the objective is to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the hydrodynamic performance owing to the addition of the horizontal plate 3 methodology the present physical model study was carried out for generic conditions and not for specific field conditions the model scale results are applicable for fields ranging from 1 5 to 1 20 the wave periods and wave heights were selected such that the results could be used for field conditions for relative water depth d l in the range of 0 05 0 5 and relative wave height h i d up to 0 29 the proposed research investigation was performed according to the following procedure 3 1 design fabrication of physical models and instrumentation this procedure involved purchasing raw materials to fabricate two main models a typical vw and a vw with an attached submerged horizontal plate the attached submerged horizontal plate is 0 7 m long and is attached to the vw at a distance of 0 2 m down the still water level the glass wave flume is 1 2 m deep 0 6 m wide and 54 5 m long it is fixed with a piston wave maker with active wave absorption at one end and a parabolic type passive wave absorber at the other end it was divided into two sections each of 0 3 m width two identical structures were placed inside each section one structure was used for data measurements and the other structure was used as a dummy model fig 1 shows a schematic sketch of the experimental setup and table 1 presents a list of materials used to fabricate the two models inside one section of the wave glass flume the data measurement section two types of instruments were used for data collection a conductivity type wave probe wp and a water tight six component force and moment sensor six wps located before and after the tested models were used to measure wave time histories e g incident waves reflected waves and transmitted waves first probe 1 wp1 was installed at a distance of 8 40 m from the wave maker and wp2 was located 9 30 m from wp1 wp3 and wp4 were installed at 0 6 and 0 985 m respectively from wp2 whereas wp5 was located 6 m from wp4 in the absence of the model wp1 was used to obtain the undisturbed incident wave height h i probes 2 3 and 4 were used to estimate the reflected wave heights h r these three wps wp2 wp3 and wp4 were used instead of only two wps to avoid singularity problems which could occur when the equation in goda and suzuki 1976 used for calculating the wave reflection coefficient becomes infinity as the denominator approaches zero more details on singularity issues are presented in goda and suzuki 1976 mansard and funke 1980 1987 and zelt and skjelbreia 1992 probe 5 wp5 was placed on the tested model to measure the wave run up and run down of the structure because vertical seawalls are normally constructed on a porous seabed made of stones it was necessary to simulate such conditions in our experimental investigation because the rubble seabed has a porosity in the range of 30 45 the bottom 15 c m is provided with 40 67 porosity this corresponded to an overall porosity of 9 fig 1c shows the details of the porous bottom of the structure the overall porosity p of 9 was calculated as 1 p a p a t 100 where a p is the porous area at the bottom of the structure 0 0183 m 2 and a t is the total immersed area and impervious area 0 21 m 2 owing to this permitted porosity at the bottom wave transmission could occur thus probe 6 wp6 was installed at a distance of 7 0 m behind the model to estimate the transmitted wave heights h t the coastal management program at the kuwait institute for scientific research kisr has a new water tight six component force and moment sensor ati industrial automation usa it was used to measure the total wave forces and moments with capacity as presented in table 2 3 2 experimental investigation and data analysis this study depends on experimental investigations and accurate data collection and analysis the experiments were conducted in a glass wave flume at kisr the geometry of which is described above the water depth was kept constant at 0 7 m throughout all experiments a wide range of regular and random wave heights and periods was considered in the experimental investigation the flume dimensions model configurations instruments input conditions normalized input parameter ranges and data collection details are provided in table 2 a detailed uncertainty analysis is carried out for all measured parameters and provided in appendix a 3 2 1 regular waves regular wave results are essential for the theoretical development and fundamental understanding of the performance of the structure under certain repeating conditions these results will help numerical modelers develop improve and validate their mathematical models for similar structures a time domain analysis was performed to obtain the estimated incident and transmitted wave heights h i and h t respectively although experiments were performed for 60 s we only measured a 30 s window of clearly repeating wave cycles to avoid the influence of the reflected wave from the flume artificial beach the data were acquired at a sampling rate of 40 h z hence h i and h t are the average of the wave heights within the 30 s window data the transmission coefficient k t which was a result of the approximately 9 overall porosity permitted at the bottom of the structure to mimic vertical seawalls constructed on top of a porous seabed was estimated as 2 k t h t h i the wave synthesizer software package supplied by the danish hydraulic institute denmark has a wave reflection analysis tool that is based on the work of goda and suzuki 1976 mansard and funke 1980 1987 and zelt and skjelbreia 1992 enabling the reflected wave height h r to be obtained the reflection coefficient k r was estimated as 3 k r h r h i the energy dissipation coefficient k l was estimated based on the law of conservation of wave energy as follows 4 k l 1 k r 2 k t 2 1 2 the newly investigated design of a vw attached to a submerged horizontal plate is expected to be affected by forces in the direction of wave propagation f x and vertical direction f z and by the moments in the shoreward and seaward directions m y consequently the study focused on these three parameters which were normalized as follows 5 f x f x ρ g a h i 2 6 f z f z ρ g a h i 2 and 7 m y m y ρ g a h i 2 d where ρ is the water density in k g m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration in m s 2 and a is the projected area of the structure submerged portion of the structure in m 2 furthermore to select the crest level of the structure it was important to compare the wave run up with and without attaching a horizontal plate to the vw this was achieved via data collected with wp5 which was placed on the structure see fig 1a these data were normalized as follows 8 r u p h i c l c w p 5 h i where h i c l c w p 5 is the average maximum value of the crest heights collected with wp5 and measured from the crossing line to the wave crest the wave run down was also investigated and the data were normalized as follows 9 r d o w n h i c l t w p 5 h i where h i c l t w p 5 is the average value of the wave trough heights collected with wp5 and measured from the crossing line to the wave trough note that h i in equations 2 9 was collected via wp1 in the absence of the models inside the wave flume therefore for regular wave experimental investigations the normalized outputs were k t k r k l f x f z m y r u p and r d o w n whereas the normalized inputs were relative wave height h i d and relative water depth d l in these two normalized inputs d is the water depth and l is the wavelength corresponding to the wave period t of the 30 s data window 3 2 2 random waves random wave results are required for design and field applications frequency domain analysis was used to obtain h i s and significant transmitted wave heights h t s the significant incident wave height is calculated as follows 10 h i s 4 0 m 0 i where m 0 i is the zeroth moment of the incident wave spectrum and is estimated as 11 m 0 i f m i n f m a x s i f d f where s i f is the spectral density of the incident waves and d f is the frequency bin as described earlier in the regular wave section the significant hydrodynamic coefficients k t s k r s and k l s were calculated as 12 k t s h t s h i s 13 k r s h r s h i s and 14 k l s 1 k r s 2 k t s 2 1 2 moreover the normalized significant force in the direction of wave propagation f x s normalized significant force in the vertical direction f z s and normalized significant moments in the shoreward and seaward directions m y s were estimated as 15 f x s f x s ρ g a h i s 2 16 f z s f z s ρ g a h i s 2 and 17 m y s m y s ρ g a h i s 2 d the normalized significant wave run up r u p s and run down r d o w n s were obtained as follows 18 r u p s h i s c l c w p 5 h i s and 19 r d o w n s h i s c l t w p 5 h i s where h i s c l c w p 5 and h i s c l t w p 5 are the average values of the crest and trough heights respectively obtained using data collected from wp5 h i s used in equations 10 19 was measured by wp1 in the absence of the model structure therefore for the random wave experimental investigation the normalized outputs were k t s k r s k l s f x s f z s m y s r u p s and r d o w n s whereas the normalized inputs were relative wave height h i s d and relative water depth d l p in the latter equation l p represents the wavelength corresponding to the peak wave period t p in the following section the normalized outputs are presented with respect to the normalized input conditions to understand the performance of a vw attached to a submerged horizontal plate in comparison to that of a conventional vw at the end of this study the advantages and disadvantages of attaching a submerged horizontal plate to a vw were revealed 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental studies with regular waves 4 1 1 time series of wave forces and moments adding a horizontal plate on a vertical caisson or vw is expected to significantly change the hydrodynamic flow field the local water depth on the horizontal plate was much smaller than the water depth away from the structure the local water depth on the horizontal plate was 20 c m when compared to that at 70 c m offshore hence when the wave acts on the plate it is immediately expected to shoal a nonbreaking far field wave tends to break once it feels the reduced water depth on the plate hence it is important to compare the measured time series of the incident wave wave forces and moments acting on the vw and vwhp a typical time series for h i 15 c m and t 2 014 s is shown in fig 2 this is a typical time series with a relatively high wave height and the wave is almost nearly plunging on the structure the data collection speed was also decided based on observation of the time series records and 40 h z was selected to ensure that the quasi impact was clearly recorded and a very high volume of data was not collected at the data collection speed of 100 h z for example it is clear that forces and moments on vw are completely nonbreaking whereas on vwhp the kinks in the time series indicate quasi breaking the seaward horizontal force f x on the vw was higher than that of the vwhp this is due to the smaller rundown on vwhp compared to vw the vertical force f z on the vw was very small compared to that of vwhp in particular the downward force on the vwhp is very significant because of reverse plunging and its downward momentum on the horizontal plate the horizontal wave force and moment were in phase and a noticeable time lag was found between the vertical and horizontal forces both shoreward and seaward wave induced moments on vwhp were higher than those on vw owing to quasi wave breaking 4 1 2 wave transmission reflection and dissipations the effects of relative water depth d l for different relative heights h i d for both a vw and a vwhp are shown in fig 3 because the experiments were conducted for a constant water depth for a wide range of wave periods and wave heights the effect of d l represents the effect of the wave period and the effect of h i d represents the effect of wave height because the vw lies on a porous bedding it allows some wave energy penetration and is converted into a transmitted wave the transmission coefficient for the long wave height d l 0 1 and short wave height h i d 0 071 are approximately 0 2 the transmission for a long wave decreases with an increase in wave height to a level of 0 1 with an increase in d l the transmission gradually decreases to almost zero because of the reduced water particle velocity acceleration and wave pressure near the bed level the wave reflection coefficient on the vw is also a function of d l and h i d when d l 0 35 the reflection becomes a function of h i d mild waves small h i d reflect almost 80 however with an increase in h i d the strong wave wave interaction higher turbulence and breaking induced more energy dissipation and resulted in reduced wave reflection for a vwhp the wave transmission is high for low energy wave action because the water particles are trapped underneath the horizontal plate and escape through the porous seabed however k r s decreased significantly for higher energy waves the presence of a horizontal plate significantly modified the wave transformation of the structure the transformation of waves on the plate for a short period wave h i 20 c m and t 1 002 s and long period waves h i 20 c m and t 2 837 s are shown in fig 4 the presence of a plate of length equal to the water depth reduces the local water depth in front of the wall which creates quasi wave breaking conditions on the vw as well as reverse wave plunging for long period waves these phenomena are responsible for better wave energy dissipation compared to that of the vw without a horizontal plate this resulted in reduced wave reflection for a wide range of d l values therefore if wave reflection reduction is required in front of the vw type of structures adding a horizontal plate in principle helps to achieve this therefore the addition of a horizontal plate helps to reduce the wave transmission for long waves by reducing the wave kinematics at the bedding layer level it also helps to reduce wave reflection by 30 40 and helps to increase wave energy dissipation by 20 30 4 1 3 wave forces and moments wave forces and moments are required for the design of this type of structure to mitigate sliding and overturning the normalized maximum inline and vertical forces the inline moment of the vw and the vw with the horizontal plate structure are shown in fig 5 for inline force and moment f x and m y the positive value is the shoreward force moment and the negative value is the seaward force moment similarly the positive value of the vertical force f z is the upward force and the negative value is the downward force it is important to note that the shoreward force is much higher than the seaward force especially for long waves on the vw for long period waves d l 0 05 the maximum value of the normalized shoreward force is 1 75 whereas the maximum value of the normalized seaward force is only 0 9 which indicates that horizontal sliding is more probable toward the shore than toward the sea the shoreward and seaward force coefficients decreased with an increase in d l and the value decreased to 0 4 for d l 0 5 this clearly indicates that vertical faced structures need to be designed for predominant long period waves at the location of the structure the increase in h i d from 0 071 to 0 29 has some effects 5 10 the magnitude of the vertical wave force coefficient on the vw is 0 5 for the entire range of d l owing to the action of water particle kinematics on the bottom plate over which the vw is fixed the maximum value of the moment coefficient is approximately 0 65 toward the shore and for long waves d l 0 05 the horizontal wave force coefficient on the vwhp was found to be a function of both the wave period and wave height the value of the inline force coefficient decreases with an increase in d l as observed for the vw but the force coefficient was found to increase with an increase in h i d this is especially true for the shoreward force the reason for this is the significant transformation of waves and the breaking effect when h i d is increased from 0 071 to 0 29 this effect was not felt by the seaward wave force this information is critical for designing this type of structure the vertical wave force on the vw with the horizontal plate was much higher than that on the vw alone the force coefficient peaks at d l 0 15 the wave induced moment also increased compared to that of the vw overall the introduction of a horizontal plate increases the vertical force and wave induced moments on the structure increasing the value of h i d has a significant effect on the shoreward wave force it is necessary to conduct further research on how to reduce the wave force and moment by introducing porosity on the horizontal plate and changing the plate elevation and length 4 1 4 wave run up and run down the investigation of wave run up is essential for fixing the crest level of this type of structure fig 6 shows the run up and run down for a wide range of wave heights and wave periods according to goda 1974 the run up level is a factor of 1 5 which is higher than the design wave height in the present study only for d l 0 1 did the run up level reach 1 5 the present experiment is completely a 2d model similar experiments in 3d model carried out by molin et al 2010 and zhao et al 2019 has measured highest run up close to 5 times the incident wave amplitude which was due to tertiary interactions such interactions were not found to occur in 2d model studies for all other wave periods the run up level was between 0 8 and 1 2 the change in the incident wave height also has some effect on both the run up and run down on the vw the run down exhibited a decreasing trend when d l was increased for a vwhp changing the wave period and wave height had a noticeable effect the wave run up decreased as d l increased there is no definite trend in the change in wave run up when h i d is increased from 0 071 to 0 29 however the run up coefficient is minimum at a higher h i d of 0 29 owing to significant wave induced turbulence and dissipation near the structure adding a horizontal plate helps to reduce the run down coefficient significantly by 20 30 especially for higher d l values 4 1 5 comparison of a wave conditions for a vw and a vwhp a close comparison of the hydrodynamic performances of the vw and vwhp is useful for designers of such structures because the design is performed for high wave height conditions a comparison was made for the highest value of h i d 0 29 used in the present study fig 7 shows a comparison of wave transmission reflection dissipation forces and moments the addition of a horizontal plate has an insignificant effect on wave transmission but decreases wave reflection and increases wave dissipation significantly which is very positive for the design fixing the horizontal plate significantly reduced the seaward wave force which was due to the reduced run down effect on the vw with the horizontal plate the vertical force both upward and downward increased significantly owing to the presence of the horizontal plate reducing the vertical upward force requires additional attention and study the increase in vertical downward force however is useful as it will help to add to the net downward force which in turn is useful for stability against horizontal sliding moreover it was also noted that adding a horizontal plate slightly increased the positive wave induced moment fig 8 compares the run up and run down at the vw and the vwhp structure for h i d 0 29 the average value of run down decreased from 0 75 to 0 45 which was responsible for reducing the seaward wave force significantly as shown in fig 7 note that the run up value is less for the vwhp when compared to that for the vw when d l 0 3 which is useful for selecting the optimal elevation of the crest level of the structure 4 2 results of experimental studies with random waves the results of random wave studies can be used to design the present structures and field applications 4 2 1 wave transmission reflection and dissipation fig 9 shows the effect of the wave period d l p and wave height h i s d on the transmission reflection and dissipation at the vw and the vwhp for random waves the trends of the variation in wave transmission were similar to the regular wave study results however the effect of increasing h i s d from 0 071 to 0 21 is insignificant unlike the significant changes observed in regular wave studies it was found that wave reflection can be reduced by 25 35 by introducing a horizontal plate as the one used in the present study and the dissipation can be increased by 25 35 4 2 2 wave forces and moments because the frequency domain analysis was performed on the wave forces and moment time series the results were presented using the significant forces and moments fig 10 shows that the inline force decreased with an increase in d l p from 1 0 to 0 5 for the vw for a vwhp it decreased from 0 8 to 0 1 which is highly beneficial for the design of this type of structure to mitigate horizontal sliding as discussed in the previous case the change in h i s d did not alter the value of the normalized inline forces as discussed for regular wave interactions the vertical forces on the vwhp were significantly higher than those on the vw it is interesting to note that the wave induced moment is 10 20 less for the vwhp which is useful for the design to mitigate overturning if the results are used for the design of caissons with d l 1 4 2 3 wave run up and run down fig 11 presents the normalized average maximum run up and run down owing to random waves because the y axis is the average of all the run up values its value is much smaller than that of regular wave results the highest value is 0 8 for the vwhp moreover for a vwhp the run up value decreased with an increase in d l p and was not significant for the vw case as discussed for regular waves the rundown is smaller for the vwhp compared to the vw case 4 2 4 comparison of wave conditions for a vw and a vwhp fig 12 compares the hydrodynamic parameters forces and moments for h i s d 0 21 which is the highest wave energy condition simulated in the wave flume for all wave periods the comparison is similar to that for regular waves although the values are noticeably different the increased wave dissipation helped to reduce wave reflection the inline wave force can be reduced by 50 for higher d l p values such as d l p 0 3 the vertical wave force on the vw with the horizontal plate increased significantly for lower values of d l p especially for d l p 0 1 wave induced moments can be reduced by 10 25 for a vwhp depending on the d l p value overall the merits and demerits of adding a vertical plate to the vw are clearly revealed fig 13 shows that the vwhp helps to reduce the wave run down but has little effect on wave run up 5 conclusions detailed experimental investigations on wave transmission reflection dissipation forces moments run up and rundown on a vw resting on a porous seabed as well as on a vwhp structure were conducted for regular and random waves with a wide range of wave heights and periods the important conclusions of this experimental investigation are as follows 5 1 regular waves in general adding a horizontal plate to the vertical wall helps to reduce wave transmission especially for long waves it helps to reduce wave reflection by 30 40 and increases wave energy dissipation by 20 30 the introduction of a horizontal plate on the vertical wall increases the vertical wave force and wave induced moments on the structure increasing the value of the relative wave height h i d has a significant effect on the shoreward wave force fixing the horizontal plate helps to significantly reduce the seaward wave force adding a horizontal plate helps to reduce the run down coefficient significantly by 20 30 especially for d l 0 2 5 2 random waves wave reflection can be reduced by 25 35 by introducing a horizontal plate and the dissipation can be increased by 25 35 on a vw the normalized significant inline wave force can be reduced from 1 0 to 0 5 with an increase in d l p from 0 1 to 0 5 for a vwhp the value can be reduced from 0 8 to 0 1 the inline wave force can be reduced by 50 for higher d l p values such as d l p 0 3 which is highly beneficial for the design of this type of structure to mitigate horizontal sliding the change in h i s d from 0 071 to 0 21 does not alter the value of the normalized inline forces the vertical forces on the vwhp were significantly higher than those in the vw case the vertical wave force on the vwhp increased significantly for lower values of d l p especially for d l p 0 1 the wave induced moment is 10 20 less for a vwhp which is useful for the design to mitigate overturning especially if the results are used for the design of caissons with d l 1 while applying the study results for field applications it is recommended to provide suitable warning signs and marker buoys to the users about the presence of a submerged horizontal plate on the vertical face of the wall this would help reduce any vessel collisions on the immersed plate in an offshore caisson the vessel should be moored on the lee side and horizontal plate where there is no attachment of the horizontal plate 6 future studies required this detailed experimental investigation of regular and random wave fields helped to reveal the overall merits and demerits of adding a horizontal plate to a vw further research is required to overcome the drawbacks of this new design these can be summarized as follows for regular waves the vertical force upward and downward increased significantly because of the presence of the horizontal plate this observation necessitates further attention and studies on how to reduce such increased vertical forces especially in the upward direction it is important to note that the increase in downward force is not necessarily disadvantageous as it could add stability to the structure against horizontal sliding moreover the introduction of a horizontal plate increased the wave induced moments on the structure and by increasing the value of h i d the shoreward wave force also increased for random waves and as noted with regular waves the vertical forces on the vwhp were significantly higher than those on the vw however the wave induced moment was 10 20 less for the vwhp which is useful for the design to mitigate overturning if the results are used for the design of caissons with d l 1 additional research is needed to address how to reduce the wave force and moment by introducing the porosity of the horizontal plate changing the plate elevation and changing the length of the plate a thorough comparison of the measured results with suitable mathematical model based results will be useful for a wide range of applications credit authorship contribution statement ahmad alyousif conceptualization

measurement range of voltage for each channel is 10 v to 10 v hence one bit change which is the resolution for each channel corresponds to 0 004883 v 20 212 v the corresponding resolution for the wave probe and six component wave force and moment sensor for the full scale range is provided in table a 1 the range of measured wave heights is 5 20 cm for regular waves and 5 15 cm for random waves the uncertainty for the measurement of wave heights from 5 cm to 20 m is 0 075 0 3 similarly the range of measured f x values is 30 n to 300 n the range of measured f z is 60 n to 300 n and the range of measured m y is 15 n m to 150 n m the corresponding range of measurement uncertainty for these three parameters is provided in table a 1 it should be kept in mind that for the field design of the structure the values corresponding to the higher ranges of incident wave heights wave forces and moments would be used hence the appropriate uncertainty from application point of view corresponds to the lower range of uncertainty it is 1 for the vertical force f z and very much less than 1 for all other parameters table a 1 resolution and measurement uncertainty of each parameter table a 1 s no

forces moments run up and run down were conducted on a vertical wall vw and on a vertical wall fixed with an immersed horizontal plate vwhp for a wide range of regular and random waves it was found that wave reflection can be reduced by 25 35 using a vwhp with plate length equal to water depth with a submergence of 28 6 of the water depth and that dissipation can be increased by 25 35 the normalized significant inline wave force on the vwhp can be reduced from 0 8 to 0 1 for 0 1 d l p 0 5 the global inline wave force on the vwhp can be reduced by 50 for d l p 0 3 when compared to vw which is beneficial in the design of horizontal sliding the vertical wave forces on the vwhp were significantly higher and increased significantly for lower values of d l p especially for d l p 0 1 the wave induced moment is 10 20 less for the vwhp compared to that for the vw which is also useful for the design against overturning especially if the results are used for the design of caissons with d l 1 where d is the width of the caisson keywords vertical wall immersed horizontal plate wave reflection energy dissipation regular waves random waves 1 introduction and literature review vertical wall type structures are widely used in ocean engineering applications worldwide especially in japan takahashi 2002 and italy franco 1994 some of the important applications of vertical faced marine structures are as follows a vertical seawalls for coastal erosion protection b berthing structures to facilitate loading and unloading of cargo in ports and harbors c caissons for the open sea storage of bulk materials in the latter case the width of the caisson b must be greater than the most predominant wavelength l acting on it i e b l 1 0 so that wave reflection dominates from the caisson although applications of this type of marine structures are very wide they have their own merits and demerits sadeghi et al 2017 and suffer from a few important engineering problems oumeraci et al 2001 these structures reflect the waves significantly creating standing waves that cause navigation hazards reflecting waves with a significant increase in water particle kinematics create substantial scour at the toe of the vertically faced structure sumer and fredsoe 1997 requiring expensive scour protection systems the reflecting wave field is also responsible for the increase in water depth near the vicinity of the structure which attracts higher waves to act on the vws silvester 1972 and caissons thereby increasing the cost of structural design and construction to ensure stability against sliding and overturning the increase in wave energy near the vw also increases the vulnerability of the seabed liquefaction the literature also reveals that in many field applications the existing beaches have vanished after the construction of vertical structures owing to the increase in wave kinematics caused by wave reflection in addition the global wave forces and moments on a vertical faced marine structure are high because of the contribution of the reflecting waves all these drawbacks of vertical faced marine structures are important concerns for coastal engineers many engineering techniques are used to reduce the wave height and wave energy in the immediate vicinity of these structures or direct wave action on the structure these techniques include a installation of offshore breakwaters either submerged or emerged in front of the vertical faced structures muni reddy and neelamani 2005 koraim et al 2014 chioukh et al 2019 b introducing porosity on the vertical face of the structure mackay and johanning 2020 c installing a sloped rubble mound over the structure as a horizontal composite breakwater d installing vertical porous walls around the reflecting large dimension caissons neelamani et al 2000 2002 vijayalakshmi et al 2007 e introducing a series of vertical porous walls neelamani et al 2017 f installing a vertically slotted barrier in front of a vertical faced structure zhu and chwang 2001 poguluri and cho 2020a g installing a submerged and curved structure in front of a vw tian et al 2020 all these methods are useful however in terms of cost some of these solutions may be expensive because a significant volume of construction materials is needed to reduce the wave action on the vws especially if rubble is used for wave damping for example for a typical marine location with a water depth of 6 m in front of the vertical faced structure to reduce the wave height acting on the vertical structure over a range of gravity wave periods by 50 a rubble volume of 70 100 m 3 m of run is required to build a trapezoidal offshore rubble mound breakwater with its crest level located at still water level koley et al 2020 this amount of rubble volume costs approximately 10 000 15 000 usd m of run especially for countries importing quality stones from abroad in this situation alternative and more economic engineering solutions need to be sought we were looking for alternative solutions that help to change the wave scattering problems on vertical wall type structures and reduce the wave kinematics which in turn may reduce the forces and moments on such structures it is clear from the literature that submerged horizontal plates in seawater act as wave barriers and their hydrodynamic performance is a strong function of incident wave height and period neelamani and reddy 1992 a study found that the horizontal plate s depth of submergence has the most significant influence on the overall performance of the structure fang et al 2017 it was also found that placing a horizontal plate at a distance in front of a vertical porous wall significantly enhances the hydrodynamic performance of the structure hu et al 2002 hu and wang 2005 zhao et al 2021 other numerical modeling studies also reported that a submerged porous horizontal plate attached to a vw wu et al 1998 yip et al 2000 liu et al 2007 mohapatra et al 2019 helped to significantly change the wave scattering and reduce wave reflection a recent study by poguluri and cho 2020b revealed that adding a horizontal plate on a vw increases the wave energy dissipation due to wave breaking and the formation of vortices near the plate however there is no literature on wave forces and moments on a vertically faced marine structure with an attached submerged horizontal plate especially based on actual measurements this motivated us to conduct a detailed preliminary investigation based on measurements of wave forces and moments in both regular and random waves on a scale model in a wave flume from a practical point of view adding a submerged plate may not be more expensive than the construction of offshore wave barriers or building single and multiple vertical porous barriers this is an additional motivation for the present investigation it is necessary to critically assess the hydrodynamic performance of a vwhp attached to it which is missing from the literature the hydrodynamic performance includes wave reflection wave energy dissipation wave run up wave run down and global wave forces and moments on the structure a comparison must then be made with that of a conventional vertical seawall to reveal its merits and demerits in the real field condition the vertical caissons are normally placed on the prepared seabed using rubble a similar condition is created for the present wave flume study in the following section the aims and objectives methodology results and discussions conclusions and recommendations for future studies are provided the merits and demerits of attaching a submerged horizontal plate on the vw are provided from a hydrodynamic point of view the results of both regular and random waves are provided so that the regular wave results can be used by researchers working in the area of numerical modeling to verify the numerical model results and the random wave results can be used for the design of such structures for real field conditions 2 aim and objectives the main aim of the present investigation is to perform a thorough experimental study on wave transmission reflection dissipation inline and vertical wave forces inline wave induced moments run up and run down at a vertically faced wall resting on a porous bed and compare all these hydrodynamic performances with the same vertically faced wall attached to a horizontal plate at a particular elevation for a wide range of regular and random wave fields the objective is to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the hydrodynamic performance owing to the addition of the horizontal plate 3 methodology the present physical model study was carried out for generic conditions and not for specific field conditions the model scale results are applicable for fields ranging from 1 5 to 1 20 the wave periods and wave heights were selected such that the results could be used for field conditions for relative water depth d l in the range of 0 05 0 5 and relative wave height h i d up to 0 29 the proposed research investigation was performed according to the following procedure 3 1 design fabrication of physical models and instrumentation this procedure involved purchasing raw materials to fabricate two main models a typical vw and a vw with an attached submerged horizontal plate the attached submerged horizontal plate is 0 7 m long and is attached to the vw at a distance of 0 2 m down the still water level the glass wave flume is 1 2 m deep 0 6 m wide and 54 5 m long it is fixed with a piston wave maker with active wave absorption at one end and a parabolic type passive wave absorber at the other end it was divided into two sections each of 0 3 m width two identical structures were placed inside each section one structure was used for data measurements and the other structure was used as a dummy model fig 1 shows a schematic sketch of the experimental setup and table 1 presents a list of materials used to fabricate the two models inside one section of the wave glass flume the data measurement section two types of instruments were used for data collection a conductivity type wave probe wp and a water tight six component force and moment sensor six wps located before and after the tested models were used to measure wave time histories e g incident waves reflected waves and transmitted waves first probe 1 wp1 was installed at a distance of 8 40 m from the wave maker and wp2 was located 9 30 m from wp1 wp3 and wp4 were installed at 0 6 and 0 985 m respectively from wp2 whereas wp5 was located 6 m from wp4 in the absence of the model wp1 was used to obtain the undisturbed incident wave height h i probes 2 3 and 4 were used to estimate the reflected wave heights h r these three wps wp2 wp3 and wp4 were used instead of only two wps to avoid singularity problems which could occur when the equation in goda and suzuki 1976 used for calculating the wave reflection coefficient becomes infinity as the denominator approaches zero more details on singularity issues are presented in goda and suzuki 1976 mansard and funke 1980 1987 and zelt and skjelbreia 1992 probe 5 wp5 was placed on the tested model to measure the wave run up and run down of the structure because vertical seawalls are normally constructed on a porous seabed made of stones it was necessary to simulate such conditions in our experimental investigation because the rubble seabed has a porosity in the range of 30 45 the bottom 15 c m is provided with 40 67 porosity this corresponded to an overall porosity of 9 fig 1c shows the details of the porous bottom of the structure the overall porosity p of 9 was calculated as 1 p a p a t 100 where a p is the porous area at the bottom of the structure 0 0183 m 2 and a t is the total immersed area and impervious area 0 21 m 2 owing to this permitted porosity at the bottom wave transmission could occur thus probe 6 wp6 was installed at a distance of 7 0 m behind the model to estimate the transmitted wave heights h t the coastal management program at the kuwait institute for scientific research kisr has a new water tight six component force and moment sensor ati industrial automation usa it was used to measure the total wave forces and moments with capacity as presented in table 2 3 2 experimental investigation and data analysis this study depends on experimental investigations and accurate data collection and analysis the experiments were conducted in a glass wave flume at kisr the geometry of which is described above the water depth was kept constant at 0 7 m throughout all experiments a wide range of regular and random wave heights and periods was considered in the experimental investigation the flume dimensions model configurations instruments input conditions normalized input parameter ranges and data collection details are provided in table 2 a detailed uncertainty analysis is carried out for all measured parameters and provided in appendix a 3 2 1 regular waves regular wave results are essential for the theoretical development and fundamental understanding of the performance of the structure under certain repeating conditions these results will help numerical modelers develop improve and validate their mathematical models for similar structures a time domain analysis was performed to obtain the estimated incident and transmitted wave heights h i and h t respectively although experiments were performed for 60 s we only measured a 30 s window of clearly repeating wave cycles to avoid the influence of the reflected wave from the flume artificial beach the data were acquired at a sampling rate of 40 h z hence h i and h t are the average of the wave heights within the 30 s window data the transmission coefficient k t which was a result of the approximately 9 overall porosity permitted at the bottom of the structure to mimic vertical seawalls constructed on top of a porous seabed was estimated as 2 k t h t h i the wave synthesizer software package supplied by the danish hydraulic institute denmark has a wave reflection analysis tool that is based on the work of goda and suzuki 1976 mansard and funke 1980 1987 and zelt and skjelbreia 1992 enabling the reflected wave height h r to be obtained the reflection coefficient k r was estimated as 3 k r h r h i the energy dissipation coefficient k l was estimated based on the law of conservation of wave energy as follows 4 k l 1 k r 2 k t 2 1 2 the newly investigated design of a vw attached to a submerged horizontal plate is expected to be affected by forces in the direction of wave propagation f x and vertical direction f z and by the moments in the shoreward and seaward directions m y consequently the study focused on these three parameters which were normalized as follows 5 f x f x ρ g a h i 2 6 f z f z ρ g a h i 2 and 7 m y m y ρ g a h i 2 d where ρ is the water density in k g m 3 g is the gravitational acceleration in m s 2 and a is the projected area of the structure submerged portion of the structure in m 2 furthermore to select the crest level of the structure it was important to compare the wave run up with and without attaching a horizontal plate to the vw this was achieved via data collected with wp5 which was placed on the structure see fig 1a these data were normalized as follows 8 r u p h i c l c w p 5 h i where h i c l c w p 5 is the average maximum value of the crest heights collected with wp5 and measured from the crossing line to the wave crest the wave run down was also investigated and the data were normalized as follows 9 r d o w n h i c l t w p 5 h i where h i c l t w p 5 is the average value of the wave trough heights collected with wp5 and measured from the crossing line to the wave trough note that h i in equations 2 9 was collected via wp1 in the absence of the models inside the wave flume therefore for regular wave experimental investigations the normalized outputs were k t k r k l f x f z m y r u p and r d o w n whereas the normalized inputs were relative wave height h i d and relative water depth d l in these two normalized inputs d is the water depth and l is the wavelength corresponding to the wave period t of the 30 s data window 3 2 2 random waves random wave results are required for design and field applications frequency domain analysis was used to obtain h i s and significant transmitted wave heights h t s the significant incident wave height is calculated as follows 10 h i s 4 0 m 0 i where m 0 i is the zeroth moment of the incident wave spectrum and is estimated as 11 m 0 i f m i n f m a x s i f d f where s i f is the spectral density of the incident waves and d f is the frequency bin as described earlier in the regular wave section the significant hydrodynamic coefficients k t s k r s and k l s were calculated as 12 k t s h t s h i s 13 k r s h r s h i s and 14 k l s 1 k r s 2 k t s 2 1 2 moreover the normalized significant force in the direction of wave propagation f x s normalized significant force in the vertical direction f z s and normalized significant moments in the shoreward and seaward directions m y s were estimated as 15 f x s f x s ρ g a h i s 2 16 f z s f z s ρ g a h i s 2 and 17 m y s m y s ρ g a h i s 2 d the normalized significant wave run up r u p s and run down r d o w n s were obtained as follows 18 r u p s h i s c l c w p 5 h i s and 19 r d o w n s h i s c l t w p 5 h i s where h i s c l c w p 5 and h i s c l t w p 5 are the average values of the crest and trough heights respectively obtained using data collected from wp5 h i s used in equations 10 19 was measured by wp1 in the absence of the model structure therefore for the random wave experimental investigation the normalized outputs were k t s k r s k l s f x s f z s m y s r u p s and r d o w n s whereas the normalized inputs were relative wave height h i s d and relative water depth d l p in the latter equation l p represents the wavelength corresponding to the peak wave period t p in the following section the normalized outputs are presented with respect to the normalized input conditions to understand the performance of a vw attached to a submerged horizontal plate in comparison to that of a conventional vw at the end of this study the advantages and disadvantages of attaching a submerged horizontal plate to a vw were revealed 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental studies with regular waves 4 1 1 time series of wave forces and moments adding a horizontal plate on a vertical caisson or vw is expected to significantly change the hydrodynamic flow field the local water depth on the horizontal plate was much smaller than the water depth away from the structure the local water depth on the horizontal plate was 20 c m when compared to that at 70 c m offshore hence when the wave acts on the plate it is immediately expected to shoal a nonbreaking far field wave tends to break once it feels the reduced water depth on the plate hence it is important to compare the measured time series of the incident wave wave forces and moments acting on the vw and vwhp a typical time series for h i 15 c m and t 2 014 s is shown in fig 2 this is a typical time series with a relatively high wave height and the wave is almost nearly plunging on the structure the data collection speed was also decided based on observation of the time series records and 40 h z was selected to ensure that the quasi impact was clearly recorded and a very high volume of data was not collected at the data collection speed of 100 h z for example it is clear that forces and moments on vw are completely nonbreaking whereas on vwhp the kinks in the time series indicate quasi breaking the seaward horizontal force f x on the vw was higher than that of the vwhp this is due to the smaller rundown on vwhp compared to vw the vertical force f z on the vw was very small compared to that of vwhp in particular the downward force on the vwhp is very significant because of reverse plunging and its downward momentum on the horizontal plate the horizontal wave force and moment were in phase and a noticeable time lag was found between the vertical and horizontal forces both shoreward and seaward wave induced moments on vwhp were higher than those on vw owing to quasi wave breaking 4 1 2 wave transmission reflection and dissipations the effects of relative water depth d l for different relative heights h i d for both a vw and a vwhp are shown in fig 3 because the experiments were conducted for a constant water depth for a wide range of wave periods and wave heights the effect of d l represents the effect of the wave period and the effect of h i d represents the effect of wave height because the vw lies on a porous bedding it allows some wave energy penetration and is converted into a transmitted wave the transmission coefficient for the long wave height d l 0 1 and short wave height h i d 0 071 are approximately 0 2 the transmission for a long wave decreases with an increase in wave height to a level of 0 1 with an increase in d l the transmission gradually decreases to almost zero because of the reduced water particle velocity acceleration and wave pressure near the bed level the wave reflection coefficient on the vw is also a function of d l and h i d when d l 0 35 the reflection becomes a function of h i d mild waves small h i d reflect almost 80 however with an increase in h i d the strong wave wave interaction higher turbulence and breaking induced more energy dissipation and resulted in reduced wave reflection for a vwhp the wave transmission is high for low energy wave action because the water particles are trapped underneath the horizontal plate and escape through the porous seabed however k r s decreased significantly for higher energy waves the presence of a horizontal plate significantly modified the wave transformation of the structure the transformation of waves on the plate for a short period wave h i 20 c m and t 1 002 s and long period waves h i 20 c m and t 2 837 s are shown in fig 4 the presence of a plate of length equal to the water depth reduces the local water depth in front of the wall which creates quasi wave breaking conditions on the vw as well as reverse wave plunging for long period waves these phenomena are responsible for better wave energy dissipation compared to that of the vw without a horizontal plate this resulted in reduced wave reflection for a wide range of d l values therefore if wave reflection reduction is required in front of the vw type of structures adding a horizontal plate in principle helps to achieve this therefore the addition of a horizontal plate helps to reduce the wave transmission for long waves by reducing the wave kinematics at the bedding layer level it also helps to reduce wave reflection by 30 40 and helps to increase wave energy dissipation by 20 30 4 1 3 wave forces and moments wave forces and moments are required for the design of this type of structure to mitigate sliding and overturning the normalized maximum inline and vertical forces the inline moment of the vw and the vw with the horizontal plate structure are shown in fig 5 for inline force and moment f x and m y the positive value is the shoreward force moment and the negative value is the seaward force moment similarly the positive value of the vertical force f z is the upward force and the negative value is the downward force it is important to note that the shoreward force is much higher than the seaward force especially for long waves on the vw for long period waves d l 0 05 the maximum value of the normalized shoreward force is 1 75 whereas the maximum value of the normalized seaward force is only 0 9 which indicates that horizontal sliding is more probable toward the shore than toward the sea the shoreward and seaward force coefficients decreased with an increase in d l and the value decreased to 0 4 for d l 0 5 this clearly indicates that vertical faced structures need to be designed for predominant long period waves at the location of the structure the increase in h i d from 0 071 to 0 29 has some effects 5 10 the magnitude of the vertical wave force coefficient on the vw is 0 5 for the entire range of d l owing to the action of water particle kinematics on the bottom plate over which the vw is fixed the maximum value of the moment coefficient is approximately 0 65 toward the shore and for long waves d l 0 05 the horizontal wave force coefficient on the vwhp was found to be a function of both the wave period and wave height the value of the inline force coefficient decreases with an increase in d l as observed for the vw but the force coefficient was found to increase with an increase in h i d this is especially true for the shoreward force the reason for this is the significant transformation of waves and the breaking effect when h i d is increased from 0 071 to 0 29 this effect was not felt by the seaward wave force this information is critical for designing this type of structure the vertical wave force on the vw with the horizontal plate was much higher than that on the vw alone the force coefficient peaks at d l 0 15 the wave induced moment also increased compared to that of the vw overall the introduction of a horizontal plate increases the vertical force and wave induced moments on the structure increasing the value of h i d has a significant effect on the shoreward wave force it is necessary to conduct further research on how to reduce the wave force and moment by introducing porosity on the horizontal plate and changing the plate elevation and length 4 1 4 wave run up and run down the investigation of wave run up is essential for fixing the crest level of this type of structure fig 6 shows the run up and run down for a wide range of wave heights and wave periods according to goda 1974 the run up level is a factor of 1 5 which is higher than the design wave height in the present study only for d l 0 1 did the run up level reach 1 5 the present experiment is completely a 2d model similar experiments in 3d model carried out by molin et al 2010 and zhao et al 2019 has measured highest run up close to 5 times the incident wave amplitude which was due to tertiary interactions such interactions were not found to occur in 2d model studies for all other wave periods the run up level was between 0 8 and 1 2 the change in the incident wave height also has some effect on both the run up and run down on the vw the run down exhibited a decreasing trend when d l was increased for a vwhp changing the wave period and wave height had a noticeable effect the wave run up decreased as d l increased there is no definite trend in the change in wave run up when h i d is increased from 0 071 to 0 29 however the run up coefficient is minimum at a higher h i d of 0 29 owing to significant wave induced turbulence and dissipation near the structure adding a horizontal plate helps to reduce the run down coefficient significantly by 20 30 especially for higher d l values 4 1 5 comparison of a wave conditions for a vw and a vwhp a close comparison of the hydrodynamic performances of the vw and vwhp is useful for designers of such structures because the design is performed for high wave height conditions a comparison was made for the highest value of h i d 0 29 used in the present study fig 7 shows a comparison of wave transmission reflection dissipation forces and moments the addition of a horizontal plate has an insignificant effect on wave transmission but decreases wave reflection and increases wave dissipation significantly which is very positive for the design fixing the horizontal plate significantly reduced the seaward wave force which was due to the reduced run down effect on the vw with the horizontal plate the vertical force both upward and downward increased significantly owing to the presence of the horizontal plate reducing the vertical upward force requires additional attention and study the increase in vertical downward force however is useful as it will help to add to the net downward force which in turn is useful for stability against horizontal sliding moreover it was also noted that adding a horizontal plate slightly increased the positive wave induced moment fig 8 compares the run up and run down at the vw and the vwhp structure for h i d 0 29 the average value of run down decreased from 0 75 to 0 45 which was responsible for reducing the seaward wave force significantly as shown in fig 7 note that the run up value is less for the vwhp when compared to that for the vw when d l 0 3 which is useful for selecting the optimal elevation of the crest level of the structure 4 2 results of experimental studies with random waves the results of random wave studies can be used to design the present structures and field applications 4 2 1 wave transmission reflection and dissipation fig 9 shows the effect of the wave period d l p and wave height h i s d on the transmission reflection and dissipation at the vw and the vwhp for random waves the trends of the variation in wave transmission were similar to the regular wave study results however the effect of increasing h i s d from 0 071 to 0 21 is insignificant unlike the significant changes observed in regular wave studies it was found that wave reflection can be reduced by 25 35 by introducing a horizontal plate as the one used in the present study and the dissipation can be increased by 25 35 4 2 2 wave forces and moments because the frequency domain analysis was performed on the wave forces and moment time series the results were presented using the significant forces and moments fig 10 shows that the inline force decreased with an increase in d l p from 1 0 to 0 5 for the vw for a vwhp it decreased from 0 8 to 0 1 which is highly beneficial for the design of this type of structure to mitigate horizontal sliding as discussed in the previous case the change in h i s d did not alter the value of the normalized inline forces as discussed for regular wave interactions the vertical forces on the vwhp were significantly higher than those on the vw it is interesting to note that the wave induced moment is 10 20 less for the vwhp which is useful for the design to mitigate overturning if the results are used for the design of caissons with d l 1 4 2 3 wave run up and run down fig 11 presents the normalized average maximum run up and run down owing to random waves because the y axis is the average of all the run up values its value is much smaller than that of regular wave results the highest value is 0 8 for the vwhp moreover for a vwhp the run up value decreased with an increase in d l p and was not significant for the vw case as discussed for regular waves the rundown is smaller for the vwhp compared to the vw case 4 2 4 comparison of wave conditions for a vw and a vwhp fig 12 compares the hydrodynamic parameters forces and moments for h i s d 0 21 which is the highest wave energy condition simulated in the wave flume for all wave periods the comparison is similar to that for regular waves although the values are noticeably different the increased wave dissipation helped to reduce wave reflection the inline wave force can be reduced by 50 for higher d l p values such as d l p 0 3 the vertical wave force on the vw with the horizontal plate increased significantly for lower values of d l p especially for d l p 0 1 wave induced moments can be reduced by 10 25 for a vwhp depending on the d l p value overall the merits and demerits of adding a vertical plate to the vw are clearly revealed fig 13 shows that the vwhp helps to reduce the wave run down but has little effect on wave run up 5 conclusions detailed experimental investigations on wave transmission reflection dissipation forces moments run up and rundown on a vw resting on a porous seabed as well as on a vwhp structure were conducted for regular and random waves with a wide range of wave heights and periods the important conclusions of this experimental investigation are as follows 5 1 regular waves in general adding a horizontal plate to the vertical wall helps to reduce wave transmission especially for long waves it helps to reduce wave reflection by 30 40 and increases wave energy dissipation by 20 30 the introduction of a horizontal plate on the vertical wall increases the vertical wave force and wave induced moments on the structure increasing the value of the relative wave height h i d has a significant effect on the shoreward wave force fixing the horizontal plate helps to significantly reduce the seaward wave force adding a horizontal plate helps to reduce the run down coefficient significantly by 20 30 especially for d l 0 2 5 2 random waves wave reflection can be reduced by 25 35 by introducing a horizontal plate and the dissipation can be increased by 25 35 on a vw the normalized significant inline wave force can be reduced from 1 0 to 0 5 with an increase in d l p from 0 1 to 0 5 for a vwhp the value can be reduced from 0 8 to 0 1 the inline wave force can be reduced by 50 for higher d l p values such as d l p 0 3 which is highly beneficial for the design of this type of structure to mitigate horizontal sliding the change in h i s d from 0 071 to 0 21 does not alter the value of the normalized inline forces the vertical forces on the vwhp were significantly higher than those in the vw case the vertical wave force on the vwhp increased significantly for lower values of d l p especially for d l p 0 1 the wave induced moment is 10 20 less for a vwhp which is useful for the design to mitigate overturning especially if the results are used for the design of caissons with d l 1 while applying the study results for field applications it is recommended to provide suitable warning signs and marker buoys to the users about the presence of a submerged horizontal plate on the vertical face of the wall this would help reduce any vessel collisions on the immersed plate in an offshore caisson the vessel should be moored on the lee side and horizontal plate where there is no attachment of the horizontal plate 6 future studies required this detailed experimental investigation of regular and random wave fields helped to reveal the overall merits and demerits of adding a horizontal plate to a vw further research is required to overcome the drawbacks of this new design these can be summarized as follows for regular waves the vertical force upward and downward increased significantly because of the presence of the horizontal plate this observation necessitates further attention and studies on how to reduce such increased vertical forces especially in the upward direction it is important to note that the increase in downward force is not necessarily disadvantageous as it could add stability to the structure against horizontal sliding moreover the introduction of a horizontal plate increased the wave induced moments on the structure and by increasing the value of h i d the shoreward wave force also increased for random waves and as noted with regular waves the vertical forces on the vwhp were significantly higher than those on the vw however the wave induced moment was 10 20 less for the vwhp which is useful for the design to mitigate overturning if the results are used for the design of caissons with d l 1 additional research is needed to address how to reduce the wave force and moment by introducing the porosity of the horizontal plate changing the plate elevation and changing the length of the plate a thorough comparison of the measured results with suitable mathematical model based results will be useful for a wide range of applications credit authorship contribution statement ahmad alyousif conceptualization

20383,as in many other sectors accidents that lead to deaths injuries environmental pollution or material damage occur in the maritime sector maritime transportation operations which constitute the backbone of the maritime industry involve serious risks by nature although many safety measures are implemented to eliminate these risks or reduce them to acceptable levels the number of accidents that occur in maritime operations is quite high within the scope of the present study errors in anchor handling operations aho and their outcomes were analysed using the fuzzy bow tie method the findings of the present study can be used by marine experts maritime s researchers ship masters ship owners and port state officials to reduce potential risks during aho operations and increase maritime safety keywords anchor handling risk assessment bow tie method fuzzy logic 1 introduction more than 80 of global transportation by volume is carried out by sea through a global fleet consisting of more than 53 000 ships united nations 2020 maritime operations involve many operations such as navigation loading discharging port manoeuvre and anchorage among these operations the purpose of anchorage is to keep the ship in a certain marine space without using the main engine throughout the waiting time for berthing channel crossings and other similar manoeuvres on the other hand anchor handling operations are among the most dangerous due to the high risk of human error and errors related to operational conditions liu et al 2010 martins and maturana 2010 tjøm et al 2010 debnath and chin 2016 wang and yang 2018 rutkowski 2019 according to the joint report prepared by the international class organization det norske veritas germanischer lloyd with insurance companies gard and swedish club between 2007 and 2015 an average of 8 10 anchor losses were reported for every 1000 dnv gl classed ships outcomes such as the cost of removing the anchor from the seabed losing the rental income from the ship damage to subsea equipment or subsequent collisions and grounding accidents occur as a result of anchor losses dnvgl 2016 in the literature there are studies on the risk analysis of maritime operations islam et al 2017 pazouki et al 2018 environmental pollution kaptan et al 2020 and accidents such as collisions hänninen and kujala 2012 arici et al 2020 grounding accidents akhtar and utne 2014 fires and explosions sarıalioğlu et al 2020 the previous studies on aho can be classified into two groups the first group of studies is on offshore anchor handling wu et al 2015 examined the anchor handling vessel ahv thrust capacity during offshore anchor deployment in a deep water situation when high external forces wind tide wave etc are expected over the bourbon dolphin accident the causes of the accident were determined as the unfavourable positioning of the bourbon dolphin and the reduction of propeller force as a result of the mooring line configuration the researchers stated that this type of analysis can be used to define ship specific limitations and choose the suitable ship for a specific mission another offshore aho risk analysis study was conducted by wang et al 2014 in the said study the interaction between the anchor tensional mooring and ahv during the anchorage operation was examined the researchers proposed a quasi static approach to be used in simulating this situation as a result of the study the researchers made various suggestions in terms of anchor anchor length and surface behaviours for the successful application of aho similarly tjøm et al 2010 conducted experiments on the ideal application of offshore aho in an environment with high environmental sensitivity as a result of the study the researchers proposed a new type of buoy that maximizes time efficiency and minimizes maritime traffic and environmental impact the second group of studies is on the accident s risks and anchor behaviour during anchorage process in the study conducted by debnath and chin 2016 the navigational traffic conflict technique ntct was used to measure collision potentials in anchorage areas and investigate the factors contributing to collisions the researchers determined that the risk of collision is high in anchorages attached to the shoreline and international fairways and low in conditions with large numbers of isolated danger marks and day conditions another collision risk analysis in anchorage area study was conducted by liu et al 2020 their studies obtained a collision risk index model for anchoring based on regional and ship risk they tested this model using automatic identification system ais data from ships in the shandong anchorage area in the north yellow sea they stated that the proposed model determined the risk of collision and could serve as a reference for anchorage area security analysis liu et al 2010 examined the mechanical and kinematic behaviours of drag anchors in a model experimental system through a specially designed multi parameter measurement technique the researchers provided fundamental information regarding the problems that cause drag such as the shank angle the initial direction of the anchor the penetration direction of the anchor the relationship between the fluke direction and the drag angle and the relationship between the drag distance and the anchor displacement the number of risk analysis studies on the risks and outcomes of aho applications performed in ships is limited in the present study the bow tie method which uses the fault tree analysis fta and event tree analysis eta methods in conjunction was implemented in a fuzzy set medium based on expert opinion to analyse the errors in maritime aho applications and their outcomes the article is composed as follows the present section consists of the purpose of the article and literature review section 2 contains an overview of the methods used section 3 describes the methodology used in the article section 4 includes a comprehensive quantitative risk analysis related to aho with the aim of demonstrating the application of the proposed method in the final section the article is concluded with suggestions on the subject and recommendations regarding future studies 2 background 2 1 bow tie analysis the bow tie analysis shows the risks of major accidents that may occur within the system or enterprise at the centre point of the bow tie diagrams created is the critical event in bow tie analyses the fault tree method is used on the left side to determine the causes of the danger and the event tree method is used on the right side to determine the outcomes of the danger de dianous and fiévez 2006 shahriar et al 2012 the basic approach of the method is simple and it combines the analyses of causes and outcomes on a single diagram 2 2 fuzzy set theory zadeh 1965 who developed the fuzzy set theory defined fuzzy set as a class that consists of objects with a continuous array of membership degrees a membership function defines such a set and assigns a membership degree between zero and one to each object here the number 0 indicates that the object in question is not a member of the set while the number 1 indicates that the object is a full member of the set and any number between 0 and 1 indicates the membership degree or partial membership of the object if a is a member of the set in r membership function x is formed in the interval r 0 1 in other words if set a is within the range a a 1 a 3 membership function μ a ˇ x can be generally formulated with equation 1 1 μ

result of the fta diagram is used as the initiating event in the event tree analysis each branch of the initiating event will split into two depending on whether the following event occurs or not depending on the outcome of the following ie the branches that were left behind will keep splitting into two this process continues in the same manner until all events on the system are examined the

affected by the significance of each expert from varied aspects educational level work experience and differences in field of expertise can be counted among the reasons why experts have different opinions on the same event for this reason the fact that the experts in a heterogeneous group have different experiences and knowledge causes the emergence of different interpretations and decisions regarding basic events it is quite important to collect the data obtained as a result of expert evaluation and establish agreement among the opinions therefore an m amount of quantitative data opinion obtained from an m number of experts are combined for each basic event different approaches are used in the literature lin and wang 1997 hun hong and young do 1997 clemen and winkler 1999 in the present study the approach proposed by hsu and chen 1994 involving the collection of different linguistic answers and their conversion into a format suitable for the fuzzy logic method was applied it

outcome ferdous et al 2009 4 application in this section risk analyses of anchor losses that occur during anchorage operations and subsequent accidents such as collision and grounding were performed using the fuzzy bow tie method 4 1 bow tie development ft and et diagrams were created in accordance with the application steps indicated in the methodology section of the present study the ft diagram

anchor loss table 2 4 2 marine expert evaluations the group of experts supporting the present study is a heterogeneous group involving individuals with titles such as marine pilot port state control officer operation manager academician and master the experts evaluating the effects of basic events are experienced people who have worked in different positions in the maritime industry for many years in this phase the experts were weighted based on their professional position vocational competence and work experience table 3 shows the weighting scores of the experts score values from 0 to 5 were selected for each expert to reflect the differences in evaluation table 4 shows data regarding the weighting calculations of the experts 4 3 fuzzification stage the linguistic expressions of the marine experts were converted into fuzzy numbers using a numerical approximation method in this context expert opinions on basic events with unknown failure rates were taken according to the reference

computation of mcs and te failure probability the probability values of the basic events obtained from the defuzzification stage to the probability generation stages were placed on the fault tree and the probabilities of the mcss and the te were calculated the probability value of te was calculated as 3 27e 02 following this process equation 9 was used to determine the importance of each mcs on the fault tree in the present study there were 234 mcss in total for the top event table 11 shows 10 cut sets with the highest ranking values 4 7 calculation of the probabilities for eta results under the supervision of 10 marine experts an et diagram was created regarding anchor loss during aho as the initiating event the probability of each outcome was calculated based on the linguistic evaluation of the experts fig 6 shows the ft and et diagrams and the occurrence probability of each outcome 5 findings and discussion as a result of the fuzzy fault tree analysis the probability of anchor loss during the anchor handling operation te of the problem was determined as 3 27e 02 in order to reduce the risks calculated bes with high occurrence must be eliminated the decisions made by the marine experts indicate that te was affected the most by be16 be19 be7 be26 and be18 table 10 additionally the be16 be19 be16 be26 be17 be26 be17 be19 be7 be19 mcs are significant errors that affect the occurrence probability of the te table 11 as a result of the analysis it was determined that be16 deep water is the most significant root cause in the occurrence of anchor losses deepwater anchorage operations are performed at depth values above 82 5 m dnvgl 2016 this type of anchorage should be avoided if possible however it is not possible to avoid deep water anchorage in large commercial areas around the world unlike standard anchorage handling deep water anchorage operations involve difficulties such as the common absence of chain length that is suitable for the depth and difficulty controlling the chain flow rate while letting go of the anchor since it is aimed to prevent the ship from dragging the anchor loss and collision rates are high in areas with strong wind and high density of anchored ships graziano et al 2016 prior to deep water anchorage it is necessary for the shipmaster to collect information from admiralty sailing directions guides to port entry large scale maps and local sources as stated by rutkowski 2019 the shipmaster should plan and implement a suitable course of action with bridge team management members depending on the capstan chain length and manoeuvre characteristics of the ship be19 high speed during dropping anchor is the second important root cause it is the cause of many maritime accidents and is completely related to human error these are errors resulting from dropping or slipping the anchor without setting the speed of the ship to zero or when the speed is above the capstan limits in determining the speed of the ship the shipmaster should make a decision by taking many factors into consideration such as the speed direction of the wind density of the anchorage area steerage way of the ship etc weng et al 2012 be7 swivel is the chain element that consists of two links between the anchor and the chain one of which remains stationary when the other twists and prevents the chains from kinking it is also the weakest element of the chain it has a structure that can easily cause problems the only way to prevent equipment related anchor losses is to create a deck planned maintenance system and perform complete routine maintenance and checks islam et al 2018 if repairs have been made on the anchor and the chain contacting class organizations and having checks performed can be considered as the most preventative factor another important be was identified as be 26 overload on the chain these are faults that occur as a result of anchor equipment exceeding the limits specified by the international association of classification societies iacs intertanko 2019 when dropping and heaving the anchor and at anchorage the chain is overloaded due to the wind current and the ship s speed this can be prevented through frequent reporting of tension direction of chain from the attendant officer to the shipmaster during anchorage handling and the shipmaster using the suitable machinery and steering instruction finally within the scope of the present study be 18 the nature of the seabed was identified as another root cause of anchor loss the holding power of the anchor differs depending on the nature of the seabed clay shingle sand cobbles rock liu et al 2010 for this reason the shipmaster should plan the length of the chain to be deployed to the sea by considering the duration of stay in the area to be anchored the holding power of the seabed and expected or seasonal weather conditions in the accident occurrence combinations generated within the scope of the ffta method it was observed that the combinations listed among the aforementioned bes had the highest probabilities table 11 accidents that occur during aho can be given as examples to the said combinations maib 2007 atsb 2008 japan p i association 2013 msiu 2016 it is not possible to eliminate the environmental conditions me 7 that cause accidents on the other hand the determination of the safe course of action that may reduce or eliminate the effects of operational conditions is the only way to prevent the occurrence of anchor related accidents 6 conclusion maritime transportation stands out among the types of carriage and transportation due to its low transportation costs despite this advantage maritime transportation operations involve risks that may cause damage to freightage the marine environment ship structure and human life it is quite important to identify the risks related to aho which is one of these operations the present study aims to increase maritime safety in operational terms by describing the anchor losses that occur during anchorage operations through quantitative risk analysis the bow tie method based on fuzzy logic was used to estimate risks as a result of the study the basic events and the top event causing anchor losses were revealed and their occurrence probabilities were calculated according to the calculated priorities of the mcss fv i that cause the occurrence of the te it was determined that be16 be19 are the factors that have the largest impact on accidents therefore it was concluded that planning and in service training activities prior to anchorage operations should be improved and standardized the results obtained and the suggestions made can be utilized by maritime safety researchers shipmasters ship operators and port state officials in the future researchers are recommended to work on the development of new systems to eliminate the risks of anchor losses or to reduce them to an acceptable risk value recommended systems are sensor or control system that allows instantaneous monitoring of chain flow rate new generation chain stopper equipment that enables chain breaking load control and automation systems that would allow for the control and monitoring of the anchor winch engine over the bridge it is thought that thanks to these systems the situational awareness of ship crew about the limits of anchor handling equipment will increase declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
20383,as in many other sectors accidents that lead to deaths injuries environmental pollution or material damage occur in the maritime sector maritime transportation operations which constitute the backbone of the maritime industry involve serious risks by nature although many safety measures are implemented to eliminate these risks or reduce them to acceptable levels the number of accidents that occur in maritime operations is quite high within the scope of the present study errors in anchor handling operations aho and their outcomes were analysed using the fuzzy bow tie method the findings of the present study can be used by marine experts maritime s researchers ship masters ship owners and port state officials to reduce potential risks during aho operations and increase maritime safety keywords anchor handling risk assessment bow tie method fuzzy logic 1 introduction more than 80 of global transportation by volume is carried out by sea through a global fleet consisting of more than 53 000 ships united nations 2020 maritime operations involve many operations such as navigation loading discharging port manoeuvre and anchorage among these operations the purpose of anchorage is to keep the ship in a certain marine space without using the main engine throughout the waiting time for berthing channel crossings and other similar manoeuvres on the other hand anchor handling operations are among the most dangerous due to the high risk of human error and errors related to operational conditions liu et al 2010 martins and maturana 2010 tjøm et al 2010 debnath and chin 2016 wang and yang 2018 rutkowski 2019 according to the joint report prepared by the international class organization det norske veritas germanischer lloyd with insurance companies gard and swedish club between 2007 and 2015 an average of 8 10 anchor losses were reported for every 1000 dnv gl classed ships outcomes such as the cost of removing the anchor from the seabed losing the rental income from the ship damage to subsea equipment or subsequent collisions and grounding accidents occur as a result of anchor losses dnvgl 2016 in the literature there are studies on the risk analysis of maritime operations islam et al 2017 pazouki et al 2018 environmental pollution kaptan et al 2020 and accidents such as collisions hänninen and kujala 2012 arici et al 2020 grounding accidents akhtar and utne 2014 fires and explosions sarıalioğlu et al 2020 the previous studies on aho can be classified into two groups the first group of studies is on offshore anchor handling wu et al 2015 examined the anchor handling vessel ahv thrust capacity during offshore anchor deployment in a deep water situation when high external forces wind tide wave etc are expected over the bourbon dolphin accident the causes of the accident were determined as the unfavourable positioning of the bourbon dolphin and the reduction of propeller force as a result of the mooring line configuration the researchers stated that this type of analysis can be used to define ship specific limitations and choose the suitable ship for a specific mission another offshore aho risk analysis study was conducted by wang et al 2014 in the said study the interaction between the anchor tensional mooring and ahv during the anchorage operation was examined the researchers proposed a quasi static approach to be used in simulating this situation as a result of the study the researchers made various suggestions in terms of anchor anchor length and surface behaviours for the successful application of aho similarly tjøm et al 2010 conducted experiments on the ideal application of offshore aho in an environment with high environmental sensitivity as a result of the study the researchers proposed a new type of buoy that maximizes time efficiency and minimizes maritime traffic and environmental impact the second group of studies is on the accident s risks and anchor behaviour during anchorage process in the study conducted by debnath and chin 2016 the navigational traffic conflict technique ntct was used to measure collision potentials in anchorage areas and investigate the factors contributing to collisions the researchers determined that the risk of collision is high in anchorages attached to the shoreline and international fairways and low in conditions with large numbers of isolated danger marks and day conditions another collision risk analysis in anchorage area study was conducted by liu et al 2020 their studies obtained a collision risk index model for anchoring based on regional and ship risk they tested this model using automatic identification system ais data from ships in the shandong anchorage area in the north yellow sea they stated that the proposed model determined the risk of collision and could serve as a reference for anchorage area security analysis liu et al 2010 examined the mechanical and kinematic behaviours of drag anchors in a model experimental system through a specially designed multi parameter measurement technique the researchers provided fundamental information regarding the problems that cause drag such as the shank angle the initial direction of the anchor the penetration direction of the anchor the relationship between the fluke direction and the drag angle and the relationship between the drag distance and the anchor displacement the number of risk analysis studies on the risks and outcomes of aho applications performed in ships is limited in the present study the bow tie method which uses the fault tree analysis fta and event tree analysis eta methods in conjunction was implemented in a fuzzy set medium based on expert opinion to analyse the errors in maritime aho applications and their outcomes the article is composed as follows the present section consists of the purpose of the article and literature review section 2 contains an overview of the methods used section 3 describes the methodology used in the article section 4 includes a comprehensive quantitative risk analysis related to aho with the aim of demonstrating the application of the proposed method in the final section the article is concluded with suggestions on the subject and recommendations regarding future studies 2 background 2 1 bow tie analysis the bow tie analysis shows the risks of major accidents that may occur within the system or enterprise at the centre point of the bow tie diagrams created is the critical event in bow tie analyses the fault tree method is used on the left side to determine the causes of the danger and the

the marine experts indicate that te was affected the most by be16 be19 be7 be26 and be18 table 10 additionally the be16 be19 be16 be26 be17 be26 be17 be19 be7 be19 mcs are significant errors that affect the occurrence probability of the te table 11 as a result of the analysis it was determined that be16 deep water is the most significant root cause in the occurrence of anchor losses deepwater anchorage operations are performed at depth values above 82 5 m dnvgl 2016 this type of anchorage should be avoided if possible however it is not possible to avoid deep water anchorage in large commercial areas around the world unlike standard anchorage handling deep water anchorage operations involve difficulties such as the common absence of chain length that is suitable for the depth and difficulty controlling the chain flow rate while letting go of the anchor since it is aimed to prevent the ship from dragging the anchor loss and collision rates are high in areas with strong wind and high density of anchored ships graziano et al 2016 prior to deep water anchorage it is necessary for the shipmaster to collect information from admiralty sailing directions guides to port entry large scale maps and local sources as stated by rutkowski 2019 the shipmaster should plan and implement a suitable course of action with bridge team management members depending on the capstan chain length and manoeuvre characteristics of the ship be19 high speed during dropping anchor is the second important root cause it is the cause of many maritime accidents and is completely related to human error these are errors resulting from dropping or slipping the anchor without setting the speed of the ship to zero or when the speed is above the capstan limits in determining the speed of the ship the shipmaster should make a decision by taking many factors into consideration such as the speed direction of the wind density of the anchorage area steerage way of the ship etc weng et al 2012 be7 swivel is the chain element that consists of two links between the anchor and the chain one of which remains stationary when the other twists and prevents the chains from kinking it is also the weakest element of the chain it has a structure that can easily cause problems the only way to prevent equipment related anchor losses is to create a deck planned maintenance system and perform complete routine maintenance and checks islam et al 2018 if repairs have been made on the anchor and the chain contacting class organizations and having checks performed can be considered as the most preventative factor another important be was identified as be 26 overload on the chain these are faults that occur as a result of anchor equipment exceeding the limits specified by the international association of classification societies iacs intertanko 2019 when dropping and heaving the anchor and at anchorage the chain is overloaded due to the wind current and the ship s speed this can be prevented through frequent reporting of tension direction of chain from the attendant officer to the shipmaster during anchorage handling and the shipmaster using the suitable machinery and steering instruction finally within the scope of the present study be 18 the nature of the seabed was identified as another root cause of anchor loss the holding power of the anchor differs depending on the nature of the seabed clay shingle sand cobbles rock liu et al 2010 for this reason the shipmaster should plan the length of the chain to be deployed to the sea by considering the duration of stay in the area to be anchored the holding power of the seabed and expected or seasonal weather conditions in the accident occurrence combinations generated within the scope of the ffta method it was observed that the combinations listed among the aforementioned bes had the highest probabilities table 11 accidents that occur during aho can be given as examples to the said combinations maib 2007 atsb 2008 japan p i association 2013 msiu 2016 it is not possible to eliminate the environmental conditions me 7 that cause accidents on the other hand the determination of the safe course of action that may reduce or eliminate the effects of operational conditions is the only way to prevent the occurrence of anchor related accidents 6 conclusion maritime transportation stands out among the types of carriage and transportation due to its low transportation costs despite this advantage maritime transportation operations involve risks that may cause damage to freightage the marine environment ship structure and human life it is quite important to identify the risks related to aho which is one of these operations the present study aims to increase maritime safety in operational terms by describing the anchor losses that occur during anchorage operations through quantitative risk analysis the bow tie method based on fuzzy logic was used to estimate risks as a result of the study the basic events and the top event causing anchor losses were revealed and their occurrence probabilities were calculated according to the calculated priorities of the mcss fv i that cause the occurrence of the te it was determined that be16 be19 are the factors that have the largest impact on accidents therefore it was concluded that planning and in service training activities prior to anchorage operations should be improved and standardized the results obtained and the suggestions made can be utilized by maritime safety researchers shipmasters ship operators and port state officials in the future researchers are recommended to work on the development of new systems to eliminate the risks of anchor losses or to reduce them to an acceptable risk value recommended systems are sensor or control system that allows instantaneous monitoring of chain flow rate new generation chain stopper equipment that enables chain breaking load control and automation systems that would allow for the control and monitoring of the anchor winch engine over the bridge it is thought that thanks to these systems the situational awareness of ship crew about the limits of anchor handling equipment will increase declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

underwater glider 1 introduction recently underwater gliders ugs have attracted researchers attention for their low cost autonomy long range high endurance and broad applications in oceanography recently jamieson 2018 sanchez et al 2020 this concept was firstly proposed by stommel 1989 and subsequently several prominent ugs such as spray sherman et al 2001 seaglider eriksen et al 2001 slocum webb et al 2001 deepglider osse and eriksen 2007 and fòlaga alvarez et al 2009 caffaz et al 2010 have been developed and widely used in oceanic observations driven by net buoyancy a ug s gravity minus its buoyancy ugs can glide through water columns sensors carried by ugs can monitor oceanic activities and collect data for oceanic research however the velocities of ugs and ocean currents are on the same scale and ocean currents thus plays an important role in the motion performances of ugs including their stability maneuverability and cruising ability to study the effects of ocean currents on the motion characteristics of ugs a dynamic model of ugs should first be established fossen 1991 1994 2011 built a dynamic model for an underwater vehicle using the newton euler method the momentum theorem and the theorem of the moment of momentum have been used to establish rigid body dynamics models of ugs leonard and graver 2001 bhatta and leonard 2003 graver 2005 wang and wang 2009 deduced the gibbs function of an ug system and established a rigid body dynamics model based on multibody dynamics theory additionally to improve the prediction accuracy of the dynamic model more environmental factors have been incorporated such as the driving force loss incurred by variations of seawater density and shell compression yang y et al 2017 gao et al 2017 yang m et al 2019 and ocean currents fan and woolsey 2014 zhang et al 2013 obtained the spiraling steady state equations and verified their dynamic model using experimental data yu et al 2013 optimized the steady motion

conducted studies to research the motion performances of torpedoes submarines and underwater vehicles minnick 2006 phillips et al 2007 yi et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 although ugs are driven by buoyancy rather than propellers similar methods have been used to analyze their performances for example a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach has been proposed to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients and this has been validated with experimental data the trajectories of gliders have been tested and compared with numerical results to analyze the motion characteristics of a laboratory ug in the vertical plane singh et al 2017 singh et al 2014 the maneuverability of ugs is evaluated by their turn radius page et al 2016 yang y et al 2020 derived the applicable free perturbation equations and maneuverability equations to evaluate the stability and maneuverability of ugs however few works have quantitatively evaluated the motion performances of ugs considering the effects of ocean currents for this purpose a dynamic model of ugs considering ocean current was derived in this study to clarify the effects of ocean currents on the motion performances of the ug the relative speed between the ocean current and the ug is calculated then hydrodynamic forces and moments are calculated using the relative speed and hydrodynamic coefficients all external forces and moments including hydrodynamic forces and moments are input into the dynamic model and the motion of the ug is acquired by solving the dynamic model our dynamic model is different from that used by merckelbach et al 2010 in which the speed of a ug in the presence of an ocean current is calculated from the vector sum of the ocean current and the ug s velocity in still water in our paper motion performances of a ug including its stability maneuverability and cruising ability considering ocean currents are evaluated quantitatively a comprehensive parameter is proposed that combines the stability maneuverability and cruising ability parameters the comprehensive parameter can be used for evaluation of motion performances of different ugs considering ocean currents a dynamic model considering ocean currents will also be useful in path planning and optimization of the control strategy of ugs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the dynamic model considering ocean currents is established in section 3 the results of simulations are discussed and the stability maneuverability and cruising ability of ugs are analyzed conclusions and future work are summarized in section 4 2 underwater glider dynamics considering ocean currents two reference frames the inertial reference frame and the body fixed reference frame are established to derive the dynamic equations of the ug as shown in fig 1 for the inertial reference frame e xyz the origin e is fixed at one point of the sea surface the ex axis points to the north the ez axis is parallel with the acceleration of gravity and the ey axis complies with the right handed rule for the body fixed reference frame o xyz the origin o is coincident with the center of buoyancy of the ug the ox axis is

discussion in this study the petrel ii ug liu 2014 developed at tianjin university china was chosen to examine the dynamic behavior of an ug considering ocean currents the physical and hydrodynamic parameters for petrel ii ug are listed in table 1 yang et al 2020 singh et al 2014 ugs are driven by net buoyancy which equals their gravity minus their buoyancy the mass m of the petrel ii ug which includes the mass of the hull and the internal moving mass is constant and its buoyancy is changeable there is a bladder outside the hull and an oil tank inside the hull oil can flow between the external bladder and the oil tank under the action of the hydraulic pump during the descent process oil flows from the external bladder to the oil tank and the buoyancy of the petrel ii ug decreases conversely during the ascent process oil flows from the oil tank to the external bladder and the buoyancy of the petrel ii ug increases when the net buoyancy is zero the oil volume in the external bladder is 0 91 l the stability maneuverability and cruising ability are three important aspects that can be used to evaluate motion performances of ugs motion simulations of the petrel ii ug were conducted to research the effects of ocean currents on their motion performances based on the dynamic model during our simulations the depth of submergence h was 1000 m in the simulated descending process the oil volume in the external bladder was 0 35 l and the axial position of the movable battery package was 5 mm in the simulated ascending process these were 1 19 l and 10 mm respectively the rotational angle of the movable battery package is set at 0 for steady gliding motion and 40 for steady spiral motion unless otherwise stated the heading of the ug is along the ox axis direction besides the seawater density increases with the depth of seawater when the depth increases from 0 to 1000 m the seawater density increases by 1 this increase will significantly change the volume of the hull and the driving force of the petrel ii ug for example in the descending process the driving force is 7 n at the surface but it s only 1 n at a depth of 1000 m the loss of driving force caused by changes in the seawater density is considered in our study yang y et al 2017 yang m et al 2019 3 1 verification of the dynamic model in order to ensure the validity of the dynamic model derived above the petrel ii ug underwent a sea trial from 8 to july 19 2020 for a performance test in the south china sea a total of 125 gliding cycles were obtained from this sea trial the gliding profile data from sea trials no 24 and no 51 were compared with the simulation results of the dynamic model table 2 shows the two groups of motion parameters set in the sea trial for gliding profiles no 24 and no 51 respectively the petrel ii ug uses an electronic compass and a conductivity temperature and depth ctd sensor to measure its own pitch angle and submergence depth the ug s vertical velocity can be obtained by dividing the submergence depth by the ctd sensor s sampling interval thus the ug s pitch angle vertical velocity and motion trajectory could be compared between the simulations and the sea trial and the results are illustrated in fig 2 it can be seen that there is a good consistency between the results of the simulations and those from the sea trial which demonstrates the validity of the dynamic model 3 2 stability analysis stability measures the ability of the pitch angle of a ug to return to its original state after being disturbed the response time taken to return to the pitch angle of the undisturbed state t p provides a basis for evaluating the stability of a ug to clarify the effects of ocean currents on the stability of the petrel ⅱ ug we set the pitch angle to be 20 when the submarine depth was between 200 m and 210 m in the descending process four simulations of the ug were then conducted in still water with an axial ocean current with a lateral ocean current and with a vertical ocean current the results of these simulations are shown in figs 3 7 fig 3 shows that the pitch angle increases from 40 to 20 and is maintained at 20 between 605 s and 655 s for the case with a disturbance compared with the results of the undisturbed case it takes 50 s for the pitch angle to return to the undisturbed state fig 4 shows that when the motion of the petrel ⅱ ug is disturbed its forward speed varies between 0 4 m s and 0 48 m s and its vertical speed varies between 0 2 m s and 0 4 m s after the disturbance disappears the speed of the petrel ⅱ ug is restored to an undisturbed state from this it can be concluded that the petrel ⅱ ug has good self stability after being disturbed in still water in figs 3 7 it can be seen that when the ocean current is in the axial or lateral direction the pitch angle is maintained at 20 between 605 s and 655 s and returns to the undisturbed state 50 s later when the ocean current is 0 0 0 1 t m s the pitch angle of 20 is maintained for 35 s and returns to an undisturbed state 50 s later when the ocean current is 0 0 0 1 t m s the pitch angle of 20 is maintained for 100 s and returns to an undisturbed state 50 s later these findings support the conclusion that after being disturbed the pitch angle will return to an undisturbed state and the presence of an ocean current does not affect the response time t p 3 3 maneuverability analysis when the ocean current is ignored υ r 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 and μ c 0 0 0 t then eq 12 is solved to acquire attack angle α and dimensionless yaw angular velocity ω z omitting the second order terms of velocity or angular velocity 13 α x 0 cos ϕ z α tan θ 14 ω z 1 2 ρ s l x 0 n β cot θ sin ϕ m n β 1 2 ρ s y r n β n r y β relative rotation radius r z of the steady spiral motion is derived to quantitatively evaluate the maneuverability of ugs this is equal to rotation radius r z divided by the length of the ug l according to the formula of steady circular motion and the definition of dimensionless of yaw angular velocity eqs 15 and 16 were obtained 15 r z r cos γ ω z 16 ω z ω z l r furthermore considering eqs 14 16 and assuming that gliding angle γ is equal to the pitch angle θ the relative rotation radius r z is obtained 17 r z cos γ ω z m 1 2 ρ s y r n r y β n β 1 2 ρ s l x 0 sin θ sin ϕ with the assumption that the ug glides with a small attack angle from eq 17 the value of r z considering no ocean current depends on the ug s structure parameters m s and l the seawater density ρ pitch angle θ roll angle ϕ and the hydrodynamic coefficients x 0 y β y r n β n r the value of r z is inversely proportional to the drag coefficient with zero attack angle x 0 and the value of sin ϕ and it is proportional to the value of sin θ when the roll angle is zero the value of r z is infinity and the ug will lose maneuverability to verify the results of the theoretical analysis motion simulations of spiral motion were conducted the rotational angle of the movable battery package was maintained at 40 and the petrel ii ug performed spiral motion in three dimensional space fig 8 shows the spiral motion trajectory of ugs without considering the ocean current in one profile the left hand side of the figure shows the petrel ⅱ ug descending from the sea surface to the desired depth and the right hand side of the figure shows the ascent from the desired depth to the sea surface in the descending process it turned clockwise and the rotation radius gradually decreased in the ascending process it turned counterclockwise and the rotation radius also gradually decreased as the movable battery package was maintained at 40 the roll angle was 39 7 and the pitch angle and yaw angle rate were both negative in the descending process this is known as anti helical motion liu et al 2016 fig 9 illustrates the pitch angle and resultant velocity of spiral motion considering no ocean current this single profile motion can be divided into four stages an unsteady descending stage lasting from 0 to 340 s a steady descending stage lasting from 340 s to 5900 s an unsteady descending to ascending stage lasting from 5900 s to 6400 s and a steady ascending stage lasting from 6400 s to 8860 s in the first stage the reduction in oil volume in the external bladder causes an increase in driving force this increase leads to a corresponding increase in the resultant velocity of the petrel ⅱ ug according to eq 6 the hydrodynamic moment of pitching increases as the velocity increases to balance this hydrodynamic moment the absolute value of the pitch angle of the petrel ⅱ ug increases thus the resultant velocity increases from 0 to 0 67 m s and the pitch angle changes from 10 to 42 in the second stage the oil volume in the external bladder is constant however the driving force loss caused by the change in seawater density which was noted above incurs a decrease in velocity this decrease in velocity reduces the hydrodynamic moment of pitching and the absolute value of the pitch angle decreases with the hydrodynamic moment besides comparing fig 8 and 9 we can see that the variation tendency of the rotation radius is similar to that of the pitch angle the results of the simulations indicate that variation of oil volume in the external bladder and variation of seawater density can change the driving force of the ug this variation in driving force then changes the rotation radius of the ug by changing its resultant velocity and pitch angle figs 10 12 illustrate the spiral motion trajectories of the petrel ⅱ ug under the influence of ocean currents in order to compare the maneuverability of the ug under the influence of different ocean currents motion trajectories are projected on the exy plane and the relative rotation radius r z is equal to half the maximum distance between two points on the projected curve of motion trajectory divided by the ug s length l from the above simulation results the values of r z are 841 839 833 848 18 and 19 respectively it is concluded that the ug will drift away along with the ocean current when their velocity has the same magnitude as the speed of ocean current in the axial and lateral directions which decreases the ug s maneuverability however it still has a similar relative rotation radius when encountering an ocean current in the vertical direction 3 4 cruising ability analysis a single profile refers to the ug descending from the ocean surface to the desired depth and then ascending from the desired depth back to the ocean surface the distance between the entry point and the exit point of the ug is known as the voyage of the ug in one profile r v to simplify the analysis r v is used to evaluate the cruising ability of the ug without considering energy consumption as the ocean current is ignored r v can be expressed as 18 r v 2 h tan γ to further understand the effects of ocean currents on the cruising ability of a ug simulations were conducted based on eq 12 to acquire the motion parameters of the petrel ⅱ ug for each profile the ocean current was regarded as being constant and all simulation cases had the same entry point 0 0 fig 13 presents the gliding motion trajectories of the ug in three dimensional space from two different views when the ocean current is 0 m s the voyage of the ug in one profile is 2830 m with the exit point 2830 0 when the ocean current is 0 4 0 0 t m s and 0 4 0 0 t m s the voyage is 5810 m with the exit point 5810 0 and 154 m with the exit point 154 0 respectively when the ocean current is 0 0 4 0 t m s and 0 0 4 0 t m s the voyage of the ug in one profile is 4118 m with the exit point 2826 2995 and 4118 m with the exit point 2826 2995 respectively when the ocean current is 0 0 0 1 t m s and 0 0 0 1 t m s the voyage is 2645 m with the exit point 2645 0 and 4884 m with the exit point 4884 0 respectively from these results we have drawn the following conclusions a positive axial ocean current or a negative vertical ocean current can improve the cruising ability of the ug remarkably under the effect of a lateral ocean current the ug will significantly deviate from their specified trajectory the ug will lose cruising ability when encountering a negative axial ocean current with a speed similar to the magnitude of their velocity 3 4 1 absolute gliding angles here we define the absolute gliding angle as shown in eq 19 if the ocean current is ignored the absolute gliding angle γ a is equal to the gliding angle γ 19 γ a θ tan 1 z b x b where x b y b z b t t b i x y z t fig 14 shows the absolute gliding angle of the petrel ⅱ ug with no ocean current in one profile in this single profile there are four stages the unsteady descending stage lasting from 0 to 340 s the steady gliding descending stage lasting from 340 s to 4860 s the descending to ascending stage lasting from 4860 s to 5400 s and the steady gliding ascending stage lasting from 5400 s to 7470 s during the steady gliding descending stage the absolute gliding angle increases from 49 to 23 and the attack angle increases from 1 1 to 3 5 during the steady gliding ascending stage the absolute gliding angle decreases from 52 to 19 and the attack angle decreases from 1 to 4 7 combining eq 18 and eq 19 we find that as the submarine depth of the ug increases in a single profile the value of tan γ a decreases and the voyage of the ug becomes longer fig 15 shows the effects of ocean currents on the absolute gliding angle of the petrel ⅱ ug when the ocean current is 0 4 0 0 t m s the absolute gliding angle changes from 32 to 10 in the steady gliding descending stage which lasts for 4500 s it changes from 36 to 8 5 in the steady gliding ascending stage which lasts for 2000 s the average value of tan γ a is smaller than that in the simulation case without considering the ocean current when the ocean current is 0 4 0 0 t m s the absolute gliding angle decreases from 80 to 110 during 300 s 2950 s decreases from 67 to 52 during 2950 s 4860 s and increases from 80 to 110 during 5360 s 7280 s under the influence of the ocean current of 0 4 0 0 t m s the petrel ⅱ ug cannot glide forward therefore it is concluded that ocean current of 0 4 0 0 t m s will not change the attack angle and the duration of steady gliding motion however it decreases the average value of tan γ a a smaller average value of tan γ a can increase the voyage r v 3 5 comprehensive evaluation stability maneuverability and cruising ability are all important motion performances for evaluating the motion of ugs in order to comprehensively examine the motion performances of ugs considering ocean current a comprehensive parameter ce is proposed in three dimensional vector form as shown in eq 20 which combining the response time taken to return to the pitch angle of the undisturbed state t p the relative rotation radius of steady spiral motion r z and ugs voyage in one profile r v 20 c e t p

underwater glider 1 introduction recently underwater gliders ugs have attracted researchers attention for their low cost autonomy long range high endurance and broad applications in oceanography recently jamieson 2018 sanchez et al 2020 this concept was firstly proposed by stommel 1989 and subsequently several prominent ugs such as spray sherman et al 2001 seaglider eriksen et al 2001 slocum webb et al 2001 deepglider osse and eriksen 2007 and fòlaga alvarez et al 2009 caffaz et al 2010 have been developed and widely used in oceanic observations driven by net buoyancy a ug s gravity minus its buoyancy ugs can glide through water columns sensors carried by ugs can monitor oceanic activities and collect data for oceanic research however the velocities of ugs and ocean currents are on the same scale and ocean currents thus plays an important role in the motion performances of ugs including their stability maneuverability and cruising ability to study the effects of ocean currents on the motion characteristics of ugs a dynamic model of ugs should first be established fossen 1991 1994 2011 built a dynamic model for an underwater vehicle using the newton euler method the momentum theorem and the theorem of the moment of momentum have been used to establish rigid body dynamics models of ugs leonard and graver 2001 bhatta and leonard 2003 graver 2005 wang and wang 2009 deduced the gibbs function of an ug system and established a rigid body dynamics model based on multibody dynamics theory additionally to improve the prediction accuracy of the dynamic model more environmental factors have been incorporated such as the driving force loss incurred by variations of seawater density and shell compression yang y et al 2017 gao et al 2017 yang m et al 2019 and ocean currents fan and woolsey 2014 zhang et al 2013 obtained the spiraling steady state equations and verified their dynamic model using experimental data yu et al 2013 optimized the steady motion

conducted studies to research the motion performances of torpedoes submarines and underwater vehicles minnick 2006 phillips et al 2007 yi et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 although ugs are driven by buoyancy rather than propellers similar methods have been used to analyze their performances for example a computational fluid dynamics cfd approach has been proposed to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients and this has been validated with experimental data the trajectories of gliders have been tested and compared with numerical results to analyze the motion characteristics of a laboratory ug in the vertical plane singh et al 2017 singh et al 2014 the maneuverability of ugs is evaluated by their turn radius page et al 2016 yang y et al 2020 derived the applicable free perturbation equations and maneuverability equations to evaluate the stability and maneuverability of ugs however few works have quantitatively evaluated the motion performances of ugs considering the effects of ocean currents for this purpose a dynamic model of ugs considering ocean current was derived in this study to clarify the effects of ocean currents on the motion performances of the ug the relative speed between the ocean current and the ug is calculated then hydrodynamic forces and moments are calculated using the relative speed and hydrodynamic coefficients all external forces and moments including hydrodynamic forces and moments are input into the dynamic model and the motion of the ug is acquired by solving the dynamic model our dynamic model is different from that used by merckelbach et al 2010 in which the speed of a ug in the presence of an ocean current is calculated from the vector sum of the ocean current and the ug s velocity in still water in our paper motion performances of a ug including its stability maneuverability and cruising ability considering ocean currents are evaluated quantitatively a comprehensive parameter is proposed that combines the stability maneuverability and cruising ability parameters the comprehensive parameter can be used for evaluation of motion performances of different ugs considering ocean currents a dynamic model considering ocean currents will also be useful in path planning and optimization of the control strategy of ugs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the dynamic model considering ocean currents is established in section 3 the results of simulations are discussed and the stability maneuverability and cruising ability of ugs are analyzed conclusions and future work

discussion in this study the petrel ii ug liu 2014 developed at tianjin university china was chosen to examine the dynamic behavior of an ug considering ocean currents the physical and hydrodynamic parameters for petrel ii ug are listed in table 1 yang et al 2020 singh et al 2014 ugs are driven by net buoyancy which equals their gravity minus their buoyancy the mass m of the petrel ii ug which includes the mass of the hull and the internal moving mass is constant and its buoyancy is changeable there is a bladder outside the hull and an oil tank inside the hull oil can flow between the external bladder and the oil tank under the action of the hydraulic pump during the descent process oil flows from the external bladder to the oil tank and the buoyancy of the petrel ii ug decreases conversely during the ascent process oil flows from the oil tank to the external bladder and the buoyancy of the petrel ii ug increases when the net buoyancy is zero the oil volume in the external bladder is 0 91 l the stability maneuverability and cruising ability are three important aspects that can be used to evaluate motion performances of ugs motion simulations of the petrel ii ug were conducted to research the effects of ocean currents on their motion performances based on the dynamic model during our simulations the depth of submergence h was 1000 m in the simulated descending process the oil volume in the external bladder was 0 35 l and the axial position of the movable battery package was 5 mm in the simulated ascending process these were 1 19 l and 10 mm respectively the rotational angle of the movable battery package is set at 0 for steady gliding motion and 40 for steady spiral motion unless otherwise stated the heading of the ug is along the ox axis direction besides the seawater density increases with the depth of seawater when the depth increases from 0 to 1000 m the seawater density increases by 1 this increase will significantly change the volume of the hull and the driving force of the petrel ii ug for example in the descending process the driving force is 7 n at the surface but it s only 1 n at a depth of 1000 m the loss of driving force caused by changes in the seawater density is considered in our study yang y et al 2017 yang m et al 2019 3 1 verification of the dynamic model in order to ensure the validity of the dynamic model derived above the petrel ii ug underwent a sea trial from 8 to july 19 2020 for a performance test in the south china sea a total of 125 gliding cycles were obtained from this sea trial the gliding profile data from sea trials no 24 and no 51 were compared with the simulation results of the dynamic model table 2 shows the two groups of motion parameters set in the sea trial for gliding profiles no 24 and no 51 respectively the petrel ii ug uses an electronic compass and a conductivity temperature and depth ctd sensor to measure its own pitch angle and submergence depth the ug s vertical velocity can be obtained by dividing the submergence depth by the ctd sensor s sampling interval thus the ug s pitch angle vertical velocity and motion trajectory could be compared between the simulations and the sea trial and the results are illustrated in fig 2 it can be seen that there is a good consistency between the results of the simulations and those from the sea trial which demonstrates the validity of the dynamic model 3 2 stability analysis stability measures the ability of the pitch angle of a ug to return to its original state after being disturbed the response time taken to return to the pitch angle of the undisturbed state t p provides a basis for evaluating the stability of a ug to clarify the effects of ocean currents on the stability of the petrel ⅱ ug we set the pitch angle to be 20 when the submarine depth was between 200 m and 210 m in the descending process four simulations of the ug were then conducted in still water with an axial ocean current with a lateral ocean current and with a vertical ocean current the results of these simulations are shown in figs 3 7 fig 3 shows that the pitch angle increases from 40 to 20 and is maintained at 20 between 605 s and 655 s for the case with a disturbance compared with the results of the undisturbed case it takes 50 s for the pitch angle to return to the undisturbed state fig 4 shows that when the motion of the petrel ⅱ ug is disturbed its forward speed varies between 0 4 m s and 0 48 m s and its vertical speed varies between 0 2 m s and 0 4 m s after the disturbance disappears the speed of the petrel ⅱ ug is restored to an undisturbed state from this it can be concluded that the petrel ⅱ ug has good self stability after being disturbed in still water in figs 3 7 it can be seen that when the ocean current is in the axial or lateral direction the pitch angle is maintained at 20 between 605 s and 655 s and returns to the undisturbed state 50 s later when the ocean current is 0 0 0 1 t m s the pitch angle of 20 is maintained for 35 s and returns to an undisturbed state 50 s later when the ocean current is 0 0 0 1 t m s the pitch angle of 20 is maintained for 100 s and returns to an undisturbed state 50 s later these findings support the conclusion that after being disturbed the pitch angle will return to an undisturbed state and the presence of an ocean current does not affect the response time t p 3 3 maneuverability analysis when the ocean current is ignored υ r 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 and μ c 0 0 0 t then eq 12 is solved to acquire attack angle α and dimensionless yaw angular velocity ω z omitting the second order terms of velocity or angular velocity 13 α x 0 cos ϕ z α tan θ 14 ω z 1 2 ρ s l x 0 n β cot θ sin ϕ m n β 1 2 ρ s y r n β n r y β relative rotation radius r z of the steady spiral motion is derived to quantitatively evaluate the maneuverability of ugs this is equal to rotation radius r z divided by the length of the ug l according to the formula of steady circular motion and the definition of dimensionless of yaw angular velocity eqs 15 and 16 were obtained 15 r z r cos γ ω z 16 ω z ω z l r furthermore considering eqs 14 16 and assuming that gliding angle γ is equal to the pitch angle θ the relative rotation radius r z is obtained 17 r z cos γ ω z m 1 2 ρ s y r n r y β n β 1 2 ρ s l x 0 sin θ sin ϕ with the assumption that the ug glides with a small attack angle from eq 17 the value of r z considering no ocean current depends on the ug s structure parameters m s and l the seawater density ρ pitch angle θ roll angle ϕ and the hydrodynamic coefficients x 0 y β y r n β n r the value of r z is inversely proportional to the drag coefficient with zero attack angle x 0 and the value of sin ϕ and it is proportional to the value of sin θ when the roll angle is zero the value of r z is infinity and the ug will lose maneuverability to verify the results of the theoretical analysis motion simulations of spiral motion were conducted the rotational angle of the movable battery package was maintained at 40 and the petrel ii ug performed spiral motion in three dimensional space fig 8 shows the spiral motion trajectory of ugs without considering the ocean current in one profile the left hand side of the figure shows the petrel ⅱ ug descending from the sea surface to the desired depth and the right hand side of the figure shows the ascent from the desired depth to the sea surface in the descending process it turned clockwise and the rotation radius gradually decreased in the ascending process it turned counterclockwise and the rotation radius also gradually decreased as the movable battery package was maintained at 40 the roll angle was 39 7 and the pitch angle and yaw angle rate were both negative in the descending process this is known as anti helical motion liu et al 2016 fig 9 illustrates the pitch angle and resultant velocity of spiral motion considering no ocean current this single profile motion can be divided into four stages an unsteady descending stage lasting from 0 to 340 s a steady descending stage lasting from 340 s to 5900 s an unsteady descending to ascending stage lasting from 5900 s to 6400 s and a steady ascending stage lasting from 6400 s to 8860 s in the first stage the reduction in oil volume in the external bladder causes an increase in driving force this increase leads to a corresponding increase in the resultant velocity of the petrel ⅱ ug according to eq 6 the hydrodynamic moment of pitching increases as the velocity increases to balance this hydrodynamic moment the absolute value of the pitch angle of the petrel ⅱ ug increases thus the resultant velocity increases from 0 to 0 67 m s and the pitch angle changes from 10 to 42 in the second stage the oil volume in the external bladder is constant however the driving force loss caused by the change in seawater density which was noted above incurs a decrease in velocity this decrease in velocity reduces the hydrodynamic moment of pitching and the absolute value of the pitch angle decreases with the hydrodynamic moment besides comparing fig 8 and 9 we can see that the variation tendency of the rotation radius is similar to that of the pitch angle the results of the simulations indicate that variation of oil volume in the external bladder and variation of seawater density can change the driving force of the ug this variation in driving force then changes the rotation radius of the ug by changing its resultant velocity and pitch angle figs 10 12 illustrate the spiral motion trajectories of the petrel ⅱ ug under the influence of ocean currents in order to compare the maneuverability of the ug under the influence of different ocean currents motion trajectories are projected on the exy plane and the relative rotation radius r z is equal to half the maximum distance between two points on the projected curve of motion trajectory divided by the ug s length l from the above simulation results the values of r z are 841 839 833 848 18 and 19 respectively it is concluded that the ug will drift away along with the ocean current when their velocity has the same magnitude as the speed of ocean current in the axial and lateral directions which decreases the ug s maneuverability however it still has a similar relative rotation radius when encountering an ocean current in the vertical direction 3 4 cruising ability analysis a single profile refers to the ug descending from the ocean surface to the desired depth and then ascending from the desired depth back to the ocean surface the distance between the entry point and the exit point of the ug is known as the voyage of the ug in one profile r v to simplify the analysis r v is used to evaluate the cruising ability of the ug without considering energy consumption as the ocean current is ignored r v can be expressed as 18 r v 2 h tan γ to further understand the effects of ocean currents on the cruising ability of a ug simulations were conducted based on eq 12 to acquire the motion parameters of the petrel ⅱ ug for each profile the ocean current was regarded as being constant and all simulation cases had the same entry point 0 0 fig 13 presents the gliding motion trajectories of the ug in three dimensional space from two different views when the ocean current is 0 m s the voyage of the ug in one profile is 2830 m with the exit point 2830 0 when the ocean current is 0 4 0 0 t m s and 0 4 0 0 t m s the voyage is 5810 m with the exit point 5810 0 and 154 m with the exit point 154 0 respectively when the ocean current is 0 0 4 0 t m s and 0 0 4 0 t m s the voyage of the ug in one profile is 4118 m with the exit point 2826 2995 and 4118 m with the exit point 2826 2995 respectively when the ocean current is 0 0 0 1 t m s and 0 0 0 1 t m s the voyage is 2645 m with the exit point 2645 0 and 4884 m with the exit point 4884 0 respectively from these results we have drawn the following conclusions a positive axial ocean current or a negative vertical ocean current can improve the cruising ability of the ug remarkably under the effect of a lateral ocean current the ug will significantly deviate from their specified trajectory the ug will lose cruising ability when encountering a negative axial ocean current with a speed similar to the magnitude of their velocity 3 4 1 absolute gliding angles here we define the absolute gliding angle as shown in eq 19 if the ocean current is ignored the absolute gliding angle γ a is equal to the gliding angle γ 19 γ a θ tan 1 z b x b where x b y b z b t t b i x y z t fig 14 shows the absolute gliding angle of the petrel ⅱ ug with no ocean current in one profile in this single profile there are four stages the unsteady descending stage lasting from 0 to 340 s the steady gliding descending stage lasting from 340 s to 4860 s the descending to ascending stage lasting from 4860 s to 5400 s and the steady gliding ascending stage lasting from 5400 s to 7470 s during the steady gliding descending stage the absolute gliding angle increases from 49 to 23 and the attack angle increases from 1 1 to 3 5 during the steady gliding ascending stage the absolute gliding angle decreases from 52 to 19 and the attack angle decreases from 1 to 4 7 combining eq 18 and eq 19 we find that as the submarine depth of the ug increases in a single profile the value of tan γ a decreases and the voyage of the ug becomes longer fig 15 shows the effects of ocean currents on the absolute gliding angle of the petrel ⅱ ug when the ocean current is 0 4 0 0 t m s the absolute gliding angle changes from 32 to 10 in the steady gliding descending stage which lasts for 4500 s it changes from 36 to 8 5 in the steady gliding ascending stage which lasts for 2000 s the average value of tan γ a is smaller than that in the simulation case without considering the ocean current when the ocean current is 0 4 0 0 t m s the absolute gliding angle decreases from 80 to 110 during 300 s 2950 s decreases from 67 to 52 during 2950 s 4860 s and increases from 80 to 110 during 5360 s 7280 s under the influence of the ocean current of 0 4 0 0 t m s the petrel ⅱ ug cannot glide forward therefore it is concluded that ocean current of 0 4 0 0 t m s will not change the attack angle and the duration of steady gliding motion however it decreases the average value of tan γ a a smaller average value of tan γ a can increase the voyage r v 3 5 comprehensive evaluation stability maneuverability and cruising ability are all important motion performances for evaluating the motion of ugs in order to comprehensively examine the motion performances of ugs considering ocean current a comprehensive parameter ce is proposed in three dimensional vector form as shown in eq 20 which combining the response time taken to return to the pitch angle of the undisturbed state t p the relative rotation radius of steady spiral motion r z and ugs voyage in one profile r v 20 c e t p r z r v t for the petrel ⅱ ug when the ocean current is 0 4 0 0 t m s the value of ce is 50s 841 5810m t thus by comparing the value of ce motion performances of different ugs under the special ocean current could be compared clearly 4 conclusions under the influence of ocean currents a ug perform a three dimensional motion which is more complicated than a gliding motion in a plane in our study a dynamic model of the ug was established to clarify the effects of ocean currents on the motion performances of a ug stability maneuverability and cruising ability in the presence of an ocean current the ocean current is regarded as an external force exerted on the petrel ⅱ ug the response time taken for the ug to return to the pitch angle of its undisturbed state t p the relative rotation radius r z of steady spiral motion and the ug s voyage in one profile r v are proposed to quantitatively evaluate the stability maneuverability and cruising ability respectively furthermore a comprehensive evaluation parameter ce is proposed combining stability maneuverability and cruising ability parameters 1 a disturbance in which the pitch angle is set to 20 when the submarine depth is between 200 m and 210 m was applied to the descending process of the petrel ⅱ ug the results show that the ug are self stable in pitch degree after the disturbance disappears and the presence of an ocean current does not affect the response time t p 2 when the velocity of a ug has the same magnitude as the speed of an ocean current in the axial or lateral direction the ug will drift along with that ocean current this decreases its maneuverability however it still has a similar relative rotation radius when encountering an ocean current in the vertical direction 3 a positive axial ocean current or a negative vertical ocean current could remarkably improve the cruising ability of a ug while under the effect of a lateral ocean current a ug will significantly deviate from its specified trajectory a ug will lose cruising ability when it encounters a negative axial ocean current whose speed is similar to the magnitude of its own velocity 4 a comprehensive evaluation parameter ce is proposed in three dimensional vector form by comparing the values of ce the motion performances of different ugs under particular ocean currents could be clearly compared although a quantitative evaluation model of the motion performances of a ug considering ocean currents has been discussed in this paper some problems still need to be investigated further actual ocean currents vary in time and space and they are hard to measure in the future to verify the accuracy of the quantitative evaluation model sea trials will be conducted with a greater accuracy of ocean current observations furthermore there are other factors such as eddies and internal waves that have been neglected in this study the prediction accuracy of motion performances of a ug will be improved if more accurate environmental factors
