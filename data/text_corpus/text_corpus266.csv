1330,this study contrasts the use of high resolution passive sampling and traditional groundwater monitoring wells gwmw to characterize a chlorinated solvent site and assess the effectiveness of a biowall mulch compost and sand that was installed to remediate trichloroethene tce the primary contaminant of concern high resolution passive profilers hrpps were direct driven hydraulically upgradient within and hydraulically downgradient of the biowall and in close proximity to existing gwmws compared with hydraulically upgradient locations the biowall was highly reducing there were higher densities of bacteria genes capable of reductive dechlorination and tce was being reductively transformed but not completely as cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce was detected within and hydraulically downgradient of the biowall however based on the high resolution data there were a number of important findings which were not discoverable using data from gwmws alone data from the hrpps indicate that the biowall was completely transforming tce to ethene c2h4 except within a high velocity interval where the concentrations were reduced but breakthrough of cis dce was apparent hydraulically upgradient of the biowall concentrations of tce increased with depth where a very low permeability zone exists that will likely remain as a long term source in addition although low concentrations of cis dce were present downgradient of the biowall surfacing into a downgradient stream was not detected this study demonstrates the advantages of high resolution passive sampling of aquifers to assess the performance of remediation techniques compared to traditional methods such as gwmws keywords chlorinated solvents passive sampling biowall pore water velocity csia biodegradation 1 introduction trichloroethene tce and other chlorinated solvents are common contaminants in groundwater systems worldwide huang et al 2019 jin et al 2020 due to the toxicity and carcinogenic nature of tce buhagen et al 2016 chiu et al 2013 numerous biotic and abiotic technologies have been implemented to remediate impacted sites technologies include pump and treat systems in situ chemical oxidation reduction and enhancement of microbial activity through modification of site conditions nunez garcia et al 2020 qian et al 2020 hyldegaard et al 2019 li et al 2019 bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 němeček et al 2016 niño de guzmán et al 2018a yang et al 2018 wu et al 2015 to assess the effectiveness of remediation approaches for sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents it is necessary to collect reliable information on the spatial distribution of the contaminants geochemical conditions chemical and biological transformations microbial community abundances and transport processes generally information on the distribution of contaminants and geochemistry is obtained through groundwater monitoring wells gwmws soil cores and or direct drive devices such membrane interface probes mips on the other hand magnitude and relevance of transport processes such as darcy s flux and dispersion are estimated from hydraulic gradients and conductivities measured in soil cores or through hydraulic profiling tools hpts gwmws the most common monitoring technology tend to overrepresent water from highly permeable strata in heterogeneous soils particularly for standard gwmw screen intervals which typically range between 1 and 10 ft aller 1991 in addition gwmws are not useful in formations with very low hydraulic conductivities given the inability to produce sufficient water schneider et al 2020 alley 1993 direct drive tools such as the mip and the hpt can be used to acquire high resolution data even in low permeability media however they measure permeability rather than pore velocity do not provide speciation of contaminants and provide no data on geochemistry or microbial potential rosenberg et al 2021 a new alternative to traditional monitoring techniques for groundwater is the high resolution passive profiler hrpp schneider et al 2020 the hrpp is a single tool that simultaneously captures information on 1 dissolved species contaminants and geochemical parameters via equilibrium diffusion cells 2 pore water velocity from measurement of mass transfer coefficients schneider et al 2019 3 compound specific stable isotopes and 4 microbial populations the hrpp works by means of passive sampling that guarantees minimal disturbances of local conditions and it captures discrete data at a resolution of 20 cm providing detailed spatial information even in highly stratified systems in addition hrpp probes are direct driven allowing site assessment without the need for well installation previously the application of the hrpp has been compared to other high resolution site assessment methods including mip hpt vertically discrete 1 ft well screens and passive flux meters schneider et al 2020 in the previous study the hrpp produced comparable concentrations of contaminants and geochemical indicators and microbial abundances with respect to the vertical well screens pore velocities were comparable to passive flux meters and generally scaled with the hpt however the mip and ecd data did not correlate well with other measures of pore velocity or contaminant concentrations the use of hrpps requires two field events one for the deployment and 3 4 weeks later one for retrieval it also requires additional analysis costs based on the increased number of samples generated the hrpp is limited to locations conducive to direct drive technologies and generally shallow 30 40 ft bgs contaminated zones this study highlights the use of high resolution data produced by the hrpp to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of a biowall to remediate tce contaminated groundwater biowalls are trenches filled with bulk organic matter e g mulch compost that slowly decomposes to produce substrates e g fatty acids hydrogen that support the anaerobic biodegradation of contaminants including chlorinated solvents as groundwater migrates through the wall faisal et al 2018 obiri nyarko et al 2014 wilkin et al 2014 vogan et al 1999 walker jr et al 2020 in this case the most common degradation path is the microbial use of tce as electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration termed dehalorespiration the initial product is cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce which is terminal for a number of dehalorespiring organisms however other species can dehalogenate tce to cis dce and then further to vinyl chloride vc and finally to non toxic ethene c2h4 with dehalococcoides mccartyi being the most widely studied but a specific strain of dehalogenimonas also shows this activity löffler et al 2013 yang et al 2017 tce can also be oxidized cometabolically by various monooxygenases including soluble methane monooxygenase smmo and various toluene monooxygenases among others frascari et al 2015 in addition chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs can undergo abiotic degradation through the reduction by zero valent metals and sulfide minerals he et al 2015 whiting et al 2014 tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 the biowall that was the subject of this study was installed in 2013 in beltsville maryland usa niño de guzmán et al 2018a and has been monitored through traditional gwmws this field study which occurred in 2019 consisted of the deployment of hrpps at five locations to gather groundwater information hydraulically upgradient within and downgradient of the biowall the data from hrpps was compared to that from previously installed gwmws the parameters that were collected and analyzed included conservative ions cl br geochemical indicators fe2 so4 2 ch4 contaminant and daughter product concentrations tce cis dce vc and c2h4 stable isotope ratios of carbon in tce and cis dce δ13c pore water velocity and quantities and types of relevant dehalogenating bacteria genes as well as numerous other microbial types in the aquifer qpcr while previous work schneider et al 2020 was focused on demonstrating that the hrpp produces data comparable or superior to other high resolution methods here we focus on how the use of high resolution data from the hrpps impacts site characterization and biowall performance assessment this work demonstrates the importance of comprehensive high resolution sampling to evaluate highly variable contaminant transport with depth 2 materials and methods 2 1 technology overview the hrpp is a direct push passive sampler that enables the measurement

direct drive devices e g geoprobe fig 1 each hrpp segment consists of five consecutive and identical 21 cm 8 25 in long sampling segments with three types of sampling cells designed to enable the measurement of the aforementioned parameters the hrpps are designed to be connected together vertically in strings to collect monitoring data over longer depth intervals i e three hrpps can be connected top to bottom to monitor a 3 6 m 12 ft depth details of hrpp design theory field application and sampling have been previously described schneider et al 2020 schneider et al 2019 and are only summarized herein compared to the hrpp devices introduced previously schneider et al 2020 the model in this study has small changes in the design of cover plates and micro biotraps that make them easier to pre assemble 2 1 1 measurement of dissolved species in pore water dissolved species are measured using equilibrium diffusion sampling cleveland et al 2017 teasdale et al 1995 a sample cell 10 ml equilibrium cell in fig 1 is filled with ultra pure water spiked with sodium or potassium bromide br at 250 mg l the cell is covered with a microporous 0 45 μm opening nylon membrane sterlitech kent wa and two meshes for protection 10 μm opening nylon mesh component supply sparta tn and 630 μm opening 316 stainless steel mesh g bopp co ag westminster co dissolved species in pore water diffuse across the membrane into the sample cell due to concentration gradients the cell specific surface area ssa i e area for mass transfer divided by cell volume is sufficient to nominally allow the content of the reservoir to reach at least 90 equilibrium in 3 weeks webster et al 1998 the br in the sample cell is a conservative tracer which is used to determine the extent of equilibration based on the remaining concentration at the time of retrieval in cases where the content of the sample cell is far from equilibrium concentration of other species can be adjusted based on br results for a full discussion of the general theory of diffusion equilibrium sampling see webster et al 1998 and for the hrpp specifically see schneider et al 2020 schneider et al 2019 2 1 2 measurement of pore water velocity pore water velocity is measured using an established relationship between the mass transfer coefficient for br exiting the velocity cells and the average pore water velocity schneider et al 2019 the velocity cells fig 1 consist of a set of four reservoirs with different ssa based on varying the volume of the cell and or the cell opening since the concentration of the tracer in pore water is negligible 0 5 mg l compared to the initial concentration in velocity cells a mass balance for br in the reservoir yields 1 c t c 0 exp kat v where c t and c 0 are the concentrations of tracer at the end and the beginning of deployment respectively k is the overall mass transfer coefficient between the reservoir and pore water a v is the ssa and t is the deployment time based on the four different ssa for a set of velocity cells it is possible with a single deployment to obtain four different c t c 0 values that are used to find the mass transfer coefficient k through non linear regression once k is known it can be related to the corresponding pore water velocity u according to equation 2 k k m l 0 l exp k m 2 x u d αu erfc k m x u d αu dx where the numerical values of the parameters were obtained from previous experimental data and are presented here k m is the mass transfer coefficient of br across all layers of membrane and meshes 3 22 cm d d is the effective diffusion coefficient of br in pore water that is already corrected for porosity and tortuosity 0 21 cm2 d α is the dispersivity of the media estimated to be 0 2 mm and l is the characteristic length of the hrpp cell window in the direction of advection 1 cm for a full discussion on this method to estimate pore water velocity see schneider et al 2019 2 1 3 measurement of microbial populations microbial population composition and abundance are measured using bio sep beads placed in shallow cells micro biotraps fig 1 and covered by 630 μm opening 316 stainless steel mesh g bopp co ag westminster co the cells have a 1 3 cm diameter hole drilled completely through the hrpp to allow groundwater flow through the beads fig 1 and facilitate bacterial adhesion ahad et al 2018 rege et al 1998 at retrieval the beads are removed from the hrpp rinsed in sterile phosphate buffered saline solution and shipped on ice for quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr analysis of select organisms and genes in this case the beads were analyzed for key dehalogenating microorganisms e g dehalococcoides dehalogenimonas dehalobacter and desulfitobacterium and genes vinyl chloride reductase vcra bav1 vinyl chloride reductase bvca and tce reductase tcea involved in the reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes organisms and genes capable of aerobic cometabolism of tce and other cvocs were also measured e g total methanotrophs and smmo as were specific classes of anaerobes including sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens the microbial and gene analyses were conducted by microbial insights inc knoxville tn according to the qpcr method quantarray chlor this method consists of the dna extraction followed by qpcr of the genes of interest conducted using a quantstudio 12 k flex real time prc system applied biosystems grand island ny all qpcr analyses include extraction blanks and appropriate negative no dna and positive control reactions for each analysis except those for smmo total methanogens and total eutrophic bacteria data are reported in cells ml or cells bead for bio sep beads with the assumption that there is one gene copy per cell for smmo the assumption is 2 gene copies per cell for methanogens 3 5 gene copies per cell and total eutrophic bacteria 3 6 gene copies per cell ali et al 2006 baldwin et al 2008 primer sets for qpcr analyses for aromatic oxygenases toluene dioxygenase tod phenol hydrolase phe toluene monooxygenase rmo and toluene monooxygenase 2 rdeg are provided in baldwin et al 2003 the previous designations represent specific primers designed to detect numerous genotypes dehalobacter dcm employs a primer set for dehalobacter spp known to biodegrade dichloromethane grostern et al 2010 justicia leon et al 2012 2 1 4 measurement of cvoc transformation cvoc transformation is evaluated by csia wanner et al 2016 chiang et al 2012 hunkeler et al 2008 this technique relies on the fact that molecules containing a heavy isotope of an element e g tce with 13c are degraded more slowly than those with only light isotopes this fact typically results in an isotopic enrichment in the parent molecule with time known as a kinetic isotope effect which can be estimated by measuring delta δ values of elements in the parent compound over time in this case δ13c was measured for chlorinated ethenes present at each location csia was conducted by extracting chlorinated ethenes accumulated on the bio sep beads in the hrpps but when concentrations are sufficient the technique can be conducted using compounds collected in equilibrated pore water in the hrpp as well csia analysis was performed by microbial insights inc knoxville tn for this analysis target analytes are separated by gas chromatography and combusted to co2 that is then analyzed via isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms the isotope ratios are anchored to a reference co2 gas and the δ13c values are calculated 2 2 site background the site is located in the beltsville agricultural research center barc in maryland usa and belongs to the areas of concern aoc designated for environmental investigations and remediation see fig c 1 in si part c aoc barc 27 consists of the beaver dam road landfill located next to the beaver dam rd between research rd and bio control rd on the north bank of beaverdam creek from the 1940s to 1980s the site operated as a capped rubble landfill usda ars 2012 in 1998 a plume of contaminated groundwater coming from the landfill was identified with a concentration of tce around two orders of magnitude higher than the maximum contaminant level mcl of 0 005 mg l in drinking water us epa 2009 bmt designers and planners 2011 further investigations were conducted at the site under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla to characterize the area a feasibility study was developed to identify potential remedies to be applied at the site including a biowall bmt designers and planners 2008 in 2011 usda ars in conjunction with the united states environmental protection agency us epa and bmt designers and planners selected the implementation of a biowall as the preferred remedy for the site bmt designers and planners 2011 in july 2013 the biowall was installed south of the former landfill in the direction of groundwater flow and the final dimensions were approximately 305 m long 5 5 to 7 m deep and 0 7 m wide the composition of the biowall by volume was 40 mulch 30 compost and 30 sand as stabilizing material based on gwmw sampling results within and downgradient of the barrier in 2014 and 2017 the biowall resulted in the complete removal of tce from the groundwater plume but with accumulation of cis dce as a daughter product bmt designers and planners 2015 bmt designers and planners 2018 one of the objectives of using the hrpp technology was to provide a better understanding of geochemical microbiological or transport issues impacting the biowall performance more details of the site and the implemented biowall can be found in previous documents niño de guzmán et al 2018a bmt designers and planners 2011

11 hrpp devices were installed at five locations along a groundwater transect generally in the direction of groundwater flow from a high concentration area across the biowall towards a tributary to beaverdam creek see fig 2 at three locations a string of three hrpp segments 3 6 m was deployed next 0 9 m to gwmws see fig 2 an additional single hrpp segment 1 2 m was installed dg 1 between the biowall and well mw 10 while the last hrpp 1 2 m was installed into the deposition bank of one of the meanders of the unnamed tributary to the beaverdam creek details of depths at which hrpps were installed and screen intervals of the nearby wells are presented in fig 2 and listed in table c 1 in supplemental information si for installation pre cleaned soap water di water and methanol hrpps were assembled in the field for assembling samplers were submerged in a solution of distilled water and sodium bromide 250 mg br l sigma aldrich st louis mo equilibrium and velocity cells were covered with membrane and meshes which are held in place with cover plates attached using 316 stainless steel screws see section 2 1 and fig 1 micro biotraps were filled with sterile bio sep beads and covered with a layer of stainless steel mesh and a small cover plate screwed to the hrpp body further details of the assembly can be found in schneider et al 2020 between march 6 and 8 2019 the hrpp devices were deployed using a geoprobe track mounted direct push technology dpt rig before insertion cores were taken to visually identify formation characteristics see si part d in addition a commercial bio trap microbial insights knoxville tn was placed at mid screen interval in wells mw 6 and bw 6 for analysis of microbial populations and csia of cvocs four weeks later between april 2 and 3 hrpp devices were retrieved with the dpt rig each sampler s surface was wiped clean and blotted dry with kimwipes water from the equilibrium and velocity cells was removed using a glass gas tight syringe hamilton reno nv and a sterile needle 18 gauge from each of the duplicate equilibrium cells at each depth 5 ml was added to an amber glass vial containing 0 1 ml 1 1 hydrochloric acid preservative and capped with a teflon lined lid there was no headspace and sample bottles were filled from the bottom to minimize turbulence and prevent entrapment of bubbles vials were driven on ice to aptim s

dissolved gases and epa method 8260 purge and trap with analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms for cvocs a second aliquot of the groundwater from the duplicate equilibrium cells was placed in sterile 15 ml polypropylene vials and shipped on ice to texas tech university lubbock tx for analysis of inorganic anions cl br no3 and so4 2 by ion chromatography ic according to epa method 300 1 a third aliquot 1 ml of the groundwater from each equilibrium cell was tested for dissolved iron fe2 onsite immediately after sample collection to avoid oxidation of fe2 to fe3 analysis was performed using a portable spectrophotometer hach dr1900 hach company loveland co following the 1 10 phenanthroline method hach method 8146 the solution from each velocity cell was collected using a syringe and needle and placed into plastic screw cap vials for analysis of br according to epa method 300 1 at texas tech university lubbock tx bio sep beads were removed from the hrpp using an ethanol sterilized stainless steel spatula beads were placed on a stainless steel strainer and were gently rinsed with sterile phosphate buffered saline solution cold spring harbor 2006 bio sep beads were placed in sterile falcon tubes becton dickinson franklin lakes nj and stored on ice a subset of the falcon tubes were shipped on ice overnight to microbial insights knoxville tn for csia and qpcr analysis bio trap devices retrieved from wells were shipped for analysis with the bio sep beads collected from the hrpps at retrieval of the hrpps gwmws next to hrpp locations were sampled using low flow sampling puls and barcelona 1996 field parameters ph temperature dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential and conductivity were measured during sample collection using an ysi 6920 water quality meter ysi inc yellow springs oh groundwater samples were collected for analysis of fe2 dissolved gases cvocs and inorganic anions and treated identically to those from the hrpps i e stored and shipped on ice and analyzed together with hrpp samples using the same methods 2 4 calculations the extent of equilibration between equilibrium cells and pore water was estimated based on the remaining concentration of br at retrieval using the equation 3 f ss 1 c t c 0 where f ss is the fraction of steady state and c t and c 0 mg l are concentrations of br in equilibrium cell at retrieval and deployment respectively no br was detected 0 5 mg l in groundwater from wells so c t 0 at t for hrpp cells not in equilibrium with groundwater f ss 1 concentrations of environmental species in pore water gases chlorinated ethenes ferrous iron and anions were estimated from 4 c c s f ss where c and c s are concentration of dissolved species in groundwater and the hrpp cell respectively see si

velocity cells the overall mass transfer coefficient was estimated from eq 1 the coefficient k was obtained through non linear regression with the function nlinfit m and confidence intervals were estimated with the function nlparci m of matlab mathworks natick ma pore water velocity was estimated from relationship eq 2 for k and u schneider et al 2019 3 results figs 3 through 8 present the results from the hrpps well water and bio traps at locations where gwmws are present there are two figures per location the first contains data related to chemical species and transport indicators and the second presents microbial abundances the former contains four panels the first two are related to cvocs water concentrations and stable isotope values δ13c the third has information on geochemistry and the fourth shows velocity estimations extent of equilibration in hrpp cells and concentration of cl the second figure has four panels the first two contain information on microbial populations and the remaining ones have data on specific functional genes capable of reductive dechlorination each figure contains three types of symbols vertical lines for results from well water spanned over the screening interval filled markers for hrpp results and unfilled markers for data from bio traps deployed in selected gwmws both figures contain a column to show the stratigraphy of the location with abbreviations from the unified soil classification system uscs details on stratigraphy for each location can be found in core logs in si part d depths are in reference to a common datum which corresponds to the ground surface in the biowall area see fig 2 3 1 location mw 6 mw 6 is a gwmw 20 m hydraulically upgradient of the biowall with a screening interval between 2 4 and 8 5 m below common datum bcd fig 2 groundwater was sampled at a depth of 3 0 m bcd and a bio trap was installed at the same depth next to the well 0 9 m a 3 6 m hrpp string was deployed which sampled pore water from 1 0 to 4 2 m bcd fig 2 based on visual observations of cores retrieved before deployment of the hrpp surface layers 3 5 m bcd consisted of layers of silt silt clay sand fine sand and silt clay to 3 5 m bcd below this depth there was gray silt and clay with trace fine sand and a uniform red clay layer layers ml and cl below 3 5 m in stratigraphy in fig 3 see also si part d figs 3 and 4 present a summary of data from the gwmw and the respective hrpp 3 1 1 cvocs in the monitoring well tce was present at 430 μg l minimum reporting limit mrl 12 μg l but cis dce mrl 9 μg l and vc mrl 18 μg l were not detected fig 3 the final daughter product of full dechlorination c2h4 mrl 5 μg l was not detected in the gwmw tce was detected in pore water at all depths sampled by the hrpp concentrations of tce increased with depth from 15 to 900 μg l and a rapid increase in concentration occurred between 3 0 and 3 5 m bcd the depth where clay started to appear in the core fig 3 cis dce was also measured in the hrpp cells at depths between 1 0 and 2 5 m bcd with a peak concentration of 150 μg l c2h4 was measured at low concentrations 20 μg l below 2 0 m bcd the stable isotope composition of c in tce δ13c 23 was identical for water sampled from the gwmw and the bio trap deployed in mw 6 fig 3 measurements of δ13c for tce in hrpp micro biotraps varied with depth ranging between 18 and 23 at the lowest sampled hrpp depth water from one of the equilibrium cells was also analyzed for δ13c in tce the δ13c value of tce collected from the hrpp equilibrated water sample and from bio sep beads in the micro biotraps were similar 19 9 and 21 5 respectively and within the range of other hrpp micro biotraps gwmw water and in well bio trap values the similarity of values suggests that sorption to the beads does not appreciably fractionate the tce the stable isotope composition on c in cis dce δ13c 26 was measurable at three depths which corresponded to the presence of cis dce measured in equilibrium cells around 2 0 m bcd the δ13c values of tce suggest uniform fractionation of tce with depth based on lower values compared to untransformed tce 33 5 to 24 5 hunkeler et al 2008 mcloughlin et al 2014 the cis dce δ13c values measured by the hrpp were depleted in 13c compared to the co occurring tce indicating that cis dce is a degradation product of tce in this plume as expected 3 1 2 geochemistry well water from mw 6 was oxic do 3 5 mg l had a positive orp 186 mv and ph of 4 8 in well water the concentration of so4 2 was 165 mg l fe2 was 7 2 mg l ch4 was 45 μg l and cl was 71 mg l fig 3 in equilibrated water from hrpp cells so4 2 concentrations increased from 60 to 150 mg l from 1 0 to 1 5 m bcd below which they remained relatively stable 150 mg l until a depth of 3 5 m bcd at which point so4 2 rapidly decreased with increasing depth fe2 concentrations in hrpp samples generally increased with depth 25 to 85 mg l dissolved ch4 in hrpp samples increased from 40 to 200 μg l with depth cl in pore water also increased with depth from 50 to 78 mg l depths below 3 5 m bcd appear to be more reducing based on increases in ch4 and reduction in so4 2 concentrations depths above 3 5 m seem to be dominated by fe reduction discrepancies in measured concentrations of fe2 between well water and hrpp samples may be due to oxidation in the well casing due to the presence of o2 from the possible mixing of aerobic and anaerobic groundwater ch4 so4 2 and cl concentrations between well water and hrpp samples were reasonably similar taking into account the dependence of concentrations on depth 3 1 3 velocity estimates and extent of equilibration pore water velocity estimates were between 2 and 7 cm d pore velocities were highest above 2 5 m bcd fig 3 this observation is consistent with expected conductivities of aquifer solid materials observed in retrieved cores around this depth fine to medium sand in addition the relative extent of equilibration in cells based on remaining br in equilibrium cells supports a low rate of mass transfer below 3 5 m bcd reflecting low permeability layers gray silt and clay see si part d 3 1 4 microbial populations and key functional genes fig 4 compares microbial abundances obtained from hrpp micro biotraps filled markers a commercial bio trap deployed in mw 6 unfilled markers and water from the well vertical lines in well water only two types of bacteria were quantifiable above detection limits sulfate reducers and dehalococcoides spp excluding total eubacteria the in well bio trap detected sulfate reducers but no dehalogenating organisms or other measured bacterial genes species or groups in both well water and the in well bio trap only one cometabolic gene toluene dioxygenase was detected in contrast using hrpp micro biotraps the presence at relatively high abundances of not only the species detected in well water but also the dehalogenating bacteria desulfuromonas spp dehalobacter spp and dehalobium chlorocoercia were detected hrpp micro biotraps also measured a number of co metabolic genes but none consistently with depth 3 1 5 summary and discussion based on both data from the hrpp and well water tce is the dominant cvoc at this hydraulically upgradient location based upon hrpp data the tce concentration was highest near the lower clay layer which corresponds to the lowest pore velocities and most reduced conditions based on the detection of reduced so4 2 presumably due to biological sulfate reduction and increased ch4 concentrations likely from methanogenesis at depths above the clay layer hrpp data show decreasing tce concentrations towards the surface with cis dce increasing to approximately equal concentrations as tce it should be noted that cis dce was not detected in groundwater collected from mw 6 the upper zone of the aquifer also was characterized by higher pore water velocities based upon hrpp data δ13c analysis shows that tce is similarly fractionated across all depths with the detected cis dce likely being the terminal product of the transformation process as there is no evidence of further dechlorination of cis dce with the available data it is unclear why cis dce was only observed in the upper section of the sampled area concentrations of tce so4 2 and cl were similar for gwmw and hrpp samples taking into account the depth 3 0 m bcd at which the well was sampled however the interpretation of the biogeochemistry as well as the fate and transport of tce is quite different between the two methods based on gwmw data there is no evidence of the higher cvoc concentration in the lower clay unit presence of cis dce evidence of partial reductive dehalogenation or the higher mass flux at depths above 2 5 m bcd in addition the geochemistry appears more oxic in the gwmw sample than many of the deeper hrpp samples and several bacterial genera capable of reducing tce desulfuromonas dehalobacter dehalobium were only detected using the hrpp not in well water or on in well bio traps the presence of these genera but not dehalococcoides or dehalogenimonas is consistent with the partial dechlorination of tce to cis dce as among these organisms only dehalococcoides and one known species of dehalogenimonas can transform tce completely to c2h4 löffler et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the consistent presence of these dehalogenating organisms in the micro biotraps but not on the groundwater samples or the commercial bio trap is also important in that it suggests that close proximity of the hrpp to the sediments may yield a more accurate assessment of the indigenous microbial community than either groundwater alone or beads suspended in groundwater within a well bore thus in this location the hrpp provided a much more detailed assessment of geochemical microbiological and contaminant conditions than sampling the existing gwmw 3 2 location bw 6 gwmw bw 6 is located within the biowall which spans from 0 5 to 5 8 m bcd with a screening interval from 1 4 to 6 0 m bcd fig 2 a bio trap was installed at 3 3 m bcd at the same depth from which gwmw was sampled next to the well 0 9 m a 3 6 m hrpp string was deployed which sampled pore water at depths from 1 6 to 4 8 m bcd fig 2 3 2 1 cvocs in the monitoring well cvocs were detected tce 21 μg l cis dce 131 μg l and vc 26 μg l with trace concentrations of c2h4 10 μg l fig 5 using the hrpp tce was not detected in pore water and cis dce and vc were detected only between 3 0 and 3 6 m bcd with peak concentrations of 95 and 64 μg l for cis dce and vc respectively measurable concentrations of c2h4 were found below 2 5 m bcd with peak concentrations 60 μg l occurring at similar depth 3 0 to 3 5 m bcd as cvocs the δ13c values for tce and cis dce present in groundwater from the gwmw or adsorbed to beads within the in well bio trap were similar between the two sampling methods but the δ13c values for tce 15 were much more positive than cis dce values 21 fig 5 the very positive i e highly enriched values of δ13c in tce combined with the much reduced concentrations compared to upgradient well mw 6 are consistent with significant reductive biotransformation of tce occurring in the biowall interestingly the cis dce δ13c values 21 were very similar to those in upgradient well mw 6 the csia data indicate appreciable conversion of tce to cis dce but little further degradation of cis dce the low concentration of vc with respect to cis dce in well bw 6 supports this analysis in the hrpps δ13c values were measurable only for cis dce and only for depths corresponding to the two highest concentrations 3 3 m bcd the δ13c values ranged from 8 to 4 showing significant c isotope fractionation compared to the bulk water or bio trap cis dce samples the hrpp data suggest that cis dce is degrading within the mulch biowall and that the bulk groundwater collected from the well including that in the vicinity of the suspended bio trap consists predominantly of that from zone s where cis dce is not being transformed 3 2 2 geochemistry well water from bw 6 was anoxic based on orp 55 mv and had a ph of 6 3 the do could not be determined due to interferences from the high concentration of doc from the biowall concentrations of so4 2 fe2 ch4 and cl in well water were 140 mg l 50 mg l 14 000 μg l and 67 mg l respectively fig 5 pore water concentrations measured using the hrpp were variable with depth concentrations of so4 2 were very low 1 5 mg l at all depths except for two depths between 3 0 to 3 5 m bcd high velocity zone where a concentration of 55 mg l was detected elevated concentrations of fe2 50 120 mg l were measured for all depths with highest concentrations at shallower depths and the lowest concentration 50 mg l at 3 3 m bcd ch4 was also measured throughout the sampled depth at concentrations between 4000 and 25 000 μg l with concentrations generally increasing with depth concentrations of cl were between 13 and 59 mg l with a defined peak in the profile at 3 0 m bcd both gwmw and hrpp samples support highly reducing conditions within the biowall compared to the upgradient mw 6 location geochemical indicators do not generally agree when considering average hrpp concentrations and those from the gwmw however if only the concentrations of geochemical indicators at depths between 3 0 and 3 5 m bcd are compared the values are more similar this observation is also true for concentrations of cl chloride concentration peaks at 3 2 m bcd and is very similar to the measured well concentration 59 and 66 mg l respectively while concentrations at lower and higher depths are much lower 3 2 3 velocity estimates and extent of equilibration estimations of pore water velocity were generally 5 cm d at all depths except between 3 0 and 3 5 m bcd where velocities increased to 10 40 cm d suggesting the biowall intersects a high permeability zone in the native soil the extents of equilibration f ss values were relatively uniform 90 with slightly higher values 100 around 3 4 m bcd similar f ss values provide indication of uniform permeability that reflects homogeneity of the barrier filling materials this observation suggests that the biowall has maintained its permeability and it has not affected the groundwater flow pattern in the original formation which is in line with observations in other studies walker jr et al 2020 shen et al 2012 3 2 4 microbial populations and key functional genes location bw 6 showed a diversity of organisms genes linked to reductive dehalogenation as well as aerobic cometabolism of cvocs there were a few more genera genes detected in water samples from the gwmw than the in well bio trap however all genera genes measured in well water were also measurable using the hrpp micro biotraps hrpp samples from five out of six analyzed depths showed detectable sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens with the former typically being 1 3 orders of magnitude more prevalent than the latter this fact was consistent with the low concentrations of so4 2 and high concentrations of ch4 in pore water in addition all cvoc reducing genera analyzed by this qpcr method desulfitobacterium desulfuromonas dehalococcoides dehalobacter dehalogenimonas and dehalobium were detected using the hrpp micro biotraps and in water collected from the gwmw the in well bio trap only detected three of these genera tce and vc reductase genes tcea and vcra were detected by all three sampling techniques several co metabolic genes were also consistently detected with depth and between sampling methods including smmo toluene monooxygenases and phenol hydroxylase this shows the co occurrence of organisms genes capable of anaerobic reductive dehalogenation and aerobic cometabolism of cvocs in the same environment 3 2 5 summary and discussion using data generated from gwmw samples and the hrpp the biowall is more reducing than the hydraulically upgradient location mw 6 and is promoting reductive dehalogenation of tce based on reduced concentration compared to upgradient samples and δ13c values abundances of species capable of anaerobically biotransforming tce suggest that main degradation path is biotic but the possibility of abiotic transformation is not discarded given the elevated levels of fe2 whiting et al 2014 dong et al 2009 there are several important factors that would not be revealed by evaluation of well water samples alone first based on bulk well water data it would appear that tce degradation is incomplete throughout the biowall the cis dce concentration is higher than vc tce is still detected albeit at a reduced concentration c2h4 is absent and δ13c cis dce values are similar to those from upgradient the data also suggest relatively weak reducing conditions as so4 2 remains in the water the depth dependent hrpp data suggests the biowall intersects a zone with high velocity between 3 0 and 3 5 m bcd which most likely is allowing insufficient residence time for complete reduction of tce in that specific area this hypothesis is supported by past studies that have measured cvocs downgradient of reactive barriers lu et al 2007 grajales mesa and malina 2019 gwmw bw 6 seems to draw water preferentially from the high velocity interval which also has higher so4 2 and lower ch4 concentrations than other depth intervals the hrpp data indicate that tce has been completely transformed to c2h4 at most depth intervals in the barrier 3 0 3 5 m bcd excluded and that conditions are highly reducing no so4 2 and high ch4 which is in line with biologically active biowalls alexander et al 2017 even in the high velocity zone the hrpp data suggest that tce degradation is much more complete than suggested by groundwater from bw 6 equal concentrations of cis dce vc and c2h4 no measurable tce and δ13c cis dce showing substantial fractionation it is possible that observations in this gwmw are reflective of water from the high velocity zone and that during pumping water was drawn from the formation outside and upgradient of the biowall resulting in the higher so4 2 lower ch4 and a less biodegraded cvoc profile i e higher tce and cis dce no c2h4 this possibility is supported by the fact that the sample was obtained from the depth where the high velocity was observed 3 3 location mw 10 gwmw mw 10 corresponds to a point 14 m downgradient of the biowall with a screening interval between 3 3 and 6 4 m bcd fig 2 no bio trap was installed because this well was 2 5 cm in diameter next to the well 0 9 m a 3 6 m hrpp string was deployed the hrpp sampled pore water from 1 9 to 5 1 m bcd fig 2 based on cores from this location soil composition consisted of sand with and without gravel and a clay layer below 4 5 m bcd layer cl in stratigraphy in fig 7 see also si part d 3 3 1 cvocs in the monitoring well cis dce was measured at 135 μg l which is similar to that within biowall well bw 6 cis dce 131 μg l no other cvocs were detected cis dce was measured in three samples from the hrpp with concentrations ranging from 23 to 45 μg l fig 7 the δ13c value of cis dce in well water from mw 10 21 4 was slightly more negative but similar to that measured in hrpp micro biotraps 18 8 and 19 the δ13c values of cis dce in the well and micro biotraps were similar to those collected from the gwmw in the biowall bw 6 21 but not from the hrpp placed in the biowall 8 to 4 which were comparatively enriched in 13c indicating additional cis dce biodegradation this could suggest that cis dce at mw 10 represents legacy cis dce downgradient of the biowall or more likely that cis dce treatment in the biowall is not uniform the reason that the concentrations of cis dce in hrpp cells at the mw 10 location were 3 to 5 fold lower than in the bulk groundwater is unclear it is possible that in spite of the lateral proximity 0 9 m the gwmw and the hrpp captured information from different soil seams since strata at this location can be highly heterogeneous given the proximity to the meanders of the unnamed tributary large differences in pore water concentrations of cvocs over small vertical and horizontal distances 0 5 m have been already observed in heterogeneous aquifers schneider et al 2020 3 3 2 geochemistry well water from mw 10 was anoxic orp of 30 mv and had a ph of 6 2 concentrations of so4 2 fe2 ch4 and cl in well water were 52 mg l 51 mg l 2750 μg l and 46 mg l respectively concentrations of so4 2 by hrpp were generally much lower than in the well 2 and 10 mg l except at a single point 2 1 m bcd where the concentration was 31 mg l fe2 in pore water ranged between 37 and 63 mg l except for one point 1 mg l highest concentrations of so4 2 fe2 ch4 and cl were found between 3 0 and 4 5 m bcd fig 7 at the shallowest depths the lower concentrations may be due to dilution with surface water concentrations of fe2 and ch4 were similar between hrpp cells at depths between 2 0 and 3 5 m bcd and gwmw water similar to mw 6 the so4 2 concentration in the gwmw was much higher than hrpp concentrations at any depth possibly suggesting oxidation of sulfide in the well or overrepresentation of less reduced groundwater from a high permeability seam gwmw water also had a slightly higher concentration of cl than any of the hrpp sampled depths 3 3 3 velocity estimates and extent of equilibration pore velocities were generally 2 cm d at all depths except near the surface 13 and 19 cm d hrpp sample cells were generally 80 equilibrated except at depths below 3 9 m bcd 60 and 80 corresponding to lower permeability material that is in line with the layer of clay observed in the core transition from sw to cl in stratigraphy in fig 7 see also si part d 3 3 4 microbial populations and key functional genes no bio trap was deployed in mw 10 because of the small diameter of the well but six hrpp micro biotraps were evaluated for microbial abundances fig 8 there were some differences noted in dehalogenating genera between gwmw water samples and hrpp micro biotraps in particular dehalogenimonas were only measured in well water and desulfitobacterium and desulfuromonas were only measured by hrpp micro biotraps abundances of detected species were highest at mid depths corresponding to the highest concentrations of so4 2 fe2 ch4 and cis dce lower levels and fewer functional genes were detected in the hrpp cells and groundwater in this zone compared to within the biowall vc reductase gene vcra was detected in only one hrpp cell and tce reductase gene tcea was not detected at all this observation suggests higher reductive dehalogenation potential within the biowall than either upgradient where no dehalogenases were detected or downgradient this is consistent with there being little change in the δ13c for cis dce in this zone compared to the biowall i e suggesting no further reductive degradation and the absence of other daughter products such as vc or c2h4 3 3 5 summary and discussion concentrations and δ13c values of cis dce in well water were comparable to those measured in the gwmw in the biowall 21 4 in mw 10 vs 21 5 in bw 6 suggesting little degradation occurred downgradient of the barrier the lower concentrations of cis dce at hrpp samples but similar δ13c values are unexplained but perhaps are due to a higher conductivity layer intersected by the well but not the hrpp this location is within the flood zone of the unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek and flow paths may be highly chaotic given historical meanderings of the tributary and likely alteration of flow path along the stream channel 3 4 locations without monitoring wells in addition to locations mw 6 bw 6 and mw 10 where monitoring wells are present two separate hrpps were deployed at locations dg 1 between bw 6 and mw 10 and downgradient from mw 10 within the unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek see fig 2 results for these locations are presented in figs c 2 through c 5 in si 3 4 1 dg 1 at dg 1 tce was detected at one depth at a concentration of 26 μg l and cis dce was measured at all five depths at values between 19 and 51 μg l concentrations of cis dce are similar to those captured downstream by the hrpp installed in location mw 10 interestingly tce was not detected in any of the hrpp cells or in well water from the mw 10 location concentrations varied for so4 2 from 18 to 107 mg l for fe2 from 81 to 125 mg l and for ch4 from 1900 to 4300 μg l the highest value of so4 2 is not consistent with neighbor locations where concentrations were lower high concentrations of fe2 are similar to those in the biowall and ch4 values are closer to the ones observed in mw 10 in the case of cl concentrations are uniform around 30 mg l and are similar to the highest concentration values observed in mw 10 at this location a high velocity 33 cm d was measured only at 2 5 m bcd where the highest extent of equilibration 98 was found these values again suggest a highly permeable layer in the top part of the sampled area this layer is in line with the distinctive intervals in locations bw 6 and mw 10 where high velocity was observed this is also the zone where tce was detected in the two selected depths for analysis of organisms capable of reductive dehalogenation desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and dehalobium were detected at low densities but vc reductase genes bvca and vcra and the tce reductase gene tcea were not present as noted for the downgradient location mw 10 this indicates a low potential for continuing reductive dehalogenation in this region of the local aquifer 3 4 2 unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek stream one hrpp segment was installed within the unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek stream channel at this location the only measured cvoc was cis dce at the deepest sampled depth 3 3 m bcd with a concentration of 17 μg l which is in the same depth where cis dce was observed in the hrpp at location mw 10 3 2 m bcd concentrations of so4 2 were between 9 and 27 mg l fe2 between 47 and 63 mg l and ch4 between 300 to 2500 μg l the concentration of cl was 15 mg l but increased to 30 mg l at the lowest sampled depth values of these geochemical parameters are similar to the ones observed by hrpp in mw 10 the profile of pore water velocity shows a well defined peak at 3 0 m bcd with a maximum of 22 cm d in general f ss values are closer to 100 indicating a region of very high permeability dehalogenating bacteria dehalobacter dehalobium and dehalococcoides were detected in one or more of the hrpp cells but none of the relevant dehalogenase genes were present 3 5 impact of sampling technique on site evaluation regardless of sampling technique hrpp or gwmw some gross observations were similar as illustrated by comparing gwmw data to hrpp averaged or maximum depth discrete data for each location fig c 8 in si there was a general reduction of cvocs across the site supported by δ13c values that indicate extensive conversion of tce to cis dce the most reducing conditions occurred in the biowall based on geochemical indicators e g so4 2 ch4 and fe2 as well as highest measured abundances and diversity of bacteria genes capable of reductive dechlorination figs c 6 and c 7 in si the concentration and site distribution of species that vary little with depth e g cl were also similar however numerous critical differences in the distribution fate and transport of cvocs are evident when using the high resolution hrpp data compared to gwmw data at location mw 6 tce concentration increases appreciably with depth and peak concentrations are 2 higher than in well water further tce is present in highest concentration near the clay layer present below 3 0 m bcd this would suggest that the clay may act as a long term source of tce to hydraulically downgradient areas muskus and falta 2018 muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 seyedabbasi et al 2012 in addition cis dce is present at shallower depths which is not indicated from well data estimates of groundwater velocities across the site based on slug pumping and tracer tests between 2 3 and 4 4 cm d in the vicinity of bw 6 bmt designers and planners 2017 match generally with hrpp measured velocities see fig 9 however the hrpp measured a zone of high pore water velocity 40 cm d present at 3 0 to 3 5 m bcd in the biowall in the biowall bw 6 using high resolution data cvocs are only present over a narrow depth range 3 0 to 3 5 m bcd and include reduced daughter products from tce beyond cis dce i e vc and c2h4 based only on gwmw data it would appear that cis dce is present over the whole biowall depth and there is little evidence of more reduced daughter products the presence of cvocs in the high velocity zone would be consistent with shorter residence times that have been observed in small areas of biowalls shen et al 2012 the differences in cvoc concentrations with depth and estimated groundwater velocities using gwmw or hrpp would lead to differences in estimated fluxes through the biowall and subsequent conclusions about its efficacy fluxes of cvocs in bw 6 based on gwmw data are 210 μg m2d for tce 1310 μg m2d for cis dce and 260 μg m2d for vc see si part b for calculations on the other hand based on hrpp data there was no estimated flux for tce and fluxes for the other cvocs are 840 μg m2d for cis dce and 620 μg m2d for vc see si part b based on gwmw data alone it would appear that the biowall is not performing well with only partial transformation of tce to cis dce and breakthrough across the entire depth of the biowall in contrast based on hrpp data the biowall appears to be performing as intended with partial breakthrough only occurring in the narrow zone of high velocity these differences in biowall assessment would extend to geochemical indicators based on hrpp data so4 2 is only present in the biowall in the high velocity zone where concomitantly ch4 is at a minimum while other depths have elevated concentrations this is consistent with complete dechlorination of tce at depths with low velocity and partial dechlorination in the high velocity zone due to the shorter retention time however based on gwmw data so4 2 is only slightly reduced compared to upgradient locations supporting incomplete cvoc transformation finally this difference in interpretation persists downgradient gwmw data from downgradient well mw 10 supports breakthrough of the biowall with cis dce concentrations similar to the biowall 130 μg l in contrast hrpp data for mw 10 suggest only sporadic presence of cis dce with depth this difference in concentration distribution results in differences of estimated mass fluxes for cis dce at this location 1355 μg m2d from gwmw data and 14 μg m2d from hrpp data see si part b using the gwmw data versus the hrpp data results in substantially different site assessments as illustrated by fig 10 based on the hrpp data cvocs are present upgradient of the biowall location mw 6 where tce concentrations are greatest in the lower less permeable zone and cis dce is present at low concentration in depths closer to the surface the biowall is completely transforming cvocs except in a narrow zone with high velocity in which transformation of tce is complete but cis dce transformation is incomplete high velocity zones continue downgradient but concentrations of cvocs occur only sporadically see fig 9 data also suggests that cvocs are not surfacing into the stream this contrasts to any assessment based on gwmw data alone in this case tce is present upgradient of the biowall but no information is available on depth dependent concentrations and no cis dce is present degradation occurs in the biowall but is incomplete with cis dce apparently present throughout the biowall depth downgradient mw 10 cis dce is present and it seems to migrate towards the stream 4 conclusion the results of this study support the need for high resolution sampling to understand the impact of heterogeneous formations with highly variable transport properties previously we have demonstrated that in source zones concentrations of cvocs can vary by orders of magnitude over short intervals 0 5 m and that peak concentrations are directly related to low permeability layers schneider et al 2020 here we again demonstrate that there can be substantial variations in distribution and flux of cvocs with depth that are only measurable using high resolution sampling although overall observations from hrpps and gwmws were grossly consistent if one averages the depth dependent data from the hrpps based on the high resolution data there were several important findings which were not discoverable using data from the gwmws at this location data from the hrpps indicate that cvocs are mainly transported within narrow intervals with high velocity the biowall was completely transforming tce to c2h4 except within the high velocity zone where the concentrations were reduced but breakthrough of cis dce was apparent hydraulically upgradient of the biowall concentrations of tce increased with depth where a low permeability zone exists that will likely remain as a long term source in addition although low concentrations of cis dce were present downgradient of the barrier surfacing into a downgradient stream unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek was not detected based on gwmws only the flux of tce and resultant cis dce would be overestimated the persistence of the tce plume would be underestimated and additional remedial actions could fail due to the previously unidentified high velocity layers thus this study demonstrates the utility of high resolution sampling to both characterize and to provide continuous monitoring of contaminated aquifers the hrpp sampling was able to capture the depth dependent heterogeneities in transport and transformation and enables more detailed conceptual models of the site that impact overall assessment of the biowall performance use of high resolution sampling would also better enable initial site assessments and subsequent remedial designs allowing better placement and understanding of required screen

1330,this study contrasts the use of high resolution passive sampling and traditional groundwater monitoring wells gwmw to characterize a chlorinated solvent site and assess the effectiveness of a biowall mulch compost and sand that was installed to remediate trichloroethene tce the primary contaminant of concern high resolution passive profilers hrpps were direct driven hydraulically upgradient within and hydraulically downgradient of the biowall and in close proximity to existing gwmws compared with hydraulically upgradient locations the biowall was highly reducing there were higher densities of bacteria genes capable of reductive dechlorination and tce was being reductively transformed but not completely as cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce was detected within and hydraulically downgradient of the biowall however based on the high resolution data there were a number of important findings which were not discoverable using data from gwmws alone data from the hrpps indicate that the biowall was completely transforming tce to ethene c2h4 except within a high velocity interval where the concentrations were reduced but breakthrough of cis dce was apparent hydraulically upgradient of the biowall concentrations of tce increased with depth where a very low permeability zone exists that will likely remain as a long term source in addition although low concentrations of cis dce were present downgradient of the biowall surfacing into a downgradient stream was not detected this study demonstrates the advantages of high resolution passive sampling of aquifers to assess the performance of remediation techniques compared to traditional methods such as gwmws keywords chlorinated solvents passive sampling biowall pore water velocity csia biodegradation 1 introduction trichloroethene tce and other chlorinated solvents are common contaminants in groundwater systems worldwide huang et al 2019 jin et al 2020 due to the toxicity and carcinogenic nature of tce buhagen et al 2016 chiu et al 2013 numerous biotic and abiotic technologies have been implemented to remediate impacted sites technologies include pump and treat systems in situ chemical oxidation reduction and enhancement of microbial activity through modification of site conditions nunez garcia et al 2020 qian et al 2020 hyldegaard et al 2019 li et al 2019 bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 němeček et al 2016 niño de guzmán et al 2018a yang et al 2018 wu et al 2015 to assess the effectiveness of remediation approaches for sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents it is necessary to collect reliable information on the spatial distribution of the contaminants geochemical conditions chemical and biological transformations microbial community abundances and transport processes generally information on the distribution of contaminants and geochemistry is obtained through groundwater monitoring wells gwmws soil cores and or direct drive devices such membrane interface probes mips on the other hand magnitude and relevance of transport processes such as darcy s flux and dispersion are estimated from hydraulic gradients and conductivities measured in soil cores or through hydraulic profiling tools hpts gwmws the most common monitoring technology tend to overrepresent water from highly permeable strata in heterogeneous soils particularly for standard gwmw screen intervals which typically range between 1 and 10 ft aller 1991 in addition gwmws are not useful in formations with very low hydraulic conductivities given the inability to produce sufficient water schneider et al 2020 alley 1993 direct drive tools such as the mip and the hpt can be used to acquire high resolution data even in low permeability media however they measure permeability rather than pore velocity do not provide speciation of contaminants and provide no data on geochemistry or microbial potential rosenberg et al 2021 a new alternative to traditional monitoring techniques for groundwater is the high resolution passive profiler hrpp schneider et al 2020 the hrpp is a single tool that simultaneously captures information on 1 dissolved species contaminants and geochemical parameters via equilibrium diffusion cells 2 pore water velocity from measurement of mass transfer coefficients schneider et al 2019 3 compound specific stable isotopes and 4 microbial populations the hrpp works by means of passive sampling that guarantees minimal disturbances of local conditions and it captures discrete data at a resolution of 20 cm providing detailed spatial information even in highly stratified systems in addition hrpp probes are direct driven allowing site assessment without the need for well installation previously the application of the hrpp has been compared to other high resolution site assessment methods including mip hpt vertically discrete 1 ft well screens and passive flux meters schneider et al 2020 in the previous study the hrpp produced comparable concentrations of contaminants and geochemical indicators and microbial abundances with respect to the vertical well screens pore velocities were comparable to passive flux meters and generally scaled with the hpt however the mip and ecd data did not correlate well with other measures of pore velocity or contaminant concentrations the use of hrpps requires two field events one for the deployment and 3 4 weeks later one for retrieval it also requires additional analysis costs based on the increased number of samples generated the hrpp is limited to locations conducive to direct drive technologies and generally shallow 30 40 ft bgs contaminated zones this study highlights the use of high resolution data produced by the hrpp to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of a biowall to remediate tce contaminated groundwater biowalls are trenches filled with bulk organic matter e g mulch compost that slowly decomposes to produce substrates e g fatty acids hydrogen that support the anaerobic biodegradation of contaminants including chlorinated solvents as groundwater migrates through the wall faisal et al 2018 obiri nyarko et al 2014 wilkin et al 2014 vogan et al 1999 walker jr et al 2020 in this case the most common degradation path is the microbial use of tce as electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration termed dehalorespiration the initial product is cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce which is terminal for a number of dehalorespiring organisms however other species can dehalogenate tce to cis dce and then further to vinyl chloride vc and finally to non toxic ethene c2h4 with dehalococcoides mccartyi being the most widely studied but a specific strain of dehalogenimonas also shows this activity löffler et al 2013 yang et al 2017 tce can also be oxidized cometabolically by various monooxygenases including soluble methane monooxygenase smmo and various toluene monooxygenases among others frascari et al 2015 in addition chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvocs can undergo abiotic degradation through the reduction by zero valent metals and sulfide minerals he et al 2015 whiting et al 2014 tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 the biowall that was the subject of this study was installed in 2013 in beltsville maryland usa niño de guzmán et al 2018a and has been monitored through traditional gwmws this field study which occurred in 2019 consisted of the deployment of hrpps at five locations to gather groundwater information hydraulically upgradient within and downgradient of the biowall the data from hrpps was

only summarized herein compared to the hrpp devices introduced previously schneider et al 2020 the model in this study has small changes in the design of cover plates and micro biotraps that make them easier to pre assemble 2 1 1 measurement of dissolved species in pore water dissolved species are measured using equilibrium diffusion sampling cleveland et al 2017 teasdale et al 1995 a sample cell 10 ml equilibrium cell in fig 1 is filled with ultra pure water spiked with sodium or potassium bromide br at 250 mg l the cell is covered with a microporous 0 45 μm opening nylon membrane sterlitech

diffuse across the membrane into the sample cell due to concentration gradients the cell specific surface area ssa i e area for mass transfer divided by cell volume is sufficient to nominally allow the content of the reservoir to reach at least 90 equilibrium in 3 weeks webster et al 1998 the br in the sample cell is a conservative tracer which is used to determine the extent of equilibration based on the remaining concentration at the time of retrieval in cases where the content of the sample cell is far from equilibrium concentration of other species can be adjusted based on br results for a full discussion of the general theory of diffusion equilibrium sampling see webster et al 1998 and for the hrpp specifically see schneider et al 2020 schneider et al 2019 2 1 2 measurement of pore water velocity pore water velocity is measured using an established relationship between the mass transfer coefficient for br exiting the velocity cells and the average pore water velocity schneider et al 2019 the velocity cells fig 1 consist of a set of four reservoirs with different ssa based on varying the volume of the cell and or the cell opening since the concentration of the tracer in pore water is negligible 0 5 mg l compared to the initial concentration in velocity cells a mass balance for br in the reservoir yields 1 c t c 0 exp kat v where c t and c 0 are the

2010 justicia leon et al 2012 2 1 4 measurement of cvoc transformation cvoc transformation is evaluated by csia wanner et al 2016 chiang et al 2012 hunkeler et al 2008 this technique relies on the fact that molecules containing a heavy isotope of an element e g tce with 13c are degraded more slowly than those with only light isotopes this fact typically results in an isotopic enrichment in the parent molecule with time known as a kinetic isotope effect which can be estimated by measuring delta δ values of elements in the parent compound over time in this case δ13c was measured for chlorinated ethenes present at each location csia was conducted by extracting chlorinated ethenes accumulated on the bio sep beads in the hrpps but when concentrations are sufficient the technique can be conducted using compounds collected in equilibrated pore water in the hrpp as well csia analysis was performed by microbial insights inc knoxville tn for this analysis target analytes are separated by gas chromatography and combusted to co2 that is then analyzed via isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms the isotope ratios are anchored to a reference co2 gas and the δ13c values are calculated 2 2 site background the site is located in the beltsville agricultural research center barc in maryland usa and belongs to the areas of concern aoc designated for environmental investigations and remediation see fig c 1 in si part c aoc barc 27 consists of the beaver dam road landfill located next to the beaver dam rd between research rd and bio control rd on the north bank of beaverdam creek from the 1940s to 1980s the site operated as a capped rubble landfill usda ars 2012 in 1998 a plume of contaminated groundwater coming from the landfill was identified with a concentration of tce

site including a biowall bmt designers and planners 2008 in 2011 usda ars in conjunction with the united states environmental protection agency us epa and bmt designers and planners selected the implementation of a biowall as the preferred remedy for the site bmt designers and planners 2011 in july 2013 the biowall was installed south of the former landfill in the direction of groundwater flow and the final dimensions were approximately 305 m long 5 5 to 7 m deep and 0 7 m wide the composition of the biowall by volume was 40 mulch 30 compost and 30 sand as stabilizing material based on gwmw sampling results within and downgradient of the barrier in 2014 and 2017 the biowall resulted in the complete removal of tce from the groundwater plume but with accumulation of cis dce as a daughter product bmt designers and planners 2015 bmt designers and planners 2018 one of the objectives of using the hrpp technology was to provide a better understanding of geochemical microbiological

the location with abbreviations from the unified soil classification system uscs details on stratigraphy for each location can be found in core logs in si part d depths are in reference to a common datum which corresponds to the ground surface in the biowall area see fig 2 3 1 location mw 6 mw 6 is a gwmw 20 m hydraulically upgradient of the biowall with a screening interval between 2 4 and 8 5 m below common datum bcd fig 2 groundwater was sampled at a depth of 3 0 m bcd and a bio trap was installed at the same depth next to the well 0 9 m a 3 6 m hrpp string was deployed which sampled pore water from 1 0 to 4 2 m bcd fig 2 based on visual observations of cores retrieved before deployment of the hrpp surface layers 3 5 m bcd consisted of layers of silt silt clay sand fine sand and silt clay to 3 5 m bcd below this depth there was gray silt and clay with trace fine sand and a uniform red clay layer layers ml and cl below 3 5 m in stratigraphy in fig 3 see also si part d figs 3 and 4 present a summary of data from the gwmw and the respective hrpp 3 1 1 cvocs in the monitoring well tce was present at 430 μg l minimum reporting limit mrl 12 μg l but cis dce mrl 9 μg l and vc mrl 18 μg l were not detected fig 3 the final daughter product of full dechlorination c2h4 mrl 5 μg l was not detected in the gwmw tce was detected in pore water at all depths sampled by the hrpp concentrations of tce increased with depth from 15 to 900 μg l and a rapid increase in concentration occurred between 3 0 and 3 5 m bcd the depth where clay started to appear in the core fig 3 cis dce was also measured in the hrpp cells at depths between 1 0 and 2 5 m bcd with a peak concentration of 150 μg l c2h4 was measured at low concentrations 20 μg l below 2 0 m bcd the stable isotope composition of c in tce δ13c 23 was identical for water sampled from the gwmw and the bio trap deployed in mw 6 fig 3 measurements of δ13c for tce in hrpp micro biotraps varied with depth ranging between 18 and 23 at the lowest sampled hrpp depth water from one of the equilibrium cells was also analyzed for δ13c in tce the δ13c value of tce collected from the hrpp equilibrated water sample and from bio sep beads in the micro biotraps were similar 19 9 and 21 5 respectively and within the range of other hrpp micro biotraps gwmw water and in well bio trap values the similarity of values suggests that sorption to the beads does not appreciably fractionate the tce the stable isotope composition on c in cis dce δ13c 26 was measurable at three depths which corresponded to the presence of cis dce measured in equilibrium cells around 2 0 m bcd the δ13c values of tce suggest uniform fractionation of tce with depth based on lower values compared to untransformed tce 33 5 to 24 5 hunkeler et al 2008 mcloughlin et al 2014 the cis dce δ13c values measured by the hrpp were depleted in 13c compared to the co occurring tce indicating that cis dce is a degradation product of tce in this plume as expected 3 1 2 geochemistry well water from mw 6 was oxic do 3 5 mg l had a positive orp 186 mv and ph of 4 8 in well water the concentration of so4 2 was 165 mg l fe2 was 7 2 mg l ch4 was 45 μg l and cl was 71 mg l fig 3 in equilibrated water from hrpp cells so4 2 concentrations increased from 60 to 150 mg l from 1 0 to 1 5 m bcd below which they remained relatively stable 150 mg l until a depth of 3 5 m bcd at which point so4 2 rapidly decreased with increasing depth fe2 concentrations in hrpp samples generally increased with depth 25 to 85 mg l dissolved ch4 in hrpp samples increased from 40 to 200 μg l with depth cl in pore water also increased with depth from 50 to 78 mg l depths below 3 5 m bcd appear to be more reducing based on increases in ch4 and reduction in so4 2 concentrations depths above 3 5 m seem to be dominated by fe reduction discrepancies in measured concentrations of fe2 between well water and hrpp samples may be due to oxidation in the well casing due to the presence of o2 from the possible mixing of aerobic and anaerobic groundwater ch4 so4 2 and cl concentrations between well water and hrpp samples were reasonably similar taking into account the dependence of concentrations on depth 3 1 3 velocity estimates and extent of equilibration pore water velocity estimates were between 2 and 7 cm d pore velocities were highest above 2 5 m bcd fig 3 this observation is consistent with expected conductivities of aquifer solid materials observed in retrieved cores around this depth fine to medium sand in addition the relative extent of equilibration in cells based on remaining br in equilibrium cells supports a low rate of mass transfer below 3 5 m bcd reflecting low permeability layers gray silt and clay see si part d 3 1 4 microbial populations and key functional genes fig 4 compares microbial abundances obtained from hrpp micro biotraps filled markers a commercial bio trap deployed in mw 6 unfilled markers and water from the well vertical lines in well water only two types of bacteria were quantifiable above detection limits sulfate reducers and dehalococcoides spp excluding total eubacteria the in well bio trap detected sulfate reducers but no dehalogenating organisms or other measured bacterial genes species or groups in both well water and the in well bio trap only one cometabolic gene toluene dioxygenase was detected in contrast using hrpp micro biotraps the presence at relatively high abundances of not only the species detected in well water but also the dehalogenating bacteria desulfuromonas spp dehalobacter spp and dehalobium chlorocoercia were detected hrpp micro biotraps also measured a number of co metabolic genes but none consistently with depth 3 1 5 summary and discussion based on both data from the hrpp and well water tce is the dominant cvoc at this hydraulically upgradient location based upon hrpp data the tce concentration was highest near the lower clay layer which corresponds to the lowest pore velocities and most reduced conditions based on the detection of reduced so4 2 presumably due to biological sulfate reduction and increased ch4 concentrations likely from methanogenesis at depths above the clay layer hrpp data show decreasing tce concentrations towards the surface with cis dce increasing to approximately equal concentrations as tce it should be noted that cis dce was not detected in groundwater collected from mw 6 the upper zone of the aquifer also was characterized by higher pore water velocities based upon hrpp data δ13c analysis shows that tce is similarly fractionated across all depths with the detected cis dce likely being the terminal product of the transformation process as there is no evidence of further dechlorination of cis dce with the available data it is unclear why cis dce was only observed in the upper section of the sampled area concentrations of tce so4 2 and cl were similar for gwmw and hrpp samples taking into account the depth 3 0 m bcd at which the well was sampled however the interpretation of the biogeochemistry as well as the fate and transport of tce is quite different between the two methods based on gwmw data there is no evidence of the higher cvoc concentration in the lower clay unit presence of cis dce evidence of partial reductive dehalogenation or the higher mass flux at depths above 2 5 m bcd in addition the geochemistry appears more oxic in the gwmw sample than many of the deeper hrpp samples and several bacterial genera capable of reducing tce desulfuromonas dehalobacter dehalobium were only detected using the hrpp not in well water or on in well bio traps the presence of these genera but not dehalococcoides or dehalogenimonas is consistent with the partial dechlorination of tce to cis dce as among these organisms only dehalococcoides and one known species of dehalogenimonas can transform tce completely to c2h4 löffler et al 2013 yang et al 2017 the consistent presence of these dehalogenating organisms in the micro biotraps but not on the groundwater samples or the commercial bio trap is also important in that it suggests that close proximity of the hrpp to the sediments may yield a more accurate assessment of the indigenous microbial community than either groundwater alone or beads suspended in groundwater within a well bore thus in this location the hrpp provided a much more detailed assessment of geochemical microbiological and contaminant conditions than sampling the existing gwmw 3 2 location bw 6 gwmw bw 6 is located within the biowall which spans from 0 5 to 5 8 m bcd with a screening interval from 1 4 to 6 0 m bcd fig 2 a bio trap was installed at 3 3 m bcd at the same depth from which gwmw was sampled next to the well 0 9 m a 3 6 m hrpp string was deployed which sampled pore water at depths from 1 6 to 4 8 m bcd fig 2 3 2 1 cvocs in the monitoring well cvocs were detected tce 21 μg l cis dce 131 μg l and vc 26 μg l with trace concentrations of c2h4 10 μg l fig 5 using the hrpp tce was not detected in pore water and cis dce and vc were detected only between 3 0 and 3 6 m bcd with peak concentrations of 95 and 64 μg l for cis dce and vc respectively measurable concentrations of c2h4 were found below 2 5 m bcd with peak concentrations 60 μg l occurring at similar depth 3 0 to 3 5 m bcd as cvocs the δ13c values for tce and cis dce present in groundwater from the gwmw or adsorbed to beads within the in well bio trap were similar between the two sampling methods but the δ13c values for tce 15 were much more positive than cis dce values 21 fig 5 the very positive i e highly enriched values of δ13c in tce combined with the much reduced concentrations compared to upgradient well mw 6 are consistent with significant reductive biotransformation of tce occurring in the biowall interestingly the cis dce δ13c values 21 were very similar to those in upgradient well mw 6 the csia data indicate appreciable conversion of tce to cis dce but little further degradation of cis dce the low concentration of vc with respect to cis dce in well bw 6 supports this analysis in the hrpps δ13c values were measurable only for cis dce and only for depths corresponding to the two highest concentrations 3 3 m bcd the δ13c values ranged from 8 to 4 showing significant c isotope fractionation compared to the bulk water or bio trap cis dce samples the hrpp data suggest that cis dce is degrading within the mulch biowall and that the bulk groundwater collected from the well including that in the vicinity of the suspended bio trap consists predominantly of that from zone s where cis dce is not being transformed 3 2 2 geochemistry well water from bw 6 was anoxic based on orp 55 mv and had a ph of 6 3 the do could not be determined due to interferences from the high concentration of doc from the biowall concentrations of so4 2 fe2 ch4 and cl in well water were 140 mg l 50 mg l 14 000 μg l and 67 mg l respectively fig 5 pore water concentrations measured using the hrpp were variable with depth concentrations of so4 2 were very low 1 5 mg l at all depths except for two depths between 3 0 to 3 5 m bcd high velocity zone where a concentration of 55 mg l was detected elevated concentrations of fe2 50 120 mg l were measured for all depths with highest concentrations at shallower depths and the lowest concentration 50 mg l at 3 3 m bcd ch4 was also measured throughout the sampled depth at concentrations between 4000 and 25 000 μg l with concentrations generally increasing with depth concentrations of cl were between 13 and 59 mg l with a defined peak in the profile at 3 0 m bcd both gwmw and hrpp samples support highly reducing conditions within the biowall compared to the upgradient mw 6 location geochemical indicators do not generally agree when considering average hrpp concentrations and those from the gwmw however if only the concentrations of geochemical indicators at depths between 3 0 and 3 5 m bcd are compared the values are more similar this observation is also true for concentrations of cl chloride concentration peaks at 3 2 m bcd and is very similar to the measured well concentration 59 and 66 mg l respectively while concentrations at lower and higher depths are much lower 3 2 3 velocity estimates and extent of equilibration estimations of pore water velocity were generally 5 cm d at all depths except between 3 0 and 3 5 m bcd where velocities increased to 10 40 cm d suggesting the biowall intersects a high permeability zone in the native soil the extents of equilibration f ss values were relatively uniform 90 with slightly higher values 100 around 3 4 m bcd similar f ss values provide indication of uniform permeability that reflects homogeneity of the barrier filling materials this observation suggests that the biowall has maintained its permeability and it has not affected the groundwater flow pattern in the original formation which is in line with observations in other studies walker jr et al 2020 shen et al 2012 3 2 4 microbial populations and key functional genes location bw 6 showed a diversity of organisms genes linked to reductive dehalogenation as well as aerobic cometabolism of cvocs there were a few more genera genes detected in water samples from the gwmw than the in well bio trap however all genera genes measured in well water were also measurable using the hrpp micro biotraps hrpp samples from five out of six analyzed depths showed detectable sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens with the former typically being 1 3 orders of magnitude more prevalent than the latter this fact was consistent with the low concentrations of so4 2 and high concentrations of ch4 in pore water in addition all cvoc reducing genera analyzed by this qpcr method desulfitobacterium desulfuromonas dehalococcoides dehalobacter dehalogenimonas and dehalobium were detected using the hrpp micro biotraps and in water collected from the gwmw the in well bio trap only detected three of these genera tce and vc reductase genes tcea and vcra were detected by all three sampling techniques several co metabolic genes were also consistently detected with depth and between sampling methods including smmo toluene monooxygenases and phenol hydroxylase this shows the co occurrence of organisms genes capable of anaerobic reductive dehalogenation and aerobic cometabolism of cvocs in the same environment 3 2 5 summary and discussion using data generated from gwmw samples and the hrpp the biowall is more reducing than the hydraulically upgradient location mw 6 and is promoting reductive dehalogenation of tce based on reduced concentration compared to upgradient samples and δ13c values abundances of species capable of anaerobically biotransforming tce suggest that main degradation path is biotic but the possibility of abiotic transformation is not discarded given the elevated levels of fe2 whiting et al 2014 dong et al 2009 there are several important factors that would not be revealed by evaluation of well water samples alone first based on bulk well water data it would appear that tce degradation is incomplete throughout the biowall the cis dce concentration is higher than vc tce is still detected albeit at a reduced concentration c2h4 is absent and δ13c cis dce values are similar to those from upgradient the data also suggest relatively weak reducing conditions as so4 2 remains in the water the depth dependent hrpp data suggests the biowall intersects a zone with high velocity between 3 0 and 3 5 m bcd which most likely is allowing insufficient residence time for complete reduction of tce in that specific area this hypothesis is supported by past studies that have measured cvocs downgradient of reactive barriers lu et al 2007 grajales mesa and malina 2019 gwmw bw 6 seems to draw water preferentially from the high velocity interval which also has higher so4 2 and lower ch4 concentrations than other depth intervals the hrpp data indicate that tce has been completely transformed to c2h4 at most depth intervals in the barrier 3 0 3 5 m bcd excluded and that conditions are highly reducing no so4 2 and high ch4 which is in line with biologically active biowalls alexander et al 2017 even in the high velocity zone the hrpp data suggest that tce degradation is much more complete than suggested by groundwater from bw 6 equal concentrations of cis dce vc and c2h4 no measurable tce and δ13c cis dce showing substantial fractionation it is possible that observations in this gwmw are reflective of water from the high velocity zone and that during pumping water was drawn from the formation outside and upgradient of the biowall resulting in the higher so4 2 lower ch4 and a less biodegraded cvoc profile i e higher tce and cis dce no c2h4 this possibility is supported by the fact that the sample was obtained from the depth where the high velocity was observed 3 3 location mw 10 gwmw mw 10 corresponds to a point 14 m downgradient of the biowall with a screening interval between 3 3 and 6 4 m bcd fig 2 no bio trap was installed because this well was 2 5 cm in diameter next to the well 0 9 m a 3 6 m hrpp string was deployed the hrpp sampled pore water from 1 9 to 5 1 m bcd fig 2 based on cores from this location soil composition consisted of sand with and without gravel and a clay layer below 4 5 m bcd layer cl in stratigraphy in fig 7 see also si part d 3 3 1 cvocs in the monitoring well cis dce was measured at 135 μg l which is similar to that within biowall well bw 6 cis dce 131 μg l no other cvocs were detected cis dce was measured in three samples from the hrpp with concentrations ranging from 23 to 45 μg l fig 7 the δ13c value of cis dce in well water from mw 10 21 4 was slightly more negative but similar to that measured in hrpp micro biotraps 18 8 and 19 the δ13c values of cis dce in the well and micro biotraps were similar to those collected from the gwmw in the biowall bw 6 21 but not from the hrpp placed in the biowall 8 to 4 which were comparatively enriched in 13c indicating additional cis dce biodegradation this could suggest that cis dce at mw 10 represents legacy cis dce downgradient of the biowall or more likely that cis dce treatment in the biowall is not uniform the reason that the concentrations of cis dce in hrpp cells at the mw 10 location were 3 to 5 fold lower than in the bulk groundwater is unclear it is possible that in spite of the lateral proximity 0 9 m the gwmw and the hrpp captured information from different soil seams since strata at this location can be highly heterogeneous given the proximity to the meanders of the unnamed tributary large differences in pore water concentrations of cvocs over small vertical and horizontal distances 0 5 m have been already observed in heterogeneous aquifers schneider et al 2020 3 3 2 geochemistry well water from mw 10 was anoxic orp of 30 mv and had a ph of 6 2 concentrations of so4 2 fe2 ch4 and cl in well water were 52 mg l 51 mg l 2750 μg l and 46 mg l respectively concentrations of so4 2 by hrpp were generally much lower than in the well 2 and 10 mg l except at a single point 2 1 m bcd where the concentration was 31 mg l fe2 in pore water ranged between 37 and 63 mg l except for one point 1 mg l highest concentrations of so4 2 fe2 ch4 and cl were found between 3 0 and 4 5 m bcd fig 7 at the shallowest depths the lower concentrations may be due to dilution with surface water concentrations of fe2 and ch4 were similar between hrpp cells at depths between 2 0 and 3 5 m bcd and gwmw water similar to mw 6 the so4 2 concentration in the gwmw was much higher than hrpp concentrations at any depth possibly suggesting oxidation of sulfide in the well or overrepresentation of less reduced groundwater from a high permeability seam gwmw water also had a slightly higher concentration of cl than any of the hrpp sampled depths 3 3 3 velocity estimates and extent of equilibration pore velocities were generally 2 cm d at all depths except near the surface 13 and 19 cm d hrpp sample cells were generally 80 equilibrated except at depths below 3 9 m bcd 60 and 80 corresponding to lower permeability material that is in line with the layer of clay observed in the core transition from sw to cl in stratigraphy in fig 7 see also si part d 3 3 4 microbial populations and key functional genes no bio trap was deployed in mw 10 because of the small diameter of the well but six hrpp micro biotraps were evaluated for microbial abundances fig 8 there were some differences noted in dehalogenating genera between gwmw water samples and hrpp micro biotraps in particular dehalogenimonas were only measured in well water and desulfitobacterium and desulfuromonas were only measured by hrpp micro biotraps abundances of detected species were highest at mid depths corresponding to the highest concentrations of so4 2 fe2 ch4 and cis dce lower levels and fewer functional genes were detected in the hrpp cells and groundwater in this zone compared to within the biowall vc reductase gene vcra was detected in only one hrpp cell and tce reductase gene tcea was not detected at all this observation suggests higher reductive dehalogenation potential within the biowall than either upgradient where no dehalogenases were detected or downgradient this is consistent with there being little change in the δ13c for cis dce in this zone compared to the biowall i e suggesting no further reductive degradation and the absence of other daughter products such as vc or c2h4 3 3 5 summary and discussion concentrations and δ13c values of cis dce in well water were comparable to those measured in the gwmw in the biowall 21 4 in mw 10 vs 21 5 in bw 6 suggesting little degradation occurred downgradient of the barrier the lower concentrations of cis dce at hrpp samples but similar δ13c values are unexplained but perhaps are due to a higher conductivity layer intersected by the well but not the hrpp this location is within the flood zone of the unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek and flow paths may be highly chaotic given historical meanderings of the tributary and likely alteration of flow path along the stream channel 3 4 locations without monitoring wells in addition to locations mw 6 bw 6 and mw 10 where monitoring wells are present two separate hrpps were deployed at locations dg 1 between bw 6 and mw 10 and downgradient from mw 10 within the unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek see fig 2 results for these locations are presented in figs c 2 through c 5 in si 3 4 1 dg 1 at dg 1 tce was detected at one depth at a concentration of 26 μg l and cis dce was measured at all five depths at values between 19 and 51 μg l concentrations of cis dce are similar to those captured downstream by the hrpp installed in location mw 10 interestingly tce was not detected in any of the hrpp cells or in well water from the mw 10 location concentrations varied for so4 2 from 18 to 107 mg l for fe2 from 81 to 125 mg l and for ch4 from 1900 to 4300 μg l the highest value of so4 2 is not consistent with neighbor locations where concentrations were lower high concentrations of fe2 are similar to those in the biowall and ch4 values are closer to the ones observed in mw 10 in the case of cl concentrations are uniform around 30 mg l and are similar to the highest concentration values observed in mw 10 at this location a high velocity 33 cm d was measured only at 2 5 m bcd where the highest extent of equilibration 98 was found these values again suggest a highly permeable layer in the top part of the sampled area this layer is in line with the distinctive intervals in locations bw 6 and mw 10 where high velocity was observed this is also the zone where tce was detected in the two selected depths for analysis of organisms capable of reductive dehalogenation desulfitobacterium dehalobacter and dehalobium were detected at low densities but vc reductase genes bvca and vcra and the tce reductase gene tcea were not present as noted for the downgradient location mw 10 this indicates a low potential for continuing reductive dehalogenation in this region of the local aquifer 3 4 2 unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek stream one hrpp segment was installed within the unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek stream channel at this location the only measured cvoc was cis dce at the deepest sampled depth 3 3 m bcd with a concentration of 17 μg l which is in the same depth where cis dce was observed in the hrpp at location mw 10 3 2 m bcd concentrations of so4 2 were between 9 and 27 mg l fe2 between 47 and 63 mg l and ch4 between 300 to 2500 μg l the concentration of cl was 15 mg l but increased to 30 mg l at the lowest sampled depth values of these geochemical parameters are similar to the ones observed by hrpp in mw 10 the profile of pore water velocity shows a well defined peak at 3 0 m bcd with a maximum of 22 cm d in general f ss values are closer to 100 indicating a region of very high permeability dehalogenating bacteria dehalobacter dehalobium and dehalococcoides were detected in one or more of the hrpp cells but none of the relevant dehalogenase genes were present 3 5 impact of sampling technique on site evaluation regardless of sampling technique hrpp or gwmw some gross observations were similar as illustrated by comparing gwmw data to hrpp averaged or maximum depth discrete data for each location fig c 8 in si there was a general reduction of cvocs across the site supported by δ13c values that indicate extensive conversion of tce to cis dce the most reducing conditions occurred in the biowall based on geochemical indicators e g so4 2 ch4 and fe2 as well as highest measured abundances and diversity of bacteria genes capable of reductive dechlorination figs c 6 and c 7 in si the concentration and site distribution of species that vary little with depth e g cl were also similar however numerous critical differences in the distribution fate and transport of cvocs are evident when using the high resolution hrpp data compared to gwmw data at location mw 6 tce concentration increases appreciably with depth and peak concentrations are 2 higher than in well water further tce is present in highest concentration near the clay layer present below 3 0 m bcd this would suggest that the clay may act as a long term source of tce to hydraulically downgradient areas muskus and falta 2018 muniruzzaman and rolle 2021 seyedabbasi et al 2012 in addition cis dce is present at shallower depths which is not indicated from well data estimates of groundwater velocities across the site based on slug pumping and tracer tests between 2 3 and 4 4 cm d in the vicinity of bw 6 bmt designers and planners 2017 match generally with hrpp measured velocities see fig 9 however the hrpp measured a zone of high pore water velocity 40 cm d present at 3 0 to 3 5 m bcd in the biowall in the biowall bw 6 using high resolution data cvocs are only present over a narrow depth range 3 0 to 3 5 m bcd and include reduced daughter products from tce beyond cis dce i e vc and c2h4 based only on gwmw data it would appear that cis dce is present over the whole biowall depth and there is little evidence of more reduced daughter products the presence of cvocs in the high velocity zone would be consistent with shorter residence times that have been observed in small areas of biowalls shen et al 2012 the differences in cvoc concentrations with depth and estimated groundwater velocities using gwmw or hrpp would lead to differences in estimated fluxes through the biowall and subsequent conclusions about its efficacy fluxes of cvocs in bw 6 based on gwmw data are 210 μg m2d for tce 1310 μg m2d for cis dce and 260 μg m2d for vc see si part b for calculations on the other hand based on hrpp data there was no estimated flux for tce and fluxes for the other cvocs are 840 μg m2d for cis dce and 620 μg m2d for vc see si part b based on gwmw data alone it would appear that the biowall is not performing well with only partial transformation of tce to cis dce and breakthrough across the entire depth of the biowall in contrast based on hrpp data the biowall appears to be performing as intended with partial breakthrough only occurring in the narrow zone of high velocity these differences in biowall assessment would extend to geochemical indicators based on hrpp data so4 2 is only present in the biowall in the high velocity zone where concomitantly ch4 is at a minimum while other depths have elevated concentrations this is consistent with complete dechlorination of tce at depths with low velocity and partial dechlorination in the high velocity zone due to the shorter retention time however based on gwmw data so4 2 is only slightly reduced compared to upgradient locations supporting incomplete cvoc transformation finally this difference in interpretation persists downgradient gwmw data from downgradient well mw 10 supports breakthrough of the biowall with cis dce concentrations similar to the biowall 130 μg l in contrast hrpp data for mw 10 suggest only sporadic presence of cis dce with depth this difference in concentration distribution results in differences of estimated mass fluxes for cis dce at this location 1355 μg m2d from gwmw data and 14 μg m2d from hrpp data see si part b using the gwmw data versus the hrpp data results in substantially different site assessments as illustrated by fig 10 based on the hrpp data cvocs are present upgradient of the biowall location mw 6 where tce concentrations are greatest in the lower less permeable zone and cis dce is present at low concentration in depths closer to the surface the biowall is completely transforming cvocs except in a narrow zone with high velocity in which transformation of tce is complete but cis dce transformation is incomplete high velocity zones continue downgradient but concentrations of cvocs occur only sporadically see fig 9 data also suggests that cvocs are not surfacing into the stream this contrasts to any assessment based on gwmw data alone in this case tce is present upgradient of the biowall but no information is available on depth dependent concentrations and no cis dce is present degradation occurs in the biowall but is incomplete with cis dce apparently present throughout the biowall depth downgradient mw 10 cis dce is present and it seems to migrate towards the stream 4 conclusion the results of this study support the need for high resolution sampling to understand the impact of heterogeneous formations with highly variable transport properties previously we have demonstrated that in source zones concentrations of cvocs can vary by orders of magnitude over short intervals 0 5 m and that peak concentrations are directly related to low permeability layers schneider et al 2020 here we again demonstrate that there can be substantial variations in distribution and flux of cvocs with depth that are only measurable using high resolution sampling although overall observations from hrpps and gwmws were grossly consistent if one averages the depth dependent data from the hrpps based on the high resolution data there were several important findings which were not discoverable using data from the gwmws at this location data from the hrpps indicate that cvocs are mainly transported within narrow intervals with high velocity the biowall was completely transforming tce to c2h4 except within the high velocity zone where the concentrations were reduced but breakthrough of cis dce was apparent hydraulically upgradient of the biowall concentrations of tce increased with depth where a low permeability zone exists that will likely remain as a long term source in addition although low concentrations of cis dce were present downgradient of the barrier surfacing into a downgradient stream unnamed tributary to beaverdam creek was not detected based on gwmws only the flux of tce and resultant cis dce would be overestimated the persistence of the tce plume would be underestimated and additional remedial actions could fail due to the previously unidentified high velocity layers thus this study demonstrates the utility of high resolution sampling to both characterize and to provide continuous monitoring of contaminated aquifers the hrpp sampling was able to capture the depth dependent heterogeneities in transport and transformation and enables more detailed conceptual models of the site that impact overall assessment of the biowall performance use of high resolution sampling would also better enable initial site assessments and subsequent remedial designs allowing better placement and understanding of required screen

1331,the excessive application of agricultural irrigation water and chemical fertilizer has increased crop yields to help meet the demand for food but it has also led to major water environment problem i e non point source nps pollution which needs to be addressed to achieve sustainable development targets although numerous studies have focused on the control and reduction of agricultural nps pollution from the perspective of irrigation and fertilizer the effects of different cropping systems on nps pollution ammonia nitrogen nh3 n in the dongjiang river basin drb were seldom assessed specifically variation in the nh3 n load was simulated and analyzed at the annual and semi annual scales under ten different cropping systems using the soil and water assessment tool swat model which was calibrated and validated with satisfactory statistical index values in the drb the results indicated that the nh3 n load decreased distinctly increased slightly decreased when sweet potato peanut and rice were planted respectively compared with mono cropping crop rotation could reduce the nh3 n load and the planting sequence of crops could affect the nh3 n load to a certain extent planting peanuts in spring would dramatically increase nh3 n load to evaluate nh3 n pollution a critical threshold of nh3 n emission 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 was proposed meeting the nh3 n emission threshold cannot be achieved by altering the cropping system alone additional measures are needed to reduce agricultural nps pollution this study facilitates the development of cropping systems and provides relevant information to aid the sustainable development of agriculture in the drb keywords ammonia nitrogen cropping system swat threshold dongjiang river basin 1 introduction hydrological processes and

2014 china produced 25 of the world s grain and fed nearly 20 of the world s population using less than 10 of the world s arable land through the heavy application of water fertilizers and pesticides piao et al 2010 in south china where both food security and rapid economic development are critically important because of the continuous growth of the human population wu et al 2017 the relation

availability of subsidized fertilizers in china yan et al 2020 yu et al 2019 other studies have indicated that different cropping systems e g mono cropping and rotation cropping are of significance for both increasing crop yields and decreasing the n leaching via field experiments sinnathamby et al 2017 mono cropping often fails to maximize light and heat resources and even induces more nutrient loss while rotation cropping has the opposite effect to some extent wang et al 2018 the nps pollution might be affected by different cropping systems at the watershed scale ti et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 have indicated that n surplus benchmark for double cropping system was roughly twice that of single cropping system using 4500 on farm field experiment which means double cropping system has the potential to accommodate more n and thus reduce n losses zhao et al 2015 have showed that rice fava bean and rice milk vetch crop rotation could achieve the half maximum reduction of n pollution providing a technically feasible low input solution to the n pollution problems zhang et al 2021 have identified the critical n fertilizer rate 180 196 kg n ha 1 for a radish cropping system in northern china with a four year field experiment to obtain optimum yields with minimal environmental pollution ricks however although numerous studies have focused on the impacts of different fertilizers and crops on nps pollution few studies concerned about the effect of the planting sequence of different crops which has the potential to make a difference on agricultural nps pollution using model simulation li et al 2021 wang et al 2018 therefore further simulating and quantitative analyzing the effects of different crop combinations and their planting sequences on nps pollution from the perspective of watershed is deemed necessary defining a safe boundary for water pollution is critically important for evaluating nps pollution and proposing a critical emission threshold of pollutants is necessary for effectively managing water pollution steffen et al 2015 in 2009 rockstrm et al 2009 initially proposed that approximately 25 ca 35 mt n year 1 of the current level of human nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere was identified to be an appropriate nitrogen security boundary but this was only a rough first guess and thus has a high degree of uncertainty recently some researchers have characterized the threshold of nitrogen emissions from regional scales utilizing water quality observations of representative rivers and lakes in china yu et al 2019 whereas others have attempted to determine the threshold of nitrogen emissions using nitrogen budget balance models de vries et al 2013 bodirsky et al 2014 however the relationships among nitrogen emissions nitrogen biochemical reactions and the nitrogen cycle are complex and often vary among regions this results in a high degree of uncertainty in estimates of an appropriate emission threshold of nitrogen here a simple and direct approach for determining the ammonia nitrogen emission thresholds of a river basin based on the statistics from the five year plan in china is proposed for providing references to better evaluate status quo of nps pollution the dongjiang river basin drb a main sub basin of the pearl river basin in south china is a major grain producing and irrigation area wang et al 2015 rice

ammonia nitrogen nh3 n under the different cropping systems in the drb moreover an emission threshold of nh3 n for the drb was derived from the statistics sbgp 2010 which provides an important standard for evaluating nh3 n load in the drb yu et al 2019 land cover meteorological conditions crop irrigation management and fertilizer inputs were considered in the swat model the overall objectives of this study were to 1 construct a model effective for characterizing drb based on the swat model 2 quantitatively analyze nh3 n variation under different cropping systems and sequences at

the forest is the main land use type based on a land use map from 2010 lai et al 2016 we focused on paddy field and dryland which are prone to agricultural nps pollution and urban land which is prone to point source ps and nps pollution because of high population densities and the presence of numerous factories mitchell 2005 there are six sub irrigation regions in the xia which were referred to as xia 1 to xia 6 the area of paddy field dryland and urban land in the xia ranged from 10 3 to 25 2 4 to 44 3 and 0 7 to 5 1 respectively table 1 among the land use types the largest area of paddy field dryland and urban land was in xia 2 xia 4 and xia 1 which were 13 978 3 9973 9 and 1578 1 ha accounting for 25 30 5 and 5 1 of the area in the xia respectively in xia 1 to xia 6 the total agricultural cultivation area paddy field and dryland was 9016 4 15 301 3 2081 9 17 092 4 8954 2 and 3811 6 ha accounting for 29 27 4 67 2 52 3 31 6 and 38 2 of the area in the xia respectively and the urban area

sown and harvested in early august and mid november respectively in dryland fig 2 the irrigation water and fertilizer inputs were calculated based on the data of the statistical yearbook in the xia which were considered an optimal measure and remained unchanged in all cropping systems more information on the actual cropping system and farming management operations in the xia is listed in table 2 the actual cropping system namely the benchmark scenario was used for comparative analysis with other scenarios the irrigation water was diverted from the nearby river surface water and the auto irrigation module in the swat model was used 2 3 model description and construction the swat model is a basin scale and semi distributed hydrological model used to simulate a series of processes such as precipitation and evaporation runoff generation and confluence sediment movement crop growth and the nitrogen and phosphorus cycle in the basin via a strong physical mechanism feng and shen 2021 li and fang 2021 the hydrological cycle is the driving force of other processes in the model and mainly includes two stages runoff generation and confluence and channel routing calculation the simulation in the first stage and second stage is based on the water balance equation arnold et al 1998 and the muskingum routing method ponce et al 1996 respectively see in the appendix more detailed information on the swat model is available in the swat theoretical documentation and can be downloaded from http swatmodel tamu edu neitsch et al 2011 based on dem and digital flow network information the drb was divided into 90 sub basins and 2175 hydrologic response units with a threshold of 5 5 and 5 for the land use map soil map and slope respectively 2 4 model calibration and validation the swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup is a program for calibrating swat models that can be used to perform calibration validation parameter sensitivity analysis one at a time and global and uncertainty analysis the swat cup links the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2007 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue algorithm jing et al 2008 the parameter solution parasol algorithm uniyal et al 2015 the metropolis monte carlo mcmc algorithm owen and tribble 2005 and the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm kennedy 2011 in this paper the sufi 2 algorithm was used for parameter optimization in the drb forty three parameters related to streamflow and nh3 n simulation were analyzed for sensitivity the one at a time sensitivity method was used to eliminate insensitive parameters and obtain sensitive parameters in the drb bo et al 2019 the sensitive parameters according to their sensitivity ranks were selected to calibrate and validate the swat model the monthly streamflow data of yuancheng lingxia and boluo stations were collected and analyzed over thirty years 1981 2010 the proposed calibration period was the first ten year record 1981 1990 and the validation period was the other twenty year record 1991 2010 the monthly nh3 n data of yuancheng and boluo stations were available for eight years 1993 2000 the first four year record 1993 1996 of monthly nh3 n was used to calibrate the model and the other four year record 1996 2000 was used for validation abundant evaluation criteria have been proposed to determine the performance of hydrological models moriasi 2007 here a series of numeric metric criteria were used to evaluate the performance of the swat model including the coefficient of determination r2 legates and mccabe 1999 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 li et al 2021b kling gupta efficiency kge knoben et al 2019 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 additional details on the swat model and its calibration and validation are shown in the appendix according to moriasi 2007 and liu 2020 the performance of the swat model is often considered satisfactory if r2 0 5 nse 0 5 kge 0 5 and pbias is within 25 for monthly simulations 2 5 threshold of nh3 n emission since the safe boundary concept was proposed by rockstrm et al 2009 numerous studies have estimated the safety threshold of various pollutants from global to local scales in this study a simple and direct method to obtain the safety threshold of nh3 n emission for drb is proposed by collecting and analyzing the statistical data from the national five year plan which is a programmatic and normative document in china with easily accessible data in china s 12th five year plan 2011 2015 the total national emission control target of nh3 n was 235 000 tons in 2015 including 4300 tons in heyuan and 9600 tons in huizhou sbgp 2010 this information combined with the statistical data and the area of heyuan and huizhou indicated that the nh3 n emission threshold was 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 more details and calculations are listed in the appendix evaluations of ammonia nitrogen pollution are more robust when they are based on the threshold of nh3 n emission 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 in the drb 2 6 multiple cropping system scenarios the main goal of this paper was to study the effects of different cropping systems and planting sequences different crop planting time in a year on variation in nh3 n at the xia the application of irrigation water and fertilizer was kept constant and at optimal levels table 2 the only variable that changed was the identity of the crops planted in paddy field and dryland all other inputs such as dem the land use map of 2010 the soil map meteorological data and pollution data remained unchanged to ensure that other factors did not affect the results a series of cropping system scenarios were designed by adjusting the crop types and their planting sequences table 3 rice peanut and sweet potato are the three most common and widely planted crops in the xia these three crops were planted in paddy field and dryland in different combinations the best performing swat model was used to simulate each scenario and the effects of different scenarios on nh3 n pollution were compared to provide a reference for water environment and agricultural management in the xia 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation the optimal parameter set is shown in table 4 the most sensitive parameter was cn2 for the hydrological process and nperco for the nitrogen cycle process in the drb using dem soil map and meteorological data 1978 2010 to build the swat model the monthly streamflow and nh3 n simulation results from 1981 to 2010 warm up period was 1978 1981 in the drb were obtained based on the land use map in 2010 the simulation and observations of streamflow and nh3 n in the yuancheng lingxia and boluo station during the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 4 the performance criteria r2 nse kge and pbias at yuancheng station were 0 78 0 74 0 85 and 6 8 for the monthly streamflow calibration and 0 80 0 75 0 87 and 6 7 for validation respectively fig 4a r2 nse and kge ranged from 0 83 to 0 93 and pbias was less than 10 at lingxia and boluo stations for streamflow calibration and validation fig 4b and c model performance was considered very good in both streamflow calibration and validation moriasi 2007 abbaspour et al 2007 for the calibration and validation of monthly nh3 n fig 4d and e the r2 nse and kge ranged from 0 41 to 0 63 and pbias was within 10 at yuancheng and boluo stations the nh3 n simulation results were considered satisfactory therefore the swat model performed well with the streamflow and nh3 n in the drb which can quantitatively assess nh3 n variation under different cropping system scenarios at the annual and semi annual scales in the xia 3 2 nh3 n load under the benchmark scenario under the actual cropping system the benchmark scenario in table 2 the average annual nh3 n simulation values of the six sub irrigation regions in the xia are shown in fig 5 the proportion of urban and agricultural cultivation area is also drawn the correlation between the proportion of urban area and agri area paddy field and dryland area and the nh3 n load was analyzed using multiple regression in r toothaker and larry 1994 the multiple and adjusted r2 was 0 79 and 0 65 both 0 5 respectively which indicated that there was a strong correlation between them and the increase in the proportion of urban area and agri area was the major cause of the increase in the nh3 n load the two r2 parameters were marginally significant p 0 1 because of the small statistical sample size six nh3 n load data points the maximum nh3 n load was 34 7 kg ha 1 year 1 in xia 3 and had the highest proportion of agri area and the second highest proportion of urban area accounting for 67 2 and 3 8 respectively the nh3 n load was 23 6 kg ha 1 year 1 in xia 1 with the highest proportion of urban area 5 1 but the second lowest proportion of agri area 29 the minimum nh3 n load was only 1 9 kg ha 1 year 1 in xia 2 which had the lowest proportion of agri area 27 4 the nh3 n load in xia 4 and xia 5 was 4 2 and 4 4 kg ha 1 year 1 and their proportion of urban area and agri area was 0 7 and 2 7 and 52 3 and 31 6 respectively however a higher nh3 n load 13 3 kg ha 1 year 1 in xia 6 was observed compared with xia 4 and xia 5 but the proportion of urban area and agri area in xia 6 was intermediate between 0 7 and 5 1 and 27 4 and 67 2 we speculate that this overestimation stems from the fact that xia 6 is located downstream of xia as pollutants accumulate downstream along with the generation and confluence of runoff 3 3 nh3 n load at the annual and semi annual scales in this study the reduction rate e kirschbaum 2004 was used to evaluate the control effect of nh3 n pollution in each scenario relative to the benchmark scenario see in the appendix the nh3 n load in the xia under each scenario was analyzed at the annual scale in the benchmark scenario bs the average annual nh3 n load of xia 1 to xia 6 was 23 6 1 9 34 7 4 2 4 4 and 13 3 kg ha 1 year 1 respectively fig 6 compared with bs the only change in scenarios i to v was the different crops and their planting sequence in dry land i to iii paddy field iv to vii and both land use types vii to x table 3 in scenario i the reduction rate e was non negative after peanuts were planted two harvests in one year which was used in all scenarios in dryland indicating that the nh3 n load was increased with a maximum increase of 7 6 in xia 6 in scenario ii the e was non positive after sweet potato were planted in dryland indicating that the nh3 n load was decreased the maximum decrease was 10 5 in xia 6 in scenario iii the sequence of crops planted in dryland was changed from sp asp to ssp ap and e was non positive indicating that the nh3 n load could be affected by altering the planting sequence of peanut and sweet potato and the nh3 n load could be reduced by planting sweet potato in spring and peanut in autumn a maximum reduction of 4 5 was observed in xia 6 for scenario iv to vii different crops sr asp in iv and sr ap in v and sequences of crops ssp ar in vi and sp ar in vii were planted in paddy field in scenarios iv and vi the e value was negative especially in scenario vi which indicated that the rotation of rice and sweet potato could reduce nh3 n load and the ssp ar system was more conducive to reducing nh3 n pollution the maximum reduction observed was 14 in xia 2 in contrast there was a clear difference in scenario v and vii the e value was positive especially in scenario vii which indicated that the planting of peanut tended to increase nh3 n load especially in the spring the greatest increase observed was 29 in xia 2 compared scenario vii with scenario i to vi the planting sequence of different crops can affect nh3 n load which indicated that planting peanuts in the spring caused higher levels of nh3 n load while planting sweet potato or rice in the spring reduced nh3 n load for scenarios vii to x peanut sweet potato and rice were planted in both paddy field and dryland respectively i e mono cropping of peanut sweet potato and rice the same pattern of nh3 n pollution was observed the nh3 n load increased significantly and reached a maximum 28 3 when peanut was planted but decreased significantly and reached a minimum 20 3 when sweet potato was planted it also decreased maximum reduction 4 6 slightly when rice was planted the variation in and patterns of nh3 n load were analyzed in the xia at the semi annual scale i e the growing period and fallow period migliorati et al 2020 wood et al 2016 xu et al 2020 xu et al 2020a 2020b showed that n fertilizer application in the growing season and the subsequent fallow period increases methane emissions zhang and ren 2021 assessed how different fallow scenarios affect the water balance and crop yields using the swat model xinjun et al 2021 studied the effects of different tillage systems on soil water retention through field experiments during the growing season according to table 2 march to september was the intensive period of crop cultivation and growth and january february and october to december were the fallow or harvest periods in the xia therefore we considered march to august to represent the growing period and january february and september to december to represent the fallow period to study variation of the nh3 n load in two different periods within a year fig 7 all of the ratios of the growing period fallow period were greater than one except for xia 4 under scenario vi to ix which was equal to one in xia 1 to xia 3 the ratio was greater than 2 which indicated that the emission of nh3 n during the growing period accounted for at least half of the total amount of nh3 n with an average proportion of 65 7 and a maximum of 93 3 the main reason for the high nh3 n load in the growing period might stem from the heavy and concentrated rainfall march to july and increased fertilizer application xiang et al 2007 huang and nie 2012 during the fallow period the crops were harvested and the land was idle however heavy rain might also lead to the loss of fertilizer in the soil thereby causing pollution lin et al 2007 li et al 2020 we thus needed to more carefully consider the nps pollution of agricultural nh3 n during the completely growing period and the sudden pollution caused by strong rainfall during the fallow period quantifying the control standard of nh3 n emission is necessary for evaluating and managing nh3 n pollution according to the statistical data in china s twelfth five year plan the nh3 n emission threshold value of the xia was calculated as 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 the nh3 n load in half of the scenarios and sub irrigation regions exceeded the critical threshold of nh3 n as shown in fig 7 which poses a severe challenge for nh3 n control different cropping scenarios could reduce the nh3 n load but the reduction was not large enough to lower nh3 n emissions below the threshold under any scenario the nh3 n load in xia 1 xia 3 and xia 6 cannot reach the nh3 n threshold even in scenario ix minimum nh3 n load the nh3 n load of xia 1 xia 3 and xia 6 was still 4 1 5 8 and 2 1 times higher than the threshold respectively therefore stronger measures need to be taken to reduce agricultural nh3 n load 4 discussion the types of fertilizer n p ratio and its application amount are different among crops to maximum satisfy yields and nps pollution limitation abundant studies have indicated that different soil fertilities are needed for various crops through model simulation pathak h et al 2003 statistical survey sheldrick et al 2003 and field experiment zhao et al 2010 in this study the n p ratio and its amount as well as irrigation management were determined through statistical yearbook and field investigation and kept constant for all simulations to better evaluate the effects of different crops on nh3 n load excluded fertilizer interference which also indicates that the types and amounts of fertilizer are worth further studying as a compound multivariate factor nitrogen fixation is an important biological process in peanut growth leaving a high mineral nitrogen concentration in the soil which is prone to n leaching chu et al 2004 hartemink et al 2000 have indicated that sweet potato could absorb a large amount of n with a high utilization efficiency during its growth and harvest which means that mineral n concentration is relatively low causing less leaching loss yanzhang et al 2005 suggested that the lack of legume protein genes in rice might lead to its inability for nodulation and nitrogen fixation which shows that more fertilizer inputs are needed for rice in this study the nh3 n load in scenario vii peanut scenario ix sweet potato and scenario x rice reached a maximum minimum and a slight decrease respectively as shown in fig 6 which is consistent with previous research results for the effects of crop planting sequence on nh3 n load many studies have suggested that agricultural nps pollution mainly comes from soil erosion and leaching caused by rainfall huang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 bai et al 2020 which indicates that nps pollution will become more critical when rainfall is heavy and intense the rainfall in the drb principally occurs in wet season march to august as shown in fig 2 which is consistent with the planting time of sowing in early spring and harvesting in late summer for peanut planting high soil n concentration there will be a significant problem of high nh3 n load when peanut is planted in spring scenario vii while it is less of a problem when peanut is planted in autumn because of less rainfall scenario iii for sweet potato planting low soil n concentration there will be a prominent decrease for nh3 n load when sweet potato is planted in spring scenario ii iii and vi similar pattern is observed for rice scenario iv v and vii there is a decrease trend in nh3 n load when rice is planted in spring which indicates planting sequence of crops have a double influence on nh3 n load to some extent further consideration about crop yields of these three crops using swat model the simulation accuracy of the results is not satisfactory with a high degree of uncertainty we are expanding and adjusting the parameter database gassman et al 2007 to improve the simulation results however due to the lack of more detailed data via field experiment sinnathamby et al 2017 further improvement of the simulation results is hindered numerous studies have indicated that mono cropping will easily lead to soil fertility decline microbial community degradation crop yield reduction and severe nps pollution which is called mono cropping obstacles wang et al 2018 contrary to mono cropping crop rotation can effectively avoid the obstacles of mono cropping ding et al 2018 planting sweet potato and rice in spring and peanut in autumn is better to ensure both cereal yields and economic benefit for farmers and agricultural manager which can also maximize the reduction of nh3 n load to achieve the sustainable development of water environment in the drb more management measures are needed to carry out to meet the nh3 n emission threshold such as applying fertilizer products properly and at an appropriate rate time and location zhang et al 2015 increasing nutrient recycling rates kh and yk 2019 georgianna and mayfield 2012 using conservation tillage approaches wang et al 2016 shao et al 2016 rusu and teodor 2014 and improving irrigation water management bastani and harter 2019 in this study because of a lack of detailed agricultural information only three crops rice peanut and sweet potato and their planting collocations were considered in addition the same chemical fertilizer was applied in the xia and the effects of different types of chemical fertilizers and the application amount of chemical fertilizer on agricultural nps pollution were not considered there is thus a need to conduct more simulations and experiments with more types of crops and different fertilizer applications in future studies to promote the prevention and control of agricultural nps pollution 5 conclusions a modelling approach allowed us to identify which should be the most preferable cropping system and its planting sequence to maximum the reduction of nh3 n load in the xia a typical intensive agricultural irrigation area in the drb of south china our findings indicated that there would reach a significant increase 28 3 distinct decrease 20 3 and slight decrease 4 6 in nh3 n load when peanuts sweet potato and rice were planted respectively in addition crop rotation could reduce the nh3 n load 5 25 and sp asp and sp ar planting sequence achieved the maximum reduction of nh3 n load which would provide references for suitable cropping system in drb a critical threshold of nh3 n emission 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 in drb was proposed to effectively manage water pollution which stronger measures are needed to reduce agricultural nps pollution to meet the threshold declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

1331,the excessive application of agricultural irrigation water and chemical fertilizer has increased crop yields to help meet the demand for food but it has also led to major water environment problem i e non point source nps pollution which needs to be addressed to achieve sustainable development targets although numerous studies have focused on the control and reduction of agricultural nps pollution from the perspective of irrigation and fertilizer the effects of different cropping systems on nps pollution ammonia nitrogen nh3 n in the dongjiang river basin drb were seldom assessed specifically variation in the nh3 n load was simulated and analyzed at the annual and semi annual scales under ten different cropping systems using the soil and water assessment tool swat model which was calibrated and validated with satisfactory statistical index values in the drb the results indicated that the nh3 n load decreased distinctly increased slightly decreased when sweet potato peanut and rice were planted respectively compared with mono cropping crop rotation could reduce the nh3 n load and the planting sequence of crops could affect the nh3 n load to a certain extent planting peanuts in spring would dramatically increase nh3 n load to evaluate nh3 n pollution a critical threshold of nh3 n emission 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 was proposed meeting the nh3 n emission threshold cannot be achieved by altering the cropping system alone additional measures are needed to reduce agricultural nps pollution this study facilitates the development of cropping systems and provides relevant information to aid the sustainable development of agriculture in the drb keywords ammonia nitrogen cropping system swat threshold dongjiang river basin 1 introduction hydrological processes and

singh et al 2021 to meet the needs basic food and dietary change of a growing population gaugler et al 2020 zhou and duan 2021 according to statistics from national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2014 china produced 25 of the world s grain and fed nearly 20 of the world s population using less than 10 of the world s arable land through the heavy application of water fertilizers and pesticides piao et al 2010 in south china where both food security and rapid economic development are critically important because of the continuous growth of the human population wu et al 2017 the relation between food security and the application of water fertilizers and pesticides must be improved wu et al 2019 liang et al 2020 however excessive losses of nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizer from cropland into watersheds lead to agricultural non point source nps pollution which poses a threat to ecosystem and society hou et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 controlling and managing agricultural nps pollution is particularly important in river basins however maintaining high grain yield while minimizing water pollution remains a major challenge provolo et al 2016 soldatova et al 2017 lockhart et al 2013 numerous studies have compared agricultural nps pollution caused by different quantities of fertilizer inputs under the same cropping system at the small field scale yang and lin 2019 sun et al 2012 zou et al 2010 china accounted for approximately 20 of the world s consumption of fertilizers in 2018 fao 2018 which are expected to increase for the next several decades because of the availability of subsidized fertilizers in china yan et al 2020 yu et al 2019 other studies have indicated that different cropping systems e g mono cropping and rotation cropping are of significance for both increasing crop yields and decreasing the n leaching via field experiments sinnathamby et al 2017 mono cropping often fails to maximize light and heat resources and even induces more nutrient loss while rotation cropping has the opposite effect to some extent wang et al 2018 the nps pollution might be affected by different cropping systems at the watershed scale ti et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 have indicated that n surplus benchmark for double cropping system was roughly twice that of single cropping system using 4500 on farm field experiment which means double cropping system has the potential to accommodate more n and thus reduce n losses zhao et al 2015 have showed that rice fava bean and rice milk vetch crop rotation could achieve the half maximum reduction of n pollution providing a technically feasible low input solution to the n pollution problems zhang et al 2021 have identified the critical n fertilizer rate 180 196 kg n ha 1 for a radish cropping system in northern china with a four year field experiment to obtain optimum yields with minimal environmental pollution ricks however although numerous studies have focused on the impacts of different fertilizers and crops on nps pollution few studies concerned about the effect of the planting sequence of different crops which has the potential to make a difference on agricultural nps pollution using model simulation li et al 2021 wang et al 2018 therefore further simulating and quantitative analyzing the effects of different crop combinations and their planting sequences on nps pollution from the perspective of watershed is deemed necessary defining a safe boundary for water pollution is critically important for evaluating nps pollution and proposing a critical emission threshold of pollutants is necessary for effectively managing water pollution steffen et al 2015 in 2009 rockstrm et al 2009 initially proposed that approximately 25 ca 35 mt n year 1 of the current level of human nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere was identified to be an appropriate nitrogen security boundary but this was only a rough first guess and thus has a high degree of uncertainty recently some researchers have characterized the threshold of nitrogen emissions from regional scales utilizing water quality observations of representative rivers and lakes in china yu et al 2019 whereas others have attempted to determine the threshold of nitrogen emissions using nitrogen budget balance models de vries et al 2013 bodirsky et al 2014 however the relationships among nitrogen emissions nitrogen biochemical reactions and the nitrogen cycle are complex and often vary among regions this results in a high degree of uncertainty in estimates of an appropriate emission threshold of nitrogen here a simple and direct approach for determining the ammonia nitrogen emission thresholds of a river basin based on the statistics from the five year plan in china is proposed for providing references to better evaluate status quo of nps pollution the dongjiang river basin drb a main sub basin of the pearl river basin in south china is a major grain producing and irrigation area wang et al 2015 rice

ammonia nitrogen nh3 n under the different cropping systems in the drb moreover an emission threshold of nh3 n for the drb was derived from the statistics sbgp 2010 which provides an important standard for evaluating nh3 n load in the drb yu et al 2019 land cover meteorological conditions crop irrigation management and fertilizer inputs were considered in the swat model the overall objectives of this study were to 1 construct a model effective for characterizing drb based on the swat model 2 quantitatively analyze nh3 n variation under different cropping systems and sequences at annual and semi annual scales under the same optimized irrigation management and fertilizer inputs and 3 determine the critical threshold of nh3 n load and provide suggestions for the sustainable

the forest is the main land use type based on a land use map from 2010 lai et al 2016 we focused on paddy field and dryland which are prone to agricultural nps pollution and urban land which is prone to point source ps and nps pollution because of high population densities and the presence of numerous factories mitchell 2005 there are six sub irrigation regions in the xia which were referred to as xia 1 to xia 6 the area of paddy field dryland and urban land in the xia ranged from 10 3 to 25 2 4 to 44 3 and 0 7 to 5 1 respectively table 1 among the land use types the largest area of paddy field

which were considered an optimal measure and remained unchanged in all cropping systems more information on the actual cropping system and farming management operations in the xia is listed in table 2 the actual cropping system namely the benchmark scenario was used for comparative analysis with other scenarios the irrigation water was diverted from the nearby river surface water and the auto irrigation module in the swat model was used 2 3 model description and construction the swat model is a basin scale and semi distributed hydrological model used to simulate a series of processes such as precipitation and evaporation runoff generation and confluence sediment movement crop growth and the nitrogen and phosphorus cycle in the basin via a strong physical mechanism feng and shen 2021 li and fang 2021 the hydrological cycle is the driving force of other processes in the model and mainly includes two stages runoff generation and confluence and channel routing calculation the simulation in the first stage and second stage is based on the water balance equation arnold et al 1998 and the muskingum routing method ponce et al 1996 respectively see in the appendix more detailed information on the swat model is available in the swat theoretical documentation and can be downloaded from http swatmodel tamu edu neitsch et al 2011 based on dem and digital flow network information the drb was divided into 90 sub basins and 2175 hydrologic response units with a threshold of 5 5 and 5 for the land use map soil map and slope respectively 2 4 model calibration and validation the swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup is a program for calibrating swat models that can be used to perform calibration validation parameter sensitivity analysis one at a time and global and uncertainty analysis the swat cup links the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2015 abbaspour et al 2007 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue

kennedy 2011 in this paper the sufi 2 algorithm was used for parameter optimization in the drb forty three parameters related to streamflow and nh3 n simulation were analyzed for sensitivity the one at a time sensitivity method was used to eliminate insensitive parameters and obtain sensitive parameters in the drb bo et al 2019 the sensitive parameters according to their sensitivity ranks were selected to calibrate and validate the swat model the monthly streamflow data of yuancheng lingxia and boluo stations were collected and analyzed over thirty years 1981 2010 the proposed calibration period was the first ten year record 1981 1990 and the validation period was the other twenty year record 1991 2010 the monthly nh3 n data of yuancheng and boluo stations were available for eight years 1993 2000 the first four year record 1993 1996 of monthly nh3 n was used to calibrate the model and the other four year record 1996 2000 was used for validation abundant evaluation criteria have been proposed to determine the performance of hydrological models moriasi 2007 here a series of numeric metric criteria were used to evaluate the performance of the swat model including the coefficient of determination r2 legates and mccabe 1999 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 li et al 2021b kling gupta efficiency kge knoben et al 2019 and percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 additional details on the swat model and its calibration and validation are shown in the appendix according to moriasi 2007 and liu 2020 the performance of the swat model is often considered satisfactory if r2 0 5 nse 0 5 kge 0 5 and pbias is within 25 for monthly simulations 2 5 threshold of nh3 n emission since the safe boundary concept was proposed by rockstrm et al 2009 numerous studies have estimated the safety threshold of various pollutants from global to local scales in this study a simple and direct method to obtain the safety threshold of nh3 n emission for drb is proposed by collecting and analyzing the statistical data from the national five year plan which is a programmatic and normative document in china with easily accessible data in china s 12th five year plan 2011 2015 the total national emission control target of nh3 n was 235 000 tons in 2015 including 4300 tons in heyuan and 9600 tons in huizhou sbgp 2010 this information combined with the statistical data and the area of heyuan and huizhou indicated that the nh3 n emission threshold was 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 more details and calculations are listed in the appendix evaluations of ammonia nitrogen pollution are more robust when they are based on the threshold of nh3 n emission 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 in the drb 2 6 multiple cropping system scenarios the main goal of this paper was to study the effects of different cropping systems and planting sequences different crop planting time in a year on variation in nh3 n at the xia the application of irrigation water and fertilizer was kept constant and at optimal levels table 2 the only variable that changed was the identity of the crops planted in paddy field and dryland all other inputs such as dem the land use map of 2010 the soil map meteorological data and pollution data remained unchanged to ensure that other factors did not affect the results a series of cropping system scenarios were designed by adjusting the crop types and their planting sequences table 3 rice peanut and sweet potato are the three most common and widely planted crops in the xia these three crops were planted in paddy field and dryland in different combinations the best performing swat model was used to simulate each scenario and the effects of different scenarios on nh3 n pollution were compared to provide a reference for water environment and agricultural management in the xia 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation the optimal parameter set is shown in table 4 the most sensitive parameter was cn2 for the hydrological process and nperco for the nitrogen cycle process in the drb using dem soil map and meteorological data 1978 2010 to build the swat model the monthly streamflow and nh3 n simulation results from 1981 to 2010 warm up period was 1978 1981 in the drb were obtained based on the land use map in 2010 the simulation and observations of streamflow and nh3 n in the yuancheng lingxia and boluo station during the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 4 the performance criteria r2 nse kge and pbias at yuancheng station were 0 78 0 74 0 85 and 6 8 for the monthly streamflow calibration and 0 80 0 75 0 87 and 6 7 for validation respectively fig 4a r2 nse and kge ranged from 0 83 to 0 93 and pbias was less than 10 at lingxia and boluo stations for streamflow calibration and validation fig 4b and c model performance was considered very good in both streamflow calibration and validation moriasi 2007 abbaspour et al 2007 for the calibration and validation of monthly nh3 n fig 4d and e the r2 nse and kge ranged from 0 41 to 0 63 and pbias was within 10 at yuancheng and boluo stations the nh3 n simulation results were considered satisfactory therefore the swat model performed well with the streamflow and nh3 n in the drb which can quantitatively assess nh3 n variation under different cropping system scenarios at the annual and semi annual scales in the xia 3 2 nh3 n load under the benchmark scenario under the actual cropping system the benchmark scenario in table 2 the average annual nh3 n simulation values of the six sub irrigation regions in the xia are shown in fig 5 the proportion of urban and agricultural cultivation area is also drawn the correlation between the proportion of urban area and agri area paddy field and dryland area and the nh3 n load was analyzed using multiple regression in r toothaker and larry 1994 the multiple and adjusted r2 was 0 79 and 0 65 both 0 5 respectively which indicated that there was a strong correlation between them and the increase in the proportion of urban area and agri area was the major cause of the increase in the nh3 n load the two r2 parameters were marginally significant p 0 1 because of the small statistical sample size six nh3 n load data points the maximum nh3 n load was 34 7 kg ha 1 year 1 in xia 3 and had the highest proportion of agri area and the second highest proportion of urban area accounting for 67 2 and 3 8 respectively the nh3 n load was 23 6 kg ha 1 year 1 in xia 1 with the highest proportion of urban area 5 1 but the second lowest proportion of agri area 29 the minimum nh3 n load was only 1 9 kg ha 1 year 1 in xia 2 which had the lowest proportion of agri area 27 4 the nh3 n load in xia 4 and xia 5 was 4 2 and 4 4 kg ha 1 year 1 and their proportion of urban area and agri area was 0 7 and 2 7 and 52 3 and 31 6 respectively however a higher nh3 n load 13 3 kg ha 1 year 1 in xia 6 was observed compared with xia 4 and xia 5 but the proportion of urban area and agri area in xia 6 was intermediate between 0 7 and 5 1 and 27 4 and 67 2 we speculate that this overestimation stems from the fact that xia 6 is located downstream of xia as pollutants accumulate downstream along with the generation and confluence of runoff 3 3 nh3 n load at the annual and semi annual scales in this study the reduction rate e kirschbaum 2004 was used to evaluate the control effect of nh3 n pollution in each scenario relative to the benchmark scenario see in the appendix the nh3 n load in the xia under each scenario was analyzed at the annual scale in the benchmark scenario bs the average annual nh3 n load of xia 1 to xia 6 was 23 6 1 9 34 7 4 2 4 4 and 13 3 kg ha 1 year 1 respectively fig 6 compared with bs the only change in scenarios i to v was the different crops and their planting sequence in dry land i to iii paddy field iv to vii and both land use types vii to x table 3 in scenario i the reduction rate e was non negative after peanuts were planted two harvests in one year which was used in all scenarios in dryland indicating that the nh3 n load was increased with a maximum increase of 7 6 in xia 6 in scenario ii the e was non positive after sweet potato were planted in dryland indicating that the nh3 n load was decreased the maximum decrease was 10 5 in xia 6 in scenario iii the sequence of crops planted in dryland was changed from sp asp to ssp ap and e was non positive indicating that the nh3 n load could be affected by altering the planting sequence of peanut and sweet potato and the nh3 n load could be reduced by planting sweet potato in spring and peanut in autumn a maximum reduction of 4 5 was observed in xia 6 for scenario iv to vii different crops sr asp in iv and sr ap in v and sequences of crops ssp ar in vi and sp ar in vii were planted in paddy field in scenarios iv and vi the e value was negative especially in scenario vi which indicated that the rotation of rice and sweet potato could reduce nh3 n load and the ssp ar system was more conducive to reducing nh3 n pollution the maximum reduction observed was 14 in xia 2 in contrast there was a clear difference in scenario v and vii the e value was positive especially in scenario vii which indicated that the planting of peanut tended to increase nh3 n load especially in the spring the greatest increase observed was 29 in xia 2 compared scenario vii with scenario i to vi the planting sequence of different crops can affect nh3 n load which indicated that planting peanuts in the spring caused higher levels of nh3 n load while planting sweet potato or rice in the spring reduced nh3 n load for scenarios vii to x peanut sweet potato and rice were planted in both paddy field and dryland respectively i e mono cropping of peanut sweet potato and rice the same pattern of nh3 n pollution was observed the nh3 n load increased significantly and reached a maximum 28 3 when peanut was planted but decreased significantly and reached a minimum 20 3 when sweet potato was planted it also decreased maximum reduction 4 6 slightly when rice was planted the variation in and patterns of nh3 n load were analyzed in the xia at the semi annual scale i e the growing period and fallow period migliorati et al 2020 wood et al 2016 xu et al 2020 xu et al 2020a 2020b showed that n fertilizer application in the growing season and the subsequent fallow period increases methane emissions zhang and ren 2021 assessed how different fallow scenarios affect the water balance and crop yields using the swat model xinjun et al 2021 studied the effects of different tillage systems on soil water retention through field experiments during the growing season according to table 2 march to september was the intensive period of crop cultivation and growth and january february and october to december were the fallow or harvest periods in the xia therefore we considered march to august to represent the growing period and january february and september to december to represent the fallow period to study variation of the nh3 n load in two different periods within a year fig 7 all of the ratios of the growing period fallow period were greater than one except for xia 4 under scenario vi to ix which was equal to one in xia 1 to xia 3 the ratio was greater than 2 which indicated that the emission of nh3 n during the growing period accounted for at least half of the total amount of nh3 n with an average proportion of 65 7 and a maximum of 93 3 the main reason for the high nh3 n load in the growing period might stem from the heavy and concentrated rainfall march to july and increased fertilizer application xiang et al 2007 huang and nie 2012 during the fallow period the crops were harvested and the land was idle however heavy rain might also lead to the loss of fertilizer in the soil thereby causing pollution lin et al 2007 li et al 2020 we thus needed to more carefully consider the nps pollution of agricultural nh3 n during the completely growing period and the sudden pollution caused by strong rainfall during the fallow period quantifying the control standard of nh3 n emission is necessary for evaluating and managing nh3 n pollution according to the statistical data in china s twelfth five year plan the nh3 n emission threshold value of the xia was calculated as 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 the nh3 n load in half of the scenarios and sub irrigation regions exceeded the critical threshold of nh3 n as shown in fig 7 which poses a severe challenge for nh3 n control different cropping scenarios could reduce the nh3 n load but the reduction was not large enough to lower nh3 n emissions below the threshold under any scenario the nh3 n load in xia 1 xia 3 and xia 6 cannot reach the nh3 n threshold even in scenario ix minimum nh3 n load the nh3 n load of xia 1 xia 3 and xia 6 was still 4 1 5 8 and 2 1 times higher than the threshold respectively therefore stronger measures need to be taken to reduce agricultural nh3 n load 4 discussion the types of fertilizer n p ratio and its application amount are different among crops to maximum satisfy yields and nps pollution limitation abundant studies have indicated that different soil fertilities are needed for various crops through model simulation pathak h et al 2003 statistical survey sheldrick et al 2003 and field experiment zhao et al 2010 in this study the n p ratio and its amount as well as irrigation management were determined through statistical yearbook and field investigation and kept constant for all simulations to better evaluate the effects of different crops on nh3 n load excluded fertilizer interference which also indicates that the types and amounts of fertilizer are worth further studying as a compound multivariate factor nitrogen fixation is an important biological process in peanut growth leaving a high mineral nitrogen concentration in the soil which is prone to n leaching chu et al 2004 hartemink et al 2000 have indicated that sweet potato could absorb a large amount of n with a high utilization efficiency during its growth and harvest which means that mineral n concentration is relatively low causing less leaching loss yanzhang et al 2005 suggested that the lack of legume protein genes in rice might lead to its inability for nodulation and nitrogen fixation which shows that more fertilizer inputs are needed for rice in this study the nh3 n load in scenario vii peanut scenario ix sweet potato and scenario x rice reached a maximum minimum and a slight decrease respectively as shown in fig 6 which is consistent with previous research results for the effects of crop planting sequence on nh3 n load many studies have suggested that agricultural nps pollution mainly comes from soil erosion and leaching caused by rainfall huang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 bai et al 2020 which indicates that nps pollution will become more critical when rainfall is heavy and intense the rainfall in the drb principally occurs in wet season march to august as shown in fig 2 which is consistent with the planting time of sowing in early spring and harvesting in late summer for peanut planting high soil n concentration there will be a significant problem of high nh3 n load when peanut is planted in spring scenario vii while it is less of a problem when peanut is planted in autumn because of less rainfall scenario iii for sweet potato planting low soil n concentration there will be a prominent decrease for nh3 n load when sweet potato is planted in spring scenario ii iii and vi similar pattern is observed for rice scenario iv v and vii there is a decrease trend in nh3 n load when rice is planted in spring which indicates planting sequence of crops have a double influence on nh3 n load to some extent further consideration about crop yields of these three crops using swat model the simulation accuracy of the results is not satisfactory with a high degree of uncertainty we are expanding and adjusting the parameter database gassman et al 2007 to improve the simulation results however due to the lack of more detailed data via field experiment sinnathamby et al 2017 further improvement of the simulation results is hindered numerous studies have indicated that mono cropping will easily lead to soil fertility decline microbial community degradation crop yield reduction and severe nps pollution which is called mono cropping obstacles wang et al 2018 contrary to mono cropping crop rotation can effectively avoid the obstacles of mono cropping ding et al 2018 planting sweet potato and rice in spring and peanut in autumn is better to ensure both cereal yields and economic benefit for farmers and agricultural manager which can also maximize the reduction of nh3 n load to achieve the sustainable development of water environment in the drb more management measures are needed to carry out to meet the nh3 n emission threshold such as applying fertilizer products properly and at an appropriate rate time and location zhang et al 2015 increasing nutrient recycling rates kh and yk 2019 georgianna and mayfield 2012 using conservation tillage approaches wang et al 2016 shao et al 2016 rusu and teodor 2014 and improving irrigation water management bastani and harter 2019 in this study because of a lack of detailed agricultural information only three crops rice peanut and sweet potato and their planting collocations were considered in addition the same chemical fertilizer was applied in the xia and the effects of different types of chemical fertilizers and the application amount of chemical fertilizer on agricultural nps pollution were not considered there is thus a need to conduct more simulations and experiments with more types of crops and different fertilizer applications in future studies to promote the prevention and control of agricultural nps pollution 5 conclusions a modelling approach allowed us to identify which should be the most preferable cropping system and its planting sequence to maximum the reduction of nh3 n load in the xia a typical intensive agricultural irrigation area in the drb of south china our findings indicated that there would reach a significant increase 28 3 distinct decrease 20 3 and slight decrease 4 6 in nh3 n load when peanuts sweet potato and rice were planted respectively in addition crop rotation could reduce the nh3 n load 5 25 and sp asp and sp ar planting sequence achieved the maximum reduction of nh3 n load which would provide references for suitable cropping system in drb a critical threshold of nh3 n emission 5 1 kg ha 1 year 1 in drb was proposed to effectively manage water pollution which stronger measures are needed to reduce agricultural nps pollution to meet the threshold declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

1332,although mixing and surface complexation reactions are key processes for solute transport in porous media their coupling has not been extensively investigated in this work we study the impact of mass transfer limitations on heterogeneous reactions taking place at the solid solution interface of a natural sandy porous medium under advection dominated flow through conditions a comprehensive set of 36 column experiments with different grain sizes 0 64 1 3 and 2 3 mm seepage velocities 1 30 and 90 m day and hydrochemical conditions were performed the injection of nabr solutions of different concentrations 1 100 mm led to the release of protons via deprotonation reactions of the quartz surface ph and solute concentration breakthrough curves were measured at the outlet of the columns and the propagation of ph fronts in the column setups was tracked inside the porous medium with non invasive optode sensors the experimental results show that the deprotonation of the reactive surfaces resulting from their interactions with the injected ionic species strongly depends on the hydrodynamic conditions and differs among the tested porous media despite their apparent similar surface properties reactive transport modeling was used to quantitatively interpret the experimental results and to analyze the effects of mass transfer limited physical processes on surface complexation reactions propagation of ph fronts transport of major ions and spatio temporal evolution of surface composition a dual domain mass transfer formulation ddmt combined with a surface complexation model scm allowed capturing the effects of incomplete mixing on the surface reactions and to reproduce the experimental observations collected in the experiments with high flow velocities the scm was parameterized with a single set of surface complexation parameters accounting for the similar surface properties of the porous media and was capable of describing the surface complexation mechanisms

interface li et al 2008 molins et al 2012 molins et al 2014 an accurate consideration of mixing processes and mass transfer limitations from pore to field scales is therefore of utmost importance to describe the transport of aqueous species in groundwater considering the difficulty in obtaining a sufficient resolution of the microscopic properties of natural porous media e g pore geometry and the high computational expense of pore scale simulations it is often necessary to describe pore scale mechanisms with macroscopic representations in particular macroscopic models based on continuum

mass transfer limitations on adsorption processes james and rubin 1979 valocchi 1985 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 darland and inskeep 1997 these investigations have focused on the impact of flow velocity and mass transfer processes in flow through systems but have been limited to simple sorption models isotherms ion exchange a rigorous description of the electrostatic properties at the solid solution interface is instead required to accurately capture the sorption behavior and the reactive transport of aqueous charged species including important inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals and metalloids stachowicz and hiemstra 2008 stolze et al 2019b therefore the coupling of comprehensive surface complexation models and mass transfer limited transport should be explored and tested silica sand is of particular interest for a variety of groundwater applications considering its ubiquity in the subsurface and its high permeability which can lead to incomplete mixing in presence of high groundwater flow velocities atchley et al 2014 jung and navarre sitchler 2018a muniruzzaman and rolle 2017 wen and li 2018 sand also exhibits a strong surface reactivity with protons and aqueous charged species which impacts pore water hydrochemistry kent and fox 2004 mcneece et al 2018 garcia et al 2019 stolze et al 2020 and potentially other solute mineral interactions in this study we investigate the effects of mass transfer limitations induced by incomplete mixing on surface complexation under flow through conditions by analyzing the propagation of acidic plumes and the transport of major ions in sandy porous media we performed a series of 36 column experiments by injecting salt solutions with different electrolyte nabr concentrations to trigger the deprotonation of the quartz sand surface the propagation of the aqueous species was monitored by measuring the concentration of the aqueous species at the outlet of the columns and by performing non invasive in situ measurements of the pore water ph the experiments were repeated using different grain sizes and flow velocities in order to test the influence of the porous medium granulometry and of the flow regime on mixing and mass transfer limitations a reactive transport model based on dual domain transport and on a description of the chemical and electrostatic surface complexation mechanisms in the sandy porous media was implemented to quantitatively interpret the experimental results 2 laboratory experiments flow through experiments were performed in cylindrical glass columns length 14 4 cm inner diameter 1 75 cm with a natural quartz sand originating from dorsten germany aquagran dry euroquartz the columns were wet packed with the porous medium to minimize entrapment of air in the pores haberer et al 2012 and connected to high precision peristaltic pumps ipc n24 coleparmer united states using two ports at each end of the columns continuous vertical injection from the bottom was applied to establish steady state laminar flow conditions the column experiments were initiated by flushing the domain with milli q water until steady ph conditions were reached i e ph 5 9 this allowed equilibrating the quartz sand surface with the initial pore water solution subsequently a nabr solution was injected as a step change from the bottom of the columns to alter the surface charge of the quartz via electrostatic interactions and thus to trigger a change in the quartz sand surface protonation as illustrated in fig 1 the experiments were performed with the same quartz sand but with i different average grain sizes 0 64 1 3 and 2 3 mm ii different concentrations of nabr electrolyte 0 1 1 10 and 100 mm and iii different seepage velocities 1 30 and 90 m day see table s1 in a comprehensive set of 36 flow

tracer tests artificial recharge delivery of reactants and or mixing enhancement for remediation e g manning and solomon 2005 magal et al 2010 kahler and kabala 2016 for all column experiments ph was measured at the outlet of the columns by connecting one of their outlet ports to 10 ml flow through vials equipped with ph probes hach intellical phc281 the ph was monitored with a time interval of 5 min for the experiments conducted with a seepage velocity of 1 m day and with a time interval of 10 s for the experiments conducted with seepage velocities of 30 and 90 m day subsequently the effluent ph breakthrough curves were calculated from the ph measurements using the continuous stirred tank reactor cstr to account for dilution effects in the flow through vial see supplementary material

concentrations were determined from unacidified samples using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 5000 thermoscientific during the experiments conducted with a seepage velocity of 1 m day non invasive high spatial resolution 5 mm spacing monitoring of pore water ph was performed along the axes of the columns using prototype optical ph luminescence based organic polymer sensors sf lg1 presens gmbh germany although these ph sensors are primarily designed for physiological applications this technique is here applied to geologic porous media in order to qualitatively track the ph front propagation along the column setup similar to the application of non invasive optode sensors to track the propagation of oxygen fronts haberer et al 2015 battistel et al 2019 ph sensor strips were glued onto the inner walls of the columns before packing the columns with sand ph spatial profiles were acquired at selected time intervals by using an optic fiber on the outer wall of the columns in the experiments performed at 1 m day with the highest ionic strength 100 mm nabr due to the sensitivity of the sensor that is best suited for a minimum ionic strength of 50 mm the parameters used for converting the optical measurements into ph values were directly calibrated by comparison between the optical sensors response and the measurements with an electrode in a flow through vial at the column outlet this was achieved by continuously monitoring the fluorescence lifetime of an optode sensor spot placed in the flow through vial used for measuring the ph breakthrough curve and referencing this signal to the ph determined with the electrode probe the optical sensors were also used in the column experiments performed with a seepage velocity of 30 m day with 100 mm nabr in which ph breakthrough curves were recorded at 3 spatial locations i e 3 6 7 2 10 5 cm from the inlet of the columns all experiments were conducted at 20 c and the aqueous solutions were prepared using milli q water before each column experiment the sand was first washed with hcl ph 4 and naoh ph 10 solutions and successively with a ph 2 solution to remove the remaining impurities and thoroughly rinsed with milli q water before packing the columns mcneece and hesse 2016 the applied flow rates were measured at the end of all column experiments porosity was determined for the different quartz sand grain sizes by fitting the breakthrough curves of the conservative anion bromide measured in column experiments performed at a seepage velocity of 1 m day table s2 the quartz sand surface areas were determined from samples collected before and after the column experiments with single and multi point bet sorption with n2 at 195 c 3 modeling approach numerical modeling of the column experiments was performed at the continuum scale considering the physical processes controlling solute transport and the surface complexation reactions at the surface of the sand grains 3 1 surface complexation reactions the interactions between the aqueous charged species and the sand surface were simulated with a surface complexation model the model explicitly considered both the quartz surface and a generic metal oxide surface i e accounting for the low fraction of fe 0 02 wt and al 0 007 wt coatings following the approach implemented in our previous study stolze et al 2020 specifically the quartz sand and metal oxides were described with a basic stern model stern 1924 grahame 1947 and a triple layer model yates et al 1974 davis james and leckie 1978 respectively both surfaces were represented with a single type of surface site having an amphoteric behavior i e including protonation and deprotonation reactions and capable to react with major ions na and br through the formation of outersphere complexes the latter are defined in the model β plane and account for ions that electrostatically interact with the surface to compensate the charge deficit or surplus of the model 0 plane which is determined by the surface protonation state fig 1 presents a schematic illustration of the electrostatic description of triple layer models the reactive surface areas of the generic metal oxide for the three different sand grain sizes considered in the present study were calibrated and the reactive surface area of the quartz was defined as aquartz abet aoxide 3 2 reactive transport equations reactive transport modeling was performed accounting for mass transfer limitations of aqueous solutes in the high flow velocity experiments 30 and 90 m day with a dual domain approach gottschlich 1963 coats and smith 1964 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 this approach consists in dividing the porous medium into a mobile domain in which advective and dispersive transport occurs and an immobile domain in which the fluid is considered stagnant and well mixed a schematic illustration of the ddmt approach is provided in the bottom right plot of fig 1 the transport of solutes in the saturated porous media

breakthrough curves collected in the 12 column experiments performed at the slow flow velocity of 1 m day including all tested ionic strengths of the injected solutions and all three grain sizes

algorithm pso method implemented in matlab was used to minimize the objective function 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results fig 2 displays the proton breakthrough curves measured at the outlet of the columns for all tested nabr concentrations grain diameters and seepage velocities the experimental results show the strong deprotonation of the quartz sand surface and the release of protons in the pore water induced upon the contact of the sand with the injected salt solution the injection of nabr solutions led to a steep increase of the proton concentrations at the outlet of the column after 1 pore volume followed by a more progressive decrease in proton concentrations towards the ph of the inlet solution ph 5 5 in all experiments remarkable differences in the elution of protons can be observed between the different tested conditions in particular the flow velocity and the grain sizes significantly impact the surface reactions under flow through conditions regarding the hydrochemical conditions the maximum concentration and amount of protons generated in the column experiments directly depended on the ionic strength of the inlet solutions with increasing concentrations of eluted protons corresponding to higher concentrations of nabr for instance in the experiments performed with a grain size diameter of 1 3 mm and a seepage velocity of 1 m day full line in fig 2e h the maximum proton concentration was 20 times higher when injecting a 100 mm nabr solution ch max 1 78 mm compared to a 0 1 mm nabr solution ch max 0 09 mm respectively this is also observed for the total amount of protons eluted e g nh tot 3 33 10 2 mmol and nh tot 5 63 10 3 mmol for these two particular column experiments comparison between proton breakthrough curves measured during experiments performed under similar transport and ionic strength conditions also showed that the dynamics and extent of the protons released from the sand surfaces were influenced by the sand grain size this impact was limited under low ionic strength conditions as shown by fig 2a e and i with similar maximum concentration of eluted protons e g concentrations in the range 0 089 0 093 mm for the three grain sizes under seepage velocity of 1 m day and 0 01 mm nabr but became more pronounced with increasing ionic strengths in particular the quartz sand with the smallest grain size led to the highest proton concentrations for instance with a seepage velocity of 1 m day and a nabr concentration of 100 mm nabr ch max was equal to 4 01 mm 1 78 mm and 2 18 mm for 0 64 mm 1 3 mm and 2 3 mm grain diameters respectively these differences are particularly interesting as they do not directly reflect the differences in bet surface area i e a2 3mm 0 32 m2 g a0 64mm 0 23 m2 g a1 3mm 0 15 m2 g and as all column experiments were performed with the same quartz sand in contrast the total amount of protons eluted from the column per unit of exposed surface area nh tot was similar at the low seepage velocity of 1 m day i e 3 12 10 3 3 83 10 3 3 08 10 3 mmol m2 abet for the experiments performed with 100 mm nabr with the 0 64 mm 1 3 mm and 2 3 mm grain diameters respectively demonstrating similar surface reactivity i e equal total pool of protons per unit exposed surface area for the different grain sizes these contrasting results demonstrate that specific properties of sand grain sizes e g different amount of coatings retarding the proton front and or different hydrodynamic properties of the considered porous media directly impacted the dynamics of the reaction between the ionic species and the reactive surface and therefore the shape of the proton breakthrough curves considering the transport conditions the results show that both the concentration and the total amount of eluted protons were strongly impacted by the applied flow rates for all grain sizes and under all ionic strength conditions higher seepage velocities lowered the release of protons i e full dashed and dash dotted lines corresponding to velocities of 1 30 and 90 m day in fig 2 furthermore the protons breakthrough curves measured in experiments performed with seepage velocities of 30 and 90 m day are nearly identical for average grain size diameters of 1 3 mm and 2 3 mm fig 2e l in contrast for grain diameter of 0 64 mm the proton breakthrough curves are markedly different for the 3 tested seepage velocities fig 2a d these results indicate that the grain size exerts a direct and important control on the degree of incomplete mixing of the injected aqueous solutes and their interaction with the reactive quartz surface under higher flow velocity and consequently on the release of h from the quartz surface in addition to the ph breakthrough curves we measured spatial ph profiles at different times using prototypes optical sensor strips fig 3 shows the ph spatial profiles for the different grain sizes during the salt injections performed at high ionic strength 100 mm nabr and under a flow velocity of 1 m day for all experiments the propagation of the proton fronts can be clearly identified from the profiles measured at 1 and 2 h i e before flushing 1 pv during the salt injections the transport of h is characterized by a sharp front followed by a gentle slope of the profile after 3 h the measurements show the sluggish recovery of ph within the column pore water in agreement with the ph breakthroughs observed at the outlet vials solid lines in fig 2d h and l non invasive in situ ph measurements were also performed in the column experiments carried out with a flow velocity of 30 m day and inlet solution with an ionic strength of 100 mm nabr to track the propagation of the ph fronts under such high flow velocity optical sensors were placed at three fixed locations along the column i e 3 6 7 2 and 10 5 cm from the inlet fig 4 displays the ph breakthrough curves measured at these locations within the porous media using the non invasive optode technique for the three different tested grain sizes the ph breakthrough curve shows a sharp decrease in proton concentrations when the acidic plume reaches the location of the sensor in agreement with the h breakthrough curve measured at the outlet of the columns with the ph sensor fig 2 however these measurements provide additional information about the dynamics of the h plume formation in fact fig 4 clearly shows a progressive increase in proton concentrations at the front of the plume as the latter progresses within the porous media towards the outlet of the columns this pattern results from the increasing amount of quartz sand surface that reacts as the nabr plume propagates along the column leading to an accumulation of protons at the front of the plume where the quartz surface deprotonation reaction is highest the impacts of the ionic strength transport condition and grain size diameter on the release of protons are summarized in fig 5 in order to remove the effects of surface area differences among the tested quartz grains the maximum concentration of protons measured at the outlet of the column left panels in fig 5 and the total amount of protons eluted after 10 pv right panels in fig 5 were normalized by the measured bet surface area exposed in the respective experiments the strong impact of flow velocity on the release of protons is clearly visible in fig 5 this is both expressed by the substantial decrease in the maximum concentration of protons measured at the columns outlets fig 5a d and the total amount of protons released from the porous media for a given number of pore volume flushed fig 5e h when increasing the flow velocity fig 5 highlights significant differences in the interactions between the aqueous species and the reactive surface for the different sand grains used in the experiments in particular the maximum concentration of h per unit surface area is significantly higher for the smaller grain sizes fig 5d whereas the larger grain size consistently shows lower proton concentration maxima green bars in fig 5a d furthermore the relative decrease in maximum h concentration when increasing the flow velocity increases with the grain sizes e g 58 71 and 82 for grain sizes 0 64 mm 1 3 mm and 2 3 mm and an inlet solution with 100 mm nabr when increasing the flow velocity from 1 to 30 m day differently from the maximum concentration of protons measured at the column outlets the total amount of eluted protons fig 5e h is very similar for the three grain sizes in the low seepage velocity experiments and in particular for the experiments performed with higher concentration of nabr i e 10 and 100 mm in fig 5g and h respectively such similarity reflects the common surface properties i e equal total pool of protons per unit exposed surface area of the grain sizes although the intermediate grain size systematically shows slightly higher total amount of eluted protons red bars in fig 5e h this slight difference suggests lower buffering capacity of the metal oxide coatings for the intermediate grain size and becomes increasingly more pronounced at higher flow velocity e g case at 100 mm nabr fig 5h the experimental results obtained under broad ranges of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions indicate that the dynamics and extent of the reaction between the dissolved ionic species and the solid surface are significantly influenced by a complex interplay between grain size specific properties flow velocities and incomplete mixing in the pore channels 4 2 modeling results at slow flow velocity the surface complexation parameters were calibrated using the experimental dataset of the column experiments performed with the slow seepage velocity 1 m day and assuming local physical equilibrium i e no ddmt included in the model fig 6 displays the comparison between simulated and measured proton breakthrough curves for the 12 experiments performed at 1 m day the model allowed reproducing the proton breakthrough curves measured for all tested grain sizes and injected solutions with a single set of surface complexation parameters table 1 in particular the model captures the dynamics of the proton concentrations that peak after 1 pv and the dependency of the maximum proton concentration on the specific ionic strength conditions i e more proton generated under higher ionic strength conditions for all grain sizes additional simulations were performed by individually inhibiting the contribution of some specific mechanisms i e surface complexation reactions with metal oxide coatings and by testing the impact of the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion supplementary material the outcomes of these simulations revealed that the difference in proton release from the different porous media during the experiment performed with a seepage velocity of 1 m day primarily results from the distinct amount of oxide coatings among the different grain sizes considered fig s3 the presence of these oxides and the protonation of their surface sites buffer the increase in the pore water acidity resulting from the deprotonation of the quartz surface the lower amount of oxide in the coatings of the sand of intermediate grain size table 1 could explain the systematic higher total amount of eluted protons compared to the smaller and larger gain size fig 5 furthermore the model shows that as a result of the increase in the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion term with increasing grain size i e eq 3 the average grain diameter has a secondary but substantial impact on the maximum concentration of protons in fact lower longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion led to lower spreading of the proton plumes and thus sharper proton fronts exhibiting higher h concentration maxima the model could also capture the transport of ionic species as shown by the agreement between the simulation outcomes and the measured breakthrough curves of sodium and bromide in fig 7 the breakthrough curves of ionic species show that the transport behavior of sodium and bromide differ bromide exhibits a conservative pattern in all flow through experiments whereas sodium is significantly retarded in particular for experiments performed with lower concentrations of injected nabr fig 7a b 7e f and 7i j the retardation of sodium can be explained by the formation of sodium outersphere complexes on the quartz surface this surface complexation mechanism leads to the release of protons for charge conservation both at the mineral surface i e negative charge of the surface is compensated by the positive charge of sodium and in the pore water i e negative charge of chloride compensated by the released protons and by the sodium remaining in solution the apparent lack of retardation of sodium in the breakthrough for the experiment performed with inlet solutions of highest ionic strength fig 7d h and l is caused by the presence of sodium in great excess relative to the adsorption capacity of the reactive sand surface 4 3 modeling results at high flow velocity impact of incomplete mixing and mass transfer limitations fig 8 presents the comparison of the simulated and measured proton breakthrough curves for column experiments performed at higher flow velocity i e 30 and 90 m day the simulations were performed using the set of surface complexation parameters determined in the 1 m day experiments and by accounting for mass transfer limitations induced by the fast flow using a ddmt approach as shown by the solid lines in fig 8 the reactive transport model based on a ddmt approach could satisfyingly reproduce the measured proton breakthrough curves and capture the decrease in h concentration when increasing the flow velocity for all tested grain sizes and ionic strengths these results demonstrate the capability of the model to describe the complex transport behavior of the aqueous species observed at fast flow velocities by accounting for mass transfer limitations and surface complexation in contrast the model that did not include the ddmt formulation thus not accounting for the effect of mass transfer limitations on the transport of aqueous species and surface reactions significantly overestimated the concentrations of protons at the column outlets for all experiments dashed lines in fig 8 the differences between proton breakthrough curves for flow velocities of 30 m day and 90 m day are particularly clear for the smallest and largest grain sizes fig 8a d and 8i l whereas both the simulations and the experimental dataset did not indicate a decrease in eluted protons between the highest tested flow velocities for the intermediate grain size fig 8e h table 2 lists the values of the ddmt parameters fitted to reproduce the measured proton breakthrough curves the calibrated ddmt parameters reflect the specific mass transfer limited behavior observed in the different porous media when increasing the flow velocity in particular the fraction of reactive surface area allocated to the immobile domain φ im increases with increasing grain sizes for the 30 m day cases and is higher than that for the mobile domain under all tested hydrodynamic conditions the correlation between φ im and the grain size is not observed for the 90 m day case as φ im only increases for the smaller grain size when changing the flow velocity from 30 to 90 m day whereas φ im remains stable for the two other grain sizes furthermore the mass transfer coefficient ξ increases with flow velocity which is in agreement with previous studies e g liu and kitanidis 2012 the calibrated reactive transport models allowed the analysis of the spatio temporal evolution of the injected solutes and the release of protons from the reactive sand surface fig 9 displays the simulated changes in protons and sodium concentrations in the mobile and immobile domains for the experiments performed with a grain size diameter of 0 64 mm and a 10 mm nabr inlet solution for all tested velocities proton concentrations progressively increase towards the outlet fig 9a e in particular for the fast flow velocity cases in the mobile domain the protons released from the sand surface travel as a wave characterized by a sharp front and a long tailing during the first pore volume flushed fig 9a b and d this wave of protons forms as h accumulates at the front of the plume with the advancement of the injected sodium along the column and its contact with a progressively larger amount of reactive surface fig 9f g and i more specifically the change in surface composition simulated by the surface complexation model indicates that it is the deprotonation of the quartz surface upon adsorption of sodium via electrostatic interaction that leads to the acidification of the pore water fig 9k t for instance fig 9k and r show that the uptake of sodium via the formation of outer sphere complexes is mirrored by the decrease in protonated sites fig 9 clearly shows the impact of incomplete mixing on the evolution of the proton plume with lower concentration of released protons in the mobile fraction of the pore water when increasing the seepage velocity fig 9a b and d these model results also reveal important differences between the mobile and immobile domains in the evolution of the hydrochemical and surface compositions in particular the aqueous h and na concentrations profiles are broader and h concentration is significantly higher in the immobile domain e g fig 9c and e compared to fig 9a b and d for protons such model outcome reflects the mass transfer limitations between the mobile and immobile domains and provides insights on the effect of incomplete mixing on the sorption and transport behavior of aqueous charged species in particular the low volume surface ratio in the immobile domain leads to the build up of high proton concentrations and the slow mass transfer from the immobile to the mobile domain results in more pronounced tailing conversely the higher volume surface ratio in the mobile domain leads to lower h concentrations and the continuous replacement of the pore water due to the injection of the inlet solution leads to a rapid elution of the proton wave and to sharper h profiles the concentration of h in the immobile domain decreases with time fig 9c and e as h diffuses into the mobile domain and is subsequently eluted from the column differently na concentration remains steady throughout the entire domain i e mobile and immobile fig 9f j as sodium is continuously injected from the column inlet regarding the evolution of the surface composition the change in surface composition is more regular in the immobile domain e g fig 9m compared to the mobile domain where the highest changes in surface composition occur in the vicinity of the column inlet e g fig 9l finally the larger surface concentrations in the immobile domain fig 9m o r and t reflect the low volume surface ratio in this model region 5 conclusions the impact of mass transfer limitations is of fundamental importance for the transport of aqueous solutes as it determines the degree of reaction not only between dissolved species but also for solutes undergoing chemical and electrostatic interactions at the solid solution interface in this study we have considered the deprotonation of the quartz surface as an example of surface complexation reaction in saturated porous media we performed flow through experiments and reactive transport simulations to investigate the effects of mass transfer limitations on surface deprotonation induced by the injection of electrolyte solutions the experiments were carried out with different grain sizes seepage velocities and electrolyte concentrations to explore the physical and hydrochemical factors controlling the interactions between aqueous solutes and reactive mineral surfaces a dual domain mass transfer formulation combined with a surface complexation model was adopted to reproduce the experiments performed at the high seepage velocities and to capture the effects of mass transfer limitations on the transport of protons and injected ions the experimental and modeling results show that incomplete mixing can affect both the extent and the dynamics of surface complexation reactions during the transport of aqueous charged species under advection dominated conditions consequently such physical mass transfer limitations exert a substantial control on the reactive transport behavior in the flow through systems in particular an increase in seepage velocity substantially hampers surface complexation reactions i e lowering the maxima of eluted proton concentration due to mass transfer limited transport of the aqueous solutes from the pore water to the reactive surface porous media of larger grain size and presenting larger pore throats lead to a higher degree of incomplete mixing at fast flow velocities and consequently a more pronounced decrease in surface reactivity furthermore the experimental and modeling results reveal that the difference in the amount of coatings in natural porous media as well as in the hydrodynamic dispersion among grain sizes can lead to a surface reactivity that does not linearly correlate with the measured surface area of the grains the comprehensive experimental dataset reported in this study can be used to test different formulations of solute transport affected by heterogeneous reactions which only apparently are not mixing controlled in fact the outcomes of these experiments show that surface complexation reactions under fast flow regimes become mass transfer limited due to incomplete mixing in the pore channels the collected dataset could be of interest to test more complex models including multiple immobile continua and or first principle pore scale simulations solving stokes flow and advection diffusion reaction equations in solid liquid domains the investigations performed in this study could also be extended to multidimensional 2 d and 3 d systems where incomplete mixing is particularly important at the lateral fringes of injected plumes ye et al 2015a chiogna et al

1332,although mixing and surface complexation reactions are key processes for solute transport in porous media their coupling has not been extensively investigated in this work we study the impact of

of 36 column experiments with different grain sizes 0 64 1 3 and 2 3 mm seepage velocities 1 30 and 90 m day and hydrochemical conditions were performed the injection of nabr solutions of different

the propagation of ph fronts in the column setups was tracked inside the porous medium with non invasive optode sensors the experimental results show that the deprotonation of the reactive surfaces

interface li et al 2008 molins et al 2012 molins et al 2014 an accurate consideration of mixing processes and mass transfer limitations from pore to field scales is therefore of utmost importance to describe the transport of aqueous species in groundwater considering the difficulty in obtaining a sufficient resolution of the microscopic properties of natural porous media e g pore geometry and the high computational expense of pore scale simulations it is often necessary to describe pore scale mechanisms with macroscopic representations in particular macroscopic models based on continuum

2019a fakhreddine et al 2020 wallis et al 2020 however the coupling of surface complexation and mixing processes has received limited attention only a few contributions have assessed the impact of mass transfer limitations on adsorption processes james and rubin 1979 valocchi 1985 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 darland and inskeep 1997 these investigations have focused on the impact of flow velocity and mass transfer processes in flow through systems but have been limited to simple sorption models isotherms ion exchange a rigorous description of the electrostatic properties at the solid solution interface is instead required to accurately capture the sorption behavior and the reactive transport of aqueous charged species including important inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals and metalloids stachowicz and hiemstra 2008 stolze et al 2019b therefore the coupling of comprehensive surface complexation models and mass transfer limited transport should be explored and tested silica sand is of particular interest for a variety of groundwater applications considering its ubiquity in the subsurface and its high permeability which can lead to incomplete mixing in presence of high groundwater flow velocities atchley et al 2014 jung and navarre sitchler 2018a muniruzzaman and rolle 2017 wen and li 2018 sand also exhibits a strong surface reactivity with protons and aqueous charged species which impacts pore water hydrochemistry kent and fox 2004 mcneece et al 2018 garcia et al 2019 stolze et al 2020 and potentially other solute mineral interactions in this study we investigate the effects of mass transfer limitations induced by incomplete mixing on surface complexation under flow through conditions by analyzing the propagation of acidic plumes and the transport of major ions in sandy porous media we performed a series of 36 column experiments by injecting salt solutions with different electrolyte nabr concentrations to trigger the deprotonation of the quartz sand surface the propagation of the aqueous species was monitored by measuring the concentration of the aqueous species at the outlet of the columns and by performing non invasive in situ measurements of the pore water ph the experiments were repeated using different grain sizes and flow velocities in order to test the influence of the porous medium granulometry and of the flow regime on mixing and mass transfer limitations a reactive transport model based on dual domain transport and on a description of the chemical and electrostatic surface complexation mechanisms in the sandy porous media was implemented to quantitatively interpret the experimental results 2 laboratory experiments flow through experiments were performed in cylindrical glass columns length 14 4 cm inner diameter 1 75 cm with a natural quartz sand originating from dorsten germany aquagran dry euroquartz the columns were wet packed with the porous medium to minimize entrapment of air in the pores haberer et al 2012 and connected to high precision peristaltic pumps ipc n24 coleparmer united states using two ports at each end of the columns continuous vertical injection from the bottom was applied to establish steady state laminar flow conditions the column experiments were initiated by flushing the domain with milli q water until steady ph conditions were reached i e ph 5 9 this allowed equilibrating the quartz sand surface with the initial pore water solution subsequently a nabr solution was injected as a step change from the bottom of the columns to alter the surface charge of the quartz via electrostatic interactions and thus to trigger a change in the quartz sand surface protonation as illustrated in fig 1 the experiments were performed with the same quartz sand but with i different average grain

concentrations were determined from unacidified samples using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 5000 thermoscientific during the experiments conducted with a seepage velocity of 1 m day non invasive high spatial resolution 5 mm spacing monitoring of pore water ph was performed along the axes of the columns using prototype optical ph luminescence based organic polymer sensors sf lg1 presens gmbh germany although these ph sensors are primarily designed for physiological applications this technique is here applied to geologic porous media in order to qualitatively track the ph front propagation along the column setup similar to the application of non invasive optode sensors to track the propagation of oxygen fronts haberer et al 2015 battistel et al 2019 ph sensor strips were glued onto the inner walls of the columns before packing the columns with sand ph spatial profiles were acquired at selected time intervals by using an optic fiber on the outer wall of the columns in the experiments performed at 1 m day with the highest ionic strength 100 mm nabr due to the sensitivity of the sensor that is best suited for a minimum ionic strength of 50 mm the parameters used for converting the optical measurements into ph values were directly calibrated by comparison between the optical sensors response and the measurements with an electrode in a flow through vial at the column outlet this was achieved by continuously monitoring the fluorescence lifetime of an optode sensor spot placed in the flow through vial used for measuring the ph breakthrough curve and referencing this signal to the ph determined with the electrode probe the optical sensors were also used in the column experiments performed with a seepage velocity of 30 m day with 100 mm nabr in which ph breakthrough curves were recorded at 3 spatial locations i e 3 6 7 2 10 5 cm from the inlet of the columns all experiments were conducted at 20 c and the aqueous solutions were prepared using milli q water before each column experiment the sand was first washed with hcl ph 4 and naoh ph 10 solutions and successively with a ph 2 solution to remove the remaining impurities and thoroughly rinsed with milli q water before packing the columns mcneece and hesse 2016 the applied flow rates were measured at the end of all column experiments porosity was determined for the different quartz sand grain sizes by fitting the breakthrough curves of the conservative anion bromide measured in column experiments performed at a seepage velocity of 1 m day table s2 the quartz sand surface areas were determined from samples collected before and after the column experiments with single and multi point bet sorption with n2 at 195 c 3 modeling approach numerical modeling of the column experiments was performed at the continuum scale considering the physical processes controlling solute transport and the surface complexation reactions at the surface of the sand grains 3 1 surface complexation reactions the interactions between the aqueous charged species and the sand surface were simulated with a surface complexation model the model explicitly considered both the quartz surface and a generic metal oxide surface i e accounting for the low fraction of fe 0 02 wt and al 0 007 wt coatings following the approach implemented in our previous study stolze et al 2020 specifically the quartz sand and metal oxides were described with a basic stern model stern 1924 grahame 1947 and a triple layer model yates et al 1974 davis james and leckie 1978 respectively both surfaces were represented with a single type of surface site having an amphoteric behavior i e including protonation and deprotonation reactions and capable to react with major ions na and br through the formation of outersphere complexes the latter are defined in the model β plane and account for ions that electrostatically interact with the surface to compensate the charge deficit or surplus of the model 0 plane which is determined by the surface protonation state fig 1 presents a schematic illustration of the electrostatic description of triple layer models the reactive surface areas of the generic metal oxide for the three different sand grain sizes considered in the present study were calibrated and the reactive surface area of the quartz was defined as aquartz abet aoxide 3 2 reactive transport equations reactive transport modeling was performed accounting for mass transfer limitations of aqueous solutes in the high flow velocity experiments 30 and 90 m day with a dual domain approach gottschlich 1963 coats and smith 1964 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 this approach consists in dividing the porous medium into a mobile domain in which advective and dispersive transport occurs and an immobile domain in which the fluid is considered stagnant and well mixed a schematic illustration of the ddmt approach is provided in the bottom right plot of fig 1 the transport of solutes in the saturated porous media

experiments 3 3 numerical implementation simulations of the column experiments were performed with the geochemical code phreeqc 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 coupled with matlab by using the iphreeqc module charlton and parkhurst 2011 muniruzzaman and rolle 2016 this approach allowed combining the geochemical multicomponent transport and dual porosity model capabilities of phreeqc with the computational methods of matlab in particular the latter was used to parallelize the simulations of multiple experiments to conduct automated calibration of model parameters and to perform a comprehensive analysis of the data and model outcomes e g stolze et al 2019b murray et al 2019 the 1d domain representing the column setup was discretized into 50 grid cells x 2 88 mm the aqueous

calibration strategy calibration of the model parameters was performed in two successive steps first the surface complexation parameters were calibrated using the laboratory dataset i e h na and br breakthrough curves collected in the 12 column experiments performed at the slow flow velocity of 1 m day including all tested ionic strengths of the injected solutions and all three grain sizes subsequently the ddmt parameters were calibrated based on the eluted h breakthrough curves measured in the 24 experiments performed at higher flow velocities i e 12 columns at 30 m day and 12 columns at 90 m day in this step the surface complexation parameters were fixed to the values determined from the slow flow velocity experiments a visual illustration of the calibration approach is provided in the supplementary material fig s3 modeling of the flow through experiments and calibration of the model parameters for a given subset of experiments i e low and fast flow experiments respectively were performed simultaneously by running in parallel the reactive transport simulations regarding the ddmt parameters two mass transfer coefficients ξ for the respective seepage velocities used in the experiments i e 30 and 90 m day were optimized the scaling coefficient φ im was calibrated individually among 6 subsets each composed of 4 experiments performed with equal flow velocities and grain sizes the immobile porosity θ im was set to 0 02 based on a previous laboratory study in homogeneous porous media with similar granulometry muniruzzaman and rolle 2017 the global search particle swarm algorithm pso method implemented in matlab was used to minimize the objective function 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results fig 2 displays the proton breakthrough curves measured at the outlet of the columns for all tested nabr concentrations grain diameters and seepage velocities the experimental results show the strong deprotonation of the quartz sand surface and the release of protons in the pore water induced upon the contact of the sand with the injected salt solution the injection of nabr solutions led to a steep increase of the proton concentrations at the outlet of the column after 1 pore volume followed by a more progressive decrease in proton concentrations towards the ph of the inlet solution ph 5 5 in all experiments remarkable differences in the elution of protons can be observed between the different tested conditions in particular the flow velocity and the grain sizes significantly impact the surface reactions under flow through conditions regarding the hydrochemical conditions the maximum concentration and amount of protons generated in the column experiments directly depended on the ionic strength of the inlet solutions with increasing concentrations of eluted protons corresponding to higher concentrations of nabr for instance in the experiments performed with a grain size diameter of 1 3 mm and a seepage velocity of 1 m day full line in fig 2e h the maximum proton concentration was 20 times higher when injecting a 100 mm nabr solution ch max 1 78 mm compared to a 0 1 mm nabr solution ch max 0 09 mm respectively this is also observed for the total amount of protons eluted e g nh tot 3 33 10 2 mmol and nh tot 5 63 10 3 mmol for these two particular column experiments comparison between proton breakthrough curves measured during experiments performed under similar transport and ionic strength conditions also showed that the dynamics and extent of the protons released from the sand surfaces were influenced by the sand grain size this impact was limited under low ionic strength conditions as shown by fig 2a e and i with similar maximum concentration of eluted protons e g concentrations in the range 0 089 0 093 mm for the three grain sizes under seepage velocity of 1 m day and 0 01 mm nabr but became more pronounced with increasing ionic strengths in particular the quartz sand with the smallest grain size led to the highest proton concentrations for instance with a seepage velocity of 1 m day and a nabr concentration of 100 mm nabr ch max was equal to 4 01 mm 1 78 mm and 2 18 mm for 0 64 mm 1 3 mm and 2 3 mm grain diameters respectively these differences are particularly interesting as they do not directly reflect the differences in bet surface area i e a2 3mm 0 32 m2 g a0 64mm 0 23 m2 g a1 3mm 0 15 m2 g and as all column experiments were performed with the same quartz sand in contrast the total amount of protons eluted from the column per unit of exposed surface area nh tot was similar at the low seepage velocity of 1 m day i e 3 12 10 3 3 83 10 3 3 08 10 3 mmol m2 abet for the experiments performed with 100 mm nabr with the 0 64 mm 1 3 mm and 2 3 mm grain diameters respectively demonstrating similar surface reactivity i e equal total pool of protons per unit exposed surface area for the different grain sizes these contrasting results demonstrate that specific properties of sand grain sizes e g different amount of coatings retarding the proton front and or different hydrodynamic properties of the considered porous media directly impacted the dynamics of the reaction between the ionic species and the reactive surface and therefore the shape of the proton breakthrough curves considering the transport conditions the results show that both the concentration and the total amount of eluted protons were strongly impacted by the applied flow rates for all grain sizes and under all ionic strength conditions higher seepage velocities lowered the release of protons i e full dashed and dash dotted lines corresponding to velocities of 1 30 and 90 m day in fig 2 furthermore the protons breakthrough curves measured in experiments performed with seepage velocities of 30 and 90 m day are nearly identical for average grain size diameters of 1 3 mm and 2 3 mm fig 2e l in contrast for grain diameter of 0 64 mm the proton breakthrough curves are markedly different for the 3 tested seepage velocities fig 2a d these results indicate that the grain size exerts a direct and important control on the degree of incomplete mixing of the injected aqueous solutes and their interaction with the reactive quartz surface under higher flow velocity and consequently on the release of h from the quartz surface in addition to the ph breakthrough curves we measured spatial ph profiles at different times using prototypes optical sensor strips fig 3 shows the ph spatial profiles for the different grain sizes during the salt injections performed at high ionic strength 100 mm nabr and under a flow velocity of 1 m day for all experiments the propagation of the proton fronts can be clearly identified from the profiles measured at 1 and 2 h i e before flushing 1 pv during the salt injections the transport of h is characterized by a sharp front followed by a gentle slope of the profile after 3 h the measurements show the sluggish recovery of ph within the column pore water in agreement with the ph breakthroughs observed at the outlet vials solid lines in fig 2d h and l non invasive in situ ph measurements were also performed in the column experiments carried out with a flow velocity of 30 m day and inlet solution with an ionic strength of 100 mm nabr to track the propagation of the ph fronts under such high flow velocity optical sensors were placed at three fixed locations along the column i e 3 6 7 2 and 10 5 cm from the inlet fig 4 displays the ph breakthrough curves measured at these locations within the porous media using the non invasive optode technique for the three different tested grain sizes the ph breakthrough curve shows a sharp decrease in proton concentrations when the acidic plume reaches the location of the sensor in agreement with the h breakthrough curve measured at the outlet of the columns with the ph sensor fig 2 however these measurements provide additional information about the dynamics of the h plume formation in fact fig 4 clearly shows a progressive increase in proton concentrations at the front of the plume as the latter progresses within the porous media towards the outlet of the columns this pattern results from the increasing amount of quartz sand surface that reacts as the nabr plume propagates along the column leading to an accumulation of protons at the front of the plume where the quartz surface deprotonation reaction is highest the impacts of the ionic strength transport condition and grain size diameter on the release of protons are summarized in fig 5 in order to remove the effects of surface area differences among the tested quartz grains the maximum concentration of protons measured at the outlet of the column left panels in fig 5 and the total amount of protons eluted after 10 pv right panels in fig 5 were normalized by the measured bet surface area exposed in the respective experiments the strong impact of flow velocity on the release of protons is clearly visible in fig 5 this is both expressed by the substantial decrease in the maximum concentration of protons measured at the columns outlets fig 5a d and the total amount of protons released from the porous media for a given number of pore volume flushed fig 5e h when increasing the flow velocity fig 5 highlights significant differences in the interactions between the aqueous species and the reactive surface for the different sand grains used in the experiments in particular the maximum concentration of h per unit surface area is significantly higher for the smaller grain sizes fig 5d whereas the larger grain size consistently shows lower proton concentration maxima green bars in fig 5a d furthermore the relative decrease in maximum h concentration when increasing the flow velocity increases with the grain sizes e g 58 71 and 82 for grain sizes 0 64 mm 1 3 mm and 2 3 mm and an inlet solution with 100 mm nabr when increasing the flow velocity from 1 to 30 m day differently from the maximum concentration of protons measured at the column outlets the total amount of eluted protons fig 5e h is very similar for the three grain sizes in the low seepage velocity experiments and in particular for the experiments performed with higher concentration of nabr i e 10 and 100 mm in fig 5g and h respectively such similarity reflects the common surface properties i e equal total pool of protons per unit exposed surface area of the grain sizes although the intermediate grain size systematically shows slightly higher total amount of eluted protons red bars in fig 5e h this slight difference suggests lower buffering capacity of the metal oxide coatings for the intermediate grain size and becomes increasingly more pronounced at higher flow velocity e g case at 100 mm nabr fig 5h the experimental results obtained under broad ranges of hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions indicate that the dynamics and extent of the reaction between the dissolved ionic species and the solid surface are significantly influenced by a complex interplay between grain size specific properties flow velocities and incomplete mixing in the pore channels 4 2 modeling results at slow flow velocity the surface complexation parameters were calibrated using the experimental dataset of the column experiments performed with the slow seepage velocity 1 m day and assuming local physical equilibrium i e no ddmt included in the model fig 6 displays the comparison between simulated and measured proton breakthrough curves for the 12 experiments performed at 1 m day the model allowed reproducing the proton breakthrough curves measured for all tested grain sizes and injected solutions with a single set of surface complexation parameters table 1 in particular the model captures the dynamics of the proton concentrations that peak after 1 pv and the dependency of the maximum proton concentration on the specific ionic strength conditions i e more proton generated under higher ionic strength conditions for all grain sizes additional simulations were performed by individually inhibiting the contribution of some specific mechanisms i e surface complexation reactions with metal oxide coatings and by testing the impact of the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion supplementary material the outcomes of these simulations revealed that the difference in proton release from the different porous media during the experiment performed with a seepage velocity of 1 m day primarily results from the distinct amount of oxide coatings among the different grain sizes considered fig s3 the presence of these oxides and the protonation of their surface sites buffer the increase in the pore water acidity resulting from the deprotonation of the quartz surface the lower amount of oxide in the coatings of the sand of intermediate grain size table 1 could explain the systematic higher total amount of eluted protons compared to the smaller and larger gain size fig 5 furthermore the model shows that as a result of the increase in the longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion term with increasing grain size i e eq 3 the average grain diameter has a secondary but substantial impact on the maximum concentration of protons in fact lower longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion led to lower spreading of the proton plumes and thus sharper proton fronts exhibiting higher h concentration maxima the model could also capture the transport of ionic species as shown by the agreement between the simulation outcomes and the measured breakthrough curves of sodium and bromide in fig 7 the breakthrough curves of ionic species show that the transport behavior of sodium and bromide differ bromide exhibits a conservative pattern in all flow through experiments whereas sodium is significantly retarded in particular for experiments performed with lower concentrations of injected nabr fig 7a b 7e f and 7i j the retardation of sodium can be explained by the formation of sodium outersphere complexes on the quartz surface this surface complexation mechanism leads to the release of protons for charge conservation both at the mineral surface i e negative charge of the surface is compensated by the positive charge of sodium and in the pore water i e negative charge of chloride compensated by the released protons and by the sodium remaining in solution the apparent lack of retardation of sodium in the breakthrough for the experiment performed with inlet solutions of highest ionic strength fig 7d h and l is caused by the presence of sodium in great excess relative to the adsorption capacity of the reactive sand surface 4 3 modeling results at high flow velocity impact of incomplete mixing and mass transfer limitations fig 8 presents the comparison of the simulated and measured proton breakthrough curves for column experiments performed at higher flow velocity i e 30 and 90 m day the simulations were performed using the set of surface complexation parameters determined in the 1 m day experiments and by accounting for mass transfer limitations induced by the fast flow using a ddmt approach as shown by the solid lines in fig 8 the reactive transport model based on a ddmt approach could satisfyingly reproduce the measured proton breakthrough curves and capture the decrease in h concentration when increasing the flow velocity for all tested grain sizes and ionic strengths these results demonstrate the capability of the model to describe the complex transport behavior of the aqueous species observed at fast flow velocities by accounting for mass transfer limitations and surface complexation in contrast the model that did not include the ddmt formulation thus not accounting for the effect of mass transfer limitations on the transport of aqueous species and surface reactions significantly overestimated the concentrations of protons at the column outlets for all experiments dashed lines in fig 8 the differences between proton breakthrough curves for flow velocities of 30 m day and 90 m day are particularly clear for the smallest and largest grain sizes fig 8a d and 8i l whereas both the simulations and the experimental dataset did not indicate a decrease in eluted protons between the highest tested flow velocities for the intermediate grain size fig 8e h table 2 lists the values of the ddmt parameters fitted to reproduce the measured proton breakthrough curves the calibrated ddmt parameters reflect the specific mass transfer limited behavior observed in the different porous media when increasing the flow velocity in particular the fraction of reactive surface area allocated to the immobile domain φ im increases with increasing grain sizes for the 30 m day cases and is higher than that for the mobile domain under all tested hydrodynamic conditions the correlation between φ im and the grain size is not observed for the 90 m day case as φ im only increases for the smaller grain size when changing the flow velocity from 30 to 90 m day whereas φ im remains stable for the two other grain sizes furthermore the mass transfer coefficient ξ increases with flow velocity which is in agreement with previous studies e g liu and kitanidis 2012 the calibrated reactive transport models allowed the analysis of the spatio temporal evolution of the injected solutes and the release of protons from the reactive sand surface fig 9 displays the simulated changes in protons and sodium concentrations in the mobile and immobile domains for the experiments performed with a grain size diameter of 0 64 mm and a 10 mm nabr inlet solution for all tested velocities proton concentrations progressively increase towards the outlet fig 9a e in particular for the fast flow velocity cases in the mobile domain the protons released from the sand surface travel as a wave characterized by a sharp front and a long tailing during the first pore volume flushed fig 9a b and d this wave of protons forms as h accumulates at the front of the plume with the advancement of the injected sodium along the column and its contact with a progressively larger amount of reactive surface fig 9f g and i more specifically the change in surface composition simulated by the surface complexation model indicates that it is the deprotonation of the quartz surface upon adsorption of sodium via electrostatic interaction that leads to the acidification of the pore water fig 9k t for instance fig 9k and r show that the uptake of sodium via the formation of outer sphere complexes is mirrored by the decrease in protonated sites fig 9 clearly shows the impact of incomplete mixing on the evolution of the proton plume with lower concentration of released protons in the mobile fraction of the pore water when increasing the seepage velocity fig 9a b and d these model results also reveal important differences between the mobile and immobile domains in the evolution of the hydrochemical and surface compositions in particular the aqueous h and na concentrations profiles are broader and h concentration is significantly higher in the immobile domain e g fig 9c and e compared to fig 9a b and d for protons such model outcome reflects the mass transfer limitations between the mobile and immobile domains and provides insights on the effect of incomplete mixing on the sorption and transport behavior of aqueous charged species in particular the low volume surface ratio in the immobile domain leads to the build up of high proton concentrations and the slow mass transfer from the immobile to the mobile domain results in more pronounced tailing conversely the higher volume surface ratio in the mobile domain leads to lower h concentrations and the continuous replacement of the pore water due to the injection of the inlet solution leads to a rapid elution of the proton wave and to sharper h profiles the concentration of h in the immobile domain decreases with time fig 9c and e as h diffuses into the mobile domain and is subsequently eluted from the column differently na concentration remains steady throughout the entire domain i e mobile and immobile fig 9f j as sodium is continuously injected from the column inlet regarding the evolution of the surface composition the change in surface composition is more regular in the immobile domain e g fig 9m compared to the mobile domain where the highest changes in surface composition occur in the vicinity of the column inlet e g fig 9l finally the larger surface concentrations in the immobile domain fig 9m o r and t reflect the low volume surface ratio in this model region 5 conclusions the impact of mass transfer limitations is of fundamental importance for the transport of aqueous solutes as it determines the degree of reaction not only between dissolved species but also for solutes undergoing chemical and electrostatic interactions at the solid solution interface in this study we have considered the deprotonation of the quartz surface as an example of surface complexation reaction in saturated porous media we performed flow through experiments and reactive transport simulations to investigate the effects of mass transfer limitations on surface deprotonation induced by the injection of electrolyte solutions the experiments were carried out with different grain sizes seepage velocities and electrolyte concentrations to explore the physical and hydrochemical factors controlling the interactions between aqueous solutes and reactive mineral surfaces a dual domain mass transfer formulation combined with a surface complexation model was adopted to reproduce the experiments performed at the high seepage velocities and to capture the effects of mass transfer limitations on the transport of protons and injected ions the experimental and modeling results show that incomplete mixing can affect both the extent and the dynamics of surface complexation reactions during the transport of aqueous charged species under advection dominated conditions consequently such physical mass transfer limitations exert a substantial control on the reactive transport behavior in the flow through systems in particular an increase in seepage velocity substantially hampers surface complexation reactions i e lowering the maxima of eluted proton concentration due to mass transfer limited transport of the aqueous solutes from the pore water to the reactive surface porous media of larger grain size and presenting larger pore throats lead to a higher degree of incomplete mixing at fast flow velocities and consequently a more pronounced decrease in surface reactivity furthermore the experimental and modeling results reveal that the difference in the amount of coatings in natural porous media as well as in the hydrodynamic dispersion among grain sizes can lead to a surface reactivity that does not linearly correlate with the measured surface area of the grains the comprehensive experimental dataset reported in this study can be used to test different formulations of solute transport affected by heterogeneous reactions which only apparently are not mixing controlled in fact the outcomes of these experiments show that surface complexation reactions under fast flow regimes become mass transfer limited due to incomplete mixing in the pore channels the collected dataset could be of interest to test more complex models including multiple immobile continua and or first principle pore scale simulations solving stokes flow and advection diffusion reaction equations in solid liquid domains the investigations performed in this study could also be extended to multidimensional 2 d and 3 d systems where incomplete mixing is particularly important at the lateral fringes of injected plumes ye et al 2015a chiogna et al

1333,dry wells gravity fed infiltration wells have frequently been used to recharge aquifers with stormwater especially in urban areas as well as manage flood risk and reduce surface water body contamination from stormwater pollutants however only limited assessment of their potential adverse impacts on groundwater quality exists dry well recharge can bypass significant portions of the filtering capacity of the vadose zone stormwater and groundwater monitoring data and analysis of transport of a wide range of historic and current use stormwater chemicals of concern is lacking to address these gaps two dry wells were constructed with vegetated and structural pretreatment features to assess the likelihood of stormwater contaminants reaching the aquifer we monitored assessed and compared the presence of contaminants in stormwater to water quality in the vadose zone and shallow groundwater after it passed through the dry well the dry wells were installed at a suburban residential and at a suburban commercial site the selected sites were overlying a regional unconsolidated and highly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer system stormwater vadose zone and groundwater samples were collected during five storms and analyzed for over 200 contaminants of concern relatively few contaminants were detected in stormwater generally at low concentrations prior to stormwater entering the dry well 50 65 of contaminants were removed by vegetated pretreatment in groundwater metals such as aluminum and iron were detected at similar concentrations in both upgradient and downgradient wells suggesting the source of these metals was not dry well effluent naturally occurring metals such as chromium and arsenic were not detected in stormwater but were found at elevated concentrations in groundwater a modeling assessment suggests that the travel time of metals and hydrophobic organic contaminants to the water table at these sites ranges from years to centuries whereas water soluble pesticides would likely reach the water table within days to months the modeling assessment also showed that more vulnerable sites with higher fraction of alluvial sands would have much shorter contaminant travel times however none of the contaminants assessed reached concentrations that pose a risk to human health across the scenarios considered no evidence was found either through direct measurements or vadose zone modeling that contaminants present in suburban stormwater degraded or would degrade groundwater quality at the studied sites and site conditions future work is needed to address emerging contaminants of concern keywords stormwater infiltration dry wells groundwater quality vadose zone modeling aquifer recharge urban stormwater quality 1 introduction the necessity of water resources stewardship has been brought into sharper focus by the impacts of climate change over the past decade in many parts of the world more extreme weather events such as flooding and drought have motivated water managers as well as local and state government agencies to re examine water management policies and practices chauhan et al 2021 dillon et al 2019 in the united states of america for example the impacts of drought and climate change on the availability of water resources have led to the adoption of the sustainable groundwater management act in california legislation enacted to minimize overdraft and work toward sustainable groundwater use http groundwater ucdavis edu sgma urban stormwater is one source of water for recharge but there are a number of challenges to optimizing its use in some areas a low permeable subsurface e g clay may prevent or limit recharge dry wells large diameter vertical perforated pipes can penetrate these barriers and release water into more permeable units within the vadose zone closer to the aquifer however concerns about groundwater contamination have prevented dry wells from being widely used in some areas nasem 2015 metals pesticides and organics may be entrained in runoff as it flows over the land surface masoner et al 2019 stein et al 2006 tiefenthaler et al 2008 infiltration of this runoff through dry wells releases the pollutants closer to the aquifer diminishing the attenuation role of the unsaturated zone apart from managing recharge dry wells are also used to reduce runoff to and pollution of urban creeks clark and pitt 2007 nrc 2009 a variety of low impact development practices including bioretention cells swales and infiltration basins have been adopted to prevent contaminated stormwater from adversely affecting waterways and aquatic life askarizadeh et al 2015 however due to the presence of low permeability surface soils and near surface sediments in many arid locations these practices can be ineffective at infiltrating stormwater dry wells are an alternative method to enhance infiltration by allowing water to bypass low permeability layers and facilitating the movement of stormwater into more permeable units of the subsurface given the general lack of data and analysis of potential contamination from dry wells regulators and water managers are sometimes hesitant to support their use there are relatively few scientific studies that have evaluated the risk of groundwater contamination associated with dry well use most of them having been performed over 20 years ago edwards et al 2016 the few longer term 5 years studies that have been performed have indicated that dry wells did not result in appreciable aquifer contamination dallman and spongberg 2012 jurgens et al 2008 in some cases existing groundwater contamination was diluted by the infiltrating stormwater lasgrwc 2010 pretreatment chambers that capture sediment and associated metals and organics have been reported to be effective at significantly reducing the concentration of contaminants prior to runoff entering the dry well wilson et al 1989 clark and pitt 2007 additionally the composition of the vadose zone can have a significant impact on attenuation of metals and organics some contaminants will sorb strongly in clay layers while unconsolidated sand and gravel layers have limited attenuation capacity bandeen 1987 wogsland 1988 wilson et al 1989 much of our current knowledge is based on site specific reports that address specific regulatory requirements while rigorous comprehensive scientific experiments are lacking studies have analyzed stormwater or groundwater quality but not both some did not include upgradient and downgradient groundwater monitoring wells lindemann 1999 adolfson associates 1995 olson 1987 barraud et al 1999 wogsland 1988 while some long term stormwater and groundwater analysis exist for a broad range of contaminants wilson et al 1989 dallman and spongberg 2012 most are limited in the scope of contaminants investigated or in the duration of the period of analysis several recent studies have employed vadose zone modeling to quantify dry well performance in terms of stormwater infiltration rates and volumes but these studies did not model stormwater contaminant transport liang et al 2018 sasidharan et al 2018 sasidharan et al 2019 qi et al 2020 only one previous study used modeling to assess risks associated with dry well use but it did not include any field monitoring bandeen 1987 the goal of this study was to perform an integrated monitoring and assessment study that simultaneously considers performance of stormwater pretreatment on water quality and potential impacts on the vadose zone and shallow groundwater with respect to over 200 contaminants of interest within two representative urban settings we installed dry wells with pretreatment and an associated monitoring networks at an urban residential site and at an urban commercial site monitoring included observation of stormwater prior to pretreatment prior to entering the dry well in the vadose zone adjacent to the dry well and both upgradient and downgradient of the dry well in groundwater observations occurred over a two year period we analyzed for several contaminant groups including metals volatile and semi volatile organics and also for current use pesticides pyrethroids a vadose flow and transport assessment using hydrus was performed to assess potential long term impacts of the monitoring data collected and their implication for other sites overlying unconsolidated alluvial sediments to our knowledge this is the first study that includes pyrethroids a widely used class of pesticides commonly detected in urban stormwater sampling in california amweg et al 2006 and the first study to consider fipronil and imidacloprid stormwater contaminants of emerging concern this is also the first comprehensive modeling assessment to expand on necessarily intermediate term site specific experimental results across the pretreatment dry well vadose zone groundwater continuum 2 material and methods 2 1 dry well system and setting two dry wells and associated monitoring well networks were constructed at two locations in elk grove california in the united states elk grove is in the sacramento valley which is the northernmost watershed in california s central valley and has a mediterranean climate with distinct annual wet and dry seasons precipitation normally occurs between the months of october and may with an average annual rainfall of 47 04 cm noaa 2010 the drought that began in california during 2012 persisted through 2014 2015 and 2016 the years during which the drywell field study occurred elk grove received approximately 17 8 cm of precipitation during the 2014 water year 39 4 cm during the 2015 water year and 37 6 cm during the 2016 water year weather underground 2016 elk grove lies between the cosumnes and sacramento rivers and the geology of the area is characterized by fluvial sediment deposition that creates unconsolidated interbedded layers consisting of lenses of gravel sand silt clay and various mixtures of the three meirovitz et al 2017 the groundwater system underlying the elk grove area is consequently semi confined with the aquifers occurring in sand and gravel layers and the finer grained layers serving as confining beds or aquitards county wide shallow aquifer water table depths have historically ranged from 6 1 m to 21 3 m below land surface department of water resources 1997 each dry well was 1 m m wide and 14 m deep one dry well was constructed at the strawberry detention basin sdb located within a 70 0 ha ha residential neighborhood stormwater at this site was collected from a single family residential community which included a local high school with large areas of turf the site of the second dry well was the city s corporation yard cy a 0 26 ha drainage shed that serves as a bus fleet servicing maintenance and parking facility runoff that drained to this dry well system was collected from the rooftop of an office maintenance building and the hardscape of the expansive bus parking lot each dry well consisted of a drilled borehole 1 1 m in diameter containing a 0 76 m diameter cylindrical polypropylene casing approximately 13 7 m deep with 2 5 cm cm perforations along its length a 10 cm diameter pvc stilling pipe capped at the top and open at the dry well bottom perforated with 1 3 cm diameter holes spaced at 13 cm intervals on two sides of the pipe was placed within the casing the void space between the polypropylene casing and the stilling pipe was filled with 6 mm mm diameter pea gravel as was the annular space between the borehole wall and the casing both dry wells were completed at least 2 5 m above the seasonal high water table fig 1 the monitoring wells located upgradient and downgradient of the dry wells were completed at the water table monitoring wells were 6 cm in diameter and were completed at 76 m bgs at the cy and 58 m bgs at sdb at sdb the upgradient well was mw3 while at the cy it was mw1 fig 2 shows the locations of the monitoring wells in comparison to the dry wells at each site these wells were fitted with pressure transducers to determine the depth to the water table and estimate the local groundwater gradients a vadose zone well mw2 was also constructed 4 6 and 7 6 m downgradient of each dry well during the rainy season the screen on mw2 at sdb was actually below the water table so it functioned as a fourth water table well the dry well system was composed of three parts a vegetated pretreatment feature designed to remove suspended solids and associated pollutants a structural pretreatment feature a sedimentation chamber that provided additional treatment and the dry well itself fig 1 at sdb the vegetated feature was an existing water quality basin containing small trees shrubs and grass while at the cy a deep grassy swale was constructed to detain water for up to 10 min prior to entering the sedimentation well the sedimentation chambers were approximately 1 5 m deep and 0 76 m in diameter the pipes connecting the sedimentation chambers to the dry wells were placed approximately 0 5 m from the bottom of the chambers due to insufficient depth and pipe inlet height stormwater did not have sufficient residence time in the sedimentation chambers to permit most sediment and associated pollutants to settle therefore pretreatment was performed primarily by the vegetated features each dry well was approximately 13 5 m deep and was completed 4 5 sdb and 9 cy meter above the water table at both sites clay layers composed significant portions of the lithology 27 at the cy and 45 at sdb at the cy there was a meter of clayey material between the bottom of the dry well and the water table 2 2 stormwater monitoring stormwater samples were collected five times over a two year period when storm precipitation totals were 6 4 mm or greater and when there was less than 2 54 mm of rain during the preceding 72 h the water year at our locations begins in october with the onset of winter rains most precipitation stops in march but can extend into april or may the study was conducted during two water years with below average rainfall 26 7 cm in the first year and 34 3 cm in the second normal rainfall for the region is 46 cm during each rain event runoff was collected at two locations at each site as indicated by the red arrows in fig 1 the stormwater samples were collected in pre cleaned bottles every 15 60 min depending on the intensity and duration of the rain event and placed on ice total volume of stormwater runoff was measured at each site then an algorithm was used to select samples for preparing the flow weighted composites appropriate volumes from each collection bottle were added to a large carboy reflecting 80 of the runoff volume mixed then aliquoted into appropriate vials for analytical chemistry total storm runoff volumes and representative flow rates were calculated using the areas of orifices or holes in a stand pipe that controlled the volume of water entering the sedimentation chamber each orifice could be plugged so that stormwater could enter the sedimentation chamber only through the open hole different sized orifices were associated with different flow rate based on lab calibration testing in addition to these samples during two rain events composite samples were collected at the stormwater outfall or curb cut green arrow fig 1 additional grab samples were collected at curb cut storm drain outfall during all other rain events during the second wet season of the study monitoring occurred during the first storm event of the water year in order to capture the first flush of contaminants water samples were analyzed for over 200 contaminants at a local epa and elap certified environmental laboratory accreditation program laboratory employing standard methods for sample bottle preparation chain of custody and reporting of both detection and reporting limits for all analytes contaminants for analysis were chosen based on the frequency of their detection in local stormwater samples as well as recommendations from local and state stormwater managers as well as reports of emerging contaminants they included total suspended solids us epa 160 2 pyrethroid pesticides california dept fish wildlife water pollution control laboratory method 53 chlorophenoxy herbicides us epa 8151a total petroleum hydrocarbons and motor oil us epa 8015 diesel and gas pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons us epa 8310 semi volatile organics us epa 625 volatile organics us epa 8260b 25 metals and trace elements measured as dissolved metals us epa 200 series and hexavalent chromium when indicated us epa 200 series general physical constituents such as turbidity and colour us epa stdm general mineral constituents including chloride nitrate and sulfate us epa stdm total coliform us epa sm 9221 and glyphosate final monitoring event only field blanks field blank duplicates and field duplicates were also collected to control for field contamination and reproducibility of collection methods laboratory quality assurance included analysis of matrix spike and matrix spike duplicates as well as laboratory control samples data was reported for the detection and reporting limits but only results above the reporting limits were used for statistical analysis 2 3 groundwater and vadose zone monitoring groundwater samples were collected from groundwater and vadose zone monitoring wells prior to the construction of the dry wells to characterize ambient groundwater quality one to two days after the five storm sampling events from the vadose zone well and two to seven days after the rain event from the groundwater wells additionally groundwater samples were collected after the completion of each wet season the timing of wet season collections was informed by water level data from pressure transducers installed in some of the wells samples were analyzed for the same set of contaminants measured in stormwater all groundwater samples that were used for analysis of metals were filtered in the field thus the analysis reflects dissolved concentrations this was not the case for other stormwater samples which were not filtered outside of this difference all other samples were collected in the same manner 2 4 statistical methods non parametric statistics were used to analyze contaminant data because the data were not normally distributed helsel 2005 contaminant concentrations at the sites of sample collections were compared to assess the relationships between concentrations in stormwater collected as it entered the dry well system after pretreatment in the vadose zone and in the upgradient and downgradient water table well samples censored data was recoded by subtracting non detects from a constant higher than the maximum concentration for each contaminant prior to statistical analysis helsel 2005 the kruskal wallis test was used for those contaminants with a single analytical reporting limit a statistically derived number that was between two and ten fold greater than the minimum detection limit if significance was identified p 0 05 the concentrations of contaminants at each study site were ranked then tukey s test of honestly significant differences was used to identify differences between groups by analyzing differences in ranks not the actual values tukey s test substituted for bonferroni s correction for type i errors limits the false discovery rate helsel 2005 for those contaminants with two or greater reporting limits generalized wilcoxon tests were performed gehan test a variation of the generalized wilcoxon test used to determine whether two group percentiles are the same or if one is higher than the other was used to identify differences between groups helsel 2005 correlation analysis was performed on data used to investigate redox couples and ion exchange reactions in the subsurface all statistical analyses were performed using statistica tibco software inc palo alto ca usa 2 5 vadose zone contaminant transport modeling given the relatively short two year period of this study the long term risks to groundwater quality associated with dry well use could not be assessed from groundwater monitoring alone numerical modeling analysis was used to estimate potential long term effects we sought to determine the breakthrough time of 1 of the contaminant s input concentration the time at which the contaminant would reach any existing regulatory levels and the peak concentration at the water table after 500 years of infiltration for each contaminant at each dry well site for a range of subsurface conditions chemical transport parameters and contaminant input concentrations the one dimensional vadose zone water flow and solute transport modeling software hydrus 1d was used to model the vertical transport of select contaminants in infiltrating stormwater through the subsurface domain representing the length between the bottom of the dry well and the site s seasonal high water table known as the separation distance at each site šimůnek et al 2013 1d rather than 2d or 3d modeling was deemed appropriate because of the laterally extensive layered structures of the vadose zone sediments at these sites which are also typical of the california central valley and many other sedimentary basins specifically the lateral extent of the sediment layers representing coarse and fine grained hydrofacies e g sands gravels silts clays in the study area have been estimated to be about 100 m to 400 m meirovitz et al 2017 maples et al 2019 making more complex 2d or 3d flow patterns due to laterally discontinuous layering unlikely at these vadose zone sites this strong horizontal stratification is also reflected in the stratigraphic cross sections shown in fig 3 in other words although the subsurface in the region is highly heterogeneous in 3d at the kilometers scale at the scale of these vadose zone sites and due to the strong tendency for vertical flow to dominate in the vadose zone we concluded a 1d modeling would be both appropriate and most likely to represent a direct pathway to the water table i e a worst case scenario hydrus 1d was used to obtain travel times and contaminant concentrations at the water table to gain insight into the case where the silt and clay layers that impede flow are missing two hypothetical coarse grained sites in los angeles were also modeled stormwater contaminants detected during field testing were selected for the modeling based on their frequency of detection and toxicity input contaminant concentrations were calculated from the results of the stormwater quality sampling analyses further fipronil and imidacloprid two pesticides that were not analyzed for in site stormwater but whose presence has been detected in urban stormwater with increased frequency were also included in the model their input concentrations were based on data obtained from the california department of pesticide regulation the amount of water coming into the domain was determined from the results of groundwater stage analyses water and solutes were input at the top of the model domain and allowed to drain freely from the bottom which represented the elevation of the seasonal high water table the hydrus 1d domains were created using lithologic cross sections created for each study site fig 3 these cross sections were created using lithologic logs obtained during the drilling of monitoring wells the sediment layers between the dry well bottom and the seasonal high water table were estimated from the cross sections and the textural classifications and layer thicknesses were duplicated in the hydrus 1d domain sediment profiles the cy domain was 9 75 m in length and composed of seven layers of sediment from top to bottom 70 cm of clay 165 cm of silty sand 60 cm of sandy silty clay 60 cm of silty clay 285 cm of sand 85 cm of silty clay and 250 cm of sandy silt the sdb domain was 2 78 m in length and composed of two layers from top to bottom 150 cm of sandy silty clay and 128 cm of sand the time variable boundary conditions were determined based on the results of the stormwater sampling the results of the dissolved concentration calculations and the stage records for each dry well site the water flow boundary condition bc at the top of both model domains is variable pressure head and flux and the solute transport bc at the top of both model domains is concentration flux the bottom water flow bcs are free drainage i e zero gradient boundary conditions here we chose the free drainage boundary condition to represent worst case most downward flux flow and transport conditions typical of conditions when the water table is lower than the seasonal high position chosen to represent the bottom of the domain the bottom solute transport bc for both domains is zero concentration gradient which in effect accomplishes a specified solute flux that is a function of the water velocity and the computed concentration at the boundary but does not account for the effect of dispersion across the boundary the latter can be shown to contribute negligibly to the overall solute flux under the simulated conditions the top water flow and solute transport bcs are time variable a 365 day record of daily pressure head or flux and contaminant concentration in the influent water was created for each drywell site the cy model time variable bc is a constant pressure head of 400 cm for 230 days and 0 flux for the remaining 135 days repeated each year the sdb model domain s upper water flow boundary condition is a constant pressure head of 300 cm for 215 days and 0 flux for the remaining 150 days repeated each year the time variable bcs were determined based on the results of the stormwater sampling the results of the dissolved concentration calculations and the stage records for each drywell site the heads of 400 cm and 300 cm represent the average pressure head stage during the wet season for the 2016 water year contaminant concentration remains constant over time in influent water for both sites the annual boundary condition time series is repeated as needed for each model run to capture the full breakthrough curve of each contaminant under each scenario model run time periods range from one year to many years depending on the transport parameters of the modeled contaminant the group of contaminants selected for modeling were those that were regularly reported in stormwater monitoring at either of the two study sites or were newer generation pesticides regularly detected in urban stormwater monitoring in by the california department of pesticide regulation 2016 input variables specified for the modeling included sediment hydraulic properties and contaminant chemical properties that affect transport the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the lowest hydraulic conductivity layer was estimated using field data and the rosetta dynamically linked library neural network accessed through hydrus 1d was used to estimate the ks of the other sediments based on their textural classification schaap et al 2001 literature sources were used to determine values for subsurface chemical parameters and for all contaminant transport parameters because of uncertainty in both the subsurface hydraulic and chemical conditions and the transport characteristics of the selected contaminants eight sensitivity scenarios were run for each of the chosen contaminants at each site the variables that were changed to create the eight scenarios selected due to site variability were contaminant input concentration ks and fraction organic carbon foc values for organic contaminants or soil water partitioning coefficient kd values for metals the ks values were calculated from actual site conditions foc and kd values were obtained from relevant literature allison and allison 2005 baes et al 1984 interstate technology and regulatory council 2015 office of air and radiation usepa 1999 sheppard and sohlenius 2009 strenge and peterson 1989 the worst case scenario conditions were modeled using total contaminant concentrations in stormwater high ks values and low foc or kd values maximizing the input concentration of contaminants and the movement of those contaminants through the vadose zone the most likely case was modeled using the mobile fraction of each contaminant the dissolved concentration which was calculated from total concentration using the relevant partition coefficient see table 1 and table 2 for selected values of soil hydraulic properties and contaminant transport parameters for the cy and sdb sites respectively the kd value for an organic contaminant is dependent on the fraction organic carbon foc of the sediment the contaminant is moving through to capture this variability in the model the foc values used for clay and silt sediments were varied between 0 01 or 0 001 and 0 001 or 0 0001 for sands interstate technology and regulatory council 2015 in addition to the two elk grove sites modeling was performed for two theoretical sites in los angeles california united states of america the sacramento region within which the city of elk grove is located as well as the greater california central valley are known for the presence of clay and silt layers interbedded with the aquifer sediments given the capacity of clay to bind many contaminants there was concern that elk grove modeling results could suggest a greater protection of groundwater than might be found in other parts of the state or country where sand can compose significant portions of the unsaturated zone further the diversity and concentration of contaminants could be larger than what might be seen in a suburban area such as elk grove modeled sites in the los angeles metropolitan area were used to fill this gap stormwater contaminants and concentrations for the los angeles area were determined from stormwater quality literature and sediment hydraulic and chemical properties were sourced from relevant literature allison and allison 2005 baes et al 1984 interstate technology and regulatory council 2015 office of air and radiation usepa 1999 sheppard and sohlenius 2009 stein et al 2006 strenge and peterson 1989 tiefenthaler et al 2008 see table 3 for selected values of soil hydraulic properties and contaminant transport parameters for the theoretical dry well sites in los angeles the foc values used for the la domain were 0 005 for clay 0 001 for sandy loam and loam and 0 0001 for sand parameter values were not modified between model runs as the two sediment profiles created for the los angeles numerical analysis already represent theoretical average and worst case subsurface scenarios 2 6 analysis of desorption of arsenic and chromium arsenic and chromium are naturally occurring toxic metals present in geologic formations in the sacramento region gama 2021 to investigate the possibility that constituents such as salts or metals in stormwater could cause desorption and solubilization of either of these toxic metals a preliminary analysis of the relationship between ion and redox couples in groundwater was performed concentrations of arsenic chromium and numerous ions were assessed as part of stormwater and groundwater quality analysis comparisons between upgradient and downgradient concentration of arsenic and chromium at the water table were made and correlation analysis of redox couples was performed 3 results 3 1 stormwater infiltration rates and volumes estimates of cumulative annual stormwater volumes infiltrated through each dry well were obtained using the results of orifice flow measurements taken during sampled storm events as well as dry well stage data gathered from pressure transducers the total volumes of stormwater infiltrated through the cy and sdb dry wells during the 2016 water year were estimated to be approximately 246 7 cubic meters m3 and 863 4 m3 respectively the sdb dry well received approximately 3 5 times greater volumes of influent stormwater per storm event than the cy dry well did this is because the sdb dry well receives stormwater from an area of approximately 70 ha compared to the cy dry well s paved 0 26 ha surface the infiltration rates at sdb were on average 12 7 cubic meters h m3 h considerably higher than the 7 2 m3 h measured at the cy factors accounting for this disparity include differences in the volumes of water entering the dry well causing differences in head as well as differences in vadose zone composition see fig 3 3 2 stormwater and groundwater quality contaminants that were detected in stormwater samples followed similar patterns based on their origin anthropogenic contaminants such as the pyrethroid bifenthrin aluminum and iron typically had elevated concentrations in stormwater which declined to varying degree as runoff passed through the vegetated pretreatment feature fig 4 panels a b and c none were detected above the reporting limit in groundwater among the organic compounds analyzed pyrethroid pesticides and motor oil were detected most frequently of the nine pyrethroids measured bifenthrin was detected at the highest concentrations primarily at the sdb fig 4a however bifenthrin was not detected in any of the groundwater samples the average concentration of bifenthrin declined by about 50 as stormwater passed through the pretreatment features while the median concentration in groundwater was below the reporting limit of the other pesticides measured a single chlorophenoxy herbicide dalaphon in groundwater only and glyphosate in stormwater only were each detected once in both cases the concentrations were below the relevant regulatory standard most volatile organics were not detected in stormwater some volatiles including toluene acetone and tert butyl alcohol tba were identified near the reporting limit and below the regulatory standard acetone was detected once at 300 μg l in stormwater entering the cy swale but the concentration fell by 50 after pretreatment acetone was not quantifiable in groundwater because its concentration was below the reporting limit at sdb acetone was occasionally noted in stormwater at low levels and once just above the reporting limit in a downgradient groundwater monitoring well data not shown not suprisingly motor oil was detected in stormwater at both sites but at a ten fold higher concentration at the cy than at the sdb median values 1 2 vs 0 11 mg l respectively pretreatment resulted in a three fold or greater reduction in concentration none was found in groundwater samples at either site metals measured as dissolved in water were frequently detected in stormwater and groundwater at both sites for example the concentration of aluminum in influent stormwater was 3 mg l at the cy three times the mcl but fell to 1 mg l after pretreatment fig 4b the second most commonly detected metal was iron fig 4c exceedances of the secondary regulatory standard for taste and odor were found at both sites for influent stormwater and stormwater measured after pretreatment although the concentrations were considerably reduced after pretreatment in contrast to these pollutants a completely different pattern of detections was observed for naturally occuring metals such as arsenic fig 4d and chromium data not shown concentrations in stormwater were not detectable while concentrations in groundwater were elevated in both upgradient and downgradient wells these differences were statistically significant in the case of arsenic over the two year study period concentrations of both metals were elevated in the summer dry season and declined during the rainy season likely due to dilution caused by the infiltration of stormwater no significant increase of arsenic or chromium concentrations were observed downgradient of the dry well compared to the upgradient well suggesting mobilization of metals during the two year study period did not occur when data from all groundwater samples at both sites was pooled no significant correlations were found between arsenic and sulfate bicarbonate or manganese the single exception to this pattern was a weak positive correlation between arsenic and iron p 0 056 mobilization due to competing effects could not be excluded and therefore further monitoring of common competing anions such as phosphate silicate or vanadate is needed no significant correlation was found between chromium and manganese data not shown despite the fact that manganese oxides are recognized as the major viable oxidants which oxidize insoluble trivalent chromium to soluble hexavalent chromium under a range of environmental conditions eary and rai 1987 guha et al 2001 nitrate is the single water soluble constituent that can be toxic at high concentrations 10 mg l no 3 n us epa regulatory standard nitrate concentrations were detectable in stormwater and groundwater exceeding the regulatory standard in groundwater at both sites fig 5 it was notable that at the cy samples from the upgradient water table monitoring well had a significantly higher concentration than samples from the two downgradient wells suggesting that stormwater might have actually diluted nitrate concentrations 3 3 estimate of the effectiveness of pretreatment the concentrations of a subset of contaminants for which there were detectable quantities and that have varied chemical properties were compared before and after pretreatment table 4 the change in concentration was used as an estimate of the effectiveness of the grassy swale or water quality basin at removing pollutants the different types of vegetated pretreatment a grassy swale at the cy vs a water quality basin with varied vegetation at sdb were reflected in the different degrees of contaminant reduction the change in total suspended sediment which adsorbs many organics and metals was 63 at the cy and 50 at sdb the estimate of removal efficiency is likely most valid for total suspended solids due to the larger sample size 3 4 vadose zone modeling corporation yard the contaminants selected for modeling at the cy and the sdb were a combination of those detected in stormwater at each location and two pesticides of emerging concern fipronil and imidacloprid in the most likely scenario modeled for the cy site table 4 the input concentration for half of the contaminants modeled was so low that the groundwater concentration would not exceed the reporting limit within the modeling timeframe of 500 years contaminants that fell into this group included aluminum di ethyl hexyl phthalate dehp and permethrin a commonly used pyrethroid for example aluminum was predicted to arrive at the water table at a concentration 1 of its input concentration after 265 years but would be unlikely to reach the analytical reporting limit due to its low input concentration in contrast fipronil and iron were predicted to arrive at the water table at measurable concentrations after 6 and 18 years respectively a third group of contaminants those that are water soluble reached the water table over the course of days to weeks for example imidacloprid and tert butyl alcohol tba were shown to reach quantifiable levels after 85 and 129 days respectively the worst case scenario high hydraulic conductivity and high solubility of the contaminant results for the cy site modeling showed most contaminants reach reporting limits at the water table after a period of days to years table 4 the rate of transport of aluminum was slow it would likely take hundreds of years to reach the water table the other modeled metals and pyrethroids moved more rapidly through the vadose zone reaching the water table in between 5 and 17 years the water soluble contaminants would reach reporting limits at the water table between 10 and 133 days included in table 5 for comparison are the results of running a conservative tracer through the model domains all chemical parameters for the conservative tracer were set to 0 to represent transport through the domain without any retardation dispersion or degradation 3 5 vadose zone modeling strawberry detention basin a slightly different group of contaminants were modeled at the sdb than at the cy reflecting differences in pollutants detected table 6 the ubiquitous pyrethroid pesticide bifenthrin was regularly measured at elevated concentrations in stormwater at sdb given its hydrophobicity it was the least mobile of all those modeled at sdb predicted to take about 470 years to reach a reportable concentration at the water table under the average case scenario the concentration would likely reach about 3 ng l after 500 years while using worst case scenario assumptions the concentration would reach its influent concentration of 99 ng l in 5 years at sdb under the average case scenario the water soluble contaminants are predicted to have greatly reduced transport times imidacloprid and fipronil were shown to reach the water table in about three months and seven years respectively tba was shown to take fewer than 20 days of travel time all the other monitored contaminants are never shown to reach sufficiently high concentrations to be reportable the worst case scenario results at the sdb site differed from the cy in that all contaminants would likely reach reportable concentrations in less than 50 years table 6 most notably imidcacloprid and tba were shown to reach the aquifer in 3 days and fipronil in 18 days 3 6 vadose zone modeling los angeles a different group of contaminants drawn from regional stormwater data were modeled for the hypothetical los angeles california usa scenarios the pollutant list included contaminants such as benzo a pyrene naphthalene and zinc that were frequently reported in the stormwater literature from the los angeles region tiefenthaler et al 2008 stein et al 2006 the average scenario modeling results indicated that all but one of the contaminants would not reach concentrations above criteria values table 7 four contaminants were predicted to reach the water table at detectable concentrations within 15 years copper fipronil imidacloprid and naphthalene after 15 years 3 years 34 days and 188 days respectively in contrast under the worst case scenario modeling showed that contaminants reach the water table much more rapidly and achieved higher concentrations than estimated for the average case table 7 for example benzo a pyrene b a p traveled through the unsaturated zone which was 80 sand in three months compared to 250 years in the average case scenario close to a 1000 fold difference similar comparisons can be made for copper where a greater than 200 fold difference was calculated a 90 fold difference for lead and bifenthrin the most hydrophobic of the modeled contaminants was predicted to never reach a reportable value compared to a 48 day travel time in the worst case scenario it appeared that the greater the hydrophobicity of the contaminant the larger the contrast between the influence of the two subsurface profiles on transport time however with the two water soluble pesticides the differences were considerably less it is worth noting that with the exception of b a p none of the concentrations of contaminants reached their respective criteria values e g mcl phg or other benchmark 4 discussion 4 1 contaminants in stormwater the presence of contaminants in stormwater in the united states has been widely documented for over 50 years the concern regarding stormwater has historically been focused on the adverse impacts on aquatic life a large body of literature exists on the classes sources and effects of contaminants on aquatic life brown and peake 2006 kuivila et al 2012 weston and lydy 2012 budd et al 2015 pitt et al 1999 maestre and pitt 2006 however more recently additional concerns regarding the harmful effects of stormwater contaminants on groundwater has been the focus of considerable interest due to efforts to infiltrate stormwater to reduce the effects of hydromodifications on urban waterways as well as use it as a source of groundwater replenishment nrc 2009 given the history of groundwater contamination associated with industrial and commercial site and on military installations and the lack of nationwide information the united states geologic survey conducted a comprehensive study of 50 runoff events at over 20 sites in the united states their data showed that stormwater entrains pesticides pharmaceuticals pahs as well as a variety of industrial and household chemicals masoner et al 2019 of the 438 organic chemicals analyzed their average detection rate was greater than 70 in contrast to findings of masoner and others we found surprisingly few organic contaminants detected in stormwater samples at the two study sites in elk grove fewer than 10 of the contaminants analyzed at any one sampling event were be detected above their reporting limit this appears to be due to a few factors one is the fact that most of the contaminant analysis was performed on samples collected after pretreatment due to the high cost of analytical chemistry on only two occasions were untreated stormwater samples collected most were collected at the dry well after pretreatment had occurred so it was expected that the concentrations of contaminants would be lower than untreated runoff however even the two untreated stormwater samples contained fewer than 10 contaminants above their reporting limits the two study sites a residential neighborhood and at a bus parking servicing area are common urban land uses that have been associated to varying degrees with contaminated stormwater ssqp 2017 maestre and pitt 2006 stein et al 2006 influent stormwater at these sites contained few polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons e g pyrene fluoranthene phthalates and benzo a pyrene and volatile organics e g carbon tetrachloride chloroform and toluene in contrast pyrethroid total petroleum hydrocarbons and metals were regularly detected the low frequency of detections could under report the actual frequency because of the small sample size given that the first year of the study occurred during a major drought in california one might expect contaminants to build up on the landscape in the absence of rain and be released into stormwater at higher than average concentrations during subsequent average or wet years however this was not reflected in the monitoring results possibly due to the hydrophobicity of pahs combustion by products are a major source of urban organic contaminants summarized in edwards et al 2016 stein et al 2006 so we expected elevated concentrations at the city s corporation yard however unlike many bus fleets elk grove s buses are fueled with natural gas which is known to produce lower emissions than diesel fueled buses nylund et al 2004 this could account for the low number of detections of pahs and other urban organics associated with vehicle exhaust at the cy on the other hand pyrethroids and motor oil were consistently measured at the drywells among the pyrethroids bifenthrin was reported most frequently other pyrethroids such as cyfluthrin and cyhalothrin were detected less frequently consistent with previous reports weston et al 2005 stormwater collected at the sdb drywell showed more frequent detections of pyrethroids than samples from the cy given that bifenthrin is one of the most widely used pyrethroids for the control of ants and other insects in residential and commercial settings weston et al 2005 these findings are not surprising other studies in the region have shown median concentrations of bifenthrin similar to what we observed at sdb weston and lydy 2012 ssqp 2017 motor oil and to a lesser degree a handful of volatile organics such as acetone and tert butyl alcohol were also detected at elevated concentrations at the cy in influent stormwater but this group of organics were seen only at very low levels at sdb none were detected in groundwater at either site metals have been commonly reported in urban stormwater runoff tiefenthaler et al 2008 sacramento stormwater quality partnership 2013 while numerous metals were detected at both study sites most were below their reporting limits one exception was aluminum which was detected at up to a three fold greater concentration than the 1 ppm regulatory standard at the cy given the fact that aluminum is present in the highest concentration of any metal in the earth s crust and that aluminum is a common contaminant at locations where vehicles are housed federal register 1996 it is possible that the source of these elevated concentration was dirt that had been rinsed from the undercarriage and tires of buses 4 2 contaminants in groundwater in general there was a lack of a relationship between the contaminants in stormwater and those found in groundwater for example small concentrations of cyfluthrin a pyrethroid were detected in stormwater with the exception of a low level detection of cyfluthrin in groundwater at sdb prior to the installation of the dry well none was detected in groundwater numerous other organic contaminants including methylphenol dichlorobenzidine benzofluouranthene benzo a pyrene and multiple phthalates data not shown were detected in stormwater below the reporting limit and above the detection limit so were not quantifiable but none were detected in either vadose zone or water table wells similarly there was little to suggest that dry wells facilitated the movement of anthropogenic metals into groundwater while aluminum exceeded the regulatory standard on two occassions and exceeded the public health goal of 600 μg l on multiple occasions in both an upgradient and downgradient monitoring well the fact that none was detected in the vadose zone well and that elevated concentrations were seen in both upgradient and downgradient wells suggests the source of aluminum in groundwater was unlikely to be linked to effluent from the dry wells furthermore modeling results suggest that at the cy even in scenarios with higher domain hydraulic ocnductivity values the travel time for this contaminant to reach the public health goals health based advisory standards at the water table would be over 330 years at sdb the median concentration of iron in the vadose zone or upgradient wells was at or below the reporting limit but iron was detected on two occasions in both downgradient wells modeling results suggest travel time to the water table would be five years so it is unlikely these detections were related to dry well effluent external sources legacy metals in the surrounding soils or desorption of naturally occuring iron could account for these findings the fact that elevated concentrations of iron are commonly reported in drinking water in the region supports this interpretation elk grove water service 2016 similarly elevated concentrations of aluminum 110 640 μg l have been reported multiple times in monitoring and water supply well samples in the area california state water resources control board 2018 other metals including boron manganese antimony lead copper and zinc were also detected at low levels in stormwater but not in groundwater 4 3 role of vadose zone attenuation vadose zone modeling suggests a reason few of the 200 plus contaminants analyzed were detected in groundwater samples there is an abundant amount of clay in the unsaturated zones surrounding the dry wells 28 at the cy and 52 at sdb which appeared to have limited the movement of organic and metal contaminants both dry wells were completed above or in a clay unit forcing runoff to leave the dry well through holes in the sides and releasing the water into clay compared to sand or silt clay has a high adsorptive capacity due its large surface areas 10 m2 g and reactive surface functional groups essington 2015 clay appeared to attenuate the movement of pollutants via sorption as reflected by the consistent difference between contaminant concentrations in water entering the dry well and concentrations collected from vadose zone and water table monitoring wells when lindemann 1999 sampled the subsurface material below the dry well he found consistently elevated concentrations of pahs in some cases many times greater concentrations than in the influent stormwater suggesting sequestration of pollutants in the vadose zone taken together these findings point to the important role the vadose zone plays in pollutant attenuation this importance is reflected in the policy of some states in the united states where the composition of the vadose zone is used as one of two key factors the other being stormwater contaminant concentration used to determine the type of pretreatment required at a dry well installation washington state department of ecology 2006 the key role the vadose zone plays in attenuation can be most easily seen when comparing the worst case with the average case scenario in los angeles table 7 the vadose zone profile of the average case los angeles conditions was very simiar to the two sites in elk grove all three containing less than 50 sand the distance to the water table at sdb is about the same as the worst case scenario profile in los angeles both less than 3 m the key difference between the two is the sand content 46 at sdb and 80 for worst case conditions in los angeles the effect of the high amount of sand in la resulted in a decrease in the travel time the difference in the peak concentration at the water table after 500 years was much less prominent with the biggest differences seen for the contaminants with the highest koc values such as b a p and bifenthrin the greater percentage of sediment with higher foc value increased the contaminant sorption occuring within the model domain thereby decreasing the amount of the contaminant that reached the water table the model results for contaminants with high kd or koc values can be compared to the results obtained for contaminants that do not readily sorb in the subsurface tba has a koc value orders of magnitude lower than the other modeled contaminants and when multiplied by the foc values of the model domain sediment its kd was close to zero making its travel times comparable to that of the modeled conservative tracer the results showing greater contamination in higher permeability cases is not surprising and is consistent with reports of others bandeen 1987 used unsat 2 to estimate the migration of stormwater through an unsaturated zone composed primarily of highly permeable material e g gravel case 1 one composed of gravel underlain by sandy loam case 2 and a third that was a mix of sand and gravel underlain by sandy clay loam case 3 the migration time through the 100 ft deep vadose zone was over 90 fold faster in case 1 compared to case 3 the authors concluded that a multi layered subsurface profile with a significant amounts of clay would provide the maximum attenuation barraud et al 1999 found that coarse material in the subsurface was ineffective at attenuating metals in stormwater similarly wogsland 1988 in a field study of two dry wells concluded that clay and amorphous oxides were very effective at attenuating metals oil and grease additional research efforts summarized by edwards et al 2016 have drawn similar conclusions knowledge of the vadose zone lithology is a key factor in estimating risk to groundwater quality further vadose zone profiles that contain clay are effective at attenuating contaminant migration and reducing the risk of groundwater contamination the important role of clay layers shown by the model assumes that these layers are laterally extensive and not just small lenses or inclined toward the water table allowing infiltrating water to find alternative preferential pathways through connected sands and gravels in these heterogeneous alluvial sediments it has been shown that preferential layer dipping can generate lateral gradients that allow water to recharge the water table faster than in the case of large lateral essentially flat stratigraphic layers especially clay layers kung 1990 mccord et al 1991 laterally less extensive flat lying low permeability inclusions lead to lateral spreading e g russo et al 1994 harter and yeh 1996 for a dry well with an annual discharge rate qdry well the minimum extent r from a well of an essentially flat lying local clay inclusion large enough to absorb the full dry well discharge can be computed by postulating that 1 q dry well q clay where qclay is the vertical discharge rate through the clay lens under saturated unit gradient gravity discharge conditions qclay can be computed from darcy s law 2 q clay a k clay 1 π r 2 k clay where k clay is the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of clay a is a minimum circular clay lens area with radius r from the well it then follows that 3 r sqrt q dry well π k clay for qdry well 1000 m3 a 1 and kclay 10 1 m a 1 the minimum distance from the well to which a sufficiently protective clay lens must extend is on the order of 102 m or more as stated previously estimated mean lengths of the hydrofacies in the study area are 100 to 400 m meirovitz et al 2017 maples et al 2019 the laterally extensive layering conditions assumed in the one dimensional unsaturated zone flow and transport model are therefore not unrealistic in the examples simulated it is worth noting that even for the worst case scenario conditions in los angeles where bifenthrin concentration at the water table was estimated to reach 100 ng l after 500 years data not shown this contaminant s concentration is unlikely to pose a risk to human health risk to health was assessed by calculating the health protective concentration hpc of bifenthrin using the methodology employed to develop public health goals phg in california was estimated to be 314 μg l phgs are drinking water standards that are based solely on risk to human health oehha 2021 health protective concentrations were calculated since regulatory standards or phgs have not been established in the us in australia where drinking water guidelines for bifenthrin currently exists the standard is 0 2 mg l nhrmc and nrmmc 2011 both of these criteria values are orders of magnitude greater than the modeled concentration thus the health risk posed by bifenthrin is quite small taken together few contaminants were found in samples collected at the water table often detections were observed but they were mostly below the reporting limits for the majority of the contaminants that were analyzed by modeling their concentration would never reach a level approaching a health advisory standard such as the california public health goal or a us notification level nl under the most likely case scenarios these include metals and dehp under worst case scenario conditions however iron would reach the secondary regulatory standard for taste after as few as 5 years at cy or 190 days at sdb tert butyl alcohol would reach the nl within days other contaminants such as fipronil and imidacloprid would not reach their respective health protective concentrations it is difficult to validate modeling results for the two dry well sites given the short duration of water quality monitoring and the fact that any contaminants derived from dry well infiltration that arrive at the water table mixed with the groundwater diluting the concentrations of whatever pollutants were present as noted earlier the majority of the contaminants that were modeled were not predicted to reach the water table within the time period of the field study of the four contaminants that were predicted to reach detectable levels at the water table within the two year period under worst case scenario conditions two fipronil and imidacloprid were not measured in groundwater or stormwater samples the third tba was predicted to reach detectable levels at both sites within 12 days in the case of iron after 190 days at the sdb site tba wasn t detected in groundwater during the monitoring period this may be because mixing of dry well effluent with groundwater diluted the influent tba concentration to below reporting limits the fourth contaminant was iron it was frequently detected in stormwater and groundwater and was detected at significant concentrations downgradient of the sdb dry well iron was detected at low concentration but in a groundwater sample taken from a downgradient well in february 2015 it was also detected above its secondary mcl in upgradient and downgradient groundwater in september 2015 higher concentration downgradient after which it was not detected in sdb groundwater again the detection of iron is consistent with the results of the vadose zone modeling 4 4 role of pretreatment on average concentrations of a representative group of five organic and metal contaminants were reduced by 50 as a result of passage through the water quality basin at sdb and by 67 as they passed through the grassy swale at the cy although the water quality basin was much larger than the swale vegetation was more irregular and preferential flow pathways permitted water to reach the dry well with less than optimal pretreatment in contrast the grassy swale consisted of smooth long grass within a deep swale that retained water for 5 15 min prior to entering the sedimentation well this pretreatment was effective for most contaminants for example the median concentration of aluminum declined about three fold as it passed throμgh the grassy swale many other contaminants followed this pattern including bifenthrin motor oil acetone and aluminum not all data shown our findings are consistent with reports in the literature adolfson 1995 compared the pretreatment features of three different dry well systems with no pretreatment with a structural pretreatment only a sedimentation well and with both a grassy swale and a sedimentation well it was found that the greatest pollutant removal occurred with the third design where the removal efficiency was greater than 80 in some cases reports in the international stormwater bmp database 2016 suggest that a grassy swale typically removes about 30 of total suspended solids on which contaminants are frequently adsorbed the swale at the cy removed about double that amount approximately 63 of suspended solids these results highlight the importance of including a pretreatment feature in a dry well system unfortunately the other portion of the pretreatment train the 1 5 m deep sedimentation wells were insufficiently deep to optimize deposition of sediment particles little sediment was ever observed at the bottom of either sed well further commercial and municipal sedimentation wells are typically 3 to 4 5 m deep in order to provide sufficient depth for the settling of suspended material torrent resources phoenix az usa bureua of environmental services city of portland or usa 2006 given that most of the contaminants of concern in this study are particle bound this can be an efficient way to remove not only particles which can clog a dry well over time but also contaminants clark and pitt 2007 wilson et al 1989 olson 1987 adolfson 1995 and other studies reviewed by edwards et al 2016 found efficient removal of suspended sediment and pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons oil and grease multiple phthalates and most metals in these chambers there does not appear to be any literature that examines the attenuation potential of grassy swales on water soluble pesticides but it is doubtful if structural pretreament would be efficient for water solubles nonetheless for the majority of contaminants structural pretreatment has been found reduce pollutant load 4 5 contaminants of special concern nitrate is one example of a pollutant that is notoriously difficult to manage it was one of the few other contaminants that were detected at elevated concentrations in groundwater nitrate concentration in stormwater was consistently below the concentration found in groundwater at both study sites at sdb where groundwater concentrations of nitrate exceeded the mcl there were no significant differences between the upgradient and downgradient nitrate concentrations suggesting that infiltration through the dry wells was not a major source although it could have been a contributor given the historical use of this area for agriculture it is likely that nitrate accumulated in the unsaturated zone and has been leaching to groundwater for decades e g harter et al 2017 nitrate is difficult to manage with vegetated features constructed wetlands are a frequently used option for removal of nitrogen in urban stormwater and agricultural runoff vyazal 2007 however processes in the dry well s pretreatment basin which remain wet only during rain events are likely different from wetland conditions due to its water solubility intl bmp database 2016 neither bioretention cells nor grassy swales have been shown to be effective at attenuating nitrate in fact the concentration of nitrate is often greater leaving a bioretention cell than when it entered primarily due to nitrification li and davis 2014 in the sacramento region nitrate nitrite in stormwater has been consistently less than 1 mg l over the past 15 years considerably below the regulatory standard of 10 mg l for nitrate n ssqp 2017 similar concentrations have been reported in other parts of the u s li and davis 2014 however it appears that nitrogen concentrations in runoff are location specific for example a southern california study reported a median nitrate n concentration from lawns of 5 42 mg l toor et al 2017 due to the water solubility of nitrate the varying concentrations possible in stormwater its existing ubiquitousness in groundwater in many locations and its well documented toxicity to infants fewtrell 2004 special consideration is warranted in the selection of pretreatment and dry well siting to minimize its migration lastly our modeling results suggest that two water soluble pesticides neonicotinoids and fipronil moved relatively rapidly through the unsaturated zone these pesticides have been detected in urban runoff with increasing frequency teerlink 2017 california department of pesticide regulation 2016 masoner et al 2019 the modeling suggested they could move through the vadose zone in as little as 24 h los angeles scenario parameters included 2 m vertical separation in sandy soil up to as much as six to seven years at the elk grove sites research examining the mobility of these pesticides in soil has shown that the neonicotinoids are more mobile than fipronil primarily due to their high water solubility 610 mg l for imidacloprid vs 3 8 mg l for fipronil bonmatin et al 2015 their mobility is altered by the composition of soil organic carbon and clays act to attenuate these pesticides to varying degrees with little retention evident in sandy soils fossen 2006 teerlink 2017 because of their solubility the california department of pesticide regulation has placed imidacloprid on the groundwater protection list to date field studies have not been performed examining attenuation of these pesticides by various forms of pretreatment this is a area of research that needs further attention while the mobility of both neonicotinoids and fipronil pesticides raises concern their concentrations in stormwater are relatively low reducing the potential risk to drinking water quality masoner et al 2019 found the median concentration of imidacloprid in samples collected from 50 storm events was approximately 25 ng l the fipronil concentration was approximately 20 ng l these concentrations were a magnitude lower than the ones used for modeling in this study 0 9 and 0 5 μg l respectively the modeled concentrations reflected the higher end of values collected from sampling of stormwater in california conducted by the department of pesticide regulation in 2016 estimates of the concentration of these two pesticides at the water table after 500 years were compared to the health protective concentrations the hpc of imidacloprid is 358 μg l a value about 400 fold greater than the estimated concentration of 0 9 μg l at the water table this difference has a greater margin of safety compared to fipronil where the concentration for the average case scenario after 500 years at both sites was slightly more than half of the hpc of 1 19 μg l this calculation assumed that the concentration of the pesticide entering the dry well was the same as what would be found in drinking water assuming no dilution in the aquifer both are conservative assumptions considering the mobility and concentration in stormwater of these two pesticides it does not appear that either would pose a significant risk to the quality of drinking water or human health this could change in the future if the use of these classes of pesticides were to increase there clearly is a need to develop pretreatment facilities that could capture water soluble pesticides and nitrate methods to attenuate nitrate using nitrogen fixing plants such as alfalfa in vegetated features has been investigated kim et al 2003 these investigators found greater than 90 efficiency of removal of nitrate with alflalfa use in bioretention others are exploring the use of anion cation pillows that could be added to dry well systems to attenuate water soluble pesticides j mayer 2014 pers comm while the risk to human health will vary with specific conditions the need to better understand the behavior of these types of contaminants and identify ways to efficiently manage them would be worthwhile 4 6 risk of mobilizing naturally occurring toxic metals constituents in stormwater such as ions and certain metals have the potential to mobilize naturally occurring arsenic and chromium these two metals were regularly detected in groundwater but not in stormwater for example at both sites arsenic concentrations in stormwater were too low to quantify however it was detected in all groundwater wells at concentrations of 2 to 4 μg l in many locations in california and the southwestern usa in general arsenic is endemic in drinking water in the study region the median arsenic concentration in groundwater based on samples collected over the last 20 years was about 5 μg l half of the regulatory standard of 10 μg l however one public supply well less than a half mile from the cy site had a concentration of arsenic as high as 64 μg l in 2008 california state water resources control board 2018 arsenic is a minor component of granite a major geologic feature of the sierra nevada mountain range in eastern california and it is also present in metamorphic rocks often bound to iron complexes on the western slopes of the sierras under oxidizing conditions in the presence of iron arsenic is primarily retained in the solid phase a shift to reducing conditions however could cause arsenic to be released through a variety of mechanisms bose and sharma 2002 both ions such as sulfate or bicarbonate and metals contained in stormwater could alter the redox state thus mobilizing arsenic a weak positive correlation between iron and arsenic suggested that iron in stormwater effluent could cause a reduction of arsenic bearing iron oxides resulting in the mobilization of arsenic bose and sharma 2002 pierce and moore 1982 modeling results of the worst case scenario suggested that iron would reach the water table at the cy in about five years therefore in this two year study it was unlikely that stormwater effluent influenced the redox conditions the case was different at the sdb where iron was estimated to reach the water table within a few months yet no correlation was found between iron and arsenic at this site data not shown this could be due to the small sample size or the lack of a meaningful relationship while this short study produced no evidence of stormwater constituents mobilizing toxic metals other research suggests that this could occur jurgens et al 2008 found weak positive correlations between iron and dissolved arsenic in a study of the aquifer in modesto ca usa they also observed a positive correlation between select infiltrated metals and uranium concentration in groundwater further research would help clarify these relationships 5 conclusion this study presents the most comprehensive data and analysis to date on water quality phenomena associated with dry wells for over 200 potential contaminants at actual field sites the data include water quality sampling of not only the storm influent and dry well waters but also the surrounding vadose zone and underlying groundwater allowing a total system evaluation of possible water quality threats from these structures that are increasingly being considered for enhancement of groundwater recharge to address critical groundwater overdraft problems results suggest that using dry wells to infiltrate stormwater would pose minimal risk to groundwater quality when proper pretreatment is employed and source water does not contain potentially mobile groundwater contaminants most contaminants commonly found in urban runoff would either be attenuated in a pretreatment system or in the vadose zone for varying degrees of time ranging from decades to centuries the exceptions would be for highly water soluble non degradable and or possibly mobile contaminants such as nitrate usually found in low concentration in most urban runoff and water soluble pesticides such as the neonicotinoids this also includes the group of less mobile per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas which are an emerging contaminant of concern due to their long term persistence xiao et al 2015 research is needed to find new methods of pretreatment that assist in minimizing the risk of mobile or persistent water soluble pollutants leaching from dry wells additional research to quantify the capacity of the unsaturated zone to adsorb contaminants would also help clarify potential long term risks our field and modeling work suggests that given appropriate consideration for construction including pre treatment and siting dry wells can serve as a valuable tool to advance the effective use of water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

1333,dry wells gravity fed infiltration wells have frequently been used to recharge aquifers with stormwater especially in urban areas as well as manage flood risk and reduce surface water body contamination from stormwater pollutants however only limited assessment of their potential adverse impacts on groundwater quality exists dry well recharge can bypass significant portions of the filtering capacity of the vadose zone stormwater and groundwater monitoring data and analysis of transport of a wide range of historic and current use stormwater chemicals of concern is lacking to address these gaps two dry wells were constructed with vegetated and structural pretreatment features to assess the likelihood of stormwater contaminants reaching the aquifer we monitored assessed and compared the presence of contaminants in stormwater to water quality in the vadose zone and shallow groundwater after it passed through the dry well the dry wells were installed at a suburban residential and at a suburban commercial site the selected sites were overlying a regional unconsolidated and highly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer system stormwater vadose zone and groundwater samples were collected during five storms and analyzed for over 200 contaminants of concern relatively few contaminants were detected in stormwater generally at low concentrations prior to stormwater entering the dry well 50 65 of contaminants were removed by vegetated pretreatment in groundwater metals such as aluminum and iron were detected at similar concentrations in both upgradient and downgradient wells suggesting the source of these metals was not dry well effluent naturally occurring metals such as chromium and arsenic were not detected in stormwater but were found at elevated concentrations in groundwater a modeling assessment suggests that the travel time of metals and hydrophobic organic contaminants to the water table at these sites ranges from years to centuries whereas water soluble pesticides would likely reach the water table within days to months the modeling assessment also showed that more vulnerable sites with higher fraction of alluvial sands would have much shorter contaminant travel times however none of the contaminants assessed reached concentrations that pose a risk to human health across the scenarios considered no evidence was found either through direct measurements or vadose zone modeling that contaminants present in suburban stormwater degraded or would degrade groundwater quality at the studied sites and site conditions future work is needed to address emerging contaminants of concern keywords stormwater infiltration dry wells groundwater quality vadose zone modeling aquifer recharge urban stormwater quality 1 introduction the necessity of water resources stewardship has been brought into sharper focus by the impacts of climate change over the past decade in many parts of the world more extreme weather events such as flooding and drought have motivated water managers as well as local and state government agencies to re examine water management policies and practices chauhan et al 2021 dillon et al 2019 in the united states of america for example the impacts of drought and climate change on the availability of water resources have led to the adoption of the sustainable groundwater management act in california legislation enacted to minimize overdraft and work toward sustainable groundwater use http groundwater ucdavis edu sgma urban stormwater is one source of water for recharge but there are a number of challenges to optimizing its use in some areas a low permeable subsurface e g clay may prevent or limit recharge dry wells large diameter vertical perforated pipes can penetrate these barriers and release water into more permeable units within the vadose zone closer to the aquifer however concerns about groundwater contamination have prevented dry wells from being widely used in some areas nasem 2015 metals pesticides and organics may be entrained in runoff as it flows over the land surface masoner et al 2019 stein et al 2006 tiefenthaler et al 2008 infiltration of this runoff through dry wells releases the pollutants closer to the aquifer diminishing the attenuation role of the unsaturated zone apart from managing recharge dry wells are also used to reduce runoff to and pollution of urban creeks clark and pitt 2007 nrc 2009 a variety of low impact development practices including bioretention cells swales and infiltration basins have been adopted to prevent contaminated stormwater from adversely affecting waterways and aquatic life askarizadeh et al 2015 however due to the presence of low permeability surface soils and near surface sediments in many arid locations these practices can be ineffective at infiltrating stormwater dry wells are an alternative method to enhance infiltration by allowing water to bypass low permeability layers and facilitating the movement of stormwater into more permeable units of the subsurface given the general lack of data and analysis of potential contamination from dry wells regulators and water managers are sometimes hesitant to support their use there are relatively few scientific studies that have evaluated the risk of groundwater contamination associated with dry well use most of them having been performed over 20 years ago edwards et al 2016 the few longer term 5 years studies that have been performed have indicated that dry wells did not result in appreciable aquifer contamination dallman and spongberg 2012 jurgens et al 2008 in some cases existing groundwater contamination was diluted by the infiltrating stormwater lasgrwc 2010 pretreatment chambers that capture sediment and associated metals and organics have been reported to be effective at significantly reducing the concentration of contaminants prior to runoff entering the dry well wilson et al 1989 clark and pitt 2007 additionally the composition of the vadose zone can have a significant impact on attenuation of metals and organics some contaminants will sorb strongly in clay layers while unconsolidated sand and gravel layers have limited attenuation capacity bandeen 1987 wogsland 1988 wilson et al 1989 much of our current knowledge is based on site specific reports that address specific regulatory requirements while rigorous comprehensive scientific experiments are lacking studies have analyzed stormwater or groundwater quality but not both some did not include upgradient and downgradient groundwater monitoring wells lindemann 1999 adolfson associates 1995 olson 1987 barraud et al 1999 wogsland 1988 while some long term stormwater and groundwater analysis exist for a broad range of contaminants wilson et al 1989 dallman and spongberg 2012 most are limited in the scope of contaminants investigated or in the duration of the period of analysis several recent studies have employed vadose zone modeling to quantify dry well performance in terms of stormwater infiltration rates and volumes but these studies did not model stormwater contaminant transport liang et al 2018 sasidharan et al 2018 sasidharan et al 2019 qi et al 2020 only one previous study used modeling to assess risks associated with dry well use but it did not include any field monitoring bandeen 1987 the goal of this study was to perform an integrated monitoring and assessment study that simultaneously considers performance of stormwater pretreatment on water quality and potential impacts on the vadose zone and shallow groundwater with respect to over 200 contaminants of interest within two representative urban settings we installed dry wells with pretreatment and an associated monitoring networks at an urban residential site and at an urban commercial site monitoring included observation of stormwater prior to pretreatment prior to entering the dry well in the vadose zone adjacent to the dry well and both upgradient and downgradient of the dry well in groundwater observations occurred over a two year period we analyzed for several contaminant groups including metals volatile and semi volatile organics and also for current use pesticides pyrethroids a vadose flow and transport assessment using hydrus was performed to assess potential long term impacts of the monitoring data collected and their implication for other sites overlying unconsolidated alluvial sediments to our knowledge this is the first study that includes pyrethroids a widely used class of pesticides commonly detected in urban stormwater sampling in california amweg et al 2006 and the first study to consider fipronil and imidacloprid stormwater contaminants of emerging concern this is also the first comprehensive modeling assessment to expand on necessarily intermediate term site specific experimental results across the pretreatment dry well vadose zone groundwater continuum 2 material and methods 2 1 dry well system and setting two dry wells and associated monitoring well networks were constructed at two locations in elk grove california in the united states elk grove is in the sacramento valley which is the northernmost watershed in california s central valley and has a mediterranean climate with distinct annual wet and dry seasons precipitation normally occurs between the months of october and may with an average annual rainfall of 47 04 cm noaa 2010 the drought that began in california during 2012 persisted through 2014 2015 and 2016 the years during which the drywell field study occurred elk grove received approximately 17 8 cm of precipitation during the 2014 water year 39 4 cm during the 2015 water year and 37 6 cm during the 2016 water year weather underground 2016 elk grove lies between the cosumnes and sacramento rivers and the geology of the area is characterized by fluvial sediment deposition that creates unconsolidated interbedded layers consisting of lenses of gravel sand silt clay and various mixtures of the three meirovitz et al 2017 the groundwater system underlying the elk grove area is consequently semi confined with the aquifers occurring in sand and gravel layers and the finer grained layers serving as confining beds or aquitards county wide shallow aquifer water table depths have historically ranged from 6 1 m to 21 3 m below land surface department of water resources 1997 each dry well was 1 m m wide and 14 m deep one dry well was constructed at the strawberry detention basin sdb located within a 70 0 ha ha residential neighborhood stormwater at this site was collected from a single family residential community which included a local high school with large areas of turf the site of the second dry well was the city s corporation yard cy a 0 26 ha drainage shed that serves as a bus fleet servicing maintenance and parking facility runoff that drained to this dry well system was collected from the rooftop of an office maintenance building and the hardscape of the expansive bus parking lot each dry well consisted of a drilled borehole 1 1 m in diameter containing a 0 76 m diameter cylindrical polypropylene casing approximately 13 7 m deep with 2 5 cm cm perforations along its length a 10 cm diameter pvc stilling pipe capped at the top and open at the dry well bottom perforated with 1 3 cm diameter holes spaced at 13 cm intervals on two sides of the pipe was placed within the casing the void space between the polypropylene casing and the stilling pipe was filled with 6 mm mm diameter pea gravel as was the annular space between the borehole wall and the casing both dry wells were completed at least 2 5 m above the seasonal high water table fig 1 the monitoring wells located upgradient and downgradient of the dry wells were completed at the water table monitoring wells were 6 cm in diameter and were completed at 76 m bgs at the cy and 58 m bgs at sdb at sdb the upgradient well was mw3 while at the cy it was mw1 fig 2 shows the locations of the monitoring wells in comparison to the dry wells at each site these wells were fitted with pressure transducers to determine the depth to the water table and estimate the local groundwater gradients a vadose zone well mw2 was also constructed 4 6 and 7 6 m downgradient of each dry well during the rainy season the screen on mw2 at sdb was actually below the water table so it functioned as a fourth water table well the dry well system was composed of three parts a vegetated pretreatment feature designed to remove suspended solids and associated pollutants a structural pretreatment feature a sedimentation chamber that provided additional treatment and the dry well itself fig 1 at sdb the vegetated feature was an existing water quality basin containing small trees shrubs and grass while at the cy a deep grassy swale was constructed to detain water for up to 10 min prior to entering the sedimentation well the sedimentation chambers were approximately 1 5 m deep and 0 76 m in diameter the pipes connecting the sedimentation chambers to the dry wells were placed approximately 0 5 m from the bottom of the chambers due to insufficient depth and pipe inlet height stormwater did not have sufficient residence time in the sedimentation chambers to permit most sediment and associated pollutants to settle therefore pretreatment was performed primarily by the vegetated features each dry well was approximately 13 5 m deep and was completed 4 5 sdb and 9 cy meter above the water table at both sites clay layers composed significant portions of the lithology 27 at the cy and 45 at sdb at the cy there was a meter of clayey material between the bottom of the dry well and the water table 2 2 stormwater monitoring stormwater samples were collected five times over a two year period when storm precipitation totals were 6 4 mm or greater and when there was less than 2 54 mm of rain during the preceding 72 h the water year at our locations begins in october with the onset of winter rains most precipitation stops in march but can extend into april or may the study was conducted during two water years with below average rainfall 26 7 cm in the first year and 34 3 cm in the second normal rainfall for the region is 46 cm during each rain event runoff was collected at two locations at each site as indicated by the red arrows in fig 1 the stormwater samples were collected in pre cleaned bottles every 15 60 min depending on the intensity and duration of the rain event and placed on ice total volume of stormwater runoff was measured at each site then an algorithm was used to select samples for preparing the flow weighted composites appropriate volumes from each collection bottle were added to a large carboy reflecting 80 of the runoff volume mixed then aliquoted into appropriate vials for analytical chemistry total storm runoff volumes and representative flow rates were calculated using the areas of orifices or holes in a stand pipe that controlled the volume of water entering the sedimentation chamber each orifice could be plugged so that stormwater could enter the sedimentation chamber only through the open hole different sized orifices were associated with different flow rate based on lab calibration testing in addition to these samples during two rain events composite samples were collected at the stormwater outfall or curb cut green arrow fig 1 additional grab samples were collected at curb cut storm drain outfall during all other rain events during the second wet season of the study monitoring occurred during the first storm event of the water year in order to capture the first flush of contaminants water samples were analyzed for over 200 contaminants at a local epa and elap certified environmental laboratory accreditation program laboratory employing standard methods for sample bottle preparation chain of custody and reporting of both detection and reporting limits for all analytes contaminants for analysis were chosen based on the frequency of their detection in local stormwater samples as well as recommendations from local and state stormwater managers as well as reports of emerging contaminants they included total suspended solids us epa 160 2 pyrethroid pesticides california dept fish wildlife water pollution control laboratory method 53 chlorophenoxy herbicides us epa 8151a total petroleum hydrocarbons and motor oil us epa 8015 diesel and gas pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons us epa 8310 semi volatile organics us epa 625 volatile organics

duplicates and field duplicates were also collected to control for field contamination and reproducibility of collection methods laboratory quality assurance included analysis of matrix spike and matrix spike duplicates as well as laboratory control samples data was reported for the detection and reporting limits but only results above the reporting limits were used for statistical analysis 2 3 groundwater and vadose zone monitoring groundwater samples were collected from groundwater and vadose zone monitoring wells prior to the construction of the dry wells to characterize ambient groundwater quality one to two days after the five storm sampling events from the vadose zone well and two to seven days after the rain event from the groundwater wells additionally groundwater samples were collected after the completion of each wet season the timing of wet season collections was informed by water level data from pressure transducers installed in some of the wells samples were analyzed for the same set of contaminants measured in stormwater all groundwater samples that were used for analysis of metals were filtered in the field thus the analysis reflects dissolved concentrations this was not the case for other stormwater samples which were not filtered outside of this difference all other samples were collected in the same manner 2 4 statistical methods non parametric statistics were used to analyze contaminant data because the data were not normally distributed helsel 2005 contaminant concentrations at the sites of sample collections were compared to assess the relationships between concentrations in stormwater collected as it entered the dry well system after pretreatment in the vadose zone and in the upgradient and downgradient water table well samples censored data was recoded by subtracting non detects from a constant higher than the maximum concentration for each contaminant prior to statistical analysis helsel 2005 the kruskal wallis test was used for those contaminants with a single analytical reporting limit a statistically derived number that was between two and ten fold greater than the minimum detection limit if significance was identified p 0 05 the concentrations of contaminants at each study site were ranked then tukey s test of honestly significant differences was used to identify differences between groups by analyzing differences in ranks not the actual values tukey s test substituted for bonferroni s correction for type i errors limits the false discovery rate helsel 2005 for those contaminants with two or greater reporting limits generalized wilcoxon tests were performed gehan test a variation of the generalized wilcoxon test used to determine whether two group percentiles are the same or if one is higher than the other was used to identify differences between groups helsel 2005 correlation analysis was performed on data used to investigate redox couples and ion exchange reactions in the subsurface all statistical analyses were performed using statistica tibco software inc palo alto ca usa 2 5 vadose zone contaminant transport modeling given the relatively short two year period of this study the long term risks to groundwater quality associated with dry well use could not be assessed from groundwater monitoring alone numerical modeling analysis was used to estimate potential long term effects we sought to determine the breakthrough time of 1 of the contaminant s input concentration the time at which the contaminant would reach any existing regulatory levels and the peak concentration at the water table after 500 years of infiltration for each contaminant at each dry well site for a range of subsurface conditions chemical transport parameters and contaminant input concentrations the one dimensional vadose zone water flow and solute transport modeling software hydrus 1d was used to model the vertical transport of select contaminants in infiltrating stormwater through the subsurface domain representing the length between the bottom of the dry well and the site s seasonal high water table known as the separation distance at each site šimůnek et al 2013 1d rather than 2d or 3d modeling was deemed appropriate because of the laterally extensive layered structures of the vadose zone sediments at these sites which are also typical of the california central valley and many other sedimentary basins specifically the lateral extent of the sediment layers representing coarse and fine grained hydrofacies e g sands gravels silts clays in the study area have been estimated to be about 100 m to 400 m meirovitz et al 2017 maples et al 2019 making more complex 2d or 3d flow patterns due to laterally discontinuous layering unlikely at these vadose zone sites this strong horizontal stratification is also reflected in the stratigraphic cross sections shown in fig 3 in other words although the subsurface in the region is highly heterogeneous in 3d at the kilometers scale at the scale of these vadose zone sites and due to the strong tendency for vertical flow to dominate in the vadose zone we concluded a 1d modeling would be both appropriate and most likely to represent a direct pathway to the water table i e a worst case scenario hydrus 1d was used to obtain travel times and contaminant concentrations at the water table to gain insight into the case where the silt and clay layers that impede flow are missing two hypothetical coarse grained sites in los angeles were also modeled stormwater contaminants detected during field testing were selected for the modeling based on their frequency of detection and toxicity input contaminant concentrations were calculated from the results of the stormwater quality sampling analyses further fipronil and imidacloprid two pesticides that were not analyzed for in site stormwater but whose presence has been detected in urban stormwater with increased frequency were also included in the model their input concentrations were based on data obtained from the california department of pesticide regulation the amount of water coming into the domain was determined from the results of groundwater stage analyses water and solutes were input at the top of the model domain and allowed to drain freely from the bottom which represented the elevation of the seasonal high water table the hydrus 1d domains were created using lithologic cross sections created for each study site fig 3 these cross sections were created using lithologic logs obtained during the drilling of monitoring wells the sediment layers between the dry well bottom and the seasonal high water table were estimated from the cross sections and the textural classifications and layer thicknesses were duplicated in the hydrus 1d domain sediment profiles the cy domain was 9 75 m in length and composed of seven layers of sediment from top to bottom 70 cm of clay 165 cm of silty sand 60 cm of sandy silty clay 60 cm of silty clay 285 cm of sand 85 cm of silty clay and 250 cm of sandy silt the sdb domain was 2 78 m in length and composed of two layers from top to bottom 150 cm of sandy silty clay and 128 cm of sand the time variable boundary conditions were determined based on the results of the stormwater sampling the results of the dissolved concentration calculations and the stage records for each dry well site the water flow boundary condition bc at the top of both model domains is variable pressure head and flux and the solute transport bc at the top of both model domains is concentration flux the bottom water flow bcs are free drainage i e zero gradient boundary conditions here we chose the free drainage boundary condition to represent worst case most downward flux flow and transport conditions typical of conditions when the water table is lower than the seasonal high position chosen to represent the bottom of the domain the bottom solute transport bc for both domains is zero concentration gradient which in effect accomplishes a specified solute flux that is a function of the water velocity and the computed concentration at the boundary but does not account for the effect of dispersion across the boundary the latter can be shown to contribute negligibly to the overall solute flux under the simulated conditions the top water flow and solute transport bcs are time variable a 365 day record of daily pressure head or flux and contaminant concentration in the influent water was created for each drywell site the cy model time variable bc is a constant pressure head of 400 cm for 230 days and 0 flux for the remaining 135 days repeated each year the sdb model domain s upper water flow boundary condition is a constant pressure head of 300 cm for 215 days and 0 flux for the remaining 150 days repeated each year the time variable bcs were determined based on the results of the stormwater sampling the results of the dissolved concentration calculations and the stage records for each drywell site the heads of 400 cm and 300 cm represent the average pressure head stage during the wet season for the 2016 water year contaminant concentration remains constant over time in influent water for both sites the annual boundary condition time series is repeated as needed for each model run to capture the full breakthrough curve of each contaminant under each scenario model run time periods range from one year to many years depending on the transport parameters of the modeled contaminant the group of contaminants selected for modeling were those that were regularly reported in stormwater monitoring at either of the two study sites or were newer generation pesticides regularly detected in urban stormwater monitoring in by the california department of pesticide regulation 2016 input variables specified for the modeling included sediment hydraulic properties and contaminant chemical properties that affect transport the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the lowest hydraulic conductivity layer was estimated using field data and the rosetta dynamically linked library neural network accessed through hydrus 1d was used to estimate the ks of the other sediments based on their textural classification schaap et al 2001 literature sources were used to determine values for subsurface chemical parameters and for all contaminant transport parameters because of uncertainty in both the subsurface hydraulic and chemical conditions and the transport characteristics of the selected contaminants eight sensitivity scenarios were run for each of the chosen contaminants at each site the variables that were changed to create the eight scenarios selected due to site variability were contaminant input concentration ks and fraction organic carbon foc values for organic contaminants or soil water partitioning coefficient kd values for metals the ks values were calculated from actual site conditions foc and kd values were obtained from relevant literature allison and allison 2005 baes et al 1984 interstate technology and regulatory council 2015 office of air and radiation usepa 1999 sheppard and sohlenius 2009 strenge and peterson 1989 the worst case scenario conditions were modeled using total contaminant concentrations in stormwater high ks values and low foc or kd values maximizing the input concentration of contaminants and the movement of those contaminants through the vadose zone the most likely case was modeled using the mobile fraction of each contaminant the dissolved concentration which was calculated from total concentration using the relevant partition coefficient see table 1 and table 2 for selected values of soil hydraulic properties and contaminant transport parameters for the cy and sdb sites respectively the kd value for an organic contaminant is dependent on the fraction organic carbon foc of the sediment the contaminant is moving through to capture this variability in the model the foc values used for clay and silt sediments were varied between 0 01 or 0 001 and 0 001 or 0 0001 for sands interstate technology and regulatory council 2015 in addition to the two elk grove sites modeling was performed for two theoretical sites in los angeles california united states of america the sacramento region within which the city of elk grove is located as well as the greater california central valley are known for the presence of clay and silt layers interbedded with the aquifer sediments given the capacity of clay to bind many contaminants there was concern that elk grove modeling results could suggest a greater protection of groundwater than might be found in other parts of the state or country where sand can compose significant portions of the unsaturated zone further the diversity and concentration of contaminants could be larger than what might be seen in a suburban area such as elk grove modeled sites in the los angeles metropolitan area were used to fill this gap stormwater contaminants and concentrations for the los angeles area were determined from stormwater quality literature and sediment hydraulic and chemical properties were sourced from relevant literature allison and allison 2005 baes et al 1984 interstate technology and regulatory council 2015 office of air and radiation usepa 1999 sheppard and sohlenius 2009 stein et al 2006 strenge and peterson 1989 tiefenthaler et al 2008 see table 3 for selected values of soil hydraulic properties and contaminant transport parameters for the theoretical dry well sites in los angeles the foc values used for the la domain were 0 005 for clay 0 001 for sandy loam and loam and 0 0001 for sand parameter values were not modified between model runs as the two sediment profiles created for the los angeles numerical analysis already represent theoretical average and worst case subsurface scenarios 2 6 analysis of desorption of arsenic and chromium arsenic and chromium are naturally occurring toxic metals present in geologic formations in the sacramento region gama 2021 to investigate the possibility that constituents such as salts or metals in stormwater could cause desorption and solubilization of either of these toxic metals a preliminary analysis of the relationship between ion and redox couples in groundwater was performed concentrations of arsenic chromium and numerous ions were assessed as part of stormwater and groundwater quality analysis comparisons between upgradient and downgradient concentration of arsenic and chromium at the water table were made and correlation analysis of redox couples was performed 3 results 3 1 stormwater infiltration rates and volumes estimates of cumulative annual stormwater volumes infiltrated through each dry well were obtained using the results of orifice flow measurements taken during sampled storm events as well as dry well stage data gathered from pressure transducers the total volumes of stormwater infiltrated through the cy and sdb dry wells during the 2016 water year were estimated to be approximately 246 7 cubic meters m3 and 863 4 m3 respectively the sdb dry well received approximately 3 5 times greater volumes of influent stormwater per storm event than the cy dry well did this is because the sdb dry well receives stormwater from an area of approximately 70 ha compared to the cy dry well s paved 0 26 ha surface the infiltration rates at sdb were on average 12 7 cubic meters h m3 h considerably higher than the 7 2 m3 h measured at the cy factors accounting for this disparity include differences in the volumes of water entering the dry well causing differences in head as well as differences in vadose zone composition see fig 3 3 2 stormwater and groundwater quality contaminants that were detected in stormwater samples followed similar patterns based on their origin anthropogenic contaminants such as the pyrethroid bifenthrin aluminum and iron typically had elevated concentrations in stormwater which declined to varying degree as runoff passed through the vegetated pretreatment feature fig 4 panels a b and c none were detected above the reporting limit in groundwater among the organic compounds analyzed pyrethroid pesticides and motor oil were detected most frequently of the nine pyrethroids measured bifenthrin was detected at the highest concentrations primarily at the sdb fig 4a however bifenthrin was not detected in any of the groundwater samples the average concentration of bifenthrin declined by about 50 as stormwater passed through the pretreatment features while the median concentration in groundwater was below the reporting limit of the other pesticides measured a single chlorophenoxy herbicide dalaphon in groundwater only and glyphosate in stormwater only were each detected once in both cases the concentrations were below the relevant regulatory standard most volatile organics were not detected in stormwater some volatiles including toluene acetone and tert butyl alcohol tba were identified near the reporting limit and below the regulatory standard acetone was detected once at 300 μg l in stormwater entering the cy swale but the concentration fell by 50 after pretreatment acetone was not quantifiable in groundwater because its concentration was below the reporting limit at sdb acetone was occasionally noted in stormwater at low levels and once just above the reporting limit in a downgradient groundwater monitoring well data not shown not suprisingly motor oil was detected in stormwater at both sites but at a ten fold higher concentration at the cy than at the sdb median values 1 2 vs 0 11 mg l respectively pretreatment resulted in a three fold or greater reduction in concentration none was found in groundwater samples at either site metals measured as dissolved in water were frequently detected in stormwater and groundwater at both sites for example the concentration of aluminum in influent stormwater was 3 mg l at the cy three times the mcl but fell to 1 mg l after pretreatment fig 4b the second most commonly detected metal was iron fig 4c exceedances of the secondary regulatory standard for taste and odor were found at both sites for influent stormwater and stormwater measured after pretreatment although the concentrations were considerably reduced after pretreatment in contrast to these pollutants a completely different pattern of detections was observed for naturally occuring metals such as arsenic fig 4d and chromium data not shown concentrations in stormwater were not detectable while concentrations in groundwater were elevated in both upgradient and downgradient wells these differences were statistically significant in the case of arsenic over the two year study period concentrations of both metals were elevated in the summer dry season and declined during the rainy season likely due to dilution caused by the infiltration of stormwater no significant increase of arsenic or chromium concentrations were observed downgradient of the dry well compared to the upgradient well suggesting mobilization of metals during the two year study period did not occur when data from all groundwater samples at both sites was pooled no significant correlations were found between arsenic and sulfate bicarbonate or manganese the single exception to this pattern was a weak positive correlation between arsenic and iron p 0 056 mobilization due to competing effects could not be excluded and therefore further monitoring of common competing anions such as phosphate silicate or vanadate is needed no significant correlation was found between chromium and manganese data not shown despite the fact that manganese oxides are recognized as the major viable oxidants which oxidize insoluble trivalent chromium to soluble hexavalent chromium under a range of environmental conditions eary and rai 1987 guha et al 2001 nitrate is the single water soluble constituent that can be toxic at high concentrations 10 mg l no 3 n us epa regulatory standard nitrate concentrations were detectable in stormwater and groundwater exceeding the regulatory standard in groundwater at both sites fig 5 it was notable that at the cy samples from the upgradient water table monitoring well had a significantly higher concentration than samples from the two downgradient wells suggesting that stormwater might have actually diluted nitrate concentrations 3 3 estimate of the effectiveness of pretreatment the concentrations of a subset of contaminants for which there were detectable quantities and that have varied chemical properties were compared before and after pretreatment table 4 the change in concentration was used as an estimate of the effectiveness of the grassy swale or water quality basin at removing pollutants the different types of vegetated pretreatment a grassy swale at the cy vs a water quality basin with varied vegetation at sdb were reflected in the different degrees of contaminant reduction the change in total suspended sediment which adsorbs many organics and metals was 63 at the cy and 50 at sdb the estimate of removal efficiency is likely most valid for total suspended solids due to the larger sample size 3 4 vadose zone modeling corporation yard the contaminants selected for modeling at the cy and the sdb were a combination of those detected in stormwater at each location and two pesticides of emerging concern fipronil and imidacloprid in the most likely scenario modeled for the cy site table 4 the input concentration for half of the contaminants modeled was so low that the groundwater concentration would not exceed the reporting limit within the modeling timeframe of 500 years contaminants that fell into this group included aluminum di ethyl hexyl phthalate dehp and permethrin a commonly used pyrethroid for example aluminum was predicted to arrive at the water table at a concentration 1 of its input concentration after 265 years but would be unlikely to reach the analytical reporting limit due to its low input concentration in contrast fipronil and iron were predicted to arrive at the water table at measurable concentrations after 6 and 18 years respectively a third group of contaminants those that are water soluble reached the water table over the course of days to weeks for example imidacloprid and tert butyl alcohol tba were shown to reach quantifiable levels after 85 and 129 days respectively the worst case scenario high hydraulic conductivity and high solubility of the contaminant results for the cy site modeling showed most contaminants reach reporting limits at the water table after a period of days to years table 4 the rate of transport of aluminum was slow it would likely take hundreds of years to reach the water table the other modeled metals and pyrethroids moved more rapidly through the vadose zone reaching the water table in between 5 and 17 years the water soluble contaminants would reach reporting limits at the water table between 10 and 133 days included in table 5 for comparison are the results of running a conservative tracer through the model domains all chemical parameters for the conservative tracer were set to 0 to represent transport through the domain without any retardation dispersion or degradation 3 5 vadose zone modeling strawberry detention basin a slightly different group of contaminants were modeled at the sdb than at the cy reflecting differences in pollutants detected table 6 the ubiquitous pyrethroid pesticide bifenthrin was regularly measured at elevated concentrations in stormwater at sdb given its hydrophobicity it was the least mobile of all those modeled at sdb predicted to take about 470 years to reach a reportable concentration at the water table under the average case scenario the concentration would likely reach about 3 ng l after 500 years while using worst case scenario assumptions the concentration would reach its influent concentration of 99 ng l in 5 years at sdb under the average case scenario the water soluble contaminants are predicted to have greatly reduced transport times imidacloprid and fipronil were shown to reach the water table in about three months and seven years respectively tba was shown to take fewer than 20 days of travel time all the other monitored contaminants are never shown to reach sufficiently high concentrations to be reportable the worst case scenario results at the sdb site differed from the cy in that all contaminants would likely reach reportable concentrations in less than 50 years table 6 most notably imidcacloprid and tba were shown to reach the aquifer in 3 days and fipronil in 18 days 3 6 vadose zone modeling los angeles a different group of contaminants drawn from regional stormwater data were modeled for the hypothetical los angeles california usa scenarios the pollutant list included contaminants such as benzo a pyrene naphthalene and zinc that were frequently reported in the stormwater literature from the los angeles region tiefenthaler et al 2008 stein et al 2006 the average scenario modeling results indicated that all but one of the contaminants would not reach concentrations above criteria values table 7 four contaminants were predicted to reach the water table at detectable concentrations within 15 years copper fipronil imidacloprid and naphthalene after 15 years 3 years 34 days and 188 days respectively in contrast under the worst case scenario modeling showed that contaminants reach the water table much more rapidly and achieved higher concentrations than estimated for the average case table 7 for example benzo a pyrene b a p traveled through the unsaturated zone which was 80 sand in three months compared to 250 years in the average case scenario close to a 1000 fold difference similar comparisons can be made for copper where a greater than 200 fold difference was calculated a 90 fold difference for lead and bifenthrin the most hydrophobic of the modeled contaminants was predicted to never reach a reportable value compared to a 48 day travel time in the worst case scenario it appeared that the greater the hydrophobicity of the contaminant the larger the contrast between the influence of the two subsurface profiles on transport time however with the two water soluble pesticides the differences were considerably less it is worth noting that with the exception of b a p none of the concentrations of contaminants reached their respective criteria values e g mcl phg or other benchmark 4 discussion 4 1 contaminants in stormwater the presence of contaminants in stormwater in the united states has been widely documented for over 50 years the concern regarding stormwater has historically been focused on the adverse impacts on aquatic life a large body of literature exists on the classes sources and effects of contaminants on aquatic life brown and peake 2006 kuivila et al 2012 weston and lydy 2012 budd et al 2015 pitt et al 1999 maestre and pitt 2006 however more recently additional concerns regarding the harmful effects of stormwater contaminants on groundwater has been the focus of considerable interest due to efforts to infiltrate stormwater to reduce the effects of hydromodifications on urban waterways as well as use it as a source of groundwater replenishment nrc 2009 given the history of groundwater contamination associated with industrial and commercial site and on military installations and the lack of nationwide information the united states geologic survey conducted a comprehensive study of 50 runoff events at over 20 sites in the united states their data showed that stormwater entrains pesticides pharmaceuticals pahs as well as a variety of industrial and household chemicals masoner et al 2019 of the 438 organic chemicals analyzed their average detection rate was greater than 70 in contrast to findings of masoner and others we found surprisingly few organic contaminants detected in stormwater samples at the two study sites in elk grove fewer than 10 of the contaminants analyzed at any one sampling event were be detected above their reporting limit this appears to be due to a few factors one is the fact that most of the contaminant analysis was performed on samples collected after pretreatment due to the high cost of analytical chemistry on only two occasions were untreated stormwater samples collected most were collected at the dry well after pretreatment had occurred so it was expected that the concentrations of contaminants would be lower than untreated runoff however even the two untreated stormwater samples contained fewer than 10 contaminants above their reporting limits the two study sites a residential neighborhood and at a bus parking servicing area are common urban land uses that have been associated to varying degrees with contaminated stormwater ssqp 2017 maestre and pitt 2006 stein et al 2006 influent stormwater at these sites contained few polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons e g pyrene fluoranthene phthalates and benzo a pyrene and volatile organics e g carbon tetrachloride chloroform and toluene in contrast pyrethroid total petroleum hydrocarbons and metals were regularly detected the low frequency of detections could under report the actual frequency because of the small sample size given that the first year of the study occurred during a major drought in california one might expect contaminants to build up on the landscape in the absence of rain and be released into stormwater at higher than average concentrations during subsequent average or wet years however this was not reflected in the monitoring results possibly due to the hydrophobicity of pahs combustion by products are a major source of urban organic contaminants summarized in edwards et al 2016 stein et al 2006 so we expected elevated concentrations at the city s corporation yard however unlike many bus fleets elk grove s buses are fueled with natural gas which is known to produce lower emissions than diesel fueled buses nylund et al 2004 this could account for the low number of detections of pahs and other urban organics associated with vehicle exhaust at the cy on the other hand pyrethroids and motor oil were consistently measured at the drywells among the pyrethroids bifenthrin was reported most frequently other pyrethroids such as cyfluthrin and cyhalothrin were detected less frequently consistent with previous reports weston et al 2005 stormwater collected at the sdb drywell showed more frequent detections of pyrethroids than samples from the cy given that bifenthrin is one of the most widely used pyrethroids for the control of ants and other insects in residential and commercial settings weston et al 2005 these findings are not surprising other studies in the region have shown median concentrations of bifenthrin similar to what we observed at sdb weston and lydy 2012 ssqp 2017 motor oil and to a lesser degree a handful of volatile organics such as acetone and tert butyl alcohol were also detected at elevated concentrations at the cy in influent stormwater but this group of organics were seen only at very low levels at sdb none were detected in groundwater at either site metals have been commonly reported in urban stormwater runoff tiefenthaler et al 2008 sacramento stormwater quality partnership 2013 while numerous metals were detected at both study sites most were below their reporting limits one exception was aluminum which was detected at up to a three fold greater concentration than the 1 ppm regulatory standard at the cy given the fact that aluminum is present in the highest concentration of any metal in the earth s crust and that aluminum is a common contaminant at locations where vehicles are housed federal register 1996 it is possible that the source of these elevated concentration was dirt that had been rinsed from the undercarriage and tires of buses 4 2 contaminants in groundwater in general there was a lack of a relationship between the contaminants in stormwater and those found in groundwater for example small concentrations of cyfluthrin a pyrethroid were detected in stormwater with the exception of a low level detection of cyfluthrin in groundwater at sdb prior to the installation of the dry well none was detected in groundwater numerous other organic contaminants including methylphenol dichlorobenzidine benzofluouranthene benzo a pyrene and multiple phthalates data not shown were detected in stormwater below the reporting limit and above the detection limit so were not quantifiable but none were detected in either vadose zone or water table wells similarly there was little to suggest that dry wells facilitated the movement of anthropogenic metals into groundwater while aluminum exceeded the regulatory standard on two occassions and exceeded the public health goal of 600 μg l on multiple occasions in both an upgradient and downgradient monitoring well the fact that none was detected in the vadose zone well and that elevated concentrations were seen in both upgradient and downgradient wells suggests the source of aluminum in groundwater was unlikely to be linked to effluent from the dry wells furthermore modeling results suggest that at the cy even in scenarios with higher domain hydraulic ocnductivity values the travel time for this contaminant to reach the public health goals health based advisory standards at the water table would be over 330 years at sdb the median concentration of iron in the vadose zone or upgradient wells was at or below the reporting limit but iron was detected on two occasions in both downgradient wells modeling results suggest travel time to the water table would be five years so it is unlikely these detections were related to dry well effluent external sources legacy metals in the surrounding soils or desorption of naturally occuring iron could account for these findings the fact that elevated concentrations of iron are commonly reported in drinking water in the region supports this interpretation elk grove water service 2016 similarly elevated concentrations of aluminum 110 640 μg l have been reported multiple times in monitoring and water supply well samples in the area california state water resources control board 2018 other metals including boron manganese antimony lead copper and zinc were also detected at low levels in stormwater but not in groundwater 4 3 role of vadose zone attenuation vadose zone modeling suggests a reason few of the 200 plus contaminants analyzed were detected in groundwater samples there is an abundant amount of clay in the unsaturated zones surrounding the dry wells 28 at the cy and 52 at sdb which appeared to have limited the movement of organic and metal contaminants both dry wells were completed above or in a clay unit forcing runoff to leave the dry well through holes in the sides and releasing the water into clay compared to sand or silt clay has a high adsorptive capacity due its large surface areas 10 m2 g and reactive surface functional groups essington 2015 clay appeared to attenuate the movement of pollutants via sorption as reflected by the consistent difference between contaminant concentrations in water entering the dry well and concentrations collected from vadose zone and water table monitoring wells when lindemann 1999 sampled the subsurface material below the dry well he found consistently elevated concentrations of pahs in some cases many times greater concentrations than in the influent stormwater suggesting sequestration of pollutants in the vadose zone taken together these findings point to the important role the vadose zone plays in pollutant attenuation this importance is reflected in the policy of some states in the united states where the composition of the vadose zone is used as one of two key factors the other being stormwater contaminant concentration used to determine the type of pretreatment required at a dry well installation washington state department of ecology 2006 the key role the vadose zone plays in attenuation can be most easily seen when comparing the worst case with the average case scenario in los angeles table 7 the vadose zone profile of the average case los angeles conditions was very simiar to the two sites in elk grove all three containing less than 50 sand the distance to the water table at sdb is about the same as the worst case scenario profile in los angeles both less than 3 m the key difference between the two is the sand content 46 at sdb and 80 for worst case conditions in los angeles the effect of the high amount of sand in la resulted in a decrease in the travel time the difference in the peak concentration at the water table after 500 years was much less prominent with the biggest differences seen for the contaminants with the highest koc values such as b a p and bifenthrin the greater percentage of sediment with higher foc value increased the contaminant sorption occuring within the model domain thereby decreasing the amount of the contaminant that reached the water table the model results for contaminants with high kd or koc values can be compared to the results obtained for contaminants that do not readily sorb in the subsurface tba has a koc value orders of magnitude lower than the other modeled contaminants and when multiplied by the foc values of the model domain sediment its kd was close to zero making its travel times comparable to that of the modeled conservative tracer the results showing greater contamination in higher permeability cases is not surprising and is consistent with reports of others bandeen 1987 used unsat 2 to estimate the migration of stormwater through an unsaturated zone composed primarily of highly permeable material e g gravel case 1 one composed of gravel underlain by sandy loam case 2 and a third that was a mix of sand and gravel underlain by sandy clay loam case 3 the migration time through the 100 ft deep vadose zone was over 90 fold faster in case 1 compared to case 3 the authors concluded that a multi layered subsurface profile with a significant amounts of clay would provide the maximum attenuation barraud et al 1999 found that coarse material in the subsurface was ineffective at attenuating metals in stormwater similarly wogsland 1988 in a field study of two dry wells concluded that clay and amorphous oxides were very effective at attenuating metals oil and grease additional research efforts summarized by edwards et al 2016 have drawn similar conclusions knowledge of the vadose zone lithology is a key factor in estimating risk to groundwater quality further vadose zone profiles that contain clay are effective at attenuating contaminant migration and reducing the risk of groundwater contamination the important role of clay layers shown by the model assumes that these layers are laterally extensive and not just small lenses or inclined toward the water table allowing infiltrating water to find alternative preferential pathways through connected sands and gravels in these heterogeneous alluvial sediments it has been shown that preferential layer dipping can generate lateral gradients that allow water to recharge the water table faster than in the case of large lateral essentially flat stratigraphic layers especially clay layers kung 1990 mccord et al 1991 laterally less extensive flat lying low permeability inclusions lead to lateral spreading e g russo et al 1994 harter and yeh 1996 for a dry well with an annual discharge rate qdry well the minimum extent r from a well of an essentially flat lying local clay inclusion large enough to absorb the full dry well discharge can be computed by postulating that 1 q dry well q clay where qclay is the vertical discharge rate through the clay lens under saturated unit gradient gravity discharge conditions qclay can be computed from darcy s law 2 q clay a k clay 1 π r 2 k clay where k clay is the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity of clay a is a minimum circular clay lens area with radius r from the well it then follows that 3 r sqrt q dry well π k clay for qdry well 1000 m3 a 1 and kclay 10 1 m a 1 the minimum distance from the well to which a sufficiently protective clay lens must extend is on the order of 102 m or more as stated previously estimated mean lengths of the hydrofacies in the study area are 100 to 400 m meirovitz et al 2017 maples et al 2019 the laterally extensive layering conditions assumed in the one dimensional unsaturated zone flow and transport model are therefore not unrealistic in the examples simulated it is worth noting that even for the worst case scenario conditions in los angeles where bifenthrin concentration at the water table was estimated to reach 100 ng l after 500 years data not shown this contaminant s concentration is unlikely to pose a risk to human health risk to health was assessed by calculating the health protective concentration hpc of bifenthrin using the methodology employed to develop public health goals phg in california was estimated to be 314 μg l phgs are drinking water standards that are based solely on risk to human health oehha 2021 health protective concentrations were calculated since regulatory standards or phgs have not been established in the us in australia where drinking water guidelines for bifenthrin currently exists the standard is 0 2 mg l nhrmc and nrmmc 2011 both of these criteria values are orders of magnitude greater than the modeled concentration thus the health risk posed by bifenthrin is quite small taken together few contaminants were found in samples collected at the water table often detections were observed but they were mostly below the reporting limits for the majority of the contaminants that were analyzed by modeling their concentration would never reach a level approaching a health advisory standard such as the california public health goal or a us notification level nl under the most likely case scenarios these include metals and dehp under worst case scenario conditions however iron would reach the secondary regulatory standard for taste after as few as 5 years at cy or 190 days at sdb tert butyl alcohol would reach the nl within days other contaminants such as fipronil and imidacloprid would not reach their respective health protective concentrations it is difficult to validate modeling results for the two dry well sites given the short duration of water quality monitoring and the fact that any contaminants derived from dry well infiltration that arrive at the water table mixed with the groundwater diluting the concentrations of whatever pollutants were present as noted earlier the majority of the contaminants that were modeled were not predicted to reach the water table within the time period of the field study of the four contaminants that were predicted to reach detectable levels at the water table within the two year period under worst case scenario conditions two fipronil and imidacloprid were not measured in groundwater or stormwater samples the third tba was predicted to reach detectable levels at both sites within 12 days in the case of iron after 190 days at the sdb site tba wasn t detected in groundwater during the monitoring period this may be because mixing of dry well effluent with groundwater diluted the influent tba concentration to below reporting limits the fourth contaminant was iron it was frequently detected in stormwater and groundwater and was detected at significant concentrations downgradient of the sdb dry well iron was detected at low concentration but in a groundwater sample taken from a downgradient well in february 2015 it was also detected above its secondary mcl in upgradient and downgradient groundwater in september 2015 higher concentration downgradient after which it was not detected in sdb groundwater again the detection of iron is consistent with the results of the vadose zone modeling 4 4 role of pretreatment on average concentrations of a representative group of five organic and metal contaminants were reduced by 50 as a result of passage through the water quality basin at sdb and by 67 as they passed through the grassy swale at the cy although the water quality basin was much larger than the swale vegetation was more irregular and preferential flow pathways permitted water to reach the dry well with less than optimal pretreatment in contrast the grassy swale consisted of smooth long grass within a deep swale that retained water for 5 15 min prior to entering the sedimentation well this pretreatment was effective for most contaminants for example the median concentration of aluminum declined about three fold as it passed throμgh the grassy swale many other contaminants followed this pattern including bifenthrin motor oil acetone and aluminum not all data shown our findings are consistent with reports in the literature adolfson 1995 compared the pretreatment features of three different dry well systems with no pretreatment with a structural pretreatment only a sedimentation well and with both a grassy swale and a sedimentation well it was found that the greatest pollutant removal occurred with the third design where the removal efficiency was greater than 80 in some cases reports in the international stormwater bmp database 2016 suggest that a grassy swale typically removes about 30 of total suspended solids on which contaminants are frequently adsorbed the swale at the cy removed about double that amount approximately 63 of suspended solids these results highlight the importance of including a pretreatment feature in a dry well system unfortunately the other portion of the pretreatment train the 1 5 m deep sedimentation wells were insufficiently deep to optimize deposition of sediment particles little sediment was ever observed at the bottom of either sed well further commercial and municipal sedimentation wells are typically 3 to 4 5 m deep in order to provide sufficient depth for the settling of suspended material torrent resources phoenix az usa bureua of environmental services city of portland or usa 2006 given that most of the contaminants of concern in this study are particle bound this can be an efficient way to remove not only particles which can clog a dry well over time but also contaminants clark and pitt 2007 wilson et al 1989 olson 1987 adolfson 1995 and other studies reviewed by edwards et al 2016 found efficient removal of suspended sediment and pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons oil and grease multiple phthalates and most metals in these chambers there does not appear to be any literature that examines the attenuation potential of grassy swales on water soluble pesticides but it is doubtful if structural pretreament would be efficient for water solubles nonetheless for the majority of contaminants structural pretreatment has been found reduce pollutant load 4 5 contaminants of special concern nitrate is one example of a pollutant that is notoriously difficult to manage it was one of the few other contaminants that were detected at elevated concentrations in groundwater nitrate concentration in stormwater was consistently below the concentration found in groundwater at both study sites at sdb where groundwater concentrations of nitrate exceeded the mcl there were no significant differences between the upgradient and downgradient nitrate concentrations suggesting that infiltration through the dry wells was not a major source although it could have been a contributor given the historical use of this area for agriculture it is likely that nitrate accumulated in the unsaturated zone and has been leaching to groundwater for decades e g harter et al 2017 nitrate is difficult to manage with vegetated features constructed wetlands are a frequently used option for removal of nitrogen in urban stormwater and agricultural runoff vyazal 2007 however processes in the dry well s pretreatment basin which remain wet only during rain events are likely different from wetland conditions due to its water solubility intl bmp database 2016 neither bioretention cells nor grassy swales have been shown to be effective at attenuating nitrate in fact the concentration of nitrate is often greater leaving a bioretention cell than when it entered primarily due to nitrification li and davis 2014 in the sacramento region nitrate nitrite in stormwater has been consistently less than 1 mg l over the past 15 years considerably below the regulatory standard of 10 mg l for nitrate n ssqp 2017 similar concentrations have been reported in other parts of the u s li and davis 2014 however it appears that nitrogen concentrations in runoff are location specific for example a southern california study reported a median nitrate n concentration from lawns of 5 42 mg l toor et al 2017 due to the water solubility of nitrate the varying concentrations possible in stormwater its existing ubiquitousness in groundwater in many locations and its well documented toxicity to infants fewtrell 2004 special consideration is warranted in the selection of pretreatment and dry well siting to minimize its migration lastly our modeling results suggest that two water soluble pesticides neonicotinoids and fipronil moved relatively rapidly through the unsaturated zone these pesticides have been detected in urban runoff with increasing frequency teerlink 2017 california department of pesticide regulation 2016 masoner et al 2019 the modeling suggested they could move through the vadose zone in as little as 24 h los angeles scenario parameters included 2 m vertical separation in sandy soil up to as much as six to seven years at the elk grove sites research examining the mobility of these pesticides in soil has shown that the neonicotinoids are more mobile than fipronil primarily due to their high water solubility 610 mg l for imidacloprid vs 3 8 mg l for fipronil bonmatin et al 2015 their mobility is altered by the composition of soil organic carbon and clays act to attenuate these pesticides to varying degrees with little retention evident in sandy soils fossen 2006 teerlink 2017 because of their solubility the california department of pesticide regulation has placed imidacloprid on the groundwater protection list to date field studies have not been performed examining attenuation of these pesticides by various forms of pretreatment this is a area of research that needs further attention while the mobility of both neonicotinoids and fipronil pesticides raises concern their concentrations in stormwater are relatively low reducing the potential risk to drinking water quality masoner et al 2019 found the median concentration of imidacloprid in samples collected from 50 storm events was approximately 25 ng l the fipronil concentration was approximately 20 ng l these concentrations were a magnitude lower than the ones used for modeling in this study 0 9 and 0 5 μg l respectively the modeled concentrations reflected the higher end of values collected from sampling of stormwater in california conducted by the department of pesticide regulation in 2016 estimates of the concentration of these two pesticides at the water table after 500 years were compared to the health protective concentrations the hpc of imidacloprid is 358 μg l a value about 400 fold greater than the estimated concentration of 0 9 μg l at the water table this difference has a greater margin of safety compared to fipronil where the concentration for the average case scenario after 500 years at both sites was slightly more than half of the hpc of 1 19 μg l this calculation assumed that the concentration of the pesticide entering the dry well was the same as what would be found in drinking water assuming no dilution in the aquifer both are conservative assumptions considering the mobility and concentration in stormwater of these two pesticides it does not appear that either would pose a significant risk to the quality of drinking water or human health this could change in the future if the use of these classes of pesticides were to increase there clearly is a need to develop pretreatment facilities that could capture water soluble pesticides and nitrate methods to attenuate nitrate using nitrogen fixing plants such as alfalfa in vegetated features has been investigated kim et al 2003 these investigators found greater than 90 efficiency of removal of nitrate with alflalfa use in bioretention others are exploring the use of anion cation pillows that could be added to dry well systems to attenuate water soluble pesticides j mayer 2014 pers comm while the risk to human health will vary with specific conditions the need to better understand the behavior of these types of contaminants and identify ways to efficiently manage them would be worthwhile 4 6 risk of mobilizing naturally occurring toxic metals constituents in stormwater such as ions and certain metals have the potential to mobilize naturally occurring arsenic and chromium these two metals were regularly detected in groundwater but not in stormwater for example at both sites arsenic concentrations in stormwater were too low to quantify however it was detected in all groundwater wells at concentrations of 2 to 4 μg l in many locations in california and the southwestern usa in general arsenic is endemic in drinking water in the study region the median arsenic concentration in groundwater based on samples collected over the last 20 years was about 5 μg l half of the regulatory standard of 10 μg l however one public supply well less than a half mile from the cy site had a concentration of arsenic as high as 64 μg l in 2008 california state water resources control board 2018 arsenic is a minor component of granite a major geologic feature of the sierra nevada mountain range in eastern california and it is also present in metamorphic rocks often bound to iron complexes on the western slopes of the sierras under oxidizing conditions in the presence of iron arsenic is primarily retained in the solid phase a shift to reducing conditions however could cause arsenic to be released through a variety of mechanisms bose and sharma 2002 both ions such as sulfate or bicarbonate and metals contained in stormwater could alter the redox state thus mobilizing arsenic a weak positive correlation between iron and arsenic suggested that iron in stormwater effluent could cause a reduction of arsenic bearing iron oxides resulting in the mobilization of arsenic bose and sharma 2002 pierce and moore 1982 modeling results of the worst case scenario suggested that iron would reach the water table at the cy in about five years therefore in this two year study it was unlikely that stormwater effluent influenced the redox conditions the case was different at the sdb where iron was estimated to reach the water table within a few months yet no correlation was found between iron and arsenic at this site data not shown this could be due to the small sample size or the lack of a meaningful relationship while this short study produced no evidence of stormwater constituents mobilizing toxic metals other research suggests that this could occur jurgens et al 2008 found weak positive correlations between iron and dissolved arsenic in a study of the aquifer in modesto ca usa they also observed a positive correlation between select infiltrated metals and uranium concentration in groundwater further research would help clarify these relationships 5 conclusion this study presents the most comprehensive data and analysis to date on water quality phenomena associated with dry wells for over 200 potential contaminants at actual field sites the data include water quality sampling of not only the storm influent and dry well waters but also the surrounding vadose zone and underlying groundwater allowing a total system evaluation of possible water quality threats from these structures that are increasingly being considered for enhancement of groundwater recharge to address critical groundwater overdraft problems results suggest that using dry wells to infiltrate stormwater would pose minimal risk to groundwater quality when proper pretreatment is employed and source water does not contain potentially mobile groundwater contaminants most contaminants commonly found in urban runoff would either be attenuated in a pretreatment system or in the vadose zone for varying degrees of time ranging from decades to centuries the exceptions would be for highly water soluble non degradable and or possibly mobile contaminants such as nitrate usually found in low concentration in most urban runoff and water soluble pesticides such as the neonicotinoids this also includes the group of less mobile per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas which are an emerging contaminant of concern due to their long term persistence xiao et al 2015 research is needed to find new methods of pretreatment that assist in minimizing the risk of mobile or persistent water soluble pollutants leaching from dry wells additional research to quantify the capacity of the unsaturated zone to adsorb contaminants would also help clarify potential long term risks our field and modeling work suggests that given appropriate consideration for construction including pre treatment and siting dry wells

1334,the research presented herein investigates a peroxone activated persulfate pap oxidant commercialized under the trade name oxyzone and its effects on 1 4 dioxane dioxane contaminated water under column scale conditions in the presence of porous material there is a limited understanding of the underlying processes that govern pap oxidation including the oxidation rates in the presence of aquifer material and how these reactions proceed once the oxidant is injected into a contaminant plume initial batch experiments with porous material e g sand provided data on the reaction rates of dioxane oxidation as a function of the oxidant contaminant ratio the observed degradation rates were approximately 4 times lower than those reported for aqueous solutions containing no porous media subsequent column experiments simulated two pap injections schemes along the flowpath of a dioxane plume to study if the injection of one oxidant slug may yield different results than injecting the same oxidant volume at two separate locations the injection of one oxidant slug was found more effective resulting in near complete destruction of dioxane over a prolonged time at a rate more than an order of magnitude greater than in the two slug injection scenario tracer test results suggest that the prolonged oxidant reactivity was in part caused by the high density of the injected oxidant solution overall the results underline the importance of accounting for the properties of both the oxidant solution and the porous material when considering the injection of pap oxidant into an impacted aquifer keywords 1 4 dioxane in situ chemical oxidation remediation groundwater peroxone activated persulfate 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane dioxane is a heterocyclic ether historically used in many industrial products and processes including usage as a stabilizer or a wetting and dispersing agent for textile processing and printing anderson et al 2012 klečka and gonsior 1986 mohr et al 2020 chlorinated solvents such as 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca and trichloroethylene tce were commonly stabilized with dioxane mohr 2001 consequently dioxane often is detected at or near sites where poor handling and disposal practices of chlorinated solvents caused groundwater contamination dioxane was included in the third round of the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr3 to evaluate its persistence in the environment and potential exposure to drinking water reservoirs the ucmr3 detected dioxane in 21 of the 4864 public water systems and exceeded the health based reference concentration 0 35 μg l at 6 9 of these sites adamson et al 2017 the epa integrated risk information system states that cancer development could occur in 1 out of 1 000 000 people exposed to a concentration of 0 35 ppb dioxane over a lifetime us epa 2011 dioxane is recalcitrant contaminant that is resistant to most conventional remediation strategies its low octanol water partitioning coefficient kow and henry s law constant indicate that dioxane is fully miscible in water and highly unlikely to sorb to aquifer materials si table 1 this also means that dioxane readily dissolves into groundwater and is highly mobile within an aquifer the full miscibility of dioxane in water its low volatility and comparably great chemical stability means that conventional treatment technologies such as pump and treat soil vapor extraction or permanganate oxidation are largely ineffective diguiseppi et al 2016 diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 this is also true for naturally occurring biodegradation processes zhang et al 2017 and chemical reduction chiang et al 2016 and consequently result in large groundwater contaminant plumes abe 1999 jackson and dwarakanath 1999 ex situ treatment of dioxane contaminated groundwater is the most commonly used remediation method diguiseppi et al 2016 mohr 2001 mohr et al 2020 zenker et al 2003 but this approach can be highly expensive and challenging due to local site conditions hence alternative in situ remediation strategies such as advanced oxidation processes aops are being pursued a promising in situ treatment method is based on peroxone activated persulfate pap oxidation which is an aop proposed to degrade dioxane through facilitated radical production cashman et al 2019 eberle et al 2016 in general in situ chemical oxidation methods are desirable for their ability to treat groundwater without extraction broughton et al 2019 one promising in situ technique is chemical oxidation in situ chemical oxidation isco relies on the delivery of chemical oxidizing agents directly into the subsurface with the purpose of accelerating degredation process huling and pievetz 2006 commonly used oxidants include permanganate mno4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ozone o3 and activated persulfate s208 ferrarese et al 2008 rivas 2006 oxidation of targeted organic compounds is accomplished through hydrogen abstraction reactive oxygen species or radicals or electron removal as a result of the free radical chemistry however isco oxidants with the oxidation potential eh 2 v such as permanganate are considered ineffective for treating recalcitrant compounds such as dioxane tratnyek et al 2007 conversely activated persulfate is a promising remediation strategy for its increased solubility and stability as well as its high oxidation potential 2 8 v watts and teel 2006 huling pievetz 2006 there are several known mechanisms for activating persulfate including heat uv irradiation ultrasonication and electrochemical activation zhou et al 2019 iron activation using fe2 is one of the most commonly used activation agents but its effectiveness is limited in subsurface applications zhong et al 2015 this study looks at the effectiveness of oxyzone a pap developed by enchem engineering inc newton ma usa u s patent no 7 667 087 to degrade dioxane in subsurface contaminant plumes oxyzone is an enhanced aop that uses a buffered persulfate solution in conjunction with o3 and h2o2 for the treatment of organic compounds such as gasoline fuel oils chlorinated volatile organic compounds and pfas in soil and groundwater ball 2010 eberle et al 2016 the simultaneous activation of persulfate with o3 and h2o2 peroxone is an established activation process and it generates both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals cashman et al 2019 importantly it proved effective at reducing dioxane concentrations 2 μg l mohr et al 2020 eberle et al 2016 research also showed the successful degradation of dioxane into organic acids chitra et al 2012 felix navarro et al 2013 stefan and bolton 1999 yan et al 2018 disadvantages of using this aop include the potential for bromate formation and the need for destruction of unreacted o3 and h2o2 broughton et al 2019 woodard et al 2014 in general activated persulfate oxidants are a promising group of isco technologies siegrist et al 2011 yan et al 2018 but knowledge gaps exist regarding the in situ treatment of dioxane contaminated groundwater prior research demonstrated that oxyzone is capable of destroying dioxane together with its co contaminants namely 1 1 1 tca and tce in aqueous conditions eberle et al 2016 these studies also demonstrated prolonged oxidation of organic contaminants for up to 96 h eberle 2015 despite the known short lifespans of radicals manual 1999 the presence of both ozone and hydrogen peroxide in the pap results in the production of hydroxyl oh and sulfate so4 radicals during the oxidation of dioxane block et al 2004 cashman et al 2019 crimi and taylor 2007 furman et al 2010 prior studies from eberle et al determined that the rate of oxidation of a contaminant increases linearly with increasing persulfate concentration and the destruction process can be described by pseudo first order reaction kinetics when conducted in aqueous solutions eberle et al 2016 the principal objective of this study was to investigate the degradation of dioxane through oxidation with pap under dynamic flow through conditions in the presence of a porous matrix that mimic the in situ treatment of groundwater plumes initial batch experiments were conducted to determine dioxane degradation rates in the presence of homogenous quartz sand under static conditions and compared the rates to simple aqueous phase systems the performance of pap under dynamic flow through conditions was studied using a large scale column non reactive tracer tests characterized the physical transport behavior of the oxidant and the hydraulic properties of the column system two different oxidant injection schemes were investigated to compare the resulting aop performance the reaction rates of dioxane oxidation from both oxidant injection schemes were used to determine degradation rates at contaminated field sites the findings will aide in the planning and future testing of dioxane in situ treatment schemes under field conditions 2

was generated by saturating a phosphate buffered persulfate solution containing hydrogen peroxide with ozone at ambient temperatures the oxidant was produced fresh before each experiment in a semi batch reactor designed to ozonate 3 5 l of liquid the molar concentration of full strength oxidant solution was 0 252 mol l with respect to sodium persulfate the average orp of fresh pap solution was 738 mv ph 4 4 and electrical conductivity was 40 8 ms cm the density and viscosity of sodium persulfate solution was 1 036 kg l and 1 019 cp respectively 2 2 analytics dioxane concentrations were quantified with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer from shimadzu gcms qp2010se equipped with a restek rxi 624sil ms column 30 m 0 25 mm id 1 4 μm si table 2 aqueous samples were introduced through an oi analytical eclipse 4660 purge and trap sample connector equipped with a 7 tenax trap and a 25 ml sparging vessel si table 3 analysis of dioxane was performed in selected ion monitoring sim mode

freshly prepared oxidant solution was diluted with deionized di water to prepare solutions with molar oxidant contaminant ratios ranging from 0 1 100 1 250 1 500 1 to 1000 1 each vial was completely filled with their respective oxidant contaminant solution to eliminate headspace after agitation at 25 c for 24 h all reactions were quenched with 2 ml of 1 n sodium thiosulfate and refrigerated at 4 c until analysis haselow et al 2003 triplicate samples were taken for each oxidant contaminant ratio and averaged a second test using the oxidant contaminant ratio of 250 1 provided a more detailed understanding of the degradation kinetics at an extended timescale at this ratio the reaction was sufficiently slow to ensure that dioxane concentrations were measurable over a 16 day test duration as before 20 g of sand in 40 ml vials was spiked with 3 25 ml of dioxane stock solution the remaining vial volume was filled with oxidant solution to achieve a 250 1 m ratio of oxidant contaminant

thiosulfate triplicate samples were taken at each time step and averaged chemical kinetics were analyzed by measuring dioxane concentrations at each timestep all reactions were modeled as pseudo first order reactions due to a great excess of sodium persulfate in the pap solution relative to the dioxane concentration the rate constant k can be determined in pseudo first order reactions by plotting the natural log of c co versus time and identifying the slope of the as seen in eq 1 the reaction half life t½ was calculated as the inverse of k capellos and bielski 1972 1 d c co dt k c co 2 4 column experiments a large custom made column was used to quantify the dioxane degradation by oxidation under flow through conditions the column was constructed from a 152 4 cm section of clear polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe with 7 73 cm diameter everclear pvc with teflon lined pvc caps fitted with stainless steel compressional tube adapters swageloc on each end fig 1 the column was outfitted with three stainless steel septa ports swageloc for sample collection or oxidant injection ports a through c the column was tightly packed with accusand sand and topped with glass wool before capping

dimensionless concentrations c co and plotted as a function of pore volume pv brigham 1974 the corresponding data were quantified using the method of moments fetter et al 2017 to determine characteristics of the breakthrough curve btc after completing the column characterization the di water influent was replaced with an aqueous solution of 300 μg l dioxane 3 4 mm l to simulate a contaminant plume this concentration was chosen based on the screening level for dioxane epa iris reference dose us epa 2011 dioxane was continuously pumped through the column until concentration equilibrium was achieved after 36 h when cin cout 2 5 dioxane oxidation at column scale two treatment scenarios were evaluated at column scale in scenario 1 two slugs of oxidant solution of equal volume 100 ml each were injected simultaneously at ports a and c into the dioxane contaminated plume over 50 min q 2 0 ml min in scenario 2 one slug of the equal volume 200 ml or 0 01 pv of oxidant was injected into port a over 43 min q 4 6 ml min the dioxane plume moved at an average linear velocity of 0 45 cm min which is about one order of magnitude higher than typical flow rates of groundwater plumes at contaminated sites ec orp ph temperature and dioxane concentrations were monitored throughout the experiment using probe monitors and effluent measurements the persulfate concentration was monitored indirectly using ec as a proxy the duration of these experiments ranged from 2 to 3 days 3 results batch experiments determined the degradation rates of dioxane by pap in the presence of homogenized silica quartz sand under increasing oxidant contaminant ratios all oxidant contaminant batch experiments were executed in triplicate in all experiments the control experiments 0 1 oxidant contaminant ratio proved that insignificant 5 dioxane degradation took place in the absence of oxidant the rate by which the dioxane oxidation proceeds under water sediment batch conditions was estimated from initial 24 h experiments using molar concentration oxidant contaminant ratios ranging from 0 1 to 1000 1 the results from these experiments are considered estimates because these rates are based on only two time points per oxidant contaminant ratio the resulting pseudo first order reaction rates ranged from 0 0025 h 1 at 0 1 to 0 0946 h 1 at 1000 1 and increased with increasing oxidant contaminant ratios fig 2 si table 4 the corresponding half live times decreased from 277 h at 100 1 to 7 h at 1000 1 oxidant contaminant ratio the 250 1 oxidant contaminant ratio was selected for a second set of experiments at the 250 1 ratio the dioxane oxidation reaction progressed slowly enough to permit frequent measurements including orp and ph all time points were measured in triplicate for dioxane concentration si table 5 the resulting pseudo first order reaction rate was k 0 0213 h 1 r2 0 965 fig 3 si table 5 and the corresponding half life time was t½ 33 h column experiments were conducted to obtain an understanding of the dioxane treatment by oxidation under dynamic flow through conditions an initial conservative tracer test shows that the column was packed homogenously and that preferential flow was negligible the distribution and arrival of the tracer front was observed with minor delay 1 09pv and dispersion was minimal 0 08pv however for reasons unknown the tracer mass recovery was 20 higher than expected 3 1 scenario i oxidant slug injection into two ports oxidant solution 100 ml or about 0 05pv each was injected into ports a and c along the column length fig 1 column effluent samples were collected every 12 min for 20 h or 1 93pv the ec measurements show two distinct peaks at 0 58 pv and 0 96 pv clearly reflecting the breakthrough of the two oxidant slugs fig 4 the ec peak value of the slug arriving at 0 96pv is roughly twice as high as the initial slug 5230 μs cm versus 2990 μs cm at the end of the experiment the effluent ec 1991 μs cm remained well above the column influent ec 0 3 μs cm the ph at the time of breakthrough of the first oxidant slug was 6 5 and fell to 6 0 by the time the second slug arrived fig 4 it then rose to ph 6 2 and remained at that level for the remainder of the experiment the influent ph was 6 6 the orp at the breakthrough of the first oxidant slug was 420 mv and 480 mv at the breakthrough of the second slug orp then steadily declined to 357 mv until the end of the experiment at that time the orp was more than twice as high relative to the column influent orp 167 mv data shown in si unlike the ec the orp readings were not additive when the slugs overlap the zeroth moment m0 which shows an oxidant mass recovery was 76 table c3 at the termination of the experiment regarding the dioxane concentrations co 302 μg l effluent concentrations declined upon the breakthrough of the first oxidant slug fig 4 the concentrations decreased to 188 μg l c co 0 62 at the time when the second slug arrived 0 96pv concentrations then rose again to 234 μg l at the end of the experiment which was 23 below the dioxane influent concentration as illustrated in fig 5 the dioxane degradation rates k were calculated from the effluent concentration data at the breakthrough of the first and second oxidant slug the rates for the breakthroughs of the two slugs were similar table 1 si fig 2 first k 0 20 h 1 second k 0 18 h 1 the average half live time was t½ 3 66 h with reference to the rates determined during the batch experiments fig 3 the corresponding oxidant contaminant ratio during the oxidant breakthrough was close to 1000 1 for comparison the oxidant contaminant ratio of full strength pap oxidant solution applied in the field is at least ten times greater 3 2 scenario ii single oxidant slug in the second treatment scenario one slug of pap oxidant of the same volume 200 ml or 0 1pv was injected at the base of the column fig 5 column effluent samples were collected for 3 1 pv 22h the ec measurements indicate that the breakthrough of the oxidant slug occurred at 1pv the maximum ec measurement was 4850 mv at 1 34pv which was similar 7 3 less than the maximum ec recorded during scenario i afterward the ec values decreased in a linear fashion until 2 7pv when ec sharply decreased at the end of the experiment the ec of the column effluent was similar to the influent the rise in orp coincided with the rise in ec but unlike the ec the orp readings remained at a near constant level 335 mv until 2 7 pv after which they deceased at a similar rate as the ec at the end of the experiment orp effluent readings were similar to the influent ones regarding the ph it dropped from 6 1 to 5 4 at the oxidant breakthrough and remained at that level until the termination of the experiment fig 5 the concentration of dioxane entering the column was held constant at 287 μg l at 1 1pv the concentration in the column effluent dropped sharply to 14 μg l and fell below the limit of detection 3 μg l by 1 9pv the dioxane concentration began to rebound afterward but was still 87 below the corresponding column influent concentration when the experiment was terminated as in scenario i the oxidation rate of dioxane for this experiment was calculated from the rate of degradation at the breakthrough the pap oxidant the rate table 1 k 1 539 h 1 was the highest of any experiment the corresponding half live time was t½ 0 45 h table 1 and the oxidant contaminant ratio during the oxidant breakthrough was close to full strength oxyzone oxidant solution applied under field conditions given the comparably high density differential between the oxidant solution 1 036 kg l injected into the column and the simulated dioxane groundwater plume 1 000 kg l we investigated if the observed tailing can be explained by density driven transport processes for this purpose a second tracer test was conducted with a higher nacl concentration solution 67 g l to mimic the density of the pap oxidant solution as shown in fig 6 the shape of the breakthrough curve of this nacl solution was similar to that of the oxidant and distinctively different from the low concentration nacl tracer testy density 1 0 kg l the main difference between the higher density btc is that the nacl solution exhibited a longer tailing relative to the pap oxidant together these three btcs indicate that density driven transport delayed and prolonged the transport of the pap oxidant slug through the column under vertical up ward flow conditions 4 discussion the purpose of these experiments was to determine the degradation rate of dioxane using pap oxidation in the presence of porous media oxidation rates and reaction kinetics were derived for varying oxidant contaminant ratios in batch scale studies to better understand how the porous media affects dioxane oxidation rates similar studies by eberle 2015 determined the rates of dioxane oxidation based on the same pap oxidant oxyzone as studied herein but with experiments conducted in aqueous solution only fig 3 the oxidation rates calculated in our research are 3 4 times slower than the rates reported by eberle et al 2015 although the underlying causes were not further investigated this observation suggests that previously reported aqueous phase rates likely overestimate how quickly the pap oxidant degrades dioxane when injected into a polluted aquifer therefore our results underline the importance of accounting for the porous material and its properties when planning for an injection of oxidant into a polluted aquifer or ex situ materials the column scale studies were only conducted once per scenario our investigation was limited to these two scenarios and did not explore the effects of different soil properties the influence of these properties are not easily estimated and have to be evaluated in further experiments 4 1 column scale experiments at real world contaminated sites dioxane is predominantly present in a dissolved state and forms elongated plumes of contaminated groundwater adamson et al 2014 hence its in situ treatment would likely require the injection of a solution containing a reactive agent such as the pap oxidant two different oxidant injection scenarios were tested in this study in scenario i oxidant slugs were injected at two locations along the main axis of the simulated dioxane plume in scenario ii only one oxidant slug but of the same volume as in scenario ii was injected into the base of the column prior to these experiments a conservative tracer test confirmed that flow field was homogenous and not influenced by preferential pathways which could have distorted the breakthrough curves of the dioxane and related parameters ec orp ph 4 2 scenario i the oxidant solution breakthrough occurs when the dioxane effluent concentration dropped to c co 0 62 and the orp remained consistently 5000 μs cm fig 4 although the dioxane concentration rose again while the tailing end of the oxidant eluted from the column it never reached the influent concentration co for the remainder of the experiment the apparent continued contaminant destruction during the later stages of the experiment correlates with the continued presence of oxidant in the column as indicated by the still elevated orp at the end of the experiment this suggests that the remaining oxidant fraction 24 based on the final mass recovery calculation moved more slowly through the column and continued to oxidize the dissolved dioxane past the time expected for a non reactive solute the ec data confirmed that the oxidant exhibited conservative transport characteristics in that they both arrived at the expected time 0 58pv first slug injected half way through the column and 0 96pv for the second slug the peak ec value of the second slug to 5230 μs cm at 0 96pv corresponded to an 12 oxidant concentration relative to the originally injected solution whereas at its peak the first slug was at 7 2990 μs cm at 0 58pv these results suggest that the slug injected at the inlet of the column must have caught up and overlapped with the slug injected halfway 0 75 m equivalent of 0 5 pv through the column unlike the ec readings the elevated orp readings after breakthrough of the first slug were not additive but remained constant within a narrow range when the second slug arrived fig 4 the similarity in orp is also reflected in the observed dioxane degradation rates which were similar during the arrival of the first and second oxidant slug 0 099 h 1 and 0 116 h 1 respectively these observations together suggest that there is no immediate benefit in terms of oxidation power by overlapping slugs of similar strength further it must be noted that the ec was used as a proxy of the pap oxidant concentration the fact that ec readings were additive and orp were not indicates that a fraction of the persulfate was consumed during the dioxane oxidation and converted to sulfate this conversion led to a reduction in the oxidation power of the oxidant but did not decrease the ec of the bulk solution this assessment is further supported when converting the observed dioxane degradation rates to the corresponding oxidant contaminant ratio of 1150 1 fig 2 which was 8 7 of the injected pap oxidant 10 000 1 ball 2010 the corresponding ec data indicates an apparent oxidant concentration of 12 the lower percentage derived from the oxidant contaminant ratio suggests that approximately 25 of the persulfate oxidant was converted to sulfate the scenario i test further demonstrated that the observed ph decline correlated with the rise in orp this result was expected because as the oxidant advances indicated by the rising orp sulfate so4 2 is produced by the persulfate reaction sulfate is a weak conjugate base which leads to the production of sulfuric acid the formation of sulfuric acid is partially buffered by the phosphate buffer which is part of this oxidant formulation although sufficient acid was produced to lower the ph to 6 5 a ph in that range would not be require an adjustment of the oxidant s buffer strength under real world conditions boving and ball 2020 4 3 scenario ii the injection of one slug at the base of the column was more effective than injecting two slugs as seen in scenario i the data shows near complete destruction of dioxane over a prolonged time approximately 1 7pv fig 5 the rate of destruction was more than an order of magnitude greater than in either scenario i or the batch experiments table 1 in fact the rate was very close to estimated degradation rate of full strength pap oxidant in contact with a porous medium although the dioxane degradation proceeded faster in the one slug scenario that in scenario i the results further underline the effect of the porous material during isco treatment while the observed prolonged effectiveness of the oxidant as indicated by consistently elevated orp even after the termination of the experiment can be considered beneficial for the in situ treatment this outcome was unexpected the data from a tracer test using a nacl solution with similar density to the pap oxidant suggests that the movement of the oxidant solution through the porous media was partially density driven that is the density contrast between the injected oxidant solution and the simulated groundwater plume was sufficiently large so that the oxidant slug resisted the transport by advection for some time until dispersion and dilution overcame the density differential the overall effect was a retardation of oxidant through the column which explains the observed apparent retardation of the oxidant and its prolonged reactivity it is unlikely that the observed density driven transport processed can be easily translated into an advantageous treatment scheme because it would the modification of groundwater flow to an upward direction it is however possible to inject the oxidant solution at or near the top of a polluted water table aquifer and then exploit the comparable high density of the oxidant solution to slowly finding its way into deeper parts of the aquifer such a scheme would require further testing and simulation beforehand but it potentially could result in cost savings related to fewer less deep injection wells and fewer oxidant injection events 5 conclusion this study investigates the degradation of 1 4 dioxane by pap oxidant in batch scale and column scale studies the batch scale studies establish oxidation rates for pap oxidation of dioxane in sand and proves that porous material significantly reduces the speed of oxidation the column scale studies examine the same oxidation processes under dynamic flow through conditions that mimic in situ treatment of groundwater plumes the results of this study confirm that pap oxidant effectively destroys dioxane in situ albeit at a lower rate compared to treating dioxane polluted water ex situ injecting pap solution into a dioxane contaminated plume appears as a promising isco technology but further research is needed to determine how density driven transport affects in situ remediation strategies author contributions all authors contributed equally to the conceptualization of the project cashman ball and boving were the main contributors to the

1334,the research presented herein investigates a peroxone activated persulfate pap oxidant commercialized under the trade name oxyzone and its effects on 1 4 dioxane dioxane contaminated water under column scale conditions in the presence of porous material there is a limited understanding of the underlying processes that govern pap oxidation including the oxidation rates in the presence of aquifer material and how these reactions proceed once the oxidant is injected into a contaminant plume initial batch experiments with porous material e g sand provided data on the reaction rates of dioxane oxidation as a function of the oxidant contaminant ratio the observed degradation rates were approximately 4 times lower than those reported for aqueous solutions containing no porous media subsequent column experiments simulated two pap injections schemes along the flowpath of a dioxane plume to study if the injection of one oxidant slug may yield different results than injecting the same oxidant volume at two separate locations the injection of one oxidant slug was found more effective resulting in near complete destruction of dioxane over a prolonged time at a rate more than an order of magnitude greater than in the two slug injection scenario tracer test results suggest that the prolonged oxidant reactivity was in part caused by the high density of the injected oxidant solution overall the results underline the importance of accounting for the properties of both the oxidant solution and the porous material when considering the injection of pap oxidant into an impacted aquifer keywords 1 4 dioxane in situ chemical oxidation remediation groundwater peroxone activated persulfate 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane dioxane is a heterocyclic ether historically used in many industrial products and processes including usage as a stabilizer or a wetting and dispersing agent for textile processing and printing anderson et al 2012 klečka and gonsior 1986 mohr et al 2020 chlorinated solvents such as 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca and trichloroethylene tce were commonly stabilized with dioxane mohr 2001 consequently dioxane often is detected at or near sites where poor handling and disposal practices of chlorinated solvents caused groundwater contamination dioxane was included in the third round of the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr3 to evaluate its persistence in the environment and potential exposure to drinking water reservoirs the ucmr3 detected dioxane in 21 of the 4864 public water systems and exceeded the health based reference concentration 0 35 μg l at 6 9 of these sites adamson et al 2017 the epa integrated risk information system states that cancer development could occur in 1 out of 1 000 000 people exposed to a concentration of 0 35 ppb dioxane over a lifetime us epa 2011 dioxane is recalcitrant contaminant that is resistant to most conventional remediation strategies its low octanol water partitioning coefficient kow and henry s law constant indicate that dioxane is fully miscible in water and highly unlikely to sorb to aquifer materials si table 1 this also means that dioxane readily dissolves into groundwater and is highly mobile within an aquifer the full miscibility of dioxane in water its low volatility and comparably great chemical stability means that conventional treatment technologies such as pump and treat soil vapor extraction or permanganate oxidation are largely ineffective diguiseppi et al 2016 diguiseppi and whitesides 2007 this is also true for naturally occurring biodegradation processes zhang et al 2017 and chemical reduction chiang et al 2016 and consequently result in large groundwater contaminant plumes abe 1999 jackson and dwarakanath 1999 ex situ treatment of dioxane contaminated groundwater is the most commonly used remediation method diguiseppi et al 2016 mohr 2001 mohr et al 2020 zenker et al 2003 but this approach can be highly expensive and challenging due to local site conditions hence alternative in situ remediation strategies such as advanced oxidation processes aops are being pursued a promising in situ treatment method is based on peroxone activated persulfate pap oxidation which is an aop proposed to degrade dioxane through facilitated radical production cashman et al 2019 eberle et al 2016 in general in situ chemical oxidation methods are desirable for their ability to treat groundwater without extraction broughton et al 2019 one promising in situ technique is chemical oxidation in situ chemical oxidation isco relies on the delivery of chemical oxidizing agents directly into the subsurface with the purpose of accelerating degredation process huling and pievetz 2006 commonly used oxidants include permanganate mno4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 ozone o3 and activated persulfate s208 ferrarese et al 2008 rivas 2006 oxidation of targeted organic compounds is accomplished through hydrogen abstraction reactive oxygen species or radicals or electron removal as a result of the free radical chemistry however isco oxidants with the oxidation potential eh 2 v such as permanganate are considered ineffective for treating recalcitrant compounds such as dioxane tratnyek et al 2007 conversely activated persulfate is a promising remediation strategy for its increased solubility and stability as well as its high oxidation potential 2 8 v watts and teel 2006 huling pievetz 2006 there are several known mechanisms for activating persulfate including heat uv irradiation ultrasonication and electrochemical activation zhou et al 2019 iron activation using fe2 is one of the most commonly used activation agents but its effectiveness is limited in subsurface applications zhong et al 2015 this study looks at the effectiveness of oxyzone a pap developed by enchem engineering inc newton ma usa u s patent no 7 667 087 to degrade dioxane in subsurface contaminant plumes oxyzone is an enhanced aop that uses a buffered persulfate solution in conjunction with o3 and h2o2 for the treatment of organic compounds such as gasoline fuel oils chlorinated volatile organic compounds and pfas in soil and groundwater ball 2010 eberle et al 2016 the simultaneous activation of persulfate with o3 and h2o2 peroxone is an established activation process and it generates both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals cashman et al 2019 importantly it proved effective at reducing dioxane concentrations 2 μg l mohr et al 2020 eberle et al 2016 research also showed the successful degradation of dioxane into organic acids chitra et al 2012 felix navarro et al 2013 stefan and bolton 1999 yan et al 2018 disadvantages of using this aop include the potential for bromate formation and the need for destruction of unreacted o3 and h2o2 broughton et al 2019 woodard et al 2014 in general activated persulfate oxidants are a promising group of isco technologies siegrist et al 2011 yan et al 2018 but knowledge gaps exist regarding the in situ treatment of dioxane contaminated groundwater prior research demonstrated that oxyzone is capable of destroying dioxane together with its co contaminants namely 1 1 1 tca and tce in aqueous conditions eberle et al 2016 these studies also demonstrated prolonged oxidation of organic contaminants for up to 96 h eberle 2015 despite the known short lifespans of radicals manual 1999 the presence of both ozone and hydrogen peroxide in the pap results in the production of hydroxyl oh and sulfate so4 radicals during the oxidation of dioxane block et al 2004 cashman et al 2019 crimi and taylor 2007 furman et al 2010 prior studies from eberle et al determined that the rate of oxidation of a contaminant increases linearly with increasing persulfate concentration and the destruction process can be described by pseudo first order reaction kinetics when conducted in aqueous solutions eberle et al 2016 the principal objective of this study was to investigate the degradation of dioxane through oxidation with pap under dynamic flow through conditions in the presence of a porous matrix that mimic the in situ treatment of groundwater plumes initial batch experiments were conducted to determine dioxane degradation rates in the presence of homogenous quartz sand under static conditions and compared the rates to simple aqueous phase systems the performance of pap under dynamic flow through conditions was studied using a large scale column non reactive tracer tests characterized the physical transport behavior of the oxidant and the hydraulic properties of the column system two different oxidant injection schemes were investigated to compare the resulting aop performance the reaction rates of dioxane oxidation from both oxidant injection schemes were used to determine degradation rates at contaminated field sites the findings will aide in the planning and future testing of dioxane in situ treatment schemes under field conditions 2

was generated by saturating a phosphate buffered persulfate solution containing hydrogen peroxide with ozone at ambient temperatures the oxidant was produced fresh before each experiment in a semi batch reactor designed to ozonate 3 5 l of liquid the molar concentration of full strength oxidant solution was 0 252 mol l with respect to sodium persulfate the average orp of fresh pap solution was

freshly prepared oxidant solution was diluted with deionized di water to prepare solutions with molar oxidant contaminant ratios ranging from 0 1 100 1 250 1 500 1 to 1000 1 each vial was completely filled with their respective oxidant contaminant solution to eliminate headspace after agitation at 25 c for 24 h all reactions were quenched with 2 ml of 1 n sodium thiosulfate and refrigerated at 4 c until analysis haselow et al 2003 triplicate samples were taken for each oxidant contaminant ratio and averaged a second test using the oxidant contaminant ratio of 250 1 provided a more detailed understanding of the degradation kinetics at an extended timescale at this ratio the reaction was sufficiently slow to ensure that dioxane concentrations were measurable over a 16 day test duration as before 20 g of sand in 40 ml vials was spiked with 3 25 ml of dioxane stock solution the remaining vial volume was filled with oxidant solution to achieve a 250 1 m ratio of oxidant contaminant

thiosulfate triplicate samples were taken at each time step and averaged chemical kinetics were analyzed by measuring dioxane concentrations at each timestep all reactions were modeled as pseudo first order reactions due to a great excess of sodium persulfate in the pap solution relative to the dioxane concentration the rate constant k can be determined in pseudo first order reactions by plotting the natural log of c co versus time and identifying the slope of the as seen in eq 1 the reaction half life t½ was calculated as the inverse of k capellos and bielski 1972 1 d c co dt k c co 2 4 column experiments a large custom made column was used to quantify the dioxane degradation by oxidation under flow through conditions the column was constructed from a 152 4 cm section of clear polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe with 7 73 cm diameter everclear pvc with teflon lined pvc caps fitted with stainless steel compressional tube adapters swageloc on each end fig 1 the column was outfitted with three stainless steel septa ports swageloc for sample collection or oxidant injection ports a through c the column was tightly packed with accusand sand and topped with glass wool before capping to prevent headspace and the escape of sand particles the column was mounted vertically to a wall the inlet at the bottom of the column was connected with 3 8 teflon tubing tygon leading to a peristaltic pump cole parmer gear pump system rn 74013 70 the column outlet on the top was also connected to 3 8 teflon tubing leading to the sample collection station the dimensions of the column

equilibrium was achieved after 36 h when cin cout 2 5 dioxane oxidation at column scale two treatment scenarios were evaluated at column scale in scenario 1 two slugs of oxidant solution of equal volume 100 ml each were injected simultaneously at ports a and c into the dioxane contaminated plume over 50 min q 2 0 ml min in scenario 2 one slug of the equal volume 200 ml or 0 01 pv of oxidant was injected into port a over 43 min q 4 6 ml min the dioxane plume moved at an average linear velocity of 0 45 cm min which is about one order of magnitude higher than typical flow rates of groundwater plumes at contaminated sites ec orp ph temperature and dioxane concentrations were monitored throughout the experiment using probe monitors and effluent measurements the persulfate concentration was monitored indirectly using ec as a proxy the duration of these experiments ranged from 2 to 3 days 3 results batch experiments determined the degradation rates of dioxane by pap in the presence of homogenized silica quartz sand under increasing oxidant contaminant ratios all oxidant contaminant batch experiments were executed in triplicate in all experiments the control experiments 0 1 oxidant contaminant ratio proved that insignificant 5 dioxane degradation took place in the absence of oxidant the rate by which the dioxane oxidation proceeds under water sediment batch conditions was estimated from initial 24 h experiments using molar concentration oxidant contaminant ratios ranging from 0 1 to 1000 1 the results from these experiments are considered estimates because these rates are based on only two time points per oxidant contaminant ratio the resulting pseudo first order reaction rates ranged from 0 0025 h 1 at 0 1 to 0 0946 h 1 at 1000 1 and increased with increasing oxidant contaminant ratios fig 2 si table 4 the corresponding half live times decreased from 277 h at 100 1 to 7 h at 1000 1 oxidant contaminant ratio the 250 1 oxidant contaminant ratio was selected for a second set of experiments at the 250 1 ratio the dioxane oxidation reaction progressed slowly enough to permit frequent measurements including orp and ph all time points were measured in triplicate for dioxane concentration si table 5 the resulting pseudo first order reaction rate was k 0 0213 h 1 r2 0 965 fig 3 si table 5 and the corresponding half life time was t½ 33 h column experiments were conducted to obtain an understanding of the dioxane treatment by oxidation under dynamic flow through conditions an initial conservative tracer test shows that the column was packed homogenously and that preferential flow was negligible the distribution and arrival of the tracer front was observed with minor delay 1 09pv and dispersion was minimal 0 08pv however for reasons unknown the tracer mass recovery was 20 higher than expected 3 1 scenario i oxidant slug injection into two ports oxidant solution 100 ml or about 0 05pv each was injected into ports a and c along the column length fig 1 column effluent samples were collected every 12 min for 20 h or 1 93pv the ec measurements show two distinct peaks at 0 58 pv and 0 96 pv clearly reflecting the breakthrough of the two oxidant slugs fig 4 the ec peak value of the slug arriving at 0 96pv is roughly twice as high as the initial slug 5230 μs cm versus 2990 μs cm at the end of the experiment the effluent ec 1991 μs cm remained well above the column influent ec 0 3 μs cm the ph at the time of breakthrough of the first oxidant slug was 6 5 and fell to 6 0 by the time the second slug arrived fig

breakthrough of the second slug orp then steadily declined to 357 mv until the end of the experiment at that time the orp was more than twice as high relative to the column influent orp 167 mv data shown in si unlike the ec the orp readings were not additive when the slugs overlap the zeroth moment m0 which shows an oxidant mass recovery was 76 table c3 at the termination of the experiment regarding the dioxane concentrations co 302 μg l effluent concentrations declined upon the breakthrough of the first oxidant slug fig 4 the concentrations decreased to 188 μg l c co 0 62 at the time when the second slug arrived 0 96pv concentrations then rose again to 234 μg l at the end of the experiment which was 23 below the dioxane influent concentration as illustrated in fig 5 the dioxane degradation rates k were calculated from the effluent concentration data at the breakthrough of the first and second oxidant slug the rates for the breakthroughs of the two slugs were similar table 1 si fig 2 first k 0 20 h 1 second k 0 18 h 1 the average half live time was t½ 3 66 h with reference to the rates determined during the batch experiments fig 3 the corresponding oxidant contaminant ratio during the oxidant breakthrough was close to 1000 1 for comparison the oxidant contaminant ratio of full strength pap oxidant solution applied in the field is at least ten times greater 3 2 scenario ii single oxidant slug in the second treatment scenario one slug of pap oxidant of the same volume 200 ml or 0 1pv was injected at the base of the column fig 5 column effluent samples were collected for 3 1 pv 22h the ec measurements indicate that the breakthrough of the oxidant slug occurred at 1pv the maximum ec measurement was 4850 mv at 1 34pv which was similar 7 3 less than the maximum ec recorded during scenario i afterward the ec values decreased in a linear fashion until 2 7pv when ec sharply decreased at the end of the experiment the ec of the column effluent was similar to the influent the rise in orp coincided with the rise in ec but unlike the ec the orp readings remained at a near constant level 335 mv until 2 7 pv after which they deceased at a similar rate as the ec at the end of the experiment orp effluent readings were similar to the influent ones regarding the ph it dropped from 6 1 to 5 4 at the oxidant breakthrough and remained at that level until the termination of the experiment fig 5 the concentration of dioxane entering the column was held constant at 287 μg l at 1 1pv the concentration in the column effluent dropped sharply to 14 μg l and fell below the limit of detection 3 μg l by 1 9pv the dioxane concentration began to rebound afterward but was still 87 below the corresponding column influent concentration when the experiment was terminated as in scenario i the oxidation rate of dioxane for this experiment was calculated from the rate of degradation at the breakthrough the pap oxidant the rate table 1 k 1 539 h 1 was the highest of any experiment the corresponding half live time was t½ 0 45 h table 1 and the oxidant contaminant ratio during the oxidant breakthrough was close to full strength oxyzone oxidant solution applied under field conditions given the comparably high density differential between the oxidant solution 1 036 kg l injected into the column and the simulated dioxane groundwater plume 1 000 kg l we investigated if the observed tailing can be explained by density driven transport processes for this purpose a second tracer test was conducted with a higher nacl concentration solution 67 g l to mimic the density of the pap oxidant solution as shown in fig 6 the shape of the breakthrough curve of this nacl solution was similar to that of the oxidant and distinctively different from the low concentration nacl tracer testy density 1 0 kg l the main difference between the higher density btc is that the nacl solution exhibited a longer tailing relative to the pap oxidant together these three btcs indicate that density driven transport delayed and prolonged the transport of the pap oxidant slug through the column under vertical up ward flow conditions 4 discussion the purpose of these experiments was to determine the degradation rate of dioxane using pap oxidation in the presence of porous media oxidation rates and reaction kinetics were derived for varying oxidant contaminant ratios in batch scale studies to better understand how the porous media affects dioxane oxidation rates similar studies by eberle 2015 determined the rates of dioxane oxidation based on the same pap oxidant oxyzone as studied herein but with experiments conducted in aqueous solution only fig 3 the oxidation rates calculated in our research are 3 4 times slower than the rates reported by eberle et al 2015 although the underlying causes were not further investigated this observation suggests that previously reported aqueous phase rates likely overestimate how quickly the pap oxidant degrades dioxane when injected into a polluted aquifer therefore our results underline the importance of accounting for the porous material and its properties when planning for an injection of oxidant into a polluted aquifer or ex situ materials the column scale studies were only conducted once per scenario our investigation was limited to these two scenarios and did not explore the effects of different soil properties the influence of these properties are not easily estimated and have to be evaluated in further experiments 4 1 column scale experiments at real world contaminated sites dioxane is predominantly present in a dissolved state and forms elongated plumes of contaminated groundwater adamson et al 2014 hence its in situ treatment would likely require the injection of a solution containing a reactive agent such as the pap oxidant two different oxidant injection scenarios were tested in this study in scenario i oxidant slugs were injected at two locations along the main axis of the simulated dioxane plume in scenario ii only one oxidant slug but of the same volume as in scenario ii was injected into the base of the column prior to these experiments a conservative tracer test confirmed that flow field was homogenous and not influenced by preferential pathways which could have distorted the breakthrough curves of the dioxane and related parameters ec orp ph 4 2 scenario i the oxidant solution breakthrough occurs when the dioxane effluent concentration dropped to c co 0 62 and the orp remained consistently 5000 μs cm fig 4 although the dioxane concentration rose again while the tailing end of the oxidant eluted from the column it never reached the influent concentration co for the remainder of the experiment the apparent continued contaminant destruction during the later stages of the experiment correlates with the continued presence of oxidant in the column as indicated by the still elevated orp at the end of the experiment this suggests that the remaining oxidant fraction 24 based on the final mass recovery calculation moved more slowly through the column and continued to oxidize the dissolved dioxane past the time expected for a non reactive solute the ec data confirmed that the oxidant exhibited conservative transport characteristics in that they both arrived at the expected time 0 58pv first slug injected half way through the column and 0 96pv for the second slug the peak ec value of the second slug to 5230 μs cm at 0 96pv corresponded to an 12 oxidant concentration relative to the originally injected solution whereas at its peak the first slug was at 7 2990 μs cm at 0 58pv these results suggest that the slug injected at the inlet of the column must have caught up and overlapped with the slug injected halfway 0 75 m equivalent of 0 5 pv through the column unlike the ec readings the elevated orp readings after breakthrough of the first slug were not additive but remained constant within a narrow range when the second slug arrived fig 4 the similarity in orp is also reflected in the observed dioxane degradation rates which were similar during the arrival of the first and second oxidant slug 0 099 h 1 and 0 116 h 1 respectively these observations together suggest that there is no immediate benefit in terms of oxidation power by overlapping slugs of similar strength further it must be noted that the ec was used as a proxy of the pap oxidant concentration the fact that ec readings were additive and orp were not indicates that a fraction of the persulfate was consumed during the dioxane oxidation and converted to sulfate this conversion led to a reduction in the oxidation power of the oxidant but did not decrease the ec of the bulk solution this assessment is further supported when converting the observed dioxane degradation rates to the corresponding oxidant contaminant ratio of 1150 1 fig 2 which was 8 7 of the injected pap oxidant 10 000 1 ball 2010 the corresponding ec data indicates an apparent oxidant concentration of 12 the lower percentage derived from the oxidant contaminant ratio suggests that approximately 25 of the persulfate oxidant was converted to sulfate the scenario i test further demonstrated that the observed ph decline correlated with the rise in orp this result was expected because as the oxidant advances indicated by the rising orp sulfate so4 2 is produced by the persulfate reaction sulfate is a weak conjugate base which leads to the production of sulfuric acid the formation of sulfuric acid is partially buffered by the phosphate buffer which is part of this oxidant formulation although sufficient acid was produced to lower the ph to 6 5 a ph in that range would not be require an adjustment of the oxidant s buffer strength under real world conditions boving and ball 2020 4 3 scenario ii the injection of one slug at the base of the column was more effective than injecting two slugs as seen in scenario i the data shows near complete destruction of dioxane over a prolonged time approximately 1 7pv fig 5 the rate of destruction was more than an order of magnitude greater than in either scenario i or the batch experiments table 1 in fact the rate was very close to estimated degradation rate of full strength pap oxidant in contact with a porous medium although the dioxane degradation proceeded faster in the one slug scenario that in scenario i the results further underline the effect of the porous material during isco treatment while the observed prolonged effectiveness of the oxidant as indicated by consistently elevated orp even after the termination of the experiment can be considered beneficial for the in situ treatment this outcome was unexpected the data from a tracer test using a nacl solution with similar density to the pap oxidant suggests that the movement of the oxidant solution through the porous media was partially density driven that is the density contrast between the injected oxidant solution and the simulated groundwater plume was sufficiently large so that the oxidant slug resisted the transport by advection for some time until dispersion and dilution overcame the density differential the overall effect was a retardation of oxidant through the column which explains the observed apparent retardation of the oxidant and its prolonged reactivity it is unlikely that the observed density driven transport processed can be easily translated into an advantageous treatment scheme because it would the modification of groundwater flow to an upward direction it is however possible to inject the oxidant solution at or near the top of a polluted water table aquifer and then exploit the comparable high density of the oxidant solution to slowly finding its way into deeper parts of the aquifer such a scheme would require further testing and simulation beforehand but it potentially could result in cost savings related to fewer less deep injection wells and fewer oxidant injection events 5 conclusion this study investigates the degradation of 1 4 dioxane by pap oxidant in batch scale and column scale studies the batch scale studies establish oxidation rates for pap oxidation of dioxane in sand and proves that porous material significantly reduces the speed of oxidation the column scale studies examine the same oxidation processes under dynamic flow through conditions that mimic in situ treatment of groundwater plumes the results of this study confirm that pap oxidant effectively destroys dioxane in situ albeit at a lower rate compared to treating dioxane polluted water ex situ injecting pap solution into a dioxane contaminated plume appears as a promising isco technology but further research is needed to determine how density driven transport affects in situ remediation strategies author contributions all authors contributed equally to the conceptualization of the project cashman ball and boving were the main contributors to the
